tunity to do so.
Degrees of Honesty

The interviewer has distinguished
seven different categories which
generally characterize the degree of
academic honesty of Bucknell stu-
dents:

1. Students who are honest on the
basis of their moral principles—A
tiny minority.

2. Students who are hardly ever
dishonest because they don’t need to
cheat in order to get decent grades;
intelligent and interested students.—
A minority.

3. Students who are usually hon-
est but who resort to cheating as an
emergency measure.—A large min-
ority.

4. Students who are more or less

habitual cheaters in their first two i, conjunction with the department

years, but who partially or wholly
“reform” in their upper-class years.
—A large minority, possibly larger
than category 3.

5. Students who are habitual
cheaters throughout their under-
graduate years.—A smaller minority.

6. Students who pay for the ser-
vices of others (in category 7A
small minority?

7. Semi-professional operators.—A
small, delinquent elite.

The interviewer would no longer
be surprised if, through a general
student poli, it were established that
between 80 and 90% of all Bucknell
students have been involved in at
least one or more cases of cheating
during their Bucknell careers.

Most of Bucknell’s cheaters may
not be “habituals,” but the fact that
most students have cheated at one
time or another tends to make the
“habituals” feel rather comfortable
about the situation. Students some-
times are said to brag about cheat-
ing, finding in it, evidently, the pub-
ic acclaim of others.

Honest students who voice their
objections to such behavior say that
they are publicly ridiculed and
“made uncomfortable” by cheaters
and their open supporters. It seems
that, as in a gang-infested neighbor-
hood, the delinquent groups aggres-
sively dominate the scene by intimi-
dating the “good kids.” The major-
ity of honest students, thus, display
a far-reaching apathy in the face of
the cheating problem. A minority
seems to be disgusted with the sit
uation. In either case, however
they feel that they neither possibly
can nor that they should, do any-
thing about it The predominant

\and check the structure of his tes
|he should take great care not to r
| peat tests.

| We also recommend the establish-
‘ment of an official proctoring service
which will provide two properly se-
| lected and trainer proctors for ex-
aminations involving about 50 stu-
dents, and proportionally more for
| groups larger than 70. Proctoring
of large classes should not be left
| to instructors alone. To do so would
mean the perpetuation of present
practices which have been highly
ineffectual. In order to facilitate
proctoring, large classes should be
broken down into small sections
which could then be assigned to take
their examinations in separate
rooms. The Dean of the University,

chairmen, should take immediate
steps to provide this urgently need-
jed service.

| Punishment of offenders should be
fegifecr: severe, and without regard
| for persons.

| At the beginning of every course,
|students should be informed in de-
| tail as to precisely what acts consti-
‘tute cheating, and the nature of
| those acts should be defined.

ALL OFFENSES should be treat- |

ed in the following fashion:
First offense: Dismissal from class

jand failure in course; warning of

the consequences of a second offense.

Second offense: Dismissal from the
University Attempts at cheating
|should be treated in the same fash-
ion as successfully completed acts
of cheating Students who allow
others to copy in examinations or

who in other ways enable fellow-

students to cheat should be subject
to the same punishment as cheaters.

Students apprehended while en-
gaged in commercialized cheating

and/or of criminal delinquency con- j

nected with cheating should be im-
mediately expelled from the Univer-
sity. In cases of illegal acts of de-
linquency (such as burglary), the
possibilities of preferring criminal
charges Should be carefully consid-
ered.
Publication of Violators
We further recommend, in view

demic dishonesty is not enough. We
must realize that the problem does
not exist in vacuo. Hence, many
cognate matters should be carefully
studied, fearlessly reported, and,
after discussion by students, faculty
and administration corrected.

The 1960 L’Agenda is expected to
arrive from the printers next week
and will be available on Wednes-
day, Thursday, and Friday at the
|room opposite the post office in the
j basement of Roberts Hall.

Because of the cut in funds made
by the Student Budget Committee
last fall, it will be necessary to re-
| quire an additional fee of $1 from
each student to meet the cost of pub-
lication. All students, except seniors,
|for whom the ffee will be paid from
{the class treasury, are therefore re-
quested to present $1 along with
; their identification card when they
pick up their books.

‘Phi Bete Award

The Phi Beta Kappa award for
1960 goes to Robert Hecht for an
original and scholarly piece of scien-
tific research in the field of Biology
The award is made annually to the
student submitting the most out-
| standing creative or scholarly work
for consideration.

The following students submitted
|work for consideration this year:

Dr. Samuel C. Chu next year as an
| assistant professor in the history de-
;partment. Dr. Chu, who has been
:a-member of this University’s fac-
‘ulty for two years, has accepted the |
position of an associate professor of |
‘history at the University of Pitts-|
| burgh.
Dr. Chu came to the United States |

in 1941, did his undergraduate study |:

‘at Dartmouth College, and received |
his M. A. and his Ph. D. from Co-}
lumbia University. In June, 1958, !
jhe came to Bucknell. Dr. Chu di- |
rected the Institute for Asian Studies
beginning that summer and will do!
so again this year after which time}
Dr. Lu will handle the task.

When asked about leaving this
University, Dr. Chu remarked that
it was a “hard decision to make,
but that his “professional obligation
over personal desires won.” At the
Univ. of Pittsburgh, Dr. Chu will
help to enlarge the Chinese studies
program which is to be financed by
a grant from the United States gov-
| ernment. There, the challenge is
available to develop a graduate pro-
gram in this field commencing with
the masters level and ultimately in-
stituting studies on the doctorate
\level, a program which would be
impossible at Bucknell. On the un-
dergraduate level at Pittsburgh one
of four basic courses about Asia will
be a requirement. This situation
will enable Dr. Chu to “work Asia
into the total consciousness of the
undergraduate student,” for, he be-
lieves, “in this age every undergrad-
uate should have some awareness of
Asia.” And with so few students in

his classes here, Dr. Chu is able to |:
affect only a very small percentage |=

of the number he wishes to reach.
Dr. Lu

Dr. Lu, who as an assistant pro-
fessor will take over all of Dr. Chu’s
classes without any changes, has
been appointed with the assistance
of Dr. Chu, who is a friend of his
replacement. Dr. Lu will also serve
as a section lecturer in the western
civilization course, since he also has
a background in European history.

Dr. Lu’s academic training began
at the Taihoku High School in For-
mosa and was continued at the Col
lege of Law, National Taiwan Uni-
versity in Formosa, where he re-
ceived his B. A. degree. Having
jearned his M. I. A. certificate from

~ Bisons Face 6-Burg in Chocolate Bow!

Soccer Team Meets

Penn Stafe Tomorrow

| Bucknell’s soccer team, 1960
version, could best be described
/as building, even though that ob-
|servation is not totally accurate.
|Hank Peter’s squad has been hit
so hard by graduation that prac-
tically a whole new backfield is
“needed. Unfortunately, material
to supply that backfield is ex-
‘tremely limited in that there are
jonly 18 out for 11 positions. Of
/twenty men expected up from
‘the undefeated freshman team of
\last year only four were able to
‘report, the rest falling by the
‘wayside due to scholastic defici-
encies. Graduation took Steve
Flamhaft, Grant Watkins, Rodger
|Mackey, and Jack Woerner, all
starters.

Despite the small size of the
squad, they have been going at it
since a week before school, run-
|ning through two practices a day,
‘every man on the team sustain-
jing at least one injury. The Bison
booters have a rugged schedule
‘ahead of them, opening against
|Penn State tomorrow, and then
\taking on Temple and Navy. The
;squad plays ten games. The BU
team molded a thrilling upset
,over State last year 2-1, before
the largest soccer crowd in Buck-
nell history. Seeking a repeat of
last year’s triumph will be this
|probable starting lineup. At the
\férward positions will be Frank
Famariss, and Bill ahl at the
|wings. Dunc Hubley and Dave
Bogar will be the insides with
high scoring Lyman Ott at center
forward. Halfbacks will be Bob
| Schad, co-captain with Ott, soph
| Bill Oakes and Frank Lineaweav-
er. Cap Wiel and Tom Hitchcock
| will fill the fullback spots, while
Howie Levine will handle the
‘ goalie’s. chores.

Bisons Topple
Muhlenberg in
Scrimmage, 45-7

Despite an inexperienced line
and a poor first half the 1960 edi-
tion of the Bucknell football team
stomped on Muhlenberg last Sat-
urday 45-7 in a pre-season scrim-
mage. The Bisons rolled up 38
points in the second half as they
gave an exciting preview of the
offensive power which will be on
display tomorrow night at Her-
shey Stadium. Just about every
back on the team got into the
scoring act. All four quarterbacks
found the range as All-Confer-
ence Paul Terhes passed for one
touchdown and ran 20 yards to}
tally a second, Doug Williams |
and Ron Giordano, both sophs, as |
well as senior Rick Elliott, found
targets, while soph Dick Johnson
rambled 61 yards to add to the)
Mules misery. Williams ended
the game by sneaking over from |
two yards out with only seconds
remaining.

While neither team was partic-
ularly active in the first half, the
Bisons appeared to be a different
squad when they ‘took the field
for the second stanza. Since
there were no kickoffs, each team
taking the ball on their own 30-}

yard line after a score, Bucknell
had only to go 70 yards in twelve
plays to get their offensive steam-
roller under way. Following the}
Terhes to Maslanik score it was |
all Bucknell.

Junior guard Bob Williams,
junior tackle Tom Noteware and
sophomore guard Tom Sefanakos,
all of whom were out with minor
injuries, were the only members|
of the 41-man squad who did not|
see action. Sorely needing greater
depth at several positions Odell
and his staff have made quite a
few position changes since last
fall. Junior Tom Alexander, a
center last year is now a starting
guard where his speed is utilized
to a greater advantage. Junior
Jake Flyzik has been moved from
guard to center and junior Kirk
Foulke is back at tackle, his 1959
position, after playing at center
in spring practice. Garrity and
West, both quarterbacks until last
week, surprised as running half-
backs. Both boys weigh only
150 pounds. Pat Malone, a letter
winner at halfback last fall, has
been moved to end to help fill in
for graduation losses.

Tom Noteware, a fullback as a
freshman, an end last year and a
center for the first two weeks of
fall practice has been moved to
tackle to make room for sopho-
more pivot men Dean Stump of
Johnstown, Pa. and George Rieu
of Atlantic City, N. J. Both boys
have impressed in early practice
work with Stump expected to get
the starting nod in the opener
against Gettysburg on Saturday.
In the other big position change
junior Bill Urch, a letterman at
halfback as a sophoore, has been
switched to fullback to fill in for
the loss of Captain-elect George
Moncilovich. Mono, the Bisons’
leading ground gainer last year,
was declared ineligible under a
special NCAA ruling governing
transfer students.

Tomorrow night marks the
seventh meeting between Buck>
nell and Gettysburg in the Annual
Rotary Bowl Classic. Each team
has wone the Bow! three times.
In the complete series of games
between BU and Gettysburg the
Bisons have won 28, while losing
14, and tieing two games. Paul

MONDAY MORNING |
QUARTERBACK

In pre-season speculation on}
the merits of individual football
teams, the natural inclination is}
to incline towards your own fav- |
orite sons. An optomistic tack is |
obviously the only one than can}
be taken. Often times there is |
sufficient grounds for favoritism, |
but more often than not the case
is one of wishful thinking. Such
is not the case with Bucknell’s |
1960 rendition of intercollegiate
football.

Paul Terhes is finally a senior,
and traditionally quarterbacks
improve with age. By all reports
Turk has done anything but back-
slide. The strong-armed native
of Ridley Park, Pa. has led the
MAC for two consecutive seasons
and there is every reason to be-
lieve that he can do it again.
While the loss of Jack Eachus,
the conference’s leading receiver,
is serious, Ron Maslanik spelled
6-3 Eachus enough last season to
give him first line experience.
Maslanik and converted halfback
Pat Malone, who is adept enough
to catch his own passes, should be
able to provide the type of re-
ceiving /Terhes is accustomed to
having. The two juniors will also
be hard pressed by several soph
eatchers which should lend to
their incentive.

Last year’s entire forward wall

‘is gone, but Coach Bob Odell pru- |

dently used a two platoon system |
last season, featuring the “Mon-
Sev-

lot of action because of this and |
consequently there will be a lot|
of experienced beef, at least on|
the first team. Kirk Foulke, Tom |
Alexander, Denny Morgan, and |
Don Chaump are all vastly im-|
proved and as long as they can |
keep a sharp edge in each game,
the Bison line will be as solid as |
its ever been. Naturally, these |
four won’t be expected to go the |
full sixty, but while there is a lot |
of weight on the reserves, experi- |
ence s not at an all time high. |

The tentative starting lineup!
for tomorrow night’s clash will!
cgnsist of Terhes at quarterback, |
Ashton Ditka and Captain Mickey |
Melberger at the halfbacks with |
Ken twiford holding down thé!
fullback slot. At the ends will!
be Malone and Maslanik, while
Chiump and Alexander will be
the guards. With Morgan and
Foulke at the tackles, sophomore |
Dean Stump will handle the cen-
ter spot. |

Summer School Filled

Enrollment in Bucknell Univer- |
sity’s 1960 summer session was at
its highest peak in ten years, ac- |
cording to. figures released by
George R. Faint, registrar. |

Based on the number of stu-|
dents enrolled in undergraduate |
and graduate sessions plus those |
attending one of the four special |
summer institutes, the registra- |
tion figure now stands at’774, an |
increase of 18 per cent over that
of the previous year.

Students ‘engaged in graduate |
and special study account for al-
most 40 per cent of the total en-
roliment, while those attending
the special summer institutes |
make up the second largest group. ;

tute for Foreign Students.

Mickey Melberger Named Captain Of Football Team

Mickey Melberger, a senior|in the backfield, Melberger gain-
halfback from West Pittston, Pa.,
has been elected captain of the
1960 Bucknell University football

team.

One of three returning starters

his coaches to turn in his top per-
formance this fall and is a good
bet for All-Middle Atlantic Con-

as

Man, claims Tillich, can be)

profane”. It is a series of un-
solved paradoxes. As is life, so
is Man. Since equal attracts
equal, any object can be a med-
ium through which the Eros can
be achieved.
Three Types

Tillich discussed three types of
“Creative Listening’: the Aca-
demic, Conversational, and Lis-
tening to Ourselves. So often the
college student never really lis-
tens. He goes through college
waiting for the stimulating pro-
fessor, the outstanding course;
he fails to realize that the Eros is
found instead in Reality itself.
We can be creative only when we
can be open to the Reality, only
when we can experience it. Crea-
tive education can never be a
passive experience; instead it
must be a matter of personal con-
cern. Only when we experience
this concern or the will to change

what we learn, can creativity |

exist.

Creative listening can and does
take place in interaction between
persons. Typical college conver-
sations usually do more to hinder
than help the process. However,
since gossip, quick, concise, to the
point answers, technical consider-
ations and the recollection of en-
tertaining tidbits are ofttimes a
polite way of preventing a real
union.

Dr. Tillich Discusses ‘Creative Listening’
Before Full Audience During Convocation

This union becomes possible
only when silence has become
possible, “an exchange of thoughts
through silence”. When this
union has taken place, creative
listening can be utilized even in
superficial conversation. It be-
comes a method by which we can
listen to what a person is trying
to say, rather than what he ac-
tually would seem to communi-
cate

Finally Dr. Tillich in his dis-
cussion of Listening to Ourselves
pointed out that in each of us
there are voices which point to
the sublime. These voices are
those which force us to ask ques-
tions about the meaning of real-
lity. They serve to raise us from
complacency and force us to ex-
|amine and to strive for the an-
swers to these disturbing ques-
tions. They force us to listen and
‘think creatively!
| Modern life, however, has be-
| come too busy. Man can shut the
voice out in the trivial details of

daily existence. If the human
/Tace ever succeeds in killing this
| voice, it will, with the same bul-
let, destroy creativity.

| Instead of the usual convoca-
‘tion statements full of idealistic
imessages about studying harder
and being well rounded, Tillich

STAFF REVEALS STEPS IN BIRTH

Company by Editor:

Extra! Extra! Read all about
it! Bucknell’s latest baby makes
banner appearance Friday, Sep-'
tember 23rd. The NEW Buck-)
nellian is born. |

This year the Bucknellian takes |
on a streamlined look. The new!
tabloid-size edition is designed |
to report the best of “all that’s}
fit to print” concisely and accu-|
rately. During the past few
months, the editorial staff has!
been planning the first editions of
“our new baby”. The last week
has been busy but rewarding,
culminating in the presentation
of this new paper. In this first
issue, we share with all Bucknell-
ians, old and new, the exciting
steps leading to the birth of an
issue.

Every issue of the Bucknellian
has its beginning in weekly edi-
torial staff meetings. Under the
direction of Editor-in-Chief Jan}
Powers, the staff plans. each edi-
tion two weeks in advance. Ideas |
for good news stories, pictures, |
features, and editorials are tossed |
back and forth. “Hot tips” in-
evitably come to the fore.

Sometimes it is difficult to dis- |
tinguish this staff meeting from
that of a debating society. Often
there are animated discussions, |
producing some fire works, before
the staff can agree about the|
“stand” that will be taken on a-
controversial topic. Finally, the
lead stories and a general idea of |
page layout are decided upon and |
the meeting is adjourned. i

News Gathered j

Story assignments for a coming
issue filter down from the editors |
to writers, reporters and cub re-
porters. Bucknellians from all}
classes enjoy interviewing and}
getting \better acquainted with |
faculty, other students, and vari- |
ous newsworthy personalities. No |
one is more excited than a re-|
porter who discovers that he has
been assigned the “scoop of the
week”.

After all the information is}
gathered, the newsmonger sits
down to the challenging task of {
fitting the facts together into an |
interesting piece of copy. Eight j
o'clock Sunday night is the dead- !
line when all reporters deposit
their creative efforts into the
Bucknellian box in Harris Hall. |

PIANIST TO PLAY
IN ARTIST SERIES

World-renowned pianist, Vanj

Cliburn, will open the 1960-1961
Artist Series with a concert in
the Davis Gymnasium on Wed-
nesday, October 12, at 8:15 p. m.

Mr. Lindsey Merrill, faculty
chairman of the Artist Series
Committee, has announced that
General Admission tickets for this
concert may be purchased for
$3.00. Students will be admitted
by showing their identification
cards.

Traveling to Moscow in the
spring of 1958, Van Cliburn es-
tablished his fame in the music
world by playing the Tchaikow-
sky Concerto No. 1 in B Flat
Minor, Op. 23, in the First Inter-
national Tchaikowsky Competi-
tion. He won the competition, as
well as the acclaim of the Russian
people and critics. _New York

Raskin to (Open
Student Forum

Marc G. Raskin will present a
discussion of Germ Warfare for
the first Bucknell Student Forum
program. The program will start
at 7:30 in Vaughan Literature
Auditorium on October 5.

Mr. Raskin is well qualified to

s many phases of American

and development. As leg-

> assistant to United States
Congressman Kastenmeier, Wolf,
; Roos t, Kasem, Toll and John-
|son, he has attended numerous
| cengressional committee meetings
and helped these congressmen
| write bills.

As Staff Secretary to the
Foreign Policy Task Force of the
‘Democratic Study Group in Con-
gress, he has been discussing this

other subjects of na-
tional and international interest
with 120 Congressional members
|during the past session of Con-
'gress. He is also the Secretar
of the Congressional Liberal Pro
ect, a group of prominent legis-
lators and government specialists
who meet to discuss foreign and
| domestic problems throughout the
| congressional year.

Due to the fact ‘that so few
Bucknellians, and for that matter,
so few Americans, know anything
about germ and chemical war-
fare, Mr. Raskin will open his
program with a resume of recent
developments in this field which
would be pertinent to his discus-
sion. This topic has aroused a

Seventy Graduates Continue Education;

Debatable Debate

Pitched in the first of a series of four televised debates,
Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice-President Richard F.
Nixon played marbles with political trivia for an hour
Wednesday night.

In his opening statement about America’s standstill,
Kennedy spoke glibly of rights due a Negro baby born in
this country. Nixon countered Kennedy’s statement with
the declaration that America was on the move and had
been so for the past seven and a half years. He did not
touch on the question of civil rights at any time during
the evening.

More than half of the program time consisted of replies
to questions formulated by four representatives from
sponsoring networks. One reporter confronted Nixon
with President Eisenhower’s remark that he could think
of nothing contributed by Nixon during his term of office.
Rising to the occasion with equanimity, Nixon countered
his inquisitor with the assurance that Ike’s remark was
merely facetious, for he could not possibly reveal the
identity of his advisors. :

Dulling a barbed question, this repartee was as dazzling
as the glittering generalities of “freedom” and “progress”
which dripped like sticky honey from Kennedy’s tongue.

What was the good of these debates? Neither man
concerned himself with major issues of party or country.
Vying with each other to: present the most scintillating
image of potential presidency, both candidates fingered
cliches with surprising ease.

On a stark stage, Peck’s Bad Boy extolled the virtues
of a democratic platform surprisingly similar to that of
the Republicans, described in words from the cadaverous
face of the vice president. Having no audience reaction
to play their words against, Kennedy and Nixon struggled
to appear keen opponents of each other.

The result was an ineffectual discussion, leaving the
viewer with little or nothing on which to base his allegi-
ance. The candidates took no distinct stands on major
issues, sallying instead from side to side in an attempt to
pick up votes. Even traditional party ideologies were
absent from their speeches. Compromising for the sake
of votes has reduced the level of competition to the per-
sonal appeal of Kennedy versus that of Nixon.

We would hope that the next three debates, scheduled
for October 7, 13 and 21, will show that the two candi-
dates have committed themselves to stands on major is-
sues. Surely Nixon can speak of living standards in terms
less emotional than, “poverty I have known.” Similarly,
Kennedy’s “rendezvous with destiny” seems hardly the
eampaign note of a Nobel Prize winner.

THE PLEDGE YOU SAVE
MAY BE YOUR OWN

Today’s column is directed at those young female under-
graduates who have recently pledged sororities and are wor-
ried, poor lambs, that they won’t make good. Following is a
list of simple instructions which, if faithfully observed, will
positively guarantee that you will be a mad success as a

sorority girl.

First, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The
housemother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You
must treat her with respect. When you wish to speak to her,
address her as ‘“Mother Sigafoos” or ““Ma’am.”” In no circum-
stances must you say, “Hey, fat lady.”

Second, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on
the front porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and
shows a want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.

Third, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing
meals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your
cook goes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu varied
and nourishing. The least you can do is show your apprecia-
tion. Don’t just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with
delight, ‘What delicious pork jowls!” or “What a yummy soup
bone!’”’ or “What scrumptious fish heads!” or ‘What clear

water!”

Fourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance re-
flects not just on yourself but on the whole house. It was
well enough before you joined a sorority to lounge around
campus in your old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now
you must take great pains to dress in a manner which excites
admiring comments from all who observe you. A few years ago,
for example, there was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk
at the University of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her
sorors. Camille hit on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb

still another first in its history, coed classes. The measure while still
a radical one in college circles is a sensible one. The girls occupy
the west side of one of the large rooms on the second floor of Taylor
Hall and must face the West at all times, the young men are confined
| to the east side of the room and similiarly are required to face the
| East.

In commenting on the monumental advances that have been
| made here in the past three years, Dr. Taylor has released the follow- |
| ing statement:

Any student who waited for forty-five minutes in line
for Registration was justified in his grumblings about this
necessary evil. The procedure was simple: (1) Receive
student ID cards; (2) fill out address cards for switchboard
and handbook use; (3) pick up treasurer’s release slip; (4)
obtain registration envelope. Why did it take each stu-
dent at least half an hour to go through these four steps?

Dear Freshmen: |

ments—$:00 class,

ments?

(We will not comment on the further time required for
those who had schedule changes.)

At the risk of becoming self-named efficiency experts,
we would suggest several changes which might vastly
improve the efficiency of the registration procedure.

Name and address cards could be mailed in advance
and returned prior to registration day. Perhaps including
these cards in the registration envelope, with directions
to fill them out before leaving the gym, would also elim-
inate some confusion and minimize the time spent in reg-
istration.

Retarding the process most, however, was a lack of per-
sonnel prepared to handle the registration influx. Sure-
ly, more student help could be utilized at such points as
the ID card pick-up station, and in the distribution of
name and address cards, treasurer’s release cards and
class schedules. By further dividing the line alphabeti-
cally at each of these points, waiting time could be re-
duced considerably.

Furthermore, an early registration for counselors, proc-
tors, head residents, WSGA officers, and athletic team
members was planned to include far too many people for
the time allotted to them. Granting special registration
rights for every group requesting it resulted in sev-
eral delays throughout the procedure. Perhaps the num-
ber of groups should be limited.

Pre-registration of class schedules, as we now have it,

is commendable. However, we should not overlook the
fact that the remaining registration procedure, as it
stands now, could be more efficient.

exceed three candidates for the
fellowships. These appointments
are fundamentally “a relationship
of encouragement” throughout
the years of graduate study,
carrying a promise of financial
aid within prescribed conditions
as there may be need. The maxi-
mum annual grant for single Fel-
lows is $1500 plus tuition and fees
charged to all graduate students;
for married Fellows, $2000 plus
tuition and fees charged to all
graduate students with an addi-
tional stipend of $500 for each
child. Students with or without
financial need are invited to ap-
ply. ‘

A Danforth Fellow is allowed
to carry other scholarship ap-
pointments, such as Rhodes, Ful-
bright, Woodrow Wilson, Mar-
shall, ete., concurrently with his
Danforth Fellowship, and appli-
cants for these appointments are
cordially invited to apply at the
same time for a Danforth Fellow-
ship. If a man received the Dan-
forth Appointment, together with
a Rhodes Scholarship, Fulbright
Scholarship, or Woodrow Wilson
Fellowship, he becomes a Dan-
forth Fellow without stipend,
until these other relationships are
completed.

All Danforth Fellows will par-
ticipate in the annual Danforth
Foundation Conference on Teach-
ing, to be held at Camp Miniwan-
ca in Michigan next September.

The qualifications of the can-
didates are: men of outstanding
academic ability, personality con-
genial to the classroom, and in-
tegrity and character, including
serious inquiry within the Christ-
ian tradition.

All applications, including the
recommendations, must, be com-
pleted by January 15. Any stu-
dent wishing further information
should contact Dr. Heine.

ROTC Dept. Reveals
Frosh Poll Results

Each year with the appearance
of the freshman men, a contro-
versy arises concerning compul-
sory ROTC training. Recently, a
poll was conducted among the
freshman men consisting of a
single question, “Would you have
chosen ROTC if it were not com-
pulsory?” The cadets were in-
structed to answer the question
“yes” or “no” and then to add any
remarks they desired.” .

The results showed that 61%
favored the ROTC program, 29%
were not in favor of the program,
and 10% were undecided or pre-
ferred training in some branch
other than the Army. According
to the accompanying remarks, the
greatest cause of disfavor for the
course was that it consumed val-
uable study time from academic
subjects. Others answered nega-
tively, stating, “The time served
does net reduce one’s military ob-
and declared,
|was a lack of information con-
cerning the details of the program
prior to our entrance.”

Management Internships will be|with the presentation of The

Birth of a Nation (1915). The
story is that of the Civil War and
the Reconstruction Period. His-
torical events such as Sherman’s
march to the sea, the burning of
Atlanta and the assassination of
Lincoln are presented with pain-
staking care.

If any one film can lay any
claim of importance in the history
and development of the motion
picture as an art form, Birth of a
Nation must certainly have that
distinction. It was the first fea-
ture-length production in the U.
S. and premiered at the Liberty
Theatre in New York.

The cast includes Henry B.
Wallhall, Mae Marsh, Lillian
Gish, Wallace Reid and Donald
Crisp. There is no sound dialogue
but the original musical score by
Joseph Carl Breil will be featur-
ed.

Shows will start at 7 and 9
p. m. at the Vaughan Literature
building.

A second printing of On the
Arkansas Route to California in
1849, a historical account of six
forty-niners who made the trip
from Lewisburg to California, is
now available to students and
others interested in American his-
tory.

Edited by Dr. J. Orin Oliphant,
professor of history at Bucknell,
and published by the Bucknell
University Press, the book is
baséd on a diary written by
Robert G. Green, one of the tra-
velers. :

wore a buskin and jerkin. To German she wore lederhosen and
carried a stein of pilsener. To Econ she wore 120 yards of

dressed as a white mouse for Psych Lab. Not only her Chi

Finally, let us take up the most important topic of all. I

refer, of course, to dating.

As we have seen, the way you dress reflects on your sorority,
but the men you date reflect even more. Be absolutely certain
that your date is an acceptable fellow. Don’t beat about the

bush; ask him point-blank, ‘

‘Are you an acceptable fellow?”

Unless he replies, “Yeah, hey,” send him packing.

But don’t just take his word that he is acceptable. Inspect
him closely. Are his fingernails clean? Is his black leather
jacket freshly oiled? Is his ukelele in tune? Does he carry
public liability insurance? And, most significant of all, does

he smoke Marlboros?

Tf he’s a Marlboro man, you know he has taste and discern-
ment, wit and wisdom, character and sapience, decency and
warmth, presence and poise, talent and grit, filter and flavor,

CHEMISTRY PROF
WINS FELLOWSHIP

Dr. Manning A. Smith, profes-
sor of chemistry, has been award-
ed a Science Faculty Fellowship
by the National Science Founda-
tion for study abroad during the
1960-61 academic year.

Under the Foundation’s cooper-
ative research program, Dr. Smith
arrived in Goteberg, Sweden, last
month, where he will work with
Professor Trich Adler, director of
the Institute for Organic Chemi-
cals, at the Chalmers University
of Technology.

For several years Professor Ad-
ler and Dr. Smith have been pub-
lishing research on the reaction
between periodic acid and certain
organic structures called phenols.

Thus the Fellowship award from |

the Foundation will enable them
to work together.

For several years Dr. Smith has
been assisting the U. S. Depart-
ment of Interior in its successful
effort to find an economical and
effective chemical compound to
eradicate the sea lamprey popu-
lations in the Upper Great Lakes
Region.

Dr. Smith is scheduled to re-
turn to campus in time for the
beginning of the 1961 fall semes-
ter.

been discussed in the American
| press.

| For those freshmen who are
‘not acquainted with the Student
| Forum, a brief resume of its goals
jand past performance is worth-
while. The Forum was organized
two years ago by a group of
seiors who convinced their class
to donate their-class gift for the
purpose of founding a group to
bring to this campus speakers of
interest to the college commun-
ity. The goal. of the Student
Forum is to introduce the college
community to matters currently
of concern to our society and to
stimulate them to discuss and
consider thoughtfully the ques-
tions raised.

Last year, the Forum presented
| programs on Negro voting rights,
censorship of literature, corrup-
tion in labor unions, the future
of avant-garde theatre in Ameri-
ca, and “An American Commun-
ist Looks at American Democ-
racy.”

Currently, the Forum plans to
present this year a program in

Chaump Injured

Bucknell’s. semi-dramatic vic-
ver Gettysburg last Satur-
well have been a
stly one. Junior guard Don

Chaump, from West Pittston, P:
was helping on a tackle on the
B-Burg 10 yagd line when he sus-
tained an injury that will prob-

ably knock him out for the re
of the season. “Chaumper’s” leg
was broken below the knee. The
bone was broken complet but
in such a way that there was no
separaton, and thereby no setting
required. By the time trainer

Hal Biggs had arrived at the hos- |

pital where Don was taken by
ambulance, the massive guard
was already in a cast. He return-
ed to classes Tuesday, but will
probably remain out of action for
the remainder of thé season.

Don will be a real loss to Buck-
nell as he was counted upon to
handle guard duty extensively
this season. He lettered last year
and is deeply respected for his
hard-hitting brand of football.
He had even been slated for pos-
sible MAC honors. Senior John

| Aucker will probably be picked
| to fill Chaump’s shoes, with soph- |

omore Chuck Johnson giving him

Eleven Punts
Bucknell’s game with Gettys-
burg was semi-dramatic in that

| while there were some interesting

nd unusual plays made, the con-

'test was for the most part drud-

gery for both fans and players.
The show featured 11 punts.

The Bisons were dogged with
frustration during most of the
second quarter. They just couldn’t

‘find the range when they got be-

neath the goal past’s shadow.
Coach Bob Odell played two full

teams extensively and both got
jan opportunity to score
| Among the odd pl that came
{up in the game, besides Tom
| Alexander's mystifying punt, was
Bob Williams’ interception of a
\Gettysburg pass. Williams, a
linebacker, dropped back a few
yards and picked off Earl Little’s
| rial. Staring at the football
|unbelievingly for a split second,
Williams then started up the
field. For ten yards or so he
looked like a full-fledged full-
back, but then suddenly you knew
he was a lineman. Bob's ‘spark-
ling play went for naught how-
ever as the Bisons were forced to
punt four plays later.
Odds and Ends

Soph lineman Dick Orlowski
suffered the plight of many near-
sighted juggernaughts. He
thought he lost one of his contact
lenses at the end of the first half.
He found it underneath his eye-
‘lid. Two Gettysburg punts land-
‘ed 6” over the goal line. Had
{they stayed in play the Bisons
would have been in real trouble.
|As it was they got the ball on
\their own twenty. Ken Twiford
jended the game on a spectacular
jnote. He intercepted a pass on
| the G-Burg 40 yard line and head-
{ed for home, only to fumble on
| Gettysburg’s 20. Two desperation
passes by the Bullets and it was
all over. “Turk” completed 5 of
11 passes for 51 yards

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1960.
Bucknell Downs
Gettysburg 14-7

For nearly three and a half
quarters last Saturday night at
Hershey the Gettysburg line held
halfback Ray Cosgrove to -1 yard
on the ground. Only about five
minutes remained in the contest
when the 5-10 junior suddenly
began to play inspired football.
Rambling Ray carried the ball six
times in the Bisons final drive to
victory. Cosgrove gained 36
yards of the 80 the Bucknell team
moved in the closing minutes, be-
sides scoring the winning touch-
down. Completely stifled in the
first three sessions, Ray went over
from one yard out to give the BU
Bisons their first victory of the
young 1960 season.

Twiford, Johnson Shine

Fullback Ken Twiford and
soph halfback Dick Johnson also
sparkled for Bucknell. Twiford
made the key play of the game
when he caught a Paul Terhes
pass and moved 16 yards down
to the Gettysburg 45 yard line in
that late touchdown drive. The
Bisons were faced with a third-
and-thirteen situation when Twi-
ford came through in the clutch.

Dick Johnson electrified Her-
shey stadium with a magnificent
36 yard run to tally Bucknell’s
first touchdown late in the-second
period.

The fleet soph halfback looked
every part the veteran as he
caught a pass from Terhes in the
flat and headed for the sidelines.
Only inches from the out-of-
bounds marker he skirted two
G-Burg defenders, picked up a
fine block thrown by Tom Note-
ware, and cut towards midfield.
With the aid of blacks by Chuck
Johnson, Dick Tyrrell, and John
Sommers, he crossed the goal line
standing up. Dick then proceed-
ed to boot the extra point, and
then following with the kickoff.

Although the score ran 14-7, the
Bisons threatened three times in
the second quarter before finally
scoring on Johnson’s run. Each
time they pushed to within the

\ten yard line and tach time they
| were repulsed.
| Alexander’s Punt

Gettysburg tallied their lone
TD under unusual circumstances.
On a fourth down situation in the

| third period junior Tom Alexan-
der received a high pass from
center. The ball flipped out of
his reach and when he finally
picked it up on his own 15 yard
line he was surrounded by Bullet
defenders. Breaking loose, he got
off a wobbly kick which end Ron
Maslanik mistook for a forward
pass. Maslanik had his back to
the play and turned around just
in time to grab the ball. He gain-
ed about 10 yards before being
brought down by Gettysburg.
When the smoke and confusion
had cleared Gettysburg had the
ball on Bucknell’s 23 yard line.
Since the play had started on the
BU 38,, the sons lost the ball
and 15 yards as they were tagged
with illegal procedure.
| Bullet quarterback Earl Little
passed Gettysburg down to the
Bisons seven and three plays later
the score was 7-7

By the beginning of the fourth

ed up his second tally, while
senior Dave Bogar headed the
ball into the net to score. Howie

CORNELL PREVIEW

As Coach Lefty James sends his

Cornell eleven onto the gridiron | '¥

this Saturday afternoon he may
be somewhat less than nostalgic
at the prospect of meeting his
alma mater. An end under Buck-
nell’s Carl Snavely from 1927 to
1930, Lefty has come to be known
as one of the “most accomplished
leaders in the game.”

It would seem as though the
Big Red could use an accomplish-
ed leader at this point. Highly
touted in the pre-season coverage,
Cornell now seems crippled al-
most beyond repai:

Senior Marcy Tino, who was
last year’s starting quarterback,
was slated along with junior Dave
McKelvey to_do big things for the
men of Ithaca. Coach James uses
a slot-T offense. After alternat-
ng McKelvey and Tino at the
quarterback spot last year nel
found that he was wasting tal-
ent, and so shifted Tino over to
left halfback and put McKelvey
at quarterback permanently. Or
so he thought.

All this must have made every- |
one at Ithaca very happy. Also, |
in addition to the fast, hard hit-
ting Tino and the smooth accur-
ate passing McKelvey, there were
18 lettermen returning and sev-
eral promising sophomores com-
ing up. Cornell looked forward
to bettering last year’s 5-4 record. |

half Colgate had scored four)
touchdowns and completely throt*
tled the Cornell offensive ma-
chine. In the second half Cor-
nell was to come back enough to
score once and pile up more yard-
age on the ground and in the air
than Colgate, but the game ended
in a 28-8 victory for a team that
last year won only twice and this
year has lost almost its entire
line. .
But no matter how humiliating
this opening defeat may be, the
Big Red will not slink into this |
Saturday’s game wth its tail be-
tween its legs. Tino and McKel-
vey were considered as one of the
best combinations in the Ivy
League. They may be out, but 18
lettermen covering all positions
remain. If James can develop a
pair of operational ends, Cornell
can spring back. One answer is
last season’s regular slot back,
John Beggs, a senior who has had |
experience at end. Another may
be Lewisburg’s John Fenton who
started several games last season.

Feeney Hurt

Missing this year will be Dave
Feeney, an all-Ivy guard in 1959.
His able replacement will be cap-
tain Warren Sundstrom. Sund-
strom has exceptional speed and
has been outstanding as a line-
backer.

As for the question of the back-
field, the answer may be Bob Ritz
who took over for McKelvey last
Saturday or any one of several |Q
other understudys. George Telesh |
will be starting at fullback. He
is a quick starter and a hard run:
ner with good speed, and Coach |
James will no doubt be counting |
heavily on him.

James’ revised Slot-T depends |
more on speed than previously.
The right halfback used to be)
chiefly a blocker, but now runs}
the ball and catches passes. }
George Ekstrom who has run the}
60 yard dash in 6.2 seconds and}
who last year averaged 4.8 yards |
per carry fills this key position. |
Along with Telesh, he is possibly |
one of the few bright spots in the |
Cornell backfield. |

Soccer Referees Needed!

Bus Blum is urgently in need
of soccer referees for intramur:
al contests which begin next
week. If there is no response
to the call, referees will be ap-
pointed from the several fra-

Blind Bucknellian Looks
To Students for Help

As many of yeu roved around the Bucknell Campus last year,
perhaps you were confronted by a person wielding a cane.

For those of you who never bothered to make the acquaintance
with this individual, and for those who just found out a name and
the reason for the cane, and for those of you who did get to know

this person and are interested in knowing a little more about him, I}

shall try to give you a short biography of this person and some other
information about him, for I am the man with the cane.

I also hope that this article will be of some help for the present
Freshman class in getting to know me.

First, my reason for carrying the cane is to assist me in travel-
ing from place to place, for as you might guess, I am blind. I am
sure that the cane has caused, and will cause, many of you to do some
fancy stepping to avoid being tripped. For this inconvenience to

you, I apologize. I can assure you that other than not having quite

as much sight as you do, I am just like you.

I do hope that if you must do some fancy stepping that you will
not just walk the other way, or pass without saying a word; I hope
you will stop and say hello and introduce yourself. Even if it isnot
the first time we have met, I would appreciate it if you would still
mention your name.

My only way of identifying people is by the sound of their voice.
With nearly two thousand people to talk to, it is difficult to associate
the right name with the right voice. After I have talked to people
a number of times, I get to know their voices and the name which
goes with them and can usually mention the name when we meet.

My home is now in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, a small town outside
of Philadelphia. We have just recently moved there. Before that
time I lived in North Philadelphia. I received all my education be-
fore coming to Bucknell at the Overbrook School for the Blind in
West Philadelphia.

At Overbrook I received an education equivalent to that which
one would receive in any good high school. In addition to academic
work, I received generous training in various handcrafts, pottery,
basketry, wood work, machine shop, and canning.

At Overbrook it is made certain that each student is given all the
training in all the fields for which he shows any ability. This na-
turally enables him to have more opportunities to make a living after
graduation. Oh, by the way, I even took a course in cooking and so
would be able to take care of myself as far as food is concerned.

Ever since I can remember, I have always wanted to attend col-
lege after I graduated from Overbrook. Naturally at a school for
the Blind like Overbrook, all the special equipment and books are
already there for us to use. There really isn’t any problem of learn-
ing at all. But when I entered Bucknell, the situation changed.

Many times during the last year people asked me how I was able
to do the work. So I will take the rest of the space in this article to
explain to you how I was able to do the work. In other articles I'll
take up other facts of my life which I feel would probably be of in-
terest to you.

The most important problem I had to face was that of getting the
books I would need put into a form which I could use.

Of three possible methods, the first is to have the book recorded
or: records called “Talking-Books”. For reading courses this I find
is the best way of having my books prepared. There are various
volunteer organizations to which I send the books I need recorded.

The second way is to have the book put into braille. To tell you
exactly what braille is would be rather an involved operation, and I
do not believe I could make myself clear as to how braille works just
by using the printed word. If you would like to know about braille,
ask me and I will gladly show you its operation.

There are not too many organizations which are equipped to do
brailling. Since braille is very bulky, it requires immense space to
store even one book. But braille is the best way to prepare a Math.
book. Unfortunately, I was not able to get my Math books brailled
last year and so had to rely on other books that were in braille and
on readers.

The third way of getting my books is just to have someone read
them to me. This naturally takes up a great deal of time, but it can
be very useful both to me and to the reader. No matter how many
books I can get recorded or brailled, there are always some which it
is just impossible to record within the time limit of a semester, and
therefore I must rely on some reader service. 4

Here is where I would like to call on some of you for assistance.
If any of you have a few hours a week to spare and would like to do
a good deed for the day, perhaps you would be able to read to me
now and then. Reading aloud is not the easiest job in the world and
naturally I do not expect you to be a perfect reader.

I have talked to many of my friends who also have gone to col-
lege, and they report that those who read to them have found it en-
joyable and at times even helpful, especially if they were taking the
same course as the person to whom they were reading. If you find
that working with another helps in the mastery of the subject, per-
haps you would find reading to me also helpful to you.

If you would like to be a reader, please either get in touch wtih
me at East College, or just stop me as you meet me on the way to
class. I certainly wotld appreciate any help any of you would be
willing to offer.

Now, you might be interested in what courses I will be taking
this year, and what is my major. My major is mathematics, and my
minor is political science.

Word of Advice
To BU. Frats

According to the new fraternity
scholarship regulations, passed by
the University of North Carolina’s
standing faculty committee on
fraternities and sororities, at least
;80 per cent of the actives must
jhave a “C” average by the end of
the fall semester of 1960.

The first failure to maintain
this standard will result in an of-
| ficial. reprimand and warning; the
second violation will result in loss
of rushing privileges in the fol-
lowing semester and until the
grades have been brought up to
the standard. The “C” average
is for each semester, not an ac-
cumulative average. The ‘“C”
average for initiation will be
maintained.

Work done by individuals dur-
ing summer school will have no
effect on the semesterly compu-
tation to determine if a fraternity
can meet the academic standards.

KCL Annual Picnic

Kappa Chi Lambda, an or-
ganization for those students
interested in Christian voca-
tions; will hold its annual pic-
nic at Cowan on October 1.

ested students will leave from

WILL NIXON OR KENNEDY BE

YOUR CHOICE IN NOVEMBER?

by Lynne Coffin

The most recent Gallup Poll,
published in the Washington Post
and Times Herald on Friday, Sep-
tember 28, shows that voters be-
tween the ages of 21 and 29 are
2-to-1 in favor of Kennedy over
Nixon. Why should we, the gen-
eration which will, in a short
while be leading the world, be
overwhelmingly for Kennedy and
the Democratic Party?

The Democratic Party has tra-
ditionally been the party of pro-
gress and reforms while the Re-
publicans have consistently been
more conservative and have tried
to maintain the “status quo.” To-
day, with the prestige of the
United States abroad at an al-
most all-time low, with public
welfare such as schools and
health-aid for the aged crying for
attention, and with two recessions
in four years and a third predict-
ed for this year, it seems natural
that we should want to change
the status quo. During the en-
suing weeks before November 8,
I shall try to briefly discuss sev-
eral of the numerous areas in
which the Democrats wish to
make improvements over the last
seven sterile and stultifying years
of Republican rule.

Democratic Spenders

A familiar criticism of the
Democratic Party, voiced by the
uneducated ever since the days of
the New Deal, has been that the
Democrats are spenders while the
Republicans, due to the prepond-
erance of business executives in
their ranks, are considered to be
fiscal experts. A brief review of
facts should clear up this miscon-
ception.

During the Truman years the
gross national.product (the over-
all measure of economic activity)
of these United States increased
on an average of 4.6% each year.
Yet, during the last seven years of
rule by the Republican “fiscal ex-
perts”, our economy has dragged
its feet with an increase of only
24% each year. This growth
rate, by the way, is slower than
that among our major industrial
countries during the same period
of time. This slowdown in our
national growth has meant a loss
of more than $250,000 billion in
production. Had the economy
expanded as it should have, the
Federal revenue would have had
$50 billion more to spend on im-
proving our national needs in ed-
ucation, health, and other public
services.

National Debt

Let us look next at the com-
parison of our national debt ac-
cumulated during Truman’s ad-
ministration with that of Eisen-
hower’s. During Eisenhower's
term, he increased the national
debt by $12% from 1954 to 1959
alone. He also ended up with a
deficit in the national accounts
during four of his six years in
office and is expected to end with
a deficit this year. By contrast,
Truman had a net surplus of $4
billion during the four years of
peace while he was in office.

Furthermore, when the Repub-
licans came to office in 1953, only
3% of the total labor force was
unemployed, yet by December of
1954, unemployment was up 5%
of the labor force. This unem-

ployment has hit those who are!

under 25, older workers, and
negroes. In other words, we are
the recipients of the slower labor
demand which has resulted from
the managing of our nation’s
fiscal policies by Republican “fis-
cal experts.”

Many of us going from college
into the “big, wide world’ plan
to live on our own incomes in-
stead of relying on Dad’s affluent
pocketbook for the rest of our
lives. Yet, will Republican in-
flationary economic practices help
us? No. During Eisenhower's
eight years, rents have, increased
on the average of 20%, gas and
electric rates have gone'up 19%,
solid fuel and fuel oils cost 16%
more than they did before Eisen-
hower came in; residual water
costs are 40% more, residential
telephones cost 10% more, and
household operations cost 23%
more. And yet, the national econ-
omy fails to expand accordingly.

Appointed to this position by
the chief of the theoretical divis-

ter’s work consisted mainly of
hypothesizing about the constitu-

are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune.

Using the 7090 IBM computer
to solve equations, he attempted
to explain their properties such
as mass, moments of inertia, and
oblateness.

Early results indicate that Jupi-

posed of solid hydrogen, while
Uranus and Neptune mainly con-

there another side to college life—the academic one?

Extra curricular activities are important. But some-
where the line must be drawn. Wednesday night the
Bucknell Student Forum presented a program on Germ
Warfare. The speaker, Marc G. Raskin was well qualified
to discuss the topic. The date of the program had been
registered since the beginning of the academic year. Yet
in spite of this fact, other non-academic activities were
planned that conflicted with the Forum Program.

If the University is concerned enough about the success
of its Homecoming Plans to close the week-end to other
activities that might conflict with them, it would be
thought that it would be equally concerned with the pre-
vention of conflicts with acdemic events. Or is it that
the social side of life at Bucknell has become more im-

portant than the academic side?

Although the majority of students do not enter college
with the expectation of making Dean’s List, the import-
ance of grades is recognized by all. Grades are of imme-
diate concern to the student, for to remain in school he
must maintain a certain average, and to participate in
certain activities this average must be higher still. Stu-
dents with top grades are eligible for Dean’s List and for
various honorary organizations. In the more distant fu-

ture, the individual’s grades and total average will have
a profound effect on his career, and thus his entire life.

No student, however, should choose his courses only in
terms of the grades he may expect from them. Grades
provide a fairly accurate measure of what an individual
has gained from a course in relation to the standards of
that course.

But it is a well-known fact that some courses possess
lower standards of achievement than others. By careful
selection in May and December, it is quite simple to reg-
ister for the low-numbered course, the easy professor, the
Q. C. course. In doing so, however, the student stands to
lose much more than he gains.

Difficult courses, challenging professors and honors sec-
tions offer rewards far more valuable than a high grade-
point average. For one thing, material in such courses is
presented in a searching and extensive manner, with a
resulting gain in concrete knowledge. More important,
however, is the intangible factor of the student’s personal
development.

It is only through challenge, through asking more of
himself than he hs done before, that the individual’s high-
est abilities may be realized. The student who is willing
to measure himself against standards more fundamental
than letter-grades will choose his courses on the basis of
the challenge they offer him, and will in all probability
discover that his abilities are equal to the challenge.

In spite of increased costs, which, in view of the rising costs to-

the handling of student expenditures. The catalogs illustrate this
sensible policy:

Born in Germany, Dr. Rescher |!ems. He has published regularly

“There s great hazard, in most cases, in allowing students
to have in their possession any considerable sums of money, un-
less they have been accustomed to it at home. Some person in
Lewisburg should be entrusted with the funds, expend it as re-
quired, and render exact accounts. Many a student has been
ruined at college for want of this precaution.”

In keeping with this policy several of the faculty members have
agreed to handle student funds for a fee of five per cent of money

WHAT TO DO TILL THE
PSYCHIATRIST COMES

Once upon a time at the University of Virginia there was a
coed named, oddly enough, Virginia University who was hand-
some and kindly and intelligent and ingeniously constructed
and majoring in psychology. Virginia went steady with a young
man on campus named, oddly enough, Oddly Enough who was
supple and fair and lithe and animated and majoring in phys ed.

Virginia and Oddly enjoyed a romance that was as idyllic as
a summer day, as placid as a millpond. Never did they fight—
never, never, never!—because Virginia, who was majoring in
psychology, did not believe in fighting. “Fighting,” she often
said, “‘settles nothing. The scientific way is to look calmly for

pose of this debate was to give!
the incoming freshmen and inter-
ested upperclassmen a greater in-
sight in the techniques of inter-
collegiate debating.

The topic selected for argumen-
tation this year is of timely inter-
est. A modified version of the
issue has been passed in the last
session of Congress. ' The debate
topic is: “Resolved: that we should
adopt a system of compulsory |
medical insurance for all citi-
zens.”

To date, the Society has receiv-
ed invitations to five major tour-
naments in the East. They in-
clude: Howard University, No-

also planning a debate tour of the
“Ivy Colleges” under the guid-}

As all can see this is an impres-

Youll he bald’ befor? Youre Zirly!

After six months of this sedate liaison, Oddly was so bored
he could spit. He loved Virginia well enough, but he also be-
lieved that people in love ought to fight now and then. “It
opens the pores,” he said. “And besides, it’s so much fun mak-
ing up afterwards.”

But Virginia would not be provoked into a quarrel. One night
Oddly tried very hard. “Hey,” he said to her, “your nose looks
like a banana, and your ears look like radar antenna, and your
face looks like a pan of worms.”

“My goodness, we’re hostile tonight!” said Virginia cheerfully
and whipped 120 Rorschach cards out of her reticule. “Come,”
she said, “let us examine your psychic apparatus.”

Oddly tried again. ‘‘You’re fat and dumb and disagreeable,”
he said, “and you'll be bald before you’re thirty.”

“Hmm,” said Virginia thoughtfully and lit a cigarette. “This
sounds like an anxiety neurosis with totemism, anagogic trauma,
and a belt in the back.”

“Thate you,” said Oddly. “I hate your looks and your clothes
and your toenails and your relatives and the cigarettes you
smoke.”

“Now, hold on, buster!” cried Virginia, her eyes crackling,
her color mounting, her nostrils aflame. “Just keep a civil
tongue in your stupid head when you talk about Marlboro!
Nobody’s knocking that filter, that flavor, that pack or flip-top
box while there’s breath in my body! It’s a full-flavored smoke,
it’s a doozy, it’s a dilly, it’s a gas—and anybody who says a
word against it gets this.”

By “this’’ Virginia meant a series of combinations to the
head and liver, which she now delivered to Oddly and turned
on her heel and stormed away.

Oddly brought her down with a flying tackle. “
with all my heart,” he said. \ eu aici

“And Marlboro?” said she.

“And Marlboro even more,” said he.

And they kissed and plaited love knots in one another’s hair
and were married at Whitsuntide and smoked happily ever after.

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1960.

Fans Strongly Root for Kennedy, Nixon

Qn Basis of Eisenhower Foreign Policy

by Lynne Coffin
I read with interest David

Baird’s remarks last week about |

Nixon’s experience which has
ostensibly prepared him for the
White House,
should best be able to tell us
about Mr. Nixon’s experience
seems to think differently, how-
ever.

In his press conference of Au-
gust 24, 1960, after insisting that
he makes all decisions himself,
Ike replied that he could not
think of a single major idea given
him by Nixon.

If, however, we can accept Mr.
Nixon’s assertions that he has
been very active in policy-making
in the Eisenhower administration,
what do we have to point to in
the field of foreign policy to be
proud of?

Today, our foreign policy is un-
certain and vague. In 1954, Ike
announced a policy of “massive
retaliation” to help the French
forces in Indo-China. However,
he failed to meet his promise and
Dien Bien fell to the Communists.
In the 1952 presidential campaign,
Ike pledged to encourage libera-
tion of countries behind the Iron
Curtain. In October of 1956, the
Hungarian people rosé up against
their oppressors hoping that
American support would come; it
did not, and Hungary fell back
into the Communist fold.

In 1956, our government offer-
ed to give economic and to help
build the Aswan Dam. When we
abruptly withdrew the offer, Nas- |
ser, to regain his prestige, seized
the Suez Canal and Communist
penetration of the Middle East!
continues. In Cuba, we support-
ed Batista until a few days before |
Castro took over, encouraging the
animosity of the Cuban govern-
ment which ousted the dictator |
Batista and .giving the Commun-
ists a head start in winning Cas-
tro’s approval.

During the past seven and a}
half years we have emphasized
military aid te underdeveloped
nations and decreased the eco-
nomic aid which they so desper- |
ately need to feed and clothe their |
populations. In 1958, Mr. Nixon
made his now famous trip to
Latin America. Warned in ad-
vance that the natives were not
friendly, he insisted egotistically |
upon going and “standing up to}
the Commies.” Again in May of
1960 the Eisenhower-Nixon team
showed its superb knowledge of
foreign affairs in the famous U-2
incident.

Senator John F. Kennedy and|
the Democratic Party offer posi-
tive suggestions to help our coun-
try regain its position of great-|
ness: continuous modernization of
armed forces through intensified
research and development, a com-
plete re-examination of the or-
ganization of our armed forces,
and balanced conventional mili- |
tary forces which will permit us
to meet threats of aggression in
the world. He further supports

The man who}!

| by David Baird

On July 27, 1960, the Repub-
lican National Convention adopt-
led the Republican platform for
| the ensuing four years. It is a
platform built around the recog-
nition of the Communist threat
and the need to maintain our na-
tion’s economic growth in face of
that threat. The United State’s
foreign policy and its economic
growth, a discussion of which will
jfollow next week, will probably
be the two main issues in the
Presidential campaign. With so

ticipating in the opening of the
General Assembly of the United

people of the United States to be-
come more conscious of our
foreign policy. Foreign policy
has be considered by Vice Presi-

Lodge as one of their major at-
tributes as candidates for office.
At the same time it has been
proper for the Democratic nom-
inees to be critical of the present
foreign policy.

Many people realize the import-
ance of foreign policy but not the
exact position to which the
United States has been elevated
in world leadership. Not only
are we the leading military power
of the Western nations, but we
are an important ideology leader.

We must regard the United States

Bucknell Food:
‘love it--Reinel

by Patty Brown

“Achtung,” and another Ger-
man class under the direction of
Marianne Reinel begins. But Miss
Reinel is a regular member of the
Bucknell faculty. She is a Ful-
bright scholar from Erlangen,
Germany, where she attended the
University of Erlangen.

An English and French major,
Marianne taught in a secondary
school for one year before coming
to Bucknell. This is not the first
time, however, that she has been
to America. In 1952 she was a
high school exchange student in
Green Bay, Wisconsin.

This time Marianne traveled
across the ocean on the North
German liner, Berlin, and had “a
wonderful trip”—“Ten days, old
boat, but lots of fun.” During
the last day of the trip, the
weather did not cooperate, for the
boat docked in New York in the
midst of Hurricane Donna, and
Miss Reinel’s first impression of
an American metropolis was “a
city without lights, without heat,
and without any electricity!”

When Miss Reinel arrived at
Bucknell she was impressed with
the beautiful campus. “German
students,” she said, “don’t live on
campus,so there isno campus life

ties.” She told me that the whole
atmosphere of the German Uni-
versity is devoted to more inde-
pendent study. For instance,
there are no formal classes; all
lectures and seminars are non-
compulsory; there is no roll call
and no attendance records are
kept.

I asked if there were fraterni-
ties and sororities. “Yes, there

are fraternities, but many univer- |

sities won’t permit them.” There
are no sororities. Where fraterni-
ties are allowed, they serve the
same purpose as do American
ones: residence hall, dining room,
jecture place, and party house.
“How does the food at Buckneli
strike you?”, I queried. “I love

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1960.

FROM THE SIDELINE

by Steve Skinner

Several sophomore members of the football team have distin-
guished themselves on several ‘occasions this year. Halfback Dick
Johnson was named the outstanding sophomore in the Gettysburg
game, and last weekend Dick Tyrrell snared six of “Turk” Terhes 14
passes. His effort must have aroused memories of the indomitable
Terhes to Eachus combination of a year ago. Center Dean Stump
has also received the praise of his fellow teammates as well as the
football fans.

* *
™

The Bison-Cornell game bore an odd resemblance to the Buck-
nell-Harvard contest last year. There was a considerable distance
between schools. Both times the Bisons traveled as slight underdogs,
according to the experts. Each time Bucknell returned they brought
with them the stigma of a defeat that never should have been. Na-
turally everyone feels that they “should have won,” so you can not
blame anybody for going back over each “If”. Last year’s team did
pull off two of the biggest upsets in small college football. This year
they had several opportunities to pull an “upset” over an “emaci-
ated” Cornell team, even though that squad stretched from one 20 to
the other. And so on speculation, ad infiinitum.

A crowd of about 10,000 people
were on hand at Schoellkopf
Field Saturday afternoon to see
the Big Red pound out 265 yards
rushing as compared to only 80
yards rushing for the Bisons. Al-
though the bigger Red line out-
played the Bison front wall,
there were times when Bucknell
really looked good. ‘One of the
brighter points came in the third
quarter when Cornell’s halfback
Pat Pennucci carried the ball in-
side the Bucknell six-yard line
for a first down. The determined
Bison line dug in and held, tak-
ing the ball after four Cornell
tries which all proved unsuccess-
ful. The Bucknell line also look-
ed good as they gave quarterback
Paul Terhes plenty of time to let
loose a total of 29 passes of which
14 were completed for a total of
130 yards.

Bucknell managed to draw first
blood after five and one half min-
utes had gone by in the second
quarter. Terhes led the Bisons

The University of Massachu-
setts Collegian sent a question-
naire this school’s way concern-
ing athletic scholarships. They |
inquired about Buckley’s scholar-
ship sports, our football record
over the past five years, whether
or not football is our major sport, |
and if we had any plans to build
Bucknell up to be one of the ma-
jor powers in the East. What
results they expect to obtain ap-
parently are in connection with
some incident that occurred at
Massachusetts over scholarships.
They’re taking a nationwide poll
and we'll publish the results as
fast as we get them.

Bucknell seems to be heading
along the same Bison trail of in-
juries, which plagued last year’s
squad. Tackle Denny Morgan is
hurt and so is Bill Urch. At first
report Morgan was to have been
out 2-4 weeks, but the latest hear-
say is that he’ll be ready for the
Rutgers game. Urch, Morgan,
and Don Chaump, all fraternity
brothers, will have the unwel-
come duty of keeping each other
company on the beach tomorrow
when Buffalo comes to town. The
team got a look at Buffalo when

Athletic Director Al Humphreys
has announced that the student
tickets for Bucknell’s game with

price, $1.50. If you wait until}
you get to New Brunswick, you'll
pay three ‘bills to see the Bisons
play. There is one stipulation.
When you buy your ticket you
have to sign to get it at half price.
No blocks of tickets will be sold.

Even though modern electronic computers work at al-
most unbelievable speeds, the scientist is way ahead

Put quite simply, scientists have been thinking up com-
plex problems faster than even the fastest computers
could handle them. To close this gap, IBM created
STRETCH, the world’s fastest, most powerful computer.

The first STRETCH system will go to the AEC at Los
Alamos to aid in nuclear reactor design. This goliath can
do a million additions or subtractions a second. It can
“read” the equivalent of four million characters per
minute from magnetic tape. It can print the equivalent
of three good-sized novels every hour. It can perform
all these operations simultaneously, and if necessary

pause midway in the problem and tackle a more im-

portant one.

Creating such tools and putting them to work for sci-
ence—or for business, industry, or government—is ex-
citing, important work. It calls for talents and skills of
every kind, from liberal arts to Boolean algebra to astro-

physics.
So whatever your particular

talents and skills, there

may be just the kind of job at IBM you've always wanted.
The IBM representative will be visiting your campus this

year. Why not ask him about

it? Your placement office

can make an appointment. For further information about

Big Problem

Big Problem: Finding adequate
tackle replacements for four start-
ing-calibre graduates. Solution
depends on development of sophs
and possible personnel shifts.

The Line: Fair size, adequate-
speed, real need for “experienc-
ed” depth.

The Backfield: Deep, experi-
enced, good speed, should shine.

Ground Offense: Good runners,

Ground Defense

Ground Defense: In ’59 Bulls
held opponents to 2.6 yards per
rushing play. More powerful op-
position and line development are
questions.

The Package: If the offensive

tion, there is plenty of work to be
done in the 14 days of double-
session drills. Starting Septem-

on the interior line assignments.

defensive rigidity that led to 8-1-0
records during the past two sea--

perhaps the nation. Their calls
will assign the untested linemen

their team mates and are proven
masters of defense analysis.

changes were made by Coach
Odell as a result of the injuries
incurred in last week’s game with
Cornell. Ashton Ditka, who was
named “Chuckles Ax-Murder” by |
the Quarterback Club of Lewis-
burg for his play at Cornell, will
play first string halfback and
second string fullback. Tom Note-

Does anyone want to jump out
of an airplane? This question
was asked a few weeks ago to
Bucknell students by Lt. Richard
Grabow of the ROTC Dept. The
response to the question was so
great that it resulted in a new
Bucknell Club which promises to
be the hottest thing on campus. !
The Parachute Club consists of 25 |
students with Lt. Grabow as the
faculty advsor and Alan Gardner
as the first president.

The objective of the club is tg
conduct parachuting activities on
weekends, and to select a team to
compete in the Spring intercol-
legiate parachuting matches to be
held against Cornell, Princeton,
West Point, Dartmouth, and U. of
Massachusetts. Sport parachuting
or “sky-diving” as it is common-
ly called, is a sport in which the
participant dives out of an air-
plane at a high altitude, stabilizes
and manages himself while he is
falling free, and then after a
period of time opens his para-
chute and steers it towards a

automatically open their para-
chutes after 3 seconds. Then they
will progress gradually up to de-
layed free-falls of 30 seconds. A
terminal velocity of 128 mph is
obtained after 12 seconds of free
fall.

The location of the parachuting
activities will be Saturdays at
Lewisburg Airport and Sundays
at Selinsgrove Airport. Since the
airplane costs are great for bring-
ing the jumpers up to the requir-
ed 2500 feet altitude, it is request-
ed that spectators make voluntary
contributions to help pay for the
airplane.

HERE! THE GREATEST

SIXTY-ONE

Here’s the car that reads you loud and
clear—the new-size, you-size 761 Chev-
rolet. We started out by trimming the
outside size a bit (to give you extra inches
of clearance for parking and maneuvering)
but inside we left you a full measure of
Chevy comfort. Door openings are as
much as 6 inches wider to give feet, knees,
and elbows the undisputed right of way.
And the new easy-chair seats are as much
as 14% higher—just right for seeing, just
right for sitting.

Once you've settled inside you'll have
high and wide praises for Chevrolet’s
spacious new dimensions (in the Sport
Coupes, for example, head room has been
upped as much as 2 inches, and there’s
more leg room, too—front and rear).
Chevy’s new trunk is something else that
will please you hugely—what with its
deep-well shape and bumper-level loading
it holds things you’ve never been able to
get-in a trunk before.

Yet, generously endowed as this car is
with spaciousness and clean-etched ele-
gance, it holds steadfastly to all the thrifty,
dependable virtues Chevrolet buyers have
come to take for granted. Your dealer’s
the man to see for all the details.

There’s never been a trunk like it before!
The floor’s recessed more than half a foot
and the loading height is as much as 10%
inches lower.

More space...
more spunk
and wagons, too!

Here’s the new Chevy Corvair for ’61 with
a complete line of complete thrift cars.

To start with, every Corvair has a budget-
pleasing price tag. And Corvair goes on
from there to save you even more. With
extra miles per gallon . . . quicker-than-
ever cold-start warmup so you start saving
sooner . . . a new extra-cost optional
heater that warms everyone evenly. Riding
along with this extra economy: more room
inside for you, more room up front for
your luggage (sedans and coupes have
almost 12% more usable trunk space).

And our new wagons? You'll love them—
think they’re the greatest thing for
families since houses. The Lakewood
Station Wagon does a man-sized job with
cargo, up to 68 cubic feet of it. The Green-
brier Sports Wagon you’re going to have
to see—it gives you up to 175.5 cubic
feet of space for you and your things.

Corvair’s whole thrifty lineup gets its pep
from a spunkier 145-cu.-in. air-cooled rear
engine. Same rear-engine traction, same
smooth 4-wheel independent-suspension
ride. See the polished and refined 1961
Corvair first chance you get at your
Chevrolet dealer’s.

Spare tire is in the rear in coupes and
sedans—leaving more luggage space up
front.

Even middle-seat passengers sit pretty,
thanks to Corvair’s practically flat floor.

Now in production—the GREENBRIER
SPORTS WAGON with up
to twice as much room as
ordinary wagons (third seat
optional at extra cost).

Forum Presentation
Not Specific Enough

Several questions remain in the
minds of those who attended the
opening meeting of the Bucknell
Student Forum, Wednesday eve-
ning, at which time Marc G. Ras-
kin discussed Germ Warfare. Mr. |
Raskin, legislative assistant to}
several United States Congress-
men, is well qualified to discuss
the subject, but unfortunately did
not present what many Bucknell-
ians had expected to hear.

Mr. Raskin opened his discus-
sion hy considering the historical
background of germ warfare in}
the United ‘States. A proclama- |
tion ‘was made by President
Roosevelt in 1943 which stated |
that ‘under no_ circumstances |
would the United States use}
poisonous gas first, but that we)
would reply in kind if other}
powers made the first move. |

“A-major question under consid- |
eration in Congress, and one
which we should consider indi-
vidually, is: Should we at this |
time reaffirm Pres. Roosevelt’s |
proclamation? |

Unfortunately, the audience
was not given sufficient informa.
tion to formulate an answer t
the question. |

The speaker discussed a group |
which he called “our second class |
citizens of defense,” the Chemical |
Corporation. Very little was ac- |
tually revealed except that this)
group is responsible for basic re-
search and development. |

Many problems accompany the |
use of chemical and biological |
weapons. Control is very difficult

mees for inspection are
almost nil. Production of the
materials in question does not re- |
quire extreme skill. “Germs can}
be made in anyone’s basement.” {

Another serious threat is “Gun {
runner” organizations that sell
the dangerous commodities to
small countrie: Raskin raised |
another question: If other coun-
tries have acc to these means,
should we tie our hands and make |
statements limiting ourselves to
certain types of “brutalization?”
If the Soviet is developing germ
warfare, shouldn’t we?

Public reaction is of utmost
importance in considering a sub-
ject so vital to national security.
People have a moral repulsion
to the idea of mass annihilation
by chemical means. The Chemi-
eal Corporé wants “to lift the

ARMY BIOLOGIST
LECTURES HERE

Dr. Charles G. Wilbur, chief of
the Experimental Zoology Branch,

and Development Laboratories,
will visit the campus next week
to present a series of five lectures
for the benefit of faculty, students
and area residents.

Appearing under the auspices
of the American Institute of Bio-
logical Sciences, Dr. Wilbur’s first
lecture will take place Tuesday
evening, October 18, at 7:30 p. m.
in the University’s Spotts Audi-
torium, when he will discuss
“What Biologists Do for a Liv-
ing.” Although the talk is pri-
marily designed to better acquaint
freshmen biology students with
the career opportunities found in
the biological sciences, it will also
prove to be an interesting topic
for those who want to learn mofe
about this field.

Returning to Spotts Auditorium
Wednesday at 10 a. m., Dr. Wil-
bur will address a class in bac-
teriology on “Biological Warfare,’
a subject on which he is excep-
tionally well qualified to speak.
For his Wednesday evening lec-
ture in the Coleman Hall Theatre,
Dr. Wilbur has selected Darwin,
The Man as He Was, as his topic.
The lecture, which was originally
given at a symposium for the
Darwin centennial last year, will
be presented-at 8 p. m.

Two illustrated lectures will be
featured by Dr. Wilbur on Thurs-
day, October 20. Temperature

What Price Principle?

On Friday night, October 7, the underlying principle of
American Democracy was denied by a man who is a can-
didate for the office of President of the United States.

In the second of a series of televised debates Richard °

Nixon, Vice-President of the United States, denied the
principle upon which America is built.

The Vice-President was discussing the question of the
defense of the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. In his dis-
cussion he pointed out that, “the real-estate is unimport-
ant, it isn’t the few people who live on them, they are not
too important. It’s the principle involved.”

What principle was the Vice-President referring to?
One is hard pressed to think of any principle which super:
cedes the welfare of human beings. The dignity of the
individual is what is upheld in a democracy. Yet the
Vice-President doesn’t think that the people on Quemoy
and Matsu are worth our concern. The Bucknellian does
not wish to be identified with either of the major parties.
However, Mr. Nixan’s statement is equally offensive to
Republicans and Democrats alike.

One of the problems with which the viewer of the de-
bate was confronted was trying to decide which of the
candidates was telling the truth. On several occasions
there were direct contradictions in the statements made
by the two men. One can only conclude that one of the
individuals, Mr. Kennedy or Mr. Nixon was presenting a
distorted image of the truth. An interesting aspect was
Mr. Nixon’s appeal to the voters to forget party labels and
vote for the man. We think that it is a little difficult to
do so. The national conventions drafted platforms for
their respective candidates to run upon. We don’t think
it is possible to do such a thing. The candidate and his
party are inseparable in their aims and methods.

Lest we be accused of favoritism let us turn the spot-
light to Senator Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy’s glaring fault
was his refusal to address the civil rights question direct-
ly. He was speaking after Vice-President Nixon had re-
sponded to.a question inquiring about his civil rights pro-
grams. Mr. Nixon gave no program but simply stated
those issues he felt to be important. This was an excel-
lent opportunity for Senator Kennedy to give some con-
erete answers concerning his program. However, all he
did was state a different set of jssues. There can be little
doubt that both men are trying very hard to keep the
southern voter from alienation. Nevertheless what is po-
litically expedient is not always morally right. A man
who aspires to the office of President of these United
States should not be afraid to speak out for equality and
the democratic principles for which so many have died.

It is indeed a disgrace when seventy-five percent of the
eountry is subjugated to twenty-five percent as in the case
of the civil rights questions. Both men should feel asham-
ed of themselves for their ack of courage.

The televised sessions are probably one of the most
publicly beneficial devices to come out of the political
camps in many years. The people have a chance to see
the candidates under fire, and in this way see them in a
much clearer light than is given off from a prepared
speech. We see the debates as a good thing, our only re-
gret is what we have seen and heard from both men. Let
us all take ourselves a little more. seriously and perhaps
create men who are not afraid.

Quality al Quantity

The concept of a university is one of research and schol-
arly insight. Unfortunately most undergraduates are not
equipped to supply either of these commodities to the
university scene. It is for this reason that we feel that
Bucknell should make a greater effort to expand her grad-
uate program. Granted that a fine graduate program does
exist, however, it could always be a little better. The re-
cent Dual Development Fund Drive did not list increased
research facilities as one of its objectives. We feel that
this was an error. At the present time there are only five
fellowships open to graduate students who are not grad-
uates of Bucknell.

Certainly new buildings are important, but there can
be no substitute for bringing more minds to bear on the
present problems facing the American Society. While
the undergraduate is the base of the university, the grad-
uate student is the tower which enables the school to
stretch upwards. ‘ Unfortunately many graduate students
at Bucknell find themselves in classes with undergrad-
uates. This is unfair to one or the other depending on
how the class is conducted. We feel that Bucknell should
and can put forth a greater effart to increase the quality
and quantity of her graduate program.

Ode to the ROTC

Did you ever write a paper
When the herd came marching by
And the army counted up to four
’Neath a bright October sky?

When traffic backed up several blocks
For future armed force boys,

As they shouted every afternoon

Of ROTC and its joys?

Tell me, could they find another byway
To ply their measured beat,

That the Sem might have one afternoon
Without those marching feet?

Imagine what parents’ weekends do to my schedule—

First, there’s the housing problem:

And how about my cultural development?
Why, all weekend you Bucknellians were out with
your parents.
How do you expect me to keep up on “Who’s dating
who?” and what are
Elvis Presley’s latest hits?
And I know already from listening to you
That the books you leave aren’t worth reading—that’s work!
But I must say, the food was much improved—
for this I do thank you parents.

And with changing the table cloths almost every meal,
I had a whole banquet to look forward to while

Find several rooms empty for myself and my friends.
But this weekend—good grief!
And all of those fur coats—brrrr.

look pretty on some lady’s back).
All in all this weekend has been
What your psych. professors call

Graduate Opportunities Include
FellowshipsandForeign Seminars

An election campaign, promis-
ing rich rewards to the successful
candidates, is under way as thou-
sands of faculty members from
universities and colleges in the
United States and Canada begin
to nominate college seniors for
Woodrow Wilson and Danforth
graduate fellowships.

Designed to reduce a nation-
wide shortage of qualified college
teachers, these two programs,
combined annually, award more
than 1,000 fellowships for first-
year graduate study at any uni-
versity. Candidates are elected
only after rigorous screening and
personal interviews. Upon elec-
tion, each candidate receives a
$1,500 stipend for living expenses
plus full tuition and family al-
lowances.

These programs are open to|

college graduates mainly in the
humanities, social and biological
sciences. All candidates must be
nominated by a faculty member.

‘THOME SWEET HOMECOMING”

A great number of people have been asking me lately, ‘‘What
is Homecoming?” but I have been so busy trying to find out
why my new sports car leaks that I haven’t had time to answer.
I am now pleased to report that I finally discovered why my
sports car leaks—I have been driving it upside down—and so
T am ready today to turn my attention to Homecoming.

Let’s begin with definitions.

Homecoming is a weekend when

old grads return to their alma maters to watch a football game,
visit old classrooms and dormitories and inspect each other’s

bald spots.

The weekend is marked by the singing of old songs, the slap-
ping of old backs and the frequent exchange of such greetings
as “Harry, you old polecat!”
or “Harry, you old rooster!” or “Harry, you old wombat!”
As you can see, all old grads are named Harry.

It is not just old grads who behave with such liveliness during
Homecoming; the faculty also comports itself with unaccus-
tomed animation. Teachers laugh and smile and pound backs
and keep shouting ‘‘Harry, you old Airedale
behavior is carried on in the hope that old grads, in a transport
of bonhomie will endow a new geology building.

The old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time
on Saturday their backs are so sore, their eyeballs so eroded,
their extremities so frayed, that it is impossible to get a kind
word out of them, much less a new geology building.

Even the football game does not improve their tempers.
“Hmmph!” they snort as the home team completes a 101-yard
march to a touchdown. “Do you call that football? Why, back
in my day, they’d have been over on the first down! By
George, football was football in those days—not this namby-
pamby girls’ game that passes for football today! Take a look
at that bench—50 substitutes sitting there. Why, in my day,
there were 11 men on a team and that was it. When you broke
a leg, they slapped a piece of tape on it and you went right back
in. Why, I remember the big game against State. Harry Siga-
foos, our star quarterback, was killed in the third quarter. 1
mean, he was pronounced dead. But did that stop old Harry?
Not on your tintype! Back in he went and kicked the winning
drop kick in the last four seconds of play, dead as he was. Back
in my day, they played football, by George!”

Everything, say the old grads, was better back in their day—
everything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the
old grads has to admit that back in his day they never had a
smoke like Marlboro—never a cigarette with such a lot to like
—never a filter so easy drawing, a flavor so mild yet hearty, so
abundant, so bountiful—never a choice of flip-top box or soft

So old grads, young grads, and undergrads, why don’t you

settle back and have a full-flavored smoke? Try Marlboro, the

be filled with the murmur of wings and no man’s hand will be

raised against you.

Clothes-Dryer Riding
Latest Campus Fad

by Patty Brown

“Come, Josephine, in my wash-
ing machine.” |

Last year it was telephone- |
booth-packing; this year it is
clothes-dryer-riding. Yes, that’s
right, dryer-riding. Seems that!
quite a few of the fellows around
campus have been indulging in
this recreation.

The basic skills of dryer-riding |
consist of the following:

1. Open door of dryer.

2. Insert one person—head fac-
ing outwards, feet braced on top.

3. Keep door open.

4. Insert dime.

5. Push button (usually con-
trolled by door) with hand.

Comments from experienced
dryer-riders range from, “There's |

nothing like a five-speed May-}
tag!” to “Ten cents for ten min-
utes; it’s better than coca cola!”

This activity is gaining national
popularity in a round-about way.
The dryer-riders even have an}
anthem which they sing while
whirling:

“I’ve been a dryer-rider _ for

many a year,

I spend all my money on whis- | >
key and beer. |

We'll go to the laundermat, just
me and you, |
We'll ride the washer and the |
dryer too.” |
One of Bucknell’s charter mem-
bers received a letter from a
friend at Fairfield University that
sums up the aspirations of the
dryer-riders: “The movement will |
not be asuccess until every dryer
has a sign, NO RIDERS.” |

Van Cliburn Captures Campus Audience

by Ann Rutledge {
Last Wednesday evening the
Bucknell Artist Series opened its
1960-61 season by presenting Van
Cliburn, winner of the American
Leventritt. Award and Russian
Tschaikovsky Competition. The
performance was one of the most
exciting ever presented on this
campus. }
Mr. Cliburn surprised the audi-
ence at\the onset with a pianisti+
cally-styled rendition of the Star
Spangled Banner. Many felt that
this competition was out of place,
not worthy of the artist. It re-
flects, however, the young pian-
ist’s great love and respect for
this country, unusual in these
hard-bitten modern times.
Three Sonatas
The first section of the regular
program was Franz Liszt’s Son-
ata in B minor, played in observ-
ance of the 150th Anniversary of
the composer’s birth. This partic-
ular sonata is regarded as the
acme of Liszt’s piano music, and
as Mr. Cliburn said, the height of

Gay Brook ’63, of Glastonbury,
Conn., was one of more than 700
delegates who met during the
summer at Stephens College, Co-
lumbia, Missouri, to confirm the
merger of four denominational
campus organizations into the
United Campus Christian Fellow-
ship. Gay, who is on the con-
tinuing committee of the Middle
Atlantic Region for UCCF, is also
program and worship chairman
of the UCC Fellowship at Buck-
nell.

After several years of study
and negotiation, delegates from
all parts of the country required
only a few minutes at a uniting
assembly to merge student groups
from the Disciples of Christ, the
Evangelical United Brethren
Church, the United Church of
Christ and The United Presbyter-

ion, one of the two best sonata
compositions of American 20th
century music. The ‘other he

As Mr. Cliburn said after the per-

about a lay audience’s reaction to
the contemporary work. But in

The Sidelines

‘by Steve Skinner

How does it feél to be the coach of a team that has just beaten
a favored opponent 41-0? “Great, terrific, wonderful,” were just a
few of the expletives Coach Bob Odell could voice after his team had
shellacked «a favored Buffalo squad by the score above. Surrounded
by a group of well-wishers in the locker’room after the contest, it
was obvious that Odell was filled with the pride and feelig that only
a coach can ‘know.

When questioned about the reasons for his team’s explosive play
in. the second half, he replied with, “I felt we could hurt Buffalo by
moving the ball outside. We had a great deal of success outside,
which threw the Buffalo defense off when we started to run inside.
Td say the outside running was the key to our victory.” Odell also
said, “We really needed that victory.” “After the show at Cornell
last weekend, this game gave all the boys a chance to play and re-
store confiden¢e to the team in general.” When queried about the
outstanding defensive play by the Bisons, which caused three fumbles
and a blocked punt, a typical Odell answer was given. “We'll take
them.”

* 8 * #

The coach was obviously pleased with the play of several of the
“lesser lights” on his squad. To every one who offered congratula-
tions, Odell grabbed them by the arm and pointed to a corner in the
locker room. “Did you see that Elliot? He threw a ball sidearm,
going the wrong direction, for a touchdown.

The officidls weren’t exactly top drawer the whole time last!
weekend. On one play Bucknell really crossed themselves up and|
everyone went whichway before the ball was snapped. Turk faded}
back to pass, ‘but everyone was so confused, including Buffalo, that|
they just stood around. Finally a Buffalo lineman charged Terhes. |
At the same time an official blew his whistle, signifying that play had |
stopped. The lineman kept on charging and Turk put the stands eal
hysterics by holding off the aggressor by grabbing a hold of his face
guard and leading him around like a bull with a ring in his nose. |
The ref had no prerogative to stop the play as Buffalo could have de-}
clined the ensuing ‘illegal procedure penalty and thrown Bucknell}
for a real loss. |

Tom Noteware pulled a little slight of hand when he stole aj
fumble from a Bull lineman. From the sidelines it was obvious the|
Buffalo player got to the ball first, but when the smoke cleared the
Bisons were on another ‘touchdown drive. |

In the fourth quarter when Odell cleared the bench, second year
man Doug Williams was ealled upon to direct the Bisons up the field.
On his second play from scrimmage he bobbled the ball as sopho-
mores will, but on the next down he played the part of a pro when
he lofted a flat pass to Marty Pope good for 25 yards. At the other
end of the field soph Williams discovered that he had engineered the|

'Soccer Team

Defeated, 4-1

Hank Peters’ varsity soccer
team was defeated by a hustling
Navy team 4-1 on the victor’s field
last Saturday. The game was by
no means an easy win for the
Midshipmen.

Navy opened the scoring early
in the first quarter on a looping
35 yard shot by their inside left.
The ball slipped between the
crossbars and the outstretched
arms of injured goalie Howie
Levine. Navy kept the pressure
on, and five minutes later they
scored when a ‘mixup occured in
the Bison backfield.

After Navy’s second goal, Steve
Conger replaced Howie Levine in
the goal because the latter had
trouble moving with his injured
back. With Conger moving very
well in the goal and the backfield
oriented to their assignments, the
Bisons withstood all of Navy’s
attacks for the remainder of the
first quarter and throughout the
second quarter. Bucknell’s for-
ward line missed several scoring
| opportunities in the second quar-
ter which would have knotted the
score.

The third quarter was a see-
saw battle which saw both teams
miss scoring opportunities. In
ithe fourth quarter Navy scored
twice on the only two good shots
they had all afternoon. With the
score 4-0 and with only a little
over one minute left, Lyman Ott
took a beautiful lead pass from
Bob Schad, eluded the two men
covering him, and caught the far
corner for the Bisons only score

BUCKNELL HUMILIATES BUFFALO 41-0

by John Minsker

Putting on a sensational second
half exhibition, the Bucknell
footballers made Parents’ Day a
glorious one by trampling the
University of Buffalo by the score
of 41-0 before 8,000 jubiliant on-
lookers at Memorial Stadium on
Saturday.

The partisan Bison crowd could
not believe their eyes as their
chargers streaked to five quick
touchdowns in the second stanza
at the expense of the pre-game
favorites from New York. The
second half exploison was quite
spectacular as the score at half-
time was only 7-0, Bucknell hav-
ing scored in the closing minutes.
A roll out pass from Turk Terhes
to Dick Tyrrell, covering 17
yards, produced the first score.
Ron Maslanik’s point after touch-
down was perfect. The six-point-
er climaxed a drive of 67 yards,
in which pitching Turk completed
three passes for long gainers and
Ash Ditka turned in some heavy
groundwork.

The first half saw the ball
change hands 10 times, as neither
team could sustain a drive. Joe
Oliverio, quarterback for the
Buffalo Bulls, led his team to the
BU nine yard line with a series
of screen passes early in the first
quarter, but that was as far as
they could go. In fact, that was
the closest the Bulls came to pay-
dirt all afternoon. Tom Alexan-
der and Dick Johnson made nu-
merous key tackles for the Orange
and blue in the defense-dominant
first half.

The last half was a completely.
different story as the BU eleven
took advantage of mistake after
mistake by the visitors while
rolling up three TD’s in the third
stanza and two in the finale.

After kicking off to start the
third period, the Bisons, in the
person of Tom Alexander, recov-
ered a Buffalo fumble on the 50
yard line. Captain Mickey Mel-
berger, ran 23 yards, and after an
incomplete pass and an eight yard
jaunt by Ash Ditka, Terhes skirt-
ed right end on an option play
and went into the end zone stand-
ing up. The Bisons led 14-0.

Not to be outdone by his run- |
ning mate at quarterback, Rick }
Elliot led Bucknell to its second |
TD of the quarter. Elliot set up|
the touchdown by running the}
right side—just as Terhes had |
done—for 28 yards to the one|
yard line. Two plays later he|
sneaked over from the three. ;
Earlier, Tom Noteware set up the |
drive by recovering a fumble on
the Bulls 32 yard line. Less than
three minutes elapsed before the |
Bucks hit the scoreboard again. |

stripe. “BU was penalized back |
to the 32 before they started roll-
ing. On the second play from |
that point, Elliott, still Legon
his team, threw a perfect aerial
to Dick Johnson in the end zone
for the tally. The score at the
end of the third period was 28-0. |

The final period was equally
enjoyable for BU rooters as the |
third quarter was. Ron Maslanik
started the ball rolling by block-
ing an Oliverio punt on the New
Yorker’s 26 yard stripe. Ken
Twiford bulled for a single yard
and two plays later he slipped
through the opponents defense on
a draw play for 16 yards and a
score. Faking a kick, Terhes went
for a two-pointer after the touch-
down, by throwing a pass to Twi-
ford, who made a spectacular div-
ing catch in the end zone. An
off-sides penalty nullified this
play but Maslanik promptly boot-
ed the PAT from five yards far-|
ther back.

Doug Williams, third Bison
quarterback of the day, continued
the scoring parade by engineer-
ing a drive totalling 92 yards.
Starting on his own eight, the
sophomore signal-caller led his
troops through 12 quick plays
climaxed by an eight yard toss to
Marty Pope for the final six-
pointer of the day. Looking like
a veteran, Williams ran for 12
yards and completed three oout
of three passes for 58 more. Pope
hauled in two of the aerials, in-
cluding the scoring toss while Pat
Malone, a junior end, made a
spectacular grab between two de-
fenders.

Fraternities, Frosh in Fall Sports

by Pete Cowman

The Bucknell 1960 intramural |
season is now in full swing with
teams formed fromthe various
fraternities and freshmen dorms
vying for top honors.

Each dorm and fraternity will
compete in soccer, handball, ten-
nis, and cross-country during the
fall season.

The soccer program is well on
its way, with two fraternity
leagues and a freshman league.

beyond the ends. The Bisons also
use an unbalanced line with a T
quarterback, but the ends are
split with! the halfbacks situated
between the ends and the tackles.

The two teams are not only
similar in that their offesive
alignments are alike, but also in
that both teams use two units in-

terchangeably. Coach Odell feels |

that the use of two units has
helped the Bisons more than any
other thing this season. “The op-
ponents,” he claims, “can’t afford
to relax when another team comes
in because the second team is not
second-string.”
Outstanding Defense

Both Rutgers and Bucknell
have been outstanding on de-

credited Nixon with always pro-

other advisory meetings. Eisen-

the state as befits his position.

Chicago on September 29, Presi-

Library Adopts
Overdue Policy

The library has recently adopt-
ed a new method of notifying stu-
dents of overdue books. Instead
of issuing notices every day, the
overdue notices will be sent only
once a week. Every Thursday
morning, slips will leave the li-
brary, regardless of when the
books were due.

The hours of the library are
similar to those of last year. Dur-
ing the week, the library is open

| from 8 a. m. to 10 p. m.; Saturday,

from 8 a. m. to 5 p. m.; and on
Sunday from 2 p. m. to 5 p. m.
and then again from 7 p. m. to 10
p.m.

However, assistance on research
work will not be available on
Sunday, although students may
still have access to reserve books
at the front desk. Research work
should be planned in advance so
that necessary assistance can be
obtained during the week when
the full staff is available.

What, Me Campaign?

On Tuesday, Oct: 18, a man who is a candidate for the
office of Vice-President of the United States delivered a
speech from the steps of the courthouse in downtown
Lewisburg. Granted that this was far from a major po-
litical address, none-the-less it was important. The lack
of student interest cannot be wholly attributed to the
party to which this man belongs. There is almost little
or no student interest in the election. There is a Demo-
cratic student group, but their organization is due more
to the efforts of the faculty advisor than any student con-
cern.

All we wish to say at this point is that we feel that it is
indeed unfortunate that the student body is so preoccu-
pied with trivia that it cannot get down and come to grips
with the issues of our time. Republican or Democrat, it
makes no difference. There should be an active interest
and concern on the parts of a group of college students.
No matter how many buildings we have, no matter how
many high school valedictorians make up the freshman
class, Bucknell will be a second rate school until it starts
accepting students who are not all from the same mold, a
very unfortunate one at that. This complete or near-
complete lack of student interest in a national election is
something for all of Bucknell to be ashamed of.

It is we, the students, who can change this situation.
We must look beyond the “Friendly 300,” and be ready
for what we see.

Parent. _-Why Bother?

The weekend of Oct. 7, was officially designated as
Parents’ Weekend. However, one is hard pressed to find
any justification for that designation. It certainly couldn’t
have been as a result of the appearance of the Dave Bru-
beck group, for this group is not universally accepted on
the college scene; therefore what possible reason could
there have been for the choice of a group which is one of
the most misunderstood and also one which is far from
popular with parents?

Everybody likes football games so we can find no quar-
rel there. Unfortunately, Saturday evening was the oc-
easion for the first annual Bucknell Parent’s Dance, an
affair which could conceivably be held only on centennial
years without making any substantial number of people
unhappy. The Bucknellian, while wholly in accord with |

L. Johnson Aims Speech Below Listeners,

Seeks Aid for Cuba Before Quemoy, Matsu

by Janet Powers
Stammering his way through
the first 20 minutes of a speech

directed to the lowest intellect
offered by the Republican com-
munity of Union County, Senator
| Lyndon B. Johnson addressed an
assortment of students, professors
and townspeople on Tuesday...
Although the half-hearted cheers
of even the Democrats, who had
waited patiently through an hour
of local candidate speeches, were
enough to take the starch out of
the stiffest candidate, the crowd
was not prepared for the unstuff-
ed shirt, who began his speech
with the fact that his grand-
parents on his mother’s side were
; Pennsylvanians.

Senator Johnson faced a unique
problem in the sharp division of
|the audience into two classes: the
educated elite and the unschooled.

Dear Editor,

Most people went to Hilltop last
Friday night with the idea that
they were going to see a silent
film classic, but they were dis-
appointed. There was no silence
at Hilltop that night. Every time
an actor or actress overacted,
howls of laughter came from
many members of the audience.

but this was mainly because the
actors had to express their emo-
tions without speech. This movie
{had its humorous moments, but it
}certainly was never meant to be

that the scheduled events be considered in light of the
fact that the weekend is designed for parents.

One reflection of Parents’ Weekend in and around Lew-
isburg is that all restaurant prices go up. We feel that
the students should protest this type of action on the part
of the various restauranters in the area. We hope that
next year, and ensuing years, will see a Parents’ Week-
end program designed with some thought to the parents.

Tribute to a Team

May we take this opportunity to commend the football
team for their efforts in last week’s game against Rutgers.
It was in our opinion, one of the greatest and most inspir-
ed performances ever staged by a Bucknell football team.

To all Bison supporters and especially the players and
eoaches, this praise is realistically little consolation, for
victory was so nearly in our grasp. We lost the game,
but won the praise of the press and of Bucknell and Rut-
gers supporters alike.

If ever a team deserved victory this one did, but even
without it, we are justly proud of the team who literally
played the game of its life. Congratulations, Bisons!

SFC to Assume

For Who’s Who Nominations

Because of dissatisfaction with
last year’s election of senior stu-
dents to Who’s Who Among Stu-
dents in American Universities
and Colleges, the method of elec-
tion has been changed this year.
Previously the election was
handled by a committee, headed
by the president of the senior

Who’s Who.

The responsibility for the elec-
tion has now been delegated to
the Student-Faculty Congress.
SFC will send notices to all cam-
pus organizations, giving them
the opportunity of suggesting out-
standing seniors. All students
who are suggested by the organ-
izations will be given a form to
complete, listing activities and
scholastic average.

Ballot Composed

A committee, numbering six to
10 members of the faculty, stu-
dent body and administration,
will screen the forms, placing ap-
proximately 50 people on the bal-
lot. This ballot will then be sent
to every senior in the university.
The seniors will return the ballots
to SFC for final tabulation. The
quota for Who’s Who this year is
from 28 to 32 students. Any sug-
gestion for improvement of the
method of election may be sent
to Joe Ciffolillo.

Procedure

The Board operates on a three
point foundation which may vary
with the needs of each case. The
Board discusses and deliberates
cases after receiving a statement
from the police, if involved; the
administration, if involved; and
the student. Members of the
Board often interview persons
directly or indirectly involved in
order to have as complete a story

tions of policy and ordinances student or faculty, party affilia-

tion, if any, and, of course, Presi-
dential’ choice. This information
will show trends from one class
to another, in each state, in the
student body as a whole and in
the faculty as a whole, whether
or not any one crosses party lines
and how the independent vote
goes.

NAME: John Hulse AGE: 27 MAJOR: Bus. Adm.
PRESENT JOB: Telephone Manager, Sioux City, Iowa

When John Hulse was a senior at the U. of

South Dakota, he

had his own set of “‘do’s’” and

“don’ts.”’ Don’t become a:mere cipher on some-
body’s payroll. Don’t sit on the shelf waiting for
your first taste of responsibility. Do get a job
where you have a chance to show your stuff
right from the start. Do the job.

John knew his B.S. in Business Administra-
tion could lead him into almost any field. He
chose the telephone business and joined North-

western Bell.

One of his first assignments: streamlining oper-
ating procedures for the telephone offices of Iowa’s
five largest cities. In this work John showed
good judgment and sound organizing ability.

Today he is Telephone Manager of Sioux

City, Iowa.

Besides managing day-to-day operations,
helping plan tomorrow’s telephone growth is
an important part of John’s job. A typical ex-
ample is the work he does with the Sioux City
Industrial Development Association. In this role,
he’s the answer man on projecting, planning and

supplying the communications

needs of new in-

dustry. He’s shown above with Bob Sweeney,
manager of the Sioux City Chamber of Commerce.

“You must always be thinking of the future
in this business,” John says. “We have to stay
ahead. I think a man who has something to offer
this outfit won’t have a minute’s worry about

what it can do for him.”

Tf you're a capable guy—looking for an action‘
job with rapid rewards for the man who can handle
it—you'll want to visit your Placement Office for
literature and additional information.

management jobs the most vital, intel-
ligent, positive and imaginative men

a costly and not very satisfying one.

Cornell Disappointing

Against Cornell Coach Odell watched his team suffer under the
oppressive weight of penalties. Knowing that the coach would never
use the officiating as an excuse, it nonetheless left something to be
desired. Despite some outstanding individual performances, the BU

Bisons just couldn’t make the best of an “if” game.
Buffalo Was The Best

After the depressing show at Cornell, the day that every coach

dreams of became a reality for Odell as his proteges romped over a
favored Buffalo team, 41-0. The exhiliaration and feeling that such
a victory can inspire gave the coach and the players the confidence
and spirit that came within a hair of beating one of the best football
teams Bucknell has ever played, as reported by the scouts. The last

three minutes of the Rutgers game had to remind fans of the dream,

of ten days ago in Forbes Field.

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, .1960.-

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

BUCKNELL TRIMS
LAFAYETTE 5-2

The Bison soccer team’ swamp-
ed the Lafayette Leopards 5-2 on
the losers field last Friday. Poor
officiating hindered the Bison at-
tack as they were improperly
called off-sides on 19 occasions.

Dave Boger opened the scoring
for the Bisons when he deflected
a perfect corner-kick by Bill Dahl
with seven minutes gone in the
first period. Lafayette fought
back -and scored on a perfect
shot into the upper right hand
corner by their left inside. Thir-
ty seconds later outside right Bill
Dahl moved into the center to
take a pass from Lyman Ott and
scored to put the Bisons back into
the lead.

The Leopards knotted the score
when they capitalized on a mix-
up in the Bison backfield. With
two seconds remaining in the
quarter, Frank Famariss took a
lead pass from Lyman Ott and hit
the nets to gve the Bisons the
lead at halftime.

The Bisons lone score in the
third quarter came when Frank
Lineaweaver pounced on a loose
ball on Lafayette’s 18 yard line
and scored. For the rest of the
third quarter and for most of the
fourth, the Bisons were hindered
more by the poor officiating than
the Leopards. However, with 40

seconds left in the game Lyman}

Ott remedied the situation by
outmaneuvering most of the op-
position and found an open cor-
ner of the nets.

Frosh Football Team
Edged By G-Burg 14-13

by Rich Rittenberg

A touchdown and a pass good
for two extra points enabled the
Gettysburg frosh to defeat the
Bucknell Baby Bisons 14-13 last
Friday night. Bucknell frosh led
throughout the game but Gettys-
burg, never giving up, came on
strongly to score the winning
points with 50 seconds left.

Bob Furney kicked off for Get-
tysburg. Don Rodgers returned
the kickoff 14 yards to the Buck-
nell 40. Neither team moved well
in the opening minutes and, after
an exchange of punts, Bucknell
took over on the midfield stripe.

Rodgers ran around end for the
first down. On the next play
Gettysburg recovered a Bucknell
fumble on their own 27 yard line.
Joe Elliot, on the following play,
recovered a Gettysburg fumble on
the 16 yard line.

Runs by Matt Hart and Don
Rogers earned a first down. With
six minutes left in the quarter,
Al Siegfried took a _ pitchout
around right end for the first
score of the game. Siegfried
kicked the extra point and Buck-
nell led 7-0.

Gettysburg was again stopped
by the Bucknell defense and was
forced to punt. Bucknell took

er near midfield and rolled up
a first down on four running
plays. Don Rodgers then threw
a 40 yard touchdown pass to Matt
Hart. The try for the extra point

was wide and Bucknell led 13-0) chutes after four secon

at the end of the quarter.

The entire second quarter was
a battle of defense. Each team
was forced to punt three times in
this period. Good defense for
Bucknell was turned in by John
Thornton and Joe Elliot. At half-
time the score was still 13-0.

On the first play from scrim-
mage of the second half Bucknell
recovered a fumble on the Gettys-
burg 21. The Bisons could not
move the ball and, on fourth
down, attempted a field goal. The
kick was short and Gettysburg
took over. Gettysburg went no-
where and was forced to punt.
Bucknell took over on its own 48
yard line. Two running plays
picked up a first down.

At t point the game reached
its turning point. Al Siegfried
was forced to leave the game with
. broken ankle. After Siegfried’s
injury, Bucknell managed to get
only one first down and had dif-

movng the ball.

r+ another Bucknell punt,
Gettysburg took over on their
own seven yard line. Hoffman
ga Gettysburg some running
room, going around his own left
end for seven yards. A nice de-
fensive play by Larry Pollack,
Ben Dekker, and Jim Hicks fore-
ed the Bullets to punt. Buckneli
also was forced to punt and the
Bullets had the ball on their own
20 yard line.

On the second play, Lynn Hoff-
man, with a burst of speed, broke
into the open and ran 76 yards
around left end for a touchdown.
The kick was wide and the Bisons
led 13-6.-

The fourth quarter was all Get-
tysburg. They rolled up five first
iowns to none for the Bisons. Af-

Parachutes
Over Camp

The Parachute Club, a new and
unusual organization, has been
introduced this year to the Buck-
nell campus by Lt. Richard Gra-
bow of the ROTC department.
Twenty-seven daring and enthu-
siastic students have joined the
club. Alan Gardner was elected
as the club’s first president.

The club will conduct parachut-
ing activities Saturday afternoons
at the Lewisburg airport and on
Sundays at the airport in Selins-
grove. The organization will
select a team to compete in the
intercollegiate parachuting meets
held during the Spring. Bucknell
will compete against West Point,
Cornell, U. of Mtassachusetts,
Dartmouth and Princeton.

Just Jump Out

Jumping in competition, or
“Sky Diving” as it is called, is a
sport in which the participant
dives out of the plane and exe-
eutes c in manuevers while
falling free then after several

onds he opens his chute and
guides himself to a predetermin-
ed target om the ground.

All the club members have al-
ready made at least one jump.
For the first five jumps, all par-
ticipants must use the static lines
that automatically open the

ually, the members will make de-

Jumper Interviewed

Skip Jacobs, who has already
completed two jumps has been
kind enough to describe the feel-
ing that he received in parachut-
ing for the first time. “The thrill
of parachute jumping is one that
can not be experienced vicarious-
ly. It is an exhiliarating sensa-
tion. I knew that the first jump
was going to be the biggest thrill
or fhe wo experience of m
life. I must admit that I
terrified as I tumbled backwar
head over heels for those first few
seconds. However, after the re-
assuring jolt of the opening can-
opy, I took a grateful glance up-
ward at that beautiful silk, and
my confidence soared. At that
height (2000 feet) it appeared as
though I were suspended and not
descending at all. In a few fleet-
ing moments the sighteseeing was
over and I was deposited solidly
on the ground. With a feeling of
elation and a sigh of relief, I be-

gan dreaming of my next jump.”

GRADUATES ASSIST
VARSITY COACHES

by Jim Godshall

Four lettermen of last. year’s |

varsity football squad have re-
turned this year to give Coach
Bob Odell’s capable coaching staff
added depth.

The four lettermen of last year’s
varsity squad and this year’s
coaching staff are Bob Patzwall,
Doug Forsythe, Larry Mathias,
and George Moncilovich. The
assignments of these men deal
with their speciality on the grid-
iron.

Bob Patzwall, last year’s big,
|bruising tackle, received the as-
signment of assistant line coach
for the varsity squad, concen-
trating mainly on the tackle posi-
| tion. Bob is presently here at

“American girls are on the
whole more attractive than Eng-

lish girls, but a lot of the latter ©
are more on the ball—better con- |

versationalists.” This alert, con-
scious, critical attitude of the stu-
dents at the University of Edin-
burgh was one of the many facets
of his year in Scotland under the
Junior Year Abroad program
which impressed David Welsh.
David was also very enthusi-
astic about the program of studies
at the University. In the three
courses which he took for the
year, he had examinations only

at the ends of the three terms |

plus intermittent term papers [

With the fewer number of courses
than we take, with the continu- |
ance of them throughout the year, \
and with the absence of periodic- |
ally distracting tests, the student |
in Edinburgh is able to spend |
more time on his subjects and go}
far deeper into them. David,
found himself able to take even- |

|ings off to attend concerts, plays, |

lectures, or whatever interested |
him, and, if the occasion arose, he |
could make weekend trips about |
the British Isles. |

Student Debate Intensifies Hulley Sleuth
As National Election Nears UnearthsPoetry

by Lynne Coffin

Last week, Mr. Baird suggested
that the Democrats were being
inconsistent by criticizing the
Eisenhower Administration and
Republican record without criti-
cizing Eisenhower. This, it seems
to me, is a mistake too often made
by those who believe Nixon’s
glib remarks that you should vote
for the man and not the party.

In today’s complex govern-
ments, the President cannot be
expected to personally read each
and every report, document and
newspaper which is written on a
subject which he will consider.
He cannot even be expected to
know all of the facts about each
and every decision which he must
make.

Instead, the modern president
surrounds himself with advisors
and liaisons who decide, for the
most part, what information shall

that only through a free economy
will the United States maintain
maximum economic growth.

The Republican Platform states
it this way: “We therefore accord
high priority to vigorous econom-
ie growth and recognize that its
mainspring lies in the private
sector of the economy.” This
rejects the idea of “artificial
growth” found in increased fed-
eral spending with increased taxes

shail be presented to him.
Final Decisions
Therefore, the president is often
less responsible for the final de-
cisions than are his advisors and

cabinet. Although General Eisen- |

hower may have been well-mean-

ing, he seems often to have been |

misled in his decision-making by
advisors..

Nixon, a member of the Eisen-
hower “team,” will no doubt con-
tinue as Eisenhower did to fill his
cabinet with business men instead
of political experts.

Kennedy’s Experts

Who, however, will be the ex-
perts in the Democratic Party
who will surround Kennedy and
help him by editing and sum-
marizing information on import-
ant reports? In the position of
Secretary of State, Chester M.
Bowles, the Connecticut Con-
gressman and expert in the field
of foreign affairs, will probably
be the choice. If not, Adlai
Stevenson, Averill Harriman,

George Kennan, or Senator Ful-|}

Senator who has devoted himself

“Hulley House, mmm?!” (still

Well, it just so happens that
Hulley House has an old, histori-

edifice, I discovered that Hulfey

This was nothing earth-shatter-

Lower Depths. ,This will be one
of the few times the drama has
been produced outside of Russia.
The Lower Depths is a naturalist-
ic drama about life among the
lowest class of Russian people in
the early 1900’s. According to
Marv Kahan, director, its style of
naturalism makes it one of the
most challenging plays Cap and
Dagger has ever produced. It
will also be the most expensive
production Cap and Dagger has
ever staged.

artificiality of the heroic and ro-
mantic plays of the nineteenth
century. It was an insurgent

Like other naturalistic plays,
The Lower Depths strives to put
truth on the stage by showing
physiological and psychological
motivation, thus maintaining the
illusion of life. When you see
The Lower Depths, however, you
will find a touch of romanticism
still survives.

Appropriately, Gorky expresses
this romanticism through the
prostitute and the ineffectual per-
sonality of the actor. Although
The Lower Depths is concerned
with the lowest level of human-
ity, it is more sarcastic than mor-
bid and promises to be one of the
most interesting plays ever pro-
duced at Bucknell.

Publicity Policy

Publicity of decisions entails
problems with which the Board
intends to cope. It may be some-
time before a policy is settled,
but such action requires careful
thought. The Judicial Board does
not want to start a weekly “box-
score” of cases in the Bucknellian,
nor does it wish to punish an in-
dividual unduly by public notice.
When a reasonable policy is es-
tablished, it will be made known
to the student body.

Bucknell’s reputation depends |
upon the conduct of its students
wherever they may be. It takes
a long time to establish good re-
lations, but only one act of mis-
chief to destroy it. It is the re-
sponsibility of the entire student,
body to better these relations.

In the fall of last year Harvey.
Powers’ production of Ionesco’s
The Bald Soprano was presented
by Cap & Dagger at the Univer-
sity Theatre. Due to the critical
success of this show, The Actors’
Lab has decided to reveal Ionesco
in another guise.

This time the story involves a
professor and a pupil who exhaust
the learning process, at least its
rational implications. As in most
ionesco, a lack of communication
‘S created, this time between pro-
‘essor and pupil, and in the pro-
cess the masque is torn away
-rom conventional faculty-student
relations.

The “comic drama” features |
Christopher Newton as the pro-|
fessor, Violet Dunworth as the
pupil, and Kay Wilcox as the
maid.

Christopher Newton, the acting
instructor for the English depart-
ment this year, has acquired ex-
tensive acting and directing ex-
perience in England’s Leeds Uni-
versity, and as a graduate student
at the University of Illinois. His
most recent summer stock experi-
ence includes a season this past
summer at the Ashland Shake-
speare Festival. His most suc-
cessful role was that of Boling-
broke in Richard II.

Violet Dunworth, a freshman,
was president of the St. Luke’s
School dramatic gro in Hoho-
kus, N. J. A member of the Na-
tional Forensic’ League, she has
performed cuttings from JB, The
Glass Menagerie, and Beyond the
Horizon in state-wide competi
tion. During summers she has
been active as a writer, director,
and actress at Fire Island’s stu-
dent theatre project.

Kay Wilcox, a junior, has par-

| This past weekend several
|Prizes were awarded to groups
|participating in the Homecoming
| festivities.

Saturday morning, the annual
Homecoming parade was held, at
which time a group of judges se-
lected the most outstanding floats
and bands. First prize was
, awarded in the form of a trophy
to Theta Chi and Delta Zeta for
their float Good-Mourning Lafay-
ette. Kress Hall and Delta Delta
| Delta received a plaque for second
place for their novel idea Lick La-
fayette. A plaque was also award-
ed to Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
|Pi Beta Phi for their excellent
portrayal of Condemn the Cats.
Honorable mention went to Kap-
pa Delta Rho and Larison A for
Bison‘s Bar-B-Q.
| Some of the factors considered
|by the judges included original-
‘ity, group participation, and at-
jtractiveness. The awards for
jthese floats were made available
by the Lewisburg merchants.

Monetary awards were also
provided by the Lewisburg mer-
chants for the winning bands and
Plaques were awarded to each
visiting band. The awards for the
bands were as follows: first prize,
Central Dauphin, Harrisburg;
second prize, South Williamsport;
third prize, Bishop McDevitt,
Harrisburg; and honorable men-
tion was extended to Milton High
School.

Saturday night eight fraterni-
ties participated in the traditional
song contest. Although all of the
fraternities did an outstanding
job of rendering their respective
songs, Delta Upsion walked off
with the trophy for the second
consecutive year. This trophy
was presented by the Bucknell

Traditions Tried

This past weekend, Homecoming was observed with the
usual traditions which have characterized this campus for
nearly a half century. Students in sororities and fraterni-
ties stayed up all night stuffing paper napkins in chicken
wire in order to entertain the citizens of Lewisburg for an
hour the next day. Women in small dorms spent hours
of time stringing tin cans and painting spotted leopards
in competition for a prize.

This year, more than in others, a conflict was presented.
Six weeks grades reared an ugly head and leered at stu-
dents over the coffee cup and the cocktail glass. Expect-
ed, on the one hand, to produce the usual colorful decor-
ations for Homecoming, and on the other, to contribute to
their studies an extra amount of work, students gave the
worst half of their time to both.

Far from condemning the new academic approach
which has stiffened old courses and created challenging
new Honors sections, we raise the question of “The Old
Bucknell” versus the “New.” Floats were created this
year by a small nucleus of people, and the antagonism
against those “who didn’t have time to help” was bitter.
House decorations were hung with a maximum of grumb-
ling and a discouraging lack of spirit.

If this university is to concentrate on learning, and we
assume that that is its primary goal, perhaps the tradi-
tional Homecoming ectivities should be re-evaluated. It
would seem that the house decorations in the Sem could
be discarded without losing much sentiment or sleep. For
those traditionalists who wish to keep the parade, student
energy might better be divided between floats and studies
than between studies and a host of insignificant decora-
ions.

At the risk of being considered eggheads, we commend
the invasion of challenging young minds on the teaching
staff and the pulled-up bootstraps of what have been tra-
ditionally “Q. C. courses.” Isn’t it a shame that student
response to these innovations should be negligible during
the two weeks that “scholars” are preparing for and re-
covering from Homecoming?

Although better scheduling of Homecoming with the
barrage of tests preceding six-week grades is a partial so-
lution, the conflict between the “Old” and the “New”
Bucknell is yet to be resolved. As students, we cannot
consider ourselves members of a university and still damn
those who study in preference to stuffing paper napkins.

Everyone Can Vote

On Tuesday, November 1, Bucknellians will, we hope,
flock to the polls one week before the rest of the nation.
An election will be held on this campus in which all stu-
dents and faculty members may vote, regardless of age
or out-of-state residence. The purpose of the election is
to generate some genuine political enthusiasm on the part
of those unfortunately “set apart” from the excitement of
the American political scene.

Conceivably, the entire student body can support such
an endeavor by posting campaign signs and wearing cam-
paign buttons for Kennedy and Nixon. Those who cannot
vote in the national election may show their favor for the
party of their choice by taking the time to fill out a ballot
on Tuesday.

Coleman Hall will feature polling places manned by po-
litical science students. The results of the balloting will
be published in the Bucknellian and will offer valuable
information as to party affiliations of those attending this
particular university.

Mock conventions and mock elections have been a
source of enthusiasm and political concern on campuses
across the nation for years. The value of such an event
at Bucknell may only be measured by the support of those
who step out of their well-worn ruts to manifest an inter-
est in national affairs.

It is possible that the mock election will be a dismal
failure. If this happens, we may consider the student
body worse than dismal arid certainly a failure. If we
eall ourselves well-informed and consider ourselves citi-
zens of an enlightened country, we must accept the re-
sponsibility of voting.

EDITOR-IN-CHIEF—JANET POWERS

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

Dear Editor:

Generally the Bucknellian has

improved its coverage of the po-
litical life of our nation over that
of last year. Yet, several com-
j}ments about this coverage seem
| to be justified.
Last week, the Bucknellian saw
| fit to cover Johnson’s speech but
failed to even mention Lodge’s
speech the previous Saturday.
This oversight was especially ob-
| vous in view of the fact that the
coverage of Johnson was partisan
|and Republican. I can see the
| point in sending a critical report-
ler to cover a political rally, but
| why not give equal and similar
| coverage to both sides?

Further, I believe that your edi-
torial writer who wrote, “What,
Me Campaign,” was unfortunate-
|ly uninformed about student par-
ticipation in political activities

and the relative importance of
|faculty work. j

The “Students for Kennedy” or- |
| ganization, about which I amj{
‘more informed than about its Re- |
publican counterpart, is primarily
}a student-run organization. Last]
| spring a letter was posted on the}
| Political Science Department bul- |
 Jetin board asking for students to}
jwork en a “Students for Ken-'
'nedy” organization on campus.
Several of us responded and then ;
‘Sees to make tentative plans}
| for the fall. i

| I worked in the National Stu-
{dents For Kennedy Headquarters
{this summer and several others!
{worked at the local level. Dur-}
ing this time, more plans were
jmade for fall via letters to our}
|faculty advisor.

Several of these plans were not
carried out due to lack of cooper-
ation on the part of the adminis-
tration. For example, the “Stu-
dents for Kennedy” were not al-
lowed to set up a booth at the end |
| of the registration line.to find in- |
| terested Democrats or to give out
linformation on absentee voting.

However, students have taken
the initiative in several areas:

1. Students are manning the
“Citizens for Kennedy” office on
Market Street every day.

2. Students carried on a “Dol-
lars for Democratss” campaign in
Lewisburg.

3. Students distributed litera-
ture advertising Johnson’s ap-
pearance. ;

4. Students passed out informa-
jtion at the Parents’ Weekend
| game. -
5. Students attended a local
!Young Democrats for Kennedy
meeting in Williamsport to dis-
cuss local plans. 4

6. Students served as “Johnson
girls’ during the rally last week.

7. Students have taken the ini-
tiative in organizing a straw poll.

In addition to those who have
been able to give time to organiz-
ed work for the party, many are
working independently by dis-
| cussing politics with their friends.
Within my own party, we have
found that this method is one of
the most effective methods, al-
though not most obvious to the
casual observer.

I agree with your editor that
the political enthusiasm could be}
much better than it is.

REMEMBER

Every year, as we all know, the Benevolent and Protective
Order of Collegiate Fraternities awards a highly coveted prize

to the fraternity house which,
most to promote and enhance

in its judgment, has done the
the fraternity way of life. The

prize this year—eight hundred pounds of white putty —goes to
the Signa Phi Nothing chapter of the South Dakota College
of Dentistry and Renaissance Art.

The award this year is exceptionally richly deserved, for the
Signa Phi Nothing house is the very model of all a fraternity
should be. It is, first of all, a most attractive house physically.

The outside walls are tastefully

covered with sequins. Running

along the upper story is a widow’s walk, with a widow stationed
every three feet. Moored to the chimney pot is the Graf Zeppelin.

Indoors, the house gives an impression of simple, casual charm.
The chapter room is furnished in homey maple and chintz,
with a dash of verve provided by a carp pool three hundred feet

in diameter. A waterspout rises

from the center of the pool with

the housemother bouncing on the top.

Members’ rooms are gracious and airy and are provided with
beds which disappear into the wall—permanently. Each room
also has a desk, a comfortable chair, a good reading lamp, and
a catapult for skeetshooting. Kidney-shaped desks are avail-
able for kidney-shaped members.

Perhaps the most fetching feature of the house are the packs
of Marlboros stacked in heaps wherever one goes. If one wishes

Turk Does It Again

When a quarterback makes the All-East team for an outstanding
performance on a single Saturday. he is usually regarded as a good
football player. who had a good afteroon. But when that quarter-
back makes the All-East team two weeks in a row, that’s news. Paul
Terhes is news. After two seasons as the MAC’s top QB, Turk is
finally getting some proper recognition for the tremendous job he has
done for Bucknell. Turk was not only selected as the outstanding
quarterback in the East, but the Philadelphia sports writers are going
to honor him Monday, in Philadelphia, with the Maxwell Award,
given to the outstanding player in the area. A Harrisburg newspaper
is going to run a full page feature on Turk, including the story of his
life around Bucknell. Paul Terhes is earning a much deserved name
for himself and for Bucknell. :

The School of Hard Knocks

Much of the bone jarring defense that almost beat Rutgers be-
came apparent for Bison fans in the first three minutes of the game.
There were three fumbles, and in one series of plays Lafayette was
thrown for a loss three times before they were forced to punt. A
charging Bucknell lineman got a football in the teeth, but blocked a
quick-kick, which set up a Bucknell touchdown. Tom Alexander,
who has developed picking up loose footbails into an art, was forced
to leave the game in thé second quarter because he was plain old
tired. Alexander has been under the weather since before the Rut-
gers scrap and had been taking shots all week.

Ron “The Toe” Maslanik

Ron Maslanik has been called upon twice in two years to try for
three points. Each time he has responded and is now two for two in
field goals attempted. Both times he kicked them there were better
than 10,000 people in the stands. Inspiration? The Bisons seem to
do their best work before large home crowds. Before 18,000 fans in
two home contests they have decimated the opposition 69-0. Last
year, before a combined audience of 16,000 they pulled two of the
biggest upsets in small college football. Also among the kicking
oddities was the first onside kick seen at Bucknell for some time.
With only seconds remaining in the first half, Doug Willams fell ,on
a ball that went the required ten yards.

Lehigh Will Be Tough

When Lafayette came to town they sported a 3-0 record and a tie
for the Middle Atlantic Conference lead. It was a frustrated and
dispirited ball club that went away with a profound respect for the
explosive offense of the Bisons, the hard-hitting defense, and the
wonderful arm of Paul Terhes. This Saturday, a better football team
will take the field against Bucknell and each of the three components
mentioned above will be hard pressed to beat Lehigh. The Engineers
are a tough, experienced team, with a hefty line. Last. weekend they
lost to Rutgers 8-0, but you can’t compare scores when you're talking
about these three teams. “Lehigh had a chance to at least tie the
game when they pushed down to the Rutgers’s six. Their quarter-
back rolled out to his right and had nothing but daylight in front of
him, but elected to pass. The pass was intercepted in the end zone
and that was the ball game. Bucknell is going to have its hands full
tomorrow afternoon in what should be the best game of the season
for the home fans. ,

Easy Money
If you would like to make an easy three hundred dollars, there
is a contest going around school right now which offers that amount

score. The details of the contest have been listed in the sports sec-

tion of previous issues, and there several posters around school for,

anyone’s edification.

Soccer Team Wins
Third Victory 9-2

In routing Gettysburg 9-1 last
Friday, the Bucknell soccer team
set a new school scoring record
for one game. As the case has
been in the last two weeks, the
Bisons missed many easy oppor-
tunities to score which would
have placed the score in the
realm of the impossible.

The first goal was the hardest
for the Bisons. Gettysburg moved
the ball very well in Bucknell
territory for the first seven min-
utes. When the Bison’s backfield
finally dug the ball out, it was
just a matter of time before the
Bison’s scored. After missing five
or six shots, Dave Boger heeled a
corner kick past the Bullet’s
goalie. Bill Dahl added another
one a few minutes later when he
scored on a cross from Bob Wad-
hams. Just before the quarter
ended, Frank Famariss found the
nets on a cross from Lyman Ott.
| The Bisons kept the pressure
on, and Bob Schad scored one of
the prettiest goals of the season.
Bill Dahl headed a ball from the

just before it hit the ground into
the upper right-hand corner. Bill
Dahl banked one in off a full-
back’s legs to register his second
goal of the afternoon. Lyman
Ott ended the Bison scoring in the
third period on a hard shot from
15 yards out. The Bullets finally
got into the scoring column with
a shot from five yards out.

Bill Dahl got the “hat trick”
with five minutes gone in the final
period to put the Bisons ahead
8-1. Gettysburg scored again on
a mixup in the Bison backfield.
The final score of the game came
when Lyman Ott cut through the
center to take a free kick from
| Frank Famariss.

The Bisons meet Delaware this
| Friday, and then they meet Le-

10,000 WATCH BISONS LACE LAFAYETTE

by John Minsker

Before 10,000 delighted Home-
coming onlookers, the Bucknell
football machine rolled to their
third win of the season over the
hapless Leopards of Lafayette
College by a score of 28-0.

Lafayette, who came into the
game leading the Middle Atlantic
Conference with a 3-0 record, left
with nothing but bruises and a
lot of hard feelings, as coach Bob
Odell’s forces held the much
vaunted Leopard offense to a
mere 96 yards gained, while the
Bisons racked up 415. The visi-
tors tallied only four first downs
all afternoon against 20 forBU and
didn’t rack up a single one in the
first half. On one series of downs
the Bucknell defense threw the
Leopard backs for three consecu-
tive losses before they kicked on
fourth down: Charlie Bartos, La-

series of fumbles and pass inter-
‘ceptions in which the ball ex-
‘changed hands five times in the
\first five minutes of play. The
Bisons began their first scoring
|jaunt early in the second period.
Dean Stump blocked a Lafayette
quick kick attempt and the Herd
|yecovered on the visitors 44 yard
stripe. -After a first down by Ash
Ditka on the 28, Terhes swept left
jend to the 12 yard line. Four
|plays later, captain Mickey Mel-
berger, caught a pitchout at his
ankles and scampered into the
end zone for the touchdown. Ron
Maslanik’s conversion gave the
Bisons a 7-0 lead.

Terhes and Company got the
pall again on their own 23 with
only a minute to go in the half.

Bisons Face Tough |
Game With Lehigh

by Ted Odenwald
The Bisons are ih for a rough
game with the Engineers of Le-

high when they meet this Satur-  ”

day. The Engineers, led by full-
back Boyd Taylor and halfback
Al Richmond, are hungry for vic-
tory after receiving consecutive
shutout defeats at the hands of
Rutgers and Tufts.

In their first three games, Le-

high rolled over Delaware, 27-14; |

Colgate, 39-22; and Gettysburg, |
52-21. In 45 plays from scrim-
mage, quarterback John Highfield
directed his squad for an offensive
yardage total of 306 yards, an
average of 6.8 yards per play.
Taylor, a junior fullback, and Pat
Clark, a sophomore halfback, led
the team in scoring with 30 and
28 points respectively. Richmond
led the team in rushing with 140
in 31 attempts for a 4.5 average.
Highfield completed 12 of 25
passes for 252 yards. Jim Need-
ham was Highfield’s top receiver,
hauling in seven aerials for 203
yards.

In the games with Tufts.and
Rutgers, the Engineers couldn’t
seem to get their offense rolling.
Tufts held the Engineers to 63
rushing yards and 52 passing
yards while Rutgers allowed only
39 on the ground and 106 by the
air.

Plenty of Line Depth

With 11 starting lettermen onj|
the line, the Engineers have a}
tough, competent forward wall.
Two senior lettermen, Ed Murphy |
and John Van Deusen, are used
as both offensive and defensive
centers. Lehigh boasts fine talent
at the guard position since they
have four lettermen alternating
the positions. Doug Edwards and
Joe Posillico were the starting
guards last season while Dick
Parsons and Frank Buckworth
were standouts in the defensive
tackle slot. Junior lettermen
Reed Bohovich and Mike Sem-
cheski are considered by many to
be the best pair of starting tackles
in the Middle Atlantic Confer-
ence. Captain Bill Jones, Carl
Schwenker, and Jim Needham
are the alternating ends for the
Engineers.

With the loss of second string}
quarterback Walt King, Lehigh |
must count heavily on Highfield.
George Theiss and Bob Scheu are
Highfield’s replacements, but they
have seen very little action.

At the halfback slots, Richmond
and Clark are aided by senior let-
termen John Larimer and Chuck |
Lull, and sophomore Ed Winches-
ter. Last season, Lull was the
Engineer’s number two ground
gainer in total offense. He gain-
ed 287 yards rushing, on 83 at-|
tempts, and gained 43 yards on)
pass receptions.

Boyd Taylor, a junior, has the
fullback position sewn up. Last}
season, he led the Engineers in
total offense as he gained 339)
yards rushing in 106 attempts.
Sophomore Andy Larko and let-
terman Charlie Wentz will share
the number two spot.

The Engineers defense has put
on some fine exhibitions. In five}
games, they have given up 760
rushing yards for a 52 yards-per-
game average. They have allow- |
ed 366 passing yards for a 73-
yards-per-game average.

Lehigh hasn’t faced anything |
like the Bison’s Turk Terhes.
Having completed 54 of 93 passes,
Terhes has accounted for 726 of |
Bucknell’s total yardage. Only|
Gettysburg dnd Colgate presented
anything similar to a passing at-

Last Sunday evening a truly |
delightful concert was presented
by May Mukle, ’cellist, and P.,

ing the program by announcing |
that she had been playing for} 5
only six months because of a re-|
cent accident, Miss Mukle pro-
ceeded to play Anton Dvorak’s|
Waldesruhe, originally written for
cello and orchestra. The 80-year
old cellist plays in the older tra-
dition, that tradition which pro-
motes graceful slurring and slid- |
ing from note to note, rather than |
the recent impeccably clean note- |
playing.
The second number was a Val-

Report from Abroad:

Bill Jacobson Discusses Life in London

by Wm. Jay Jacobson II
London, Oct. 6, 1960
This column is being |written
while I’m on a _ Junior-Year-
Abroad at the University of Man-
chester, in England. I will at-
tempt to bring interesting obser-
vations back to the “300” from all
over Europe, and to imparta

course of traveling.

Sailing from New York on the
S. S. United States on Sept. 28, I!
found the boat full of students,’
mostly doing graduate’ work.
Many of them were bound for
Italy to go to medical school
there, and many were Rhode’s
Scholars. Even in this age of
economy jet flights, sailing to
Europe is still far less expensive
than flying, and much more fun.
The food and service are extra-
ordinary, and there are things to
do every minute of your trip. We
docked at Le Havre about dawn
on Monday, Oct. 3, and spent two
hours in port unloading. It is in-
teresting to note that while the
color of the ocean is a deep blue,
the English Channel is a light
greenish color.
passengers for England cannot
disembark—even for a few hours
—at Le Havre, so a column on
France will have to wait a few
more issues!

We docked at Southhampton
that afternoon, after a mild cross-
ing, and from there I took the
train-boat to London. Customs
is nothing, and even though the
train-boats here were about 30
years old, the entire trip was very
pleasant.

London Tour

The very next day I took a
tour of London, and spent the en-
tire day wandering about trying
to compare ‘London with New
York. It is impossible—this city
is so vast and so marvelous that
it must stand completely in its
own light, rather than suffer by
any comparison to the United
States. The first thing you no-
tice in London, of course, is not
the fog but the left-hand driving.
If you’re not used to this, cross-
ing a street becomes a difficult
and dangerous process. Cars in
London do not use their road
lights, either; these are used only
for passing and on the open road
—the rest of the time your park-
ing lights must suffice. Some of
the street lights in various parts
of London are yellow, too—be-
cause of the fog.

The great big red London

ably. Fares are all different, de-

"Idea of University’

by Sue Peltz

The results are in! Our next
president and vice president are
Richard M. Nixon and Henry
Cabot Lodge! Thus did the vot-
ing population of Bucknell make
known its preference. Approxi-
mately 30% of the student body
cast ballots on Nov. 1, giving Vice
President Nixon 477 votes, while
his opponent, Senator John F.
Kennedy, received 237. Not
enough members of either the ad-
ministration or the faculty voted,
to make it possible to legitimate-
ly gencralize about trends in
either area.

ena of the election was ascertain-
ed when the student’s family
party affiliation was correlated
with the way he actually voted.
Out of the 237 votes cast for Ken-
nedy, approximately 91 that is,
almost half, voted differently from
their family. On the other side,
only 23, out of 477, crossed the
line from Democrat to Republi-
jcan. This is perhaps the most
| significant discovery made by the
\mock election. Discussions fol-
lowing the publication of the re-
sults showed that no one was
much surprised by the outcome

ABBOTT ANNOUNCES
MID-TERM GRADES

Frank Abbott, assistant dean of
the University, announced today
that “all students should receive
their midsemester grades not later
than November 1]. The newly
instigated six week grade report
will list only A’s, D’s, and F's.

The change from the eight
week report to that of a six week
one, was enacted, according to
Dean Abbott, as the mean point
between four week freshman
grades and the usual eight week
grades. Four week grades were
found to be unsatisfactory since
they did not allow a sufficient
time for a professor to evaluate
a student’s progress. Eight week
grades were equally unsatisfac-
tory since by the time they had
been collected and processed, it

was too late for the student to im-

prove his marks significantly.

Our Challenge

Plans are already underway for a February conference
that will build on creative student thinking about world
affairs. To be known as the Challenge, the discussion
series will replace the Newsmen’s Conference, which in
former years has been little more than a stale repetition
of newspaper debate.

The Challenge will, instead, strike out for new partici-
pants from various professions and economic viewpoints,
including noted scholars, politicians and newsmen. Two
days of concentrated lecture and debate will provide the
opportunity for well-informed students to engage in con-
structive inquiry on issues such as socialized medicine,
public health insurance, American foreign aid and partici-
pation of labor in management.

Although relatively isolated from the nail-biting devel-
opments of the American economic scene, we are fortu-
nate in being able to follow these events in the New York
Times. The opportunity of interrogating these men who
make and record this news is, however, a windfall for the
inquisitive student. First-hand answers to questions on
the economic and political philosophies, soon to confront
us in our jobs and communities, are seldom within such
easy reach of the ordinary citizen.

In preparation for this conference, a “brains trust” of
eight professors and eight students met to discuss a pos-
sible theme early last month. Among the professors pres-
ent were Dr. William B. Gwyn, Prof. Kenneth J. Roth-
well, Dr. James A. Gathings, Dr. Ralph Spielman, Dr.
Robert Butts, Prof. Douglas E. Sturm, Prof. Philip M.
Withim, and Dr. Douglas K. Candland.

We cannot overlook the fact that some of the most bril-
liant minds on Bucknell’s teaching staff have displayed
an interest in the Challenge and its potential stimulation
of critical thinking among students here. In future
months, a committee, under the chairmanship of Marsha
O’Bannon, will weave together the tenuous strings of
theme, discussion topics, and public relations, necessary
for the importation of scholars, newsmen and philoso-
phers to a college campus. Periodic publicity will inform
the campus of progressive developments.

The point we wish to make is that the Challenge is an
exciting program rapidly expanding in scope and involv-
ing us with a concrete world. It is with anticipation that
this staff looks forward to February 23 and 24 when stu-
dents, armed with questions and ideas, will cross-examine
outstanding politicians and labor leaders.

In undertaking such a conference, we have shown our-
selves concerned with Bucknell’s “dedication to the cause
of free and responsible inquiry and to the seeking of the
truth wherever it may be found.” It would seem that the
progenitors of the Challenge have dedicated a remarkably
functional turnpike leading to our destination.

Plan Ahea
d

In today’s complex society the common trend is toward
long-range planning. Modern technology, the increasing
impersonality of social contact, and the shrinkage of the
globe by means of advancements in transportation and
communication have necessitated this far-sighted plan-
ning in order to insure the efficient functioning of society.

But then there is our own dear University, who, in her
efforts to combat conformity, has reverted to the idea of
formulating short-term plans. It seems like only last
spring that coeds began using the newly completed stair-
way leading to Tustin Gym. And now this same stairway
is being removed. There is a new wing (undreamed of
last spring, of course!) being added to the gym, and these
steps are now in the way.

The grass in the academic quad in front of the library
was so nice and green (after it finally grew high enough
to cover the scars left by the construction of Coleman
Hall), and then someone decided that trees might enhance
the area. So the grass was uprooted. The turf barely
had time to recover before someone realized that a water
main had to be laid between Coleman Hall and the new
Administration Center. Since the workmen couldn’t quite
burrow from one building to the other, the grass “got the
ax” again.

Oh, yes! You must have noticed by now the face-lift-
ing job recently done on Bucknell’s highway system. The
most noticeable of these additions and corrections is prob-
ably the disappearance of the roadway from Vaughan
Literature Building to Davis Gym. It seems that the plan-
ning program calls for a circuitous route between these
two points. The highway system has now been rounded
out, at least temporarily, by that splendid boulevard, lov-
ingly known as Geiger’s Super Highway, which cuts
straight across campus in a most essential direction.

All is not lost, however, because the considerate plan-
ners have provided sidewalks to complement the highway
system. Of course the cross-walk at the Vaughan Liter-
ature Building isn’t situated just right, and everyone cuts
across the grass (intended grass, that is). But this is a
small matter, and wholly in tune with the present plan-
ning program.

These energetic planners certainly do deserve a vote of
confidence. How’else could the University be consistent
in its physical improvement program and still avoid con-
forming to the long-range trend now being adopted else-
where in the United States?

AS MEMORIES FOND COME TROOPING BY

by Jane Tilton

| Lewisburg 1891

The football record at Bucknell this year is one that we of Lew-
isburg feel obligated to comment. In spite of the fact that Bucknell
is still considered one of the smaller eastern colleges, they have man-
aged to produce a team that was able to beat Lafayette 16 to 10, State
College 12 to 10, and Cornell University 4 to 0.

These triumphs are to the credit of the team. They have been
forced to play their games under every possible disadvantage. Being
without a coach, as well as sufficient time in which to practice, the
men seem to win by pure determination. For instance it has been
reported by one member of the Cornell football team that Bucknell
has but one signal: “One, two, three—give me the ball.”

Yet Bucknell football has certainly come a long way from its
meager beginning in a game with Lafayette only eight years ago.
Never having played football before, the team was literally forced to
learn the gameas it played it. The original team consisted of but
11 men and one substitute. The game was played with little previ-
ous practice; as a matter of fact, no member of that first team had
ever even seen a football game, no less played in one. The final
score: Lafayette 59, Bucknell 0.

Congratulations to the Bucknell football team. We comment on
your past and look hopefully to your future.

“Flattery is like perfume. The idea is to smell it, not swallaw

it,” recommends The Keystonian, of Keystone Junior College.
shee
Just a few thoughts from the Pitt News:

“The trouble with getting home work done in time is not in find-
ing the time to study, but in studying during the time found.”

“A coincidence is when a person taking a long-cut meets the very
person he was trying to avoid.”

“In telling a person a supposedly spontaneous joke, the only ex-
perience that is more embarrassing than discovering, half-way
through the joke, that you’ve already told it to him before, is to re-
call suddenly, half-way through such a story, that it was from your
very listener that you stole it.”

LETTERS TO.
THE EDITOR

Dear Bucknellians,

In a very short time this year’s
Religion-in-Life Program will be
at hand. (Nov. 13-16 and Nov.
20). I am writing this letter in
order to acquaint you with the
theme for this year’s program and
to give you some necessary in-
formation.

After studying for four years at
Bucknell, what will our college
education mean to us? Will it
simply be a degree for degree’s
sake, or will our degree symbolize
a much greater and more mean-
ingful educational experience?
How can our campus activities
in classrooms, in fraternities and
sororities, and in campus organiz-
ations contribute to our educa-
tional experience? These are just
some of the questions that have
come up while we were discuss-
ing our theme for this year’s pro-
gram, The Idea of the University.

Last week we read an editorial
in this newspaper pointing out
the basic differences and confus-
ions apparent between the idea of
the “old Bucknell” and the “new
Bucknell”. We feel that our Re-
ligion-in-Life Program this year
offers a great opportunity to
everyone—faculty, students, and
administration—to see if Bucknell
is really where we want it to be
or to investigate roads of further
improvement and clarification.

Our program this year will of-
fer the opportunity for student-
faculty discussions about our edu-
jcation. We have three excellent
leaders coming in to present their
views on this very topic—The
Idea of the University. These
three leaders are: Dr. Harold
Taylor, Dr. Victor Yanitelli, and
Dr. Shubert Ogden.

We have planned to have an
“all Bucknell” panel one evening
made up of professors and stu-
dents who will attempt tosee how
the Idea of the University relates
to our problems here at Bucknell.
Dr. Sturm of the Religion depart-
ment has prepared an excellent
syllabus entitled The Idea of the
University.

In this issue of the Bucknellian
you will see various articles about
our coming program. I would
like to urge you to read these, to
acquire a copy of the syllabus,
and above all to participate in the
program with enthusiasm and in-
telligence. I think this program
has a great deal to offer to the
campus; we must participate to
get its full meaning and message.

Editor:

Several weeks ago one of the
fraternities on our campus receiv-
ed a visit from a representative
ofits national organization. This
man came from a considerable
distance to present the highest
award which it was within the
power of his fraternity to give a
local chapter — The Superior
Chapter Award. The award was
based upon five criteria: adminis-
tration, chapter relations, mem-
bership, scholarship, and alumni
relations. In presenting the
trophy the spokesman described
the purposes of the national or-
ganization and indicated that the
Bucknell chapter had been in
close contention for the award
ever since it had first been offer-
ed. : .

This kind of recognition is an
honor not only to the individual
fraternity, but to Bucknell as
well. On behalf of the Univer-
sity I would like to congratulate
George Coogan, and the brothers
of the Demosthenian Chapter of
Delta Upsilon, upon an. outstand-
ing achievement.

‘Good Housekeeping’ Quotes

History Professor’s Work

End Child Labor Now, an ar-
ticle by A. E. Farrell appearing in
the Nov. issue of Good House-
keeping magazine, commends the
work of Dr. Cyrus H. Karrak-
er, associate professor of history,
students in regard to the problem.

“When Dr. Cyrus Karraker, a
teacher of history at Bucknell
University in Pennsylvania, heard
about the conditions of migrants
in Potter county, he went himself
for a first-hand look. Jolted by
what he saw, Dr. Karraker called
a campus meeting to tell*his stu-
dents and fellow professors about
his findings. The result was the
formation of the: Pennsylvania
Citizens Committee on Migratory
Labor. A neighbor of Karraker’s.
Mrs. Lois Garnvin, became execu-
tive secretary of the group. Since
then the organization has helped
activate an official state agency to
concern itself with migrant prob-
lems. Karraker’s students got to
work too. By organizing bake
sales and other fund raising ven-
tures, several girls’ dormitories
collected enough money to pro-
vide college scholarships for de-
serving migrant children. The
work of these people has set off

a chain reaction which has made }

Pennsylvania one of the more ad-
vanced states for easing the mi-
grant plight.”

Debaters Tax
Brown and MIT

The Bucknell Debate squad di-
vided its wins and losses evenly
at its first tournament of the year.
Seeing action at Brown Univer-
sity debating the topic, “Resolv-
ed; that the U. S. should adopt a
system of compulsory medical in-
surance for all citizens,” were
John Werner, Al Deprince on the
affirmative and Maurice Nern-
berg, Don Wright on the negative.

In the win column, City College
of New York and Mass. Institute
of Technology, last year’s first
place winner, were defeated by
the negative half of the team
while St. John College and the
| University of Maine fell before
the affirmative side. The society
{was defeated in close decisions by
Eastern Nazarene in two rounds,
Holy Cross, and Georgetown Uni-
versity who won second place in
the entire tournament. Harvard
University won the first place
team trophy in a field of $2 teams.

The novice team attended a
practice tournament at Lehigh on
Oct. 29. Representing Bucknell
were: Karen Heske, Ann Wagner,

Dick Boddie, and Fran Melick.
Though no decisions were given

THE PARTY WEEKEND: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE

With the season of party weekends almost upon us, my mail of
late has been flooded with queries from young inmates of women’s
colleges wishing to know how one conducts one’s self when one
has invited a young gentleman for a weekend, so let us today
take up this burning issue.

Well, my dear girls, the first thing to remember is that your
young gentleman is far from home and frighteried. Put him at
his ease. You might, for instance, surprise him by having his
mother sitting in a rocker on the station platform when he gets
off the train.

Next, what kind of corsage should you send your young gentle-
man? Well, my beloved maidens, orchids are always acceptable.
So, indeed, are phlox and delphinium. In fact, most any flora
will serve. Do try, however, to avoid carnivorous plants.

If you find, my esteemed fillies, that your local florist has run
out of stock, do not be dismayed. Make a corsage out of paper.
But pick good, stiff, durable paper—twenty dollar bills, for
example.

Remember at all times, my fond wenches, to show your young
gentleman courtesy and consideration. Open doors for him,
walk on the traffic side of the path, assist him to the punch bowl,
zip his parka, light his Marlboros. (What, you ask, if he doesn’t
smoke Marlboros? Ridiculous, my precious nymphs! Of course,
he smokes Marlboros! Don’t you? Don’t I? Doesn’t everybody
who knows a hawk from a handsaw? What other cigarette
gives you such a lot to like? Such easy-drawing filtration? Such
unfiltered taste? Such soft pack or flip-top box? No other, my
sweet minxes, no other. Marlboro stands alone, and any man
worthy of you, my estimable damsels, is bound to be a Marlboro
man.)

veces ———__=
Guthrie bite where le

If you will follow the simple instructions stated above, my
good lasses, you will find that you have turned your young
gentleman into a fast and fervent admirer. There is nothing
quite like a party weekend to promote romance. I am in mind
of a party weekend some years ago at Miss Pomfritt’s Seminary
for well-born females in West Linotype, Ohio. Serafina Sigafoos,
H a sophomore at this institution, majoring in napkin folding, sent
an invitation to a young man named Fafnir Valve, a junior at
the Joyce Kilmer School of Forestry, majoring in sap and boles.
Serafina had been ape for Fafnir since high school, but Fafnir
preferred a girl named Gelia Fleshwound, the high school drum
majorette who once threw a baton so high she impaled a south-
bound mallard.

Anyhow, Serafina sent an invitation to Fafnir, and he came,
and she showered him with kindness and cuff links, and then
he went away, and Serafina sat anxiously by the mailbox,
wondering whether she would ever hear from him again. Sure
enough, two weeks later she got a letter: “Dear Serafina, Can
you let me have fifty bucks? Yours, Fafnir.” :

Whimpering with ecstasy, she ran to the bank and withdrew
the money and mailed it to him. From then on, she got the
same request every week, and as a result, she became very well
acquainted with Ralph T. Involute, teller of the West Linotype
Bank and Trust Co., and their friendship ripened into love, and
today they are happily married and live in Stamen, Oregon,
where Ralph is in the extruded molasses game and Serafina

is a hydrant. bie : © 1960 Max Shulmaz

The Sidelines

A Brotherly Tradition
On the west coast when you mention football and brothers in the
same breath, it’s the McKeevers who first come to mind. In the east
a new tradition in brotherly recognition may have been founded last
week when both Ashton Ditka, Bucknell’s superb halfback, and Mike
Ditka, All-American choice at Pitt were BOTH named to the ECAC
All-East football team of the week. Both Ditkas were instrumental

in important victories scored by their teams.

. Syracuse Upset

Syracuse, riding the crest of a 16-game winning streak, and num-
mer one in the nation last year, fell victim to an inspired Pitt team
and were soundly beaten 10-0. All season long Syracuse had squeak-
ed through game after game. After shellacking West Virginia two
weeks ago, the “Big Orange” were again rated as one of the top teams
in the country. But hardnosed Pitt, which has lost some real heart-
breakers this season, exacted a terrific punishment upon the New
Yorkers.

The Lambert Cup
Bucknell had its eye on the Lambert Cup this year, after soundly
thrashing Buffalo and Lafayette and losing a thriller to Rutgers 23-
19. A victory over Lehigh would put the Bisons in a very favorable
spot, especially a convincing victory. Ash was the key to the “con-
vincing” victory as he scored two of the three Bison touchdowns and

| caught six passes for 68 yards as well as picking up 38 yards on the

round. He accounted for over one-third of Bucknell’s total offense

last Saturday.

A Triple Threat

Both Ditkas are of the mighty shoulders, slim hip variety. Na-
tives of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, they both starred in football and
j basketball at Aliquippa High. Mike is a three-sport star at Pitt and
| can be best remembered for a memorable performance on the base-
ball diamond at Bucknell last year. Somewhat irritated by the jibes
| of several bench jockeys, big Mike hit one of the longest home runs
| ever seen at Bucknel

CHESTERFIELD, L&M and OASIS invite you to the

I would like to express my appreciation to you for your more
than generous response to my article and my requests. When I re-

turned this September I was quite concerned with the problem of|%

finding someone to read tome. Thanks to your interest, the problem

of finding readers has virtually been solved. I now have an ever in-|§
creasing list of people who are willing to read to me, and as some of

them know already, reading to me is not quite so hard as some may
imagine. They are finding such work not only to be helpful to me,
but a help to them.

I hope that this shall continue*to be the case, for I like’the pro-
cess of reading to be a two sided affair, where both parties benefit.
To those of you that are now reading to me, I do not think that a

_ mere “thank you” as expressed by these printed words is sufficient,

but in many cases, words are often lacking in their ability to express
fully the feelings behind them.

Say Hello

For those of you who have stopped to make my acquaintance I
am grateful. As I said in that first article, I would like to meet as
many people as possible and to get to know them.

Fear not, I will not, upon you introducing yourself to me, grab
you and say “Read to me.” If you are interested in doing reading, it
will be left up to you to say so. é
My World

“My World” is the title under which I hope to write, during the
course of this coming year, various articles telling of my world. It
is true that each of us sees the world in a different way. But, know-
ing that to many of you my world would seem quite different from
that which you know, I hope that the world in which I live and the
world in which you live may prove to be connected. For is not “my
world” also your world?

One of the questions which I am frequently asked is: “How do
you get around.” Perhaps one of the reasons why this question is
so difficult to answer is that I myself do not really think about how
I get around. Just as you, day after day, go from here to there and
back again without really thinking about each step, so it is with me.

We all know how to walk, but if asked how to do it, most of us
would probably take a considerable amount of time in forming a
clear informative answer to this question. So it is when you ask me
how I get around; I must stop and think how to answer you as simply
and understandably as possible. Just as each of you had to learn to
walk, I too had to learn some “tricks of the trade” of traveling. Many
things have become almost second nature now.

I might as well begin with the most obvious of my “tricks,” that
is, my cane. I took a course at Overbrook in the use of a cane for
traveling. Naturally as with everything else, most of what I know
about using a cane has been learned through experience,

Cane Touch

As you know, the sense of touch is very important to me. The
cane I carry is actually a means by which I am able to feel the
ground before me and know, to a greater or lesser degree, what is in
my path. The cane is, in reality, an extension of my finger. Con-
trary to the general belief of most people, the cane is not used, ex-
cept in rare incidents, to make a tapping noise.

It is used to tell the difference between the paved walk and the
ground or grass along side the walk. Thus I use the edge of the
walks as a guide to assist me in my travels. Naturally, if I happen
to misjudge the edge of the walk, I may find myself on another path.

| This friend was walking down a street in New York. He came
{to a street corner which had no street-light. If a light were there |
| he would have listened to the traffic to tell when to cross. So he stood |
\ there a moment and then sensed that there was some living obj:
before him. He asked if it was all right to cross, but got no reply. Hi
asked several more times, but still with no reply. He finally bellow-
ed out, “Is it all right to cross.” The horse that was standing before!

During the preliminary talks
held at Melun, “France,” from
June 25-29, the attitude of the
French government indicated
clearly that the conditions and
modalities of the future meeting
between the French and Algerian
delegations were to be unilateral-
ly decided by France. In view of
France, the talks were to be a
monologue.

Keeping my general direction is very important also. If you

just which way to go. When coming to a new place for the first time,
I usually have someone walk me to the various places where I am to

of where various buildings, etc. are located.

Mr. Newton seemed to dominate
the whole production, which was
partly due to the type of play

The director, Grenville Cuyler,
was unable to overcome the prob-

third of thé audience was ignored
throughout the play. The char-

Algeria presents a tragic ex-

As Algerians we are certain,

LEWISBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1960.

JACK KENNEDY SWAMPS NIXON

t

President-Elect—JOHN F, KENNEDY

The second eldest of nine chil- gerald, mayor of Boston and U.S.

dren was born to a family with
a long tradition of public service. |
His mother’s father was mayor of
Boston; his father’s grandfather
served in both houses of the
Massachuseets legislature, and his
own father was once Ambassador
to Great Britain.

A graduate of Harvard Univer- |
sity in 1940, he attended the Lon-
don School of Economics, and di
graduate work at Stanford Uni-
versity.

During World War II, Senator
Kennedy commanded a PT boat |
in the South Pacific. He was dec- |
orated twice by the Navy for “his |
courage, endurance, and excellent |
leadership” in rescuing injured |
members of his crew.

After serving as a congressman |
from 1946 to 1952, Kennedy de-|
feated Henry Cabot Lodge to be- |
come Senator from Massachusetts
by 70,000 votes, despite an other-
wise Eisenhower - Republican
sweep in that state. In 1958, he
won re-election by the largest
margin ever accorded a candidate
in either party in the history of
the state. The Senator is a mem-
ber of the Foreign Relations, the
Labor and Public Welfare, Joint
Economic, and Select Committee
to Investigate Improper Activities
in the Labor and Management
Field.

A former correspondent for INS
and the Chicago Herald American,
he is the author of many maga-
zine articles, the book, Why Eng-
land Slept, and the Pulitzer Prize

inning, Profiles in Courage, and
The Strategy of Peace. Senator
Kennedy is married to the former
Jacqueline Lee Bouvier and is the
father of Caroline, born in 1947.
The Kennedys expect another
child in December.

Public service is a Kennedy
family tradition. His father,
Joseph P. Kennedy, is the former
Ambassador to Great Britain and
one-time chairman (appointed by
Franklin Delano Roosevelt) of
both the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Federal
Maritime Commission. His mother
is the former Rose Fitzgerald,
daughter of the late John F. Fitz-

Congressman. His grandfather
was a member of the Massachu
setts State House and Senate.

Senator Kennedy’s concern for;

world peace has taken him to
Russia, Germany, China, Israel,
Poland, India, Korea, and 27 other |

countries in Latin America, the |

| time went on.

Election Settled
In Wee Hours

: by Barry Podber
Starting slowly, but picking up
momentum with each passing
hour, Senator John F, Kennedy
jled | the Democratic Party back
‘into'the White House after an ab-
sence of eight years.
The vote, as most polls predict-
ed, was extremely close in the
|popular column, but in the all
| important electoral-vote area the
| young Senator swept to a power-
ful and inspiring victory. |
Kennedy showed that he was
| able to overcome the so-called re-
ligious issue. He met his oppon- |
ent head-on when the issue of}
| maturity was introduced into the |
jcampaign. The Democratic trend |
jstarted when the Democrats won| *
the state of Conn. by a majority |
| of more than 80,000.
The large majorities which
| Senator Kennedy rolled up in the

| industrial cities of Conn. gave!

Quiz: How Much Do You Know
About America’s Presidents

You may find that the chief interest of this quiz lies in the an-
swers (on page 4) and in the discovery of how little you know about
the history of the Presidency.

. Who was the youngest man to be elected President?

. What is the President’s salary?

. What state has contributed the greatest number of Presidents?

. What President never went to school? ;

. What three Prsidents were assassinated?

. Who was the only President to face impeachment?

. Who was the only President to be married in the White House?
What two Presidents received fewer popular votes than their
opponents, but still were elected?

This is the B-52. Advanced as it
may be, this airplane has one thing
in common with the first war-
galleys of ancient Egypt...and
with the air and space vehicles of
the future. Someone must chart its
course. Someone must navigate it.

For certain young men this pre-
sents a career of real executive
opportunity. Here, perhaps you
will have the chance to master a
profession full of meaning, excite-
ment and rewards...as a Naviga-
tor in the U.S Air Force.

To qualify for Navigator train-
ing as an Aviation Cadet you must
be an American citizen between 19
and 26'%4—single, healthy and in-
telligent. A high school diploma is
required, but some college is highly
desirable. Successful completion of
the training program leads to a
commission as a Second Lieuten-
ant...and your Navigator wings.

If you think you have what it
takes to measure up to the Avia-
tion Cadet Program for Naviga-
tor training, see your local Air
Force Recruiter. Or clip and mail

restore our national strength—
military, political, economic, and
moral. *
National Defense

This is the strength that must
be erected:

(1) Deterrent military power;
(2) balanced conventional mili-
tary forces; (3) continuous mod-
ernization of these forces through
intensified research and develop-
ment; and (4) re-examination of
the organization of our armed
forces.

We pledge our will, energies,
and resources to oppose Commun-
ist aggression.

Arms Control

A primary task is to develop
responsible proposals that will
help break the deadlock on arms
control.

Such proposals should include
means for ending nuclear tests
under workable safeguards, cut-
ting back nuclear weapons, reduc-
ing conventional forces, preserv-
ing outer space for peaceful pur-
poses, preventing surprise attack,
and limiting the risk of accidental
war. |
Instruments of Foreign Policy |

We will recruit officials whose
experience, humanity, and dedi-j;
cation fit them for the task of ef- |
fectively representing America
abroad. |

We will provide a more sensi-
tive and creative direction to our
overseas information program.
And we will overhaul our ad-}
ministrative machinery so that
America may avoid diplomatic}
embarrassments and at long last|
speak with a single confident |
voice in world affairs. |

leadership, and capital, to create
an abundance that will outstrip
any other system.

We Democrats believe that our
economy can and must grow at
an average rate of 5% annually,

almost twice as fast as our aver- |

age annual rate since 1953. We
pledge ourselves to policies that
will achieve this goal without in-
flation.
An End to Tight Money

As the first step in speeding
economic growth, a Democrat
President will put an end to the
high-interest tight-money policy.

A new Democratic Administra-
tion will reject this philosophy of
economic slowdown. We are com-
mitted to maximum employment,

jat decent wages and with fair

profits, in a far more productive,
oxpanding economy.
Control of Inflation

The American consumer has a
right to fair prices. We are de-
termined to secure that right.

A fair share of the gains from
nereasing productivity in miany
industries should be passed on to
the consumer through price re-
luctions.

Minimum Wages

We pledge to raise the mini-

num wage to $1.25 an hour and

to extend coverage to several mil-;

lion workers not now protected.
Agriculture

We shall take positive action to)

raise farm income to full parity

levels and to preserve the family |

farming as a way of life.
We shall put behind us once |

fiber.

food consumption both at home
and abroad.

The new Demo Adminis-

tration will act to make our free
economy really free—free from}
|the oppression of monopolistic}
| power, and free from the suffo- |
cating impact of high interest
| rates. We will-help create an
economy in which small busi-
nesses can take root, grow, and,
flourish.
| Health |
| We shall provide medical care |
| benefits for the aged as part of
the time-tested Social Security
j insurance system. We reject any}
| proposal which would require
such citizens td submit to the in-
dignity of a means test—a “‘paup-
er’s oath.”

A Program for the Aging

The Democratic Administration
will end the neglect of our older
citizens. They deserve lives of
usefulness, dignity, independence,
and participation. We shall as-
sure them not only health care
!but employment for those who
want work, decent housing, and
recreation.

Education

} America’s young people are
!our greatest resource for the fu-
‘ture. Each of them deserves the |
! education which will best develop |
| his potentialities.

We shall.act at once to help in|
building ‘the classrooms and em-|
;ploying the teachers that are es-
sential if the right to a good edu- |
cation is to have genuine meaning |
for all the youth of America in
the decade ahead. |

Solution to Presidential Quiz

1. Theodore Roosevelt, 42, was the youngest man to be elected

President.

2. The President’s salary is $100,000 a year.

3. Virginia has produced more Presidents than any other state—
eight: Washington Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, William H.
Harrison, Tyler, Taylor, and Wilson.

. Andrew Johnson never went to school.

(Lincoln—general be-

lief to the contrary—attended, for short periods, two schools
in Kentucky before he was seven, and three other schools af-

ter his family moved to southern Indiana.

His formal educa-

tion totaled less than a year, but Johnson had no formal

schooling whatsoever.)

. The three Presidents who were assassinated were: Abraham
Lincoln, 1865; James A. Garfield, 1881; and William McKin-

fey, 1901.

. Andrew Johnson was the only President to face impeachment.
When he removed Secretary of State Stanton from office and
replaced him with Grant, Congress denied the President’s

right to remove a cabinet member.

At his trial by the Senate,

the vote was 35 for conviction, 19 for acquital. As a two-thirds
majority is necessary for conviction, he was acquitted.

. Grover Cleveland was married in the White House to Miss
Frances Folsom on June 2, 1886.

. Rutherford B. Hayes received fewer popular votes than
Samuel J. Tilden in 1877, but was elected by 185 electoral

votes to 184.

In 1888, Benjamin Harrison received fewer pop-

‘ular votes than Grover Cleveland but won with 233 electoral

votes to 168.

arts curriculum, was elected prési-
dent. While at Haverford High
School, Lee was vice president of

urer of the Junior Classical
League, and a member of the var-
sity tennis team. Presently Lee

room. president and as a member
of the ¢lass cabinet. Upon grad-
uation in 1959 he studied in Eng-
land as an exchange student.

Secretary Elected

Char Edwards, a history major
from Shaker Heights, Ohio, was
elected secretary. In high school
Char was active in the Student
Council, the Social Council, and

Women To Sponsor
WSGA Party Night

Nov. 18 is the date set for the
third. WSGA Party Night. At
this time the women students will
once again play hostess to the
men for the evening.

A carnival in Larison, bridge
in Harris and dancing to the
music of the “Treble Tones” in
Hunt will provide continuous en-
tertainment from 8 p. m.,to 12.

Ann Wiley, social chairman of

WSGA, has announced the fol-}

lowing chairmen for the event:
Sue Ward, Larison; Carol Pope,

DEPT. PROPOSES
B.S. IN GEOLOGY

The Geology arid Geography
department, under the chairman-
ship of Richard P. Nickelsen, an-
nounces a proposal for a new cur-
riculum in geology leading to the
B. S. degree. The proposed B. S.
degree is designed for the student
who wishes to become a profes-
sional geologist or who plans on
pursuing graduate work in geol-
‘ogy, geochemistry, geophysics, or
oceanography. The proposed de-
gree program offers a minimum
of essential courses in the basic
sciences of mathematics, chemis-
try and physics for the scientifi-
ally-oriented student who desires
a career in Earth Science. It will
provide him with an adequate
background to pursue his science
studies at the graduate level, but
interested students will be urged
to elect additional work in chem-
istry, mathematics and biology.

Basic sciences are receiving in-
creased emphasis in geology cur-
ricula throughout the country and
without the minimum require-
ments listed here. Bucknell geol-
ogy majors will be unable to com-
pete for acceptance and graduate
scholarships in the better grad-
uate department.

Dramatists Present
Naturalistic’ Drama

by Mike Ingraham

Last weekend, Cap & Dagger
| attempted its most difficult play
in four years. It was Gorki’s
The Lower Depths, an example
of “naturalistic” drama, depicting
the demoralized, poverty-stricken
| state of the Russian citizenery be-
fore the revolution.

Naturalism, a form of Realism,
tends to emphasize the morbid
side of life and to escape tradi-
tional theatrical devices of plot
development and resolution; ap-
pearing, as it were, to be merely
a segment of human existence
lifted, quite arbitrarily, out of
context. There seems to be no
middle, and end in
such drama, nor is anything solv-
ed, resolved, or completed.

At the beginning of The Lower
Depths, we see a group of dis-
couraged individuals and at the
end we see this same group in the
same state of mind, minus a few
characters who have died. It
would seem as if nothing has hap-
pened, nothing has been settled.
But, of course, a great deal has
happened in the transition and
much accomplished.

Characters

We have come to understand
the 16 characters in the play as
distinct and separate individuals
by their responses to their en-
vironment and to the old man,
Luka. If nothing is drastically
|changed at the end, it is not be-
cause of the playwright’s inepti-
tude, but because of the charac-
| ters themselves.

The Baron, played by Bruce

Yanitelli presently serves as Vice Yanitelli will participate in the| | Matthews, an example of the idle,

irresponsible aristocrat suddenly
\thrown upon his own resources,
never develops because of his es-
| sentially insubstantial nature and
| limited mentality. Bubnoff, the
{realist of the play, stubbornly re-
sists the idealistic nonsense of
Luka and remains a detached
| observer throughout.
Stage Position

Notice that he stays on the left
side of the stage for almost the
entire action, indicating his ad-
amant position. Andrushka
| Kleshtch, portrayed by Mr. Ward
| Hooker, places himself on the ex-
treme right and is continually
bathed in an erie green light. He
is in the opposite condition from
Bubnoff—utterly smashed by his
environment.

However, Nastya, Satine, the
Actor, Vaska, and Natasha occupy
the middle ground—not quite
j}subdued by their surroundings
and still able to visualize a bet-
ter existence. And into this at-
{mosphere comes the old ‘man,
Luka, the catalytic agent, bring-
ng promise and chance for escape.
The reaction is immediate—the
| hopeful fasten onto him for in-
spiration while the wretched
scorn and abuse.

lables to elleviate his people’s

and find themselves in worse con-
dition than before—Vaska mur-

and are a deeper appreciation of
the purpose of an institution of
higher learning.

Within two days the Bucknell
campus will be involved in the
intensive Religion-in-Life Pro-|
gram’s study of The Idea of The
University. This year’s theme is
based on the apparent student
need to define what he expects
from the university. Because of
the thorough study in the pro-
gram, it requires full cooperation
of both faculty and students for}
its success. |

Compared to previdus Religion-
in-Life Programs based on esoter- |
ie and philosophical topics, this
year’s experience promises to be
unique. Its origin stems from
student requests for a theme with

A MODEST PROPOSAL

A movement is afoot—a shocking, startling movement —to
solve the problem of overcrowded colleges by the simple expe-
dient of refusing admission to women at coeducational schools!

It is argued by proponents of this plan that in today’s world
a college education is absolutely essential for a man, while for
a woman it is merely a pleasant interlude between adolescence
and housewifery. There is simply not room enough for both men
and women in our overburdened colleges; therefore, in all fair-
ness, women who have far less need of a degree than men, must
yield their places.

Well sir, when I heard this drastic proposal, I was so shocked
that I sat right down and lita Marlboro. I always sit right. down
and light a Marlboro when I am shocked. I also always sit right
down and light a Marlboro when I am not shocked. There is
no time, no condition, no mood, no estate when it isn’t a source
of soul-deep gratification to settle back and have a full-flavored
smoke— Marlboro, the filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste
— Marlboro, the jewel of cigarettes— Marlboro, the pinnacle of
the tobacconist’s art— Marlboro, my comfort, haven, and snug
harbor.

Well sir, I sat smoking my Marlboro and thinking over the
shocking proposal to keep women out of coed schools, and hoping
fervently that another solution can be found. If the calamitous
day ever comes when women are banned from coed colléges, I
will gnash my teeth and rend my garments and take to my bed
without supper. Like any other Marlboro man, I love women,
I love the sight and sound of them, the cut of their jibs, their
beauty and grace, their cunning little spitcurls, their sleek
dimples, their middy blouses, their aura and effluvium. More-
over, I freely admit that when it comes to brainpower, they can
give the average man cards and spades and big casino too. It
would be a shame, a disgrace and a catastrophe to keep these
beautiful, intelligent creatures out of college.

However, it is always wise in time of fair weather to prepare
for foul. What if the advocates of keeping women out of college
begin to gather strength? We who abhor this fiendish plan must
be ready with a substitute... and it just so happens I have
one—and a mighty ingenious little plan it is, if I say so myself.

Granted that classroom seats are in short supply, and granted
that men need degrees more than women, it is still not necessary
to bar women from college. Let them go te college but—here is
the beauty part of my plan—don’t let them go to class!

Ae = a
I ht ate “oud of Yor.

ole te sieht ated Sout Of Y9pI7...
This solution, it seems to me, answers every requirement. It
releases hundreds of thousands of classroom seats to needy males.
At the same time, it does not deprive women of the rich and
varied benefits of campus life. They can join sororities, shoot pool
at the Union, build bonfires for Homecoming games, pour at the
Dean’s tea, plait daisies in their hair, organize drag races, sculpt
in ice, hook rugs, walk their cheetahs, play Monopoly, find love

—in short, they can do anything except go to class.

nell’s three where Ashton Ditka
was waiting under it. Following
the catch he took several steps
backward into the end zone and
was brought down by some
hard charging Colgate tacklers.
' The play gave Colgate a two-point
safety against Bucknell, making
the score 6 to 2.

Bucknell’s second touchdown
was set up in the second quarter
when Pat Malone recovered a
Colgate fumble on the Red Raid-
ers 19-yard line. On two plays
the ball was advanced to the 10-
yard line where Ray Cosgrove re-
ceived a handoff from Elliott and
ran off tackle for a 10-yard gain
and Bucknell’s second and last
touchdown of the afternoon. The
try for the conversion resulted in
an incompleted pass making the‘
score 12 to 2.

Later on in the second quarter
a Colgate threat was thwarted as
a result of the alert line play of
Kirk Foulke, who recovered a)
Colgate fumble. This time Buck-
nell was unable to move the ball. |
With a fourth and six situation, |
Rick Elliott came in to punt and |
got away, a beauty. One of the
decisive factors in Bucknell’s vic-
tory is attributed to the kicking |
demonstration put on by Elliott.
Time afer time he got away some
of his best kicks of the season.

Colgate’s only touchdown came

of the second quarter had gone

line. Again Bucknell was unable
to move the ball and had to call
on Elliott to punt. With less than
two minutes remaining in the
game, Elliott punted the ball to
the Colgate 30-yard line where
the ball was whistled dead. On
ths last series of downs, Colgate
found a fired up Bison line wait- |
ing to turn back any threat. As
a result Colgate was unable to
pick up a yard in four tries. BU
took over on downs on Colgate’s ;
30 where Terhes ran out the time, |
thus giving Bucknell its fifth vic- |
tory against two defeats.

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

Win or Share It

Squeaked not swamped, yet still the winner is Jack
Kennedy. As in all contests one side must lose and one
must win, otherwise there would be no reason to toil for
victory. Despite the extreme narrowness of his margin
in the popular vote column, Senator Kennedy has become
President-Elect Kennedy. «President of those who voted
Democratic only? Hardly, John F. Kennedy is the 34th
president of the United States of America.

However, a good number of Bucknell students don’t
believe that Kennedy is to be the next president or they
have no respect for the office of President of the United
States. During the half-time ceremonies of last week’s
football game, the Temple University Band was present-
ing a musical tribute to some of America’s past chief ex-
ecutives. Their last tribute was a song dedicated to Mr.
Kennedy. Unfortunately for America and even Bucknell
this song was met with Boo’s and shouts of derision fill-
ed the air.

It is possible that this demonstration was aimed at the
musical abilities of the Temple Band, but more probably
it was made against the President-Elect. It is indeed un-
fortunate when those who call themselves Americans give
every evidence of being barbarians. Nobody likes to lose,
ever, but the Bucknellian hopes that the students of Buck-
nell are first Americans and then partisans. If they are
not, as seems to be the case, the hopes of America are few.
Everyone of us has a responsibility to this country, and
respecting its chief officer is one way of fulfilling this re-
sponsibility.

Service with a Sheet

The Bucknell Student Handbook lists a “Laundry Ser-
vice,” which is compulsory for all students. But, what
Bucknellians have been compelled to subscribe to seems
to be anything but service! The old phrase “Service with
a smile,” and the accompanying connotation of a willing-
ness to accommodate customers, seems to be completely
beyond the comprehension of the Merit Laundry Com-
pany.

For instance, the times set up for linen exchange are
rather restrictive. If you are unable to take your linen to
the exchange point at the prescribed time, you incur the
wrath of Merit’s representative the following week be-
cause you have failed to “exchange your linens every
week—-soiled or not.”

The exchange of linens requires other exactness, too.
For example, be sure the pieces of your “unit” are neatly
folded and piled in the right order, or they may not be
accepted by the linen exchange worker. He may even
shove the whole pile on the floor and grunt something to
you about refolding them.

It used to be so convenient to have linens delivered to
your room each week. But now, students not only have
to carry their soiled linens to an exchange point, but they
also run the risk of having their “unit” stolen. The Uni-
versity laundry performed another small, yet important,
service; they welcomed students back each fall by making
their beds for them before they arrived. Now if students
arrive after Merit Laundry closing hours they are forced
to sleep without sheets their first night on campus. Head
residents do have an extra unit on hand, but this is little
help to the second or third latecomer.

If Merit Laundry is interested in deserving the title
Service for its commodity, the least it can do is: (1) ex-
tend exchange hours; (2) devise a less time-consuming
system of exchange (such as a “de-assembly” line where
the student files past the laundry bins and deposits each
piece of his own soiled unit, and is then handed a new
unit); (3) encourage its adult employees to assume a more
courteous attitude.

Letter from London

|by Wm. Jay Jacobson II, BU ‘62
|London: Thurs., Nov. 10, 1960:
| The highlight of yesterday’s
| American Colony in London was
a gathering at the swank Hotel
Savoy, which started the night
lnerare last and ended early yes-
|terday morning, with the news
| that Senator John Fitzgerald Ken-
y was the next President of
| the United States of America.
| England could not have shown
{more interest in the election had
jit been her own.

| the
‘of the election reached a
tion point Tuesday, and the din-
iner at the Savoy marked the
‘climax of the: most exciting |
| American news London has had|/
in years.

| Subsciipition Dinner

|

It all started when the Ameri-|

|can Association of Correspondents

| scription dinner at four Guineas

ean election returns come in. Mr.

| dor in London, invited as a guest, |

included all you could eat (and
drink) while the election results
flashed on a massive board sur-
mounted by posters of candidates
Nixon and Kennedy. Kennedy
supporters were by far in the ma-
jority, but by 2 a. m. yesterday |
morning, when Kennedy was |
seemingly ahead, his supporters
were overheard saying that the
lead was not enough.
Few Nixonites

Everyone present seemed to re-
ject an earlier electronic comput-
er’s opinon which forecast a vic-
tory for Nixon. There were very
few Nixonites present, and apart

from the Ambassador, Mr. Whit- |

ney, none were particularly dem-
onstrative. The crowd became
increasingly nervous as the night
went on, and by breakfast time—
2:30 in the morning, many of the
people present started to leave.!

morning, when “intimations of

ion, and newspaper coverage of |

|a head ($11.76) to see the Ameri- |

immortality” for the senator from
Massachusetts began to filter
through the radio static, there was
still little certainty.

One regrettable result of the
| election will be the departure of
extremely popular Jock Whitney
from London, now that Kennedy
is firmly entrenched in his role as
President-Elect, but aside from
|this small disappointment, the
consensus here in Britain seemed
| to be that Kennedy was the right
man for the job.

Supports Kennedy

The Guardian, published in
Manchester, found
lelection “a tribute to his own
hard work and energy” and -call-
ed Kennedy “the only man in the
United States” who could run the
risk of “recognizing Communist
China and advocating that she
should be admitted to the United
Nations...” The traditionally
conservative London Times said
that Kennedy’s election was “gen-
erally welcomed throughout the
; world .. .” and has greeted the
election “with open approval.”
| The ‘Manchester Daily Mirror,
a paper -with one of the largest
| circulations in the world (almost
‘five million) viewed Kennedy’s
election cheerfully “after Ike’s
pathetic doddering” and called
Kennedy a “man of vigour” and
intellectual achievement.

Indeed, the general concensus
here in London and certainly at
\the University of Manchester,
where this correspondent is a stu-
dent, is that while Stevenson
would have made a better. Presi-
dent than either Kennedy or
Nixon, Kennedy will make an
excellent President and the
British people welcome him
wholeheartedly.

Submarine Base

This result is very refreshing,
[because there has been a great
deal of indignation here in Eng-
| land because of recent agreements
| to create a Polaris Missile Sub-
marine base near Holy Loch, in
Scotland. While Hugh Gaitskell.
Labour Party leader, has backed
Mr. MacMillan’s decision in this

respect, the Scottish Labour
; Unions are fighting it strongly,
and resent this United States in-
trusion on their rights.

It is indeed a desirable thing to
|be well descended, but the glory
belongs te our ancestors. -

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

Editor:

Tt is curious to me that Bruce
Bonta, whose reporting seems
usually to be accurate as well as
interesting, should make such a
gross error in reviewing the book-
let entitled The Idea of the Uni-
versity in last week’s Bucknellian.

I quote from his review: “After
noting mediating views of these
two main positions, Dr. Sturm’s
syllabus presents the third prin-
ciple argument—that education
should strengthen the moral char-
acter of the students. A variation
of the moral view (the Christian
viewpoint) concludes the first sec-
tion of the inquiry.”

On the other hand, I quote from
the booklet: “This (referring to
the preceding quotation in the
booklet) would seem to identify
the Christian view of the univer-
sity with the position that es-
pouses the cultivation of the in-
tellect as the purpose of higher
education.” (p. 9). There fol-
low quotations from Jerald
Brauer and Jacques Maritain in
support of this hypothesis.

Indeed, I myself would argue
that the - intellectualist under-
standing of the nature and pur-
pose of the university (that it
exists for the pursuit of the truth)
is integral to the Christian under-
standing of the nature of man.
This same point was expressed
by Dr. Schubert Ogden and
Father Victor Yanitelli at the
Monday evening sesson of the Re-
ligion-in-Life program.

Douglas Sturm

To the President
Bucknell University
Dear sir:

Commendations are in order for
a group of unknown Bucknell
students!

On Saturday afternoon three
young men engaged in sport ac-
tivities alerted the occupants of a
home on Brown Street which was
being threatened by fire. They
carried out furniture until smoke
fumes prevented further effort
and moved two automobiles from
the danger area.

For this and other assistance
by the student body in the past
our community can be ever grate-
ful.

Sincerely.

Following Up
The Al Incident

October 24, 1960

The following resolution was
| adopted by the Faculty of Buck-
nell University on May 4, 1960,
after a thorough discussion of the
incident of April 27, 1960. The
Secretary of the faculty sent
resolution not only to the State
Liquor Control Board, in Harris-
burg, but also to the office of the
Civil Rights Division, Department
of Justice, Commonwealth of
Philadelphia. A petition of com-
plaint, inaugurated by Mr. David
Slifer of the Class of 1960, and
signed by both students and mem-
bers of the faculty, was tlso sent
to both of these state offices.

The alleged case of racial dis-
crimination could not be dealt
with by the State Liquor Control
Board because this agency has no
jurisdiction over matters of this
kind, its functions being limited
strictly to licensing the sale of
liquors and malt beverages. Ap-
propriate action has been taken,
however, by the Civil Rights Di-

vision of the Department of Jus-
tice.

The Resolution .

Adopted by the Faculty of
Bucknell University, May 4, 1960:

Because the Faculty of Buck-
nell University deplores discrim-
ination ,against a person for rea-
sons of race, color or creed, it is
hereby resolved that the Secre-
tary be instructed to request in
the name of the Faculty that the
State Liquor Control Board in-
vestigate an alleged ease of racial
discrimination on the of the

search Program is 21, Dr. J./chairman of the department of
Charles Jones, director of the pro- | psychology at. Bucknell and co-

gram, has announced.

Among the variety of studies ,
being conducted are in-service.
programs for teachers, special |
study programs for gifted stu-
dents, and consultant programs
undertaken with the cooperation
of school principals and other
school officials interested in the
continued development of indi-

vidual educational systems. {
In-Service Training Programs

Three in-service training pro-'
grams have been introduced at
Bucknell for the first time this|
season. Under the sponsorship |
of the National Defense Education |
Act, teachers are attending classes
in mathematics, science and)
foreign language on a strictly
voluntary basis in order to in-
crease their own knowledge of a
subject and to ultimately improve
their effectiveness as teachers.
The foreign language program in
French is particularly significant
since it is the only one sponsored
by NDEA presently being offered
to elementary school teachers
anywhere, according to Dr. J.;
William Moore, associate director
of the Upper Susquehanna Valley
Program.

Nongraded Primary Program

Another project which is creat-
ing a great deal of interest among
educators is the nongraded pri-
mary program, being conducted in
Shamokin, Pa., under the direction
of Dr. Maurie Hillson, associate
professor of education at Buck-
nell. Although similar grams
which eliminate grade ifica-
tions for pupils enrolled in the
first three years of clementary
training are being carried out in
various sections of the country,
the program in Shamokin is the
only one established to provide a
scientific test of the validity of
assumptions underlining the pro-
grams adopted elsewhere on an
experimental basis.

Of the 21 different programs
being presented this year, seven
are in the area of the sciences and |
four in mathematics; there are
two each in English and French,
while the remaining programs,

won the New York Film Critics’

,Award for best foreign film in

1950.

The story tells of a stubborn
provincial peasant who loves his
trees so well that when he sells

and the money, despite the con-
sternation of the villagers.

Headley Announces |
Curriculum Change

Dr. Russell A. Headley, chair- |
man of the department of eco- |
nomics and business administra- |

_ tion, announced that a reorganiz-

|
ed curriculum in business admin- |
istration has been adopted by the
University. This program was
prompted by a grant of $25,000,
from the Ford Foundation. i
The new curriculum covers ac-
counting, business administration,
and economics, and __ stresses
thought processes rather. than}
particularized subject matter. In)
addition to required economics
and __ business administration
courses, the program emphasizes |
work in mathematics, logic, and}
in the behavioral sciences. Dr.}
Headley expressed hope that this |
new step in teaching thought pro- \
cesses will develop into “an out-
standing undergraduate program |
in business administration un-_
equalled anywhere.”

HOW TO BEAT THE BEAT GENERATION

My cousin Herkie Nylet is a sturdy lad of nineteen summers
who has, we all believed until recently, a lively intelligence and

an assured future. Herkie’s father, Walter O. Nylet, is as every-

one knows, president of the First National Artificial Cherry
Company, world’s largest maker of artificial cherries for ladies’
hats. Uncle Walter had great plans for Herkie. Last year he
sent Herkie to the Maryland College of Humanities, Sciences,
_and Artificial Cherries, and he intended, upon Herkie’s gradu-
ation, to find him a nice fat wifé and take him into the firm as
a full partner.

Could a young man have more pleasing prospects? Of course
not. But a couple of months ago, to everyone’s consternation,
Herkie announced that he was not going into the artificial cherry
business. Nor was he going to stay in college. “I am,” said
Herkie, “a member of the Beat Generation. I am going to San
Francisco and grow a beard.”

Well sir, you can imagine the commotion in the family when
Herkie went traipsing off to San Francisco! Uncle Walter would
have gone after him and dragged him home, but unfortunately
he was right in the middle of the artificial cherry season. Aunt
Thelma couldn’t go either because of her old leg trouble. (One
of her legs is older than the other.)

FS a

“ Werk, how fe0u _ 4

_ Sol went. I searched San Francisco for weeks before I found
Herkie living under the counter of a Pronto Pup stand. “Herkie,
how are you?” I cried, looking distraughtly upon his tangled
beard, his corduroy jacket, his stricken eyes.

“Beat,” said Herkie.

I offered him a Marlboro and felt instantly better when he
took it because when one smokes Marlboros, one cannot be too
far removed from the world. One still has, so to speak, a hold
on the finer things of lifelike good tobacco, like easy-drawing
filtration, like settling back and getting comfortable and enjoy-
ing a full-flavored smoke. One is, despite all appearances, basi-
cally happiness-oriented, fulfillment-dlirected, pleasure-prone.

“Herkie, what are you doing with yourself?” I asked.

“T am finding myself,” he replied. “I am writing a novel in
the sand with a pointed stick. I am conrposing a fugue for
clavier and police whistle. I am sculpting in experimental ma-
terials~-like English muffins.”

“And what do you do for fun?” I asked.

“Come,” he said and took me to.a dank little night club
where men in beards and women in basic burlap sat on orange
crates and drank espresso. On a tiny stage stood a poet reciting
a free-form work of his own composition entitled Excema: The

» Story of a Boy while behind him a jazz trio played 200 chorus:
of Tin Roof Blues. 3

“Herkie,” said I, “eome home with meto theartificial cherries.”

“No,” said Herkie, so sadly I went home to tell Uncle Walter
the bad news. He was less distressed than I had feared. It seems
Uncle Walter has another son, a quiet hoy named Edvorts, about
whom he had completely forgotten, and today Edvorts is in
business with Uncle Walter and Herkie is beat in San Francisco,

and everyone is happy.

FROSH HOLDOVERS
T0 HELP B-BALL

by Ted Odenwald
With the wrestling, basketball,
and swimming squads boasting
groups of returning lettermen,

Bucknell’s 1960-61 winter sports |¥

season will begin December 1.

Having lost only one starter
from last season’s squad, basket-
ball coach Ben Kribbs has already
picked a 13-man versity squad
that includes five returning letter-
men. Seniors, Dave Evans and
Bruce Babich, and juniors, Mike
Fadden, Don Lampus, and Joe
Steiner are the returning letter-
men. Babich, Steiner, and Fad-
den were regular starters last sea-
son while Evans and Lampus al-
ternated in starting positions.
Coach Kribbs has high hopés for
Dick Kniffin, who served two
years in the armed forces. It is
hoped that Dick can take over the
position vacated by last season’s
captain, Tom Thompson.

The Bison’s~ reserve strength
will consist of two seniors and
five sophomores. The _ seniors,
Mike Kasnick and Larry Roman
have been used in reserve for the j
past two seasons. Sophomores |
Hal Smoker. Larry Magargal,
Sam Pendrose, Kevin Cooney, and
Tom Johnson have earned berths!
on the varsity squad mainly for
the abilities they demonstrated on
the freshman squad last season.

Lampus, a 6-6, 200 pound cen-
ter, is expected to be the Bison’s
big rebounder while 6-5 Joe
Steiner should be a leading scor-
er. Steiner was named to the
second team of the MAC all-star
squad.

Injuries could prove disastrous
to the Bisons this season. In prac-
tice sessions, both Fadden and
Kniffin fracutred ankles. Kniffin’s
ankle is now out of its cast, and
Dick should be ready to play in a
few weeks. Fadden, however,
will not be able to play until after
Christmas vacation.

Coach Kribbs is confident that
this is a “good squad.” He feels
that despite the rough schedule,
the squad should better its 10-11
record of last season.

Delaware Closes
Successful Season

Tomorrow afternoon \the Bison }
football team closes its 1960 sea-
son aganst the Blue Hens of Del-
aware. Decided favorites in the}
contest, the Bucknell squad will)
be hard pressed to win its first
vetory over the Hens sirfte 1951.
Delaware has a 2-5 record, the
opposite of the Bison log. They
have been shut out by Lehigh and

handed Coach Dave Nelson his
first losing season since he has
been at Delaware.

However, Bucknell has been

plagued by a raft of injuries all
year long, and it may be an
equalizing factor in the outcome.

Thespians Triumph in Difficult Play; “25° ‘Ss. Miah Calibre Recta

‘Lower Depths’ Finest C&D Production ==" "=

by Nancy Owen |
The Lower Depths, Maxim Gor-
ki’s drama about the dregs of
Russian society, was one of the
finest productions of the Bucknell
Cap and Dagger Society in recent
years. The play was obviously
well-directed: movements were
effective and the pace fast; also,
the naturalistic setting added to
the viewer’s enjoyment. The
scene was a sooty and grimy cel-
lar which looked as if a dozen
people had been daily living in it.
However, the scene was not
necessarily Russian; there was
nothing to suggest this country
except for a tarnished samovar.
Yet the viewer did not really care
about this; he was still able to
leave the theatre feeling that
nothing—love, sickness, murder,
suicide—could affect these people
for very long. A band of thieves,
prostitutes, and gamblers, they
were concerned only with day to
day existence and from where the
next drink would come.
Actresses Succeed
The women of the cast were
particularly outstanding. All were
completely relaxed and consistent
in their parts. Judith Levy was
excellent as Nastya, a pathetic
prostitute who still tried to con-
vince the others that she did have |
a true love once. Miss Levy’s
face is very expressive, and the)
emotions she felt for each of the |
other characters was apparent. |
She reached the peak of her per- |
formance in the third act when |
she moved the audience greatly
with her story of her one love. |
As Vassilisa, the evil land-lady |
who had no scruples and could}
plot the death of her husband |
without batting an eyelash, Linda!
Garrett again created a marvelous |
characterization. Her voice was |
strong and commanding, and she;
dominated the scenes in which |
she appeared. The audience dis-}
liked Vassilisa from the moment
she first appeared on the stage.
Ellen Headley, a familiar figure |
on the Bucknell stage, turned in}
a fine portrayal of Natasha, Vas- |
silisa’s younger sister who was |
afraid to trust anyone. Miss;
Headley was convincing through- |
out the play, and her hysteria, |
after being brutally beaten, held |
the audience’s attention in the}
most powerful scene of the play.
Two freshmen, Catherine Olerio |
and Linda Tamblyn, have a place |
in future Cap and Dagger produc-
tions. Miss Olerio was charming

It’s easy to feel that way when
you can’t seem to get ahead of
financial woes. But, things prob-
ably aren't as bad as they seem.
A good way to begin your finan-

surance. And a good time to
begin is now, when you'll profit
by lower premiums. Many new

attractive to college students,
deserve your consideration.

as Kvashnya, the market women.
Her:'sense of the comic came
through admirably. Miss Tamb-
lyn, as Anna—a sick woman who
eventually dies, was convincing
and quite good.

Men Weaker

For the most part, the men of
the cast were weaker than the
women.

Joe Lo Grippo, as Bubnoff, a
furrier who left his home because
of his wife and her lover, was ex-
cellent.. He looked as if he had
always been a part of The Lower
Depths, and he was relaxed at all
times.

As Satine, a grade-A gambler,
John Wilson often became too
concerned with movement and
thus lost some of his effectiveness.
The action of his hands was repe-
titious, and his gestures were the
same no matter what the situa-
tion. Especially noticeable was
his leaping about from bunk to
floor and back to bunk again.
However, Mr. Wilson delivered
his speeches with authority and
conviction, and his conception of
Satine was apparent to the audi-
ence.

What, no sports car cap?

You don’t need a little cap with a belt in the back, or
knowledge of some esoteric automotive jargon to enjoy

a Corvette. All you need is a desire to own a car that is designed for your use personally. This is no station
wagon, no family sedan, this is your car and nobody else’s. It is the ultimate development of a fine car that
has known five years of unparalleled success in the maelstrom of sports car competition, and yet it can be
tailored to your personal tastes—even if you don’t know a tappet from a teapot.

Push-button door handles, inside door locks and a side-view mirror are some of the Corvette con-
yeniences you don’t get on most other sports cars. You also have a wide choice of power teams—ranging
from the standard 230-horsepower engine (which can be matched with Powerglide* to delight the boule-
vardier) to the swashbuckling Fuel Injection* V8 with four-speed close-ratio transmission.* Talk it over
with your dealer. Whatever version you decide on, you’re in for the greatest adventure of your driving career!

Education’! Goal

Dr. Mark Ebersole set the tone
of the third convocation of this
year’s Religion-in-Life Program
when he announced that it would
deal with the extent to which a
liberal education was being real-
ized at Bucknell. This included,
he said, “free and responsible in-
quiry ... seeking truth wherever
it may be found.” Three students
and three members of the faculty
participated in this discussion.

Joan Berlin ’61, speaking first,
mentioned the anti-intellectual
atmosphere which pervades Buck-
nell. She suggested that this was
caused in part by teaching meth-
ods which involve objective tests,
and by! straight lecture courses
which do nothing more than re-
iterate the book.

Dr. David Martin, Professor of
Philosophy, spoke next. He also
criticized the lack of intellectual
activity on the campus and he
suggested that one way to change
this situation might be to elim-

said that it resulted from the
overdependency of most students.
He said that, beginning in fresh-
man week, students learn to rely
on external factors to make decis-
ions for them. Calling this the
“cautious generation,” he said
that even good students are afraid
that they cannot “afford” a pro-
fessor who is reputed to mark
“hard.”

Bucknell Football Team Wins Lambert °

Bucknell University has one of
the best small college football
team in the East, according to
“Red” Blaik, Harvey Herman,
Lou Little, and Asa Bushnell, the
four-man committee who annual-
ly award the Lambert Cup to the
gridiron squad they think is tops
on the Eastern Seaboard. Gath-
ering all evidence, arguments,
pros and cons together in New
York last week, the committee
made a unanimous decision in
picking Bucknell as the best small
college team around,

JACK SAVED HIS COMPANY
ON HIS FIRST ASSIGNMENT

While Jack Trabert was in college he had
some definite career ideas. He knew what he
wanted—a job with a payoff for good judgment

With a B.S. in Business Administration from
the University of Nebraska, Jack knew he could
look in many difections. And he did. He talked _
to 20 companies. And then in August, 1957,
joined Northwestern Bell, in Omaha, Nebraska.

| His chance to show what he could do was
not long in coming. On his first assignment Jack
came up with answers that made it possible to
handle long distance calls made at night in the
Omaha area with less force and equipment than
was needed under the old system. This resulted
in a $10,000 annual saving.

‘Newton Directs

‘The Wasteland’

On Wed., Dec. 7, at 8:30 in the
University Theatre, the Actors?
Lab of Cap & Dagger will present
a faculty-student reading of T. S.
Eliot’s The Wasteland and other
poems. Mr. Christopher Newton.
director of the program, intend:
to bring out the dramatic values
of the material by presenting it
with different voices. Among
these voices will be Mr. W. E.
Messinger, Mrs. Ann. Messinger,
and Mr. Anthony Gosse.

One of the foremost modern
poems, The Wasteland’s power
may also be suggested’ in musica}
terms. In Wednesday’s perform-
ance, musical interludes will be
included to off-set the various
episodes. . Written in the twen-
ties, the poem may be considered
a desperate comment on the life
of mid-century America. For this
reason, the performers have
chosen to dramatize the poems on
the “apron” of the University

Honors Colloquims and de-

partmental honor courses have been added to the curricu-
tum. A host of challenging professors have invaded near-
ly every department, shoving the level of academic work
to new heights. In general, a sincere and fairly effective
effort has been made to make Bucknell a first rate school.

Students have been faced with conflicts: between people
and studies; between studies and extra-curricular activi-
ties. Seniors, caught in the transition, realize that the
minimum amount of work accomplished in lower class
courses is inadequate preparation for the sort of challenge
that now meets them in their final year. Freshmen and
sophomores, overwhelmed by the staggering amount and
depth of college work, are also victims of the new aca-
demic squeeze; their high schools have failed to groom
them for the jump to scholarly research.

The pressure is difficult only because we are not accus-
tomed to it. What is most important is that we are learn-
ing to think. Courses taxing our critical abilities and un-
derstanding of concepts at long last require the individual
to put his mind into his academic work, rather than mere-
ly parroting back information from texts and lectures.
Bucknell has begun to approach the academic goal, which
is the fundamental idea of a university.

There still exists one drawback to all of these efforts. |
Granted, Bucknell is not in a position to grant many |
scholarships; however, under present conditions we feel |
that the admissions office ought to make a greater effort |
to get “hungry” students for Bucknell. By “hungry” we
mean those that have some feeling and appreciation for
the opportunities offered them here. On the whole, the
average Bucknell student will fit into a certain profile.

the competition for grades between houses must

be keen too f

even the girls from Larison had put aside

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

Dear Editor:

On Tues. evening, Nov. 15, a
panel of students and faculty dis-
cussed the Idea of the University
and the prevalent anti-intellect-
ualism in our society. Dr. Par-
tridge and Dr. Martin pointed out
that the University is not the
place for vocational training; that
it is, or, should be, reserved for
the intellectual pursuit of the
truth. In connection with these
statements you expressed the
opinions that extra-curricular ac-
tivities, including intercollegiate
athletics, detracted from this goal.
Isn’t it more likely that the an-
ti-intellectual attitude has arisen
from the introduction and the
popularity of certain “vocational
type” courses. For instance, aren’t
the Pre-med, Engineering, Busi-
ness Administration, and Geology
curricular basically non-intellect-
ual? They are not searches for
the truth; they are professional
training.

However, we need medical doc-
tors, we need engineers, we need
businessmen, and we need geolo-
gists in this world, for they have
a distinct contribution to make.
True, a university should be an
open field for creative listening
and thinking, but should it not
also provide the opportunities for
us to put our creativity into prac-
tice? ' Why shouldn’t there be
student government organizations
to help develop our society’s lead-
ers, for certainly leadership is
needed? As Frank Wood said,
we need a place to test our wings.
Instead of reiterating the popular
ery of “over-organization,” why
don’t you offer constructive criti-
cism?

_ As was pointed out, anti-intel-
lectualism is not unique to Buck-
nell University, but is common to
our society. So is over-organiza-
tion. Boys don’t play sand-lot

Little League, etc.

My point is that there is good
in these organizations. Why not
apply our creative thinking to re-
organizing and offering advice,
instead of abolishment?
Sincerely,

Robert A. Scott

difficulty with which students liv-

stated as one reason why their
total is relatively low.

A division similar to that be-
tween freshmen and upperclass-
men occurred between the men

Remembering that all dorms vary
in number of residénts, note that
Larison, Harris, Hunt, Kress, and
Swartz each gave between $230
and $295. Roberts and East Col-
lege reported lower totals, and
women’s houses, especially fresh-
men houses, reported relatively
high totals.

Ranking high among the fresh-
men houses were Stephens
($80.50), Carey ($67.55), and Leiser
($54.00). Walker ($56.00), French
($48.50), and Hulley ($34.00) were
the upperclass houses having the
highest totals. Of the fraternities,
DU reported the highest total
($92.00), and ‘SPE ($46.80) and
SAE ($39.00) ranked second and

“THE INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT OF
‘NED FUTTY”

Chloe MeFeeters was a beautiful coed who majored in psychol-
ogy and worked in the I.Q. testing department of the University.
She worked there because she loved and admired intelligence
aboveall things. “Ilove and admire intelligence above all things”
is the way she put it.

Ned Futty, on the other hand, Wag a man who could take
intelligence or leave it alone. What he loved and admired above
all things was girls. ‘What I love and admire above all things
is girls” is the way he put it.

One day Ned saw Chloe on campus and was instantly smitten.
“Excuse me, miss,” he said, tugging at his forelock. “Will you
marry me?”

She looked at his duck-tail haircut, his black-rimmed glasses,
his two-day beard, his grimy T-shirt, his tattered jeans, his de~
composing tennis shoes. “You are not unattractive,” she ad-
mitted, “but for me beauty is not enough. Intelligence is what
I’m looking for. Come to the I.Q. testing department with me.”

“Of course, my tiger,” cried Ned and giggled and smote his

“First, I will test your vocabulary,” said Chloe.

“Be my guest,” laughed Ned and licked her palm.

“What does juxtaposition mean?”

her clavicle.

“Furtive?”

“With fur on?” said Ned doubtfully.

“Oh, Ned Futty,” said Chloe, “‘you are dumb. Consequently
I cannot be your girl because I love and admire intelligence
above all things.” ‘

He flung himself on the floor and clasped her ankles. “But I
love you,”’ he cried in anguish. “Do not send me from you or
you will make the world a sunless place, full of dim and
fearful shapes.”

“Go,” she said coldly.

Lorn and mute, he made his painful way to the door. There
he stopped and lit a cigarette. Then he opened the door and
started away to his gray and grisly future.

“Stay!” called Chloe. -

He turned.

“Was that,” she asked, “a Marlboro you just lit?”

“Yes,” he said.

“Then come to me and be my love,” cried Chloe joyously.

(Continued from Page 1)

and both games could have been
won as easily as they were lost.
Better officiating at Cornell, and
half a break in the last minute at
Rutgers would have meant an un-
defeated season.

Paul Terhes did a wonderful
job for Bucknell this year, but the
success of the team can not rest
on his shoulders alone. Paul was
widely recognized for his passing
prowess, and received an armful
of rewards during and after the
season for his work. He. was
named All-East quarterback two
weeks in a row. He also received

the Maxwell Award, given by the!

has been named to several “All
teams, including one third string
All-American team. He was the
only player from a small school
named on that squad.
Turk’s Bowl Invitations

He is unquestionably the out-
standing quarterback in the Con-
ference and probably the best in
small colleges throughout the
country. Turk has also been of-
fered a couple of senior Bow] in-
vitations, and will definitely be

in Tuscon, Arizona, December 26. |

While it was his arm that carried
the squad at times, there was an-
other factor which contributed
mightily to Bucknell’s
Defense.

Right from the first game, the |

Bison defense took a _ beating.
Don Chaump was the first in a
long string of injuries, which
eventually knocked four players
out for the season. But hard-
nosed and aggressive, the Buck-
nell line continued to play: out-.
standing ball, allowing only one
touchdown a game or 59 points
for the season. The Bisons scored
45 points in the first four games,
38 against major colleges. MAC
competition was held to five
points a contest. Rutgers, a joke
in the conference, they’re so big,
tallied 23 points of the 36 scored
against the Bisons in MAC play.
Of course, you can do anything
with figures, but an actual view
of a Bucknell game gave some in-
dication of the rough play of the
line. Time and again, opposing

players were sent to the sidelines, |

some permanently. Fumbles and
interceptions were well into the

double figures, all caused by the!

hard charging Bison line.
Chuckles Plays Big Part
While everyone who had a hand
in the defensive work this season
deserves credit, the real honor
should go to the work horses of
the team, the winners of the
“Chuckles Ax-Murder” Award.
Ron Maslanik, Ash Ditka, Tom
Alexander, Kirk Foulke, Tom
Noteware, and Dean Stump.
Foulke was the only one that
made it through. the season un-
hampered, and was_ presented
with the award twice. For the
others, if they weren’t injured,

the games were physical torture}

anyway, by virtue of old fashion-
ed aches and pains received from
being in on nearly every play,
Ditka, Foulke, and Stump were
all honored by being placed on
weekly All-East teams.
Unsung Heroes

All the above factors influenc-
ed the committee’s choice of
Bucknell as the Lambert Cup
winner, but there were other fac-
tors which had a great. deal of
influence on several victories.
Take the unsung heroes, Ken
Twiford, who banged into the line
all season for three and four yards
and yet was never slated as a
star. John Aucker and Bob Wil-
liams, who played as rough a
game of football as anyone out
there, were seldom mentioned.
Aches and bruises are a small
reward for four months of work.

Several sophomores played an
important part in Bison wins.
Dick Tyrrell literally came out of
nowhere to be recognized as one
of the best ends in the MAC.
Dick Johnson made some spark-
ling open field runs this year,
which have been a rarity in the
past. Chuck Johnson, Ron Ho-
howski and Dick Orlowski all fill-
ed in nicely near the end of the
season when half the line was
out of action. This great team
effort gave Bucknell the Lambert
Cup.

BISON ALL-AMERICAN PAULTERHES

Foulke Elected
Football Captain

Kirk Foulke was named captain
of the 1961 Bucknell football

' squad at the program honoring

- colade, the Lambert Cup.

on the eastern, small college All-
American team. This is the second
consecutive year that he has been
chosen for this coveted honor.
The Associated “Press recently
published their All East team.
Ten of the 11 positions were filled
by major college “stars” (one of
them being the much publicized
Joe Bellino of Navy). The quar-
terback was Paul Terhes. The
New York Daily News also elect-
ed him to their All East team.
The Newspaper Enterprise As-
sociation just announced their
three All-American football
teams. These 33 players repre-
sent the best in the entire coun-
try, small and large college alike.
Paul was elected to the third
team. Maybe Turk isn’t one of
the three best quarterbacks in the
nation, but those that-have seen
him perform would hardly con-
test this decision, and the profes-
sional football scouts have been
casting long looks in his direction.
On December 26, Turk will be
playing in his last college football
It is the third annual All-
American Bowl game, pitting
the small college All-Americans
against their major college coun-

| terparts.

‘Bucknell led the league in pass-

points scored. On defense, the
Bisons led the league by allowing
only 155 total yards and six points
per game, and in pass intercep-

Coach Odell expressed regrets
that he would be losing seven
seniors but was quite thankful

that the number of graduates was |

not larger. The seniors are Cap-

|stymied all attempts by Bucknell
|to work an offense. Co-Captain
Joe Steiner gave Bison rooters
|something to cheer about, how-
ever, as he racked up 25 points,
| while pulling down 19 rebounds.

Trailing by 15 midway through
the second half, Gettysburg initi-
jated the press, which proved to
be extremely effective. Six quick
|points, a bueket by the home
squad, and six more by the visi-
tors cut Bucknell’s lead to five
points. Sophomore guard Sam
Penrose then poured in two
| straight baskets and the situation
jwas temporarily under control.

Bison fortunes on the wane.

Bucknell fans got their first

{were immediately impressed by

cently returned from the service,
Kniffin collected 12 points in the
first half. In the second stanza,

| Ron Warner, 13-17 from the foul
line, closed out the scoring

A tremendous shooting percent-

second half accounted for the Bul-
lets upsurge. Hemsing and Park-
er poured in 27 points. Parker
finished the night with 11 field
goals and three foul shots for 25

RUTGERS PREVIEW

Five returning starters, good
reserve strength and a number of
fine sophomores could add up to

Rutgers’ first winning basketball | ©

season since 1948-49. That’s the
opinion of Coach Toni Kuolt and
his players as they prepare for
their opener with Glassboro State
here Thursday night (Dec. 1).

“We'll be going into every game |,

on our schedule with a chance to
win it,” said Kuolt, who is begin-
ning his second season as a head
coach. “I’m hoping that we can
get off to a good start against our |
rugged early season opponents.”

Kuolt’s optimism is tempered
by some problems, but the out-
jook appears to be the brightest;
for a Scarlet team in many years.

Rutgers will have no real big
man, but will possess good overall
height. The shooting should be
improved over last year, accord-
ing to Kuolt, and the defense is
“adequate.”

Heading the list of returning @

starters is Captain Doug Patton

of Red Bank, a 5-10 guard who fee

established one-season Rutgers
scoring and field goal records last
year. Patton scored 495 points
for a 19.8 average.

Al Ammerman,

a 6-1 junior

# ions.

from Berwyn, Pa., joins Pattonin §

the backcourt and Lee, Al’s 6-4
brother, is the center. Al aver-
aged 14.1 points a game as a
sophomore to rank second to Pat-
ton. Lee was the team’s top re-
bounder and was third in scoring.
The forwards are Karol Stre-
lecki of Bethlehem, Pa. and Joel
Osofsky of Bayonne. Strelecki,a
6-6 senior, led the team in scoring |
as a sophomore but was hamper-
ed by injuries last year and show- |
ed only flashes of his top form. |
Osofsky, a 6-4 junior, developed |
during the season to nail down a!
starting spot. |
Guard Fred Homer, a 6-1 senior |
from West Hempstead, N. Y.,.is a.
sixth letter-winner back from last
year and should see considerable |
duty along with forward Bob!
Strong, a 6-3 junior from Kings- |
ton, N. Y. who did not play in|
1959-60. |
Rutgers appears to have more |
starting talent and overall depth |
than at any time in recent years. |
Whether or not this is the season |
for the long-coveted winning rec- |
ord should be more apparent by |
the Christmas recess. |

Joe Steiner, co-captain of the
basketball team will carry the
load on the boards tomorrow ,
night against Rutgers.

Work Camp Invades
Philadelphia Slums

by Marta Fortman & Kate Kelly

The slums of Philadelphia cone |
trasted sharply with our sheltered |
Bucknell life when we lived and
worked at a Friend’s Work Camp
for a weekend. The purpose of}
the camp was twofold: to ac-
quaint high school and college}
students with the social problem
of slums and to provide a way
to improve the corditions of this |
segment of our society. Our head-
quarters agd “hotel” was a house
located in the center of the slum |
area, where we slept rolled up in
blankets on Army surplus mat-
tresses.

Rooms Painted

Our project was to paint two
rooms in a young negro woman’s
shabby “band box” (a three story
apartment of three rooms averag-
ing about $65 rent per month).
When we arrived at Mrs. Pleas-
ant’s door complete with step lad-
ders, paint buckets, plastering
equipment, and Bucknell sweat-
shirts, we were impressed by her
friendliness.

Mrs. Pleasant and her seven
children were supported by relief
funds, and so we were surprised
to find a large and new television
set in the midst of her dingy liv-;
ing room. However, upon com-
paring notes with the other work
crews, we found that television is

an escape device for these people feeling which is built up during a match. Through just the slightest
hint of what is occuring, the audience senses what is happening.

and, as such, is a necessity.

ON MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT”

“| ENGINEERED MICROWAVE TOWER LOCATIONS

J

When Bill Pigott knocked on the door of
Pacific Telephone, he had two big assets. One
was an electrical engineering degree from Seattle
University. The other was a craving to jump
right into vital engineering problems.

Other important assignments followed: engi-
neering maritime radio systems, SAGE systems
—figuring engineering costs for Air Force Titan
missile bases.

“Our people respect a man’s engineering
training—you really get a chance to show what
you’ve got on the ball,’’ Bill says. ‘I was up to
my neck in tough engineering problems right
from the start.”

If you want a job where you put your training
to work from the day you hang up your hat—you'll
want to visit your Placement Office for literature
and additional information.

It was not long before Bill was exploring
Washington’s rugged Cascade Range in a heli-
copter to find sites for microwave relay towers
—part of a multimillion dollar telephone con-
struction job. Today, it’s considerable satisfac-
tion to him to see these towers spanning the
mountains, knowing that his planning helped
put them there.:

“Our number one aim is to have im all
management jobs the most vital, intelli-
gent, positive and imaginative men we
can possibly find.” aw

Dependent, Who Me?

In the beginning, Bucknell provides each freshman
with a counselor. And in his senior year, each recipient
still clings to every weed sprouting from the cliff of an in-
creasingly complex life.

It’s not that freshmen should not have counselors. On
the contrary, for counselors are essential in easing the ad-
justment from high school to college. This adjustment
is becoming increasingly difficult with the “academic
squeeze” as yet uneased by proper high school prepara-
tion. Moreover, the men counselors are invaluable in re-
taining the roofs of Swartz and Kress Halls on weekends.
The women counselors lend advice about social situations
and encourage an academic approach.

These ends are appropriate. Would that they were
merely fulfilled. Instead, counselors serve as built-in tu-
toring services, theme punctuators and quiz kids. They
run handy dating bureaus and maintain verbal “dear
Abby” columns. The counselor’s door is always open; the
barest semblance of problems are played upon the coun-
selor’s ear and are most frequently solved by that oracle
extraordinaire!

We do not condemn the dormitory counseling system;
we merely lament the overplaying of its role. Although
it varies with individuals, we feel that freshman depend-
ence upon counselors is merely a reflection of an attitude
permeating all aspects of Bucknell life.

Several years ago, the students rejected an academic
honor system because they felt themselves incapable of
handling the responsibility of individual honesty on ex-
aminations. Since then, the cheating problem has in-
creased in scope and seriousness. Thus, we have foisted
onto professors a responsibility which is ours.

Last year, the women students dissolved their social
honor system, having proved that they were unable to
live without falling back on some method of group en-
forcement. Today, they have that enforcement which, in
many cases, fails to function properly because council as-
sistants are afraid to accept the duty of reporting another
woman’s violation.

Compulsory attendance at classes, rather than unlimit-
ed cuts is another instance of student dependence upon
enforced regulations. Professors, on the basis of past ex-
perience, do not feel that students are disciplined enough
to regulate their own class attendance. The fact that the
administration requires an attendance record for each
class further emphasizes the lack of trust in students.

Those courses allowing independent study are intoler-
ably few. For most students, the nearest approach to
scholarly research is a surface-scraping term paper con-
sisting of a collection of footnoted quotations. Seldom are
we required to exercise our critical abilities; when we
must, we find ourselves floundering in a sea with which
we are not prepared to cope.

Dependency is‘an attitude fostered in the home. ‘How
sad we do not have the opportunity to find our own hand-
holds, even in our universities.

Whee! Whoopie!

Yep, the Christmas season has arrived
in strange and telling ways from the extravagant decorations
in our fair city, Lewisburg to the university donated X-mas
trees in our dorms everywhere i
look i can see the true spirit of X-mas oozing from every
symbolic decoration take for
example the exquisitely beautiful tree which
dominates Taylor Street living room, wow what a tree—
then there’s the truly moving
.old-testament type santaclaus which graces
the stately lobby of hunt how it warms my sentimental
mouse heart
the most interesting of all
is the truly devout set of seasonal
door decorations
which so perfectly decorate the doors of Hully house rooms
and the symbolically decorated
tree which graced Harris last week—how they echo
the bucknellians spirits in this glorious season
all we lack now and wont for long is
those X-mas formals fraternity greens which
remind us strangely of the bushes on the odgers mansion
or a lewisburgian backyard pine-patch
how kind the powersthatbe must be
to donate all this stuff to we!
And may the girls of Hulley House
bring Christmas near to girls and mouse,
with X-mas pageants oh so dear
bringing X-mas spirit here.

Mitchell Shows
War Paintings

Bruce Mitchell, Bucknell Uni-
versity’s artist-in-residence, has
been notified that his war paint-
ings, along with those of other
artists who served as correspond-
ents for Life magazine during
World War II, will be placed on
permanent display in the Penta-
gon.

To be presented to the Depart-
ment of Defense by the editors of
Life Wed. afternoon, Dec. 7, the
paintings will become a perma-
nent historic collection of the war
years as seen through the eyes of
Life’s war artists. About 300
paintings by 12 artists will be
placed on public view. Mr.
Mitchell expeets to attend the
presentation ceremony.

Considered one of the most out- |
standing collections of its kind,
Life, in a special issue devoted to
the war paintings in 1945, said—
“Nothing could show more dra-
matically than these paintings
how completely the Americans,
have been plunged into the whole
wide world.”

One of the far-flung places
where the American G. I. was
sent was Iran. It was from there
that Bruce Mitchell captured the’
work and experiences of the
members of the Persian Gulf
Command in his paintings. Trans-
porting five million tons of Amer-
ican. supplies “from dockless coast
across roadless desert and moun-
tain” was the major objective of
the servicemen in that area of the
globe, and Mr. Mitchell’s paint-
ings provide a living and dramatic
insight into a major military op-
eration which helped Russia win
her battle against the Nazi invad-
ers.

ganization initiated by students
at the University of Michigan, has
two goals: to urge the United
States Government to expand our
Foreign Service, and to work ac-
tively towards an expansion of
the International Civil Service of
the United Nations.

The organization is a response
by students to speeches made on
Michigan’s campus by Senators
John Kennedy ‘and _ Chester
Bowles earlier this year. In these
speeches the Senators challenged
members of the academic com-
munity to contribute their talents
to aiding the developing countries
of the world.

developing countries which ask
for our assistance.

Bisons Edge
Rutgers, 58-55

With two seconds left to play
in one of the’ most dramatic bas-
ketball games ever played by BU,
co-captain Joe Steiner batted
down a desperation shot by Rut-
gers’ Doug Patton to preserve a
slim 58-55 victory over the Scarlet
Knights. The game was played
before a capacity crowd at the
Rutgers gym in New Brunswick.

As a result of four early fouls
committed by co-captain Dick
Kniffin, Steiner was forced to
carry the team’s offensive threat,
and he came through with 28
points. Kniffin finished the game
with 11 points. Joel Osofsky was
high man for Rutgers with 14
points.

Osofsky started Rutgers off to
a 2-0 lead with a jump-shot from
the foul line. After a foul-shot
by Don Lampus, Kniffin’s long
jumper put Bucknell ahead 3-2,
as the lead see-sawed back and
forth until Bucknell opened up
a 12 point advantage with 11:30
left in the first half. The lead
was gradually whittled down
until, with five: minutes left in
half, Rutgers took the lead on a
jump-shot by 6-6 Karol Strelecki.
At halftime, Rutgers led by aslim
two point margin, 30-28.

After employing a tight man-
to-man defense in the first half,
the Bisons switched to a 3-2 zone
at the start of the second half.
Sparked by Mike Kasnick’s excel- |
jent floor play and Joe Steiner’s |
shooting, Bucknell took over the}
lead and moved out to a seven-
point edge with 12 minutes left in
the game. With only 2:16 remain-
ing to be played, BU had extend-
ed this advantage to nine points

Sports Illustrated’

Sports Illustrated’s Special Bas- |

bonanza for the basketball buff. |
The magazine devotes 27 pages to|
scouting reports on 180 college}
teams, four pages to a color Spec- |
tacle on Carolina’s Dixie Classic |
and eight pages to an instruction- |
al article entitled The Secret of a)

ing reports are divided into con- |
ference groups. Each team and

individual player prospects are

covered, and last year’s records

are included. in the background

information.

In the Ivy League, Sports Ilus-
trated finds Princeton the logical
choice for favorite. The squad is
deep and though it lacks size and
speed it has consistent man-to-
man defense. In the Mid-Atlantic
Conference, the strongest in the
East, St. Joseph’s seems to be out
in front, but LaSalle and Temple
are credited with good possibili-
ties.

Yn the Yankee race there is
trouble ahead for Connecticut,
with Maine cited as the team most
likely to exploit Conn’s lack of
size and experience this year.
Rhode Island’s team this year is
rated the best in Coach Ernie Cal-
verley’s career at his alma mater |
and the scouting reports say it
may challenge the leaders.

Independents

Among the Independents, Provi-
dence is expected to be up in
front again, in the East, St. Bona-
venture promises to hold its own
with Tom Stith shooting, and
NYU is taking on the best and is
predicted to be right up there too. |

INTRAMURAL STANDINGS

Co-captain Dick Kniffin connects on jump-shot in last Friday's ' SPE

loss to Gettysburg.

Kniffin Explains Basketball Adjustment

Returning to Bucknell after
three years in the Armed Ser-
vices, Dick Kniffin is making the
“tough adjustment” from Army
basketball to college basketball.

A graduate of Dumont High
School, Dumont, New Jersey,
Dick came to Bucknell in 1955.
In the summer of 1957, he joined
the Army, serving two years in
San Francisco and one year in
Korea. While in Korea in 1958-
‘59, Dick averaged between 32
and 33 points per game.

Now in his junior year, Dick is
+ co-captain of the Bison squad
weraging 14 points per game.
Jick feels that he has begun the
season rather slowly. He attrib-

es the slow start to two things:
2. chipped ankle, bone and the dif-

ference in Army and college type |

basketball.

In the second week of practice,
Dick chipped a bone in his left
ankle and was on crutches for
nearly three wee Having mis:
ed so many weeks of practice, he

Solid opportunities with solid state devices

A big part of Western Electric's job is to manu-
facture the miniature “new arts” products that
are changing the science of communications.
It’s a job which offers you a challenging career
~—a chance to plan new methods of mass pro-
ducing ever-improving kinds of transistors, fer-
rite devices, diodes, special purpose electron
tubes, etc.

You'll be with a company that is expanding
rapidly in this field. At present our Allentown
and Laureldale, Pa., plants are devoted exclu-
sively to making electron devices, and a big
new plant is under construction in Kansas
City. The needs of the Bell Telephone System
for these products are increasing daily and
will multiply enormously with the introduc-
tion of Electronic Central Office switching
now nearing trial operation.

These devices are changing the scene at all
our manufacturing plants as they go into the
startling new communications products devel-
oped by our associates at Bell Telephone
Laboratories. From microwave transmission

\

equipment to submarine cable amplifiers, our
products call for creative production engineer-
ing, installation planning, and merchandising
methods. Our job for the Bell System and the
U.S. government has grown to the point where

we are now one of the nation’s “Top 11” in -

industrial sales. And your chance to play an
important part in our future growth is solid!

events of momentous importance
throughout past centuries. Swat,
that alluring “Garden Spot of
Pakistan,” enchanted us with its
charm. Srinagar, picturesque
paradise of painter and poet, cap-

emotions. Herappa, Taxila, and

Freshman Poet Describes Typical Christmas

A TYPICAL BUCKNELL CHRISTMAS
by a typical Bucknell poet
‘ The following poem was especially composed and
presented by ‘Santa Clause’ at the Freshman Class

Christmas Formal last Saturday.

"Twas the night before Christmas and all a the

sem,

Not a creature was stirring, not even a gem.

The beer cans. were hid.in the stockings with care,

In hopes that DEAN STEVENSON wouldn’t be there.
The freshmen were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of frat parties swam through their heads.
MRS. ODGERS in her nightgown and MERLE in his cap,
Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap.

When up in the sem there arose such a clatter,

Even the squirrels wondered what was the matter.

The boys, after kidnapping the campus cop,

Were safely nestled on Larison’s rooftop.

The moon on the crest of the new-fallen snow,

Lit up DEAN MEYN, approaching below.

And what should he see as he looked up on high,

But the freshmen men rere him straight in the eye.
With a little old leader so noble and plain, ._
He knew in a moment it must be GUY PAYNE.

The boys were enacting the plans they had made,

Terrorizing the sem with a large panty-raid.

From Edwards and Leiser and Carey and Scott,

The boys had some panties, as likely as not.

The houses had fallen, but, just getting warm,
These guys had descended on Larison dorm.
Though the windows were locked’ and the doors had
‘been barred,
The boys didn’t give up, their hopes were not marred.
So up to the rooftop the fellows they flew,
Which an extension ladder helped ‘them to do.
Aroused from their slumber, the girls heard on the roof
The running around of each sneaker-clad hoof.
So they put on their robes and went into the hall,
As down the chimney the boys started to crawl.
They were all dressed in disguises, from head to foot,
And their clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
The boys from the quad wore trench coats and sneakers,

But the other contingent looked quite a bit bleaker.

They were all disguised with moustaches and warts.

Swartz.

And the girls weren’t quite sure that they came from

Their eyes had a look that meant only disaster.

Their laughs were so loud they put cracks in the plaster.

They spoke not a word but went straight to their work.

They took lots of stockings then turned with a jerk,

And taking some slips and some pants for good measure,

Ran out of the door, simply beamirig with pleasure.

They thought they had safely concluded their plot,

But GRIFF and SPIKE were outside in the lot.

The boys were stopped dead, most were scared stiff,

But their fear was'relieved when SPIK® and GRIFF,
On seeing the loot they had lifted from shelves,
Decided to take some just for themselves.

My story has ended; the results were fair,

Except some of the women had nothing to wear.
There's one thing to say of their terrible plight:
MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, and to all a good night.

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1900.

Executive Instrument?

The Bucknell Student Handbook lists the purpose of
the Student Faculty Congress as follows:

“The Student-Faculty Congress shall serve as the
supreme exetutive and legislative instrument for di-
recting student life at Bucknell University; for creat-
ing cooperation among students, faculty, and admin-
istrators; and for providing democratic student gov-
ernment in all phases of student activity, subject only
to the statutory regulations of the University. It
shall at all times be aware of and concerned with the
academic welfare of the University and the purposes
of Bucknell as an institution of higher learning.”

Few, not even those accused as being as negative as we,
would endeavor to criticize this purpose. However, our
difficulty lies in seeing how the present SFC carries out
this aim. i

It is not our purpose to judge here the past functions of
the organization; rather we are concerned only with the
present. We have seen thus far the actions of SFC in
such significant events as the organization of the Who’s
Who Election and the recommendation that the name of
the Parachute Club remain the Parachute Club at Buck-
nell University. While these functions must be handled
and probably do fall to the lot of SFC, the question must
be raised as to what else this “supreme executive and
legislative instrument” does.

We were temporarily encouraged to find upon the read-
ing of the minutes of a recent S¥C meeting that commit-
tees such as one to investigate the faculty evaluations
forms and another to investigate a uniform cut system
has been formed. However, it does seem curious that it
has taken SFC until the latter part of the first semester to
show any indication that it is indeed concerned with the
academic climate of the University. Further, we have
ceased to be impressed with the mere formations of such
committees. The key question is what are they doing?

Perhaps there have been other similar committees that
have been previously formed and have done something

itive. But if such is the case it has been our misfortune
to know nothing of their existence, no less their accom-
plishments. We did see that there were not enough mem-
bers present at the November 30 meeting to vote on the
“Academic Sub-committee Proposal,” whatever that
might be, but this evidence does little to relieve our
doubts. LS

We hope that the picture of SFC, as an organization
concerned mainly with trivials and delightful unburden-
ed with any significant accomplishments in regard to its
primary concern as listed in the Student Handbook, that
of the “academic welfare of the University,” is one falsely
drawn. :

But we do feel that an organization which is given the
power to judge the relative worth of other student organ-
izations through its allocation of funds, should be subject
to some examination itself. If this examination yields,
as it has in this case, negative results, then there is obvi-
ously something amiss. Either the fault lies in the fact
that SFC falls embarrassing short of the function it is
supposed to fill or its channels for bringing reports of its
progress to the student body are extremely inadequate.
We sincerely hope that the latter is the case, rather than
the former.

But in any case: Please SFC would you mind telling us
what evidence justifies your existence?

Quality Not Quantity!

We have recognized the “academic squeeze” which has
hit this university, along with most of its contemporaries
throughout the nation. We heartily approve the effort to
force students to put creative thought into their course
work. :

But let us examine the manner in which this academic
emphasis is being applied. Nearly every course beyond
the introductory 100 courses, and even some of those, re-
quire term papers. The result is a student pressured into
completing five or six long papers at the end of the se-
mester. x

The obvious answer to this statement is that students
should plan ahead. But how, we ask, can one keep his
head above water throughout the semester and still put
the necessary brainwork into a thoughtful paper? Stu-
dents find themselves, not of choice but of necessity,
merely skimming the surface of their papers and submit-
ting collections of footnoted or plagiarized material con-
taining few of their own ideas. _

We question the assigning of an increased work load, of
requiring quantity rather than quality. While every pro-
fessor may have the best interests of his class at heart, the
student staggers under a load of work demanded in great-
er quantity by each of his professors. —-

More students turn to fraternity and sorority files not
because they are unable to do the work but because they
haven’t enough time. We cannot help but feel that the
cheating: problem will increase, out of the head-banging

feeling caused by an overwhelming amount of work, none
of which can be done properly.

It may be argued that students must learn to make de-
cisions between extra-curricular activities, social life, and
studies. We must learn to budget more time for academic
work. At the same time, however, we must realize that
no work may be done effectively if one does not relax oc-
casionally. The human dynamo is able to run for only a
short time at its greatest speed before giving out.

Perhaps one solution to the dilemna would be a reduc-
tion of the number of courses taken in a semester, from
five to four. In this way, the quantity of academic work
may be maintained with equivalent quality. Or, we might
attempt a trimester or quarter system which allows stu-
dents to enroll in fewer courses and to do concentrated
research in each.

Whatever the solution, the student body cannot learn
effectively while laboring under the present demands in-
flicted by professors. The number of students on the
verge of nervous breakdowns within the past two weeks
is far too many for comfort. Vacations no longer serve
their purpose as breaks in the academic routines, for stu-
dents are constantly caught between the demands of as-
signments and family activities.

In order that the faculty receive the mature and crea-
tive sort of work of which their students ARE capable, we
would suggest that professors consider carefully the value
and quantity of the work which they assign.

Messenger Airs Views on ‘Amphritryon 38’

Considers Sex an Important Factor in Drama

by W. E. Messenger

Editors note: This article is
the first in a series to be writ-
fen by professors about the
play. ‘Amphitryon 38’.

James Thurber and E. B. White
ence collaborated on a book title,
Is Sex Necessary? As far as the
play Amphitryon 98 is concerned,

answer would be an unquali-
fied “yes!” Without sex, Amphi-
tryon 38 would not exist, or at
best, only its frail skeleton would
remain.

Interestingly enough, Amphi-
tryon 38, too, is a collaboration of
sorts. The number in its title}.
signifies that it is the 38th render-
ing or successive adaptation of
the original. Amphitryon 38 re-
counts the myth telling of a night
of bliss enjoyed by the divine!
Jupiter, (the Greek Zeus), in a
most pleasant—because human
and therefore for him novel—
manner.

DECK THE HALLS

The time has come to make out our Christmas shopping lists
for Christmas will be upon us quicker than you can say Jack

Robinson. (Have you ever wondered, incidentally, about. the

origin of this interesting phrase “Quicker than you can say
Jack Robinson’? Well sir, the original phrase was French—
“Plus vite que de dire Jacques Robespierre.” Jack Robinson is,
as everyone knows, an anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who
was, as everyone knows, the famous figute from the French

Revolution who, as everyone knows, got murdered in his bath

by Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Aaron Burr.

(The reason people started saying “(Quicker than you can say
Jaeques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is called in English-
speaking countries)” is quite an interesting little story. It seems
that Robespierre’s wife, Georges Sand, got word of the plot to
murder her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his
life was call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than
she could say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from
her old friend Frederic Chopin who was down in Majorca setting
lyrics to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto.” Chopin said he
needed Georges Sand’s help desperately because he could not
find a rhyme for “Warsaw.” Naturally, Georges Sand could not
refuse such an urgent request.

(Well sir, Georges Sand went traipsing off to Majorca, but
before she left she told her little daughter Walter that some bad
men were coming to murder daddy in his bath, and she in-
structed Walter to shout Robespierre’s name when the bad men
arrived. But Walter, alas, had. been sea-bathing that morning
on the Riviera, and she had come home loaded with sea shells
and salt water taffy, and when the bad men came to murder
Robespierre, Walter, alas, was chewing a big wad of salt water
taffy and could not get her mouth open in time to shout a
warning. Robespierre, alas, was murdered quicker than you
could shout Jaeques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is
called in the English-speaking countries).

(There is, Lam pleased to report, one small note of cheer in
this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca where
Chopin was setting lyrics to his immortal ‘Warsaw Concerto,”
she was happily able to help him find a rhyme for “Warsaw,”
as everyone knows who has heard those haunting lyries:

In the fair town of Warsaw,

Which Napoleon’s horse saw,

Singing cockles and mussels, ative alive of)

Yee Nip, Qe Loos

But I digress.

We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we all strive to do
at Christmas is, of course, to find unusual, offbeat, different
gifts for our friends. May I suggest then a carton of Marlboro
Cigarettes?

What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboros
as unusual, offbeat, different? You had regarded them as familiar,
reliable smokes whose excellence varied not one jot or tittle
from year to year?

True. All true. But at the same time, Mariboros are unusual,
offbeat, different, because every time you try one, it’s like the
first time. The flavor never pafls, never gets hackneyed. Each
Marlboro is a fresh delight, a pristine pleasure, and if you want
all your friends to clap their hands and exclaim, “Yes, Virginia,
there is a Santa Claus!” you will put them at the very top of
your Christmas list.

Varied Skills and Techniques
Presented at Art Exhibition

by Mike Ingraham

Art has come to Bucknell! I
can’t imagine why since our stu-
dent body is notoriously insensi-
tive, crude, and physical, but in
any case, it has come. A group
of artists called the Mid-State Ex-
hibitors consisting mostly of fac-
ulty personnel from central Penn-
sylvania colleges occupy the first
and second floors of Bertrand Li-
brary with their versatile collec-
tion.

Mrs. Sterling Strauser offers an
amazing number of tapestries
copied from the antique toys
which stand underneath her work
in the display cases. A fairly
well-known painter, Mrs. Strauser
shows, exquisite skill in weaving
and blending colors together in
painterly fashion.
best works, “Ark” and “Deves in
Flight,” exhibit this talent. The
back and foreground of the “Ark”
is alive with swirls and gyres, a
turbulent atmosphere and _ sea.
The ark, however, is composed in
solid horizontals and verticles,
lending it an extreme stability in
the midst of chaos. In “Doves in
Flight,” Mrs. Strauser directs the
movement down two bisecting
diagonals which follow the doves’
flight.

On the second floor, Daniel|the frame blends into the yellow

the contemporary trend of artists |
to move into three dimensional
representation.

Of course, the main part of the
exhibition is concerned with the
paintings which are, strangely!
enough, all oils and no water-|
colors. Bucknell’s Blanchard |
Gummo presents “Approach to;
the Quarry,” a representational |
painting, colored in dull greys and |
browns to match the subject. Ob- |
jects such as discarded tires and |
a dead tree occupy the landscape |
for proper effect.

Bucknell’s Bruce Mitchell offers
“Susquehanna Autumn” painted
from the well-known perspective
of Shikalemy lookout. Very)|
thinly painted with many areas of
pure coloring, Mr. Mitchell has |
simplified the landscape into its |
impressive components.

I was especially struck by a
work of William Foster's entitled
“Reflection on Landscape No. 2”.

homogenous blue-grey, the faint
outline of a branch of a tree is

almost completely into the pre-
valent tone. Another form is
suggested at the upper left by a
thin dribble of brown paint which
at once blends because of its color
and at the some time extends be-
cause of its thickness. A stain of

John Chandler from Lycoming
titled his work “Wreath,” a de-
lightful color scheme in which the
black that edges the perimeter of
the canvas gives way to yellow
| which goes to green and finally to
red at the center. Harsh, thin,
black lines are dispersed through-
out with white snow spots cov-
ering the complete canvass. This,
as in the preceeding painting, is
very thinly painted but relies on
different techniques to accentuate
spacial illusions. .

Another interesting work is
George Pappas’s “Window No. 2”.
The predominant form presented
is a large, black frame painted

painting, the background is white,

Eliot on the Apron
Fails in ‘Wasteland’

Review of ‘Eliot on the Apres’
by Mike Ingraham

Last week, the Actors’ Lab of
Cap & Dagger presented a par-
tially successful program entitled
Eliot on the Apron. Selectiens
|\from Old Possum’s Book of Prac-
\tical Cats, a sample of Eliet’s
| lighter verse, headed the program
{in a reading by Christopher New-
ton. Mr. Newton, who is in his

department, is a superb. reader
and a dramatist.whose dry British
‘wit and inflection lend themselves
\to a faithful interpretation of
 Eliot’s eat poems.
Accent of Music
The second part of the program,
‘however, was not quite as well
jdone. Four readers, Ann Mes-
isenger, Ellen Headley, William
| Messenger, and Anthony Goase,
| attempted a dramatized recitation
| of The Wasteland, accented by in-
| cidental piano music played and
‘arranged by Mr. Newton.
Eliot’s Wasteland is a testimony

New Yorkjof the contemporary civilization

which has forgotten its traditions,
lost its purpose and sacrificed its
moral and intellectual strength for
base trivialities. It is civilization
in decay, existing, as it were, in
a cultural vacuum, a vaporous
and diffuse atmosphere much hike
that of Baudelaire’s Unreal City.

In fact, the whole poem ie a
series of cleverly concealed ex-
cerpts from great works of litera-
ture which are placed in mew
context to intensify and univers-
alize Eliot’s message.

Dramatized Version Faile

It is in this respect, essentially,
where the reading failed. The
readers did not seem to realise
whom they were quoting and
iconsequently misplaced emphasis
jand inflection. For example, one
jwould think that the passages
from Ecclesiastes would be read
in ringing, awesome tones, where-
as they were actually spokem in
dull monotones.

Mr. Newton’s vague and nebu-
lous musical interjections did,
however, lend an auditory accom-
paniment to the poetical images
| presented, and, for the most part,
i gave the readers a clue to preper
| modulation.

Mistletoe and Santa:

What's Their Origin!

Where is no mystery about the
medérn Christmas tree topped
with its bright star... ablaze
with lights ... and heaped un-
derneath with colored packages—
put in olden times it was shroud-
ed in myth.

For this holiday decoration we
are indebted to the old Northern
European belief that the trees of
te forest were inhabited by god-
tike spirits. The Germans brought
fhe trees into their homes to ap-
pease these “spirits” and show
them they were welcome at the
Wimter Solstice ceremonies.

There is also no doubt about the |
meaning of the modern mistletoe, |
amd what happen to you if you’re
stemding under it. But the cus- |
tom of kissing under the mistletoe
comes down to us from the mystic
rites of the primitive British
priests. In their faraway age, the
mistletoe, which means “all heal,”
was believed to have magic quali-
ties—the power to heal disease,
neutralize poisons, protect its pos- |
sessor from witchcraft, and be-
stow fertility on humans and ani-
mals. If a young couple sealed
their betrothal with a kiss under
the mistletoe, they would receive
wenderful blessings and much
good luck for the rest of their
tives.

is toasted, especially the spiced
drinks served as a feature of
medieval Christmas celebrations

That Yule Log blazing on the
heerth looks simple and provides |
2 wealth of warmth, but the an-
cients were more concerned with |
its mystical associations than its
practicality. The custom was first
practiced by pagans in Scandina-
via, where a huge log was set on
fire in honor of Thor, to mark his |
festival at the time of the winter
solstice. In many parts of Europe
the dragging home of the Yule
Leg is still one of the big events
af the year and a source of great
excitement, especially to the chil-
dren.

We moderns envision Santa
Clause as a paunchy gent, but in
siden times he was a complex
symbol and many things to many
peeple. Santa descends from the
original Saint Nicholas, a kindly
man who lived in Patara, Turkey,
and died a martyr in 342 A. D.,
becoming the patron saint of chil-|
dren.

Whe cult of St. Nicholas spread
aeress Europe. He became the
patron saint of Greece, Holland,
and Belgium. Merchant sailors
sed his three golden*purses as a
device on their guild flags. The
Russians passed the good saint to
fae Scandinavians, at which time
he was still mounted on a white
horse according to an old tradition
of Turkey. x the Scandinav-
iams knew nothing of horses, so
they gave him a reindeer-drawn
sleigh. They also grafted to him
the legend of the Norse God,
Thor, who used to ride through
the sky in a chariot, and would
appear in a red coat for the pagan
feast of Yule.

In the New World, the Dutch
called Saint Nicholas “Santa
Claus” for short. Our modern
conception of him comes from the
femous poem, The Night Before
Christmas. Dr. Clement C. Moore,
a Presbyterian divinity professor
in New York State, wrote it to
pleese his children, and modelled
the hero after a little old wizened
Dutch gentleman he bumped into
one night in 1822—a man with red
cheeks and white hair, smoking
an old clay pipe. Dr. Moore read

the pocm to his delighted chil- |

dren, then threw it in the waste-
basket. A lady visitor fished it
out and printed it a year later in
the Troy, New York Sentinel. It

“FIND THE ANSWER, JIM—AND BRING IT BACK” .

When Jim Boardman took his B.S. in Elec-
trical Engineering at Colorado State, there was
one idea uppermost in his mind. He wanted a
job in which he could work his way into man-
agement via the engineering route. As he puts
it, “I didn’t want to stick with straight engi-
neering all my life.”

After talking to eight other organizations
Jim joined The Mountain States Telephone &
Telegraph Company. He soon got the kind of
action he was looking for.

Six months later, Jim turned in his recom-
mendations. His plan was accepted.

Next stop: Colorado Springs. Here Jim
worked out a plan to expand telephone facilities
for this burgeoning community. This plan, too,
is now in operation.

Today, at 24, Jim has an important role in
planning where, how much, and what kind of
telephone service is needed in the Denver area.

Here’s how Jim puts it: “We get tough assign-
ments—but we also have the freedom to take hold
and doa job. I think the future here is unlimited.
If a man wants to do it—it’s there to be done.”

If yowre a guy who can “Find the answer—
and bring it back” —you’ll want to get with a com-
pany where you have the chance. Visit your Place-
ment Office for literature and additional information.

His first assignment: How best to improve
widely scattered rural telephone service all over
Colorado-a sticky engineering challenge. He
was given a free hand to work out his own pro-
cedures. His boss simply said, ‘Find the answer,
Jim—and bring it back.” ‘

was an immediate success and
flourishes to this day.

Although the Christmas Eve fire which destroyed the central roof,

for returning Bucknellians, things seemed to be returning to normal
by the end of this week.

Drafts or cold spots in the unheated section of the building,

We Get No Letters

One of the fundamental rights of American citizens is
freedom of speech. It is one which we have fought to
preserve in a Revolution and two world wars. As editors
of a college newspaper, we cannot help but wonder why
those involved in a university do not take it upon them-
selves to utilize this privilege. We run a weekly column
entitled Letters to the Editor, which would be a vital ex-
change of opinions, were students of a mind to take pen
in hand to express their views. :

During the semester, we have printed a number of con-
troversial editorials: Homecoming Traditions, the Function
of SFC, the Idea of a University, Counseling and Depend-
ency, to name just a few of these subjects. We haye re-
ceived no written response to any of these challenges.
During Religion in Life week, a number of intriguing dis-
cussions arise and opinions were expressed; the sole fruit
of all was one letter defending the fraternity system,
which no one bothered to answer.

In past years,.a great deal of steam has been generated
over columns which might be called “ ntroversial,” pro-
viding the term was used loosely. One such topic was
that of the calibre of Bucknell women; it seems that the
female ego could not take such a beating and that the
bruised belles were finally called upon to defend them-
selves.

Unfortunately, students do not react accordingly when
their favorite educational theories are attacked. Or could
it be that Bucknell students do not have any intellectual
viewpoints? We prefer to think that perhaps the news-
paper has failed to challenge those views that are held.
But if such is the case, why don’t students take it upon
themselves to advance these ideas in letters, to hold them
up for discussion and publication upon an ideal verbal
battle-ground? .

In snooping around the campus, even Sam has heard
discussions resulting from editorials. But somehow the
sound ideas expressed in these arguments never appear in
written form. Are students afraid to screw their courage
to the sticking place in order to argue an issue? Or are
we lazysperhaps it is too much trouble to jot down one’s
thoughts and drop them into the Bucknellian box!
Neither of these excuses is particularly valid for one who
calls himself a student.

And what of the administration and the faculty? In the
last three years, three letters, all written by members of
the administration, have appeared in this newspaper. We
like to consider ourselves a community of_scholars, but
those who complain that students do not “think” do not
encourage them to do so outside of the classroom or an
occasional conference. What more exciting discussion
might ensue than one between students, administration,
and faculty members on the printed page?

In examining the student newspaper of a European uni-
versity, one cannot help but be ashamed that we have no
such spirited and outspoken comments on subjects such as
academic freedom or the goals of a university.

Lethargy is an infectious state. It reaches the critical
stage when no one takes the time to express his view-
point. We can only hope that this university, in its striv-
ing for academic excellence, can escape the pitfalls of a
regrettable existence.

A Salute to Guy

With the advent of 1961 will come some changes on the
hill. That hallowed hall, where no woman dared to tread,
will lose its awesome reputation. The familiar ring of
the pinball machines will be a ‘sound of the past, and the
orange and blue motel sign is coming down. Guy Payne,
09. is retiring. é

His career has been a colorful one. The citizens of
Lewisburg will not soon forget the bitter invectives of his
pamphlets against such events as the arrival of Dunkle’s
and the birth of Sunday movies. Presidential election
years have always brought full-page outbursts against the
Democrats from-Guy’s vituperative pen.

It hasn’t heen long since Guy stopped riding his pranc-
ing black horse in the annual Homecoming parade. Nor
can we forget the fact that the revenue from his contro-
versial pinball machines has provided funds to send stu-
dents to Various conferences of the Christian Association.

Although Guy Payne’s establishment on the hill has
come in for its share of maligning criticism, we can’t help
feeling that something will be lost when the university
takes it over. As 1961 dawns, we find tradition on the
wane and efficiency replacing it as the means of ‘academic

excellence.

We recognize that this change is necessary for the func-
tional, smooth-tongued age in which today’s college stu-
dents find themselves., But it is with regret that we bid
farewell to the traditions which have endowed this uni-
versity with a spirit of its own. We view the departure
of Guy Payne from active service on the hill as a symbol
of a passing era. With him go the last vestiges of the old
Bucknell. Although we leave behind the color and en-
thusiasm of the past, we greet the rise of a new era with
anticipation.

On Other Campuses

“There's nothing wrong in a self-made man having a good opin-

_ion of himself,” says the Pitt News—“if he can prove it.”

British, Austrians
Offer New Courses

Four British and two Austrian
summer schools are offering spe-
cial six-week courses to Ameri-
can undergraduate and graduaté
students in July and August, it
was announced by the Institute of
Internaticnal Education.

Under the British University
Summer Schools program stu-
dents can apply for study at one
of four schools, each concentrat-
ing on a particular subject and
period. At Stratford-upon-Avon
the subject will be Elizabethan
drama; at the University of Lon-
don the course will be the study
of English literature, art and mu-
sie of the 17th and 18th centuries,
using materials preserved in Lon-
don’s buildings, galleries and rec-
ords; at Oxford the subject will
be English history, literature and
the arts from 1870 to the present.
‘The theme of the Edinburgh
School will be the political and
economic history, philosphy and
|literature of Britain from 1559 to
\1789. Although the courses are
designed for graduate students,
undergraduates in their last two
|years at a university will be con-
\ sidered.

The inclusive charge for board, |
residence and tuition for six-
| weeks at each of the four British
summer schools is L90 (approxi-
|mately $254). A limited number
of full and half scholarships are
available to undergraduates and |
graduates in this program. H
| Salzburg Program

Both Austrian summer schools
include in their programs the op-
|portunity to attend performances
at Salzburg’s famed music festi-
‘val. The Salzburg Summer School
stresses the German language
jand requires that all students en-
‘rell in a language course. Other
|courses—foreign policy, Austrian
\literature, European music and}
history of Austrian art—will be
taught in English. The fee for the

AS MEMORIES FOND COME TROOPING BY

Lewisburg 1855

Snows have been making the trip to the college at Lewisburg
increasingly difficult. T. V. Purdy of the class of 1859 makes the fol-
lowing report: :

“On the fifth of October 1855 the writer started in company of

| Prof. H. D. Walker to make the journey from Scranton to Lewisburg.

We left Scranton, (then a small village), ina stage coach, at four
o'clock in the afternoon and arrived at Wilkes-Barre at nine o’clock
in the evening. Taking beds, we slept until one o’clock, and then
took the packet boat for Northumberland. We passed the Nanticoke
dam about daylight and reached Northumberland at sunset. Here
we were compelled to remain over night, and the next morning we
took the stage, run by John Hess, and came up on the eastern side of
the river, crossing on the old wagon bridge at the foot of Market
Street, and reaching our destination about ten o’clock in the forenoon.
We had thus been on the road forty-three hours”.

The Rev. John M. Lynons gives a similar account:

“The first time I.came to Bucknell, or Lewisburg, was by stage
coach. Well do I remember the coach stopping at a house near Mon-
tandon, at four o’clock in the morning when it was still dark. The
driver in a coarse voice said ‘passenger off for Lewisburg’. I asked
him where Lewisburg was located. He pointed in the direction and
said, ‘Over that way’. Placing my little horse hair trunk on my
shoulder, I trudged the distance on foot to Lewisburg, for there was
no other way to get there”.

It would certainly seem that a college composed of as young and
staunch as these can not fail to be a success. Most certainly this de-
votion to academic endeavors shall permeate future generations of
Bucknellians. 5

Basketball Team Crushes Colgate 104-82 [Dumars, State

The Bucknell basketball team
crushed Colgate Wednesday night
104-82.

To say that the Bisons
had a hot night from the floor

would be the master of under-
statement.

Led by Co-Captains
Dick Kniffin and Joe Steiner the W TH N
Bisons blasted the Colgate de-

fense for 47 field goals, a court
record. Kniffin played a magnifi-
cent all-around game, hitting on
13 of 22 shots from the floor, and
five out of five from the free
throw line, to tally 31 points, the
highest total for a Bucknell play-
er since 1956, when Mike Corri-
gan poured in 33.

Joe Steiner collected 22 points,
18 in the first half. The 6-5 na-
tive of Punxatawney flipped nine
of 11 shots in the first period, but
extended himself to the point
where he could hit on but two of
nine tries from the field in the
second stanza. Joe cleared the
poard 14 times before he left the
game midway through the second
half. Hal Smoker and Don Lam-
pus picked up the slack and
swept the boards 20 times be-
tween them.

Steiner Hits 9 for 11

Joe Steiner opened the scoring
with a jumper, but Colgate coun-
tered immediately to knot the
score at 2-2. That was the last
time the Red Raiders were in con-
tention. Another jumper by Joe,
a foul shot by the visitors and the
Bisons reeled off ten straight
points to make it 14-3. 21-16 was
the closest Colgate came to equal-
ling a hot shooting Bucknell |
squad. Midway through the half,
Coach Ben Kribbs sent in Mike
Kasnick and Don Lampus, and.
both hit well enough to keep the:
Bison offense rolling. Between |
them they connected on nine of}
ten shots in the game. |

Colgate used a post-splitting of- |
fense to good effect as the half
wore on and Bucknell was able,
to increase their lead to only 137
points despite a 56 persent shoot-
ing average from the floor. The.
score at halftime read 47-36 in
favor of the Bisons.

The 57 point explosion in the!
second half hiked the score to the
second highest in Davis Gym his- |
tory. In 1955 a Bucknell team
scored 111 points against F. & M.
Eleven Bisons got into the scor-
ing act as Tom Johnson’s foul
shot sent the score over the cen-
tury mark. Bucknell hit on 47 of
85 tries from the field. Colgate
had been a six point favorite in
the contest. Their star guard,
Jim Duffy, bagged 26 points to!
lead the Red Raiders. The Bisons ,
are now averaging 74.6 points per
contest including a 92.5 average |
in their last three games. i

Delaware
Preview

by Mike Feigenbaum

The Bucknell courtmen will be
out to extend their longest win-
ning streak in two years Satur-
day, when they take on the Blue
Hens of Delaware for the second
time this year. In the first en-
counter, played just before the
Christmas recess, the Bisons man-
aged to hold off an inspired Dela-
ware team, and win, 81-80.

After knocking off Delaware on
Friday night, the 16th, the Bisons
came back on Monday to score
their most impressive victory of
the season, a 93-76 licking of
Baldwin-Wallace. Co-captains Joe
Steiner and Dick Kniffin hit for
their highest point totals so far,
30 and 27 points respectively.
With Kniffen staying in the ball
games for more than a half, and
the return of 6-3 Mike *Fadden,
the Bisons look much stronger for
the second part of the season.

Delaware has always been

| tough for Bucknell, especially on

their home court, where two years
ago, they beat a great Bucknell
team led by “Moose” Danzig. The
present representatives have the
potential to put on as good an ex-
hibition of basketball as any pre-
vious Bison team. With the scor-
ing of Steiner and Kniffin, and
the greatly improved play of
Bruce Babich, the Bisons should
hold their own with any team
they face in the remainder of the
year.

Steiner has been averaging al-
most 22 points a game, and if he
continues at this pace, he should
break all Bucknell scoring rec-
ords. Big Hal Smoker should
take some of the load off of him
on the inside, thus freeing Joe to
put on quite a scoring show.

With a victory over Delaware,
the Bisons could be well on their
way to another fine season, and
to keeping the 1960-61 sports sea-
son as one of the best in school
history.

‘Summer Institute
Receives Two Grants

Less Hours, More Study| LETTERSTO |

With the outside pressure of more students demanding THE EDITOR
admission than most universities can handle, many edu- |»

cational institutions are turning to the trimester or the
quarter system. With the aim of educating as many as
possible in the shortest time, such a system requires fac-
ulty members who are willing to teach all year round and
maintenance of university housing and, dining facilities
for twelve months of the year.

Such a change, while feasible for large universities or
metropolitan areas, is simply impractical for a small pri-
vately-endowed institution which wants to stay that way.
By ruling out such a plan, we cancel one of the outlets to
the problem of quantity overruling quality of student
work.

Before Christmas, the Bucknellian printed an editorial
discussing the student who “staggers under a load of work
demanded in greater quantity by each of his professors.”
At that time we suggested two solutions to the dilemna:
“the reduction of the number of courses taken in a semes-
ter from five to four;” and the institution of a trimester or
quarter system “which allows students to enroll in fewer
courses and to do concentrated research in each.”

Let us investigate the first solution as a means to the end
desired by both suggestions: adequate time for students to
agcomplish the mature and creative work of which they
are capable. Under the present set-up, it is too much,
even for the best students, to enroll in five thought-pro-
voking courses given by five challenging professors. As
a result, one either signs up for three “brainteasers,” pad-
ding his schedule with two Q. C. courses, or one elects a
majority of “easier” professors in order to accomplish the
required work without cracking under mental and physi-
cal strain.

Although both professors and courses have improved in
quality, students are forced to profane their academic op-
portunities to the god of time, who devours health, intel-
lect, and achievement indiscriminately. A reduction in
the minimum number of hours for a semester would free
the student for adequate preparation and research in each
course.

Such a change requires a climate in which neither fac-
ulty nor students will relax standards of academic en-
deavor. A decrease in courses, however, may also help
to create the climate necessary for scholastic excellence.
We seem to be approaching this climate at the present
time, for students, finally able and willing to meet the
challenges imposed by professors, complain of too little
time to do work of sufficient depth.

In permitting Bucknellians to take fewer courses, the
success of the venture rests with the students. Are we
disciplined enough to use our additional time for study or
will we merely indulge in more extra-curricular activi-
ties and extended social occasions? As students, we be-
lieve that we have reached a point of discipline and aca-
demic iftterest which rnerits a reduction in the required

Dear Editor:

Having read the article in this
Friday’s Bucknellian entitled,
“We Get No Letters,” I am in-
ispired to make known my feel-
lings on this matter. Not only are
students not writing letters to the
editor concerning academic and
local campus interests, but no one
seems to be thinking of the fu-
ture in terms of our government
and our democracy.

|

| This may sound overly patriotic
lor exaggerated, but after reading
up on the present situation and
| what is going on outside our cozy
little 300 acres at Bucknell, I real-
\ize that this is no longer a vague |
jnightmare that could never be
true, but a real situation that is
actually in existence.

| Russians have been training
| 800,000 students a year for the
jlast ten. years in concentrated
| courses on spreading propaganda; |
| propaganda, not in the sense of
lies about the United States, but
lof the idealistic principles of
| Communism in its realized, fulfill-}
jed form. This is not the present
jform in Russia today, of course, |
| but what they are striving for.

| The Russians do not want war}

| anymore than the United States |
idoes, but their goal is to have the |
jentire world be Communistic, and
ithey are determined to reach this |
| goal, eventually. The gains they |
,have made in the small countries |
in the recent years are over-
'powering when compared to the |
| small amount that has been done

| by us. |

Here is the proof of our over- |
confidence in our position in the |
world today. We sit in all our}
comfort and say, “It can’t happen,
we are too strong.” How fast)
lean the education system in the
United States produce equivalent |
‘men and women to those who,
have a ten year start on us?

One of the most important |
threats to us and our lives has}
been occurring gradually over the |

Unique Opportunity for College Studies = «4 Challenge to

available to American graduate
and undergraduate students for
the fall semester at the newly
launched East-West Center of the
University of Hawaii. The grants,
most of them for as long as two
years ($3710-$4310 a year) in
Asian Studies and related fields,
include an expense-paid study
tour of the Asian area or country
pertinent to the individual’s spe-
cialization. Application must be
made by March 1 for scholarships
effective in Sept.

Under the East-West Center
scholarships, juniors and seniors
have the opportunity to major in
Asian and Pacific Studies, while
graduate students pursue Asian
Studies either in an inter-depart-
mental program or in individual
fields, or in the Overseas Opera-
tions Program designed for Amer-
icans who plan to work in the
Asian and Pacific areas.

The East-West Center, made
possible by an initial grant from
the State éf Hawaii and a federal
grant of $10,000,000, was conceiv-
ed as a nucleus of free inter-
change of knowledge and culture
among potential leaders of Asia,
the United States, and the Pacific.

Located a short distance from
the center of cosmopolitan Hono-
yulu and Waikiki, the Center will
house 2,000 Asians and Americans

Grants totaling $105,300 were
awarded by the National Science
Foundation for the continuation
of two summer institute programs
at Bucknell.

The largest grant, $66,300, will
be used to conduct the Summer
Institute in Science and Mathe-
matics, while the second grant,
amounting to $39,000, has been
earmarked for the Summer Insti-
tute in Engineering Sciences.

Both grants are designed to
strengthen the training of
scientists by providing six-week
courses which will enable high

sciences to keep abreast of the
latest developments in their re-
spective fields. The grants pro-
vide stipends covering tuition,
fees and a cash allowance for de-
pendents.

Playing aj

tbounds. This was a very import-'

ant win for the Bisons, as the
foare oes rivalry is one of the KNIFFIN,

most important to both teams.

In the preliminary game, the NAMED ALL-EAST

pressing 3-2 zone, the Thundering | frosh, sparked by Bill Fry’s 30

straight game.

In the first half the lead chang- |
ed hands 11 times with State)
holding the largest margin of six!
points at the 12 minute mark. !
The Bisons were continually frus- |
trated in the first half by tbe fine |
inside play of Gene Harris. The
6-3 forward scored constantly on
rebounds and “dummy passes”
from DuMars. However, thanks
to the clutch shooting of co-cap-
tain Joe Steiner, BU rallied, and
the team left the floor at halftime
tied 32-32.

As the second half began, the
Lions quickly opened up a six-
point lead, 42-36 and, with only

x minutes remaining, had then

retched this advantage to 59-50.
At this point co-captain Dick
Kniffin hit on two straight jump-
shots, and sophomore Sam Pen-,;
rose contributed a third, putting |
the Bisons to within three points. |
After Harris dunked in two more}
points, Penrose hit on a long}
jump-shot, and Steiner scored on |
a tremendous three point play, |
tieing the score at 61 all with four
minutes left to play. |

Kniff Stumps DuMars |

Harris scored again for State,}
but Kniffin came up with the
great play of the game, stealing}
the ball from DuMars and scoring |
on a driving lay-up. From this
point on the Bisons seemed to}
come alive. After Jake Trueblood |
hit a jump-shot, BU ripped off|
five straight points and, with only
1:38 left, held a three point lead. |
With only 16 seconds left and the}
score 69-67, Harris had a chance}
to tie up the game with two foul}

JIM HAND ROLLS 300GAME GW to Test

Jim Hand, Bucknell tennis star,|on my side.”

attaimed the seemingly impossible
goal of every player in another
sport, Tuesday, when he rolled
the first perfect game ever bowled
at the Campus Alleys. Twelve
strikes in a row gave the senior

the bowling world, a 300 game.
Hand estimated that at least
nine of his rolls were good hits—
between the one and the three
pins—and that three balls must
have been directed by the fates.

Hand described his feeling dur-

confidence to complete mesmeriz-

next game was right down the
middle, as was his next, and the
one following, and two more after
that. Jim, who had changed his
form slightly three days before,
had never had more than five
strikes in a row.

he told me they used to, back in
1930, but then a fire in Old Main

classes resumed the taboo was es-

girls, and the boys ruled the Inn.
Of course, he added, the faculty

have been.

“IT’S HERE-IF YOU. WANT TO WORK FOR IT”

Even before Ron Spetrino received his engi-
neering degree from Case he had good job offers
from six companies. .

He joined The Ohio Bell Telephone*Company
—his reason: ‘I was convinced an engineer could
go further here—if he was willing to work for it.”

As soon as Ron got his feet on the ground
in telephone engineering, he was tapped for a
tough assignment. The job—to engineer switch-
ing equipment modifications needed to prepare '
Cleveland for nationwide customer dialing of long
distance calls.

Ron wrapped it up in five months, and found
he had earned a shot at another tough assignment.
In this job Ron helped engineer a completely new
long distance switching center for Cleveland. This
switching center connected Cleveland with the
nationwide customer dialing network. It was
about a year later that Ron put the finishing

touches on the specs for this $1,600,000 project.
Today, as a Supervising Engineer, Ron heads
a staff of five engineers and is responsible for

telephone switching in much of the greater
Cleveland area.

He supervises the design and purchase of $3
million worth of equipment a year. And even
more important, he is charged with developing
the technical and managerial skills of his staff.

Ron knows what he’s talking about when he
says, “In this business you have to do more than
a good job. We expect a man to bea self-developer.
We expect him to take responsibility from his
first day on the job and think for himself. You
don’t get ahead around here by just doing time.”

If you want a job in which you're given every
chance to prove yourself, and real responsibility
right from the start—you’ll want to see your Place-
ment Office for further information.

“Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most vital, intelli-
gent, positive and imaginative men we

can, possibly find.”

In spite of its successful stage
history Giroudoux’s Amphitryon
38 has usually been praised in
this country for the wrong rea-
sons. Evén after seeing the very
expert performance of it by the
Lunts in 1937, most New York
critics judged that it differed from
other “bedroom farces” only’ by
being more “sophisticated”—
“Bulfinch with a bedside man-

\ner,” as John Mason Brown put

it. Variety reported that the
play had been “nixed” for per-
formance in London by the Brit-
ish censor.
Platonic Idealism
Yet actually the play is the

most eloquent expression of Pla- |

tonic idealism in modern litera-
ture. Readers of Giraudoux’s

‘novel Suzanne Et Le Pacifique

and of his other plays should
easily recognize in Alkmena one

of the most notable of Girau-}

doux’s “essence characters”—the
essence of fidelity. She is the

have never seen a frostbite.

There are, of course, certain difficulties attending a municipal

to move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents no great prob-

in turn is connected to the Atlantic Ocean. You start dragging
Lake Michigan to Phoenix and, willy-nilly, you'll be dragging
all that other stuff too. This would make our British allies
terribly cross, and I can’t say as I blame them. I mean, put
yourself in their place. What if, for example, you were a British
workingman who had been saving and scrimping all year for a
summer holiday at Brighton Beach, and then when you got to
Brighton Beach there wasn’t any ocean? There you’dbe with your
inner tube and snorkel and nothing to do all day but dance the
Lambeth Walk. This, you may be sure, would not make you
NATO-minded!

I appeal most earnestly to the residents of Chicago and
Phoenix to reconsider. I know it’s no bowl of cherries going
through life without ever seeing an iguana or a frostbite, but I
ask you—Chicagoans, Phoenicians—is it too big a price to pay
for preserving the unity of the free world? I am sure that if
you search your hearts you will make the right decision, for
all of us—whether we live in frostbitten Chicago, iguana-ridden
Phoenix, or narrow-lapelled New Haven—are first and foremost
Americans!

But I digress. We were speaking of 1961, our new year. And
new it is! There is, for one thing, new pleasure,in Marlboro
Cigarettes. How can there be new pleasure in Marlboros avhen
that fine, flavorful blend, that clean easy draw filter, have not
been altered? The answer is simple: each time you light a
Marlboro, it is like the first time. The flavor is such that age
cannot wither nor custom stale. Marlboro never palls, never
jades, never dwindles into dull routine. Each pack, each
cigarette, each puff, makes you glad all over again that you are
a Marlboro smoker!

So, Marlboros in hand, let us march confidently into 1961.
May good fortune attend our ventures! May happiness reign! °
May Chicago and Phoenix soon recover from their disappoint-
ment and join’ our bright cavalcade into a braye tomorrow!

Discrimination?

Bucknell seems far removed from the racial segrega-
tion struggle at the University of Georgia, but is it? We
now have two Negro students at Bucknell, both of them
men. None were admitted in the class of 1964. Twelve
years ago, there were ten Negro students, both men and
women, some of whom had white roommates, attending
this university. By way of comparison, we have moved
backward.

To what may we attribute this regression? Certainly,
admission policies have a great deal to do with the num-
ber of Negro students who enter Bucknell. As students,
we haye never been given a clear statement of discrimin-
ation policy by this university. We are asking, at this
time, that such a statement be made.

And what of the application form? After repeated
badgering and questioning on the part of this newspaper,
students, and certain faculty members, the Admissons
Committee deleted this year the question concerning the

We question the Admission Committee’s decision to re-
tain the picture and would be interested in hearing their
reasons for so deciding. Perhaps their answer will be
part of the statement of discrimination policy for which
we are calling. The Bucknellian will gladly print such a
statement if the university staff-can produce one.

WSGA: What For?

The Women’s Student Government Association has
been operating under a revised constitution and cooper-
ative system for more than a semester. From various
sections of the campus have come conflicting reports:
From the head resident of a freshman house, “It isn’t
working in our house; no one’ reports anything.” From
the head of an upperclass residence council: “We ean’t
decide when to see people and when not to; consequently,
we've never called anyone in.” From a woman student in
Harris: “We get caught up in pretty things like telephone
hours.and quiet hours and miss the significant cases.”
From a council assistant in Larison: “it’s working fine, as
far as I can see; the freshmen understand the government
and are able to make it work.”

What are we to believe from such inconsistent reports?
Is the council assistant program working well in some liv-
ing situations and not in others? Are the time-consuming
smaller cases being weeded out by the residence councils.
leaving Judicial Bard time for more important cases and
discussions of policy? Is the line of communication be-
tween Judicial Board and the Residence Councils clear
and frequently used?

More important, perhaps, is the question of whether
more women are being involved in student government
and are showing a concern for both individual and collec-
tive responsibility. As the mouthpiece of the university
community, we would like to call for an evaluation of the
proposed system. Such an evaluation would demand
comments from Senate, Judicial Board, House of Reps,
and members of the Dean of Women’s staff.

Moreover, we would like to see some tangible results
from the Committee for Constitutional Revisions, which
has been meeting behind closed doors for several months.
Before we begin the election of a new set of WSGA of-
ficers, perhaps women should be questioned as to the
value of student government? Is it worth the time and
energy expended on it? Do enough people possess the
intrinsic belief in self-government to warrant continuing
it?

These questions were raised last year. We raise them
again, and this time, we should like an answer.

; Dear Editor, :
| The opinion expressed in a Let-
iter to the Editor of the Dec. 2nd
issue of The Bucknellian about
anti-intellectudl attitudes arising
from “vocational type” courses is,
to my mind, mistaken. The let-
ter stated that certain vocational
type courses like pre-med, engi-
neering, geology, et alia are basic-
ally non-intellectual, that, they
are not searching for the truth,
{and that they are professional
\training. These so-called non-in-
tellectual courses, particularly
pre-med and engineering, are tra-
ditionally regarded as tough
courses. Witness the number of
students who drop out of these
courses. Obviously they require
superior intellects.

The student asleep, the text book calls.
Out of the bed-covers warm and snug,
The sleeper leaps up with a shrug.
The day dawns, night falls.

Dark shadows are cast on the walls

From the light on the book which calls and calls.
The (three) hour exam, the fourth in a row,

It’s the most formidable foe.

The day dawns, night falls.

Morning dawns in many shower stalls
Students wake, the water falls. »

The four is near, who shall care,

In an hour or two, how did I fare?
The day down, night falls.

Swimmers Set Back
By Kent State, Pitt

The Bucknell swimming team
took it on the chin twice in two
days last weekend as they were
upset by Kent State of Ohio, 49-
46, and Pittsburgh 57-38. In both
meets the relay races told the
story. The Bisons didn’t win one
relay event in their two day trip.
Bucknell continued to dominate
the individual events, especially
the freestyle and backstroke.

THE ENGINEERS HAVE HAIRY EARS

Today in this age of technology when engineering graduates
are wooed and courted by all of America’s great industries, how
do you account for the fact that Rimbaud Sigafoos, who fin
ished at the very top of his ‘class at M.I.T., turned down hun-
dreds of attractive job offers to accept employment as a machin-

ery wiper at the Acme Ice Company at a salary of $20 .a week
with a twelve-hour day, a seven-day week, and only fifteen

minutes for lunch?

I know what you are thinking: “Cherchez la femme!” You are

thinking that Mr. Acme, head of the Acme Ice Company, has
a beautiful daughter with whom Rimbaud is madly in love and
he took the job only to be near her.

Friends, you are wrong. It is true that Mr. Acme does have
a daughter, a large, torpid lass named Clavdia who spends all *
her waking hours scooping marzipan out of a bucket and staring
at a television set which has not worked in some years. Rimbaud
has not the slightest interest in Clavdia; nor, indeed, does any
other man, excepting possibly John Ringling North.

So how come Rimbaud keeps working for the Acme Ice
Company? Can it be that they provide him with free Marlboro

No, friends, to, Rimbaud is not allowed to smoke on the job
and when he finishes his long, miserable day he has to buy his
own Marlboros, even as you and I, in order to’settle back and
enjoy that choice tobacco, that smooth, mellow flavor, that in-
comparable filter, that pack or box.

Well, friends, you might aswell give up because you'll never
in a million years guess why Rimbaud works for the Aeme Ice
Company. The reason is simply this: Rimbaud is a seal!

He started as a performing seal in vaudeville. One night on
the way to the Ed Sullivan show, he took the wrong subway.
All night the poor mammal rode the B.M.T., seeking a helping
hand. Finally a kindly brakeman named Ernest Thompson
Sigafoos rescued the hapless Rimbaud. :

Medical Student Describes Year in Indonesia,

Reviews Experience with ‘The Burma Surgeon’

Editor's Note: We take pleasure in printing this letter
from Charlie Cargille ‘56, who is now a senior at Johns Hop-
kins Medical School. He receritly returned from Indonesia ‘
where he attended a medical school for one year in order to
find out about medical procedures in other countries.

by Charles M. Cargille ‘56

You are probably wondering about my trip home from South
East Asia, and I wish to share a few of the highlights enroute from
Indonesia to New York. It was a wonderful experience, and though
time was short, I saw many places, visiting in mission ‘hospitals and
making friends along the way. After leaving Djakarta, I returned
to the Medical School in Singapore and spent four days with student
friends, having the opportunity to»rest and post home several pack-
ages of gifts from Indonesia.

* Leaving Singapore by train I traveled to Bangkok in Thailand
and visited the large Adventist Hospital as guest of the staff. Dur-
ing my brief stay, I made rounds and observed in the outpatient
clinic. Bangkok was a most enjoyable city, and the Christian nurses
showed me great kindness. ea

Burma was the delight of my return trip. After spending several
days in Rangoon visiting a good friend who formerly had been to my
home while studying in America, I went to Muse and Namkham on
the Chinese border. My friend Dr. Al Lun met the bus at Muse,
which is a very small village only 19 miles from Namkham, where
Dr. Seagrave, the “Burma Surgeon,” works. Dr. Ai Lun showed
slides from his visit to America, and there was much to discuss. His
son drove me to Namkham by jeep, and it’was a thrill to meet Dr.
Seagrave for the first time.

He was playing baseball with the nurses when I arrived. He
appeared an old man, head bent low, with white hair, and walking
with effort. We played side by side for the rest of the game as he
described the hospital and school of nursing, the great medical needs

slavia, when a most unfortunate thing occurred. I had been travel-|
|ing with two friends, a Swede and a Pakistani. Our train was be-
| hind schedule, and it was necessary for us to switch cars to continue
| on towards Munich, Germany. Suddenly, in the midst of great con-
fusion, everything went wrong. The most frustrating moment of my
life was there in the station as I stood watching my train and my
friends go off to Munich, and one moment later saw my luggage leave
for Vienna, while I got left in Yugoslavia.

Two days later on the ferry to Denmark, I found the Swede, who
had felt very badly about this, and received from him my sole pos-
session which has survived—a bottle of banana liquor from Turkey,
which the Pakistani had been carrying for me in his suitcase. Even
now it stands onthe shelf with my books. Thus it was that I arrived
in Sweden hungry, dirty, cold, fatigued, unshaven and sleepy—dress-

The student sailing from Rotterdam to New York was good fun.
We had over 800 students on board.” Several of us spent the days
playing chess, interrupted only by a series of lectures and discussions
on world politics, the iron curtain and communism. These were led
by two excellent speakers, Joseph Josten, an exiled Czech foreign
ministry officer who nowruns a news agency in London covering the
| iron. curtain countries, (author of Oh, My Country, the story of the
!communist coup in Czechoslovakia) and Hiram McLendon, former
| Harvard history professor now authoring a two-volume work on
| counter-revolution and contemporary philosophy. These sessions
| were a great stimulation and drew on the experiences of many stu-
| dents aboard who had lived in or traveled through these lands. ‘

Skiing was hard, fast and fun on
that last day. The new skiers of
the group after a week of lessons
had progressed to the T-Bar slope
and were doing professional snow

skiers, after a few days of icy

was a tremendous drain upon his body and spirit.

Dr. Seagrave taught for four hours each morning. I would ad-!
mit, examine, and prescribe for the morning outpatients and new)
admissions, usually eight in number. When the Indian physician
there started surgery, I joined him to assist on the major cases or
handle the minor myself. It was a valuable experience in mincr
surgery to open abscesses, debride carbuncles, remove bullets, and
assist with superficial lipomas and tonsillectomys. I removed one
tonsil myself and assisted withthe removal of a huge ovarian cvst
on a patient whom I had admitted and diagnosed. :

Though Namkham is at an altitude of 3000 feet and has a very

Seagrave was forced to live on a strict schedule to conserve his en-

Dr. Seagrave is unable to walk for ward rounds, the tiny Burmes

soon said he trusted my ears as well as his own and discontinued
checking my findings unless I requested his opinion.

At first we discussed the various interesting points of diagnosis
and therapy so much that it slowed his work. He is a natural teacher
and can hardly keep himself from sharing knowledge or swapping
stories, and I saw many new things to question him about. But soon

efficiently as a team. This was a wonderful thing for me. |
In a very few days I grew in efficiency and speed as well as con-,

and to perform minor surgery. I saw conditions for the first time—
scurvy, typhoid, cerebral malaria, hookworm, and ascariasis. Dr.;

From Calcutta I continued on by train day and night, stopping |
only in Delhi a few hours for a visa enroute to Amritsar. .There for|
the second time I visited the beautiful Golden Temple of the Sikh!

To Feature Festival Quartet

The Festival Quartet

Four celebrated musicians will
be heard on Tuesday, Feb. 14,
when the Artist Seri presents
the Festival Quartet

Scheduled for p. m. in the
Davis Gymnasium, the concert

jll feature. pianist Victor Babin,

ist Szymon Goldber, violist
William Primrose and cellist Nik-

olai Graudan in’ a program of»

chamber music.

Ever since its formation four |
years ago, the Festival Quartet)

has dedicated itself to performing
the rich piano quartet literature
of such composers as Beethoven,
Brahms, Mendelssohn, Mozart,
Schumann and Strauss. It con-
stitutes the first contemporary
quartet in more than three dec-
ades to be made up of world-re-
nowned artists for the purpose of
presenting the finest in chamber
music to the concert audience.
Although most of the great
composers wrote numerous pieces

for the piano quartet, and many |

contemporary composers favor it,
the concert audience seldom has

an opportunity to attend chamber

music programs because artists

rarely commit themselves to the

time and effort necessary to mas-

ter it. Until the establishment of

the Festival Quartet, chamber

programs by outstanding

ns were usually restricted

such as the

held in

large metropolitan centers like
New York.

Victor Babin, in addition to be-
ing the male half of the premier
|two-piano team of Vronsky and
| Babin, is a composer with a long
list of published works to his
credit; Szymon Goldberg, a mas-
ter violinist, is especially known
for his concerts with chamber or-
chestra in which he acts both as
conductor and soloist; William
Primrose is considered the most
famous violist of our time; while
Nikolai Graudan, the Quartet’s
cellist, has toured the world over
as a recitalist. General admission
will be $2.50.

The Festival Quartet will play

hallenge: Peace Corps

President Kennedy has recently proposed a program
known as The Peace Corps. This program involves the
sending of volunteers, preferably recent college graduates,
to underdeveloped countries. These people would com-
pose The Peace Corps. The function of this corps would
be to teach and aid in political adjustment of newly inde-
pendent countries,

Originally the plan was to exempt the members of the
corps from the draft, but that provision has been dropped.
It is a far from glamorous proposition.. It would involve
living in a backward country and being paid a minimum
salary. It now no langer holds the attraction of draft |
exemption for young men. |

The program has been conceived as a contrast to the |
American habit of aiding foreign countries with money, |
and offering them no practical assistance in the running |
of an unstable country. The Kennedy administration has |
been characterized by the word vigorous. This word sums |
up the type of people who will be needed to make The,
Peace Corps a reality. Service in it offers no material
rewards, and certainly no special recognition. However,
it does offer the chance to do something for America.

Since most young men are subject to the draft, it will
be up to the young women of the country. to answer Presi-
dent Kennedy’s challenge to get out in the world and
work for America and her principles. It has been said
that America’s colleg@ students are the “softest” ever.
This is a chance to show that we have just as much spirit
and desire, if not more, than our fathers and grandfathers.
There are a.good many seniors who have yet to plot their
futures. We suggest that they give The Peace Corps seri-
ous consideration.

Your editorial of Feb. 3 was
written out of ignorance and so
does not really deserve a reply.

tired of the phony liberals and

am reminded of the pseudo-schol-

prejudice to be sullied by fact.

It is quite true that there are
fewer negro students at Bucknell
this year than there have been at
some times in the past. No one
at Bucknell is rejoicing about this.
But it is hardly typical of the ed-
ucated mind to conclude that this

Marsha O’Bannon
Chairman, CHALLENGE

Dear Editor,

I am perplexed by two ques-
tions concerning the Reserve Of-
ficer’s Training Corps at Bucknell.
First, will sophomore men of the
class of 1964 be required to take
ROTC? The ROTC department
has failed to state clearly its
policy regarding this question.
Could it be that the ROTC depart-
ment fears that answering this
question in the open might result
in a co-ordinated student protest
against the fairness of such a pro-
gram at Bucknell? I should hope
not.

But why, then, have the only
statements issued from the ROTC
department concerning such a
program taken the form of sug-
gested rumors and hints spread
by class instructors? The only
official indication of how the ad-
ministration stands on this ques-
tion appears on page 94 of the
new 1960-1961. Bucknell catalogue:
In the fourth footnote on that
page we are told that Military
Science 21-22 will be “Optional
for men entering as freshmen in
1961 or-later.” But why has the
administration, like the ROTC de-
partment, handled this question
in such a hushed-up manner?
Surely if the administration
wanted to make freshmen clearly
aware of their ROTC obligation,
it could have done so more suc-
cessfully than by surreptitiously
referring to this requirement in
aseemingly unimportant footnote.

I would also like to know why
the ROTC department has recent-
ly decided to institute two new
ranks that have never before been
held by ROTC cadets at Bucknell.
one-half of the
freshman cadets will be made
Privates First Class, while one-
fourth will become Corporals. I
contend that there is no need for
this change. Perhaps this is noth-

jing more than an attempt by the
'ROTC department to create false

enthusiasm for the ROTC
gram in the minds of cadets.
Isn't it fortunate that the ROTC
department will manage to make
those promotions just before Feb-
ruary 17? Gee, I hope I’m one
of those lucky cadets who gets to

pro-

|wear his stripes to the Military

Ball!
Sincerely,
Myron Greenberg

You raise some valid questions,
Mr. Greenburg,’ which perhaps
the ROTC department will under-
take to answer. Just where do

from The Bucknellian inquire of
the Admissions Office, of the
‘Dean, of the President, or of any
other responsible spokesman for

Did you inquire how many
negroes applied for admission in
the class of 19642 How many

| Dear Editor,

Any student of the applied na-
tural science must welcome Mr.
Riley’s attempted defense of his
intellect. An engineering student,
a pre-med student, or a geology
student is not a technician and is
not, we hope, unmindful of the
truths of our world, whatever
these truths may be.

Mr. Riley's argument support-
ing the intellectuality of the
science student suffers when we
observe that few of these students
use or try to use the scientific pro-
cess to establish a general’ law of
the physical- world. Rather than
searching for and establishing
such laws or truths, they work
from laws and truths already es-
tablished.

When applied to particles hav-
ing ordinary velocities, Newton's
laws of motion are not challeng-
ed. Indeed, the student is not
asked to challenge such laws, nor
is he asked to search for laws to
take their place. His job is to
assimilate and apply such laws.
As Mr. Riley points out, the mor-

ality rate among science students
‘llustrates the difficulty of this
task. This mortality rate, how-
over, is not a measure of the in
ellectuality of the curriculum,
vhere intellectuality, as Mr. Riley
yas said, is a search for “the
ruth.” It would seem that this
efinition admits only students of
cientific research to the ranks) of

$25 Prize Offered to Winner
Of One-Act Play Competition Here Sunday

by Grenville Cuyler

Dr. Willard Smith, chairman of
the English department, has again
announced that the English de-
partment is offering a prize of $25
for a student-written, one-act play
suitable for production by the
Aetors’ Lab of Cap & Dagger.
The manuscripts submitted will
be judged by Grenville Cuyler,
director of the Actors’ Lab, and

a committee composed of mem-|

bers of Cap & Dagger. All manu-
seripts must be submitted to the
office of the English department
by Fri., March 24, at noon.

In the past an award has been
given at the end of the year for
the best full-length play written
by a student. It is the feelings
of the English department that
the one-act play is more within
the beginning playwright’s scope
and is less demanding on his time.
If a strong response is made to
this contest, it is conceivably pos-
sible that the larger award could
be operative again.

Past Productions

Significant also are the contrib:
utions that the University Theatre
has made in the past in develop-
ing original play
tions. Cap & Dagger’s first musi-
cal production was Star Bright by
George Egan and Eugene Nico-
lant, of the class of 1942, produced

in 1942, and again in 1946 for the,

Bucknell Centennial Celebration.

In 1952, the students ef Buck-
nell translated Leocadia by Jean
Anouilh. The preparation for its
preduction included trans-Atlan-
tie phone calls by Mr. Anouilh’s
Americ:
producer. Cap & Dagger gave!
standing room performances of;
this play for its English premiere. ,
They showed much foresight, for |
it wasn’t until six years later that
this same play, under the name
of Time Remembered, was pro-
duced on Broadway with Helen
Hayes in the leading role.

ROTC Department
Drops and Adds

In recent weeks, the Military |
Science department has lost one}
member and gained four new
members. SFC William Walters,
coach of the Rifle Team, left}
Bucknell at the end of December |
and reported to Fort Benning,
Georgia, where he will attend a
course in Army Communications.
He then expects to serve overseas. |

Replacing SFC Walters will be,
M/SGT Franklin E. Ritter who}
hails from Cincinnati, O. M/SGT
Ritter entered the Army in 1947
and took his basic training at
Fort Knox, Ky. During his last
assignment he was a member of}
the Marksmanship Committee at
the Aberdeen Proving Grounds,
Aberdeen, Md.

SFC Dean E. Evans comes to
Bucknell as an Assistant Instruc-
tor for MS-I. Originally from
Strangsport, Pa., he attended the
Coalport-Irvona High School. Af-
ter entering the Army in 1942 he
took his basic training at Fort|
Belvoir; Va. His last assignment
was with the 2nd Armored Bat-
tallian of the 41st Infantry in Ger-
many. -

SP/5 William L. Grogan hails |
from Harrisburg, Pa. After grad-
uating from Woodrow Wilson Vo- |
cational ‘High School in Jamaica, |
New York, he entered the Army |
in 1944 and completed his basic
training at Fort Sill, Okla. Prior
te coming to Bucknell SP/5 Gro-
gan was stationed on Formosa}
and at Fort Knox. He will serve!
in the administration office for}
the, department.

SP/5 Leroy J. Wagner is the)
newest member of the Military
Science staff. Originally from
Williamsport he now resides with
his wife and children in Mifflin-
burg. SP/5 Wagner entered the
Army in November 1952. After
taking his basic training at Breck-
inridge, Ky., he was shipped to
Korea. Prior to coming to Buck-
neH, SP/5 Wagner was in France

and transla- |

directed and acted by Professor
Harvey Powers a year ago. It
has since enjoyed a successful run
off Broadway.
Limitations Set

Those writing for the contest
should keep in mind that the play
will be presented in Coleman A-
1102 or Bucknell Hall and should
be aware of the limitations in
special scenery and lighting ef-
fects. Also, it is preferable that
the size of the cast should be
small. ‘

The -Bucknell Debate Society

lopened its second semester pro-
gram with a remarkable 4-2 rec-

{February 3-4. The four wins
| against two losses were sufficient

| to raise Bucknell to ‘fourth place | °

Usually Bucknell participates in

four-may tournaments. It is cus-

agent and a New Vorks | Omeny in such’ tourneys for two

men to uphold the resolution
while the other two speak in be-
half of the opposition. The tour-
nament at Johns Hopkins was|
unique in that only two men com

posed the entire team—Al De-

Prince and Maurice Nernberg. It|
was the duty of this team to al- |
ternate between the affirmative |
d negative sides of the issue

The two men debate three rounds |
in support of the topie goncerning

{health insurance for all citizens}

as well as three founds against}
the resolution and in support of {

DePrince and Nernberg went |
undefeated while supporting the |
negative beliefs. These debaters |
defeated St. Vincents of Latrobe,
Pa., Princeton University, and)
Syracuse University in three suc-|
cessive negative rounds. While |
upholding the affirmative issues, |
victory came only once. Bucknell |
was successful against Mary-}

HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?

Today let us address ourselves tog question that has long rocked
and roiled the academie world: Is a student better off at a
small college than at a large colleg

To answer this question it is necess

What,

ary first to define terms.

xactly, do we mean by a small college? Well sir, some say

that in order to be called truly small, a college should have an
enrollment of not moré than four students.

I certainly have no quarrel with this statement; a four-
student college must unquestionably be called small. Indeed,
one could even call it. intime if one knew what tntime meant.
But I submit there is such a thing as being too small. Take, for

>, 2recent unfortunate occurrence at Crimscott A and M.

scott brothers ne

thei s—and

went without potatoes for one single day of
nighty grateful they

were! One night, full of

gratitude after a hearty meal of French fries, cottage hash
browns, and au gratin, they decided to show their

enrollment should pever exceed four students

because they felt that only by keeping the college this small

the lulthav we

could each student be assured of the personalized attention, the
_ eamaraderie, the feeling of belonging, that is all too often lacking

in higher education.

Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday a
few years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football was,
of course, something of a problem at Crimscott, what with only
four students enrolled in the.entire college. It was easy enough
to muster a backfield, but finding a good line—or even a bad
line—baffled the most resourceful coaching minds in the country -

Well sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota,
its traditional rival, a capricious destiny dealt Crimscott a cruel
blow—in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,
woke up that morning with the breakbone fever. Wrichards, the

slotback, was uns
the wingback-tail

le to start his motorcycle. Beerbohm-Tree,
ack. got his necktie caught in his espresso

machine. Langerhans, the fullback, was stolen by gypsies.
Consequently, alas, none of the Crimscott team showed up at
the game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to score
almost at will. Crimscott was so out of sorts that they immedi-
ately broke off football relations with Minnesota, its traditional
rival. This later became known as the Dred Seott Decision.
So you can see how only four students might be too small an
enrollment. The number I ‘personally favor is twenty. How
come? Because when you have twenty students and one of
them opens a pack of Marlboro Cigarettes, there are enough to
go around for everybody, and no one has to be deprived of
Marlboro’s fine, mild flavor, of Marlboro’s easy-drawing filter,
of Marlboro’s joy and zest and steadfast companionship, and
as a result you have a student body that is filled with sweet
content and amity and harmony and concord and togetherness

and soft pack and flip-top box.

That’s how come.

Tiros has broadened man’s’ scope of the heavens
al and earth. From an orbiting observation post high
in the sky, it transmits a new wealth of meteorolog-

of Saturn
large as the entire earth |

ical information to earth-bound stations below.

Tiros is only one of many RCA successes in the
wide, wide world of electronics. And as the horizons
of electronics steadily expand, the need for more
and more competent and- creative engineers in-,
creases in direct ratio. That’s why RCA, now in
the forefront of electronic progress, offers such
tremendous opportunities for Electrical Engineers,
Mechanical Engineers, and Physicists. —

lf you already know what you want to do in
engineering ...and are qualified, RCA can offer
you direci assignments in your chosen field, and
back you up with training and guidance by ex-
perienced engineers.

If you’re not quite sure which direction you want
to go... RCA’s Design and Development Special-

Bisons Meet Strong Westminster Tonight Second Half Rally Fails,

Bucknell’s basketball team willO
be out to end a four game losing |
streak tonight when they take on
the Westminster Titans at Davis
Gym. Westminster visits Lewis-
burg with an impressive 13-2 rec-
ord, including victories over Pitt,
76-61, and Baldwin-Wallace, 73-
59, mutual opponents of the 9-7
Bisons.

Junior guard, Ron Galbreath,
will be the big gun for the Titans.
The 6-0 native of Wampum, Pa.,
is averaging 20.2 points per game; |
6-3 Warren Sallade has posted a
149 average, while 6-3 Jack
Steele and 6-1 Bill Douds have
netted 12.4 and 11.1, respectively.
Westminster plays only six men
regularly, with 6-5 Lou Skurcen-
ski and Steve Stolarik, 6-3 native
of Star Junction, Pa., taking care
of most of the board work.

Westminster has lost but two
games, both to Geneva College,
by ond and two points. They're
averaging 80 points a game offen-
sively, while holding their oppon-
ents to a mere 60.3 markers per
contest. They’ve. won six in a
row. ?

Bucknell has lost only one game
in Davis. Gym this season, the
opener to Geitysburg. The Bisons
have lost two straight games since
losing Dick Kniffen, but soph Sam
Penrose has had 37 points in the
one and two point losses to Get-
tysburg and Penn State. With
Penrose picking up the slack, the
local quintet should be ready to
end their second longest streak of
the season.

‘Penn State

by Mike Feigenbaum

Buckneli dropped another close
decision Tuesday night, losing a
65-63 squeaker up at Penn State.
| Although they had beaten State
jearlier in the year, 71-67, the
|Bisons were underdogs in this
| encounter because of the ineligi-
bility of co-captain Dick Kniffin.
| However the bad luck was equal-
ized early in the first half when
Mark Dumars, the State spark-
plug, suffered a badly sprained
ankle.

From the opening minutes of
the first half the, Bisons trailed
the Nittany Lions, managing only
to tie the score 8 times througout
the game. State, using its usual
|2-3 zone, capitalized on the in-
ability of the Bisons to hit on the
good shots, and a lack of move-
ment against the zone to open up
a 7 point half time lead, 32-25

State Up Twelve

State began the second half
with a 3-2 zone press, and extend-
ed their lead to 12 points, 42-30.
With 17 minutes left to play in
the ball game, sophomore Sam
Penrose hit the hoop for 7 straight
points and closed the gap to 44-39.
After State’s Gene Harris and
BU’s Joe Steiner, high scorers in
the game with. 20 points each, ex-
changed baskets, the Biisons rip-
ped off 8 straight points to tie the
game at 48 all with only 9 min-
utes remaining. From that point
on BU managed to just about
match State basket for basket
until, with only 3 minutes left,
they drew within one point, 62-
61, on a one-hander by Bruce
Babich. The Lions then went into
a freeze and converted on 3 foul
shots as the Bisons tried desper-
ately to get the ball. Steiner hit
for a shart jump with 15 seconds
to go for the fin
game, but it w
keep the Bisons from dropping
their fone in a row.

Maynard Ferguson’s Orchestra Seise* sot
To Feature ‘Fire and Drive’

by Gary Langford

One week from today, Buck-
nellians will have the privilege of |
hearing one of the greatest bands |
of our time, Maynard Ferguson ;
and hig Orchestra. Ferguson is |
considered by many to be the
greatest trumpet player today.

In the Down Beat poll of 1951)
he won the “favorite trumpeter”
division, and in 1952 the same}
honor was bestowed upon him for |
his work with the Stan Kenton;
band. In 1959, his newly formed
band was chosen as the top “New
Star Band” in the Down Beat In-
ternational Jazz Critics Poll His
policy of “jazz for dancing” has
made him extremely popular with
college dance crowds across the |
country.

Maynard Ferguson was born in
Canada. He started his musical
career with piano and violin les-|
sons at the age of four at the|
French Conservatory of Music in
Montreal, Canada. Later he
studied saxophone, trombone and
clarinet.
nine years old that he began to:
study trumpet.
was 15 years old, he was already
fronting a big band in which
many of the members were twice
their leader’s age.

Canadian Star

Maynard became known as a
trumpet virtuoso in Canada long
before he left for the United)

tates to join Boyd Raeburn’s
band. It was during his period
with Stan Kenton that Maynard
took the public by storm. It
rapidly became evident that May-
nard Ferguson was one of the
most remarkable technicians on
trumpet—perhaps the most re-

in history.
2r trumpeters had hit notes
as high as those Maynard was
le to reach. But the key word |
s “hit”; they could hit that
upper register, but they could not
there. For whereas with
uch high notes were
squeals to be reached

ard was able to work

and accurately at

that register. The Kenton band
had parts written especially

ja band with five

One of the memorable sights
in jazz was to see Maynard, with
Kenton’s Innovations in Mddern
Music orchestra, sitting in the
trumpet section, casually playing
impossible parts without turning
a hair or revealing by any ges-
ture that what he was doing was
almost unbelievable.

As Stan Kenton once said,
“There are few trumpet players
that are able to create a feeling
of fire. We're lucky to have one:
Maynard Ferguson.”

It was inevitable that Maynard
would form a band of his own.
And, after a stint as a studio mu-
sician in Hollywood, he did—in
1956. ‘

Classical Trumpet

Maynard is one of the most ver- |

satile musicians to ever step into
the spotlight of big-band jazz.
After gaining proficiency on the
trombone, he laid it aside to con-
centrate on trumpet. But in re-
cent years, he has been playing

the instrument again, both valve,

and slide trombone. Perhaps the
high water mark in demonstra~
tions of Maynard's versatility

came last year when he was fea- |

tured as soloist with the New
York Philharmonic in William
Russon’s Symphony No, 2.

The New York critics, used to
the limitations of classical bra
men, were astonished by Maynard

—perhaps mystified is the better}

Maynard’s Band

There is one feature about May-
s band that distinguis! it
from all others. He uses only 12
cluding himself. This
possible because of
ability to fill in on one
of his instruments: He has
stated his reason for using 12 men
instead of the usual 18 “In the
old big band days it was not un-
common for an 18-piece orchestra
to have only two or three good
soloists. Now, nearly all the
young jazz musicians want fo ex-

semble. I find that 12 men can
give me the “bigness” I want and
|I can operate better at very fast
{tempos when it comes to swing-
ing because essentially it's lighter
than larger orchestras.”

Using the works of Willie Mai-
den, his arranger, one of his tenor
‘saxophone players, and Slide
|Hampton, one of his trombone
| players, Maynard’s band plays
{with a fire and drive uncommon
‘to most other! big bands.

Student Organist
Displays Excellence

by Joanne Harris

This past Sunday evening af-}

forded an hour of musical enjoy-
ment for the many who attended
the sénior organ recital presented
by David Lyon of Elmira, New
York. Mr. Lyon’s performance
displayed a mastery of technique
as well as a musical understand-
ing of the composition and the
instrument.

The program opened with the
G minor Prelude and Fugue by
Bach. The majority of the Pre-
lude provided an excellent open-
ing for the program.
Fugue, Mr. Lyon’s registration
permitted the listener to follow
the intricate form of the composi-
tion with comparative ease.

In the B minor Chorale by
Caesar Franck, Mr. Lyon showed
particularly well an understand-
ing of the expr ve elements in
the music. Again through the
performer's effective registration
and articulation one was aware of
the theme throughout the com-
posith

Giraudoux’s Amphitryon 38:

by Valerie McCarthy |
Last weekend’s production of |
‘Jean Giraudoux’s Amphitryon 38 |
was a successful collegiate at-|
tempt at sophisticated drama. To!
do justice to this intellectually |
profound, yet highly comic play, |
a great deal of comprehension as |
well as competence is requisite. |
| However, we must view the Cap |
and Dagger presentation as a}
work accomplished by undergrad- |
juates, and, not by a professional |
acting group.

Probably, the most praise-_
worthy element of this production
was its technical achievement.
The sets designed by Nancy Dia-,
;mond were not only effective in
| ereating the illusion of vast depth,
| but also very appealing to the eye. |
|The background scene appeared |
|to be painted on a filmy material
j—very appropriate to the “up in
the clouds” atmosphere of the
jearthly setting. An impressionis-
itie rendering of Mt. Olympus in
|purple was offset by shades of
| sky-blue.
| Plaster Cloud {
| The Deus ex Machina plaster of |
|Paris cloud-contrivance was an
ingenious, if not wholly success-.
ful, idea. Jupiter and Mercury
arrived safely at the land of mor-
itals by cloud, but were apparent-
ly unable to get off the ground at
the close.

Another interesting technical
scheme was the utter dependence
on lighting instead of curtains to
indicate the opening and closing
of sce As a result, the audi-
ence was never rudely divorced
from the anthropomorphic and
mortal masqueradings.

» frolicsome Jupiter, played
by Landis Coffman, is enlightened

elity, portrayed by Nancy

SPECIAL OFFER...

Successful Attempt at Comedy

Diamond, on the human concepts
of love, friendship, and trust. The
god of the sky is introduced to
the effect of mortality on love, as
opposed to his own blase and
elemental notions about sexual
relationships. Indeed, these puz-
zling confrontations cause the god
to develop a wrinkle on his brow.
Jupiter's Sidekick

Sandy Schumacher's fine por-
trayal of Mercury, Jupiter’s mis-
chievous sidekick, evoked a good

{deal of laughter from. the audi-

ence. His timing and inflection
were excellent. Hans Russell, as
Trumpeter, also provided the aa-
dience with mirth. Cathy Olerio
proved herself to be “a natural”
and a competent actress in her
performance as Leda.

Joe LoGrippo, as the cuckholded
Amphitryon, and Marv Kahan, as
his servant Sosie, were sufficient
for their parts. Gay Pulley, as
Kleantha, Violet Dunworth, as
Nenetza, and Ron Carey, as War-
rior, were adequate in supporting
roles.

Although his facial expressions
were excellent, Landis Coffman
could have done more with his
voice. Nancy Diamond succeed-
ed in portraying Alkmena as a
strong-willed and noble aristocrat.
but her performance would have
been improved by more practice
with voice pitch and tone.

In general, Amphitryon 38 was
enjoyed by those who attended
the produetion. However, aside
from a few high spots in the act-
ing, the staging and scenery were
the most commendable features.
The production staff can rest as-
sured that all of their hard work
was worthwhile.

THE CONSERVATIVE MIND |

From Burke to Santayana |
by Russell Kirk: Regnery |
(Chicago, 1953). $6.50.
In this highly ~controversial |

book, Mr. Kirk has reviewed the |
writings of a selected group of}
British and American thinkers
since 1789 and defined their po-
litical and social tendencies as
conservatve.

As for himself, Mr. Kirk strong-
ty advocates a conservatism in
the tradition of Burke based on a
religious view of the world and
human life and respectful of
prejudice in morals and prescrip-
tion in law, as the products of
social experience under Providen-
tial guidance. Anything which
interferes with the steady flow of
History as the English Reform

Bill of 1832 or the American Civil
War is termed “catastrophic”.
Even “industrialism” is attacked
as if it were some new liberal fad,

and Marxism are not identical...”
Mr. Thomas finds no positive

tions
“There is a class solidarity which
is not an absolute or exclusive
principle binding man in social
action but which has great
force.” And “It is not true that
increasing misery inevitably
means revolution—certainly not a
democratic revolution.”

These remarks are as democrat-
ic as they are Socialist and offer
no emotional basis for any great
mass movement. As the author
writes, “I have assured no class,
race, or nation of its own perfec-
tion or its messianic destiny.”

Results of Wisconsin Program
Show First Semester Counts

A university student's first se-
mester grades give a better indi-
cation of his ultimate success than
either his high school rank or his
score on an examinaton. That’s
a tentative finding of a study of
grades of former college students
being made by F. Chandler
Young, assistant dean .of the Col-
lege of Letters and Science at the
University of Wisconsin.

The first phase of a long term
research effort, the study des-
cribes the scholastic progress
made by 4,000 new freshmen who
entered the University in Septem-
ber of 1950 and 1951. Dean Young
cautions -that the conclusions
“have not as yet been rigidly test-
ed.”

earning ‘B’; for the 305 selected
by the ACE score, 78 per cent
were present and 58 per cent were
earning ‘B’.”

“Similar results were found for
the least promising students,” he
added. Dean Young suggests that
a student does not need a whole
year after high school to become
‘accustomed to university life.
| While the finding held true for
| both men and women, there were
\differences in their progress.
“Men persist longer than women,”
he said. Some 44 per cent of the
men completed eight semesters
and only 35 per cent of the women
finished eight consecutive semes-
ters. But, mere women than men
earned “B” grades.

“The student's record after he,

gets to college tells a much better \e oF ‘aculty Awards
story than pre-college data,” he|

explained. Usng ‘College of Let-

SFC --- Yawn?

Student government at Bucknell has, for many years,
been a subject of general dismay, but in 1958, there ap-
peared on the scene an idealistic student who began writ-
ing letters to leaders of various organizations asking them
what they were doing—a most impertinent gesture. In
a minor campus revolution this atypical individual was
elected president of the Student Faculty Congress.

His administration managed to eliminate the modest
stipends given to such persons as editor of L’Agenda and
the Bucknellian, to start cleaning up the cumbersome and
ineffective group known as the social committee, and to
send some individuals to, other schools for discussion of
common problems and to bring back suggestions. His,
successor, an unknown independent and a dark horse, car-
ried on in the same spirit, completely eliminating the, so-
cial committee and turning decisions on such problems
over to the personnel deans, streamlining the methods of
distributing student funds and implementing one sugges-
tion of the previous years’ group which had visited other
schools by establishing a system of student evaluation of
faculty.

The present student administration has lacked a percep-
tion of its role as well as initiative in pursuing it. Al-
though a resolution has been passed to create a committee
of students to advise the SFC and the Dean of the Univer-
sity on academic matters, the SFC this year has had little
concept of anything else to do. Its major activity has
been the revision of an overly bulky constitution by elim-
inating one of the two bodies that compose SFC.

It is to the credit of the present SFC that it is eliminat-
ing some governmental machinery that is not needed and
that it has passed the proposa! for an academic committee.
There are, however, a number of things which discredit it.
The officers of SFC have failed to carry out the annual
leadership conference held each September at Cowan,
which is the only major opportunity for all student lead-
ers to assemble as such and to conside
specifically the problems of the University. They have
failed to distribute the forms for student evaluation of
faculty that were devised by the previous ‘administration.
Their publicity has been negligible, even less than merit-
ed by the little they have to publicize; they-have given
the campus even less of an idea of their work than they
have allowed themselves. In a month and a half, they
have failed to answer a scathing Bucknellian editorial
that pointedly asked them if they were doing anything.

The purpose of this editorial is-to point out that student
government in the last three years has NOT been doing
NOTHING. It has been sleepily evaluating itself, and
slowly but unsurely streamlining itself, eliminating much
functionless or ill-functioning machinery. The present
government has been sleepiest in its attempts. The last
three years have seen an attempt to recognize student
government’s limited role in the power structure of the
University and to utilize its full potential. We hope that
the present and following student administrations will
speed up this work and move to new projects,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor:

I find that the students at
Bucknell have been unjustly ac- |
cused of apathy, of lack of inter- |
est in cultural affairs, and of pre- |
occupation with the trivial at the |
Stu-|
dent attendance at the produc-|
tions last weekend of Candida,

tion. |
In all fairness to the few stu-|
who .did not attend, it;

: |
impose fines on;

How-,
impositions are not
the 800 men and
women who’ do not belong to
Furthermore,
all freshmen who are in the pro-
cess of joining fraternal groups
were released from their social
obligations in time to attend the
plays. Thus approximately 1000!
Bucknell students could have at-
tended the plays withont incur-
ring a fine.

Despite the press of more in-
tellectual commitments, and de-
spite the icy weather which ren-
dered the trip from dormitories
to Coleman Hall unusually haz-
ardous, it is estimated that nearly
30 students attended the prduc-
tion of Candida on Friday even-
ing, and more than twice that
number went to see Volpone on
Saturday. Such overwhelming i
evidence of student interest in and

such

‘support of the theatre deserves

the commendation of both admin-
istration and faculty, and should
serve to redouble the efforts of
those responsible for attracting |
professional artists to the univer- |
sity. |
It would have warmed the}
cockles of the most cynical peda-
gogical heart to watch the droves |
of eager students making their}

ed to attend Bucknell but were
rejected for various reasons. One
problem that I have found is that
the majority of Negroes do not
know about Bucknell at all, for
Bucknell’ has not been presented
to them. Also, the high schools
from which many Bucknellians
came have many _ substantial
Negro students who would like to
come here—for the education
which we pride ourselves in be-
ing able to give, and as a chal-
lenge so to speak—but they are
not approached.

To cite examples of these high
schools let us look at the schools
in Westchester County and Long
Island in New York, East High
School in Rochester, New York,
Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, and
Pittsburgh High Schools, Elmira,
(N. Y.) Free Academy, and the
Philadelphia area schools. I am

Mr. Zeller has based his state-
ment upon two points—social and
economic—as the reason for the
lack of Negroes at Bucknell, dis-
missing the Admission aspect
entirely.
there are some tacit assumptions
which should be cleared up by
someone in the midst of the situ-

Many Negroes are of the middle
and lower income brackets, but
many are of the upper brackets
and would send their children
here, knowing the situation—for
there are others who think as I
do. In order to change the whole
American aspect it is necessary
for parents to send their children
here knowing how things are. We
are not searching for an easy way
out, but we are striving to let ed-
ucated persons accept us as edu-
cated equals. Many Negro
parents disapprove of all Negro
colleges for the reason it is an
escape from the reality of the
“American way”. °After visiting

Yes, because if there were more
Negroes on the Bucknell team,
these fellows would, be less prone
to do these things. I agree fully
with Mr. Zeller’s suggestion of
having the Bucknellian start by
doing what it can do to insure
a favorable climate for those
“foreign” students who are here
now and this will be an accom-
plishment in itself.

The most embarrassing situa-
tion I find that I have encounter-
ed from my years at Bucknell, is
the reaction that so many persons
have shown when I tell them that
I am one of two or three Negro
students at Bucknell University
(population approximately 2,400),

‘ta GUIDE FOR THE DATELESS”

With the cost of dating rising higher and higher it is no wonder
that so many of us men are turning to discus throw

ally, we would prefer nuzzling warm coeds to flinging cold
disci, but who's got that kind of money? Prices being what they
are, the average man today has a simple choice or eating.

Unless the average man happens to be Finster ifoos.

Finster came to college with the normal ambition of any
average man: he wanted to find the prettiest coed on-campus
and make her his. He looked long and carefully, and at last.he
found her—a tall job named Kretchma Inskip, with hair like
beaten gold.

He asked her for a date. She accepted. He appeared at her
sorority house that night, smiling, eager, and carrying a bouquet
of modestly priced flowers.

“Now then,” said Kretchma, tossing the sleazy flora to a
pledge, “where are we going tonight?”

Finster was a man short on cash, but long on ideas. He had
prepared an attractive plan for this evening. “How would you
like to go out to the Ag campus and see the milking machine?”
he asked.

“Tek,” she replied.

“Well, what would you like to do?” he asked.

“Come,” said she, “toa funny little place I know just outside
of town.”

And away they went.

/

as yes rs per ALAS
the aera Wa? OLY hy 2 Siampe Caw:

The place was Millionaires Roost, a simple country inn made
of solid ivory. It was filled with beautiful ladies in backless
gowns, handsome men in dickeys. Original Rembrandts adorned
the walls. Marlboro trays adorned the cigarette girls. Chained
to each table was a gypsy violinist.

Finster and Kretchma were seated. “I,” said Kretchma to
the waiter, “will start with shrimps remoulade. Then I will have
lobster and eapon in maderia sauce with asparagus spears. For
dessert I will have melon stuffed with money.”

“And you, id the waiter to Finster.

“Just bring me a pack of Marlboros,” replied Finster, ‘for
if ever a man needed to settle back and enjoy the mild benefi-
cence of choice tobacco and easy-drawing filtration, it is the
shattered hulk you see before you now.”

So, smoking the best of all possible cigarettes, Finster watched
Kretchma ingest her meal and calculated that every time her
fetching young Adam's apple rose and fell, he was out another
97¢. Then he took her home.

it was while saying goodnight that Finster got his brilliant
idea. “Listen!” he cried excitedly. ‘I just had a wonderful
notion. Next time we go out, let’s go Dutch treat!”

By way of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with
her housemother and stormed into the house.

“Well, the heck with her,” said Finster to himself. “She is
just a gold digger and I am well rid of her. I am sure there are
many girls just as beautiful as Kretchma who will understand
the justice of my position. For after all, girls get as much
money from home as men, so what could be more fair than
sharing expenses on a date?”

With good heart and high hopes, Finster began a search for
a girl who would appreciate the equity of Dutch treat, and you
will be pleased to hear that he soon found one—Mary Alice
Hematoma, a lovely three-legged girl with sideburns.

Swimming in friendly waters
for the third time this season, the
natators of Bucknell University
splashed to a 53.5—41.5 decision
over the. Yniversity of Pennsyl-
vania last Saturday.

The ‘Bisons opened up a quick
lead and then held on for dear
life as the Red and Blue swim-
mers captured seven firsts in the
11-event contest.

Although Bucknell has hurt
themselves in recent meets be-
cause of their inability to capture
the relay events this was not the
case on Saturday and proved to
be the margin of victory. The
Orange and Blue opened the meet
by besting the Philadelphians in
the 400 yd. medley relay. Bill
Dearstyne (backstroke), Chuck
Maunz (breaststroke), Skip Can-
non (butterfly), and Frank Wood
(freestyle) covered the distance in
4:09.5 giving the BU Bisons a 7-0
lead.

Steiner’s Record 31 Doesn’t Beat Owls PINNED, 26-6

The Bison basketball team won
its tenth game of the season last
Frday night when they stopped
the Westminster Titans 91-82 at
‘Davis Gym. Big Hal Smoker rip-
ped the cords for 34 points, season
high for a Bison, -as, Bucknell
broke a six game winning streak
by the Western Pennsylvania
squad.

“Big Smoke” connected on 15
of 20 tries from the field and add-
ed 4/of.5 shots from the free
throw line. The 6-6, 230 pound
sophomore from Columbia, Pa.,
also pulled down 17 rebounds,
second high total for a Buckell
player this season. Bruce Babich,
hitting on 10 of 13 shots from the |
field, \collected 25 as Joe Steiner |
was held to 8 points below his}
average, netting 13.

The visiting Titans outshot the
Bisons 51% to 49% with each
team taking an equal number of
shots. Bucknell wrecked West- |
minster’ hopes of a_ seventh
straight win on the foul line, by
sinking 23 of 25 charity tosses.
The visitors Ron Galbreath, 6-1
senior, from Wampum, Pa., threw
in 17 of 27 from the field and scor-
ed on all six opportunities on the
free throw line, to tally 40 points.
It was the best scoring exhibition
by a viisiting player this year, but
four points short of the floor rec-
ord set by Jesse Arnell of Penn
State. Smoker’s performance was

The Bison basketball team plays '

host to one of the top teams in
the country next Wednesday
night when they take on the St.
Joseph Hawks from Philadelphia.
The Bucknell team, despite the
advantage of the home floor, will
be rated underdogs to a team that
has won 18 games and lost 4.

The highly rated Hawks have
pulled some of the most stunning
upsets of the season with victories
over St. Johns, Wake Forrest,
Seton Hall and Villanova, but
have blown some easier contests
to Pitt and Dayton.

The big wheel in the St. Joe’s
machine is 6-6 Jack Egan, who
has been averaging about 23
points per contest. The confident
senior from Bethlehem, Pa., hit a
season high of 47 against Gettys-
burg. Vince Kempton, 6-8, “The

The basketball team takes on
the University of Buffalo tomor-

will be the first of two important
home games. Buffalo is one of

The Cleveland Players Pace Was Slow;
Some Bright Places Saved The Show!

by Janet Creswick

Shaw’s Candida, presented by
The Cleveland Play House last
Friday, gained comic momentum
very slowly, and in some cases
painfully. The audience was ex-
tremely small and somewhat scat-
tered, and this may have inhibit-
ed the performance during the
first act when the players and the
audience were mutually unre-
sponsive.

Candida, the wife of Rev. James
Morell, is the wise and witty,
eminently Shavian female, who
mothers and masters two men and
then asserts her right not to
choose between them. Adale

O’Brien is consistently good as
Candida. When she enters for}
her first scene her red hair and |
regal bearing seem to shatter}
Shaw’s maternal character but!
throughout the play her tone and |
timing and gestures bear out!
Shaw’s original. She is not as
genuinely comic as the other
characters in the play but she is
undoubtedly the springboard for
all their highest humor.

Morell’s Role

Morell, her husband, condemns
Candida’s mild realism, terming
her judicious perspectives ‘un-
comfortable realism’. Eugene
Marchbanks, a potential poet and
Briton smitten by Candido, never |
realizes that Candida catches the!
core of his ‘poetic truths’ and sal-
vages his insights from his melo-
drama.

Of Works in Senior Recital

On Sunday evening, the largest
audience to attend a senior recital |

very rich and sonorous effect. |

surrounding interwoven voices.

Chopin’s tragic Sonata in B flat |

mantic nature of the performer. |
The listener was. carried along in|
the sweeping development of the |
themes. However, Miss Rutledge |
at times seemed to become a bit |

her absorption. This was pri- |

marily due to the extremely poor |
acoustics of Vaughan Literature |

In the intermittent lyric pas-
ages, she achieved a most de-
lightful supporting blend with the |

the work, which the performer

GETTING DOWN TO CASES .. .WITH AN ELECTRONIC COMPUTER

Ayoung lawyer may spend many years searching through
the countless volumes in a law library before he ever
gets a chance to plead a case. His job is to research the
cases which may provide legal precedent. It’s a very

necessary but tedious

task.

Recently it was demonstrated that an IBM computer
could accomplish electronic retrieval of statutory law.
Nearly 2,000 statutes pertaining to a specific area of the
faw were stored in the computer's memory. In response
to inquiries, the computer searched its memory at elec-

tronic speed and on

instructions pointed) out either

citations or the full text of relevant statutes. This was,
accomplished in minutes. It might have taken a young

lawyer the entire day.

Three Choices }

Scholarly Kent Smith, former |
board chairman of Lubrizol Corp. |
amd acting president of Cleve-
land’s Case Institute of Technol-
ogy, said quietly, “We've got}
three choices: one, let the Com- |
munist countries surpass us; two,
let the federal government take;
over higher education; or three, }
previde from private sources the
money to develop the skills that
will keep us free and continually
improving our way of life.”

“Any real American is for num-
ber three,’ Dively exclaimed.
“Let's figure what to do about it
—and do it together!” .

What they figured out, after
months of discussion with other
corporate heads in Cleveland, was
a unique plan for aid to education
that could serve as a model for
every corporation and community

2 the land. The “Cleveland com- ;
pact” is the soul of simplicity—
and equity. It proposes that its
signers agree to “corporate con-
tributions commencing at once
and increasing within three years
to a minimum of one percent of
imcome before taxes, and there-
after gradually increasing as the
need develops.”

The powerful potential of this
simple agreement is seen in the!
fact that, under the compact, the |
first 21 signers alone will produce
more than two million dollars a/
year for higher education. Should
ecerporations generally follow}
Cieveland’s lead, more than a half |
billion badly needed dollars would
flow annually into our needy col- |
leges and universities. i

Though no publicity attended |
the plan’s inauguration, news of |
the Cleveland action soon spread.
The Board of Governors of Asso- |
ciated Colleges of Indiana—a'
pioneer organization in promoting |
aid to education—began consider- |
ing ways of applying the Cleve-|
land idea to the whole state of |
Indiana. Other communities con- |
sidering action are Cincinnati, St.

Corporations Cooperate

To a sizable number of Cleve-
land corporations such arguments
have been convincing. Besides
the 21 who had signed up by No-
yember last, many others, with
he endorsement of management,
were awaiting final action by
their boards of directors.

Charles E. Spahr, president of
The Standard Oil Co. (Ohio),
whose philosophy is shared by his
board of directors, says, “There’s
no such thing as continued pros-

a declining America. Keeping the
country educationally strong is a
vital interest of American busi
ness.”

How do the Clevelanders allot
their contributions? In addition
to earmarking gifts for scholar-
ships, faculty salaries, support of
professorships and basic research,
new and imaginative ways of giv-
ing are being discovered.

Matching Plan

One popular scheme is the
“matching” plan, in which a firm
matches any employee’s contribu-
tion to his college up to, say, $1000
a year. And one Cleveland com-
pany has come up with an effec-
tive gimmick to encourage dili-
gence in its sponsored students.
This is “conditional support.” A

Festival Quartet
Called Sensitive’

by Beverly Anderson and’

Linda Gagliardi
| Bucknell University was host
{to the Festival Quartet on Tues.
evening at the Davis Gym Annex.
|This outstanding group is com-
|prised of Victor Babin, piano;
Szyman Goldberg, violin; William
Primrose, viola, and Nikolai
Graudan, cello.

The program opened with
Dvorak’s Quartet in E flat Major,
Opus 87, which was followed by
the Quartet in G Minor by Mo-
zart. Because of faulty acoustics,
the sounds did not seem to pro-
ject in a unified manner. In spite
of this, the overall blend was
fairly homogenous, although the
piano overpowered the strings in
some portions. In the Lento
movement of the Dvorak Quartet,
Mr. Graudan executed a most ef-
fective cello solo. Varieties of
dynamic range were sensitively
performed.

The ensemble sound was excel-
lent in Schumann’s Quartet in E
flat Major, Opus 47. The piano
seemed more in rapport with the
total sound. Melodious cello and

Graudan in a delightful cello solo

The program was a full one

that Mr. Primrose and Mr. Grau-

Here’s one filter cigarette that’s really different!

The difference is this: Tareyton’s Dual Filter gives you a
unique inner filter of ACTIVATED CHARCOAL, definitely proved to
make the taste of a cigarette mild and smooth. It works together with

a pure white outer filter—to balance the flavor elements in the smoke.
Tareyton delivers—and you enjoy—the best taste of the best tobaccos.

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1961.

tion at that university. The
crushing of lighted cigarette butts
in the hair of the Negro girls tak-
ing part in the Sit-Ins in Nash-
ville didn’t provoke them to anger
nor scare them from, seeking the
goal they finally achieved.

Yes, a Bucknellian did insult
and attack a Negro athlete from
another school, but this fellow
also insulted and embarrassed two |
Bucknell girls previously that
day. For his actions at the game
and all that went before, he was
dismissed from school. The same
punishment should be administer-
ed to anyone who so discredits
the name of Bucknell.

In the realm of athletics, yes,
the academic requirements at
Bucknell are very stiff for many
athletes. Even though a few of
our athietes are on the Dean’s
List, many are in academic
trouble and some are fiunking
out. I’m sure there are Negro
athletes who can do at least that}
well at Bucknell. {

The Bucknell coaches are here |
to produce good teams in their |
respective sports. In order to do}
this, they do try to get the best |
men they can to come to Buck- |
nell. I very seriously doubt that, |
if a coach wanted a particular
very good athlete who happened
to be a Negro to play on his team,
would refuse to bring him here, |
just because of the social difficul- |
ties he might face. I have been |
on the swimming team for four}
years now. Granted, I am tired
and worn out when I leave prac- |
tice. But I am not more tired
than my teammates, solely be-
cause I have to bear some addi-
tional pressure imposed upon me
because of my race as stated by
Mr. Zeller.

The social situation has always

and will always be a touchy sub-
ject in most interracial relations. |

No matter where one looks, on j*

pus or off, people will be
found to fit into three classes in |
their relation with minority
groups. There are those who truly
accept all people as equals; those |
who go to extremes to demon-
strate their liberalism; and also
those who won't even speak.
Bucknell isn’t unique in having
these types of people, and most
Negroes will not be suprised to
find them here. |

Many Bucknellians might ask
why would Negroes want to come
to a school like Bucknell with all
its limitations. Well I’ve been
closely associated with many dif-
ferent colleges. I spent a semes-
ter 4t Howard University in
Washington, D. C. and I’ve known
students at Syracuse U. for four
years. My sister has attended
Fisk University in Nashville,
Tenn., Oberlin College as an ex-
change student and now Univer-
sity of chigan. At each one of
these schools students have com-
plaints about the social life. The
grass is not always greener.

Here at Bucknell I know stu-
dents whe have left, because the
social life has not been to their
liking. And just think, Bucknell
is supposed to be one of the best
schools for “catching a mate”.
Even with this ideal mating situ-
ation many Bucknellians do not
take advantage of it and go
through four years pinned off
campus. So it would be foolish
for any mature person to base his
selection of a college solely on its
social acceptability. Furthermore
nearly every. Negro student ex-
pects that in an interracial society
there will be inconsistencies. It’s
what you make out of what you
have where you have it that
counts. Those who can overlook
prejudice and-ignorance can see
a pleasant life.

Yes, I do agree with calling for
a favorable social climate in
which the new African student
may live next year. It must be
remembered that Africans are
proud of their color, their race,
their nationality and have never
felt that blackness deserved
second-rate tr nt. Whereas
most American N es are cal-
loused to the inconsistencies in}
cur society, Africans are not. }

This African fellow will be!
soon living in a new society and}
asking many questions about the}
society. He will recall in his!
mind that inthe society outside |
this campus the Negro population |
is 10%. In cur society on cam-

ous it is presently 0.1%. Will he!
‘eel the effects of a difference of |
30 much for so long? Can the:
Bucknell society, so long compos- |
ed of one socio-economic group)
nake a favorable social climate!
for him? I hope so. _ If it can,
then it is absolutely foolish for |
people to think that past incidents |
on Bucknell’s campus will scare |
away American Negroes seeking |
an education. If it can’t, then it
is dangerous for this school and
for this country to think that stu-
dents educated in this type of
tight. socio-economic society can
be successful in a world where
two-thirds of the people have
dark skin.

Until the attitude is dismissed
that Bucknell is an undesirable
place to have a number of Negro
students, there will never be more
than a few. Granted there is
not ‘a very large number of
Negroes who can financially af-
ford Bucknell and can academic- |
ally qualify, but I know there
are many more than two.

Sincerely,
Frank Wood ’61

However corporations bestow
their gifts, they can go far toward
rescuing higher education from
the plight in which the President's
Committee on Education Beyond
the High School finds it. “The
gap between this nation’s educa-
tional needs and its educational
effort is widening ominously,” the
committee declared. “World peace
and the survival of mankind may
well depend on the way to edu-
cate the citizens and leaders of to-
morrow.”

The irony thickens as each bird
of prey yields what is most preci-
ous to him to the fox, and finalty

crafty Volpone when he is sum-
moned by the court on a rape
charge.

Lynn Storer, as Mosca, plays a
crucial comic part, instigating and
integrating the multiple ironies
and subplots of the satire. As a
dramatic comedian he is at his best
in repartee. His brilliance seems
to be a short-winded thing. AU
of his longer, uninterrupted lines
were weak and unconvincing
compared to his conversational

trength.

Columba, admittedly a mild
foolish creature is not adequately
played by Sally Noble, who pro-
nounced Colomba’s immaturity to
the extent that the character
seemed simultaneously Christian
and unwholesome. Played too
forcefully, the part of the faithful
wife prostituted by an avaricious
and jealous husband, might have
wrecked the comic, tone of the
play. But I do think Sally Noble
might have beén more potent as
Colomba without reducing the
comedy to a pageant of evil.

Facts and Questions

It is not often that the Bucknellian answers a readers’
letter through an editorial. However we feel that Mr.
Zeller’s letter of February 6 is a special case.

We are sincerely sorry that our editorial angered Mr.
Zeller to the point that he felt strong language might help
an otherwise weak case. The Bucknellian did send a re-
porter to the admissions office last year, he was refused
the pertinent information on the basis that it was confi-
dential.

Mr. Zeller made the-point in his letter that there is no
University policy toward Negroes concerning admissions.
We sincerely hope that this statement doesn’t imply that
there are policies toward other racial or religious groups.
The letter argued that there simply aren’t enough “fiinan-
cially able Negroes to go around.” However, investiga-
tion shows that the Betty Ann Quinn Scholarship, which
contrary to Mr. Zeller’s-letter is specifically for Negroes,
is not being used at this time.

The letter made a valid point in its statement as to why
there are so few, indeed no, Negro athletes at Bucknell
However a boy by the name of Irwin Roberson who won
a silver medal for the United States in the recent Olym-
pics, applied for admission to Bucknell four years ago; he
was in the top quarter of his class, and a star football
player and trackman. He is a Negro; he wanted to come
to Bucknell; he was denied admission. This fact has been
supplied by a present Bucknell student who is a friend of
Roberson’s. It is entirely possible that there was some
perfectly valid reason for rejecting this boy. Unfortu-
nately it is not apparent.

We must accept Mr. Zeller’s statement that the social
climate at Bucknell is not as sympathetic to Negro stu-
dents as it might be. We wonder whether a continued
lack of Negro students will do anything to change this sit-
uation. Also, the social opportunities for Jews, Catholics,
Koreans, Burmese and other non-Anglo-Saxon Protestants
are really not much better. Yet each of these groups is
represented on the Bucknell campus. Now it seems, to
us, unfair to subject these groups to a narrow social life,,
while saving the Negro student from it. There appears
to be something wrong with Mr. Zeller’s reasoning on this
point.

We do agree with Mr. Zeller that the absence of a pho-
tograph from the application will not take prejudice out
of people’s hearts, but it certainly would be a step toward
attracting more Negro applicants, which Mr. Zeller agrees
would be a»more desirable goal than having them scared
away by the picture requirengent.

According to Mr. Zeller’s letter we have been “beating
the director of admissions.” We are extremely sorry if we
gave this impression. The Bucknellian is quite aware
that Mr. Walling and his staff are not in the position of
being directly responsible for admissions policies. How-
ever, somewhere at some time, there must take place a
discussion as to how the incoming freshman class will be
“distributed”. We must apologize to Mr. Walling; we
centered on the Admissions Office only because it is the
place where, if a policy of discrimination were existent,
it would be most blatantly manifest.

The Bucknellian is grateful for the response of its read-
ers in last week’s paper, and we hope that this important
question will not be allowed to escape us again.

Think: Then Vote

In the political structure of a university, students have
no power. They have influence over only those areas
granted them by the trustees or administration. In Buck-
nell’s case, they have been granted the privilege of limit-
ed self-government. This means that they can elect of-
ficers who meet as an official body, regulate drives for
funds, conduct such programs as Spring Festival and
freshman hazing, and sponsor the Artist Series.

All these things are presently done by the SFC, but
these are relatively minor administrative functions. The
most important thing an official representative body of
the students should do is to mold opinion, to deliberate
and evaluate. The rightful subject matter for such de-
liberation is in this case the academic and social welfare
of Bucknell as.an institution of higher learning. This im-
plies concerns within and among the students about not
only learning itself, but also their roles as citizens.

For this reason, concerned students should have a struc-
tural means of meeting together and considering issues
that are important to the learning experience and to pub-
lic citizenship. It is their position as an official body to
deliberate on issues that are important to the quality of
the university and to the public welfare. It is fitting for
them to consider issues carefully and, arriving at respon-
sible opinions, to publicize these opinions in an attempt
to move public sentiment behind them and ultimately
bring the measures into effect. It is to the credit of the
present SFC that it has established a committee on na-
tional and international issues. We hope that it will pur-
sue this end and broaden its role in the formation of cam-
pus opinion and in the fostering of responsible discussion
and opinion forming in all situations.

Who should be the leaders of such an organization?
They should first of all be responsible people who will
carry out their administrative duties effectively and will
not overstep their bounds in deliberation and declaration.
They should understand the meaning of the learning ex-
perience and be eager to support those measures which
improve it. They should understand the aims, and needs
of the students they represent. They should be aware of
social issues beyond the campus. In short, they should
be competent and responsible, moral and inte}lectual lead-
ers. Is this the type of person we have elected in the
past? Is it the type we are about to choose in the coming
elections?

To the President of the Univer-
sity, to the Student Body, and
to the Faculty:

In any society, in order to de-
velop the individual's intellect
and understanding of his fellow
man, there must be a variety of
people; not only in character
make-up, but in the variety of
races, religions, and creeds. For
this reason, the society of the
United States as a whole has al-
| ways been a rich and satisfying
| country to live in. In order to
enrich college life for students at
Bucknell, there must be a more
| heterogeneous student body. But
a heterogeneous student body can
only come about by the removal
of certain barriers that prevent
jindividual minority groups from
coming to Bucknell.

Before citing these barriers, we
would like to state our ultimate
Boal in writing this letter. It is
jour belief that any university can
‘improve, enlarge the nature of its
'education. This is not a personal
|attack against the administration
{nor any person in it, but we are
‘attempting to express our desire
'for some changes which we feel

would be beneficial to the stu-
jdents and the university. We
realize that in order to accom-

plish anything in this world it
|must be done in a calm and ma-
jture manner. Our goal is the
creation of a better Bucknell.
Our student body should be a

'natural accumulation of all types

‘of human beings. This can only

‘come about when certain ob-

|stacles are removed. We cannot

{expect individuals from minority

i}

groups to apply to an institution !

jsuch as Bucknell when they are
{made to feel unwanted. The
;presence on this campus of fra-
ternities and sororities that. dis-
| criminate is an impediment to the
inatural accumulation of a diver-
| sified student body.
ternities and sororities discrimin-
{ate because of national clauses
jand others because of tradition
at Bucknell,

| Today, this country and univer-

sity cannot afford to waste the!

potential of any human being.
| But it seems that certain elements
|are being wasted at this univer-
|sity. The abilities of certain
minority groups are not given the
opportunity to be developed. It
lis the obligation of this univer-
sity to offer these minority groups
a chance to develop.

And since we believe that fhis
is the democratic way of life, we
| ask the student body, the faculty
}and the administration for their
|support for the following pro-
| posal:

1. In order to live “democracy”
\and not just talk democracy, we
:ask for the establishment of the
| policy which would prohibit the
|existence of those organizations
which exclude persons because
| of racial or religious reasons,

through clauses or by means of
| traditions. We believe it would
|be best for the students within
‘organizations to effect these
\changes themselves. We also
{contend that the administration
should actively urge the initia-
| tion of this proposal.

| With the removal of the prac-
tice of discrimination by fraterni-
{ties and sororities, the social at-
{mosphere at Bucknell: will be
more democratic, and in turn will
| appeal to individuals from minor-
‘ity groups to apply for admission.
But this is not the only barrier
'that must be overcome.

At the present, there is a bill
before the General Assembly of
Pennsylvania at Harrisburg which
states the following: “It is hereby
declared to be the policy of this
commonwealth that all persons
shall have equal opportunities for
education regardless of their race,
religion, color, ancestry, or na-
tional origin.” The bill goes on
to say the following in Section
IV, “It shall be an unfair educa-
tional practice for an educational
institution to make any written

concerning or designed to elicit

We believe that the administra-
tion of Bucknell has a wonderful
opportunity to show that it is an
institution dedicated to the propo-
sition that “all men are created
equal” and to the democratic way
of life. Bucknell has the oppor-
tunity to anticipate the decision |

To say that fraternities should

the sharing of common bonds of

founded. There must be som2

| Dear Editor,

| Rather than get embroiled in
| the heated exchange of letters
dealing with certain discrimina-

| not exist on the Bucknell campus,
I intend to confine ‘myself to a

ation in the fraternities at Buck-
jnell. None of the 13 fraternities
on this campus are any longer

anyone into their group that they
may choose. In some cases, this
action was initiated only after
extreme pressure and coercion
was applied on a national scale;
yet, it is a step in the right direc-
tion. ut this is NOT to say that
there will no longer be any dis-
crimination as to race, religion,
or color by fraternities in the se-
lection of their membership.

To my way’ of thinking (admit-
tedly from the point of view of
an insider in the fraternity sys-
tem), a certain selectivity of
membership is a necessity for the

| tory practices that may or may}

few remarks regarding discrimin- |

restricted or prevented by consti- |
tutional provisions from accepting

lectivity with which I am at vari-
ance.

Not to be hypocritical, I must
admit that my fraternity is sup-
posedly discriminatory; yet, since
the revocation of my fraternity’s
discriminatory clause many years
ago, there has never been a case
in which a person has not been
pledged because of his religion or
race.

My main point is this—even
with the elimination of actual,
specific discriminatory clauses,
there will still be discrimination.
The selection is necessary for the
continuance of the fraternity; dis-
crimination, an outgrowth of se-
lection, is a defense mechanism in
which subjective evaluations are
substituted for objective ones
emotion overrides reason, and
cultural biases suppress ideals.

Regrettably, there is often at
least one person in a closely-knit
group (such as most fraternities)
who does not want to live or have
close association with a Negro,
Jew, Asiatic, or even a white
Christian, regardless of personal-
ity. ~

I advocate the right of selec-
tion. I deplore the existence of
discrimination; yet, where does
one draw the line between the
two? The constitutional barriers
are down; the traditional barriers
still exist, and even if these are
not perpetuated from year to year
by the selective process of each
group, the prejudices and biases
of each individual’s cultural up-
bringing will determine whether
and why a blackball is used.

This seems to be an unavoid-
able impasse—selectivity is essen-
tial, yet it all-too-often leads di-
rectly to discrimination. One can-
not pass a law banning discrim-

mere existence of a fraternity,
and despite all the self-righteous
chatter of the day, the fraternity

“THE SLOW RUSH”

Illustrated below is the membership pin of a brand-new national
fraternity called Signa Phi Nothing. To join Signa Phi Nothing
and get this hideous membership pin absolutely free, simply
take a pair of scissors and cut out the illustration and paste it
to your dickey.

Let me hasten to state that I do not recommend your joining
Signa Phi Nothing. The only thing I recommend in this column
is Marlboro cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes 2
filtered cigarette with an unfiltered taste, who yearns to settle
back and enjoy a full-flavored smoke, whose heart is quickened
by a choice of soft pack or flip-top box and who gets paid every
week for writing this column.

It is difficult to think of any reason why you should join
Signa Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by
nature; if you are one such I must tell you there are any number
of better organizations than Signa Phi Nothing for you to join—
the Mafia, for example.

But if you should join Signa Phi Nothing, let me give
several warnings. First off, it is the only fraternity that admits
girls. Second, there is no pledge period; each new member im-
mediately goes active. Perhaps “inactive” is 2 more accurate
term; there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns, no sports,
no games, no dues, no grip, and no house.

The only thing Signa Phi Nothing has that other fraternities
have is a fraternity hymn. In faet, two hymns were submitted

to a recent meeting of the national board of directors (none of
whom attended). The first hymn goes:

Hotcha, boop-boop-a-doop,
Mother’s making blubber soup.

The second hymn is considerably longer:
A Guernsey's a cow,
A road is a lane,
When, yow’re eating chow,
Remember the mein!

Pending the next meeting of the national board of directors,
which will never be held, members are authorized to sing either
hymn. Or, for that matter, Stardust.

Perhaps you are asking why there should be such a fraternity
as Signa Phi Nothing. I will give you an answer—an answer
with which you cannot: possibly disagree: Signa Phi Nothing
fills a well-needed gap.

Are you suffering from mental health? Is logic distorting
your thinking? Is ambition encroaching on your native sloth?
Are your long-cherished misapprehensions retreating before a
sea of facts? In short, has education caught up with you?

Tf so, congratulations. But tell the truth—wouldn’t you like
to make an occasional visit back to the good old days when you
were not so wise and composed and industrious—when you
were, in fact, nuttier than a fruitcake?

If you pine for those old familiar miasms, those dear, dead
vapors, join Signa Phi Nothing and renew, for a fleeting
moment, your acquaintance with futility. We promise nothing,
and, by George, we deliver it!

How does Bill feel about his job? “Give a man

by Carol Pope

Have that urge to get out and
see the world? Want to combine
study with travel and pleasure?
Then foreign study is the plan for
you. The number. of academic
programs, both summer and win-
ter, open to American college
students now reaches into the
thousands. The opportunities for
foreign study are numberless; it
remains for you to choose—and
choose carefully—the type of
study plan you wish to participate
in.

There are essentially three
categories of foreign study pro-
grams. The first, and perhaps the
best known, of these is the Junior
Year Abroad program. Many
people are discouraged before
starting by the misconception that
proficiency in the native language
of a country is necessary in order
to take part in a Junior Year pro-
gram. On the contrary, there are
many foreign universities which
offer courses in English, as well
as numerous American-sponsored
study tours to various foreign

countries which carry on all their;

activities in English. ‘
Study Tours
To cite an example, a study
tour to the University of Vienna
offers both a full year and a half
year, or a semester program, in
which classes may be taken in

English or German or both ac-|

cording to the overall language
proficiency of the student. In-
cluded in this program are three
field-study tours which cover the
better part of the Western Euro-

pean continent combining travel, |
in one. |

study, and culture all
While attending classes at the
university, you will be living and

mingling with Austrians, an ex- |

perience in international relation-
ships and foreign understanding
invaluable in itself.

Finally, you do not even have
to be a language major in order
to participate in a Junior Year
program. Many European Uni-
versities offer specialized pro-
grams and accept students major-
ing in a number of different fields.
For example,
Birmingham offers speci
courses in drama while Vienna
offers the same to music majors.

Summer Sessions

The second major category of
foreign Study is that of summer
sessions conducted in various uni-
versities throughout Europe. Most

Foreign Study. Programs Offer

jindependent study. Generally, a
jstudent interested in summer
study will enroll in only one or
pes courses, usually including a
| language course, for the sole pur-
|pose of mastering a language or
studying a subject for its own
sake, regardless of obtaining
| transfer of credit.

Few summer sessions offer
| credits for their courses which are
recognized by American Univer-
jsities, contrary to Junior Year
| Plans, but there are a few excep-
‘tions namely the Universities of
| Edinburgh, London, Oxford, and
| Stratford-upon-Avon, four British
| Summer Schools which work un-
| der a joint program. The choice
| of, subjects available for summer
jstudy is wide and inclusive.

For example, the previously
mentioned British schools offer
|courses in Shakespearean and
| and Elizabethan drama, literature,
| politics, and the arts in eighteenth
{eentury English, and literature
| and art from the Augustan to the
romantic period, while the New
|York University which holds a
summer session
‘with Netherland Universities of-
,fers such-courses as the Theory
of Comparative Literature, Seven-
teenth Century European Art, the
European Common. Market, Its
Politics and Economics, and the
Modern European Drama.

Graduate Study

undergraduates may participate in
| these summer sessions.

Special-\

ized study opportunities are avail- |

able in just about every field, if
only you take the initiative to in-
quire into the matter. History,
political science, language, and
sociology majors would benefit

particularly from such foreign |

study. Not only are the courses
themselves extremely advantag-

uate study, numerous scholarships
are available to students, an ad-
ditional benefit which: is not of-
fered at other levels of foreign
study.

Global Understanding

cerning this event presents the
following statement of its deeper
implications: Universal brother-
hood is a concept that may be
partially realized through our
participation in the Burma-Buck-
nell Weekend. We come together
as students with a sincere inter-
‘est in meeting new friends as
well as strengthening old friend-
ships. Gaining mutual under-
standing is the stimulant which
gives this weekend importance to
ieach one of us. Recognition of
}our concern comes with support
|from the Embassy of the Union
‘of Burma, our own Department
| of State, and the Baptist Foreign
Mission Board who help us locete
students and facilitate their at-
| tendance. Financial support
‘comes from the Asia Foundation
and private friends who realize
|the value of this program, and
who know that without certain
expenses our program would be
impossible. Thus we are able
to accept for ourselves the re-
sponsibilities involved in continu-
ing friendly relations between the
people of Burma and the people
of the United States.
‘that our aspirations toward the
brotherhood of man are better
realized within these few days.
| We hope this will be a grand
weekend filled with the warmth
, that comes with friendship.”

New Generation

By Taylor in
by Bruce Bonta .

Harold Taylor, former president ,
of Sarah Lawrence College and.
a speaker at the recent Religion-—
in-Life program here, has written
an article (The New Young Are
Heard) in the New York Times
magazine of January 29, in which
he stated: “In America at the be-
ginning of the Nineteen Sixties, a
new generation has appeared.”

The article is divided into
thee parts, the first of which dis-
cusses the characteristics of the
college age generation of the
Eisenhower administration and
by the negativistic attitudes of
their elders, did not openly com-
ment on public affairs but rather
turned quietly to jazz and folk)
music, philosophy and liberal
writings.

In the second and most sub-
stantial of the three parts, the
new generation of the 1960's is!
discussed. Athough the author
mentions no casual reason for what
he maintains is a changing atti- |
tude of the’ younger generation, |
a movement toward outspoken
criticism and progressive actions
by the college students of today, |
he does attribute an increase in}
youth activities to the new U. S.)
president— a remarkable obser- |
vation, since the article was pub-
lished nine days after the inaug-
uration. In the major section of
the second part of the article, the |
author cites a number of ex-|
amples from various American |
universities to show that the|
movement he is writing about!
does exist.

In the concluding paragraphs,
Dr. Taylor tries to clarify some/
vague conceptions which the}
reader has struggled to under-!
stand throughout the article. He;
makes clear at the end that the |
whole discussion on the inde-
pendently thinking, speaking, and |
acting college generation con-|
cerns only a minority of the stu- |
dents.

over from an old one; the reader
must conclude that these terms
refer to the small, active minor-

some connections with other col-

Taylor’s views through compari-

bedroom which had about it a
quality of thereness — nothing

of color, was comparable to that

the overwhelming enthusiasm of
the M. I. T. students for such pro-

graduate technicians to Nigeria is
really an exceptional rather than
a normal situation. After all, here
at Bucknell isn’t the CA pleading

Joey the Heel
Wins All Hearts

When Pal Joey, the Broadway
and Hollywood production by
Rodgers and Hart, was first pre-
sented in 1940, half of the audi-
ence applauded wildly and the
other half sat in stony silence.
Rodgers and Hart had done the
impossible: they had created a
leading man who was a heel, a
ead, and a louse, but still they
had endowed him with an appeal
that made men sympathize with
him and women wish that he
would try to seduce them.

University Players, under the
direction of Michael Gavin, will
present Pal Joey on March 17, 1
23, and 24 in the University
Theatre. Jeff Gaynor, as Joey,
sings, dances, and woos his way
from a little night club in the wali
to his own, Chez Joey. Along his
pathway he meets Linda Garrett
as the “bewitched, bothered, and
bewildered” Vera, who is out for
all she can get and gets it. And
in a nightclub he finds Linda,
played by Susan Aymar, who
“Could Write a Book” if asked,
and Gladys, a “Red Hot Mamma,”
played by Judith Levy, who has
plenty of “Zip”.

Tickets will be available at the
Bookstore and the Pitch Pipee be-
ginning March 9.

A Clarificati

Much has been said about discrimination on the Buck-
nell campus, both on the printed page and in heated and
some not-so-heated discussions.. In view of the recent ex-
change of letters-to-the editor, the Bucknellian wishes to
clarify its stand on discrimination.

We originally raised the issue in order to obtain some
concrete proof for the charge that the admissions staff
discriminates in their selection of students. We are happy
to recognize, as a result of figures released last week, that
this charge is completely unfounded.

Moreover, a check of scholarship records shows that the

Betty Ann Quinn scholarship mentioned in last week's
editorial has been awarded to a Negro student every se-
mester for the past five years. At present, it is not being
used because its recipient withdrew at the end of the first
semester. ;

In addition, a check of applications shows that Irwin
Roberson, the star athlete described in last week’s edi-
torial, did not apply to Bucknell. It is thought that he
was interested in this school and may have been ap-
proached by the athletic department, but no facts are
available to corroborate this rumor.

A clarification of these statements by no means closes
the issue; if anything, it should make us more aware of
the problems at stake. As we see it, the question of dis-
crimination is two-fold. (1) To encourage more Negroes
to apply to Bucknell, two steps may be taken: the picture
now requested on the application could be eliminated, and
pictures requested only after the applicant has applied
for admission. Secondly, the admissions team might make
more of an effort to seek out qualified Negroes in their in-
terviewing. .

(2) To make the social climate amenable to Negroes,
students must evidence a desire for real understanding of
and friendship with those of other races. Paul Pearson’s
letter indicated that none of the fraternities on this cam-
pus have discriminatory clauses. This reassurance re-
lieves us from making a token gesture to remove such
clauses. The question is not one of clauses, but one of
attitude. We would hope that the individuals comprising
each fraternal organization reserve the right to choose
members on the basis of personal qualities, and that each
chapter, in turn, is free to extend membership accord-
ingly.

But why, you ask, should we bother to diversify the
student population? There is an answer to this question:
it is unrealistic and provincial for a university to exist as
an island in the midst of the racial problems confronting
the rest of the United States. To discourage contact with
other races and nationalities is to shelter today’s student
and to submerge him in a stagnant environment.

By the educative process, woven of both social and aca-
demic threads, we expect individuals to learn to recognize
other human beings for their abilities and attributes, re-
gardless of their racial or socio-economic heritages.
is the Bucknell community ready to accept this respon-
sibility?

Salute to Challenge

Miss Marsha O’Bannon and those who assisted her in
making the “America Challenged” program possible de-
serve the congratulations of all Bucknellians for sponsor-
ing one of the most emphatically successful programs of
its kind in recent years. The topic was as timely and fit-
ting a one as could Have been chosen: America Challenged
in a Changing World. It was general enough to be inter-
esting and important to any citizen, but specific enough to
be highly informative and to provide the factual basis for
responsible opinion making. It covered domestic as well
as international issues.

The personnel who came to lead the sessions were es-
pecially noteworthy, if a little weak on the conservative
side. It is to Miss O’Bannon’s credit that she was able to
secure such prominent personages.

The success of the conference lies not only in that im-
portant men discussed current issues at Bucknell, but also
in that the student response was so great. Each session
was crowded with people, who asked pertinent and intel-
ligent questions which teflected interest in, as well as
awareness of, the problems involved

With the hope that students will continue to think and
discuss the “challenging” ideas presented by this two-day
conference, the Bucknellian salutes both Bucknell and the
Challenge.

Pre-Counseling for Frosh ("e<'

by Richard Goldman

Recently the administration of this university under-
took a program designed to raise the academic standards
of Bucknell. The quality of both courses and professors
has improved considerably. I think most students will
acknowledge the successful efforts by the administration
to make Bucknell worthy of calling itself an “institution
of higher learning.” I feel, however, that the administra-
tion has overlooked one very important fact.

Incoming freshmen are not aware of this academic re-
form program; and, under the present system, the only
way they can find out is to go through the rigors of their
first semester. Unfortunately, some freshmen experience
more difficulty than others because they sign up for the
wrong courses, plan an unbalanced schedule, or take too
many courses in one semester that involve extensive read-
ing or writing.

Actually, the difficulty these people experience is unnec-
essary. The situation can be remedied if the administra-
tion, along with its other reforms, will provide counseling
for freshmen before they sign up for courses and before
they arrive on campus in September. Right now the only
“counselor” available to a high school senior, who has
been accepted by Bucknell, is the catalogue. An incom-
ing freshman must select his first semester courses, mak-
ing his decisions solely on what he learns from the cata-
logue. . For instance, History 99 and 100: “The evolution
of Western Civilization from its beginning to the present
time, with emphasis on problems and values.” This is
what it says in the catalogue; sounds pretty innocuous,
doesn’t it? There is nothing to keep a freshman from
taking courses like History 99, Religion 100, Math. 201, a
third year language, and English 101 all in the first se-
mester.

Counseling is definitely needed, as evidenced by the
fact that too many freshmen took a first semester as heavy
as the one just outlined, too heavy to hapdle efficiently,
and they are now in serious academic difficulty. Some

were forced to do only half a job on one or two subjects .

in hopes that the extra time could be used to pull up two
other subjects. Too many freshmen have a “2.000” as
their goal rather than striving for a higher average. This
is.a poor situation to be forced into anda poor attitude
to take toward learning.

The administration should require incoming freshmen
to come up to Bucknell before the end of July to go over
their first semester schedule with their counselor. The
counselor should make changes to make sure that the new
student takes the best courses and spreads them out so he
has the time to get the most from his courses. I realize
that in some cases a freshman will find it impossible to
arrange a trip to Bucknell for this purpose, but institu-
tions such as Penn State are able to operate a counseling
system similar to this one, and I see no reason why Buck-
nell should be behind in this area.

My suggestions will not help the people who are too
lazy to keep up their marks; but if a counseling service is
established more hard-working and deserving students
will be left at Bucknell to benefit from the newly improv-
ed academic standards. ;

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor, A

With concern over the recent
editorial approach to the first se-
mester operation of women’s co-
operative self-government, Senate
would like to present some com-
ments on the questions which you
raised. As a representative body,
we have felt the need to be aware
throughout the past semester of
the problems which are in estab-
lishing a new mechanism of self-
government.

However, we have come to be-
lieve, in the past months,. that
women are beginning to under-}
stand their new government as a}
practical system affording them
the opportunity to make their liv-
ing situation one of individual
freedom within the boundaries of |
standard regulations based upon
cooperation with and concern for
others. The role of residence
councils, a completely new con-
cept on this campus, is gradually
becoming clearer both to the
women students and to the coun-
cils themselves, who have, when-
ever necessary used the open
communication with the Judicial
Board and found it helpful.

As was explained to the women}
students in the fall, the Commit-
tee for the Revision of the Con-
stitution has served to bring to
Senate, to House, and to all the
women students through Senate’s
widely distributed biweekly min-
utes comprehensive discussion of
all the comments and suggestions
for possible changes made on the
ballots by which the women
adopted our new government last
spring. These discussions are the
basis from which proposed |
change will be incorporated in
the Constitution presented to the
women for ratification in the

As this evaluation is a continu-
ous process both in Senate and
in the minds of every woman stu-
dent, it is our hope that the}
women will continue to communi-
cate their ideas and suggestions
to their representative bodies so
that our work can most effective- !
ly serve their interests.

Thank you. |

Members of Senate of WSGA
Dear Editor, |

In Dean Hartzell’s explanation |
of the decision to eliminate the}
compulsory nature of Military |
was a
careful avoidance of a matter of |
more than passing concern to sev-
eral hundred students here. These
students are the men of the pres- |
ent freshman class, and that mat- |
ter is their having to take ROTC!
next year. i

In making their decision last}
June, the Trustees of the Univer-
sity were, in effect, recognizing |
the fact that the basic ROTC
course is useless, time-wasting, |
and generally undesirable for a}
great number of students who do
not plan to continue with the pro- |
gram. There are those (mostly |
ROTC instructors) who will argue!
that participation in the program
gives an individual “leadership,”
“discipline,” and other equally in-
tangible benefits.

But at what cost are these
benefits received, if they are re-
ceived at all? They are received
at the expense of six to ten hours
a week out of the student's valu-
able time—time which could be
and should be devoted to academ-
ic subjects. We are not paying
over $2000 a year to be disciplin-
ed; we are paying to obtain an
education.

This academic year compulsory
ROTC was eliminated from Rut-
gers and Cornell. At both of
these great institutions the pres- |
ent sophomores, who last year;
started under the compulsory
program, were not required to
take ROTC this year. Why can’t
Bucknell follow the same logical
example?

Sincerely, t
Charles Furst

Dear Editor:

I would like to take this op-
portunity to express to those who
were connected with the prepara-
tion for this past weekend’s
CHALLENGE program my con-
gratulations for a job well done.

and very informative. Although

education can be had from books,

I feel that one may learn just as
much from hearing discussions |
upon those subjects about which
one learns in books. I felt that
the CHALLENGE program pro-
vided such an opportunity to hear |
and learn from sources apart from;
books. I woud hope that in the
near future we would have an-
other such program.

One of the interesting features |
of this program whtich also added
to the enjoyment and maintain

the fact that the speakers were |

lish a uniform cut system. An-
other topic that is currently under
discussion in the Congress is that
of the reorganization of the entire |
system of student government. '
The proposed plan, which is un-|
der study, would reconstruct our |

| government to resemble that of|

the Federal Government with the}
three branches under central con- |
trol. A problem which will be}
open for discussion for the first |
time at the next meeting is that of |
a student’s privilege to drive and |
park automobiles on campus. |

Along with the things that we
have just mentioned, we are con-|
tinually faced with small but im-
portant jobs. Many of them may |
appear trivial, but they must be,
done. Included in these are reg- |
ulating the Who’s Who election, |
class elections, the Homecoming |
Queen election, investigating and |
recognizing organizations that}
wish to exist on campus, appoint- |
ing of an Artist Series Committee ;
and many others. |

We have tried to give you some |
idea as to how the Student-Fac-|}
utly Congress has been spending |
its time this year. This is not a}
complete list, but we think it}
will serve to give the Bucknell
students some idea as to the func-
tions of their student government.

by Joel Sekeres
Teaching-machines have made!
their debut on the Bucknell cam-
pus. On contract with the United |
States Air Force to test the ef-
fectiveness of the machines, the}
Department of Psychology has!
selected 200 students from intro-,
ductory psychology courses to}
participate in an experiment.
Basically, there are two types
of machines. One machine is de- |
signed to give the correct answers |
to a list of multiple choice ques
tions. For each question there is|
a selection of three buttons cor- |

subject pushes the button of the
correct answer, a bulb lights. |
The other type of machine is |
designed to present and answer |
essay, or open-ended questions. |
The question is presented on one
side of a piece of paper under a
glass panel, and the subject writes |
his answer to the question on the}
other side of the paper. Then, a
lever is pulled which presents the
correct answer, thus enabling the
student to confirm his response.
Advantages
“The teaching-machine has cer-
tain advantages. In any academ-
ie course, certain elementary
terms and concepts must be learn-
ed by rote. The machine would
help a student to know immedi-

ately a he is right or
wrong in defining these terms and
concepts. In addition, the teach-
ing-machine enables a professor
to devote the time he would nor-
mally use in defining elementary
terms and concepts, to class dis-
cussion of a more advanced type.
Conceivably, the machine could

| be used in lieu of text books be-

cause it provides illustrations that
correspond to the terms and con-

\cepts it defines.

However, this innovation has
ts drawbacks. It is a very ex-
pensive item to produce and has
yet to be perfected. Consequent-
ly, a great deal of time and
trouble is involved in setting up
the machine to list all the neces-
sary terms and concepts and to
define them.

At present, the two basic types
of machines are in their experi-
mental stage and are being used
largely for research. It is the

purpose of the Psychology depart- |

ment to determine the types of
questions and the kinds of teach-
ing-machines from which the stu-
dent will learn the most. Al-
though they have been success-
fully used in elementary schools
for learning spelling, mathematics
and general science, there are no
plans yet to use these machines
extensively at Bucknell until
more research is done.

US NATIONAL STUDENT ASSOCIATION

In order to meet the ever in-|
creasing number of requests for |
more “specialized” student travel
programs, the U. S. National Stu-

eral Special Interest Travel Pro-
grams for the 1961 season. Priced |
to meet the limitations of the stu- |
dent budget, these programs focus
on both events and geographical
areas. ;

Included in these special pro-
grams for 1961 are the East-West
tours, Israel tours, Continental
Circle tours, Drive-It-Yourself
tours and the Festivals of Music

ates on April 1, 1961. In past
years winners have come from all
parts of both countries and from
large universities as well as small
colleges. The contestants may
enter either a report on a research
project conducted by themselves
or an essay on the subject, The
role of colloid and surface chem-
istry in some aspect of petroleum
technology. The best essay and
the best report will each receive
prizes of $500 and the second best
$200 each under contest regula-

Meyer and Edward R. Murrow.

Most of those interviewed felt
there was more personal dis-
honesty and more tolerance of it
than in previous generations. Ad-
vertising executive, Fairfax Cone
and Anthropologist Margaret
Mead expressed opinions that to-
day’s personal dishonesty was as-
sociated with Prohibition. Mrs.
Agnes Meyer and Senator Mar-
garet Chase Smith related, it to
World War I 8

Feel Cheated

The idea that some people tend
to cheat when they feel cheated
was expressed frequently. Those
interviewed said that while cheat-
ing occurred against large imper-
sonal institutions such as govern-
ment, insurance companies, cor-
porations, schools, large depart-
ment or chain stores, honesty be-
tweeh individuals was as strong
as ever. .

Almost everyone interviewed,
the article reports, pointed to the
inequities in the income-tax law
and several mentioned the Social
Security regulations which pen-
alizes people for working after
they are 65.

Judge Learned Hand, alone,
stressed an increase in certain
kinds of morality pointing to im-
provements in execution laws,
political graft, voting frauds and
improved standards of judicial
eonduct, although he ‘felt that
“we seem also to have lost most
of our former sense of personal
responsibility.”

In discussing religion in con-
nection with morality, Dr. Rein-
hold Niebuhr asserted that “re-
ligion is much more popular but

meaningful in America to-
day.” He felt there has been a
gradual loss of spirit in the re-
Yigious community, stressing that
the church had become more a
social than a religious institution

n recent years,

Security Need

The preoccupation with security
was a predominant factor in the
comments of Edward R. Murrow
who said that “when a desire for

complete security becomes a ma-,

jor goal, it is little more than a
desire tq return to the warmth
and comfort of protected child-!
hood.”

In summing up the solutions to
the question of morality, there
was a general agreement that dis-
cipline must be strengthened.

Equal stress by many of those
interviewed was on removing the!
inequities from necessary laws}
and rules such as unfair income-

tax laws, inequitable earning re- | Piano for 13 years under the guid-|New Jersey seashore resorts of

objective tests that ignore indi- |
vidual differences, draft regula- |
tions that discriminate, unequal}

Want Leadership

“The American people have
lacked leadership in all these
areas,” Mrs. Agnes Meyer said.
“We need the new values and
goals that can only be defined by
strong, vigorous and _ intelligent
national leadership. Instead of
pursuing individual goals of
wealth and security, we need
have our horizons broadened until
we can see the far greater im-
portance of freedom and coopera-
tion. Our public leaders must
begin using all available scientific
knowledge about the modern
world and its problems to arrive
at an understanding of our proper
national goals and then they must
begin to talk clearly and honestly
to the American people about
them.”

; should be looked on as irrelevant
jin the selection of students and
faculty. Diversity of religious
}views and national and racial
| backgrounds is to be weleomed—
|indeed, should be considered es-
| sential—in an institution of high-
|er learning whose aim is to seek
\the truth wherever it may be
found.”
| C. “Finally, we hold that the
University should be directly con-
cerned both to prevent discrimin-
ation on the basis of race, religion,
or national origin from entering
any part of its life and to protect
its students, its faculty, its staff,
; and its guests from discrimination
while they are associated with the
| University.” s

the t debaters, his ideas were
visionary and often abstr
Relying toe frequently on statist-
ics and scholarly articles, Kirk
failed to defend soundly the con-
8 ive position, which suffered
fr of ver vigor.
On the cther hand, Harrington’s
brand of socialism seemed usually
} 2ppealing in its garb of dynamic
| speech.
|

Harrington suggested finally }
that we must go beyond the wel-.
fare state, that “we must break
through the cant about individual
initiative and find out how demo-
eratically and unbureaucratically
we can bring it into being.” “We
need a new principle of human
beings and self determination,”
pleaded Harrington. “We must
establish a democratic society in
which people determine their own |
destiny.” uy

Plea For Balance

Taking the opposing side, Dr.
Russell Kirk stated that it is
simple to attack the established
order, but more difficult to offer
a sufficient remedy. In a delivery
which seemed pallid beside the
vitality of his opponet, Kirk sug-
gested that Harrington’s form of
government was based on a lib-}
eral error of the nineteenth cen-
tury: that man is sufficient unto
himself and that enlightened self-
mterest is enough. Today, we
recognize this as a fallacy. "

In a controlled tone, Kirk asked } é
for balance. “The state has neg- | 3
lected its obligation to society,”
admitted the conservative, “but |
should We go to the extent of} 5
making the state a kind of social |}
life and death?” :

Viewing a socialist state as pa-|
ternalistic, one which will give all:
things to all men, Kirk claimed |
that it will “deprive man of his}
manhood” and will “keep people
as puppetal children.” ‘

Kirk refused to consider the
problem of poverty in America
seriously. The “pockets of pov-:
erty” now existing are “far dif-
ferent from the grave social ills
in Jess affluent societies,” he said.
The problem of America is, in-
stead, one of prosperity. “Pover-
ty, by the viewpoint of Christian- |
ity, is a blessed state.” Our prob- |
lems are those of the spirit, of |
boredom; these cannot possiby be |
solved by the central state.

Kirk named only two channels |
open to the welfare state: That}
described in Orwell’s 1984 which |
is one of togetherness, in which
everything belongs to .everyone
else; or that of Huxley’s Brave
New World, in which the corrupt-
ing vice of power destroys the
arts and individuality.

New Institutions

In a five-minute rebuttal, Har-
rington quoted statistics from the
Bureau of Labor proving that 41
million are hungry. He next an-j
swered Kirk’s challenge about the
channels open to the welfare} banquet

Disarmament or Death were
the alternatives described by Dr.
Norman Thomas during the Chal-
lenge program Fri. morning. Ad-
dressing an audience which com-
pletely filled Vaughan Literature
Auditorium, he argued emphatic-
ally and convincingly for univer-
sal, controlled disarmament down
to the police level.

Thomas stated that the nature
of modern weapons and the mass
annihilation of human life and
civilization which would result
from their use make disarmament
the only sane course to follow.
At present, he declared, there are
“stockpiles containing the equiva-
lent of ten tons of TNT for each
inhabitant of the world.” Term-
ing the existing situation a “‘bal-
ance of terror,” he described the
ease with which this balance
could be upset and predicted that
if present conditions continue,
such an upset is inevitable.

Disarmament Not Enough

Realistically, Thomas admitted
that disarmament, even if success-
ful, would not guarantee world
peace, and that other steps would
be necessary. He stressed the
strengthen, the United
which, in spite of its
many imperfections, represents
the only step yet made toward
world cooperation. With respect

|involving the risk of war.”

Discussing necessary economic
!measures, Thomas deplored the
“war economy” of our present
|“garrisoned state,” in which al-
{most half of the funds available
| for scientific research are channel-
;ed into weapon development, and
pleaded for a planned transition
to a “peace economy.” In the
social sphere, he raised the prob-
lem of discrimination, emphasiz-
ing the immeasurable damage
done to our foreign prestige by
such’ incidents as race riots.

Thomas’ treatment of the tradi-
‘tional objections raised to disarm-
ament again struck an impres-
sively realistic note. He express-
ed hope that a new Geneva Con-
ference, unmarred by a U2 inci-
dent, might produce a satisfactory
treaty, for Russia is more confi-
dent than America of winning the
cold war without arms. In addi-
tion, however, he emphasized the
fact that secret testing might be
continued by Russia, and that in
all probability no system of in-
spection adequate to detect such
tests would be possible.

Taking this fact into considera-
tion, he nevertheless declared that
the risk of total annihilation im-
plied by continued armament is
infinitely greater than the risk of
increased Russian power which
might result from a policy of dis-
armament. Americans have
ceased to value universal ideals
and are concerned only with na-
tional security, with the preserva-
tion of their own way of life. But
it is unrealistic to refuse to face
the fact that this way of life
would be more irrevocably des-
troyed by mass annihilation than
by any form of Russian domina-

Concepts of ‘Our Greatest Challenge

by Bruce Bonta
President Kennedy’s statement
that “Our greatest challenge is
that world that lies beyond the
eold war” provided the point of
departure for comments and argu-
ments in the Friday evening panel
debate of the Challenge program.
John Zeller was the moderator of
the panel which consisted of so- :
qialists Michael Harrington and,
Norman Thomas; Russell Kirk, a}
. noted conservative; and E. M. De-|
brah, a Ghanese diplomat.
Michael Harrington keynote:
his conception of our future world
by questioning whether taaaant
nature could be changed in order}
that man would be able to live in
a peaceful, unaggressive society.
He said that during the last war
Americans were both friendly to- |
ward strangers and patriotic to}
their country, but he wondered if}
people would get along with each |
other so well in the hoped for fu- |
ture society, or if there would be}
a “patriotism of peace:’ The na-}
tion will probably be unified, but, |
he asked, “Will freedom survive
in such a_world?”

When questioned as to how the
world beyond the welfare state
would be arrived at, he said that
a political realignment would first
be necessary. A mass movement

zouped around John Zeller, vice-president of the university and

moderator of the Friiday night panel on ‘Our Greatest Challenge: ; sa

x by Joel Sekeres

Dr. Norman Thomas, a candi-
jate for the Presidency of the
United States six times on the
Socialist Party ticket, held a news
conference at the S. A. M. Fra-
ternity House today. Paul Pear-
son introduced the distinguished
gentleman to a receptive audience
of 85 students and news reporters.

The purpose of the conference
was to allow members of the press
and the student body to question
Mr. Thomas on various news
events of national and interna-
tional importance.

Cuban Revolution Discussed

Mr. Thomas maintained some
very definite opinions concerning
the Cuban revolution. He said
that as a social revolution “it has
brushed out some evil things, but
also has denied many civil liber-
ties.’ He did not think that the
revolution was inspired by Com-
munists, but agreed that Russian

| Americanism” existing there to-
| day.

| When asked to comment on this
jcurrent anti-Americanism in
|Cuba, Mr. Thomas replied that
| previous support of Batista for
economic purposes by American
industrialists set in motion “a
chain of errors.” “The revolution
could have been avoided if we

| been accused of exploiting cer-
tain Latin American countries,
Mr. Thomas feels that the “worst
exploitation of these countries is
by their own people, not by the
United States. High taxes are
creating an almost impossible
burden for the poor people of
Latin America and land reforms
are an immediate necessity. The
prominent speaker praised the
Kennedy administration which
has embarked on a training pro-
|gram for potential leaders of the
Latin American countries; leaders
who may once again uphold de-
mocracy. He emphasized a “posi-
tive approach” to the Latin
| American situation as the only
| procedure to stifle Russia Com-
munist influence there.

The speaker was asked to com-
ment on the U-2 spy incident and
the subsequent loss of world pres-
tige by the United States. He
thought that Eisenhower should
not have taken full responsibility
for the incident, because, accord-
ing to informed sources, Eisen-
hower had no knowledge of that
particular flight. | However, the
Republican administration feared
that the Democrats would accuse
Eisenhower “of failing to know
what was going on in his admin-
istration,” and advised Eisen-
hower to take the blame.

cold war must be kept out. Africa
should not meet the difficulty it
now faces in accepting aid from

that there was nothing immoral
about accepting desperately need-

two nations. Castro, represent-
ing a neutral nation, was under
no obligation to restrict Cuban
trade with Russia.

According to Mr. Thomas, after
the United States drastically re-
duced the Cuban sugar quota, and
jeventually cut it off completely,

Castro had no alternative but to;

seek aid from the willing Russian
Communists. At present, the
United States is resorting to the
Monroe Doctrine as an argument
o keep Russian influence out of
this hemisphere. However, Mr.
Thomas believes that “since we
intervened in Europe during the
two world wars, we should not
expect other nations to refrain
from interfering in the problems
of this hemisphere.” In _ other
words, the Monroe Doctrine is a
| “dead principle” in this matter.
} Latin America Viewed
There is widespread fear that
the influence of the Cuban revo-
lution will spread to other un-
stable Latin American countries.
Athough the United ‘States has

effect in April, will call for 60% |

for the public sector.

If India had as much time as
the Western nations in which to
develop, commented Stracey, we
might be able to rely more upon
private investment. India, how-
ever,-wants to develop quickly,

'and the most expedient means to

rapid development is a partially
socialized economy.
Foreign Aid

One aim of the third five-year
plan is to encourage more private
investment. The chief aim is to
ehd excessive dependence on
foreign aid and imports. Para-
doxically enough, the success of
this plan will depend on foreign
capital, much of which will come
from the USA.

Ina quéstion and answer period
following the speech, Stracey
stated that India expects to re-
ceive $2 billion from the United
States in the next five years.
Other aid will come from Eng-
land, West Germany, Russia, and
the Colombo nations.

India’s aim is to achieve an
economy in the middle of the
road between racial socialism and
capitalism. For the present, the
public sector must lead in the de-
velopment of India’s economy.

ment of the “arms problem”
would be to ban nuclear tests
permanently.
Discrimination Criticized

Dr. Thomas concluded his in
jterview by voicing his opinions
on a prevalent topic of discussion
at Bucknell: discrimination ‘in
college. “It is ‘inexcusable for
any college to uphold any policy
jof discrimination based on color
jor creed.” He advocated selec-

students should be coddled by
having lower academic require-
ments, he believes that colleges

Challenge Plans
More Seminars

A two-day challenge was
enough to set the campus think-
ing, according to Marsha O’Ban-
non, chairman of the 1961 CHAL-
LENGE program. But the issues
are far from dead with the end of
the conference.

The officers of the Challenge
are initiating a number of stu-
dent-faculty koffee-klatches to be
held in faculty homes, as well as
in fraternity and university liv-
ing rooms.

Some of the discussions will be

formally organized, while others
will serve as opportunities for in-
formal conversation on national
and international issues. It is
hoped that both types of seminars
will contribute to bettering stu-
dent-faculty relations, as well as
engender creative thought about
world probiems.
: Those interested in participat-
ing in the program are urged to
contact Marsha O’Bannon in the
‘Owens House.

Eligible students who intend to}
take this test should apply at once |
to the nearest Selective Service |
local board for an application and
a bulletin of information.

Following instructions in the|
bulletin, the student should fill|
out his application and mail it
immediately in the envelope pro-
vided to Selective Service Exam- |

ing Service, P. O. Box 586, Prince-
ton, New Jersey. Applications }
for the April 27 test must be post- |
marked no later than midnight, |

According to Educational Test- |
ing Service, which prepares and
administers the College Qualifica-
tion Test for the Selective Service \
System, it will be greatly to the;
student’s advantage to file his ap-j
plication at once. Test results |
will be reported to the student’s

NORTHERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

Dr. Mandrill Gibbon, head of the department of zoology at
Northern Reserve University, and known to young and old for
his work on primates, announced yesterday that he had re-
ceived a grant of $80,000,000 for a twelve-year study to deter-
mine precisely how much fun there is in a barrel of monkeys.

Whatever the results of Dr. Gibbon’s researches, this much
is already known: What’s more fun than a barrel of monkeys is

a pack of Marlboro. There is zest and cheer in every puff,
delight in every draw, content and well-being in every fl
flavorful cloudlet. And what’s more, this merriest of cigarettes
comes to you both in soft pack and flip-top box wherever cig-
arettes are sold at prices that do no violence to the slimmest of
purses. So why don’t you settle back soon and enjoy Marlboro,
the filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste

EASTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY
The annual meeting of the American Philological Institute,
held last week at Eastern Reserve University, was enlivened
by the reading of two divergent monographs concerning the
origins of early Gothic “runes,” as letters of primitive alphabets
are called.

Dr. Tristram Lathrop Spleen, famed far and wide as the dis-
coverer of the High German Consonant Shift, read a paper in
which he traced the origins of the Old Wen rune ‘‘pt””
(pronounced “‘krahtz’”) to the middle Lettic rune “or” (pro-
nounced ‘“albert’”’). On the other hand, Dr. Richard Cummer-
bund Twonkey, who, as the whole world knows, translated
“The Pajama Game” into Middle High Bactrian, contended
in his paper that the Old Wendish rune “pt’’ derives from the
Low Erse rune “mf” (pronounced “‘gr’’).

Well, sir the discussion grew so heated that Dr. Twonkey
finally asked Dr. Spleen if he would like to step into the gym-
nasium and put on the gloves. Dr. Spleen accepted the chal-
lenge promptly, but the contest was never held because there
were no gloves in the gymnasium that would fit Dr. Twonkey.

(The reader is doubtless finding this hard to believe as
Eastern Reserve University is celebrated the length and breadth
of the land for the size of its glove collection. However, the
reader is asked to remember that Dr. Twonkey has extraor-
dinarily small hands and arms. In fact, he spent the last
war working in a small-arms plant, where he received two
Navy “E” Awards and was widely hailed as a “manly little
chap.”)

“Until I got on the inside,’ he
said, “I thought they had us lick- |
ed over here because of wage
rates. I know differently now.
For every penny they’re saving in
direct labor costs, they’ve got us;
whipped by three cents in gen-/|
eral overhead. Inside the plant, |
it’s about a standoff—but when!
you get to the office, they make!
us look like fools.”

His company and this European |
firm are about the same size in}
terms of units of production. The |
American company has about |
1200 hourly workers in its plant.
the overseas factory 1300. But)
in terms of salaried employes, it's |
a different story—912 in America|
versus 221 in Europe. There’s aj
clue to our basic disadvantage in |
foreign competition today. Here;
in the United States we have the|
most expensive industrial man-
agement on earth.

It starts right at the top. The
American firm mentioned has an
active chairman of the board, a
president, five vice presidents, and |
an executive staff of 42 people.
The European firm is run by a|
managing director and one key|
assistant. The top-management '
staff totals only nine. The con-|
trast continues right down the!
line. “They could pay our wage |
rates,” the American president |
said, “and we still couldn’t com-
pete—our overhead would lick us|
hands down.”

“If you know the answer, why |
don’t you go home with a big ax}
and chop yourelf down to size?”
I asked. His reply pretty well}
defined the problem: “How can
I? Even if I were capable of
running our company as a one-
man show—which is virtually}
what's happening over here—I’m}
not at all certain that I could get
away with it as far as our organi-|
zation is concerned. Our second- |
level executives haven’t been}
trained to take over in the way
these European boys have.” Fin-
ally, almost to himself, he added, |
“I wonder how we got so far off |
the beam?”

One Explanation

I have a theory that may be at |
least partially applicable. This |
man, like so many other corpora- |
tion heads today, is now in his
middle 50’s. That means he spent!
his formative years during the
Depression. as I did, when busi-
ness leaders were being violently |
attacked as enemies of society—:
greedy, grasping, dictatorial, anti-
social. Not all these politically |
inspired charges were true by any
means, but the rising young busi- |
nessman of that day saw enough |
truth in some of them to cause |
him to decide that when he got}
to the top, he was going to be};
different. Before long, we found |

When Gene Segin got his B.S. in Business Ad-
ministration at the University of Illinois, he was
in touch with 8 prospective employers.

Gene joined Illinois Bell Telephone Company
because: ‘“The people I talked to here made it
very clear that I would not be shuffled into some
narrow specialized job. | thought this job offered
the greatest opportunity for broad experience.”

On his first assignment Gene was sent to Spring-
field where he conducted courses in human rela-
tions for management people.

His next move was to a traffic operations job
in Rock Island. On this assignment he was in
charge of all personnel who are directly responsible
for handling telephone calls in this heavily popu-
lated area. Here Gene earned a reputation for
sound judgment and skill in working with people.
He was promoted to Traffic Supervisor.

“| DON’T THINK THERE’S ANY END
TO THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUSINESS”

Today, Gene’s chief responsibilities are in man-
agement training and development, and company-
union relations. The latter includes contract bar-
gaining and helping settle labor disputes.

How does Gene feel about his job? “It’s a real
challenge. I’m in some of the most vital and in-
teresting work in the country.” And about the
future—‘“Well there aren’t any pushover jobs
around here. It’s tough. But if a man has what it
takes, I don’t think there’s any end to the oppor-
tunity in this business.”

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

Wake Up!

We are gratified by the intelligent student response to
the pane discussion sponsored by Phi Lambda Theta last
week. It is our belief that'free and open discussion is the
most expedient means to the airing and solution of ques-
tions and problems, We have shared in a discussion,
which was more than a mass of sound and fury; now, it
is time for action.

We heartily commend the faculty for their stand on the
discrimination issue. An ‘extension of the charter of
Bucknell University, the faculty has stated that religious
beliefs, national, and racial origins should be looked on as
irrelevant in the selection of students and faculty; that it
recommends that no application blank contain a request
for a photograph or for the religious affiliation of the ap-
plicant; and that it approves the intent of the Fair Educa-
tional Practice bills now before the state legislature. ,

The faculty has shown its position; what of the stu-
dents? In the previously mentioned debate, it was right-
ly stated that the bulk of the responsibility for diversify-

ing the student body rests upon the students themselves. , |

‘Various means to this end are now wihin the realm of
possibility.

A study undertaken by a member of the English de-
partment has shown that more applicants hear about
Bucknell from other students, than from any other source.
What better means exists, of changing the “image” of
Bucknell, than by our informing students of other racial
and economic groups of the educational opportunities
available here? As students, we can encourage the filing
of applications for admissions by qualified students from
our own high schools and communities. We can do more
ourselves toward securing such applications, than can the
Admissions Office.

Secondly, we all realize that a major reason for the ab-
sence of qualified students from lower economic groups
results from a lack of substantial scholarships. Why not
accumulate funds for a scholarship fund to be awarded to
a selected student: from another racial and/or economic
group? This fund would be maintained by student con-
tributions and administered by the university. Incident-
ally, a contribution to such a scholarship fund would
make an excellent class gift!

Discussion has resulted in the realization that all seg-
ments of the Bucknell community desire a more diversi-
fied student body. We have stated several means by

which we, as students, may further the realization of this
Now, let us act!

Thode, Bat <=.

goal.

The Bucknellian is pleased to have received the letter
from the Student-Faculty Congress executive committee
printed in last week’s issue. We had first hoped to receive
such a letter after the appearance of an editorial in mid-
December ending with the question, “SFC, what are you
doing?” SFC’s letter was well-expressed, tactful and in-
formative, if somewhat late.

We feel, however, that some of the criticisms which
mentioned in the letter bear defense. The letter stated
that SFC eliminated the leadership conference as useless.
We would like to point out that the 1959 leadership con-
ference had a great deal to do with two necessary move
(1) the revision of the SFC recognition of student organiz-
ations, and (2) the elimination of the ill-functioning SFC
social committee.

Even without such problems, the leadership conference,
ander a capable executive committee could become a
truly profitable meeting of Bucknell’s student leaders,
perhaps their only opportunity to meet as such and con-
sider the problems of student government and student life
at Bucknell. SFC should be the one organization most
concerned with a unified student approach to university
problems.

SFC’s second defense. is that it did not fail to distribute
faculty-evaluation forms, but decided to evaluate the
forms themselves. We féel that the Faculty evaluation
forms are a valuable means for a professor to gain knowl-
edge of student reaction to his teaching methods. Once
such a system of evaluation has been established, a
prompt application of it near the end of each semester

would be most beneficial’ for both students and faculty. .

Regardless of whether the decision to evaluate the forms
was made after SFC failed to distribute them, we look
forward to a timely distribution of the evaluation forms
_during the spring semester.

SFC’s third defense was of communication. The Buck-
nellian is happy that these editorials, after two and one-
half months, solicited SFC’s most effective public rela-
tions gesture of this term of office: the letter in last week’s
issue. :

We have nothing but good wishes for the incoming of-
ficers of SFC. We hope, however, that they will be able
to contact the campus without the necessity of critical
‘Bucknellian editorials.

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

Dear Editor:

The question of student interest
in the problems facing the present
world interests me no end. The
only trouble that I find with this
growing awareness is that it con-
sists of merely words rather than
actions. Meetings that present
unified statements and sugges-
!tions should be followed by ac-
tion. Before an individual tries
to start an action be should per-
|haps decide upon a subject or an
evil that needs improvement or
rectification. I would like to sug-
gest a subject.

As most Bucknellians know,
this area is, socially speaking,
highly backward. The town does
nothing to help the college stu-
dent and the University does less
For this reason the students have
been forced to accept the super-
ficialities of the fraternity system
What this school needs is a STU-
DENT UNION. Most schools have
| such places, and they add much
to the general campus life and to
the morale of the students. Parts
of this building could contain
dance rooms, recreation -rooms,
| snack bar, music listening rooms,
record collections, and a restau-
rant.

fa project. First, I would suggest

| brary can now exist through its
‘own endowment and that the

| be diverted to such a project.

Secondly, I am sure that if the
trustees would come and look at

The issue can be dragged on
and hashed over for months, but
it seems appropriate for the ad-
ministration to issue a statement
at this time. The campus would
like to know how the University
will “be directly concerned” in
preventing discrimination. What
steps will be taken, relative to
admissions procedures, to insure
a diversified campus population?

Dear Editor:

Immediately after Pearl Harbor
was bombed, Congress was called
into session by the late President
Frankfin D. Roosevelt.. He told
the American people what had
happened, and what we as a na-
tion were going to do about it.

The people of the United States |

heard from their President, not
their Vice-President or any other
member of the administration, as
to what our policy and course of
action against our enemies was to
be.

7 Ber! |
To cite a more recent incident, ;

let us recall the Little Rock epi-
sode. When it was apparent that
the local and state officials of Ar-
kansas could no longer cope with
the segregation problem (pardon
the expression) former President
Eisenhower saw fit to intervene.
He took action because at the

time he was the leader of the}

United States.
this country, he could no longer
remain silent.

These two incidents of leader-

ship are not analagous to what;

should be taking place on this
campus. In the last few issues of
the Bucknellian, ‘the editorial
page has been filled with lette
concerning the policy of discrim-
ination} and proposals for a bet-
ter Bucknell. These letters have
come from the desks of students,
professors, and a lone administra-
tor. Isn’t it time for a letter from
the desk of the President of this
University? :
We are all faced with an im-
portant question: the question of

how Bucknell can become a bet-!

ter institution of higher learning.
We can no longer be blind to the
fact that this university does not
have a very heterogeneous stu-
dent body. This could be the re-
sult of certain requests made by
the application forms. :
We must seek the truth if this
university is going to be a center

of independent thought, which,!

by the way, is one of the main ob-
jectives cited in the Bucknell cat-
alog. But the truth must be ac-
companied by strong leadership.
We ask the President of Bucknell
University to lead us, and put an
end to this probing in the dark.
Sincerely yours,
Bob Heller

as it is sometimes called) which is the study of word origins

ard the same dinghy!

Well sir, chastened and made wiser by, their brush with death,
they fell into each other’s arms and wept and exchanged for-
giveness and hétame fast friends all over again.

For three years they drifted in the dinghy, shaking hands and
singing the Cal Tech rouser all the while. Then, at long last,
they spied a passing liner and were taken aboard.

They remained fast friends for the rest of their days, which,
I regret to report, were not many, because the liner which picked

them up was the Titanic.

What a pity that Marlboros were not invented during the
lifetimes of Bulb, Gas, and Candle! Had there been Marlboros,
these three friends never would have grown apart because they
would have known how much, despite their differences, they still
had in common. I mean to say that Marlboros can be lit by
candle, by gas, or by electricity, and no matter how you light
them, you always get a full-flavored smoke, a filter cigarette
with an unfiltered taste that makes anyone—including Bulb,
Gas, and Candle—settle back and forget anger and strife and
smile the sweet smile of friendship on all who pass!

brand-new unfiltered king-size Philip Morris Commander.

ents used in the making of it to
know he is going to see some-
thing different. But what does
one find here? Only a story about
ordinary human beings, all hay-
ing faults and virtues; this is the
major problem. We have become
so used to seeing stereotyped
characters and situations on the
screen that when “the misfits”
come along, it is difficult to ac-
custom oneself to them.

If the power of The Misfits had
to be attributed to a single force,
this force would be the words of
Arthur Miller, for he has some-
thing important to say. We are
all searching for the meaning of
life. If there is one, few of us
find it, and perhaps it can only be
found through the understanding,
kindness and love of human re-
lationships. Mr. Miller uses all
his characters to express his phi-
losophy, but in no one is this more
obvious than in Rosalind, the
unifying factor of the entire
movie. fs

Rosalind is so beautifully play-
ed by Miss Monroe that I wonder
at the competence of the critics,
who, after watching her in this
film, say that she cannot act. She
captures attention in every scene

Last Saturday afternoon Shaw’s
Dark Lady of the Sonnets and
Strindberg’s The Stronger were
performed in Bucknell Hall as
part of the Burma-Bucknell en-
tertainment program. The Shav-
ian comedy, directed by Barbara
Billings was not the best of all
possible one-act plays to perform
before a predominantly foreign
audience.

This play, which leans natural-
ly toward farcial situations, un-
covers the poetic geniuses who
are responsible for Shakespeare’s

Clift, in short, have never been |
better. Each handles his role}
with such sincerity that they |
overwhelm one with their nafur- |
alism, and with the expert direc-
tion of John Huston and the per-
fectly placed music of Alex North,
all help create an outstanding
movie that is at once bold, fresh,
and exciting.

From beginning to end, The;
Misfits glows with a vitality that
never, not for a single moment,
diminishes in its intensity. Each
individual is portrayed with such |
depth and feeling that, when he
is on the screen, one has little

characters. This is a motion pic-
ture that does not make one think |
afterwards about other people,
but about himself. I can, there-

offer The Misfits than to say that
it belongs among the finest Amer-
ican films ever produced.

FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1961.

In the past, Mr. Idzerda stated,
| the function of the artist was to
create the ethos of a society, to
give significance and form to life,
‘and to enlarge experience. Gea-
| erally the artist held a position of

| honor and found patrons among

the ruling class, as in the age of

Pericles, the Medici, and Louis
XIV.

During the last two centunes,
however, “the words ‘artist’ and
‘alienation’ have become synony-
mous.” The artist is generalty
characterized by such terms as
-poor, eccentric, and of low mor-
ality. The essence of his aliena-
tion lies in the fact that he must
struggle to maintain the integrity
of his work, and that he frequent-
ly lowers his standards or re-
nounces art entirely.

‘Lowering Standards 1
An excellent point was brought
out by Mr. Spielman when he said
that the lowering of standards
was absolutely. out of the ques-
‘tion. Such a thing would mean
taking a paternalistic attitude to-
ward the Negroes. Negro qua
Negra is less able to overcome
low economic status than the
white. This is only a basis for
furthering discrimination. Spe-
cial laws and special treatment
means his negative privileging
i would continue. This way cheats
both the qualified and unqualified
'Negro. When a Negro commits
a crime against another Negro, he
is punished more lightly because
he’s not considered capable of re-
sponsibility. Such a situation is|
parallel to admitting a Negro to
Bucknell om lower standards. He
must suffer because we don’t
know how to aid him.
| Both Mr. Zeller and Mr. Spiel-
man expressed the opinion’ that}
\the formation of a Student Union
at Bucknell could help alleviate
}some of the social pressures |
causéd by the fraternity and sor-|
| ority systems.
| At this point in the discussion, |
Marvin Kahan interrupted the/
speakers in order to allow the au-|
| dience ar opportunity to ask que
tions and voice their own opin
ions. Everyone was eager to have}
his say and the questions ranged |
|from the position of the Board of |
Trustees on such matters as dis-|
crimination, to the possibilities of |
encouraging Negro applicants. {
All those who attended the dis-
cussion will agree that the time}
was well spent. The panel was

views were thought-provoking to
all concerned students.

YOUTH CORPS

by Gail Morrell

The Youth Corps that President
Kennedy spoke of during his
campaign may soon be a reality!
College administration and edu-
cators have answered favorably
and letters from ecollege presi-
dents pour in daily. Although
the program must be authorized
by Congress, a contract has al-
ready been made wtih the Inter-
national Cooperation Association
to plan for 150 young American
teachers to be sent to East Afri-
can schools by the end of June.

Do you fit into one of the three
groups to be sent?

1.’ Fifty certified young teach-
ers with some experience in
secondary schools.

2. Fifty liberal arts graduates
of the class of '61. with no teacher |
training. |

3. Fifty ’61 graduates with ed-|
ucatioh training but no experience
beyond practice teaching.

All candidates must be first-
rate academically, especially in
fields such as English, history,
geography, math and the sciences. |
They must be professionally out- |

so. Personal resourcefulness,
imagination, a spirit of service
without paternalism, and a spirit
of adventure are prerequisites, as
is a knowledge of American life
and a readiness to learn about |
other cultures.

The names of interested stu-
dents filling these requirements

Dr. Idzerda stated, however,
that during the past two or three
decades the extent of the artist’s
alienation has decreased. Society
is once again learning to “take
the artist in stride.’ Technologi-

‘Eugenics Topic

Of Next Forum

The peta topic of
whether or not there should be
any guidance of human evolution
is the subject of the next Buck-
nell Forum Dr. Irwin I. Oster
of the Cancer Research Institute,
Hermann J. Mul-
ler’s views on this subject. Dr.
Muller, a professor at the Uni-
versity of Indiana, is also a Dees
geneticist, and recently re
the Nobel Prize for his Hicessshal
kidney transplant operation in
twins.

Dr. Muller is in favor of arti-
ficial and forced breeding to im-
prove the human race, which, he
feels, is presently stagnant. The
Forum will debate the scientific
possibility of such a proposal, and
the desirability of such a process,
considering the philosophical, re-
ligious, and sociological problems
involved.

These few quotations from an
article in the New York Times
ig Dr. Muller’s views
may provide an insight into the
type of discussions which may
evolve. Dr. Muller has said “from
now on evolution is what we
make it, provided we choose the
good and the true—otherwise we
shall sink back into oblivion.” He
protests that “modern culture is
giving rein to biological deca-
dence,” and insists that there
must | “increasing recognition
by individuals of their responsi-
(for) the genetic

ceeding them.” He further wishes
that “the attitude toward repro
duction were more rational and
more socially directed.”

Dr. Robert Neidorf will moder-
ate a panel consisting of Pro:
sors Robert Butts, Carl Helms
Mark Ebersole, and Ralph Spiel-
man. These men will discuss the
ramifications of these views in re-
gard to their particular fields.

Bucknell Forum is March 22, at
8 p.m. in Vaughan Literature Au-

Our New Role

We note with pleasure the vanishing of an inferiority
complex that has plagued Bucknell for years. There has,
in the past, been a general lack of pride in Bucknell
among both faculty and students, and the question, “Why
did you ever come here?” has been asked on this campus
all too often. Freshmen are disillusioned by the lack of
“school spirit” and the fact that Bucknell is too near, in
some respects, to the idyllic American college delineated
by our advertising culture, and too far from it in others.
Saturated ‘with trite pictures of football heroes in letter
sweaters hand in hand with a campus queen and with
stories of undying devotion for one’s school, we have felt
that we lack a uniqueness or personality as a university.
We are not overwhelmed by picturesque traditions, but is
«the absence of this sort of thing a real loss?

More significant causes for feeling inferior have been
low standards among both faculty and students. We have
had poor teachers, plenty of “Ivy-league rejects,” and
poor academic programs in some fields. The lack of di-
rection among many of our students is superimposed on
our idea of the university as a whole. Bucknell has been
a school stuffed with post-high school students who sought
to go to college in the “American tradition.”

In the past several years, this inferiority complex has
begun to vanish. If it is not because we are now one of
the top schools in the country, it is because we are obvi-

ously well on our way to being a thoroughly respectable
one. There is great cause to be proud of a school that is
so distinctly on the rise, as is Bucknell. The quality of
the faculty and the academic program at Bucknell con-
tinues to improve. Our admission standards would em-
barass few American colleges. The lack of direction on
a sleepy campus is disappearing. Bucknell is awake; it
may still be stretching and yawning, but it is determined
to be a first-class uniiversity.

We are in a stage of transition. We are revising every-
thing from the curriculum to student government. We
have serious students who are determined to utilize their
capacities to the fullest. We have notable visiting lectur-
ers, valuable educational and social programs such as
Challenge and Burma-Bucknell Weekend, and first rate
performing artists. We are losing our old role as an aca-
demic country club, and assuming a new role as a com-
petent educational institution. We do not mean to imply
that Bucknell has any reason to rest on its laurels, but
simply to point out that we have much on which to pride
ourselves.

Plicsmiont- For Whom?

The work of the Bureau of Placement at Bucknell is
growing in importance, for it is through this bureau that
many students expect to find satisfactory jobs after they
graduate. It seems, however, that not all students re-
ceive an equal opportunity for job interviews, for the Bu-
reau appears to cater to business and natural science stu-
dents. (The department of education has its own place-
ment bureau). But what guidance aid is provided for the
student with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English or phy-
ehology, who may, for example, be interested in a career
in journalism or advertising?

It is clear that Bucknell, am independent liberal arts col-
lege, has no special responsibility to recruit more teachers
for the public schools, more engineers and scientists or
more management trainees for any particular industry.
While individual faculty members may ‘support special
programs—usually graduate study in their own fields—
the college, generally, and the placement director, specif-
ically, should not be identified with any special occupa-
tional interest.

We realize that it is the task of the student with a gen-
eral liberal arts background to specify his future occupa-
tional interests. The Placement Bureau, however, has
failed to provide many of the graduating seniors with
competent’ assistance and guidance through appropriate
placement activities. One may argue that advertising
firms and publishing houses have such limited demands
for new graduates that they see no necessity in represent-
ing themselves at Bucknell

Generally speaking, most job opportunities are publiciz-
ed via the “mass medium” or a single bulletin board in
the rear of the book store. Occasionally, personal notices
supplement the lists on the bulletin board. We suggest
the institution of a system to provide advance publicity of
all impending job “recruiters” for seniors whose fields of
study correspond to the types of jobs available.

Would it not be possible to classify each senior student
according to his field of study and send him a mimeo-
graphed list of the firms interviewing for jobs relevant to
his field? Since a majority of the firms are scheduled in
advance by the Placement Bureau, a temporary program
could be compiled listing the expected arrival of the rep-
resentatives at Bucknell. Publicizing interview dates in
this manner would not only be advantageous to the stu-
dent, but would save a great deal of time for the em-
ployees of the Placement Bureau. Individual notification
of senior students would enable them to be more selective
in their choice of job offers and would provide better in-
surance for their future occupational satisfaction.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

March 12, 1961

Dear Editor:

! As habitual movie-goer, I
{was very pleased to find that
among the features of the Buck-
nellian there has been included a
movie review, “At The Movies”
by Joel Flegler. I now have the
chance to compare my opinions
{with those of another interested
person. However, after last
week’s column, I have serious
doubts about the competency of
Mr. Flegler. |
; It. would be ridiculous for me!
to expect Mr. Flegler’s views to
coincide with mine, since we all
have different opinions and tastes.
Nevertheless, it would seem to me
that if Mr. Flegler bases his opin-
ions solely on those things which
{he mentioned in his column, his
opinions are worth absolutely
nothing.

Mr. Flegler’s first argument in
defense of The Misfits concerns
the great combination of talents
jwhich went into making this
‘movie. One could gather the
greatest artists of our time and
cast them for a film, but their
mere presence is not going to
;make that film exceptional. The
|same is true with exepnse. The
jcost of this film was tremendous,
|but that is no guarantee that the
|result was worthwhile.
| In reading the description of
the characters as “ordinary hu-
‘}man beings,” I began to wonder
about Mr. Flegler’s past environ-
|ment. If these people are ordi-
nary, I must have been brought
up on Mars. Perhaps I am being
| unjust; Mr. Flegler has probably
' spent more time in Reno studying
divorcees than I.

As far as Miss Monroe’s acting

an

jeven say anything in order to
make this letter printable. Cer-
tainly two hours of her squeeking
and over-emotional “dramatic”
acting is enough to ruin just
about anyone’s day. I must ad-
mit, however, that the acting of

ceptional, and that this one thing
kept the movie bearable.

MSG Candidates Speak

by Art Gardner

With the increase of interest in
the purpose of the ‘student at
Bucknell my own desire to see
something accomplished has been
increased to the extent that I am
running for MSG President. As
evidence of this interest the ex-
ecutive council of the MSG has
taken applications, interviewed,
and is now publicizing the cam-
paign for the next executive
council. As president of the MSG
I would stimulate the purpose
during the course of the entire
year as well as the present execu- |
tive has stimulated the .purpose |
just for elections this year. It is

my intention that the MSG would |

follow
the men students. The guidance
which the purpose indicates has
been continuously side-stepped by

the leaders and is presently being |

overlooked by the new SFC with
omnipotent inclinations.
Unanimous decisions of
group of brain-washed conform-
ists.
remedied by an executive who
would prod and provoke his as-
sembly to action.
Board Dispute which has plagued
us for a whole year would be
closer to a settlement if the ex-
ecutive council of the MSG and
the Judicial Board met under
some agreement of mediation
rather than taking.occasional ver-
bal swipes at each other which
somewhat resembles the game,
“King of the Mountain,” and vio-
lates the code of brotherhood. |
The main stunting medicine af- |
fecting the MSG is the adminis- |
tration. This is not to infer that |
the administration is against the
MSG, but rather that it is not;
clearly for the MSG. If I am}
elected, either the MSG will fol-
low its purpose as interpreted by
the executive council or the MSG
will cease to exist. \

Having served as treasurer on

the Executive Council of MSG];

during the past year, I have be-
come very familiar with the way
the MSG functions, the types of
activities in which it is involved,
and the means by which these
activities are accomplished. Dur-
ing my term as treasurer I have
also acquired a very honest and
sincere desire to continue my
work in this organization towards i
the achievement of the purposes |
| of the Men’s Student Government,
which are to further the welfare
of the men students and to more
closely integrate the MSG with
the administration and the WSGA. ,

One problem which has plagued |
| MSG for the three years that I
| have been at Bucknell is the gen- |
eral lack of interest shown by the |
|male students in MSG. I would
like to see MSG built up to oc-
‘cupy its proper position of esteem
among the University’s organiza- |
tions since it represents approxi- |
‘mately two-thirds of the student
body. This, I believe, can be
done by publicizing the activities
of the MSG much more than h
been done in the past, especially |
in the form of articles in the}
Bucknellian. To perform this
particular task, I would appoint,
or have the Executive Council
select, another ‘member-at-large
who would attend the Executive |
Council’s meetings and write a
written report of the proceedings
to be published in the Bucknell-
ian following every meeting. In
this way, a greater awareness
and interest would be instilled
within the student body.

I would also advocate the con-
tinuance of the Steering Commit-
tee which was initiated by last
year’s President, as I feel it is a
helpful tool for the proper func-
tioning of any organization. The
Steering Committee even in its!
infancy, served its purpose very;
well and provided the MSG with |
a number of suggestions and proj- |

ed upon,

Since many of our pep rallies |

Varied Summer
Session Planned

Bucknell University will offer
a variety of cultural and intellect-
ual programs this summer in ad-
dition to the regular courses of
the su ssion, Dr. Frank W.
Merritt,

School, announced today.

Each week throughout the six-
week session which begins June
2 a distinguished professor or
creative artist will visit the cam-
pus to present a series of five
classroom lectures and a special
evening lecture for the benefit of
the public. One of those sched-
uled to participate is Arthur S.
Link of Princeton University, who
is editing the Woodrow Wilson
Papers at the Firestone Library
at Princeton.

In addition to the numerous
special lectures for students and
general public, a series of con-
certs, art exhibitions and lecture-
demonstrations will be held. One
of the most popular, the chamber |
music series, under the direction ;
of Lindsey Merrill, assistant pro- |
fessor of music, will be presented |
for the fourth consecutive sum>)
mer. : {

Besides ‘regular six-week study
programs on both the graduate |
and undergraduate level, six spe- |
cial summer institutes will be}
conducted during the summer
months. They include National |
Science Foundation Institutes for |
high school science students, high
school teachers in science and)
mathematics, and college teachers
of physics and pre-engineering;
the Institute for Foreign Students; |
the Institute for Asian Studies; |
and the Institute of American
Studies. |

The last named Institute was |
recently selected by the Freedoms |
Foundation as one of the out-
standing college campus programs
of 1960. It will receive the!
Foundation’s George Washington |
Honor Medal later this year in
recognition of its objective of en-
couraging and promoting the
American way of life.

Europe Offers Opportunities for Summer Jobs;

A student who is accepted in
the American Student Informa-
ition Service program pays a
“European Safari” fee of any-

price depends on whether you
decide on an abbreviated or fair-
ly extensive introductory tour of
Europe. (The most modest A. S.
I. S. tour lasts two days, and the
longest is fifty-three). For your
money, you get a round-trip flight
New York to Europe, the intro-
ductory tour with hotel accom-
modations and meals (except
lunches), travel by chartered bus,

and health and accident insurance |

while you are abroad. ASIS also
throws in free language records
and a guidebook and a student
pass entitling you to certain dis-
counts. :

To join the American Student
Information Service, a student
must fill out an application form
(Major? Work experience? Hob-
bies? Foreign language?) and
pay a membership fee of $24. dol-
lars. When ASIS accepts your
application and fee, they guaran-
tee you both a job and a place
on an ASIS tour. A student who
applies early (the deadline this
year is April 10) is most likely to
be placed in a congenial job and
country.

Students with speaking knowl-
edge ofFrench or German qualify
for the widest variety of jobs:
Camp counseling and child-care

bs usually go to those with some

ge skill as do resort and

otel jobs (except kitchen assign-
ments). ASIS likes to place stu-
dents who know only a few basic
foreign words and phrases on the
farms and with hospitals and in-
ternational student work camps.

For more information about
ASIS—the various tour-plans, the
jobs and how to qualify for them

formation Service, e. V., Jahn-

rasse 56-a, Frankfurt am Main,

i Critics of the American Student

where from $345 to $795—the;

Information Service say that, per-
haps because it is a young busi-
ness, it has proved somewhat
short on organization.( Last sum-
mer there was quite a bit of last-
minute scurrying around to match
up students and jobs, and some of
the tour schedules got all fouled
up. One group, for instance, had
to spend a week in Amsterdam—

at their own expense—waiting |

for a tour to get underway). The

| fact remains, however, that ASIS|
provides one of the few, sure-fire |
ways for the average student to}

get a summer job in Europe.
Camp Counseling
Mile Yvonne Baille of the
French Embassy’s Cultural Divi-
sion (972 Fifth Avenue, New York

selor positions in France. Age
limit: 18 to 30. Requirement:
must speak French well. Salary:
board, room and pocket money
No job experience is necessary,
but applicants should know some-
thing about children, swimming
and camp activities.
Selling Newspapers

The New York Herald Tribune
—European Edition—hires Amer-
ican college girls to hawk its
newspapers in major cities on the
Continent. Sales girls are paid
$2.60 a day plus a commission of
four cents per copy sold (during
the tourist season), they often
earn six to nine dollars a day).
The Tribune is looking for appli-
cants with “a good appearance”
who would be able to “push the
paper.” (Pushing, it is said, in-
cludes quite a bit of shouting).

At the Movies

by Joel Flegler

Although the Indian motion pic-
ture industry releases more films
every year than Hollywood, most
of them are considered too in-
ferior to be shown here.. But
with Satyajit Ray’s world re-
nowned trilogy, Pather Panchali
(1956), Aparajito (1957, and The
World of Apu (1960), Western
moviegoers have had the chance
to see the work of a master ar-
tist. :

Ray has taken the everyday oc-
currences of life, projected them
on the screen with as much na-
turalism as is possible, and filled
them with such detail and sub-
tlety that the most unimportant
or common happening achieves 2

twaking up Apu, the Aunt’s ex-
{pression when she gives up all
‘hope of anyone wanting her, or
|Apu’s first moments alone with
‘his bride. All this is filmed with
‘what might be described as an
|almost primitive type of photog-
jraphy, a deeply sensitive style
‘that adds more realism to the
\drama. The lagging pace of the
| movies, difficult to adjust to at
‘first, seems slow only in compari-
‘son to other films; Ray creates a
‘unique, relaxed, and appealing
‘mood that is sustained through-
out the film.

Of the two films recently shown
here, Pather Panchali is unques-
tionably the superior. The World
of Apu has all of its predecessor’s
virtues, but, unfortunately, to a
lesser degree. There is an “un-
touched by Western hands” qual-
ity to the first of the trilogy that

“LOVE IN REVERSE”

They met. His heart leapt. “I love you,” he cried.

“Me, too, hey,” she cried.

“Tell me,” he eried, “are you a girl of expensive tastes?”

“No, hey,” she cried, “I am a girl of simple tastes.”

“Good,” he cried, “for my cruel father sends me an allowance
barely large enough to support life.”

“Money does not matter to me,” she eried. “My tastes are
simple, my wants are few. Just take me riding in a long, new,
yellow convertible and I am content.’

“Goodbye,” he cried, and ran away as fast as his chubby little
legs could carry him, for he had no convertible, nor the money to
buy one, nor the means to get the money, short of picking up his
stingy father by the ankles and shaking him till his wallet
fell out.

He knew he must forget this girl but, lying on his pallet at the
dormitory, whimpering and moaning, he knew he could not.

At last an idea came to him: though he did not have the money
to buy a convertible, perhaps he had enough to rent onet

Hope reborn, he rushed at once to an automobile rental
company and rented a yellow convertible for $10 down plus 10¢

and through bosky dells.”’

And away they drove. All that day and night they drove and

finally, tired but happy, they parked high on a windswept hill.
“Marlboro?” he said.

“Yum yum,” she said.

They lit up. They puffed with deep contentment. “You
know,” he said, “you are like a Marlboro—mild and fresh
and relaxing.”

“But there is a big difference between Marlboro and me,”’ she
said, “because I do not have a Selectrate filter nor do I come
in soft pack or flip-top box.’

They laughed. They kissed. He screamed.

“What is it, my dear,” she cried, alarmed.

“Look at the speedometer,” he said. “We have driven 200
miles and this car costs 10¢ a mile and I have only $20 left.”

“But that’s exactly enough,” she said.

“Yes,” be said, “but we still have to drive home.”

They fell into a profound gloom. He started the motor and
backed out of the parking place.

“Hey, look!” she said. “The speedometer doesn’t move when
you’re backing up.” ~

He looked. It was.true. “Eureka!” he cried. “That solves my
problem. I will drive home in reverse. Then no more miles will
register on the speedometer
to pay!”

*T think that’s a marvelous idea,” she said, and she was right.
Because today our hero is in the county jail where food clothes

and lodging are provided free of charge and his alparniog is

to attend. I knew that I would prefer to attend a small college where
I could obtain a good education. Attendance at a smaller college
would also have the advantage of affording more opportunities to
meet people. I felt that I would like to attend a college where some-
one like me had not recently, or perhaps had never attended. As it
happened, Bucknell was to be the place where I would continue my
education.
Math Major

All through my secondary education, my major interest was
mathematics. My father’s work involves mathematics and I guess I
inherited the interest from him. Mother asserts that her interests
were not so inclined. I felt that if given the opportunity to continue
my education, I would major in mathematics. Thus, I now find my-
self as a mathematics major at Bucknell. ;

One of the major aims of the University is to instill in the stu-
dent a desire to pursue knowledge—truth. Already I have found that
Bucknell offers one such an opportunity to pursue knowledge if one
so desires. However, I am also aware of the fact that four years is
a rather brief time to spend.in this pursuit. I could very easily add}
an additional four years of courses I would like to take, and perhaps
with each new course this number would increase.

However, fortunately or unfortunately, depending upon which
way one looks at the situation, one must also prepare for future em- |
ployment after those brief four years. You probably wonder what
I intend to do?

Teaching Mathematics
At this moment I can see two possibilities for me. I would like |
to be able to either teach mathematics, or to work with mathematics |

ballets presented on each of the
two nights are said to be in the
repertory of no other dance com-
panies; after having seen the per-
formance, this statement is not
difficult to believe.

The first ballet on the program,
Chez Tchaikovsky, depicted the
impressions of the young world
of the Russian composer a hun-
dred years ago—the gracious so-
cial life, the dreams of a poet's
secret mind, and the hearty pleas-
ures of a rustic winter. The
theme and the choreography for
this ballet were basically well
designed, but the Corps de Ballet
lacked the talent needed to do it
justice. A group of sub-teenage
ballerinas could have presented it
just as convincingly as the Solov
Company.

Allegresse, sheer movement,
without plot or story, set to the

|brilliant music of Felix Mendel-

ssohn-Bartholdy was valuable

been some opportunities for a teacher of mathematics iin the various |
schools for the blind in the United States. However in recent years. |
with the trend of capable blind students continuing their education |
in “sighted schools,” there only remains, in many instances, the
teaching of elementary math in such schools.

I believe I would much rather prefer teaching in a normal school
if possible. I realize that there will be many problems for me in
teaching in a public school, but I do not feel that the prospective
problems would find no solutions. I have already mentioned in aj
previous article that there have been blind teachers in the fields of |
physics and mathematics, and I should like to have the opportunity |
to join that number. : |

I would be interested in your reactions or comments upon such
an undertaking. Perhaps some of you may have suggestions upon ;
possible teaching methods I could use. If so, I would appreciate dis- |
cussing them with you. I would also appreciate hearing what your|
reactions might be if you walked into a class to find me, or someone |
like me, as the teacher.

¢ Statisticcl] Worker

The other possibility for me in the field of mathematics after
graduation is working as a statistician or in some other mathematic-
ally oriented employment. This possibility has just recently been
made known to me, and perhaps such employment might prove more
feasible than teaching.

i

I shall be taking my first statistics course |

next year, and perhaps after this course I shall be in a better position |

for evaluating the possibilities of employment.

‘And thus it stands. Whether I shall become a teacher of mathe-
matics, or work in industry with mathematics remains for the future
to reveal.

To Explain Levacar

A striking new development in}
the’ automotive field, the Levacar, |
a vehicle which rides on a cush- |
ion of high pressure air, will be!
discussed and demonstrated at)
the March meeting of the Central |
Pennsylvania Section of  the|
American Society of Mechanical}
Engineers on Monday, March 20, |
at 7:30 p.m. in Coleman Hall |
Theatre.

On hand to explain the princi-
ples of this revolutionary new}
mode of transportation will be!
David J. Jay, Levacar project!
manager of Ford Motor Com-|
pany’s engineering and research }
staff. Mr. Jay will also bring with |
him a working model of the ve)
hicle in order to demonstrate how }
Levacar functions. |

According ‘to Ford officials,
Levacar could conceivably attain
speeds upwards of 500 miles per
hour while using nominal power.
Reduced frictional drag and the}
corresponding ‘reduction in power |
required to drive ‘the vehicle are |
the reasons given for achieving |
such speeds.

Ballots for choosing the
gift will be sent to each member
of the senior class after the Spring
Vacation

The first committee propos:
to purchase furniture for the
ounge in the new wing alumni
offices of the Vaughan Literature
Building. A plaque would be
placed in the lounge to signify
the class gift.

The second proposal is to land-
cape the new quadrangle formed
by Bertrand Library, Coleman
Hall and the Vaughan Literature
Building. The landscape plan
would be developed by an archi
tect hired by the University. A
plaque, probably placed some-
where near the middle of the
quadrangle, would again signify
the class gift.

The third proposla is to invest
the money designated for the
class gift in a mutual fund such
as the “Dryfus Fund”. The
money would remain in the fund
accumulating interest until the
25th reunion of the class. At that
time, the interest on the principl
would be used to provide an an-

Dean Releases
Senior Scores

The results of the Area Tests of
the Graduate Record Examina-
|tions, given to the Class of 1961
on Feb. 21, have been released by
|Dean Karl D. Hartzell.
| Three hundred and ninety-five
| students participated in the tests
{given in the morning session, in
\the fields of the social sciences,
{the humanities, and the natural
‘sciences. Afternoon tests were
| given in specific areas of study.
| Information from these tests
| will be used to evaluate the
| standing of the students, both in
their own class and on the na-
tional level, and also to evaluate
departmental and the University
standards. In comparing the
scores of the Classes of 1959 and
1960 with the most recent scores,
it has been noted that the aver-
age scores are higher this year.
There were gains of 15 points in
the Humanities Test and 28 points
in the Natural Science Test. In
these two tests the seniors scored
above the national group, which
included students from 21 colleges
selected by the Educational Test-
ing Service. However, they scor-
ed slightly lower in the Social
Science Test.

Intellect or Bust!

It has recently been pointed out that Bucknell’s stand-
ards are rapidly being raised. The students are better
qualified, the faculty more capable, and the academic pro-
gram more challenging. On these bases, Bucknell could
compete with many of the country’s top ranking schools;

The distinguished men: and

but we doubt that they rank with the most mature. They
are potentially useful, but at Bucknell, are not acquiring
the sort of motivations, desires and interests that would
make them more prominent citizens. A college freshman
is a very malleable person. He comes to school not know-
ing exactly what he is going to experience, or what role
he will play (as our ‘freshman counselers can testify).
Bucknell has the opportunity to mold these individuals,
but it does not. The very atmosphere of the campus could
promote interest in world politics, the meaning of educa-
tion, the role of the engineer in our society, or the future
of labor, simply by association and absorption. We fail,
however, to fulfill this aspect of our responsibility.

A college student may choose to be an intellectual,
orienting his college experience primarily toward the de-
velopment of his mind; or he may be a diletante, with his
attention divided among his studies, social and extra-cur-
ricular activities, and athletics. Bucknell life is geared
toward the diletante. To be sure, it is a pleasant experi-
ence to approach what Bucknell has to offer as a bee ap-

It affects the motivations and values of the individual. It

a refining influence. People invest in higher education,

because it is one of the best opportunities society has of

I WAS A TEEN-AGE SLIDE RULE

In a recent learned journal (Mad) the distinguished board
chairman (Ralph “Hot-Lips” Sigafoos) of one of our most
important American corporations (the Arf Mechanical Dog Co.)
wrote a trenchant article in which he pinpointed our gravest
national problem: the lack of culture among science graduates.
Mr. Sigafoos’s article, it must be emphasized, was in no sense
derogatory. He stated quite clearly that the science student,
what with his gruelling curriculum in physies, math, and chem-
istry, can hardly be expected to find time to study the arts
too. What Mr. Sigafoos deplores—indeed, what we all deplore
~is the lopsided result of today’s science courses: graduates
who can build a bridge but can’t compose a concerto, who know
Planck’s Constant but not Botticelli’s Venus, who are familiar
with Fraunhofer’s lines but not with Schille:
Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this hideous imbalance.
I, however, believe there is one—and a very simple one. It is
this: if students of science don’t have time to come to the arts,
then we must let the arts come to students of science

It is in this intellectual realm where Bucknell lags be-
hind its potential. Our social structure, our extra-curric-
ular activities, even our students, are geared to diletant-
ism. We become like a high class, co-educational sum-
mer camp, with plenty of social opportunities, arts and
crafts. Such experience is valuable, but it is not what
college was meant to be. We are cheating not only so-
ciety and the people that invest in us; we are cheating
ourselves. It is time for intellectualism to become a mat-
ter of pride on this campus. We must—and we can—be-
come more than we are, by applying our resources more
intensely.

To Tell the Truth

We, the new Editorial Board of the Bucknellian, look
ahead to a year of great responsibility—the responsibility
of keeping some 2,500 students, faculty, and other readers
informed. Our task has been defined for us by previous
editorial boards, and our goal must be the maintenance or
enhancement of the present quality of this publication

In the coming months we will attempt to present you,
our readers, with the facts—not as one individual (or even
one group) sees them, but as conscientious investigation
proves them valid. We feel that misrepresentation of the
facts, or an inadequate presentation of facts, is definitely
out of keeping with our policy of honesty and fairness.

Realizing that in order to be effective, a campus news-
paper must serve as a mouthpiece for student, faculty.
and administrative opinion, the Bucknellian staff invites
its readers to submit information and opinions. We also
welcome constructive criticism, for we feel that your
ideas and views may help us to better fulfill our responsi-
bility to readers on and off the campus.

| ficers in room 202 of Bertrand Li- ,
|brary to decide if such a group
should exist and how it should

'animously voted it into existence,

| 1. Dr. Hollister was chosen as|
‘class advisor. (He has since then |

4. Other points included the
tentative planning of a class
meeting for April 6, purchase of
class stationery, and mutual cor-
respondence with freshman class
presidents at Penn State and Del-
aware universities.

It is the hope of FIDC members

that our group, which is in.ac-;

tuality a class council, will be
continued from year to year until

It is, rather, an atmosphere which }
seems to hover over the campus,
an atmosphere composed of a fear.
to act because logic and truth are
overshadowed by ignorance of}
the facts; an atmosphere of innate
prejudices—again a fault of ig-
norance; an atmosphere of gen-
eral complacency which is a
plague in itself. No one can plead
complete innocence in any of
these areas; but still we can act
to try to erradicate this atmos-
phere and therefore discrimina-
tion itself.

If each would make the effort
to realize and try to correct his
own attitude of prejudice, a big
step would be taken toward re-
storing “Christian| Tradition” to
its original definition. “What's
the connection?”, you may ask.
How could the university define
the phrase as applied to their ob-
jectives when they have no as-
surance that this definition would
be enforced by the members of
the Bucknell family? How can
they state a ploicy of non-discrim-
ination knowing discrimination
exists in the dorms and class-
rooms — subtle discrimination?
How can we even invite Negro
students here where it is not cer-
tain that they will be accepted
into the Bucknell social circle?

The movements asking action
from the administration must be
accompanied by action: from the
students and faculty. Declare
how you feel! Know why you
feel the way you do. Then act
according to your beliefs. Let's
get busy, I’m also tired of hearing
this word “discrimination”.

For example, it would be'a very easy thing to teach poetry
and music right along with physics. Students, instead of merely

being called upon to recite in physics class, would instead be
required to rhyme their answers and set them to familiar tunes
—like, for*instance, The Colonel Bogey March. Thus recitations
would not only be chock-full of important facts but would, at
the same time, expose the student to the aesthetic delights of
great music. Here, try it yourself. You all know The Colonel
Bogey March. Come, sing along with me:

Physics

Is what we learn in class.

Einstein

Said energy is mass.

Newton

Ts highfalutin

And Pascal's a rascal. So’s Boyle

Do you see how much more broadening, how much more
uplifting to learn physics this way? Of course you do. What?
You want another chorus? By all means:

Leyden

He made the Leyden jar.

Trolley

He made the Trolley car.

Curie q

Rode in a-surrey,

And Diesel’s a weasel. So’s Boyle.

Once the student has mastered The Colonel Bogey March, he
can go on to more complicated melodies like Death and Trans-
Jiguration, the Eroica, and Love Me Tender.

And when the student, loaded with science and culture,
leaves the classroom and lights his Marlboro, how much more
he will enjoy that filter, that flavor, that pack or box! Because
there will no longer be an unease gnawing at his soul, no longer
a little voice within him repeating that he is culturally a dolt.
He will know—know joyously—that he is a fulfilled man, a
whole man, and he will bask and revel in the pleasure of his
Marlboro as a colt rolls in new grass—content, complete, truly
educated—a credit to his college, to himself, and to his tobac-
conist!

Griffis’ Bucket Wins, 51-50

by Ted Odenwald

The first annual faculty-intra-
mural all-star game turned into a
fun-filled 32-minute fiasco Tues-
day as the faculty “won” a 51-50
decision, Going into the final
quarter, the intramural squad led
44-29, but with the assistance of
referee Mike Fadden and Dick
Kniffen the faculty was able to
score a tense come-from-behind

| Philadelphia Runs The MAC |
Each year since the inception of the MAC three teams have dom-
| inated the basketball season. Taking turns routing the rest of the
| conference Temple, St. Joseph’s, and LaSaile have consistently been
the top three teams.

This year, with the exception of two Hawk wins over Temple and|
|a win over LaSalle added to a Temple victory over LaSalle, the
| Philadelphia set went undefeated in the MAC. Hawk coach Jack}
| Ramsey has remarked that, “The upstate teams are constantly im-
| proving,” but apparently this is not in proportion to Big Five ball
| clubs (includes Villanova and Penn).

It’s true that good basketball)

jsyear, the “Phillies-jinx” will be broken.

Hawks Unpredictable In Winning |
St. Joe’s has not exactly walked to the NCAA semi’s. They had
| some rea! scares thrown their way by Albright, Muhlenberg, G-Burg, |
| ann for 30 memorable minutes, Bucknell. They edged a “good” but}
{not outstanding Princeton team and clubbed a torrid Wake Forest
team. They whipped St. John’s, but lost to Pitt. In fact they’re so
| unpredictable that they could make a real contest out of the pending
| Buckeye game.
2 Everybody’s All-American is Human
Jerry Lucas can be “held down,” contrary to popular belief. Ali
jyou have to do is triple téam him. Vince Kempton, 6-8 Hawk cen-}
| ter, has never been better than in the playoffs. Kempton, along with}
|} strong arm Tom Wynne, who demonstrated his physical prowess on
| Bruce Babich, could halt EVERYBODY'S All-Everything.. Lucas can
| get up, though, as demonstrated by his 33 point crushing of Ken-
tucky following a nine-point humiliation by Louisville. Frank Ma-
| jewski, the “Golden Greek,” who nearly jumped out of Davis Gym
on the first rebound of the Bison-Hawk game, had 18 against Wake
Forest, could be the guy to do a job on Larry Siegfried, while Jack

‘Large’ Squad

Af the beginning of the final
stanza, faculty coach Spike Jan-
nides called for a conference with
the referees. After a brief con-
versation, the game was resumed.
Obviously unknown to the ref-
erees, the faculty now had a seven
man squad in action. With the
added heip,. the faculty was able
to tighten up its defenses and
prevent the younger team from
scoring while they cut into the
student's lead.

Griff Scores
With only bne second remaining

lin the game, the faculty, trailing
by two points, 50-48, called for a

time out. As the ball was put
into play it was noticed that the

‘one second of the game lasted
/about a minute and a half and in
\te closing play of the game, Grif-
‘fis sunk a layup with his back to
\the basket, and with two oppon-
ients hanging from his arms. The
| puzzer sounded, eding the game,
jbut Griffis still had a foul shot
lcoming to him. The crowd sat in
jsilent apprehension as “Griff”
|stepped to the foul line. The si-
|lence was broken by Coach Jan-
‘nides’ cry, “Come on Jerry!”
| Griffis’ foul shot swished through
ithe net giving the faculty a vic-
| tory.

ter the game, “They were trying

but for the powerful voices of the
two leads. The less said about
Pajama Game the better; its va-
pidness defies description.

Now Pal Joey is quite a unique
case. It seems that those mys-
terious people behind every musi-
cal production have finally real-
ized that you can’t join an undis-
ciplined voice with an unruly or-
chestra and get anything but
noise. It’s a simple matter of
logistics; you don’t pass ammuni-
tion to the enemy. Evidently the
staff of Pal Joey took a good look
and a long listen to their leads,
became panicky, and immediately
sent for Dorothy Wilson. A
woman of unquestionable talent,
Miss Wilson scored the music for
two pianos, thereby removing a
major obstacle in the path of a
respectable performance.

The next difficulty to be over-
come was casting, and here the
attempt was only partially suc-
cessful. It was curious to notice
that for the identical reasons
Susan Aymar failed last year in
Pajama Game, es eded in
Pal Joey Her shy manner and
small voice perfectly suited the
part of Linda. Unfortunately
the reverse was true of Linda
Garrett. While she might have
looked and acted the part of the
vamp, the impr on immediate-
ly disintergrated when she sang.
Nobody could have looked more
like a Joey than Jeffrey Gaynor.
Tall, slim, and dapper, Mr. Gay-
nor counteracted the effect of his

ing voice with sure and easy
stures, and when not upstaging
hs fellow actors, he was vexing
the audience into envious disap- |
proval of Joey’s exploits.

As inevitably happens in these
musicals, the secondary charact-
ers stole the show. Judy Levy as
Gladys combined the grace of a
ballerina and the vitality of a

perfluous.

Taking everything into consid-
eration, however, it seems that
for a thoroughly superficial and
terribly written musical comedy,
Pal Joey found a pleasant med-
ium with which to interpret its

better moments and a full house!

with which to greet them.

Bill’s View

| be funny).
As far as the rest of the cast
was concerned, the dancing was

again the best dancer, but every-
!body did very nicely and added
jto the sum total of a very good
| show.

The lighting was fine, make-up
was satisfactory, but the sets left

by Wm. Jay Jacobson II | were perfect and the direction of

“Chicago, Chicago, that won- |
derful town . . .” where Pal Joey
takes place, and indeed, from the
view we got from the newly
opened “Chez Joey,” it must be
a wonderful place. |

The first person to give us that}
impression is night-club owner]
Joe LoGrippo, the tough, wise- |
cracking proprietor of “Mike's
Place,” where Pal Joey gets his
start. Then Joey himself makes |
the scene, in the form of Jeff
Gaynor. Now admittedly Joey;
can’t sing, but what the hell, Sin-}
atra can’t act, and so it goes. If
the part had been played any bet- |
ter Sinatra’s agent would have}
sued Gaynor for impersonation, |
and we would have stuck up for |
Jeff, too, because he was great, !
period. |

The next body .on stage is}
night-club floozy Gladys, played;
by Judy Levy, who is just sensa- |
tional. Judy is a pro from the}
word go, and her mimicry, danc-
ing, singing, and acting, made the |
show alive and scintillating. Her
parody of a night club dancer re-
minded me: of Broadway at its
best (or worst, depending on how i
you feel about Broadway), and}

| we could watch Gladys bumping |

and grinding all night long purely
for aesthetic reasons.

by Joel Flegler

Two of the recent elaborate
Hollywood productions have made
me question the often heard pro-
paganda line of our film makers
that “movies are better than
ever.” At least I'd hate to have
to defend that point after having
seen Butterfield 8 and Where the
Boys Are.

First, let’s look at what happen-
ed to Elizabeth Tayor in her lat-
est venture. Miss Taylor does
seem to get into some pretty in-

teresting sexual relationships in}

roles, and this film is no ex-
on. Her unfortunate and un-
vable ending in a blazing car

ruin the movie, someone thought

‘prove one thing—that he could

wife as he could with his first. It

Decidedly not. In fact most executive jobs are on
the ground. Of course, all officers may apply for pilot
and navigator training if they meet the eligibility
requirements. There will always be a need for piloted
aircraft. And it is foreseeable that in your working
lifetime, there will be piloted spacecraft—piloted and
navigated by Air Force officers.

But right now, there is also a big future for college-
trained Air Force officers on the ground. New and
exciting technical jobs are opening up. Important ad-
ministrative positions must be filled as World War IE
officers move into retirement.

How can you—a college student—become an Air
Force officer? First, there’s Air Force ROTC. Then
for college graduates, men and women in certain

fields, there is Officer

Training School. The graduate

of its three-month course wins a commission as a sec-

officer. Starting salary plus allowances compare

with the average in

equivalent civilian jobs. Then

there’s free medical and dental care, thirty-day vaca-

tion, the chance to

win graduate degrees at Air

Force expense, and liberal retirement provisions.

No, Air Force officers do not-need wings to move
up. There’s plenty doing on the ground. Perhaps you
could be one of these young executives in blue. Ask
your local Air Force Recruiter. Or write, Officer

The second objective is to have
students actively go out and in-
fluence minority group members
to come to Bucknell. This is the
strongest influence that we stu-
dents can exert.

The third objective is to con-

vince the Admissions Committee |
that the disadvantage of using |

methods which connote discrim-
ination to some potential appli-
cants far outweigh the advant-
ages the methods provide. Be-
cause of implied and open accusa-
tions, several members of this
committee are justifiably filled
with self-righteous anger. To re-
move the pictures and religious
declarations now gives the ap-
pearance that the committee was
originally guilty of misuse of
these items. I do not believe that
this has been the case, and I have
14 specific instances on which 1
base my reasoning. If students
will go to the trouble to put them-
selves in the committee members’
places, I believe the students have

tions in the desired direction, be-
cause there is much good reason
for this change.

dents, particularly minority group
members.

the SFC constitution, many un-

move toward more unified student

Jack is also the star of the show.
Claudia Warren, his fiancee, plays
opposite him. Jack informs the
players that he expects a Jetter-
perfect rehearsal.

Two shots are fired offstage on
cue by Morton Hill, who is sup-
posedly in love with Claudia, dur-
ing the first love scene between
Jack and his sweetheart. Jack
falls and the rehearsal continues.
The surprise element comes when
it is discovereed that Jack is not
acting at aall. He is DEAD!

Intense excitement permeates,

the atmosphere. The prime sus-
pect is Chubby Forbes who load-
ed the gun. Morton Hill is also
suspected because he, too, is in
love with Claudia. Mrs. Fiske
Warren, Claudia’s real mother, is
another suspect because She very
heartily disapproves of Jack. As
it turns out, Claudia and half of
the town have good reasons for
disposing of Jack Ellery. The
evidence points strongly toward
Mrs. Warren, but further investi-
gation proves that Jack was not
shot, but had been poisoned.

°° DACALA TO HEAD

DEPT. OF RELIGION

Dr. Leon Pacala of Greencastle,
|Ind., has been appointed associate
professor and chairman of the de-
|partment of religion, it was an-
jnounced by Dean Karl D. Hart-
| zell.
| Dr. Pacala, who currently
serves as assistant professor of
|philosophy and religion at De
| Pauw University, will assume his
new post in September. As chair-
man of the department, he suc-
ceeds Dr. Mark C. Ebersole who
jwas recently promoted to the
| position of assistant dean of the
| University.

A native of Indiana, Dr. Pacala
| attended Franklin College, where
he received his bachelor of arts
degree, and Colgate Rochester Di-
vinity School, where he earned
‘the bacheor of divinity degree.

After completing a year of
| Study at Louvain University, Bel-
| gium, under a Rotary Fellowship,
\he returned to this country to
| work on his doctorate. He re-
\ceived his Ph. D. in philosophical
|theology from the Yale Graduate
School, where he was a Univer-
sity Scholar.

Dr. Pacala joined the faculty of
DePauw University as an instruc-
tor in philosophy and religion in
1956 and was promoted to the
rank of assistant professor two
years later. During the 1957-58
academic year he also served as
Lilly Research Director at De-
Pauw, where he conducted an
evaluation of liberal arts signifi-
cance of the teaching of religion.

He is a member of the Ameri-
can Theological Society, the In-
‘diana Philosophical Association
jand the American Philosophical

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

FRIDAY, APRIL 7, 1961.

Evaluate Us?

Every ten years, the Middle States Association evalu-
ates Bucknell University to appraise its total educational
effectiveness. To do this, in the past it has been necessary
to review the total structure and program of this institu-
tion. The results of this conventional evaluation then
determined whether or not Bucknell would be accredited
by them. However, within the past few years, the Middle
States Association has questioned the effectiveness of fol-
lowing this policy, believing that, in many instances, the
evaluation would be far more fruitful if it were limited
to several problem areas which are of particular concern
to the institution. It has been decided that the next eval-
uation of Bucknell, which will take place in April, 1962,
should be of this more limited and specific nature.

Dean Ebersole, chairman of the Bucknell Steering Com-
mittee on the Middle States Evaluation, has disclosed that
five major areas of the University’s program will be re-
viewed in light of its stated objectives. These areas are:
(1) Teaching: How can the faculty utilize more fully the
present or potential resources in order that they may in-
crease their effectiveness as teachers? (2) Extra-curricu-
lar Activities: How can student government, publications,
musical organizations, departmental clubs and societies,
sororities and fraternities, religious organizations, and
total athletic program make their maximum contribution
to the accomplishment of our educational objectives?
(3) Library: How can the library and its total services be
put to the best use? (4) Graduate Study: What are the
most significant steps which we ought to take in order to
improve the quality of our graduate program? (5) Com-
munications: How can we provide for reliable and fruit-
ful discussion and dissemination of policies and ideas
among all participating University groups?

After the three day evaluation is made in 1962, a defi-
nite appraisal of our educational program will be released.
This evaluation will then be used as a chart for Bucknell’s
future development.

LETTERSTO
THE EDITOR -

Editor, The Bucknellian:

Since my function in our uni-
versity administration embraces
programs of financial support, I
am intrigued by imaginative plans
developed on other campuses.
The enclosed clipping which ap-}
peared on the education page of
the New York Times of March 19,
tells about one originated and or-|
ganized by a committee of the
Student Senate on the Colgate |
campus. i

According to an old Colgate
tradition, 13 is a lucky num-
ber. Last Friday students
began pushing that luck as
they launched a month-long

Undergraduate Scholarship

Endowment (USE) campaign.

The campaign committee is
urging each student on the

University’s Hamilton, N. Y.,

campus to raise a minimum

of $13 to support scholarship
funds, faculty salary increases
and research. Part of spring
vacaton will be devoted to
soliciting funds from relatives
and friends; parents and
alumni, however, are out of

bounds. 4

... Senior William Swezey.
chairman of the campaign,
said that “alumni, corpora-
tions, parents and foundations
are already helping Colgate
and other private colleges, It
is now time that we students
pitch in too.”

I wish to doff my fund-raising
hat to student leadership on a
neighboring campus. At the same
time, I wish, again, to acknowl-
edge with pride and gratitude the
important role played by our own
Bucknell students in the Dual
Development Fund campaign. .

Cordially yours,
Wesley N. Haines,
Director of Development

Today, foregoing levity, let us turn our keen young minds to the
No. 1 problem facing American colleges today: the population
explosion. Only last week four people exploded in Cleveland,
Ohio—one of them while carrying a plate of soup. In case you’re
thinking such a thing couldn’t happen anywhere but in Cleve-
land, let me tell you there were also two other cases last week —
a 45 year old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19 year old girl in
Bangor, Maine—and in addition there was a near-miss in
Klamath Falls, Oregon—an eight year old boy who was saved
only by the quick thinking of his cat Walter who pushed the
phone off the hook with his muzzle and dialled the department
of weights and measures. (It would perhaps have made more
sense for Walter to dial the fire department, but one can hardly
expect a cat to summon a fire engine which is followed by a
Dalmatian, can one?)

I bring up the population explosion not to alarm you, for I
feel certain that science will ultimately solve the problem. After
all, has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as
the transistor, the computer, the bevatron, and the Marlboro
filter? Oh, what a saga of science was the discovery of the
Mariboro filter! Oh, what a heart-rending epic of endless trial
and error, of dedication and perseverance! And, in the end, what
a triumph it was when the Marlboro scientists after years of
testing and discarding one filter material after another—iron,
nickel, lead, tin, antimony, sponge cake—finally emerged, tired
but happy, from their laboratory, carrying in their hands the
perfect filter cigarette! What rejoicing there was that day!
Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we light a Marlboro
and settle back and enjoy that full-flavored smoke which comes
to us in soft pack or flip-top box at tobacco counters in all
fifty states and Cleveland!

Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems rising out of the
population explosion, but in the meantime the problems hang
heavy over America’s colleges. This year will bring history’s
greatest rush of high school graduates. Where will we find class-
rooms and teachers for this gigantic new influx?

Well sir, some say the answer is to adopt the trimester system.
This system, now in use at many colleges, eliminates summer
vacations, has three semesters per annum instead of two, and
compresses a four year course into three years.

This is good, but is it good enough? Even under the trimester
system the student has occasional days off. Moreover his nights
are utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind of all-out attack
that is indicated?

I say no. I say desperate problems call for desperate reme-
dies. I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I say
we must do no less than go to school every single day of the
year.. But that is not all. I say we must go to school 24 hours
of every day!

The benefits of such a program are, of course, obvious. First
of all, the classroom shortage will immediately disappear be-
cause all the dormitories can be converted into classrooms.
Second, the teacher shortage will immediately disappear because
all the night watchmen can be put to work teaching calculus
and Middle English poetry. And finally, overcrowding will
immediately disappear because everyone will quit school.

Any further questions?

Plenty! Consider the problem. Western Elec-
tric manufactures the switching systems which

throughout the U. S. The average call over
today’s electromechanical system requires 420
relay operations. All together, this intercon-
necting equipment makes up the heart of what
is, in effect, the world’s largest machine.

That’s where Western Electric and you
come in. The switching equipment for this
“machine” involves an enormous manufactur-
ing job carried on by our plants throughout i
the country. Because of the size and service
requirements involved, we require quality
standards far exceeding those of ordinary
manufacturing. The size of this job presents
an unusual challenge to the engineer who may
save the Bell System many thousands of dollars
by even a small cost-reduction step.

While today’s switching calls for a priority
on engineering, tomorrow's will be even more
exciting. For even now the revolutionary Elec-

therefore, defunct.

Doves Nest Abroad

In a recent speech, President Kennedy appealed to
Americans to “ask not what your country will do for you,
but rather what you can do for your country.” As re-
sponse to this request, he received an energetic approval
of his Peace Corps program. In spite of all the fervor
raised by Americans, many people have little information
on what the Peace Corps actually is.

Officially the Corps is a “pool of trained American men
and women sent overseas by the U. S. Government or
through private organizations and institutions to help
foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled man-
power.” Unofficially, it is a new adventure designed to
win friends for the U. S. by approaching foreigners on a
personal, non-political basis, thus thwarting present cold-
war techniques.

Men and women, at least 18 years old, are eligible to
volunteer for the Peace Corps. Applicants need not be

‘college graduates, but should be people with trade skills
or some special job experience. Before they are selected,
applicants will bethoroughly interviewed, tested and re-
tested, and specifically trained to serve in a particular area
and in a particular capacity.

Members of the Peace Corps will not have an easy job.
This statement needs emphasis. Volunteers may find their
work tedious and full of frustration. Their living condi-
tions will probably be poor. They will have to learn to
cope with the deep distrust of the uninformed. Members
of the Peace Corps will receive no salary—only an allow-
ance which is sufficient to meet their basic needs and to
maintain their health. Furthermore, service with the
Corps will not exempt volunteers from Selective Service.

Despite any of the inherent drawbacks of the Peace
Corps, its potential worth seems to far outmeasure any
harm which may result. We have an “exciting genera-
tion” of Americans who are willing and capable to aid
their country and world. It seems only fair to-give these
people the training and opportunity to play their full part
in the world community.

Because of the facilities available at Bucknell and the
large number of foreign students enrolled, this University
has applied to become a training center for Peace Corps
volunteers. To foster interest and support in the Corps,
a conference is being planned by the Christian Associa-
tion. By adequately informing and educating the students
here, it is hoped that Bucknellians will take an affirmative
stand regarding this newest peace venture.

Monopol -In Spite Of

How many people realize that the Book Store has virtually a
monoply on its entire stock? Texts are sold to us at their list price
oer even above list price and tidy profits are being harvested by that|
little money-making enterprise on the hill. Most colleges give their |
students a discount on books and supplies. Yet, we are encumbered |
by immoderate prices on anything we buy. Is it not true that com- |
mercial stationary, beer mugs, | ners, sweat shirts, jackets, etc., are
usually si manufactur suggested retail |

alleged task to ins able profits for the Book Store. |

0 note the speed with which book|
orders are being fulfilled students did not receive texts for
their courses as late as mid-semester. What a wonderful state of
affairs; and how conducive it is to furthering our academic poten-
tialities! In the first place, why should the store have to order extra
books for a course? It should always be prepared to equip students
who have transferred into a class at the last minute. You may argue
that the Book Store might be overladen with extra volumes in certain
courses if they were to order a shipment of books in excess of their
demand. As far as we are concerned, it is better to stock a few extra
books than to create a situation in which students would tend to fall
behind in their work because they lack adequate texts. Also, un-
used books can be returned to the publisher for a refund.

How many of you have inquired about desired texts and have
been told that they could not be sold because they were in the base-
ment of the Book Store and had not yet been price-marked? The
clerks at the store courteously tell you to please try again in three
days or in a week because they are so busy that it would be impos-
sible for them to put a price tag on the book you want before that
time. Would it not be feasible to use some of the profit made by the
store in order to hire someone who would make sure that books are
available when they are requested?

In many respects, it seems almost as if the Book Store is thwart-
ing us. It’s obvious deficiencies have been enumerated several times

im the past. Yet, we are able to see no concerted effort to alleviate
these shortcomings.

LETTERS 10
THE EDITOR

April 10, 1961
Dear American Public,
Yes, Bucknellian, you are part
of the American Public... And I’m
sure that those of you who saw

migrant workers which was
shown on campus several times
during the past week, feel as I do

But you dismiss the
quickly because

thought
, well, it’s obvious

circles. You probably aren’t a
millionaire. And you certainly
aren’t Edward R. Murrow! So
why bother thinking about it?
Well, Bucknellian, you were
right. You should do something!

And, what’s more, you can. Aj
few ideas are running around in

my mind. Just think how many
more ideas—and how many good
ones we could come up with if we
worked together! We might

start by drafting a letter to Con- |

gress, from all of us (perhaps en-
dorsed by SFC, and maybe even
the entire Bucknell faculty). No,
one letter might not hit Washing-
ton like a tornado, but thousands
of letters would!

These might come from other

colleges to whom we could write, |

asking them to follow suit. After
all, Bucknellians, you are rep-
resented in Congress. Why
shouldn’t the migrant be repre-
sented? Just because he wasn’t
lucky enough to be born into your
family? We're just the ones who
can represent him!

I intend to bring the matter
before the Senate of WSGA on
Wednesday, April 19, as a kind
of jumping-off point. All I ask
you to do is give a little support
—a note in the mailbox, a word
in passing, a letter to the Buck-
nellian. Just let me know that,

you want to do something. That’s
all.
You see, Bucknellian, I agree
. .. One ant can’t move even a
pebble. But 2400 can start a
landslide.
Hopefully,

Literati Discuss |
‘Vital Question’

by James Reiser

Many recurring problems plague
the students of Bucknell Univer-
sity. Some of these issues are
semiannual in nature, that is, they
bloom twice a year—once at the
first semester registration, and
again at the second semester or-
deal. It is one such problem
which I wish to discuss now. i

Psychologists tell us that most
people love to harbor secrets. It
gives them a feeling of uniqueness
and sets them apart from their
unknowing neighbors. This fact
appears to be especially true of
Bucknell’ English department.
Why that mysterious’ group loves
oceultism so much that they don’t
even divulge the names of the
professors who are teaching par-
ticular English courses—namely, ;
the rehabilitating English 101-102
and that disseminator of literary |
wsdom—world literature. |

Not being one to shirk the re-|
sponsibilities of a good detective, |
I investigated this situation. By|
hiding in the closet in the room|
of the department secretary and!
by disguising myself as a book-
shelf in the department’s confer- |
ence room, I overheard some re- |
vealing conversations.

In addition to learning that In- |
structor Dillard was dating young |
male students and that Associate |
Professor (space) had never pass- |
ed his spelling test, I heard Chair- |
man Johnson utter the following:
“Ladies and gentlemen, oh! and)
you too,” as he nodded to an odd
looking creature sitting in the;
corner of the room, “I have called |
this special meeting in order to
make up stories so that we can|
deey the attack which the Buck- |
nellian fs going to launch on us
next week.” Altough I was stun- |
ned to learn that there was aj
traitor on our newspaper staff, I
listened as the Chairman con-|
tinued. “We must think of some |
reasons why we don’t tell stu-j
dents what professor they’ll get |
stuck wth.”

An old man f the rear of the
room raised: one finger, and the
Chairman, mistaking his sign for
enthusiasm, called upon him ‘to|
speak. “It is because some teach-
ers are capable and interesting |
whereas others are not. We do}
it becauise we must save face; af- |
ter all this is a democratic coun-
try and remember our motto:
‘Equality—twenty students per)
professor’ * He sat down.

“Pm sorry,’ the Chairman re-
torted. “That reason is too
plausible. From now on, please
limit your comments to those of}
an opposite nature or I'll make
you stand in the corner for being
naughty.”

So the meeting continued for
45 minutes while the committee
worked on a resolution which;
“answered” the Bucknellian’s |
query. Finally the Chairman rose
again. “We must,’ he stated,
“take an important vote on the
issue confronting us.” He paused
momentarily, then continued.
“Should members of our depart-
ben be allowed to accept the posi-
tion of ‘Hoagy Man’?”

Whereupon the history making
epoch terminteed.

HAPPINESS CAN’T BUY MONEY

With tuition costs spiralling ever upward, more and more under-
graduates are investigating the student loan plan. If you are
one who is considering the “Learn Now, Pay Later’ system, you
would do well first to study the case of Leonid Sigafoos.
Leonid, the son of an upholsterer in Straitened Circum-
stances, Idaho, had his heart set on going to college, but his
father, alas, could not afford to send him. Leonid applied for
a Regents Scholarship, but his reading’ speed, alas, w:
yid—two words an hour--and before he could finis
ro of his test the Regents had closed their bri

And then, huzzah, Leonid learned of the student loan plan:
he could borrow money for his tuition and repay it in e
monthly installments after he left school!

Happily Leonid enrolled in the Southeastern Idaho College
of Woodpulp and Restoration Drama and happily began a
college career that grew more happy year by year. Indeed, it
became altogether ecstatic in his senior year because Leonid met
2.coed named Salina T. Nem with hair like beaten gold and
eyes like two squirts of Lake Louise. Love gripped them in its
big moist palm and they were bet rothed on the Eve of St. Agnes.

Happily they made plans to be married the day after com-
mencement — s, alas, that never were to come to fruition
because Leonid, alas, learned that Salina, like himself, was in
college on a student loan, which meant that he had not only
to repay his own loan when he left school but also Salina’s, and
the job, alas, that was ting for Leonid after graduation at
the Boise Raccoon Works simply did not pay enough, alas, te
cover both their loans, plus rent and food and clothing.

Sick at heart, Leonid and Salina sat down and lit Marlbore
Cigarettes and tried to find an answer to their problem—and,
sure enough, they did! I do not know whether or not Marlbore
Cigarettes helped them find an answer; all I know is that
Marlboros taste good and look good, and when things close in
and a feller needs afriend and the world is black as the pit from
pole to pole, it is a heap of comfort and satisfaction to be sure
that Marlboros will always provide the same unflagging pleas-
ure, the same unstinting quality, in all times and climes and
conditions. That's all know.

Leonid and Salina, I say, did find an answer—a very simple
one. If their student loans did not come due until they left
school, why, then they just wouldn’t leave school! So after
receiving their bachelor degrees, they re-enrolled and took
masters degrees. After that they took doctors degrees, loads and
loads of them, until today Leonid and Salina, both aged 78, both
still in school, hold doctorates in Philosophy, Humane Letters,
Jurisprudence, Veterinary Medicine, Civil Engineering, Op-
tometry, and Dewey Decimals. Their student loans, as of last
January 1, amounted to a’ combined total of eighteen million
dollars, a sum which they probably would have found great
difficulty in repaying had not the Department of the Interior
recently declared them a National Park.

You don’t need a student loan—just a little loose change—
to grab yourself a new kind of smoking pleasure from the
makers of Marlboro—the unfiltered king-size Philip Morris
Commander. Welcome aboard!

uture up in the air?

As the communications needs of our nation
become steadily greater and more complex,
the Bell Telephone System is continuing its
pioneer work in microwave by “taking to the
air” more and more to get the word across.

To this end, Western Electric—the manu-
facturing arm of the Bell System—has the
monumental task of producing a large part of
the microwave transmission equipment that
knits our country together by shrinking thou-
sands of miles into mere seconds,

In spite of its great technological strides,
the science of radio relay is a rapidly-changing
one. And new break-throughs and advances
are common occurrences. A case in point: our
Bell System “TH” Microwave Radio Relay.
This newest development in long-distance
telephone transmission will eventually triple
the present message-carrying capacity of exist-
ing long-haul radio relay installations. A full-
cale system of 6 working and 2 protection
channels can handle 11,000 telephone mes-
sages at the same time.

To make microwave work takes a host of
special equipment and components: relay
towers, antennae, waveguides, traveling wave-
tubes, transistors, etc. But just as important,

it takes top-caliber people to help us broaden
our horizons into such exciting new areas as
communication by satellites!

And microwave is only part of Western
Electric's opportunity story. We have—right
now—hundreds of challenging and rewarding
positions in virtually all areas of telephony,
as well as in development and bu g of
defense communications and missile guidance
systems for the Government.

receive its broadcasts clearly? Last year, when the sta-
tion was relocated, there was talk about a new surge of
power for WVBU broadcasts. However, more powerful

transmitting equipment still remains as WVBU’s basic

necessity.

This one item, although stimulating WVBU, would fail
to cure its other ills. Being the student’s radio station,
WVBU should cater to the students’ interests. To do this,
radio programming obviously needs to be increasingly
varied. Many students are interested in music which
transcends rock and roll and jazz (especially the former).
This situation warrants an increased number of classical
programs. Concerts and lectures given on the campus
could be taped and broadcast. Thus, students who are
unable to attend or even those who are desirous of a re-
run could hear such events.

WVBU could be used effectively in the area of politics.
For example, candidates for various student organizations
could speak to outline their plans. This would enable
more of the student body to becme acquainted with them.
Sports events, especially away football and basketball
games could be broadcast when other local stations do not
carry these events. All university-scheduled activities
should be announced daily. Finally, interviews, debates,
and prograrns similar to the television “College Bowl”
would enable the students to be stimulated on an academ-
ic level.

Most of these changes would not increase the station’s
expenditures; the only need would be for more volunteers
so that WVBU could operate a revamped program sched-
ule effectively.

By adapting these revisions, we hope that WVBU will
emerge from its extended larval stage, and that the re-
sults of this metamorphosis will be desirable.

Four Percent Straw

A student revolt against the four percent State sales tax
on textbooks and school supplies is snowballing across
Pennsylvania’s 88 college and university campuses. The
drive has reached the proportions of a State-wide lobby-
ing campaign aimed at the Pennsylvania legislature.

Temple University is prodding its students to write to
their local newspapers, telephone their ward leaders, and
enlist the support of parents in bringing pressure to bear
on State legislators. We believe that SFC, the represen-
tative organ of student government here at Bucknell,
should sponsor a similar drive against this tax. The State
sales tax on textbooks and school supplies is an unneces-
sary financial burden on college students in a period when
tuition, room and board, and prices. of texts and other
supplies have been rapidly rising.

Although the tax bite on the individual student is small
—probably no more than an average of $4 a year—and
may not seem to be a heavy burden, neither was the
straw that broke the camel’s back! The average under-
graduate spends between $75 and $100 a year for text-
books and supplies. This outlay is compulsory since we
must buy books in order to remain in school. Today, ed-
ucation is a necessity. However, its price is too high for
many students, and the tax on texts aggravates the prob-
lem. Backers of the drive point out that the loss in state
revenue would be negligible—one estimate fixes the sum
at approximately $500,000.

Albeit the small additional $4 cost of texts may seem
incansequential to most of us, there are some students
who are required to work their way through school, and
they are the ones who bear the brunt of the unnecessary
tax levy. It is true that these students are in the minor-
ity. Yet, we are faced with a situation where the force
of the majority could provide enough impetus to succor
the cause of the minority.

So far, the campaign initiated by Temple University has
had little tangible success. Undergraduates have met with
apathy in the past in their lobbying because most students
are not of voting age, and for this reason have not been
able to sufficiently influence legislators. We hope that a
concerted push by Bucknell’s SFC (with student backing),
together with the student councils of other colleges will
bring favorable results in an effort to abolish this unnec-
essary State tax.

| Dear Bucknellians:

| As Joan Fetter: stressed in her
| letter to the editor last week, we
|should take action against the
|migrant labor problem. If we
| work together in a united effort,
we can do our part in alleviating
the problem. Just how is this to
\be accomplished? On the na-
tional level we can write letters
; to our Congressmen and Senators
jurging their support of the mi-
grant farm labor bills which have
\been introduced in both Houses.

On the local level we can give
| financial assistance for the educa-

tion of migrant children, paricu-
\larly those in Pennsylvania.
Working with Dr. Karraker, his-
tory professor and President of
the Pennsylvania Citizen's Com-
mittee on Migrant Labor, we can
| appropriate money to he summer
{schools for migrant children
| which have been set up in a num-
‘ber of Pennsylvania counties, in-
;cuding Northumberland County
| (mear Sunbury).

Interest in migrant workers is
{nothing new at Bucknell, but we
intend to strengthen the organiz-
ation and thereby the support of
our efforts. Four years ago a
student committee was formed to
raise money for the education of
Wilhelmina Rice, a migrant work-
er’s daughter at Upsala College.
This has been continued yearly
jand will enable her to graduate
this June.

In addition, this year WSGA
gave $300 for the care and educa-
tion of migrant children and col-
lections of toys haye been made
jfor these needy children.

This is all fine and well, but it
tis only a beginning. We are

bit by?
jyou want to go there for? Sel-
|dom have I had the time in casual

Now the time has come to tell
‘of some of these experiences such
|as how we, a small group of col-
jlege age girls and fellows, work-
jed side by side with Africans for
jlong hours every day, digging
|foundations and making bricks to

{we danced at a huge State Ball,
icelebrating the independence of
ja new African nation; how we
{held our breath while eating hot
| African food, or sighed a sigh of

our mahogany-board beds.

More than these accounts of
jaction I remember the intangible
experiences that in our daily liv-
ing with our African friends help-
ed dispel their suspicions that all
Americans hate black people, that
every American city is a Little
Rock, that college students,’ or
Americans in general, can not do
manual labor (because we have
machines to do everything), and
that America is not interested in
helping Africans strive for inde-
pendence.

Bucknell what we want it to be:

THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN

Now in the waning days of the school year when the hardest
heart grows mellow and the very air is charged with memories,
let us pause for a moment and pay tribute to that overworked
and underappreciated campus figure, your friend and mine, the
dean of students. .

Policeman and confessor, shepherd and seer, warden and
oracle, proconsul and pal, the dean of students is by far the
most enigmatic of all academici How can we understand
him? Well sir, perhaps the best way is to take an average day
in the life of an average dean. Here, for example, is what hap-
pened last Thursday to Dean Killjoy N. Damper of Duluth
Aand M.

At 6 a.m. he woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up on
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the Founder which
had been placed there during the night by high-spirited under-
graduates.

m. he lita Marlboro and walked briskly to the campus.

on the roof of the firls dormitory by high-spirited under-
graduates.)

At 7:45 am. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro, and
elimbed the bell tower to remove his secretary who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.

At 8 a.m. he reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with
Derther Sigafoos, editor of the student newspaper. Young
Sigafoos had been writing a series of editorials urging the
United States to anne da. When his editorials had evoked
no response, h¢ had taken matters into his own hands. Accom-
panied by his sports editor and two copy readers, he had gone
over the border and conquered Manitoba. With great patience
and several excellent Marlboro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Sigafoos to give Manitoba back. Young Sigafoos, how-
ever, insisted on keeping Winnipeg...

At 9 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with Erwin J.
Bender, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who came to
report that the Deke house had been put on top of the Sigma
Chi house during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.

At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire an
intramural softball game on the roof of the law school where the
campus baseball diamond had been placed during the night by
high-spirited undergraduates.

‘At 12 noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the presi-
dent of the university, the bursar, the registrar, and the chair-
man of the English department at the bottom of the campus
swimming pool where the faculty dining room had been placed
during the night by high-spirited undergraduates. Mariboros
were passed after lunch, but not lit owing to the dampness.

At 2 p.m., back in his office, the Dean lit a Marlboro and
received the Canadian minister of war who said that unless
young Sigafoos gave back Winnipeg, Canada would march.
Young Sigafoos was summoned and agreed to give back Winni-
peg if he could have Saskatoon. The Canadian minister of war
at first refused, but finally agreed after young Sigafoos placed
him on the roof of the mining and metallurgy building.

At 3 p.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with a delegation
from the student council who came to present him with a set
of matched luggage in honor of his fifty years’ service as dean
of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage with his
elothing and Marlboros and fled to Utica, New York, where he

is now in the aluminum siding game. © 1961 Max Shulman

To the dean of students and all you other hard-working
academic types, here’s the new word in smoking pleasure
from the makers of Marlboro—king-size unfiltered Philip
Morris Commander. Welcome aboard!

Goodbye To Winter

Following the long winded demise of the winter sports’ season
come fairer days and “green fields.” The baskets have been rolled
into dark corners, the mats have been rolled up, and the pool drained,
and a young man’s fancy turns to—baseball. With the advent of the
national pastime also appears a deluge of spikes, sweatshirts, and
shotputs, as the most materially unrewarding sport of them all—track
—-begins to jog the cinder ovals.

Accompanying the “demise” of winter sports is a noticeable loss
in interest in the Bucknell athletics. Reams of material have been
published about the plight of college basebail and its weak role in the
annals of American sport. But at the risk of putting my neck upon
the proverbial chopping block with an idealistic, but unqualified,
essay, which seems to be so characteristic of this printed medium,
the case concerning Bucknell baseball and spring sports in general
must be stated.

The Attendance Problem

Each April the interest in athletics takes a decided downfall, as
evidenced by the number (small) of spectators at nearly every event,
until most intramural contests draw larger crowds than varsity com-
petition. Attendance at track, golf, and tennis meets is practically
non-existent, and the largest crowd at a baseball game is Mother’s
Weekend.

The problem of Spring sports and attendance there at is not to be
remedied by a generalizing expose of University deficiencies or by
coercive mass movement to the ball field by “Fans”. Obviously a
school the size of Bucknell cannot be handing out scholarships to
every potentially good athlete. But in deference to the athletes who
now compete for BU in the Spring, the answer is naturally one of
‘personnel and material. How to procure this material is purely ad-
ministrative. Realizing that the administration is engaged in back-|
ing scholastic rather than athletic improvement, a more than condon- |
able position, it should be realized that good athletic material often |
attracts good scholastic material.

Something Should Be Done

Each source of material can benefit Bucknell greatly, but this is|
not an essay based on fault-finding, but rather an analysis of the rec- |
ord book. Rather, it is enough to say that some effort, not neces- |
sarily financial assistance, should be made in the direction of improv-
ing Spring sports to the level enjoyed by the fall and winter teams
or the long run results could be conceivably detrimental.

ae.

Perhaps some of the blame for poor attendance falls upon this
page. However, every schedule is printed at one time or another,
often duplicated in a later issue, and most events are given a small
preview, but if no one read the sports section and Spring teams were
on a higher than present caliber, there would be fans. The thought
that the.so-called “apathy,” said to be currently afflicting the student
body, ranges into the world of sport is too awful to comprehend.

The Luck of the Draw

A possible method of gatherin;
good athletes could be one of re-
cruiting through persuasion and
providing a knowledge of Buck-
nell. Some limited help could be
suggested, but an accent could
also be on the “opportunity to
play ball” factor and the “build-
ing process.” Using  a“snowjob”
routine might pay off in the at-
traction of very good men to the
school. At least the success of
Spring sports should not be de-
termined by the luck of the draw.

If Bucknell is to maintain high
standards scholastically, and there
is every indication that it intends
to do so, and athletically each fall
and winter, then why not in the

Spring also? This Spring, especi-
ally, Bison teams need support
from the students for even one
team to win more than it loses.

* ¢ * *

As if the problem of insufficient
material were not enough, the].
poor attitude of the material at
hand is doubly serious. Last week
the Intramural track meet attract-
ed more fans than all the varsity
meets combined, and while some
of the “Fraternal Athletes” could
help Bucknell on the cinders, they
are not the real offenders.

The track team went to Lafay-
ette without five of their best
men. A co-captain is no longer
with the team. Several letter-
men now have their sweaters and
so have “retired” to rest on their
laurels. There’s not much dedi-
cation in that crowd.

The above situation leaves
clouds of speculation, but not a
very good solution. But some-
thing should be done about this
condition or there won’t be a track
team. And what’s worse yet is,
that after it’s gone, will anyone
care?

O'D Searches for 0B

by Ted Odenwald

In two weeks, Coach Bob Odell
has proved that he plans to con-
duct many experiments with his
grid stars. Three of the quarter-
backs whom he listed as possible
starters next season have been
switched to other backfield posi-
tions, while a fourth player was
considered as a possible replace-
ment for Little All-American
Paul Terhes.

Listed at the beginning of the
season as quarterbacks, Norm
Garrity, Jim West, and Tom Rich-
ards have been switched to posi-
tions where “they can do more
for the team.” In Garrity, Coach
Odell feels he has “one of the

finest defensive backs we've had.” !
If Garrity could play at quarter- |
back next season, he would be}

used sparingly, because “his
throwing is only ordinary.” “Jim
West,” claims Odell, “is another
excellent defensive back. We'll
use him for more defensive
depth.” Freshman Tom Rich-
ards, termed as a “tough guy”
was switched over to the fullback
position where he has been doing
a tremendous job.

Pat Malone, who came to Buck-
nell as a quarterback but was
switched to halfback because of

the Bisons’ Terhes and Elliot, will:

be given another shot at the all-
important position.

“If we had to play a game right
now,” said Coach Odell, “Doug
Williams would be our starting
quarterback. He has more ex-
perience than any of the other
fellows.”

Golfers Win

The Bucknell golf team finally
got a chance to play on their rain-
soaked home course last Saturday
and defeated Colgate 4-3 in a
non-MAC match. The Bisons,
unable to get recent preparation
for the meet because of the bad
weather, got good performances
from Bob Schad, Curt Mull, Jerry
Singer, and sophomore Don Moth-
ner, in winning their first test this
season. Former Middle Atlantic
champion Bob Etzweiler, co-cap-
tain of the Bucknell team found
rough competition in the first spot
and lost 2 and 1.

Schad, who last year had a 68
here the same day Etzweiler had
a 69 against G-Burg, played in the
number two position and beat his
opponent on the 16th hole, 3 and

2. Curt Mull was low man for)

the Bisons, carding a 75 and win-
ning handily, 6 and 5. Pete Sang,
a junior, playing in the fourth
position, lost’on the last hole, 1
up. Jerry Singer won 2 and 1,
Ted Casey, a soph, was defeated
6 and 5, while first year man Don
Mothner won 2 and 1.

To Odell, Don Rodgers is the
best playing freshman. “He
throws very well,” claimed the
coach, “and his biggest drawback
is his lack of experience.”

Ron Giordano has particularly
impressed the coaching staff with
his determination. “He’s the kind
of guy who gets the job done.”

The number of quarterbacks is
now down to six, but the starting
player for next season still re-
mains unknown. '

OWLS, LAFAYETTE
TRIM TRACK TEAM |

| ‘The Bucknell track team lost its
first two encounters on the cinder
pathways by the lopsided scores
of 95-38% to Temple and 103-28
to Lafayette during the past week.
Last Saturday in Philadelphia the
Bisons could manage only one
first place as Art Lemkau took
the javelin, while Dick Boddie
managed a tie for the top spot in
the high jump. Bucknell could
capture only six second places as
Boddie was runner-up‘in the 220
low hurdles, Ron Andreuzzi was
second in the broad jump, Art
Michaelis second in the discus,
Bob DeCamp in the 880, Buzzy
Holmes in the 440, and Ray
Keeney in the pole vault.

Tuesday the Bison cindermen
traveled to Easton, Pa, where
they were walloped by Lafayette
by a margin of 75 points. Dick
Boddie was a one-man show as he
took three firsts, the only top
honors Bucknell collected all af-
ternoon on the soggy track. Bod-
die won the 120 high hurdles, the
220 low hurdles, and high jump
with a leap of 5’ 10”. Buzzy
Holmes took a second in the 100
yard dash, run at a slow 104.
Bob DeCamp finished second in
the 880 as did Jeff Martin in the
two mile run.

The track team will run for the
first time this season in Memorial
Stadium this Saturday at 2 p. m.
when they participate in a tri-
meet with Delaware and Muhlen-
burg.

Is your future up in the air?

As the communications needs of our nation
become steadily greater and more complex,
the Bell Telephone System is continuing its
pioneer work in microwave by “taking to the
air” more and more to get the word across.

To this end, Western Electric—the manu-
facturing arm of the Bell System—has the
monumental task of producing a large part of
the mictowave transmission equipment that
knits our country together by shrinking thou-
sands of miles into mere seconds..

In spite of its great technological strides,
the science of radio relay is a rapidly-changing

as well as in

one. And new break-throughs and advances

are common occurrences. A case in point: our
Bell System “TH” Microwave Radio Relay.
This newest development in long-distance
telephone transmission will eventually triple
the present message-carrying capacity of exist-
ing long-haul radio relay installations. A full-
scale system of 6 working and 2 protection
channels can handle 11,000 telephone mes-

sages at the same time.

To make microwave work takes a host of
special equipment and components: relay
towers, antennae, waveguides, traveling wave-

tubes, transistors, etc. But just as important,

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY

it takes top-caliber people to help us broaden
our horizons into such exciting new areas as
communication by satellites!

And microwave is only part of Western
Electric's opportunity story. We have—right
now—hundreds of challenging and rewarding
positions in virtually all areas of telephony,

development and building of

defense communications and missile guidance
systems for the Government.

So, if your future is “up in the air,” you owe
it to your career to see “what’s up” for you at
Western Electric.

Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus-
trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. For more

Here’s one filter cigarette that’s really different!

The difference is this: Tareyton’s Dual Filter gives you a
unique inner filter of ACTIVATED CHARCOAL, definitely proved to
make the taste of a cigarette mild and smooth. It works together with

interesting, since Haitink began

himself, says, “I was not a very

then, he has risen from one of

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

At the Movies

by Joel Flegler

There simply exists no com-
parison between the comedies I
am reviewing this week and those
I criticized in last week’s column.
I ean only say that it seems im-
possible that in less than a week,
two truly outstanding examples
of comedy have been shown at
Bucknell. Of course I am refer-
ring to the Campus’ School for
Scoundrels and Hilltop’s The Con-
fession of Felix Krull.

The memory of the College of
Lifemanship will linger for quite
gore time in the minds of those
of us who felt a comradeship to-
wards Henry Pulfrey and his
plight. Because there’s a little
bit of all of us in Pulfrey (the
first Pulfrey, I mean), his success
in outwitting his dumbfounded
opponent and winning the girl he
loves is enjoyable to watch—in-
credible as it might actually be.

Ian Carmichael, as the con-
scientious student from a “col-
lege” that offers a most distine-
tive curriculum, and Terry-
Thomas, as the villain whose
confidence and conceit are com-
pletely shaken, once more show
their versatility. It is simply
pure pleasure to watch them act.
If Carmichael is the successor of
Alec Guiness, let us hope that he
continues making more films,
like this one, that are the equal
of those wonderful pictures that
Guiness unfortunately stopped
doing several years ago. I don’t
believe, as some do, that Sellers
is the answer, and Carmichael has
already proven that he can do it.

In short, this is the best British
comedy that I have seen since
Adventures of Sadie. |

After my enthusiasm for School |
for Scoundrels, I hardly know
what to say. about the 1957 Ger-|
man film that “brought down the
house” at Hilltop two weeks ago.
Some may not consider a movie
tke The Confessions of Felix!
Krull as “art,” but such intellect-
ual snobbery is dispelled by just}
viewing the scene in which Krull, |
at his “physical” for the German
army, tricks the Medical Board,;
surely one of the masterpieces of

|

comedy in contemporary motion
pictures.
Credit for much of the film’s|

Horst Buchholz, who, some may}
remember, as a young gunman,
helped make The Magnificent,
Seven a better “Western” than
most. Here, as Krull, he gives|
the character an honesty and
special type of naivete that go aj
long way into making him such a
likeable rogue. Kurt Hoffman
must also be applauded for his
masterful direction; rarely does}
one see cutting and editing used
with such smoothness and variety.

When the lights came on at the
end of almost two hours, there
were few in the audience who |
would not have wished that it had
lasted another two hours.

DU Play Hailed
As Big Success

The DU’s outdid themselves
with this year’s rendition of their
annual Demie play. Spine-ting-
ling Murder .in Rehearsal consist-
ed of a rather stupid, blusterous
sheriff's attempts to locate the
person responsible for a real
death from a shooting scene in a
play. Everyone was suspected;
everyone had a possible motive.
The triangle of the play in re-
hearsal was quite real. Both John
Werner and Dave Myler hoped to
wiin Chrisi Pechin’s lovely hand.
Tt seems that the maid, played by
Gary Hill, and her juvenile-de-
Yinquent brother, Dave Ackroyd,
hated him, Bob Matalucci quar-
relled with him, and even the
sheriff had reason to kill him!

Rather than proceed systemati-
cally to disclosure of the killer,
the plot thickened. The body
disappeared, and more people
kept entering the picture to com-
plicate matters—two aspiring, but
presently unsuccessful actresses,
and the gangling town simpleton,
hilariously portrayed by Bill
Keech. The solution comes after
numerous interruptions, buffon-
ery, and ad-libbing that are all
pert of the game. It’s quite a

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA. .

Delta Zeta’s Sophomore Rush

Blaze Bravery

On behalf of Bucknell student body, we would like to
commend the Lewisburg Fire Department for the highly
efficient job they did in controlling the fire which devas-
tated the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity House last week.
In the face of roaring flames and billowing smoke, the
Lewisburg firemen bravely attacked the blaze and pre-
vented it from endangering more lives and wreaking
havoc on more houses in the area.

Several members of SPE were trapped on the roof of
their burning house and were rescued from their precari-
ous predicament only by the prompt action of the firemen.
Only those who witnessed the terror and destruction
caused by the fire could fully appreciate the danger that
the Lewisburg firemen so unflinchingly faced. Gentle-
men, we take our hats off to you!

We would like, also, to acclaim the Bucknell students
who were present at the catastrophe for their willing as-
sistance too the firemen. Several students helped to carry
hoses and ladders. thus enabling more firemen to combat
the spreading blaze. In addition, students helped to trans-
port the members of SPE to temporary accommodations
in East College, and provided aid to those men who suf-
fered from the effects of the smoke and the stifling heat.

The IFC has taken immediate initiative to sponsor a
clothing drive for the members of SPE who were left des-
titute by the conflagration. Since the majority of the
students who lived in the house lost all their possessions
in the fire, the rest of us at Bucknell will be heavily re-
lied upon to further contribute our assistance in helping
these people to get back on their feet.

Because of this tragedy, the student body is presented
with a chance to work side by side in aiding these unfor-
tunate victims of the fire. We know that we can count on
your support!

Hats Off!

When approximately 2,000 people came to Davis Gym-
nasium last week, they not only heard a great orchestra
perform but were present at the finale of this year’s Artist
Series, perhaps the most rewarding of those ever had at
Bucknell. It would be a safe assumption to say that near-
ly all those who heard them were impressed by Van Cli-
burn’s sensitive piano technique, the Festival Quartet’s
intimate playing, and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Or-
chestra’s brilliant executions. The less said about the
Solov Ballet the better.

While the size of the audiences at the concerts this year
have been anything but spectacular (with the exception
of Cliburn’s), attendance has decidedly improved over the
past few years. Unfortunately, there is still a consider-
able percentage of students who are not desirous of taking
advantage of these rare opportunities. These students are
not only denying themselves the possibilities of being
deeply stimulated, but they are actually paying for some-
thing of which they do not partake. Some might think
that the latter is unjust, but since a university’s aim
should be to educate its students as best it can, supplying
them with the finest in art is one way to help accomplish
this goal,

One cannot imagine that the fulfillment of this aspect
of the goal could be in more capable hands than Lindsey
Merill’s, the man in charge of the Artist Series. Much to
his credit, Mr. Merrill has not compromised his tastes
with those of the general level of cultural interest (or,
rather, disinterest) of the majority of students on this
campus; instead he has sought to bring to Bucknell only
the highest quality, and has well succeeded in doing so.
‘One look at next year’s program shows that he seems
quite set upon outdoing ‘himself again, with such artists

About That Cold! ... from the Syracuse Daily Orange: I’d like
to tell you about this cold Ihad. It was really a pretty terrible cold, |
you might say, because I thought it was going to last forever. It did |
finally go away, however, which encourages me to go on.

It all started sometime last November when I started to cough
and sneeze. Shortly after I caught the cold, I read this magazine
article that told how most colds are actually psychosomatic—caused
by some mental problem instead of really catching a bug. And I
began to wonder what was causing this one.

I had been running around in the rain without a jacket on, but I
couldn’t figure what that could symbolize and I began to wonder if
it went back to some childhood experience.

Then my cold got worse: I spent-a weekend in this mountain
cabin without a fireplace, and when I got back I had a really sore
throat and a hacking cough. I figured the imagery that is generally
associated with spending a weekend in the woods must somehow
have caused an undesirable mental association.

Just when I thought I had the cold psychoanalyzed, it got that)
much worse. I decided there must be some serious mental conflict
going on in my subconscious—you know, below the level of reason.
Maybe I was insecure or had an-inferiority complex. I wondered if I
was punishing myself for catching a cold in the first place. ‘

I was hesitant to ask my friends about it, but they assured me!
that being mentally sick was just the same as being physically ill. |
One of my friends who is very secure said that most people will tell |
you about the time they had whooping cough or tonsillitis, but he |
told people all the time about when he had paranoia and manic de-

pression. . \

I was just trying to figure out whether there was any connection
between my cough and the fact that I was once knocked unconscious ;
by an icicle, when another friend who is very stupid and doesn’t;
read much suggested that I go to the infirmary.

“Take one of these each hour and get plenty of rest,” he said; I
followed his advice. And then the, funiest thing happened. Just like
that my cold disappeared.

Only trouble is, I can’t figure out what the pills symbolized psy-
chologically, Undoubtedly something deeply. buried in my past.
One of the pills was white and looked like an aspirin, and probably
doesn’t symbolize much of anything. It’s the other pill that disturbs
me. It was vaguely like the color of a rose.

Dorm Policy —

(c) Inasmuch as a_, certain
amount of surface technique
and politics is involved neces-
sarily in the business of rush,
open dorms would provide more
opportunities for freshman
women to view and understand
rush from the sorority point of
view, and would enable them
to make a more realistic decis-
ion as to whether or not they
wish to become a part of this
system.
Better Conditions
II. Deferred Rush would provide
more desirable conditions and op-
portunities for all those partici-
pating.
(a) Deferred rush would allow
freshman women two semesters
to adjust academically and to
make their grades.
(b) Deferred rush would pro-
vide us with a more reasonable
length of time to establish
closer acquaintances with a
greater number of women.
(c) Deferred rush would enable
freshmen to view their chances
with certain groups more real-
istically and would eliminate
such needless disappointment.
(d) Since many close freshman
groups are split up necessarily
by the housing procedures, the
sophomores would make their
sorority choices more individ-
ually without the pressures
exerted by many freshman hall
groups to join a particular sor-
ority or just any sorority at all
lil. Deferred Rush would help
to strengthen sororities on the
Bucknell campus.
(a) Under the present system,
sorurities devote the major por-
tion of their time and energies
to rushing in the first semester
and to orientation of pledges
during the second semester.
With deferred rush, sororities
could denote more time to more
worthwhile and meaningful
functions—social, cultural, phi-
lanthropic, etc.

(b) With deferred rush sorori-
ties would not need to (and for
that matter, could not) rush
throughout a whole year at the
same intensity that is maintain-
ed for one semester.
(c) Since open dorms and de-
ferred rush would provide
rushees with better opportuni-
ties for making realistic soror-
ity decisions, sororities would
benefit by pledging more con-
genial groups who would be
genuinely enthusiastic about
sorority life.
(d) Deferred rush and open
dorms would eliminate the
sophomore disenchantment and
would cut down on deactiva-
tions.
Objectives Answered
In addition to these arguments
for the proposal, we have tried
to anticipate some of the more
valid arguments against this pro-
posal and to these we present
counter-arguments:
1. During the period of transi-
tion, nationals and perhaps
some local chapters may com-
plain about the lag of mem-
bers and money. Remember,
we will experience this lag
for only one semester, and
even at that we will not lose
any class. Also, we can fill
our quotas (if we so desire)
with pick-ups from the three
upper classes during this
period of transition.
Many more women may de-
cide to go independent when
they find they have already
managed very nicely on their
own. Most of these women
would not make good sorority
women anyhow and would
probably dampen sorority en-
thusiasm and’ self-confidence
if they had joined in their
freshman year, thinking it
was the thing to do.

A ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME

As Commencement Day draws near, the question on everyone’s
lips is: ‘How did the different disciplines come to be marked by
academic robes with hoods of different colors?” Everybody —
but everybody —is asking it. I mean I haven’t been able to walk
ten feet on any campus in America without somebody grabs my
elbow and s, “How did the different disciplines come to be
marked by demic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?”’

This, I must say, is not the usual question asked by collegians
who grab my elbow. Usually they say, “Hey, Shorty, got a
Marlboro?” And this is right and proper. After all, are they not
collegians, and, therefore, the nation’s leaders in intelligence
and discernment? And do not intelligence and discernment de-
mand the tastiest in tobacco flavor and smoking pleasure? And
does not Marlboro deliver a flavor that is uniquely mellow, a
selectrate filter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, a box
that is hard? You know it!

lat Ws iedes eat ee tee Got

But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.

A doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears

reen, u master of arts wears wh
ison, a master of libr:

>, 2 doctor of humanities wears
s lemon yellow. Why?

exing question, we must go back to
March 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the
United States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos’s neighbors were of course wildly grateful—ail, that
is, except Wrex Todhunter.

Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both
men had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had
chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
Sigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise
Mambo, the Shay’s Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.
Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at alti
owing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.
(He was struck by a falling praline.)

Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos’s
library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.
This he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr-
Sigafoos. ‘‘What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven’t got?’ Mr.
Todhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came te
him: books. ;

So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books
and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
But Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There-
upon, Mr. Todhunter, not to he outdone, began serving tea
with sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with
sugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving
tea with sugar and cream and lemon.

This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be-
cause he had the only lemon tree in town—in fact, in the entire
state of North Dakota~and since that day lemon yellow has of
course been the color on the academic robes of library science,

(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library
and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There

-were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,

alas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced
to California until 1931 by John Wayne.) © 1961 Max Shulman

In the past week the Bison golt|
squad won two of three meets |
while the track squad placed)
second in a three team meet. |

The golf team dropped a 4-3;
decision Saturday to a strong)
Navy squad. ‘The winner of each,
inividual match was determined |
by the number of holes won. Bob |
Schad, the Bison’s number one,
man, was eliminated on the 14th,
hole by Midshipman Bill Cattlet.
Bucknellian Bob Etzweiler had
the closest match of the afternoon
as he finished all 18 holes with a
stroke lead. Pete Sang and Don
Mothner each won, victories for
the Bucknell cause, eliminating
their opponents on the 16th and
15th holes, respectively.

Navy golfers Tom Haney, Mike
Moore, and Walt Martin defeated
their respective Bison opponents,
Curt Mull, Jerry Singer, and Ted
Casey.

New Scoring Method

The next two Bison matches
were scored differently. The in-
dividual leading after the first
nine holes received one point as
did the individual who had the
lowest score for the second 18.
The winner also received one ex-
tra point.

The Bisons easily defeated Del-
aware 134-414 in an MAC match.
Bob Schad, Bob Etzweiler, Jerry

each earned a win. Only Mull
failed to score a win. Schad had |

* The Ordeal

If it’s true that baseball coaches and managers live and die with
every pitch that’s thrown, then Bucknell mentor Rod Oberlin has

| probably carried himself to a mental graveyard more times than one

man deserves. While inwardly hoping that Oberlin doesn’t have to
hold his breath each time his representative on the mound delivers
the “goods,” the average spectator should have some-idea of Rod’s
ordeal after analyzing the following statistics.

In four games this spring season the baseball team has bobbled
the ball 23 times. In contrast they have collected only 25 hits, 20
divided among four players, and have scored 15 runs. Fourteen of
those runs were earned. Here comes the part that must give Oberlin
gray hairs.

Gray-Hairsville

The opposition has crossed home plate exactly 35 times in the
four contests. Thanks to the “Terrible-Twenty-Three” the enemy
has been able to score 22 of those 35 tallies with the assistance of the
Bisons. They (the opposition) have earned but 13 of the runs against
They’ve banged out 39 hits, however,
and have made only four bungles on the field. While realizing that

| overall experience is not at a premium in the interests of pride and
| Mr. Oberlin’s health there is obviously only one method by which

each Bison baseball game can be prevented from becoming a heart-
rending “Comedy of Errors”.

Football's Not Carefree

Coach Oberlin may have his problems on the diamond, but Coach
Bob Odell is not entirely free from worry or care himself. He is still
sounding the depth of talent at his disposal for a “replacement” for
Paul Terhes at quarterback, as indicated in last week’s somewhat
poetically but illegibly titled story, “OD Searches for QB”. The is-
sue will probably not be solved until next fall. In the meantime
Odell has the trouble of getting enough football players together to
hold a practice.

KASNICK HURT
BY GROUNDER

The baseball team suffered a
ereivous loss last Friday when a
bad hop by the first ground ball
of the game with Lafayette deck-
ed third baseman Mike Kasnick
indefinitely. On the first play of
the game Kasnick knelt to field a
routine grounder off the infield
grass and was struck in the eye
when a crazy hop got away from
him. Kasnick, who wears con-
tact lenses, mode one gesture to
his eye before collapsing in pain.

The Lafayette trainer rushed
onto the field, where he removed
the lense from Mike’s eye, with an
instrument in his medical kit.
Fortunately,’ when the ball struck
Kasnick the small corneal lense
was pushed downward instead of
breaking. Shortly after the re-
moval of the lense Kasnick’s eye
was swollen shut.

‘Well, If the Bell Don’t Make, Bump Once;
Pennsylvania Dutchman’s Words Misunderstood

by Lois Everett

The hind-end-foremost type of
fractured Pennsylvania Dutch-|
English, invented in the past}
decade or two by bric-a-brac}
manufacturers to make what they |
call “Amish stuff” more palatable ;
to ‘the tourist buying public, has,
developed into a type of humor
enjoyed by everyone, including
the Pennsylvania Dutch. Perhaps
the classic example of it is found
in a story about a huckster driv-
ing through the streets of Allen-
town with his wife, selling pro-
duce.’ As they stopped in front

of a house, the woman alighted|he may add a heavy Dutch ac-|sense of the word; grex, meaning

a few minutes’ wait, the man said,
“Did you bell?” To which the
woman replied,
but it didn’t make.”
irritated farmer retorted, “Well|
now, if the bell don’t make, bump
once.”
Pa. Dutch Distorted

There are many more stories |
like this one, but these widely
publicized examples are a distor-
tion ofthe actual Pennsylvania- |
Dutch speech and they should be;
taken as such instead of being}
confused with either the Pennsyl-
vania Dutch dialect or with the
Pennsylvania Dutch-English. I}
should like to believe that the
Pennsylvania-Dutch were capable}
of murdering the English lan-|
guage with such verve and style,
but it takes a city slicker to swal- |}
low sentences like these. |

I’ve lived the majority of my

lifetime in and around the heart) =

of the Pennsylvania-Dutch area, |
and it wasn’t until I moved to
New Jersey for a few years and]
then finally came to college that|
I discovered there were several}
words in my vocabulary which}
were full of meaning to me, but |
which meant absolutely nothing |
to people from other states with
whom I was conversing. Ever
since then I’ve made a point of}
finding out all I tould about the|
phrases and words I'd used with-!
2 second thought in my every-
I'd like to clear up}
about the Pennsyl-j
language and point}
out that there is humor in;
Dutch-English exp: on that is}
quite wholesome and doesn’t real- !
ly have to be distorted to the}
point that it gives the impression |
that Pennsylvania-Dutch people!
a ignorant.

Get out from under the avalanche;
don't put off your career ptanning
‘til graduation time.

Pennsylvania Dutch is a dialect; slightly with the intonation the

which was brought to Pennsyl-
vania from the Palatinate between
1683 and the time of the Revolu-
tionary War. It is a dignified
language, not a degenerate form
of German as some poorly inform-
ed people think, and has been the
cradle tongue of millions of
Americans—including the Hoov-
ers and the Eisenhowers—from
Colonial times to the present.
However, when the Dutchman
tries to express himself in Eng-
lish quickly, or when he literally
translates his dialect into English,

loan-words to his English conver-
sation. It is this aspect of their

“Sure I belled, speech that has been distorted | peep, meaning a hen and her

purpose.
Common Expressions

Some quaint expressions heard
in the Dutch country are as fol-
lows: “The paper wants rain,”
“The butter won’t reach,” “The
bread is all,” “Reach me the meat
over,” “The picture didn’t get,”
“Outen the lights.” These ex-
pressions are sO common as to
cause only a flicker of amuse-
ment, but if you think about
them, they’re rather amusing.

The most interesting aspect of
this Dutch-English speech can be
heard when a_ Pennsylvania-
Dutchman speak,ng in his rural
English, occasionally includes one
or several odd words that seem-
ingly have no orthodox origin.
The spelling of these words varies

individual persons cares to give
them, and I haven’t been able to
find them even in a slang diction-
ary; yet everyone who has had
contact with them has no difficul-
ty in understanding the written
or pronounced variations. They
j;are words such as:

Spritz, meaning squirt or splash
someone with water; strubbly,
meaning disheveled, as strubbly
\hair; dobbich, meaning clumsy;
lrutsch or rootch, meaning to

or Christmas crib and the rest of
|the manger scene placed under
the Christmas tree.
Dutchman Spritzes Grass

Thus to the amusement of the
visitor, when the Dutchman
waters his lawn he “spritzes” the
grass; when he gets up in the
morning and looks at his hair in
the mirror he says it looks aw-
fully “strubbly”; if his child does
not sit still he tells him to stop
“rootching”; when the potato bin

is empty the Dutch housewife an-}

the light he is likely to tell you
to “outen” it; and if his children
talk at the table with food in
their mouth he admonishes them,
“Eat your mouth empty, before
you say something, once!”

Also during his conversation
the Dutchman may use several
expressive interpections of which
“Ach, “Ei! ei,” and “Ei-yi, yi!”
are the most important. As the
rest of the examples given, these
interjections lose most of their
vigor in print, especially for those
people who have never, heard
them in the context of a sentence
and accompanied with facial ex-
pressions and hand movements |
which give them true quality of
meaning. Most assuredly these
words and phrases would be |
frowned on by scholars and peda- |
gogues; but some of them, when
used in conversation in a com-
munity where they are under-
stood, find their usage justified— |
especially when to all intents and
purposes they express so much
better than English what the |
speaker who understands them
has in mind. ‘For me several of
these words have more depth of
meaning than their English coun-

| terparts, even though I wouldn’t

care to try them out on an Eng-
lish professor. He would prob-
ably be grexy about it, and think
my English was dobbich and
strubbly.

Two values on which the,
strength of the Bucknell of To-}
morrow rests, are alumni loyalty
and the support of friends. i

Wednesday: April 19—10:15 p. m.

Three anonymous sem-gems,
dressed in khaki trench-coats,
were seen leaving Chet’s. They
proceeded in the direction of the
hill. Then... yes, they hitch-
hiked up the hill and were de-

They kiew what they had to do
and went immediately to work.
You know . . . ELKING can be

They moved cautiously. Then,

tened on the ground again resum-

task was completed. Not a daf-
fodil remained. They started
down the hill ‘carrying bouquet’s
of loot when they spied a little
man, pushing a big laundry cart
out of the quad. He was a rea-

HILLTOP

Ferdinand Waldo Demara or!
“the great impostor” certainly |
met his match in a poor cobbler |
named Wilhelm Voight, whose}
true story is told in The Captain
from Koepenick, Hilltop’s presen-
tation for tomorrow evening at
8 p. m. in Vaughan Literature Au-
ditorium. |

Because a passport was denied |
him, Voight obtained a second-
hand captain’s uniform and be-
came the commander of a squad
of soldiers in the Kaiser's Im-
perial Army, a position he quick-
ly took advantage of by ordering |
his men to arrest the Mayor of
Koepenick and taking him to}
Berlin. |

What happened to Voight and
his amazing masquerade provides
for unusual entertainment in this
film that is based on Carl Zuck-
mayer’s ckassic comedy. When
first released in 1956, The Cap-
tain from Koepenick received
rave reviews from most news-
papers and is now generally con-
sidered to be one of the best Ger- |
man films of post-war years.

LM was first to offer you a pure white modern filter
—the famous Miracle Tip—pure white inside, pure
white outside. And L&M’s modern filter enables you
to fully enjoy the rich flavor of golden ripe tobaccos.
So reach for flavor ... reach for L&M.

The L&M Campus Opinion Poll was taken at over.100 colleges where
L&M has student representatives, and may not be a statistically

Research Grant |

Dr. William S. Porter, associate }
prof r of physics, has been|
awarded a $7,700 grant by the Na-
tional Science Foundation for the
support of a research entitled |
Theoretical Analysis of Deuteron |
Reaction and Scattering. |

The grant will enable Dr. Por-
ter to explore the theory of scat-
tering heavy hydrogen nuclei, or
deuterons, by light nuclei in order
to gain information about the in-
teractions which occur between}
these sub-atomic particles. By |
the analysis of experimental data
obtained from the scattering and
nuclear reactions of these nuclei,
it will then be possible to ex-
amine the feasibility of obtaining |
polarized, or preferentially orient-
ed, beams of deuterons.

|

If such nuclear beams can be!
ebtained, it is anticipated that a}
able amount of useful |
ion concerning the forces
between nuclei will be provided. |
Covering a 15-month period, |
the gr: includes funds which |
will permit Dr. Porter to appoint |
an undergraduate assistant for!
the summer months and to use
IBM digital computing equipment |
in carrying out some of the nu-
merical work associated with the |
project curing the later stages of
the research.

Two years ago, the Bucknell Student Forum had its
dynamic conception. Enthusiastically hailed by both the
faculty and students, it was dedicated to the reaction of
student apathy. The Forum’s goal was to bring outstand-
ing speakers to the campus to “introduce students to mat-
ters currently of concern to our society and to stimulate
them to new interests and serious thinking.”

Yet, recently the Forum has drifted away from its usual
procedures. Last year’s programs utilized a formal de-
bate format in which two speakers discussed Negro voting
rights, the place of censorship in a democracy, the con-
nection between Labor’s bargaining power and its corrup-
tion, and democracy as viewed by an American commun-

ist. The later Forum programs have been centered around
single speakers and more specific topics—namely, planned
eugenics and contemporary art as understood by artist
and layman.

While both types of programs are manifestations of the
Forum’s intended scope, these most recent issues have in-

cited little student interest. This apparent lack of appeal
has been characterized by decreased student attendance
(as indicated when only 25 students were present for
Monday night’s program; and hence, a decreased number
of Forums has been the undesirabe result.

It seems to us that this deficiency may be traced back
to several things. Perhaps students are more attracted to
the debate style than to the lecture style. Perhaps the
intellectual level of the many students cannot be equated
with the level on which the recent programs have been
conducted. Or, perhaps the Forum Committee’s lack of
organization, substantiated by their inability to obtain
speakers in advance and the almost negligible amount of
advance publicity, has caused the present crisis.

Hoping that this situation is remedied, we offer these
criticisms because we feel that by now the Bucknell Stu-
dent Forum should have gained enough in experience and
stature to rank among the mast important organizations
on campus.

Don’t Tread on Me

Generally when a person speaks of a university, the
first thoughts concern the academic advantages or disad-
vantages, the social atmosphere, and perhaps even the
faculty members of that particular school: One aspect,
however, that is often overlooked, is the importance of
the physical appearance of a campus and the impression
it gives to visitors, \

Bucknell is indeed fortunate to have such a beautiful
natural setting for its campus. The countryside is a mag-
nificent and pleasant environment; the architecture of the
buildings enhance the attractive atmosphere and supple-
ment the landscape. The maintenance department tries
to meet the needs of our schoo! community and makes im-
provements continually. The new administration build-
ing will soon be be completed, even to the finishing touch
of landscaping the area around the quadrangle. The stu-
dent parking lot is being enlarged; Carnegie building is
undergoing necessary repairs and the work on the library
tower is scheduled to begin soon. Our maintenance crew
has been busily repairing the landscape after the long
winter in order to keep our campus attractive.

With improvements such as these, it is the responsibil-
ity of every Bucknellian to respect the campus and to
take care of itt. We should show pride in our alma mater
and appreciate its environment. Now that spring has ar-
rived, we should WALK ON THE PATHS—NOT ON THE
GRASS! The University is doing its part to preserve this
campus. The remaining responsibility is, therefore, placed
upon each student. Are YOU going to take that respon-
sibility?

{Dear Editor,
On behalf of the Lewisburg Fre
Department, I would like to ex-|
press our thanks for the compli-|
‘mentary editorial in the issue of |
April 28. This editorial makes}
all of us feel that our work—from |
training and maintaining the!
equipment to actual fire-fighting |
|—is appreciated and subsequent- }
{ly gives our morale a big lift.)
|We believe that we are the best |

jpraise from outside, since it is

jcator of the worth of the depart- ;
;ment. i
The praise received from the
| SPE fire is especially meaningful
| since it was an extremely difficult |
fire to fight and the damage was
jhigh. When people, outside the
| fire service, who are not aware of

Dear Editor,
The staff of WVBU would like

to thank the editorial staff of The}

Bucknellian for the constructive,
although somewhat erroneous,
editorial entitled Campus Mono-
tone which appeared in the issue
of April 21. While we agree that
there are numerous weaknesses in

tivities (they would learn to gov-
ern themselves after they had
graduated). Thus, a policy of
registering all pebble-throwing
was started, and written permis-
sion was necessary before the
students could gather for organ-
ized pebble-throwing. The policy
did much to solve the problem
because. now everyone knew
when everyone else was throwing
pebbles, and the administration
could control the number of peb-
bles that were going into the river
\(thus eliminating any possibility
of a flood).

But, one weekend, one of the
| pebble-throwing groups forgot to
register their pebble-throwing; it
wasn’t that ‘they didn’t want to
jregister their pebble-throwing, it’s
just that this group didn’t know
they were going to throw pebbles
\that weekend until Friday morn-
ing. You see, one of the pebble-
throwing groups had the misfor-
tune of losing all their pebbles
Lwhen the river rose a bit because
of a spring shower; so, another
group decided to share their peb-
bles with the unfortunate ones,
land in the mix-up, the pebble-
throwing was not registered. (It
was too late to register the activ-
ity anyway, and a rising river is
no excuse for unorthodox pro-
cedure). This was a serious vio-
lation of the rules, and as a re-
sult, both groups lost their peb-
| ble-throwing privileges for a
\ while.
| I am not quite sure what hap-
pened after that, but I believe
{that my grandfather said that it
worked out well in the end, be-
cause the next year the adminis-
tration put an end to the pebble-
throwing for everyone .. . and
‘this was good because everyone
became very serious and very
stagnant, and instead of throwing
pebbles in the river, they threw
pebbles at each other. This was
good too, because there was no
unified pebble-throwing spirit to
conflict with studying. The only
trouble was that one day a pebble
happened to hit a high school
senior who was visiting the cam-
pus. Now, you don’t hear very
much about that school, in fact,

member its name.

LAW BOARD ASKS
FOR WRITING ABILITY

In the future, prospective law
students will need to pay more
attention to the development of |
their writing skill and their
knowledge of this country’s cul-
tural background. |

Beginning next November, the}
Law School Admission Test, now
required by 86 of the nation’s law
schools, will include separate tests
of writing ability and general
background. This announcement
was made today by the executive |
committee of the Law School Ad-
mission Test Policy Committee at
the Conference of Western Law
Schools, meeting at Stanford Uni-
versity, Palo Alto, California.

The 80-minute writing ability
test is designed to measure the
student’s command of grammar
and diction as well as his ability |
to recognize verbose or unclear
writing. It will test his skill in
organizing ideas and require him
to demonstrate his competence by
re-writing and editing prose pas-
sages. The main purpose of the
test of general background is to
measure the student’s awareness
of the intellectual and cultural

A ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME

As Commencement Day draws near, the question on everyone's
lips is: “How did the different disciplines come to be marked by
academic robes with hoods of different colors?” Everybody—
but everybody—is asking it. I mean I haven’t been able to walk
ten feet on any campus in America without somebody grabs my
elbow and says, “How did the different disciplines come to be
marked by academic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?”

This, I must say, is not the usual question asked by collegians
who grab my elbow. Usually they say, “Hey, Shorty, got a
Marlboro?” And this is right and proper. After all, are they not
collegians, and, therefore, the nation’s leaders in intelligence
and discernment? And do not intelligence and discernment de-
mand the tastiest in tobacco flavor and smoking pleasure? And
does not Marlboro deliver a flavor that is uniquely mellow, a
selectrate filter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, a box
that is hard? You know it!

F da ; :
“Ut lal Seahes cote Inve coe?”

But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.
A doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears
green, a master of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities wears
crimson, 2 master of library science wears lemon yellow. Why?
Why, for example, should a master of library science wear lemon
yellow?

Well sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to
March 29, 1844. On that date the first’ public library in the
United States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos’s neighbors were of course wildly grateful—all, that
is, except Wrex Todhunter.

Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both
men had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had
chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
Sigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise
Mambo, the Shay’s Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.
Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all
owing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.
(He was struck by a falling praline.)

Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos’s
library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.
This he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.
Sigafoos. “‘What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven’t got?’”’ Mr.
Todhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came te
him: books.

So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books
and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
But Mr-Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There-
upon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea
with sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with
sugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving
tea with sugar and cream and lemon.

This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be-
cause he had the only lemon tree in town—in fact, in the entire
state of North Dakota—and since that day lemon yellow has of
course been the color on the academic robes of library science.

(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library
and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There
were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,
alas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced
to California until 1931 by John Wayne.) © 1961 Max Shulman

BOWS TO NAVY

For seven innings the Bisons
played their best ball of the year,
but then the roof caved in and the
baseballers found themselves on
the short end of a 13-6 score in a
game played again: a strong
Navy nine at Annapolis on Thurs-
'day, April 27.

Bucknell broke a 5-5 tie with a
run in the seventh inning on Ken
Twiford’s third home run of the
season; however, Navy exploded
with 8 runs in the eighth inning
| against three BU hurlers to break
the game wide open. The big
blow of the inning was a three-

run homer by Joe Bellino of Navy
football renown.

The Midshipmen scored the first
run on a homer in the third inn-
ing, but the Bisons notched two
in the fourth to take the lead.

BISONS CRUSH
JUNIATA 15%4-2%

The Bison golfers captured
three matches rather handily this
past week, defeating Lehigh, Get-

their spring record to 6-1.

On Tuesday, the Bisons out-
slammed Juniata on the oppon-
ents’ course by a 15% - 2% score.
Bob Etzweiler split with his op-
ponent 144-114, while Bob Schad,
Curt Mull, Pete Sang, Jerry Sing-

off victories. Singer’s margin
was 2-1, while the other four
players swept 3-0 victories .

The story was almost the same
on Saturday, as the Bisons were
incongenial hosts to Gettysburg,
beating the visitors 1544-214. All
six BU golfers triumphed, with
Etzweiler, Mull, and Sang win-
ning 3-0. Etzweiler played the
course in 74 strokes.

Last Friday -the Bucknellians
pitched and putted past the Engi-

A Day To Remember

May 2, 1961. A day to Remember. The much maligned, oft-
berated, and undermanned track team SWEPT to victory in a triang-
ular meet. The once winless tennis team won its cond straight
match. The dependable golf team crushed the opposition. In other
words Bucknell went 3 for 3, batted a thousand, brought home all
the bacon, all in one day. If a baseball game had been played and
the Bisons emerged victorious, suspension of classes for a day would
be the only proper recognition. Actually, the teams are to be con-
gratulated for fine efforts on all three fields. Only weeks ago the
outlook for victories, or victory, with the exception of the golf team,

as one filled with doubt if not apprehension. Despite the “rotten”

| weather, sunny days are here again.

Power At The Plate

The fact that the baseball team was leading Navy last Thursday |

6-5 at the end of 7% innings was the result of four sluggers on the
now 0-5 outfit. Dreams of snapping the “Middi 12-game winning
streak were shattered by an eight run barrage in the bottom of the
eighth frame, but not before Bucknell hitting amazed a Navy observ
er into remarking that the BU Bisons were one of the best teams thi
Annapolis nine had faced. Ash Ditka currently leads the “Murder
er’s Row” with a .389 average, including a double, a triple, and

RBI’s. Sophomore Sam Neisner is batting .368, including a pair of
home runs against Albright. Ken Twiford has belted three circuii

clouts in notching a .353 average, collecting 16 total bases in 17 at!

bats for a .941 slugging percer e. Bart Richards has banged out
three doubles among the hits d in his .333 mark.

Navy Extends Winning Streak

Navy extended their streak to 13 by beating the Bisons, thus
setting a new school mark. They have since upped the skien to 15
wins in arow. Bucknell continues to outgoof the opposition, bobblin

about that, but also about Dr.)
Karraker himself. Last week he
told me that one of his articles on
this subject had been reprinted |
by a Soviet Union newspaper.
Intrigued by this, I went to see
Dr. Karraker again to get all the
details.
Migrant Children

The story begins in 1956 when
Dr. Karraker wrote an article for
The Christian Century magazine,
entitled, Forgotten Child Labor-
ers. The article was so powerful!
that it was reprinted by the Na-
tional Child Labor Committee,
and also by three leading maga-|
zines. It is listed by the*United
States Department of Labor as
ene of the outstanding features
on migrant laborers.

All was quiet for two years, but
word came to Dr. Karraker, ;
through an Estonian student then
studying at Bucknell, that his ar-
ticle had been printed in an Es-
tonian newspaper. This student’

which

will still be a great necessity for
features such as this, which are,
as has been demonstrated, grist
for the Communist propaganda
mill. Dr. Karraker cannot do it
alone.

A microwave system for closed-
circuit transmission of educational
TV programs has been developed
and announced by Collins Radio
Company’s Texas Division located
in Dall Texas.

The microwave system operates

situation of all children on farms.
It presents a “picture of the evil
exploitation of the children in the |
USA.” This is a paragraph from |
the Estonian version, which has |
deliberately nisconstrued the}
words in the original:
Propagandists across the
ocean are wasting a lot of
work and energy to make
sure that advertisements in
the magazines will show
only well-fed faces . . . Leaf

zine! ... You can be sure
that you cannot find a photo

reflects the picture that the
author has given. The life of
USA's children, full of embit-
terment and insults, accom-
panied with early, hard, tear-
dampened work, is not for
display in America.
Distortions are apparent through-
cut the entire article, but none so
at ging and unfair as that
h depicts this as the plight of
all farm youth, of “Young Ameri-
cans reaming from one plantation
to another, seeking a morsel of
bread.” |
Cornmunist Propaganda
When Dr. Karraker received
this translation, he was naturally
quite stricken. For something
which had been written in an}
honest effort to create more fay-!

sue, and even more to educate the |
public cut of their fantasies con-|
cerning it, to be used as propa-j
ganda by men behind the Iron!
Curtain was a blow to the unsus- |
pecting author. |
And there was another more |
personal reason why Dr. Karraker ;
was most upset by this reprinting. |
In 1958 this country was in the}
midst of an hysterical Communist |
name-calling, due to the impact;
of the McCarthy hearings. It is|
quite understandable that Dr.!
Karraker did not want it known
that his article had been reprint-
ed, even though he himself: did:
not find out for almost two years |
that it had been. Now that thej
craze has passed this story can be}

by Joel Fl

One of the few movie-makers |
in the United States whose films |
are always financial successes is}
Walt Disney, and, since most
people who go-to the movies are
under 21 years of age, it is highly
likely that Disney’s films will al-
ways have an audience. More
than 20 years since Snow White,
Disney still leads the field of the
animated form in their skill and
production, but when one looks at
the road from Fantasia to 101
Dalmatians was it really paved
with the best of intentions? What

has happened to the inventive-
ness, the charming humor, the
beauty and the art of his films?
The truth of the matter is that
only in an occasional “true-life
adventure,” as in the recent
Jungle Cat, is the old master’s
style present.
Disney Declines

This is not to say that the films
Disney makes today are bad films
—anything but that. I thought
that Pollyanna was one of the
best films of 1960, if only for Hay-
ley Mill’s ingratiating perform-
ance, one of the finest I saw last
year for any actress—child or
adult. Swiss Family Robinson was
javery entertaining picture for its
all around good acting and its
final battle scene with the pirates,
done in a tongue-in-cheek man-
ner that was most refreshing.

Perhaps the best comparison of
{the new Disney to the old could
be found with 101 Dalmations.

Now this is admittedly a very:

well made feature length cartoon
with an awareness for detail in
which Disney’s artists have reign-
ed supreme for years.
‘Dalmations’ Disappoint
But what begins as an amusing

The theft of 14 dalmations took
almost all my sympathy; 101 were
just too many for me to handle.

| Granted, it’s “cute, nice, pleasant,
|agreeable, story,” but it’s a far

ery from his earlier works.

I’m afraid that the experimen-
tation, the willingness to take a
chance on the public by present-
ing something different and excit-
ing, has just about disappeared
from Disney’s studio. Even one
of his new ten-minute cartoons is
sadly lacking in humor. And I
don’t think these are the ravings
of a person who longs for the
good old days of his childhood
years. They are only the beliefs
of someone who regrets the
changing of a great and imagina-
tive artist to a highly professional
entertainer who has so under-
standably capitalized on his
unique fame.

9:30 Class Features
Parent-student Panel

This week’s 9:30 Class will pre-
sent a program that will be a
little different from any of the
others so far this year. It will
include a panel of both students
and parents who will be discuss-
jing the topic, Our Changing Re-
|ligious Beliefs as We Become
Adults. Because this is Parents’
Weekend it presents an excellent
opportunity for the parents to ex-
press their ideas about a topic that
| would interest Bucknellians.

The panel will include Mr. and
Mrs. Wilmot Flemming, Mr. and
Mrs. Jay Hudson, Ron McLaugh-
lin, and Edik Mason. Everyone
is invited to come and to bring
his parents. Breakfast will be
served at 9:15.

The main significance of the first Mercury space capsule
lay in its being a key step toward this country’s first
manned orbital flight. However, this orbital mission was
preceded by a frenzied controversy regarding national in-
tegrity. : : :

Americans are probably. the most informed society in
the world. It has been government policy during the last
four years to acquaint the American public with the pro-
gress being made on the man-in-space program. This
space program has been revealed to us throughout its
ascendency to success, including the failures it incurred
at various stages of its development.

However, there are many pseudo-politicians who mani-
fest great vituperation in condemning the lack of secrecy
practiced by our government concerming our space fail-
ures. These people argue that the United States loses in-

ternational prestige when it publicly promulgates its fail-
ures. They further contend that Russia’s vast materializ-
ing success in science and her consequent gain of interna-
tional prestige is due to her impregnable censorship
system whereby scientific failures remam undisclosed to
the public. These people assert that Russia may have ex-
perienced a great deal of failure prior to her successes,
but these failures were effectively veiled and were accom-
panied by no subsequent loss of prestige. They say that
if the United States were less pretentious about its fail-
ures, it would have more influence upon neutral nations
than Russia now has.

Let us not-be fooled by these puerile theories and opin-
ions. If our government suppressed facts in regard to the
progress of the space program, it would be inconsistent
with our ideals as Americans. Communist Russia thrives
on the obliteration of free expression of ideas. Her masses
remain uninformed and live ina cloak of veiled evidences
and promises of success. However, the omnipotent cen-
tral government only allows its people to know what it
wants them to know. America was founded on the pre-
cepts of democracy. As a democracy, she must adhere to
her inherent national integrity; her citizens are born with
a right to know her failures as well as her successes.

Within the past five years Bucknell University has
made tremendous strides forward both in academic stand-
ards and in improvement of its physical plant. Because
of this noteworthy progress, a Bucknell education . be-
comes more valuable each year.

The rise in academic standards is largely a result of the
quality of our faculty. The percentage of faculty mem-
bers with Ph. D. degrees has increased in recent years.
While this alone does not insure more effective teaching,
it does guarantee better preparation. “Bucknell does at- | for
tempt to hire individuals who are also persons,” Dean
Karl D. Hartzell states, “because learning is conditioned seem to get
in large part by the relationship and degree of involve- done faster
ment which develop between student and teacher.” Our and

Over the past 10 years the proportion of grades received
by students has changed little, although in terms of Col-
lege Entrance Examination Board scores and high school
rank, the quality of incoming classes has improved sub-
stantially. This seeming paradox can be explained by
the rising expectations of the part of the faculty. The
percentage of students attaining Dean’s List grade point
averages has also remained about the same, or possibly
even dropped because of the elimination of “QC courses”.
The faculty, generally, is reported to be pleased with the
higher quality of students, and fewer faculty members
each year choose to leave Bucknell.

Another major area of academic improvement is the re-
cently initiated Honors Program. The University Honors
Program includes three Colloquia in the arts and sciences.
Departmental Honors Programs have been developed in
Economics and Business Administration, French, German,
History, Political Science, and Psychology. The already
existing Honors Program in English has been continued,
and that in Sociology has been revamped. These Depart-
mental Honors Programs include special seminars, tutori-
als, and independent study. Multiple-section courses have
been established in many departments as part of the com-
bined Honors Programs.

Yes, we could have concealed our failures in the space
program—and we could have, perhaps, gained more inter-

national prestige with our

achievements—but the sup-

pression of these failures would have been directly con-
tradictory to our national integrity as expressed in the

Bill of Rights!

extra prestige accorded to us by other nations and sacri-

BLUES’ BEAT
"WHITES’ 14-6

The Bucknell football team
closed out its Spring practice last
scrimmage on a sloppy, rain-swept
scrimmage on a sloppy rain-swept
field at Memorial Stadium The
“Blue” team, with Doug Williams
at quarterback, scored a 14-8 vic-
tory over the “white” squad.

Williams, who is the favored
candidate for Paul Terhes vacated
position, tossed a 10-yard pass to
freshman John Thornton to give
the “Blue’s” victory. The “Blue”
team scored again when Matt
Hoet, a frosh from Lansdowne.
Pa., ran 66 yards to a touchdown.

The “White” eleven tallied when
a center pass sailed- over Williams’
head into the end zone and a
charging lineman fell on the ball
for a safety. Williams had at- |
tempted to punt the “Blues” out |
of a fourth down situation. Bob
Lipinski picked off a William’s
aerial and scooted 23 yards to|
score the “White’s” only tally.

Hart, a speedy halfback, picked
up 100 yards in the scrimmage on |
seven carries. Doug Williams |
connected on four of eight passes |
for 38 yards. |

The team will report to school |
for their next practice in August
when they prepare to defend their |

ambert Cup Championship.

The Bison tennis team had their
closest match last Friday as they
lost to Penn State 6-3. As will
|be shown by individual scores,
this five hour match could have
been the Bison’s fourth win of the
season.

Captain Jim Hand’s return to
\the team was spoiled when he
lost in three sets at first singles.
Jim won the first set 6-4, but he
| found his shots falling just long
in the second and third sets as he
lost 6-4, 6-3.

Mike Nachwalter posted one of
the two Bucknell wins in singles
as he won in straight sets. Frank
Famariss was the other Bison to

6-4, 4-6, 6-2 at sixth singles.
Doug Herkner, Ted Altman,
and Bob Heuman all lost their

singles matches to make the score |
4-2 with the doubles still to be}
played. At first doubles Jim Hand |
and Mike Nachwalter won easily |
to put the Peters’ men within one |
match of the Nittany Lions. The |
third doubles team of Ted Altman |
and Bob Heuman won their first |
set, but were unable to capture |
either of the last two sets. Doug}
Herkner and Frank Famariss lost
their marathon second doubles

match, 11-9, 7-5.

Parachutists Take Fourth in Jump

The Bucknell parachuting team
met their first intercollegiate com-
petition last weekend at Orange,
Massachusetts. The team, which
was organized by Lieut. Richard
Grabow in the fall of 1960, placed
fourth, outscoring Ivy League’s
Harvard, Priceton and Cornell.

Of the active members, six rep-
resentatives were flown to the

BU Wins Third

Straight Title

On Monday, May 8, Bucknell’s
outstanding golf four-some of
Bob Etzweiler, Bob Schad, Curt,
Mull, and Jerry Singer captured
the 12th annual Middle Atlantic |
Conference Tournament at the.
jrem Temple Country Club in|
Dallas, Pa. It was Bucknell’s first |
MAC championship of the year.

Come From Behind

The Bison golfers came from al
three-stroke deficit at the end of |
18 holes to win the 36 hole medal |
play tournament by four strokes. |
This was the fifth time in the last!
six years that Bucknell won the)
tourney, and marked the third |
time in succession. Never before)
has any school been able to ac- |
complish that feat. |

There were 72 golfers repre-|
senting 18 different schools par-|

respectively. Bob Schad tied for
16th with a 166 round. Lehigh,
the leader after 18 holes, finished
{second with a team score of 651

four strokes behind the Bisons.
Delaware finished third at 662,
'15 strokes off the pace. Mike
| Turnbull of Delaware carried off
the individual honors, posting an
ye score of 152.

Ironic Finish

| Both Etzweiler and Schad par-!

‘enough, they both finished lower

in the individual Standings than
they did in either of the previous |
years. Etzweiler was the tourna- |

. THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA,

really is the man who holds up}
the world. The grotesquely danc-
ing Mullins join hands and shriek
their shared derision at John
West. He climbs upon the bench,
with both hands still raised above
his head, and finally, unable to
convince them or escape them, he
lowers his arms and allows the
world to fall down on the Mullin
family.
Avant-Garde Effect

Nancy Owen has not attempted
to draw the characters fully in
this play. ‘She has instead creat-
ed two-dimensional people who
exactly meet the character re-
quirements of All Fall ‘Down.
These flatly drawn characters are
more vivid and less predictable
than pure and simple types.
Nancy uses normal family figures
and situations with a great deal
of hyperbolic skill. The postures
and dialogue of the Mullin family
are all calculated to dramatize
the problem of speech without
communication, in quasi-realistic |
terms. The total dramatic effect
of the play is one of avant-garde
shock based on humor and hys-
teria handled at an ever increas
ing pitch. The crashing of the!
world at the end of the play is)
abrupt and surprising but not a
‘deus ex machina’. This ending
is well provided for by the in-}
ternal dramatic hysteria of the;
play, and fuses many, desperate |
characters and actions into a
common conclusion.

I have one major criticism of
the play. It was too short for
the audience to catch it’s full |
meaning. I think some music at
the opening and five minutes
more of performance time would |
have provided a stronger and a}
more coherent framework for the
play.

Performance Strong |

The opening night actors in, All|
Fall Down were of widely vary-
ing ability and training but they
gave a generally strong perform-!
ance. Ellen Headley, as Maude-
Alice Mullin, lost her lines in sev-
eral places but was effective
nevertheless. Ellen may haye
missed a few words along the
way, but she never misplaced
Maude-Alice’s high tension tem-
perament, which is her crucial
contribution to the play’s emo-
tional fabric. Christopher New-
ton, as Henry Mullin, played soft- |
ly in the background for the most
part, but when his acting did come
to the fore, it was impeccable.

The part of Norman Dudley
Mullin was physically filled by |
Billy Graham. He was built for}
the part, though he wasn’t quite |
trained for it. I thought his tone |

was it the third—or the sixth?
After a while, it was difficult to
keep track. Anyways, our old
friend David Crockett (we'll call
him Davy from now on; everyone
but Colonel “never smile” Travis
did) had a feather fight (too com-
plex to explain here) with one of
his men. This little piece of Ten-
nessee color made us know that
Davy was a regular guy.

Right before the historic battle
took place, there was a scene in
which one of the volunteers—
Jocko was his name—wanted to
leave the about-to-be-sacrificed
church, but his blind and loving
wife saved him from losing his
honor by demanding that he re-
main at the fort, in which case he
only lost his head. It almost
brought tears to my eyes. And
one scene actually did. The night
before the battle, Jethro, Jim
Bowie’s trusty slave for 80 years,
was granted his freedom, and, in

ja surprising and moving turn of

the plot, loyal Jethro decided to
stick it out with his former mas-
ter. Weil, poor Jethro truly stuck
it out to the end by being stuck

Bowie a few more precious mo-
ments to kill 50 more Mexican
soldiers before he, too, found him-

position.

I have rarely seen heroes die

was as he stood for nearly five
minutes, a mere saber having
been thrust clean through his
body. And, though Davy was

Opinions V ary
On Soph Rush

Recently on the Bucknell cam-
pus the question of sophomore
versus freshman sorority rush has
attracted wide interest. Delta
Zeta sorority has proposed that
rushing in the beginning of the
sophomore year with an accom-
‘panying policy of “open dorms”
after the first six weeks of the
first semester would be superior
to the present system. A sampling
of the climate of opinion at Buck-
nell concerning this question has
revealed that although interest in
the proposal is extensive, opinions
toward it are very diverse. No
outstanding trend either for or
against the proposal was evi-
denced.

Pros and Cons

Interest in the proposal was
naturally greatest among those
most affected by it—present sor-
ority members. Nearly every
member consulted offered some
posal felt that postponement of
'two main arguments were given.
‘ Sorority women against the pro-
posal felt that postponemen of
rush would weaken sororities
disastrously. Many felt that the
“sororities would disappear.” Sor-
ority women favoring the pro-
posal offered essentially the same
| reasons as did Caryl Burton, pres-
|ident of KD: “I favor sophomore
rush strongly. It would cut down
on rushing meetings and allow
more time for worthwhile soror-
lity activities.” Most sorority
women appeared to be torn be-

Roulette, Anyone?

by Bill Danneberg
There’s a new campus game; it’s called Firecracker Roulette. For!
the playing field, you need an area of at‘ least 300 acres (a friendly |
300 acres will do). . The rules are simple—wait for the first ae
spring night; light a firecracker, throw it, and then see whether or not |
you get thrown out of school. It’s a game of chance (for you gamb- |

told not to have the party, as;

| all arrangements, plus the fact the |

lown by Dean Hayward was this:
“With ‘the exception of Spring
Festival Weekend, May 6 and 7,
and the Alumni Weekend of
June 2 and 3, no social events of
any kind may be held by the fra-
ternity (Theta Chi) at its house or
elsewhere.” As can be seen, this
punishment only eliminated the
Houseparty Weekend.

A few days after this punish-
ment was imposed upon us, we
were informed that the Social
|Committee was, in the interest of
leniency, going to review the case
Before they reviewed the c
they asked us if we had any sug-
gestions as to what would be a
suitable alternate punishment. We
|suggested the possibility of equal
|time on probation next semester.
A day later, we were given the
committee’s decision which stated:
“The Theta Chi Fraternity will
not be permitted to register social
functions during the first seven
weeks of the 1961-1962 academic
year.” We are, however, allowed
to have Parent’s Weekend and
Homecoming. Dean Meyn further
stated, “I feel that the fraternity
has been shown leniency by the
social committee.”

We would like to ask the fol-
|lowing question: Is trading one
weekend for five a more lenient
i punishment? None of the Broth-
‘ers of Theta Chi think so, even
though the decision did give us
Houseparty Weekend back.

I hope this letter has cleared
up all existing rumors, and that
the student body can now accur-
ately determine whether or not
the punishment fits the crime.

Dear Editor,

At this time I would like to
express my thanks for the re-
sponse my articles have received
this year. I had no idea when I
was writing that first article last
summer that the response would
be anything like it was. I hope
you have found the articles inter-
esting and informative. I myself
have certainly enjoyed writing
them and look forward to con-
tinuing to do so next. year if you
wish it. I hope that through these
articles I have been able to show
there is less difference between,
“your world” and “my world”.
Certainly, there are differences
between the two worlds, but
there are also similarities.

For those who responded to my
request for readers at the begin-
ning of the year I wish to express
a special thank you. I know there
are still some who would have
volunteered, but hearing that I
had a full schedule were thereby
junable to read to me. But, as
you know, there have been seniors
reading for me this semestér and
I'll be needing replacements.

I am still amazed at the re-j;
| sponse I did receive for my re-
'quest for readers. This semester
I have been able to go through
both afternoon and evening every
day with readers. For this I am
grateful and can only say thank
you. This semester I have had
readers and work, but a lack of
| time.

As I have indicated above, I
will still be needing readers next
year, and so I shall be so bold as
to once again restate the request

getting thrown in. As a matter
of fact, two of Kappa Sig’s 600
pledges didn’t come up. Every-
one cheered.

The SAE house was pretty
quiet during the weekend. I saw
SAE men at every house I went

\to. I guéss they enjoyed them- }

selves. I guess the members of
theff band enjoyed themselves,
too.

Fiji had a cool band from
Washington. Everyone there was
ripping it up with the twist. The
Merit Laundry probably forgot to
starch their trench coats this
week.

The SAM’s saw Roger Green
off for Miami. In the true spirit
of brotherhood, he suggested that

the house save money by just get- |

ting a single room at the Eden

to see him go.

I want to thank the night
watchman who lent me his suit
and lunch whistle. I especially
enjoyed my tour through Harris
Hall during Houseparty. The
girls put on a wonderful show.
But, that’s not a nice thing to say
about our Sem Gems, so I will
add that they look so beautiful
and collegiate when they sit on
Bucknell’s campus sunning them-
selves. It looks good, but the
fiys are terrible and there are
ants all over the place.

It’s final exam time, so I'll leave
you to your studies. Remember,
exams are merely a means of ex-
pressing your cultural and techni-
cal achievements. (Don’t believe
a word of that. I only said it to
impress ‘any faculty members who

students, don’t forget, that a QC
course is a thing of beauty and a
joy forever. Have a nice sum-
mer, anyway.

of Women, concerning the Del-

in last week's ‘Bucknellian’
were originally solicited as :
part of a feature article. They :
were not intended as a letter :
to the editor. 5

Dear Editor,

For three and one half years
(minus a semester when he was
studying abroad). Mr. William Jay
Jacobsen, II, has set himself up
as a self-appointed drama critic
at Bucknell. His criticisms have
not heretofore been attacked in
any. way—probably because he
has not said anything worthy of
refutation. So far, his criticisms,
though meagre, have been for the
most part satisfactory. Last week,
however, you surprised me by
publishing a supposed critical ar-
ticle by him on the recent produc-
tion of The Male Animal.

This article skirted the field of
criticism and remained complete-
ly submerged in the bog of mud-
slinging. Mr. Jacobson’s remarks
were wholely subjective and ir-
relevant to an analysis of the
production. Not only did he toss
unfounded accusations at the di-
rector, Mr. John Wilson, and sev-
eral other members of the mast,
whom he considers both over-
worked and overrated, but he also
lavished praise on the production
of Nancy Owen’s one-act play,
All Fall Down, for its cast of
relatively unknown actors of
which, of course, he was one.

Mr. Jacobson, in making this
attack, aligns himself with a curi-
ous group of people at Bucknell
who are unwilling to support cer-
tain artistic and creative attempts
on this campus and, instead, try
to defeat them by spurious as-
saults that are in no way related
to constructive criticism. Mr.
Jacobson’s critical colors have
finally come to the fore, and I
sincerely hope that your editorial
policies will prevent him from
making any similar unwarranted
attacks in the future.

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not walled me in. They could never do such a cruel thing.
Manly and muscular they may be, and gruff and curt and direct,
but underneath they are men of great heart and sweet, com-
passionate disposition, and I wish to take this opportunity to
state publicly that I will always have the highest regard for
the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, no matter how my lawsuit
for back wages comes out.

Iam only having my little joke. I am not suing the makers
of Mariboros for back wages. These honorable gentlemen have
always paid me promptly and in full. To be sure, they have not
paid me in cash, but they have given me something far more
precious. You would go far to find one so covered with tattoos as I.

Iam only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not covered me with tattoos. In fact, they have engraved
no commercial advertising whatsoever on my person. My suit,
of course, is another matter, but even here they have exercised
taste and restraint. On the back of my suit, in unobtrusive
neon, they have put this fetching little jingle:

Are your taste buds out of kilter?

Are you bored with smoking, neighbor?
Then try that splendid Marlboro filter,
Try that excellent Marlboro fleighbor!

On the front of my suit, in muted phosphorus, are pictures of
the members of the Marlboro board and their families. Qn my
hat is a small cigarette girl crying, ““Who’ll buy my Marlboros?”

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have been perfect dolls to work for, and so, dear readers, have
you. Your kind response to my nonsense has warmed this old
thorax, and I trust you will not find me soggy if in this final
column of the year, I express my sincere gratitude.

Have a good summer. Stay heaithy. Stay happy. Stay loose.

Diamond Squad Captures First Victory; ‘
Kasnick’s Eighth Inning Triple Decides

The Bucknell baseball team
combined a thrilling late inning |
scoring thrust with a fine pitching |
performance by Mike Kasnick to
win its first game of the season
over the University of Scranton
by a 7-4 score on the BU field.

Kasnick both pitched and bat-
ted the Bisons to victory. He
struck out eight batters and al-
lowed only three bases on balls in
going the distance for the first
time by any Bucknell pitcher this
season. He scattered nine hits
along the route. Mike also col-
lected three hits himself and
drove in four of his team’s total
of seven runs.

The Bisons came to bat in the
seventh trailing by a 4-0 score.
Scranton scored two runs in the
very first inning on a pair of back ,
to back triples and an error. The
visitors added another tally in}
the third on another triple and a}
run producing single. Their final}
run came across in the seventh as |

sacrifice, and a fielders’ choice
ground ball.

After Ken Twiford opened the
seventh by flying out deep to left
field, Sam Neisner singled and
Art Covey drew a walk. Both
boys scored on Kasnick’s single.
Mike tallied the third run of the
ir g as Ash Ditka reached base
safely on an error.

The Bisons took the deciding
advantage in the eighth inning
when they scored three more
runs, as the same boys provided
the scoring punch. Gary Heck

You’re needed... just as your father and grand-
father were. It’s an obligation that a lot of qualified
college men have to meet...that of serving your coun-
try, when and where you are needed.

And the Air Force needs college-trained men as
officers. This is caused by the rapidly expanding tech-
nology that goes with hypersonic air and space flight.
Your four years of college have equipped you to han-
dle complex jobs. You have the potential to profit
from advanced training...then put it to work.
There are several ways to become an officer.

First there is Air Force ROTC. Another program,
relatively new, is Officer Training School. Here the
Air Force commissions certain college graduates, both
men and women, after three months’ training. The
navigator training program enables you to win a
flying rating and a commission. And, of course, there’s
the Air Force Academy. z

An Air Force officer’s starting salary averages out
to about what you could expect as a civilian, First
there’s your base pay. Then add on such things as
tax-free rations and quarters allowances, free medical
and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps flight
pay, and 30 days’ vacation per year. It comes to an
attractive figure. One thing more. As an officer, you

will become eligible for the Air Force Institute of
Technology. While on active duty many officers will
win graduate degrees at Air Force expense.
Why not contact your local Air Force Recruiter,
Or write to Officer Career Information, Dept.
SC15, Box 7608, Washington 4, D.C., if you
want further information about the navigator
training or Officer Training School programs.

The Fourth Annual All-Sports Banquet on Tuesday night was a
rewarding experience for the Bucknell athletes present. The reward
came not from material tributes, or from the turkey dinner, or the
eulogization of Bisons past and present, but rather from the words of
a gray-haired, tanned individual by the name of “Rip” Engle.
Riding the Banquet Trail

Rip Engle’s football teams have vaulted Penn State and its coach :

to the dizzy heights of national recognition, and Mr. Engle’s pois
and fluency from the rostrum reflected something that could hardly
be mistaken for anything but greatness. As the main speaker, and
one who has obviously ridden the “Banquet Trail” many times, Rip
warmed up his receptive audience with a few of the customary quips
and jokes showing extraordinary polish.

The Blue Ridge Bus Line

The veteran (97-51-8-lifetime) coach told of his first days in
college football when his team was beaten 108, 72, 60, and soon. He
never gave his own squad’s score because there never was any. His
team rarely penetrated the ten yard line—their own ten yard line.
Finally, because his team traveled so much and was on the road so
often, a bus was bought, all the students loaded aboard, and the
school was closed. It’s now known as the Blue Ridge Bus Line.

The Why of Football

Since those mythical days, Rip Engle has come a long way in
football, but admitted that until the last two years no one had asked
him exactly WHY anyone should play football or participate in ath-
letics, The question was first asked him by the sponsors of a Euro-

clinic on the sport of football, as Engle and two other U. S.
coaches prepared to teach the fundamentals of the game. The fact
that Rip Engle was nationally known, had coached winning teams,
or had been President of the American Football Coaches Association,
or all his other credentials were nearly as important as his message
Tuesday evening.

Engle justified football and sports in general to his inquisitors
by answering that the material rewards of athletics were insignificant
compared to “feeling” that one receives from sports alone. The feel-
ing of exhiliration in a hard fought win. The feeling of running a

untlet of emotion, ranging from despair, frustration, and exhaust- |
ion to pride, joy, and the indescribable inward satisfaction of triumph.
The all important sense of accomplishment. Only sports provide a
dynamic medium for this “feeling”.

Boys giving of themselves under strain and pressure, displaying
courage, which Winston Churchill described as the “One quality that
allows all others,” determination to win, and consequently knowing |
the intense gratification of successfully fighting for some goal, were}
the points of Engle’s thesis on sports. The “Giving” of oneself, the

ifices, the lessons learned, the friendships made, are all a part of |
the real rewards in sports.

These few paragraphs give only a brief picture of Rip’s philoso-
phy on athletics, but for those who attended, it was refreshing to
hear not a speech blasting the “Play for Pay” athletic image in
America today, but rather a tribute to those boys who seek and know |
the real reward of sports. It’s something that can’t be put on paper,

amped on the back of a medal, or measured in popularity. Every;
id not-so-good, knows what it is.

Maybe you’re a fellow with more or less normal driving habits who’s looking
for a change of pace. Or maybe you're a red-hot sports car buff. Either way,
you'll find the fastest relief for that tantalizing itch in your driving foot at your
Chevrolet dealer’s One-Stop Shopping Center. He’s got cars that run the sport-
ing gamut like no others—nimble Corvair Monzas (2- or 4-door), charged-up
Impala Super Sports (in five different body styles) and the kingpin of, produc-
tion sports cars, the Corvette. You can take your choice without

chasing all over town. They’re all stablemates under the same roof!
