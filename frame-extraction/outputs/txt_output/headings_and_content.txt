    emphatically that they will not inform on cheating fellow students whether
    the cheaters are friends or not. Repeatedly students stated: "The squealer
    is worse than the cheater." For ihis reason, we do not believe that an honor

Content: This summer m arked the be- ginning of an extensive building and renovation
    program on the campus. In order to meet in- creased enrollment, the fourth
    floor of Harris has been converted into residence quarters for 39 women. On
    the ground floor of that building, rooms have been built for seven
    additional stu- dents, including modem facilities and lounge space. The
    University work crew, under the direction of W alter C. Geiger, installed
    non-combustible fire towers in Larison Hall and Harris Hall. The first floor
    of what was formerly Bucknell Cot- tage and the third floor wing of Larison
    have been remodeled. ' A section of Larison was re-design- ed and set aside
    for the use of the Women's Infirmary Staff. New furniture has been put to
    use in the living rooms of Hunt Half, W alker and Stevens House. Classroom
    Changes In the line of improvements to classroom buildings, the most no-
    ticeable change is the renovation of Taylor Hall. The third and fourth
    floors, which were previ- ously used by the mathematics and. education
    departments, now provide additional

    new seminar room. Stadium Renovated The stadium has .also under- gone a face
    lifting. In August i the work crew completed a new concession stand and
    finished re- building two sections of seats at Memorial Stadium. Additional
    improvements were made on roads and paths. The university j road, which
    previously started at I Memorial Stadium and ended at the Vaughan Literature
    building,! has been eliminated; a new park ing area has been installed be
    tween Davis Gymnasium and Bucknell Village on Moore Ave- nue; several new
    campus paths have been . installed and many others resurfaced. New curbing
    has" been installed along Walker and Loomis Streets, the roads re- surfaced,
    and new lighting stand- ards have been erected. Seventy benches which were
    donated by the class of 1960 have been placed throughout the campus. East
    College Independent contractors han- dled the renovation of East Col- lege.
    Renovations costing ap- proximately $530,000 include modem furniture,
    modernization of the rooms and the addition of a lounge and recreation room.
    While s\ill in the early stage of construction, the new Adminis- tration
    Center should be ready for occupancy by June 1, 1960.
