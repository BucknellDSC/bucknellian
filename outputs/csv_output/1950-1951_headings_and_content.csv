Maybe,
Although,
'*Freshman,

"Week""","is ofiicially closed,"
we,feel that the
orientation,"of ."")70 yearlinjjs to their"
new,
home,can't be
accomplished,in a
matter,of
days.,
"Therefore,",
we,don't
think,it's too late to
welcome,the Class of 1954
and,
add,a
hope,that college will
mean,the
beginning,of a
higher,edueati-'n. It
may,
seem,
strange,to
have,full run of a
deserted,
campus,for a
"week,",and then find
upper-classmen,
moving,in as if they
had,a
long-term,lease on the
place.,
To,those
Frosh,
who,
seem,"slight- ed, all"
we,can
say,is the
time-worn,
phrase:,
Bucknellians,aren't
made,
overnight.,FU'iiig registered as a
student,in the
University,doesn't aut<>>-
matically,
make,
one,a
Bucknelban.,
There,
have,
been,students
who've,
gone,four years
without,realizing that
they,are a part (tf the
school.,
And',those are the
students,
who,still feel slighted
when,
graduation,
day,rolls
an)und.,
There,isn't
any,
formula,to follow in
becoming,a
Bucknellian.,It
merely,"takes a little time, a little effort, a little patience,"
and,a lot of interest.
Probably,the first test will
come,
tonight,at the Pej) Rally.
Those,
who,go with a sincere desire to learn the cheers
and,
songs,;ind
make,scmie noise will have a head start on the
Frosh,
who,sits in the
dorm,and
watches,the
parade,
go,by. If a
word,to the
wise,"is sufficient,"
then,
we've,said
enough.,
No,
one,is
going,to lead
you,
down,the
path,to
becoming,a
Buck-,"nellian, nor is"
anyone,
going,to
hand,
you,a
book,of instructions.
Just,"join in the spirit, forget"
your,
days,of
glory,as a senior in
High,"School, let the"
upper-classmen,
do,
the,
talking,
for,
a,
few,

and,you'll be a

And,a few of the rule.-^ will lie different. The coin toss will be
made,10 minutes before the kickoff. Thi.s will allow time to announce the starting line- up after a coach decides whether Lo start his offensive or defensive squad.
A,"15-yard penalty will be given for roughing the place kick holder as well as for roughing the kicker. If on an extra point the point is good, the roughing team still will be penalized on the ensuing kickoff. After time-outs, the clock will start running again"
when,"the ball is ready for play, not when it is"
snapped.,".And if a hand ov forearm is used in block- ing an opponent, it must be kept below the ( pponent's shoulders and must be in contact with his body during the entire block. Oh, yes, there will be one other difference in the"

named,
to,the N'CAA's District
Two,all-star baseball
team.,He
won,five and lost two with an earned run average of 1.9.
The,
campus,
was,
shocked,
a,few years back
(namely,two)
when,death
took,
from,Bucknell the services of one
Herman,
"Hunchmeyer,",
"DS,",
"LLD,",etc.
The,
memory,of
"Hunchmeyer,","how- ever, .still lives"
on.,For it
was,he
who,carefully
prepared,prognostica- lory manu.scripts for the Bucknellian sports
department.,
"Herman,","you see, was a guesser of football games."
His,
average,of right
and,
wrong,rated
among,"the eminent prognostica- tors in the East, but his services were coiispicuous in their absence last .sea- son. When death claimed"
"Herman,",the end of a saga appeared inevitable.
But--,out of nowhere came a streak of white light shining
down,on the understaffed sports
department.,"No,"
Herman,wasn't reincarnated. But his brother
Hugo,"got in touch with us, and"
promised,"to ""uphold the Hunch- meyer tradition to the best of his ability."""
Hugo,
Hunchmeyer,is one of those
"""impossible""",
guys.,
A,simultaneous translator
on,
the,
United,"Nations staff, he is considered a genius by his associates."
And,
Hugo,can translate Carlisle!
To,the uninitiated the ancient Ca: - lisle dialect
may,"have no importance. But to the football fan, Carlisle means"
everything.,
One,
of,
the,greatest
teams,"of all time, the ""Carlisle In- dians"" spoke"
in,
their,
own,secret lingo. It's a
well-known,fact that colfege
and,
professional,
pigskin,coaches
dream,"in Carlisle,- for that is their only ""in"" to the"
unknown,"annals of football. Today, only mentors of ac- credited institutional giid squads are familiar with the language."
We,are indeed fortunate to hav-
Hugo,on our side.
You,"see, coaches (Ireani only in Carli.sle. The"
morning,after they think in English (or mott < f
them,
do).,
But,
Hugo,can simul- taneously translate
"""coach-dreams""","from Carlisle to English, type it up, and have it in the mail to us by the time the"
dream,is over.
Hugo,informed us that he would be glad to help us out by .sending in a
complete,football forecast of Buck- nell's opponents
for,
each,
weekend,during the
approaching,grid season.
And,we accepted his services. Since the first epistle
from,
Hugo,"was necessarily long and facutal, we herewith print only excerpts from the forecast section:"

A.,
D.,"Halliwell, executive secretary of The Scientists' and Enffineers' As- sociation, announces that his Associa- tion has sponsored the ""1<< to 30 Club"" to help specifically educated beginners to help each other in finding jobs."
Membership,is open to
young,men
and,
young,
women,
between,the ages
of,18
and,"30,"
who,have
had,college education (from one year through Ph. p.) or specific education of any Icind after graduation
from,"high school or PS<)Uivalent. The ""18 to 30 Club"""
"members,","while looking for jobs for them.selves, help each other by trying to secure infor- jration"
from,
employers,
about,jobs cpen which
may,be suitable for other Club
members,having different quali-
^'ations.,
Members,"list jobs open of all types (except civil service) where experience is not required, but where specific education is re(|uired, desired, or should help. To simplify and stan- dardize the securing of such job list- ings, the Club funiishes"
members,with
a,printed
"""Message",to
"Employers""",
which,"explains the Club Plan of co- operation, and include.s a ""Job Listing"
"Form""","to be filled in by the employer,"
and,"returned to, the Club."
The,
requirements,
of,"jobs, open,"
thus,"listed, are"
compared,with the qualifications and territorial interests of
"members,","and full details regard- ing specific jobs, including the identi- ties of employers, are then disclosed to"
members,
who,(|ualify ami  who are interested in the areas where specific jobs
a*,located.
Members,then ap- ply directly to the employers concern- ed. This cooperative procedure of trying to help other
Club,
members,
while,looking for a job for oneself
may,appear at first thought to be a deviation
from,the
important,"job of ""getting a job."" Mr. Halliwell points * "" ** * 'm # * # I *#>'''* # * inav 1)0 Very beneficial to the individual i>ecause it tends to increase the effectiveness of his personal calls"
by,helping to get him ill to .see executives at the actual #mploying level.
A,
member,
may,use the Club service without
endeavoring,"to secure list- ings of jobs for others, but Mr. Halli- well points out that those who do take on this extra chore are demonstrating to employers that they have a cooper- alive attitude and initiative"
--,"qualities which are usually of very definite in- terest to employers. The Club has been set up to func- tion on a non-profit cooperative basis, with only nominal charges to cover the actual expenses of operation and administration as"
follows:,
10c,"for complete information, an enrollment form, suggestions as to"
how,"to get the names of logical employers for an individual to call on, and a sample of the"
"""Message",to
"Employers""","form. After securing the above, a pros- I>>ective"
member,"desiring to use the Club service, fills in the enrollment"
form,"(which provide^ spaces for en- tering his education, territorial inter- ests, etc.) and returns it with a $1.(X) enrollment fee. This fee entitles the Miember to one"

whom,"such information was available. It is di- vided into three sections, alphabetical, class, and geographical."
The,"alpha- betical section lists names of all living Bucknellians graduated prior to 1900, and complete class lists for all groups"
graduated,since that
date.,
Alumni,are listed by towns within states and countries in the third part of the book to provide

WELCOME,
Freshmen,"Engineers!: Speaking jointly for the four engi- neering societies and the Engineering Council,"
I,
want,to wish you a good start in your careers.
Four,years
and,one
.summer,"ses- sion from now, you will leave Buck- nell with Bachelor of Science degrees in your respective"
branches.,Despite
much,griping
and,
grumbling,"about your instructors, reports, labs, exams, and the"
C,and
F,"students,"
I,believe you will graduate with the assurance of
having,a
good,
foundation,upon which to build your future.
Your,"engineering future, however,"
depends,
on,other things besides a
diploma.,
One,of these is your con- tacts with the engineering world. The material which you study as an
undergraduate,student is comprised of
fundamentals,which act as begin- ning steps toward your
goal.,While you are
mastering,"these steps, the engineering world doesn't stand still and wait for you, it keeps"
moving,at a
comparably,"supersonic speed in all aspects. There is no reasoi* to feel ""left out"" of this natural progress because the opportunity to keep abreast of these new advances is your.- for the asking."
By,joining the student society or in- stitute connected with
your,"branch,"
you,
keep,posted on your profession in
practice.,* - .. .
You,also meet the other students in your
branch.,
Men,
who,have been through the ropes and can give you helpful hints
and,suggestions about your classes and instructors. .So keep your eyes peeled for signs and notices
around,
campus,
of,the first meeting of your
society.,Thi.- '*olumn will carry the
"names,","date--, and places, too."
We,"will be looking for you, so con; on out!!"
P.,
S.,"All you transfer engineerin;.. students are welcome, too."

We,are also

P<<)inting out to the student body and faculty the financial problems facing institutions of higher educa- tion,  President Hildreth .said that ""the constant cheapening of the value"
j,"of the dollar, by a"
government,which lacks the honesty and courage to face up to its problems by balancing the
I,budget and operating on a pay as you
I,"go policy, is a course of action that"
I,"raises terrific problems for all insti- j tutions, including colleges. Institu-"
I,"tions, of course, do not have the bar- gaining power of unions to force an"

from,

mine,"with its other hand,"" .Mr. Hil- dreth declared."
A,IxMral luue Inflation and the depreciation of the dollar affects not only the University's building
program,but also its ability to give adequate
compensation,to its faculty me.nbers. President Hildreth said. .special recognition was paid by .Mr. Hildreth to fifteen
members,of the faculty who have been here more than 25 years and tf>> ten members
who,"have a .service record of more than 20 years. The militar>- situation also presents problems for the University, .Mr. Hi! dreth observed."
Xo,"military training unit will be net up here this year, hf add'vl. ""Colleges"
know,that next year will i>e different. Bucknell will have to have a decision by the trustees as to whether we shall try to insUII a mili- tary   unit on our campus. The gov- ern.iient it.self does not yet know Jts own plans hut has called a nation- wide meeting of college presidents to he hel.l next week in Washington to tell us as
much,as they can of their plans and our possibilities.
I,"shall be there wiilj Mr. Ranck, but I believe we shall be wise if we carefully con- sider the 'whether"" and the 'what' be- fore  we leap. .My"
own,"guess at the moment, however, is that probably .ve shall have a niiiitary unit on i.ur"
campus,"next year."" 50-50 CoKts"
Turning,"his attention to the stu- dent body, .Mr."
Hildreth,
said,that probably only '>() per ccn of the stu- dent's education is paid by tuition and fees. The balance is paid by gener- ous men and
women,who have donated
money,to the colleges of the country.
"""Too",often college students do not realize this fact until long after they
have,left the ivy-covered walls. In- stead of being
as,
appreciative,"of their opportunities as they ought to be, they follow the good old"
American,
custom,of griping and kicking about
why,"they aren't given this, that or the other thing."
To,grip and kick is a revog^nixed
American,custom and con- structively u.sed is a healthy influence in bringing about
"improvements,",but the
undergraduates,of our
American,"colleges should realize how much they are being given without any cost to them. ""Their creditors are not hard-heart- ed persons, but"
they,do expect the generations
who,have the benefits of their gifts tfi
make,"good by develop- ing their characters, talents, and abil- ities .so as to become Christian ladies"
and,
gentlemen,
and,
good,"citizens. Pleasant as college is for most all, it is not a country club, and its advant- ages and opportunities should not be wasted."""

plagarism,
by,
repeating,it.
"Anyway,",the
main,
theme,of the
1950,
L'Agenda,
was,
some-,thing like this:
"""Too",
many,people
engage,in
extra-curricular,ac- tivities for the thrill of
seeing,their
name,
engraved,on a
"medal"".",
The,ol)servation isn t a
new,one. nor i.^ the
condemnation,of the prestige- ^cckcr'^ original I'm there !>* a
moral,to the >tory.
While,the year is
"young,",one
should,look over the
many,ex- tra-curriculars offered
and,pick out a
few,that will be of
educa-,tional benefit.
Each,activity is
connected,with
some,
phase,of a college
education.,
The,
term,
"""college",
"education""",
can,
be,
a,
broad,one
--,
broad,
enough,to include athletic>
and,.social org.'ini/.ations.
The,
main,thing i> to limit
your,;Mti\itie> to tho>e th.it will be f<f \alue.
For,
"example,",
every,
year,
we,
have,a large
group,at the first
meeting,of
prospective,
workers,for
"""The",
Student,
Voice,
""".",
We're,
glad,to see a large
"turnout,",but are
sometimes,
dismayed,at the ease with
which,
some,
people,shirk respons'bility. So
Freshmen,
beware.,Don't bit otY
more,than
you,can
chew.,
When,vou sign
your,
John,
Hancock,
and,join one of our
many,"or- ganizations, back"
up,
your,
name,
with,interest
and,industry.

Cnger,* **THE
SHOOTING,
"WAR""","Once again Bucknellians have returned to resume their studies and col- legiate fun. With the exception of a few renovation.s, the"
campus,and the
campus,life appears to be
unchanged,.since school ended in
June.,"Yet, this surface stability presents an elusively deceiving picture, a ""new"" Bucknell way *f life came into being one .Saturday in June. In Korea, it wa>i the zero hour at 4 a. m. on"
"Sunday,",the 2.5th of June. Through heavy rain North Korean tank columns
moved,"Houth acroN.s the bor- der. .Soon af(er an officer in Seoul, South"
Korean,"capital, said: ""Thi.s looks like the real"
"thing.""",The e\entM of the past three
months,have completely >erified that
remark.,"The ""cold war"" which had been chilling the world'.s hops for international peace had suddenly and rapidly boiled over into a moderately large-scaled shooting war. The action of the United States was swift and"
aggressive.,"President Tru- ri an issued a statement warning ""those responsible for the act of aggres.sion"" that the United States takes a very serious view of the"
invasion.,
At,Lake .-uccess the United Nations Security Council in its
emergency,".session adopted a United States resolution which called on North Koreans to ""cease hostilities"" and withdraw invasion force.-. It called on all"
U.,
N.,
members,"to ""render every assistance to the United Nations in the exercise of that resolution."" By Tues- day of that same week the"
U.,
N.,Security Council had taken the strongest ac- tion of its history. It
recommended,"""that the"
members,of the United Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as
may,"be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area."" .Moscow's answer to this latest"
manuever,was that the voting was the direct :esult of the .\nierican act of aggression. Once again the United States found iti<elf preparing for a
war.,Just as in World War's
I,and
II.,this latest conflict f<<>und the .American military ma- jliine >>i>etully inadequate for
combating,the well trained and well prepared lorce.* of North
Korea.,.S-lective Service
machinery,"rapidl> went into high gear, and men, beginning at the age of 23, were called into service. ObHolete *-ar plants were soon con\erted into bustling centers of vital industry. Prices <<vent up despite the continued proclamations that there was and .>>till is plenty of everything, and that if the .\merican people exerci.se their sense of fair play, no controls of any kind would be ntH-ei^sary. The piocess of building iii)"
U.,
S.,power took a long period of time when ! .easured in
American,lives and
American,"prestige. I'he hope of a quick vie lory through airpower, or by th^ use of the atomic lioml) was (luickly dispelled. The infantry man, ""old blood and gut>,"" was slugging it out yard by yard. Throughout <the remainder of June, the"
months,of July and .Augu.st
American,"h< pes floundered in a sea of confusion, held up only by that rare quality we have, of not"
knowing,"how to lose. For every mile we lost, the invaders paid a dear toll in men and"
equipment.,"Men, who luidoubtedly knew no more about why they were fighting, than the"
American,
G.,"I.'s who gave their lives tryin,, to destroy others. Laitt week the couraKeous staid of .Vmerican"
and,
South,
Korean,forces paid
off.,
American,supplies and
men,"had arrived in suflicieni quantity to -Hin,{ the tide to one of incessant attack. With the .Marines"
makinu,"an am- phibious landing behind the Ntirth Korean lines, and .\nierican forces pushing rapidly to the South it appears that victory for the United Nations forces ap- pears certain. However, what price"
victory?,
What,price has Bucknell paid for this con- flict ?
What,"price will we continue to pay as the nations of the world battl* Verbally and physically tt) promote a ""better"
"world?""",Bucknell has lost a l.irge
number,of men to the
armed,"forces, some of"
whom,"tnay never have the opportunity to tune in on a ""bull sessjion,"" or spend an evening at the ""Burger."""
What,price will we
pay?,Undoubtedly more of our fellow Bucknellians .shall d'>n the uniforms of Uncle
Sam.,.More men to destroy other men
--,men
whom,they ha\e never
seen.,"War is like a di.sea.se, a disease which creates chao.-> and out of which warped national character is built. Meanwhile, those of us who remain behind shall continue to carry on the ""Bucknell way of life."" All too"
many,of us will never open our eyes to the world around
us.,
We,"shall be too concerned w^ith Saturday night's date, or how"
many,
Q.,C.'s we can
make,thi.s
semester.,"Too  few of us will bother t) read the newspaper, and find out"
why,the peace of the world is tottering on a shaky
foundation.,
W<<,"shall continue to internalize our information second- hand and be unwil'ing to realize that cooperation with the .Soviet Union or any I'.ation in disagreement with our concepts of thinking mu.st be achieved if Buck- nell and all its activities are to remain in the realm of ""true"""
Democracy,-- 1 lasting Democracy.

During,"1949-,5(). 8,100 appli- cants took this test, and their scon-s were sent to 92 law .schools."
A,candidate
must,
make,separate application for admission to each law Bchoo] of his choice
and,should in- quire of each .school whether it wi.shes him to take the
Law,School Admission
Test.,Since
many,law schools select their
freshman,clas.ses in the spring
preceding,"their entrance, candidates for admission to next year's cla.sses are advised to take either the"
Novem-,"ber or the February test, if possible. Bulletins"
and,applications for the test should be obtained four to si\ weeks in advance of the desired test ing date
from,"Fklucational Testing Ser\ice,"
P.,

Completed,applications
must,be received at least ten

in,
the,
Romance,
Seminal,of
the,
Vaughn,Literature Building.
The,national debate topic for this
coming,"years is: ""Resolved that the"
non-communist,nations should form a
new,"international organization."" Var- ious debators have already been gath- ering material about"
the,
pros,and cons of this topic in preparation for the first trip of the season to
New,York City in early
November.,"In addition to this trip, expeditioiis are planned to the Philadelphia and"
Washington,"areas,"
upper,".New York State,"
and,
.New,
Kngland.,Other events being scheduled are
home,and
away,debates with nearby schools in
Pennsylvania.,
The,Bucknell orators also plan to enter various intercol- legiate forensic
tournaments,in the northeast. The
Temple,"University novice tour- nament, usually held during the late fall, holds special interest for fresh- men. It is open to all debators who"
have,never before
debated,intercol- legiately. Bucknell again
plans,
to,
send,a
group,"of its best novice debators to Philadelphia for this event, which is considered invaluable experience foi further debating. All freshmen, transfer students and"
continuing,
uppeiclassmen,interested in debating are invited to attend the first meeting of the
year.,Previous debating experience is not a require- ment for .Society membership. -Any further information can be oh. tained

At,
Annual,
DU,
Convention,Delta
Sigma,Fraternity will climax a half-century as a local organization
when,a
merger,"with Delta Upsilon, International"
Fraternity,"is effected this fall. Action on a charter for the local group was taken at the annual con- vention of Delta Upsilon in Portland,"
Oregon,on
September,9.
Formal,in- itiation of the Bucknell
Chapter,will tentatively take place on
November,4.
Founded,in 1899
Founded,"in 1899 as the Demo.sthen- ta;i Club, the primary objective of the local organization"
was,to provide an opportunity for
improvement,in all forms of
oratory.,
The,
group,"soon ac(|uired the aspect of a social fra- ternity however,"
and,
accepted,the
name,of Delta Sigma. The home of the fraternity
changed,
throughout,the
years,
from,its first quarters in Old
Main,
to,
downtown,
Lewisburg,and in
1917,
the,
Demies,occupied what is now
known,as Hulley
House.,
The,present
home,of Delta
"Sigma,",adjacent to the engi:ieering building
im,"College Hill,"
was,com- pleted ill 1941. 51 Years Despite the transition to a social fraternity the original precepts of the
Demosthenian,
Club,
have,
been,sus- tained. In its fifty-one years of ex- istence Delia
Sigma,has bcccmie one of the
most,
outstanding,local fra- ternities in th ' country. In
merging,"with Delta Upsilon, the Demies will joi;i a national fraternity which"
was,four.ded in 18.'34 at Wil- liams College.
The,
merger,will
make,the
Demies,the oldest fratern- ity on the
campuF.,.*^ince 18.'}4 the fraternity has
grown,to a total of 68 chapters.
The,Bucknell chapter will be the 69th and the eiarhth chapter in Pennsylvania.

Bisons!,by Harvey Sheirr
A,first period outburst carried the Bufknell Bisons to
a,
20-15,victory over GettysbuvK in the opening tussle of the
campaign,at
Memorial,Stadium last Saturday night before 8500 fans.
The,triumph
avenged,
last,"sea.-on's 34-33 loss at the hands of the Bullets. Bob Albert, Van Johnson, and Dick Hetsko sparked the Herd to a win that"
was,in doubt right
down,to the last wo
minutes.,Albert scored two touch- downs and passed for
another.,John- son contributed consistent running gains
and,
Hetsko,snared the touch- down pass from Albert that proved to be the winning margin. Before the
game,Bucknell
won,the toss and elected to receive. Hetsko took the
opening,kickoff
and,ran it back to the Bison 40. Johnson bucked up to the 44 before Albert was thrown for a loss right back to the 40. First Blood On the next play Albert broke loose after taking a handoif
on,
a,quick opener through center and
romped,60 yards to score at
1:05.,
Joe,
Mason,"converted and Bucknell led, 7-0. .\fter the Bullets returned the kick- off to their"
own,"30, Fitzkee fumbled on the first play from"
scrimmage,and Bob Davenport recovered for the Herd on the Gettysburg 35.
Van,Johnsoii ran
to,
the,"23, but Bucknell was penalized for Illegal u.se of the"
hands.,After
Gettysburg,"was caught offsides,"
Albert,
recovered,a Bullet fumble on the 31.
Then,Glenn Aspinwall pitched out to Hetsko
who,went to the
VJ,yard line.
>>,Albert
Again,' **
On,the very next play Jack
Maeby,
handed,off to .Albert
who,
scampered,
through,center for ly yards and his second
touchdown,"at 3:10 after the kickoff. Mason's placement was wide and Bucknell went ahead, 13-0."
The,Bullets took the next kickoff and ran it back to the Gettysburg 27.
From,there the Bullets
marched,57 yards to the Bucknell l(j
where,the Bison's held on downs. Hetsko then ran around left end foi a first
down.,In three plays Johnson carried to the 43 yard line where Al- bert tos.sed a long floating pass to
Het>>ko.,Hetsko caught
it,
on,the Gettysburg 30 and ran the rest of the way o paydirt at the 12:05 mark. The play covered 57
yards.,"Aspinwall's convet^ion put the Bisons ahead, 20-0 and the score remained"
unchanged,at the half as the second period failed to produce any points. Safety .Scored In the third (juarter (n-ttysburg re-

Fresh,
from,their
triumph,over a hard-fighting
Gettysburg,"eleven, the Bucknell Bisons will lide herd over to"
Allentown,Pa. this
Saturday,"afte, noon for their second football encoun- ter of the"
year.,This
game,"will be the opening tilt for a veteran-studded ""Mule"" team."
By,switching a couple of backs to center
and,
guard.,
Coach,
Howard,
Baughman,could field a starting line- up of eleven
lettermen.,
Among,these
performers,are big
George,England
whose,
throwing,
arm,
may,cause the
Orange,"and Blue considerable difficul- ty. Then too,"
Elmo,"Jackson, Harry"
Kreutzberg,
and,
Ernie,"Wescoe, all"
dangerous,"scatbacks, will put  our de- fensive line to a"
stem,test. The
Muhlenberg,line will be
manned,by last
year,lettermen
Fred,Peifley and Al
(Rubber-Arm),"Rubbert on the ends,"
Captain,
Mysto,Deitz
and,"Fred Bernian towering tackles,"
and,Bob Dikon
who,will hold one of the guard positions. Reinforcing these 1(5 upperclassmen are Jl
freshmen,
men,from the 1953
team.,Pete Dolly
from,
Camden,and
George,Mills are outstanding
among,the
new,candidates.
They,are press- ing the lettermen for  the starting as- signment. While last year's team had only oiie victory to show for the
9-game,.sched- ule which included a 32-14 loss to
B.,
"U.,",the Mules expect
to,
turn,
in,a fairly respectable
record,

Housing,"Director,"
Moose,"McCorniick, leads ail other contenders by at least a hundred or  so galleys."
And,this is no accident for the former New York Giants standout hai j been
making,"headlines since his three-letter days with the Bisons hack in 19<!""."
j,
Alway>,"a standout in football and basketball, .Moose generally needs but i a slight twisting of the arm to launch the story of how he was drafted to play buseball in his senior year. It seems the team found itself minus an outfielder just before an important road trip. The coach told two of us to go out and catch flies until one of us dropped one. Finallv the other guy dropped his and"
I,when the n?xt one came to me
I,""" At this point the dialogue trails oft' completely and Moo.se makes a violent trapping motion with both hands. ""I got eleven hits in"
two,"games,"" says"
"Moose,",
"""and","after that,"
they,"wero afraid to take me out of the lineup."" Acclaimed by many as the best pinch-hitter ever to play in organized base- ball (an honor which he frankly admits) the .Moose is constantly called on to settle disputes concerning the validity of ancient ba.seball stories."
When,"pre- vailed upon im a local radio show the other night to discuss Merkel's boner ii' the Cubs-Giants pennant race of 1914, the M<K)se went to great lengths to des- cribe the events which had caused the John"
McGraw,crew to lose the pennant.
When,he had finished the announcer (jueried him with.
"""Who",did win the World Series that year; the (iiants or the
"Cubs?""","It's a good thing the show wasn't televised, for Moose's stare would have chilled half of the audience,"
too.,"""Did you ever hear of the Giant.- playing the Cubs in a World Series?"" he"
demanded.,
When,"last seen, this announcer was digging a hole to crawl into."
Although,"nearing 70, the"
Moose,in still quite active athletically
and,is quite willing to
make,friends with anyone
who,will let him win in golf once in awhile.
When,Mr.
Hugo,
Hunchmeyer,offer- ed his services to the Bucknellian last
week,
as,
head,"prognostigator, th<<' Sports Staff was, frankly speaking, not"
much,impressed. But
when,the Staff met early Sun- day morning to scan the scores on
Red,
Brough's,
"window,",there
was,a note of awe and respect in their hush ed voices as they played their fla-sh- lights over the results of the nation's football games.
Missing,"only one prediction ( La- fayette-Fordham),"
and,"that only by one point, the eminent"
M,

Bab8,Fiedler Another year and another roster of programs coming to the students from
WVBU.,
Under,"the direction of Ed .McComsey, this semester promises to be the"
most,
outstanding,
that,the litle blue and white studio has seen. Refer
"programs,","better ads, and bet- ter cooperation are all on Ed's list of plans for the station. It looks like a stellar year so join the band wagon. The first general meeting of the ac- tives, pledges, and all those interested in"
WVBU,will be held
Thursday,night at 7:00 in
Hunt,Hec
Room.,"If you h.ive any talent in directing, dramat- ics, publicity or"
announcing,be sure to
show,
up.,For those interested in advertising
and,"engineering,"
WVBU,has a place.
Working,for the station is fun and is rewarding too. So don't forget to attend the meeting. P'raiik Fritzen has seen to it thst all the
away,football
games,will b<< broadcast over
the,
station.,
Keep,looking at this paper for the times.
Why,"Don't They . . . .? ,"
Have,"a weekly quartet program, and other"
programs,"devoted to local singing talent, or would this put"
S,few disc jockey shows in the hole? Give a half hour a week over to the fraternities and tell
them,to present their best talent.
Then,have judges pick the best

Answer,If so
go,
to,Biicknell's Guidance Center and meet Mr.
W.,
H.,Kieft wh.j
knows,more about you than you
know,about
your.self.,
What,"he does not know, he"
knows,
how,to find out. It is not that Mr. Kieft is unusually in- quisitive about the habits of Buck- nellians but the information all comes to him as part of his job as Director of Testing
of,"Bucknell's Guidance Center on Sixth Street. Relatively few Hucknellians realize the functions performed in that pleas- ant, white"
frame,hou.^e that .seems almo.st los
among,the <<ued dormitories on Sixth Street.
Some,believe it t'> be
the,"place that provides sumn'9r jobs, others have the vague idea that it is theii'"
that,
you,leceive you>' scoldings if
you,receive
any,"mid-se- mesters, but to"
many,a Bucknell sli- (lent it i.s the place where they g )t information
when,"they were confused,"
encouragement,
when,"they despaired,"
and,
a,
new,
hope,
and,confidence in iht'ir college future.
The,function of the Guidance Cen- ter is to solve the problems that the -tudent has in college. It perform 5 his function in three
ways.,First
by,giving aptitude
tests,
to,"determine v.hat vocation he is best -uited for. S""condiy, by jfiving information as to *Ahat courses to take"
and,
the,best r.-.t'thods of

was,just too efficient to be a
human,being. The less F>ank got done the more his roomie seemed to
accomplish.,
Frank,
would,run
down,to the
gymnasium,"for an hour or two,"
sometimes,"it stretched out into an afternoon, and"
when,he came back his nximie would have his days assignment
done.,"While Frank burn- ed the midnight oil trying desperately to catch up, his roomie snoozed peace- fully in his"
sack.,"After all, what could you do with a guy like that? Frank's subjects irritated him also. Hi.s family wanted him to be a lawyer like his father but the liberal art- subjects were confusing and boring. .Anyway who dared about the divorce rate in .Siberia or the"
name,of Alex- ander's horse?
Anyway,

War,"Nerves? Flank was becoming nervous, irrit- able, losing"
confidence,
in,himself.
When,an important teat
came,"along, he would go to pieces while he wa-^ taking it, forgetting"
everything,\\c. knew.
The,
day,the
midsemester,grades lanio out was a bitter one for
i>ank,l)ut in the
end,it proved to
be,tho turning point in his college career. V<u- in hi.s little talk with the dean he was advised to pay
a,visit
to,th- (juidance Center. Frank went to the Guidance Centre unly to lind that Mr. Kieft already knew a .surprising
amount,"about him. 'ill.- psychological te.st that Frank had taken during Freshman Week ended up at the Guidance Center. The test was dividt-d into three sections. One section gave Frank's autitude score in chemistry, physics, mathematics, and engineering."
Another,"section gradetl him on such subjects as English, eco- I'.omics, psychology, social studies, and other typical"
A.,B. subjects. The third .score rated P'rank in compari- son with other college students.
Headed,
Wrong,Frank discovered that while he was al)ove average in ability he has more ability in .scientific fields than thos-^ reijuired to
become,a lawyer. Frank decided to take a complete battery of tests for five dollars to determine what vocation he was best fitted for. Tlie tests showed that Frank would be most successful as a Chemical Kngi- neei.
Frank,"decided to switch his major the next semester. At Frank's request, Mr. Kieft .-ent a report of the findings to Frank's parents who when confronted with the evidence a.<( to Frank'-: *(^''#* ="

change,in vocational plans. Next an attempt was
made,to
make,
Flank's,study habits
more,efficient. It was
found,
that,
the,afternoons spent ill the
gymnasium,"or at the Bison, pleasant"
though,"strictly non- educational as they were, had to go."
A,schedule was
drawn,up that allow- ed adequate time for all required ac- tivities and enough sleep.
Frank,got
some,go<xl advice on note taking and
keeping.,His reading speed
was,in- creased to 350 words per minute from a lazy 12<> by the use of a machine called the Metronoscope. The Metron- o.scope unrolled a printed sheet at a certain speed while the reader read it.
by,speeding the
machine,up a little each
day,Mr. Kieft got
Frank,in the habit of reading faster. After sev- eral weeks
Frank,
found,his assign- ments easier to
do.,His
new,sched- ule provided him with enough time ro get everything finished that he had to
do.,
Things,
began,to look
up,for Frank. Finally
Frank,
had,
a,
number,of
talks,
with,
Mr.,
Kieft.,
Mr.,Kieft' would have called them psychotherapy but for Frank they were just a chance to get a
number,of things out of his sy.stem that were bothering
him.,Af- ter the talks he felt better. He could concentrate on his 8ubject> better be- cause his trouble-some
daydreams,no longer bothered him.
A,New Man
Frank,is a different person today.
He,is interested in his
new,course*.
He,looks forward to the day
when,lie will become a Chemical Engineer. His nervousness and irritability are gone.
There,.seems to be plenty of time in the day for everything that he needs to
do.,
He,has even found that his
roommate,is not such a bad guy after all. Frank's case is
typical,
of,
many,that the Guidance Center has handled
and,is
handling,
today.,
Mr.,Kieft looks
forward,hopefully to the day
when,every student
will,
be,tested
upon,"entering Bucknell so that edu- cational, vocational,"
and,personal
guidance,
may,be
given,
before,the
student's,
problems,
become,minor tragedies.

when,it
was,
reported,over

Upon,"further investigation he found that several classes had been inform- ed by the professor that State Police had arrested him and he was about to leave for an ""extended vacation."" State Police"
cleared,
the,mystery
when,it
was,reported that a driver with a very similar

WSGA,
meeting,
of,
this,
year,
Wednesday,night in the Baptist
Church.,"Marilyn Ruth, president of the entire women's student bcniy. and president of .Senate called the meeting to order."
Welcom,ing the
freshmen,"to their first join', meeting,"
Lyn,Ruth discus.sed the im- portance of our responsibility to the.
Honor,
System.,She explained the revised demerit
system,
and,
empha-,sized especially a more stringent ob- servation of quiet hours. The presi- dent then intrr>duced the vice presi- dent of
WSGA,
Charlotte,Stratton
who,is also chairman of the House of Representatives. (See
WSGA.,Pg. 8) that he would enforce the ruling of the Board of Trustees of the I'niver- sity. Their policy was that the p-is- #tession or use of alcoholic beverages in the fraternity houses
and,donni- tories
was,against the better inter- ests of the University.
Warning,Not \ Threat
The,president
warned,
that,any group
who,violated this policy would be 'treading on thin
ice.',
He,said that he did not mean this as a threat hut as a fair warning to all concerned. Dean of
Men,.Malcolm
K.,Mus.ser on one hand
complimented,the fraternity
men,for their definite rise in .scholar- ship and on the other reproached them because of
the,unfav<irable reports
which,
he,
had,received concerning
drinking,
at,
the,
fraternity,Open Houses.
Dean,Musser also warned the
IFC,
members,"about different rackets, rob- beries, fire hazards and other"
campu^,problems. Dean
Thanks,"Fraternities In con 'luding his address, the Dear of"
Men,thanked the fraternities as a whole for the
many,contributions of time and effort which they have given to the University.
A,motion
was,passed to the effect that an invitation be sent to the fac- ulty and
administration,
members,from the
IFC,to attend all social func- tions of the fraternities on campus.
President,
Hildreth,will
read,this
formal,invitation to the faculty a*

Life,(Editor's Note:
"""Campus","Life"" is a new column to appear each week. It deals with important issues in (he world today as they relate to the Bucknell student body.) by Konald Unger"
(OLOR.,
RKLKJIOUS,
AM),
RACIAL,
DISCRIMINATION,
AT,
BUCKNELL?,I'm sure that few if any of you
who,read this column consider yourself bigoted or
prejudiced.,I'm sure each and every one of you adheres in some form or another to the principles of personal integrity and personal equality. Yet every day in every way a great majority of the .^students on this
campus,are giving support to tho.se concepts
which,purport segregation
and,"racial, rtligious superiority by setting up certain undemocratic standards for select- ion into a group."
We,"""like to believe"" as"
Americans,living in a land of the free under
Dem-,ocratic morals and principles that we are truly
Democratic.,"Moreover, we a.s students at Bucknell University, a Christian institution, sincerely ""like to be- lieve"" that our"
campus,"presents i picture of ""little"
"Democracy""",at work. Our belief is founded in the strong faith of all free institution.-^-- the faith that say.s
men,are entitled to certain rights as
human,"beings regardless of inherent capabilities. of us are naive enougrh to think that ""equality, fraternity,"" and justice as individuals"" applies to inherited capabilities, but rather to social and moral equalness. Unfortunately for Bucknell. what we should ""like to believe"" and what is the ""truth"" are two relatively incompatible points. The truth of the mat- er is that with the exception of a few isolated cases, the fraternities on thiM"
campus,actively propagate the concept of racial and religious segregation.
Any,individual
who,"belongs to an organization which actively promotes arnl ""lives by"" the concept of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or color i.s supporting that concept him.self. regardless of personal feeling.s. In order to be fair and to obtain a fuller picture of this practice of dis- crimination it is proper to l>>Jok at the rea.xons for its continuance at our inati- (ution."
The,"first point, to"
my,knowiedxe.
made,by those
who,advocate the present fraternity system is that the Southern fraternity groups would secede from the organization if the national organization advocated and
demanded,"that every frternity place a ""nonsectarian"" clause in their constitutions. Second, it is often said and"
wi^,considerable validity that a more cohesive
homogeneous,organization is
formed,
when,"people art' of ""your"
own,"kind."" Finally, it is said that no group or individual in our"
Democracy,"has the right o tell another group or individual how he or she .""hould conduct affairs not pertaining to the former. Insofar as the first point is concerned the National Inlerfraternity Coun- cil at its"
Washington,Convention on
November,2(>. 1949
recommended,"""that"
memh<<'r,fraternities that do have seleiMive
membership,pro>isions consider this question in the light of prevailinu conditions and take such steps as the>
may,"elect to eliminate .selectivity provisions."" In other words eaCh individual fraternity has been priven the right to"
make,its choicf as its cimscience so
dictates.,
The,"policy of a particular chapter, one at Bucknell for example, should not effect the attitudes and policies of"
member,"chapters in Nashville, Atlanta, Richmond, etc. Concerninu the second arKumenI, it is true that certain advantages accrue out of usso<iatinK with people of similar reliKious and cultural backKrounds."
"However,",it is this writer's firm belief that whatever
advanlaues,"can bi* ob- tained from sectarianism, we can all be immen.sely b<<'tter citizens, better"
"""Dem-","ocrats."" and more understandinK"
human,beings by iivinjt as we
preach.,"This is a Chrislianit> which ensnares all races, creeds,"
and,colors l>>oth in our prayers in church and our every day li\injj. ({uesti<m yourself
I,Do you be- lieve that as one indixidiial von ha\e the riuht to prevent another individual from oblaininK a
happ>,life here at Bucknell because he
happened,"to be lM)rn a different color, or was conceived in a difTercnl racial"
and,religious back-
K,"round. .\s for the final point. Yes. it is true that nobody can furco a group or an individual to do something against his will, ft ha.-"" not been"
my,intention to pr<miote the belief that if we pray to
God,"to enable us to live the ""good life,"" then we must proriiotf that ""life"" ourselves. in closing."

Have,you ever wondered
why,the Kucknell
FVeshman,"is not quite as be- wildered as the usual college Freshman? Is it that he is more quick at under Btandinx college ways? No-o-o,"
FKESH.ME.N,
FIKKSIDES,are the magic formulae.
Again,"this year at these friendly gatherings of about two dozen fresh- men per Rroup, such topics as ""Soi- orities"
and,"Fraternities'', ""the Inter- national Situation"", ""Extra-Curricu-"
lar,"Activities"","
"""BudKeting","Your Time"","
and,"""Boy-Girl Relationships"" are discussed."
Each,group's discus- sion is
prompted,"by two upperclass- men, a boy"
and,"a girl, who.i^e wide- spread experience is of great aid in unraveling the"
problems,and pondev- ings of the Freshmen. .Activities Too The groups meet in the dormitories or the
homes,
of,
faculty,members. Meetings of a
more,"social nature are held in the Bison, or in the Sweet"
Shoppe.,
Hayrides,
and,Hikes have also been planned. Already .'leS
Freshmen,have signed
up.,If any other
Freshmen,
wish,"to join one of these groups, they"
may,do 80 at the

HALFTIME,"scant yards, the hapless Herd"
saw,its supreme bid in the foggy fourth quar- ter successfully stymied by a rejuven- ated 1950
Muhlenberg,eleven playing heads-up ball for 60 full minutes.
The,
Mules,released an aerial at- tack that carried
them,"to the Bison goal line three times, officially, and two other times that were nullified by offside"
penalties.,
The,Bisons came
from,behind
on,
two,different occa- sions to steal the lead and were surg- ing towards paydirt for most of the last quarter
until,
the,ubiquituous mist
and,untimely fumbles deprived them of the ball when they needed it the most
--,in the last eight minutes. Fir8t Blood It
was,
Muhlenberg's,
George,"Eng- land who dominated the scene during the Ist quarter by rifling three passes that connected to put the .Mules on the two-yard line. Elmo Jackson, the shifty"
Negro,"halfback, .-.lipped over from there to light up the scoreboard, 6-0."
The,try for the point failed as did all the Mule kicks.
The,
LawTencemen,spent the first period probing the line and keeping the Mules at bay mainly through the efforts of the center of the defen.><ive line arjd the
good,"right foot of Joe MasoD,"
who,
was,punting beautifully idiis night. Lat>t .Minute Pass The 2nd quarter
saw,the
Herd,do .some stampe<ling of its
own,as Jack
Maeby,
made,
a,"key interception and sent the hard running trio of Albert, Myers, and"
Hetsko,on
a,series of plays which ended
them,
up,
on,the
two-yard,line.
Van,
Johnson,stepped over for the tally and Glenn Aspinwall kicked the point after. Score 7-<i.
The,
Herd,
enjoyed,
only,
a,"brief respite, however, as that"
man,Eng- land tossed a long one with only 15 .<<>>econds
remaining,in the first half and connected with Ingold for a score on a play that covered 69 yards. It
was,not a
happy,Herd that left the field at the halftime.

Hetsko,"to .MiKibhin pass, putting the ball on thf"
1<).,Albert then hit for 7 and Jack
Maeby,cut beautifully over left tackle for the remaining 9 yards and a score.
The,pass
from,center was slow and low and A^pinwall's try for point
was,smothered leaving it 13-12 for our side.
Another,
long,
F^ngland,"pass, to"
Reed,"this time, set"
up,the clincher about a minute later. With the ball on the

memory,"of one of her sons, Christy"
"Mathewson,",
during,
a,brief halftime
ceremony,of the Lehigh football
game,here
Saturday,afternoon.
"Mathewson,",
one,
of,"professional baseball's immortals, died October 7, 1925, just 25 years to the day of Sat- urday's game."
His,
body,lies in the
Lewisburg,
"Cemetery,",a
few,hundred yard.s
from,the scene of his under- graduate athletic triumphs. Football first brought national fame to the
name,of Christopher
Mathew-,"son. A fullback for the Bisons from 1898 to 1900, he was one of he great- est punters"
and,field-goal specialists of that
age.,Walter
"Camp,","father of .All-.'Vmerican teams, created a posi- tiim of ""kicker"" to include .Mathewson in his 1!K)0 all-star lineup."
During,
Mathewson's,"era, the Buck- nell. T^high football"
game,wa.<>> one rtf the highlights of the season for both
teams.,It wa.t his drop-kick from the 40-yard line in 1899 that enabled the
Herd,to
triumph,over the Engineers.
The,score
was,5 to (i. Field goals
and,
touchdowns,
both,
couned,five points at that time. -Matty
made,"good on six drop kicks that season, including"
two,
from,be- hind the
25.yard,line against Penn- sylvania. He al.so
ran,
for,.seven
"touchdowns,",.scoring 65 points during the
campaign.,In 1900 against
Army,he split the uprights
from,4H yards out
and,
from,
what,
newspapers,"re- cord as ""a difficult angle."""
Mathewson,was a three letterman. .After
completing,"his junior year, he"
embarked,upon his remarkable career with the

Jeffrey,
has,"been termed by the experts as ""one of the nation's best"". Coach Joe Diblin has been working his squad overtime in an attempt to ""shape"
them,"up"" for the big encoun- ter. The"
squad,"itself is the largest in years,"
due,partly to the furious search Diblin is
making,to find men to replace those lost

wingmen.,Along
with,these

ready,"to play the goal, while Art .Sloat and Pete Lotto can give a good account of themselves at the fullback slots."

One,

Freshman,football team. The }{aby Bisons will square off with the frosh of I>>ck
Haven,State Teach- ers College in

Lanemen,have been working

AT,
BUCKNELL,
LEWISBURG.,
PA.,out for over two weeks and have been tested in
scrimmage,against the var- sity's third and fourth stringers at recent sessions.
Heavy,"leant The Frosh will field a fairly heavy eleven, the line averaging about two hundred pounds per"
man.,"Featuring, of course, a split"
T,"attack, the team should look sharp on ofTen.se, and has been drilling especially hard on de- fensive weaknesses."
Already,
some,
standouts,have ap- peared among the
yearlings.,"The passing and ball-handling of quarter- back Adamic should net ground gain- ing results, as should also the run- ning of halfback"
Dee.,
The,"forward wall, although short on tackles, will"
have,
two,terrific
guards,in Keener
and,Christiansen
and,holding dow;i the center
post,
capably,
is,Ganz.

who,"is ably assisted by ' Flavio Nardone, bemoans a lack of manpower."
With,"only about thirty ' men, the squad"
numbers,fewer play- ers than that of last year.
A,couple of early injuries cr)uld do great
dam-,\ age to the team's chances.
A,"testing schedule also threatens the succes.- of the team, which shows the Frosh of Lock Haven. Penn State, Gettysburg,"

met,on successive
weekends.,"All of these elevens will be tvet on Fridays with the exception of a Thur.sday con- tent at Gettysburg,"

THE,
BUCKNELLIAN,"Lewisburg, Pa. Dear Ed: Please inform"
your,
readers,that I'm very
much,put out about
my,mis- information of last
week.,
My,knowl- edge of Carlisle helped to
some,"ex- tent, but the weather fouled me up."
Had,"the fog not rolled in, Bucknell would surely have given the Mules a"
good,
kicking.,
Had,the
grass,"not been .so slippery, Syracuse would have beaten"
Temple.,
Same,goes for Deni- son's upset of
Washington,"and Jeffer- son (those last two fellows never did hit it off too well). Granted,"
I,
am,keeping abreast of
my,"contemporaries, but"
I,
won't,be satisfied until all
my,predictions come
true.,Right
now,
I,have just com- pleted a survey of the weather pros- pects for the
weekend.,
My,forecasts will be partly based on the results:
BUCKNELL,vs.
LEHIGH:,It's a case of
mind,over
matter.,"(Never mind, it doesn't"
matter).,
Lehigh,"i- heavily favoied, but don't count out the Bisons. They're going to put on a real"
show,for their
Dads.,

They,"tell me, too, that come the  bud- tiing of the tulips next spiing, our population will be increased"

rumor.,"Get the cigars ready, boys!"

Rolling,by
Frank,Kelly The Engineers really started rolling last
week,with three of the four so- cieties holding meetings on Thursday.
The,
ASCE,
meeting,
opened,
with,a
welcome,to the
Freshmen,
by,Mel Sheridan at which time a directory of the
CE,students was passed out to all
members,
who,were present. Following the election of Bob Bab- bitt as the
Chapter,"Treaaurer, Pro- fes-sor"
Weeden,"gave a talk on ""Cold"
Weather,
"Engineering"".",The talk was based upon his own experiences in the tundra region of Alaska while he was doing military research for the gov ernment. After the
meeting,
was,"adjourned, there"
was,
an,inspection of the
CE,labs for the
Freshmen,
and,refresh- ments were
served.,
The,
CEs,"are holding their next meeting on Thurs- day, October 12, at 4:30 in the after- noon. The"
"program,","thus far, in- cludes a movie."
The,
AIEE,opened a new year with the election of Ed
Gurdack,as repre- sentative to the
Engineering,Council and a talk by a sudent
speaker.,"Ed Prokop, Senior"
"EE,","spoke on ""Piezo- But with the road came a gravel fill"
--,And angry bulldozers pushed dirt until
--,"Our mailboxes no longer were four feet high, But buried halfway up, and that's no lie! Exclaimed a passing motorist, ""Those villagers must not be very tall!"" Retorted the defiant mailboxes, ""Just you wait"
--,"we'll grow up again this fall!"" So endeth the episode of our midget mailboxes, occasioned by the buildinf; I of the new road to Bucknell"
Farm,"and the ^'#""If ''iniiv-:!'. electric Effects"
and,
"Crystals.""",
He,told
how,"the mechanical deformation of a crystal will produce a potential difference across it or if a potential difference is applied across a crystal, a mechanical deformation will result."
Such,crystals
and,"the piezo-electri<- effect find application in radar, sonai ,"
and,
many,phases of
communication,work.
The,
ASME,
meeting,
commenced,with a greeting
by,
Don,"Betty, presi dent, who explained about the"
ASME,"and the various advantages of joinin;^ the organization. Next, the tentative"
program,for the year
was,"outlined wih stress being applied to the prac- tical viewpoint of the theory which is learned in class. This will be brought out by having various speakers, also movies, and as"
many,inspection trip-; as possible.
The,
program,concluded with the signing
up,of students foi the society and the serving of refresh- ments.

Miss Le Gallienne was educated in Paris and in London, and made her theatrical debut in the latter city in Maeterlinck's"
"""Monna",
"Vanna""","star- ring Constance Collier. Her Ameri- can debut was made in the role of a colored maid, in the .New York pro- duction of ""Mrs. Boltay's Daughters."" Not content with having founded a reperory theatre of which she was di- rector as well as leading actress. Miss Le Gallienne also e.stablished a free .school of the theatre as an adjunct of the company. Eva Le Gallienne has received many honors, among which are honorary de- grees from Tufts, Russel Sage, Smith and Mt. Holyoke Colleges and Brown University; the 192<<) Pictorial Review Prize of five housand d()llars; the gold medal of the Society"

Art,and .Sciences; and the 1934 medal of honor of the Town Hall Club of
New,"York. Her autobiography, ""At 33"", won her acclaim as a writer and attained the be.'it-scller class in non-fiction. .Now, coming with her own company in ""Great Scenes From Great Plays"", Iva Le Gallienne proves again, in an evening of brilliant acting, to be one of the most exciting performers of our time. An excellent"
campany,"of out.standing Broadway players such as Kendall Clarke,"

country.,
The,
American,"Red Cross, now official hlfM>d collector for Uncle Sam. is currently conducting Blood-Mobile drives throughout the"
country.,This service is vital not only for our
armed,"forces,"
but,for civilian defense and home purposes a.s well. Many colleges and universities have turned in admirable records in this worthwhile effort --
now,"Bucknellians have been asked to cooperate. .Mr. Harold Hayden, Blood Donor chairman, has enlisted"
Alpha,"Phi Omega, our newly chartered service fraternity, with the aid of other stu- dents, to conduct the Blood-.Mobile campaign on our"
campus.,
BUT,"in order to be successful, this project must have the support of every mem- ber of our university faculty, admin- istration and student body. Your support will be greatly appre-"

Postponements,
Given,
Draftees,"The .Selective Service Act of 1948 requires that draft boards postpone the induction of students who receive their induction orders after the be- ginning of the present academic year, George"
R.,"Faint, registrar, explained today. Bucknell -tudents who are carrying full-time courses are thus entitled to postponement for this academic year if they want it, Mr. Faint said, pro- vided their induction orders came af- ?ei the leginmng of the school term. Those who want to take advantage of this mandatory provision of the Selective Service Act must take two -teps, the registrar continued. First, they themselves must request this postponement from their draft board. The University cannot do it for them. Second, they must ask the Univers- ity to certify to the draft board that they are pursuing a full-time course and that they are making satisfactory progres.'S. The Veterans' Information Office in"
Room,"109 West Wing, Roberts Hall, will handle this latter procedure for the students who"
want,
to,"request postponement, Mr. Faint added. The mandatory provision of the Se- lective Service Act is as follows:"
"""Any","person who, while satisfac- torily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution of learning, is or- dered to report for induction under this title, shall, upon the facts being presented to the local board, have his induction under this title postponed (A) until the end of such academic year or (B) until he ceases satisfac- torily to pursue such course of in.- (See"

We,

We,
showed,
them,
that,

Don't,
believe,
the,

who,
say,
that,

more,

than,
we,
did.,
After,all.
they,
had,
more,
students,
there,
than,
you'd,
think.,
And,
its,
rumored,
that,
their,

don't,

to,
be,
heard,
repeating,
>illy,
cheers,
and,
singing,
funny,
songs.,\\'*'re
above,all
that.,
Probably,
the,
biggest,
thing,
we,
showed,
our,
Dads,
was,
that,
we,
respect,
our,
"cheerleaders,",
our,
"band,",
and,
our,
coaches.,
Of,
"course,",
we,
don't,
actively,

But,
we,

I,n^er Unfortunately no one thought enough of
my,challenge of last week to .sit
down,and answer my
comments,"upon the very important issue of di.>criniina- Jion here. Huwever. during the cour4<< of the week,"
my,
many,conversations with fellow students raised several pertinent question.* a<< to the intent of last week's aricle and the nature of its proposition. I'm quite sure that
many,students have felt that this writer chose an entirely unsuitable time for brinKiny before the students on
campus,the i^ue of racial and relini'ms discrimination at
Hucknell.,
Some,have probably in< terred that
my,intent >>>as lo weaken the status of the fraaernilie> on
campiw,before
rushinn.,Some undoubtedl> feel that
I,"^m a rabble rouser who thinks he can reform the world. However, till.* i.s not the case. Ks.-<<entiaUy, there ai-e two reasons for"
my,writing .<<uch an article.
I,"believe that if we an* not to be considered liypocrites in the eyes of the world, and in the eye* of our fellow Americans, *'en we must actively practice this thing called"
Democracy.,
I,can't help but ..Ilk what a wonderful
propaganda,point for the Ku.stians that
America,"is not the land of equality, but the land of >>cgregat:ii.ii; that"
America,pri>duce.s ?uch systems as difu-i iininatiiig fraternal organizatioaa. Visualize American Status in the eyes of the rrst of the world as th<<
U.,8.
S.  R.,proclaims .\meriran hypocrisy.
We,"spend billion^ tryinjj to pre- serve Democracy in Kurope. .\sia. etc.. but in our own backyard, we leave our- selves open lo serious attack. .\s"
I,"hav .* noted the fraternitv sv stem of di*- cnmination forms a segment upon which that attack is made. In the .second place,"
I,feel that
my,fellow students should be fully aware that this issue is something to think about and dl.scuss with other students and the faculty.
The,"importance of being aware caniiot be over-emphasiied, be- cause there is a resolution pending before the Buckm-ll interfratemity c.uncil on this very issue. At a meeting held on"
May,1. 1980. one fraternity on cam- pus made the following
recommendation:,"""That the Bucknell Interfratemity Council, in the light of Bucknell's heritage of"
American,
democracy,"and Chri.st- lan principle, adopt a policy favoring the abolition of all racial and religiou-i *.scnmination in ail fraternal groups on the Bucknell campus."" 'This"
recommendation,Krew out of the resolution paMe<l by the National Interfratemity Council at its
Washington,Convention on
November,2<<. 194>> stating first:
"""Many",
member,fraternities have had and
now,"have restrictive provisions"": second. ""The question is of concern to"
many,"iaterested partieV : third, ""Fraternity"
membership,is an individual responnihility-; fourth.
"""Mem-",ber fraternities that do have selective
membership,proviai<<>><< should consider this question in the lixht of prevailing conditions
may,"elect to eliminate selectivity provisions."" This resolution wa. pas.sed by a standing vote with the count of 36 affirm- ative, u negative, and ly abstaining. In short, considerable authority rests in the hand, of local chapters. Thus,"
I,"feel that fraternity, non-fraternity, and future fraternity men sh..uld be well aware of the facts in order that ignor- ance cannot"
W,u^ed as excuse for fraternitv actions
C,"oncerninK the nature of the last article's proposition,"
I,feel that
I,have
made,"m>self quite clear. | believe and shall contimie to believe that fr.temi- t.e> which contain clauses that di.scriminate'on the basw of race, religion, ar and take such steps as they rs as promoting .segregation by action, hot color serve to brand their"
memhe,necesHarily by personal belief.
My,challenge still stands.
I,welcome all articles regardless of their fav- .rableness or adversity.
I,"am of the firm coaviction that this issue is close to every student's heart and as such, every .student should h Fd. Note: .Send"

Ed,Mc-

Tom,"Motheral,"
former,"assistant di- rector, were conducting their regular 11:00 to ] 1 :.30 disc jockey pvogiam. It was during this same evening that"
Kd,suggested that they
change,the
program,
and,ask for requests from their Bucknell listening audience. The requests
came,"in so fast, that"
Tom,suggested they stay on the air until he 'bitter end' to fulfill all orders for that
evening.,It wasn't until 3:30 early the next
morning,that all tho requests were played over
WVBU.,So succes.sful was the idea that
Ed,and

Victory,by Clyde
McAvoy,LehiRh's Coach
Leckonby,^ot together 35 assorted Engineers last .Satur- day and bruuKbt them up to
Memorial,
Stadium,to Rive the Bisons a little in- iitruction in hiRher mathematics.
The,lesson
went,
something,like this; If Buckiiell has 14 first
downs,and Lehigh uiily has 1> -- that doesn't mean a thing; If Buc'knell gets 134 yards rushing
and,
Lehigh,gets
only,70
--,
That,doesn't
mean,
anything,either; If Bucknell
completes,10 passes and
Lehigh,
connects,for only 7
--,That's immaterial. But if Lehigh gets 27 points on the scoreboard and Bucknell gets only 6
--,That equals one ball
game,and that's just
what,
Lehigh,
took,
hon>e,"with them. Heralded as one of the most impor- tant games for both teams, the high strung Bisons"
fumbled,
the,"ball, in every sense of the word, to send the"
Brown,and
White,eleven
home,with their third win of the campaign. Mason Masterful The one bright spot on  an otherwise black
Saturday,
was,the hard-hitting defensive talents of Joe
"Mason,","who added to an already impressive punt ing average a sterling performance at ""backer up. Then, too, the whole center of the defensive line must claim"
some,"fame for the hard running Engineers made only minus yardage there, due mainly to the work of Kirby, Duplicki, Daven- port. Light, and Young. Both aides broke out in a rash of fscoring in the first (|uarter that had the Dad's"
Day,fans
jumping,in the aisles.
Meyers,Scores
Bob,.\lbert intercepted one of Ga. briel's aerials on the
Lehigh,35 and returned it to the
24.,Bob then hit two gaping holes on the Szabo-Pechu- lis side of the line to put the ball on the
9.,
Meyers,
took,it
over,from there for the Herd's only tally. As- pinwall missed the point. It
was,right after that
--,within a matter of 60 seconds
--,that the speedy visitors unleashed a lethal 1-2 scoring punch to put the count at 14-6. Then Schaeffer ran back a punt 77 yards to set up the first
TD,and a Weiss pass to Dauntless Dick
Doyne,set up the next one for Gabriel after the Lawr- *encemen had lost the ball on a fumble
on,their
own,
31.,Trillhause convert- ed both times. Theii- second quarter .score came on another
Weiss,
"pass,",
this,
time,to Haines in the end
zone.,The kick for point
was,
wide.,
The,Bisons' own scoring threats were broken up by in- terceptions in
Lehigh,"territory. Near .Mihh The third quarter saw the Herd, un- der direction of Dean, put on its two most sustained drives of the ball"
game,only to lo>e the ball again on another
fumble,and a
pass,interception by Lehigh's Moyer who went the distance for their 4th and final
TD.,Trillhause
made,"this one good. In sum,"
the,
game,
was,lost on fumbles and too-short passing as the offensive team lost the ball 12 times

This,will be the first Middle At- lantic Conference
game,"for the Soc- cermen this year, and if reports from the locker room mean anything. Coach Diblin's hooters will be out to show that they can handle"

AT,
BUCKNELL,by Belber Robinson Bucknell's
Bouncing,Bunnies
know,
why,
Penn,State
was,last year's co-
champions,of the
nation.,
The,Blue
and,
White,added the
Herd,to their list of victories by a resounding 11-2 score Saturday at North F'ield before a
huge,Dad's
Day,gathering.
Andy,"Shirk,"
center,"forward, and"
Bob,"Diedoif, inner left, each tallied for the Bisons in the second period. But all honors for scoring"
must,go to
States,Joe
l.ane.,"Joe,"
an,All-
Ameiican,"scoring ace from Baltimore, kicked and headed in seven goals! If ever Bucknellians were to witness a"
one-man,"show,"
the,
one,
staged,by
Lane,
was,just
about,
tops.,"Lane,"
along,
with,
another,All-American
Hairy,Little
and,Buss were respon- sible for the total of eleven counters
knocked,in
by,
the,
Nittany,"Lions. Buss hit the nets thrice, while Little had a solo score. Sate led 7-2 at halftime, thanks to Lane'> smashing the cords four times."
The,Herd's Diedoif
powered,a shot off of a State fullback for one of the
Orange,
and,
Blue's,"markers, while Shirk"
came,cutting across on
an,in- direct kick to toe in the Herd's second and final goal.
The,line play of
Coach,lefT JelT- eries' team and the educated foot and head of Lane were just too
much,for the inexperienced Herd. State's short pa.-sing
game,
was,
"superb,",while
Coach,Diblin's
halfbacks,
and,full- backs did a grand job*-in booting the ball
down,the field or to a wing^man. The Bison spirit was high throughout the contest and  the boys never stop- ped fighting until the final whistle was
blown.,
The,
Diblinmen,
might,have lost the
game,"but they never lost their pep or fight,"
and,if they play their remaining
games,with that
much,/.est
and,"vigor, the"
teams,"in the .Middle Atlantic Conference are going to find out the hard way that the Herd means business. This was the first contest for both teams, but it"
was,not
a,Conference
game.,The Herd has been
champs,"of he .Middle Atlantic Conference two of the last three years,"
and,the other year they were runners-up. This was the first
time,
a,Penn State soccer team has vrsited the cam pus since 1942.
and,
by,the type of play
shown,"here by this veteran out- fit, they seem to be a good bet to gain national"
fame,and honors again this season. The
Bouncing,
Bunnies,will play host to
"Washington,",Friday at North Field. at 3:.'}0. Pos.

The,Bison Gridders will travel to the lair of a revenge-minded opponent
when,the
Herd,
engages,
Washington,and Jelfenson this
Saturday,"night at Washington, Pa. Last season the"
Herd,ripped into the Presidents to the tune of 62-0 at
Memorial,
Stadium.,
W&J,
has,not forgotten.
They,will be out to give the Herd a surprise package.
Meanwhile,the Bisons will try to get their sinking ship back on an even keey after dropping two straight con- tests following
the,
opening,season win over Gettysburg. Aerial Accuracy This week the
Orange,"and Blue has put heavy concentration on blocking, pass defense"
and,aerial-accuracy in an attempt to return to winning ways. Bucknell
and,
W,
&,
J,
have,faced each other 18 times in a series which began
way,back in 1901.
The,
Herd,has not fared too well against the Presidents.
W&J,has
captured,11 tussles while the Bisons
have,taken six. One
game,ended in a tie.
"However,",the
Bucknell-W&J,seriei has followed a definite
pattern.,In the first ten
engagements,
W&J,
won,nine and tied
one.,Bucknell did not beat
W&J,until 1931
when,the
Herd,"tiiumpher, 10-6. But since 1932 the Bisons have"
come,out
on,
top,"five times while losing twice, thus"
making,an attempt to
keep,the series from being >o lopsided. BisonH
Up,In recent years the
Red,and Black tide of
W&J,has
ebbed.,Last sea- son's two wins
against,
six,losses reached a new low and
W&J,"students feel that the situation can't get any worse, herefore it"
must,
get,better. Since the
appointment,of a new ath- letic council at the college there has been a
noticeable,
improvement,in spirit. * tllllllltttMKI * *iltlltdlllllKII* Off To

ALFHi:i),Last
week,Notre
Dame,and Bucknell lost a football
uame.,"And so did Alfred, probably."
We,don't
know,"what happened at Alfred, but the newspapers tell us that the students at South Bjiid turned out to give their"
team,
a,"demonstration that was as bin if no; bi;,-tr than the ones they vcave in victory."
What,"happened at Lewisburg wasn't in the newspapers fortunately. Mo!*t of the campus, it seems, took the loss as a personal"
insult.,".Some were not satisfied to yell at the coaches during the game to put in this or that play, er. but actually took it upon themselves to confront the pla>ers on"
campus,with the mistakes the> thought had been made and the general conduct of the game in general. But we re not going to dwell on this except to say that it's covered pretty well on the editorial
page.,Saturday
morning,the
Team,will leave to play
W,ashington & Jefferson. There won't be anybody at the send-off to take roll. But the
Team,will Iw there and they'll
know.,And so will you when you read the score .
Amen.,

Registration,
Policy,
Explained,by
Frank,Kelly
The,highlight of the past week's engineering activities
was,a talk b)
John,
T.,
West,"Jr., Secretary of the Pennsylvania Society of Professional Engineers,"
sponsored,
by,"the Engi- neering Council. Jim Hunt, senior ChE and president of the Council, introduced .Mr. West"
who,
spoke,
on,"""Registration"
--,
Why,
and,
"How""",as pertaining to the pro- fessional engineering classification granted
by,the states.
He,told how the policy of registration is a unified attempt to put
engineering,
on,the
same,professional level as medicine and law.
Through,the registration of all en- gineers and
their,
resultant,"action under a code of ethics and set stand- ards, it"
would,
be,"possible to ""(1) stop the practice of engineering by the non-engineer, (2) stop the misap- propriation and abuse of the designa- tion 'engineer', (3) oust from the pro- fession those"
who,prove incompetent
and,
unworthy;,
and,"(4) preserve to the (jualified engineer his rights of practice against restriction, encroach-"
men,"and unqualified competition"". He also brought out the fact that"
many,engineering phases
are,
not,legally
sound,unless
approved,"or done by a registered engineer. .Although .Mr. West's talk mainlv concerned the seniorH, it certainly gave all the students present a con- seen in the"
V.,
was,
John,"Williamson and family, formerly of 47-0, who now live in Lowvilie, \."
"V.,",where John is teaching school.
Sherm,"Doebler,"
a,
villager,from
"""away","back"""
who,"left in 49, has re- cently been"
Fritz,Stauffer's chief
boarder.,
The,
Texaco,station at Rt. 15 and
Market,St. is
now,"in Sherm' iiands. Said Sherm: ""I've had enough Giv.^ <<>>f the"
Mk,city ( PhiladL-iphia)
m:,"the oountiy anytime!"" Crete idea of the importance of main- taining their profession as the safe* guard of life, health and property."
Any,senior engineers
who,
may,b<< interested in the history and proced- ure of registering should .see this au- thor. I have
some,literature on the subject and .some
mimeographed,poat cards requesting a copy of the Penn- sylvania Registration Act and an ap- plication for Certificate as
an,Engi- neer-in-Training. Registration a>> an Engineei-in-Training in Pennsylvania requires neither
a,resident's status nor an entrance examination. The opening meeting of the
AIChB,
on,October
2nd,included three short movies; one being a
March,of
Time,film on atomic eneigy.
Ed,
Yancavage,
was,chosen as the
Junior,representative for the Engi- neering Council at that
meeting.,
The,
ChE,plans for the
immediate,future are centet-ed
around,"a banquet, ten- tatively scheduled for"
November,"I5th,"
The,banquet
committee,has been or- ganized under Dick Weiner. Sixteen
members,of the senior
EB,class
made,the trip to the
AIEE,"con- vention at Baltimore on October 4th,"
I,
They,attended several of the lecture* given in the
morning,and went on an inspection trip to the Glen
L.,Martin plant in the
afternoon.,"Due to secur- ity restrictions,"
the,
inspection,trip
was,not so interesting as it was ex- pected to be. Last
Friday,
"a^rnoon,",the
ASCE,
showed,a movie for its
members,on the
Fontana,
"Dam,",one of the project* of the
TVA.,Dick Painton previewed the film and briefed the group on the points of interest before the filni was
shown.,
A,discussion of the construc- tion followed the film.

Ciiapel,"""The government >>ihould regulate, not control businesH."" Haid Mr."
H.,
W.,"Prentis. Jr.. before the chapel audience yesterday. Mr. Prentis, chairman of the Board of Directors of Armstrong Cork Co., stated that if free competitive busine88 is to survive, business men must realize their responsibilities to raise the standard of living, improve working condition.s, and develop other neces- sary standards. Speaking to a large audience, Mr.* Prentis pointed"
out,that economic freedom is a part
of,the soul of
America.,
He,emphasized the fact that the system of free competitive business has pioduced a standard of living never before reached by any nation. In establishing his
second,"point, that private competitive business has placed more goods at the hands of moie people"
than,
ever,"before, Mr. Prentis, refuted three well-known ar- gruments against big-business. Speak- ing from his experience he told the audience that the element of competi- tion among the big companies made it virtually impossible for them to re- sort to collusion to ""fix prices."" ""Manufacturers do not hold down production to force higher prices,"" he continued, ""for to do so would mean that overhead expenses would pile up"
"immeasurably.""","In answering the charge that business is making excess profits, Mr. Prentis pointed out that manufacturers make less"
than,"six cents on the dollar without paying dividends and other expenses. Illustrating the evils of compulsory planning, Mr. Prentis made his third point."
He,"said that under compul- sory planning in other nations, free- dom of the press, academic freedom, freedom of worship and other free, doms vital to most Americans."

an,"applicant should exhibit good breeding, intelli- gence, .a desire to do hard work, and the ability to get along with people. All the speakers emphasized the fact that Job applicants must have speaking and writing p.oficiency in Kngli- # Fraternity rushing rules similar to today's began in 1931. Can you men"
imagine,
having,only
a,two-hour period of silence to decide which was the one for
you?,"That's the way the rule ran in 1931. In these days rushing began Friday morning at 7:30 and continued until 4:0C p. m. the following Thursday at which time a two-hour period of si- lence was observed by the freshmen. (What deep meditation must have re- sulted!) At 6:00 that evening the freshman was to go to ""the house of his choice."" At the present time, a silence is observed by the fieshmen all day Sunday. Another rule laid down by Senior Council in that year is still in effect. ""A fraternity could bid a freshman, at any time during rushing season, but there could be no formal accept- ance of the bid."" According to one professor's mem- ory, prior to this time the freshmen were rushed the moment they hit the station. (Must have been a tense few days). This probably is what caused the above change in rules. In 1931, fifteen fraternities compet- ed for the ""cream of the freshmen crop"" and gained 183"
men.,"(How- ever, this number also included upper- classmen). That year was a week's delay in the rushing season due to an Infantile Paralvsis .scare."

^ress,
Thanks,
For,
Conference,
Exp],by Don Ray Bucknell University'.-^ first Career Conference ended
on,"a very .suc- cessful note according to Ray Irwin, Director of"
the,"Placement Bureau. Nunierf>u.s letters from various repre eentative.s who were here to talk at the Conference have come into th.j Placement Bureau, each expre.'isin^: thanks for the fine showing of Buck- nell students and for the fine manner in which the Conference was run off. The speakers represented here at Bucknell were exceptional in every sense of the word. Each one pre.-jciited a clear, preci.se, picture of what his particular industry or orjfanization was looking for and wanted. One of the best speakers heard was Joseph"
W.,"Bird, Manager of the College Re- lation* and .Special Recruiting Divis- ion of the Radio Corporation of Amer- ica. Mr. Bird expressed what he had to say in a witty, yet forceful manner emphasizing the need for students to start training; now, in college, for in- tended vocations."
He,"suggested six main points for students to follow in relation to job getting. One, know how to read, write and spell accurate- ly. Two, know yourself and your de^ sires fully. Three, read about people who were successful, p'our, practice being yourself and five, know how to think clearly and precisely."
*,"General Carpenter, a graduate of Hucknell in 1927 and a graduate of Drew TheoloKical Seiniiiaiy, spoke on the subject, ""It Can Happen Here."""
Using,the examples
of,"ancient Crt'cce and Home as well as France, Ceneral Carpenter said ""Relaxation of personal life and standards can cause greater"
damage,"to the nation than fconomic troubles."" He emphasized the tremendous responsibility re.sting on the shoulders of college students to assume leadership in the world. The speaker implored students to direct their interests at institutions capable of developing"
the,"highest type or leadership and the highest moral and individual standards. ""If this does not occur,"" he said, ""we may have fewer cultural leaders in the fu- ture and may find that our real lead- ership is lacking."" The speaker stat- ed that the principles of honesty and honor must"
be,fostered
in,"young people if we are to assume the re- sponsibility  of world leadership. General Carpenter pointed out that the military is attempting to develop character guidance programs, having realised ihe shortcomings of previous military programs. Educational pro- grams in the armed forces have also been broadened to encourage leader- ship. In closing he illustrated that ""It can happen here"" when he told of the evils of communism and just how com- munism had been able to infiltrate into other seemingly strong nations. He asked the audience to face up to the respon.<<lbilities facing the youth <if Anierica."

He,
Says.,It would be tragic for
America,if one class of people were to gain exclusive control of her institutions of
higher,learning. President
Horace,
A.,Hildreth told the
Pennsylvania,Association of Collegev and Universities at a recent meeting at Hotel Hershey.
Questioning,the
wisdom,"of in- vesting control over higher edu- cation in the hands of college fac- ulties, which represent persons of"
only,
one,
type,"of training. Dr. Hildreth declared that ""ultimate"
policy,
decisions,
in,connection with our great universities should
be,
made,
by,
a,representative group of the
American,"public."" In discussing the issues involved in the furor created by the oaths of non- communist afifiliation required of fac- ulty members at the University of California, the former governor of Maine stated that the real question is one of authority and not one of aca- deniii' freedom. Real Is.sue ""The real issue on California has no been"
freedom,
of,"teaching but whether or not those vested with the legal authority for the management ""f an institution should"
have,"the right to impose their authority upon 'he faculty,"" Dr. Hildreth said. While the majority of thoughtful Americans may think that the regenti erred in re<)uiring such ""'an unneces- sary and ineffective statement,"" thi- college administrator pointed out, ""the power to make policy decisions jnust reside somewhere."" ""In  the case of a difference of opin ion between the thinking of faculties and the thinking of those in whom th-- legal responsibility for  the manage- ment of institutions has been placed, my own definite opinion is that the legal authorities should h-jve the final say."" Fuzzy Faculty The true cause of academic freedom has sufl'ered more from ""the distorted lamentations of fuzzy-minded preudo- intellectuals"" than from ""the unwis- dom, if not the stupidity,"" of the re- gents of California who imposed the oath upon the University faculty. Dr. Hildreth declared. ""It is regrettable that the issue of .uademic freedom and free teaching has been confused by the public dis- cussion of fuzzy-thinking and over- sensitive intellectuals who are really complaining only about the imposition of legal authority on faculties."" he continued. ""By that public lamentation, these over-sensitive intellectuals have done irreparable injury to a great Univer- sity, where few really doubt that aca- demic freedom exi.sts. Due to the confusion of issues, they have made large portions of the public believe that our institutions of higher leacn itig are filled with those interested ii: at least having he right to teach com- munism,"" Dr. Hildreth added."

Rushing,
Season,

'Joe,
Frosh,
',
And,
Frat.,
Men,.Amid scores of well-dressed upper- classmen gazing through
sleepy,"eyes, the male members of the fresh- men class awoke .Monday moining to face a barrage of fraternity men as rushing season began. Precisely at 7 a. m. Monday morn- ing the battle was on a.> members of"
the,"thirteen fraternities dashed through the portals of rooms housing bewildered freshmen, vieing for the honor of inviting ""Joe Frosh"" over to the house for"
dinner.,"For a half- hour preceding the 7 o'clock deadline the dorms were a beehive of activity as upperclassmen met to hold laflHes for position in the rushing line. Interfraternity rushing rules speci- fied that the oldest man present would conduct the raffle and several fiats were humorously accu.<<ed of bringing founders back for  the raffle. How- ever, the raffles proceeded according' to plan and most were completed at 6:45, the time set for the raffle by 1."
F.,
C.,Approximately twenty-six hundred meal dates will take place during tine week with countless numbeis of smok- ers and other rendevous' thrown in for good
measure.,"Each man was signed for two meals, one lunch and one dinner, and in many cases break- fasts were taken."
One,"fraternity man, evidently as sleepy as the man he wa.-< after, sign- ed the rushee for four"
meals.,"His successor in the line was quick to de- tect the error and aftei- cries of ""dirty rushing"" had calmed down, the mis- take was rectified. Fraternities were exceptionally busy as rushing chairmen barked orders and dispatched men to escort likely prospects to the house. Bushing lit- erature was di-tributed heavily among the rushees in an attempt to famili- arize them with the fine points of each house. Actives were on their best behavior to impress ""Joe"
"Frosh"".","Cigars, cigarettes, sandwiches, cokes and other refreshments were shoved their way in an effort to prove that fra- ternity life and food couldn't be sur- passed. Of course, rushing wouldn't be com- plete without"
the,evening rushing meeting and the walking phantoms (fraternity men) on campus this week are results of the.se meetins. Most of the houses were active until the wee hours of the morning finishing the day's business. Rushing will officially end this Sat- urday evening following the fratern- ity smokers. Under I.
F.,
C.,"rules, no fraternity shall pledge"
men,until
Monday,
morning.,"Of course, the perennial rumor that one fraternity has already held pledge class elec- tions has made the"
rounds.,Which fraternity? No one has been able to find out yet.
Religion,
Classes,
Given,
At,
The,
Pen,.Adding to their already busy sched- ule. Dr. Charles
M.,"Bond, head of the department of Religion, and Dr."
L.,"Elbert Wethington, assistant profes- sor of Religion, are instructing classes in religious education at the .North- eastern Federal Penitentiary. Rev."
A.,
E.,"Kannwischer, has prepared this program which is the first of its kind of religious education that has been undertaken as part of the total school curriculum on such a large scale in the Federal Prison system. Dr. Bond is teaching a course en- titled, ""The Bible, the Book of Life"", which is an attempt to help the class understand the Bible as the world's greatest textbook of morals and re- ligion. Dr. Wethington is instructing a class on"
"""The","Christian Faith -- Foundation of Life"", which consists of an interpretation of the fundamental teaching of he Christian faith. Rev."
A.,
K.,"Kannwischer is also teaching a course on ""Christ, the Life of Life"", which is an interpretation of the per- son and work of Jesus.- These courses have been received with great enthusiasm and have had an attendance of approximately 80 persons. The election of the.se courses by the inmates of the Penitentiary is entirely voluntary hut is considered by the authorities as being quite sat- isfactory for the beginning of such a program. <s III tilm I'll I"

LEARNING?,Few. if any of us. during the course of our four years ever stop to give seriou.s thought (o the full meaning of the word
Bucknell--,"University. Most of us have a >ague, fuz/y idea of the surface distinction between colleges and universities. To some, a University is a place, which offers cour.ses above the under- graduate level, thu.s distinguishing it from a college. In the other hand, there are a few who believe that the essence of a University as distinguished from cclleges. high schools, etc., transcend.s this mere superficial distinction. These people believe that the life-blood of a University is the essential respect of every individual for the rights and privileges of his fellow man."
I,"believe that higher education, has its central point of value the growth of character through the art of learning how to use one's"
mind,"in the project of thinking. Certainly, of the very heart of one's growth of character is the development of a personal morality, a personal integrity which"
stamps,"you as an individual to be respected. I'm .-^ure that most of u.s are in pursuit of this thing called personal integ- rity. We attend our church of preference on Sunday, and we pray to God to give us the strength and the courage to lead good lives. Yet, during the fol- lowing week as many as 99''^ of us who have given our hearts to fkxi, violate the very beliefs that we established. Yes,"
I,"would venture to say that 99""' of our students"
have,
during,the course of their lives cheated on an
examination.,"In high school it was consid. ered the vogue by our fellow students to get the best grades in the best way possible. .Now. we are in college and our main worries are whether or not we shall get into the best profes.sional school, or obtain"
a,
high,
paying,"job. Once again too many of us in our maturing years at Bucknell University have not taken slock of anything else but how to get the highest grades and still do the lea.st work pos.sible. In following this motto, we have found it convenient to cheat on an examination. The heck with building character. The heck  with learning"
how,to think
honestly.,All we're worried about is
how,
many,
Q.,"C.'s we can accumulate during our four years at this institution of ""higher"
"learning.""","In our bull sessions, in our churches we profess the inherent integrity of man and his gift of reasonwhich serves to promulgate that"
integrity.,
"However,",
we,"should rather .sell all those high-sounding phrases and words up the river, if it means that we won't make Dean's List, or we will flunk a course. In answer to the accusation that ""you have cheated on an examination."" l>eople often remark, ""I saw others doing it, and"
I,don't think it is fair that he should do belter than I'
.,"Here, we have the crux of the situation. The great emphasis at Hucknell University lies in the achievement of"
markn.,"In propor- tion to this emphasis, relatively little spotlight is played upon he true essence of a University which"
I,noted
above.,"Nobody is worried about personal integ. rity, if it means doing poorly. The result of the keen competition which we"
wage,for the best grades to get the highest honors is that Bucknell no longer resembles a University in the true .^ense of the
word.,"The feeling of essential respect for every person's rights and privileges has become virtually eatant. of us appear to realize that when wr go out into the world, we may possibl.v achieve our job, our status by our grades and extra-curricular work. iji However, once we gain the job we keep it by our own personality, our own abil- *j ity and trustworthiness. If we maintain the true eKsence of a University, we"
I,shall  build within ourselves the l>pe of chantrter neccMsary to maintain our I work status and our personal status in everyday living. People will look up
I,to us as individuals who live as they pray and
speak.,
"Furthermore,",we shall
3,be promoting in our every action the belief In the inherent integrity and re- 5 spect of man.
Letter,
to,
the,
Editor,"October 12. 1950 To the Kditor: Subconsciously, associations form In the"
mind,which vitally afTect our moral and therefore our very exist- ence. By
past,
experiences,
many,"people associate long diner tables with lumber canips,"
etc.,"Subconsciously, small dining table.^"
are,"associated with companionship at home, etc."
The,dining hall has taken an en- couraging step
forward,
with,the
"""rainbow",
"room"".",But --
why,sanction the use of quarters unrepresentative of the dining hall for the use of u.se- less
committees?,Except for occa- sional meetings
of,"certain alumni groups,"
and,"the like, which support the college"
endowment,and other vv-ise benefit
the,school--
why,
are,any
groups,granted special privileges to any part of the dining hall? For two years
I,have watched such group.s meet
and,see no results for the independent men on
campus.,On that basis
--,let those groups go where the re.sults of their activitie.<< thrive.
Some,college inve.^tment
in,the
atmosphere,at the men's dining hall would do wonders
to,build
up,the moral and even possibly .school spirit. In passing let a definition of heaven

L.,October 16. 1950 To the Kditor:
Why,don't Bucknell students take advaiitage of the
dance,floor at the
Bison?,This question has been posed
many,"times, but"
I,"have yet tf> hear ;i sat i.-< factory answer. ""Becau-te it ju.n isn't done."" is the response heard"
most,"often, but"
why,isn't it
done?,
Dancing,at the Bison would be a golden opportunity for fel- lows to meet girls
and,get to know
them,"ra.^ually rather than to rely on sly giances oTer booth-tops to see'K out a date for the weekend. Physically,"
the,
Bison,is
an,"ideal place in which to dance because the floor is smooth and spacious, and yet in the history of the establishment pn)hably not"
more,than a few dozen people have had the courage to take
advanUge,of this fact. If it v^'ould be too daring to dance right out
in,
broad,
daylight,"where everyone could see you, then"
why,at least don't
students,
use,
the,dance floor in the evening
when,
it,
is,as p<<j<<)rly lit as

became,interested in hypnosis
when,
he,saw
a,demon- stration in Danville.
He,stated that
anyone,
who,
studies,
hypnotism,can practice it. It is
very,
handy,
when,used in therapy and as a pain reliever in dentistry. Mr.

department,reviewed
the,first two chapters for the
group.,The primary (questions raised were:
What,type of college is
Bucknell?;,
What,are the duties of this type of school?;
How,does Bucknell stand up in a survey of its class of school ? Dr. Smith noted that
through,his- tory three basic types of universities
have,
developed.,
The,earliest was classified as
the,
Christian,Hellenic University
where,the stress
was,on the cultures.
The,
automatic,by-pro- duct of this type of schooling was the philosophical leader. The schools of- fered personal tutoring with a strict systematic curriculum.
The,"Liberal University, which lays its foundation in research and learn- ing for the sake of learning, was the next to"
develop.,It was through this school that the freedom of the faculty
and,of the
student,
was,developed. Here we find the university taking a neutral position to avoid the contro- versial issues of the day. Finally
came,the rise of the Tech- nological-Democratic U n i v  e r .#> i t y where science captured culture.
Too,Casual The point was brought out that our present type of college has tended t* take a casual
approach,to the prob- lems of the
immediate,
times.,The colleges do not
sene,"the needs of the student.' by giving guidance, helping set up principles of value.*, and mod- ernizing our concepts."
The,schools are
producing,"special- ists Instead of the ""well-rounded stu- dent"". .Sir"
Moberly,
mentions.,The discussion group slated that the rea- son for this is due to the pressure on grades and the strict curriculum set
by,
the,
universities.,
The,solution could be in
keeping,the enrollment small in order to aid the in->tructors in putting
themselves,across to the students.
The,school should become a
community,
at,
the,departmental level as well as at the student level.

OF,

The,
"""Phenomenon","of Fraternities"""
was,the subject of a discussion held in Student
Church,
in,
Hunt,Living ko<jm last
Sunday,evening. First speaker
was,John
M.,"Brown,"
member,of the
department,of Psy- chology at
Bucknell.,Mr.
Brown,"spoke on fraternities, and, in a broad- er sense, social institutions as a whole, from the psychologist's point of view."
The,student audience
was,told that the original
purpose,of fraternities was fellowship with people of like in- terests. Mr.
Brown,
went,"on to say that students join fraternities for so- cial prestige on the campus, inflation of the ego,"
and,for future contacts in the business world. Harold
W.,"Pfautz, Instructor in So- ciology, stressed mainly the question,"
"""Why",does the fraternity continue to
"exist?""",-Mr. Pfautzs' reasons are the solution fraternity houses provide for dining
and,
housing,"conditions, the material things fraternities offer, and the fact that students in college are"
young,people leading parasitical livei of
which,fiaternities are a natural p^irt.
He,claimed that students lose
much,of their individuality
when,they join a fraternity.
"""They",follow the drive to
conformity,"and mediocrity."" Mr. Pfautz. a fraternity"
member,"him. self, ended with a note of challenge: "".Aineriiaii fraternities"
"today,""","he said, ""lack a respectable rationale for existence."" Following lhe.se talks was a period of questions from the students. The discussion of"
this,interesting and timely subject was still in full swing
when,the clock said it
was,"time to adjourn. *Subscribe for the Bticknellian , ......,,, ' ""i *M**l,,,tl,,,l,,,,,,l|,,,, tt,i,tt t .*,illMII,, , >>l,,iH ,,...,...... l....i*.,.-.... Mil I, #.<<>>*>> ,,,,,,,,.** * : * "" ' : s"

And,with the smell of blood there was no stopping the Boys from Buck- nell as they scored two more fast ones right after the second half kickoff on a

From,"this point on, every man"

downed,"Colgate,. 12-"

whipped,"the Bisons, 13-0. So far this year Colgate has won two"
games,and dropped one while tha Bison.^ have a record of two and two. Colgate lost its first tussle of the sea- son to

(when,they get a chance to look) ap- prove of Bucknell's

I,then accosted an unidentified
student,of

comments,
on,girls'

dress,

time.,"Think they look slop- py.""--Betty Foust."
"""Compared","to students in jrirls' *chools,"
we,dress rather well. Tend to  be sloppy at times.
And--,"oh yes, the girls don't press their woolens.""-- ""Fritzie"". In view of these varied and reveal- ing remarks, all the reporter can say is. that the girls dress well according to the"
men,on the campus.

Voice,by Bobbie
Maurer,
One,of our most distinguished pro- fessors here at
Bucknell,
was,

He,

went,on to
Brown,
grade,"school,"
the,"teachers declared him to be a retarded child, and at the age of fourteen, he left the seventh grade."
He,"learned the printer's trade, and after five"
"years,",
returned,
to,"high school to finish it in two years, which care of decorations, and arrange Hal- lowe'en games. Individual wives are asked to bring a pound of candy, pea- nuts, cookies, pretzels, or apples. .\11 children"
are,
to,
be,"costumed, and prizes will"
probably,be
awarded.,"It is to be stressed that Bucknell Wives is an organization of the wives of all >students,"
undergraduate,
and,"grad- uate, vet and non-vet, and of the wives of faculty"
members.,
Wives,without children
may,
"""borrow""",any child and bring him along for a big time.
Bucknell,
Wives,will also hold a bake
sale,
at,"Dauberts, 31 << Market St.,"
beginning,at 9
Friday,morning.
Through,such sales the organization last year
was,able to
make,a cash contribution to the local Evangelical Hospital Project.
Perhaps,a similar charitable
endeavor,will
be,under- taken this year.

Much,credit should

may,be interested to know that Doctor
Robbins,once played football.
He,not only played
guard,
in,"high school and tackle in college, but coach- ed a high school"
team,for five years.
At,"that time it was one of his main interests, and he"
even,
managed,to referee
over,
one,

from,

became,a captain in the infantry in

He,
was,a

Guard,and
was,a
member,"of the re- serve corps. He was an instructor of English for a while at the University of Minnesota, and after attaining his Doctor's degree there in 1923. he came to Bucknell and has since retained his lofty position in the faculty."
Aside,
from,delving into transla- tions. Doctor Robbins'
main,interest lies in travel.
He,has toured parts
of,
"Canada,",
"Europe,","the Mediterran- ean, Egypt, Brazil, the Caribbean and"
Hawaii.,
Always,his
ambition,"has been to travel around the world. The publishing of four books is ac- i.dited to Doctor Robbins, and he has recently completed translatir)ns of the Iliad and"

"""Glamour","is more than having pret- ty legs and wearing a sweater well"", stated Miss"
Eva,"Le Gallienne in her informal intrcxluction speech at Lew- isburg High School on Saturday night. One of the greatest actresses of our time, Miss Le Gallienne reminded the audience that the real theatre is alive and every performance that we see is different, created especially for one particular audience. Supported by Kendall Clarke, Fred- erick Rolfe and"

As,a special encore two scenes from Ib.sen's
"""Ghosts""",were
given.,"Miss Le Gallienne, noted for her interpre- tation of Ibsen,"
informed,the audi- ence that she prepares her own trans- lations from the original Norwegian.
The,"final scene of ""Ghosts"" in which"
Oswald,

and,reverts to s state of childish imbecility seemed to
make,the
most,impact on the audi- ence.

The,tires on your car right now
may,have cords of
Cordura*,High
Tenac-,ity Rayon
yam.,"If so,"
you,benefit from one ofJ.he most important con- tributions that
Du,
Pont,scientists have
made,
through,the years to the
automotive,industry.
"""Cordura""",
High,
Tenacity,
Rayon,is
comparable,to structural steel in tensile strength. It
makes,"possible tires that are at once lighter, stronger and safer than pre-war tires. Unlike natural fibers, the qualities of this"
product,of
chemical,science are al- ways unifomn.
UNDIES,
TO,
TIRES,
At,"first,"
rayon,was used
mainly,in
making,articles of clothing.
"However,",with an
improved,tire cord in
"mind,",
Du,Pont scientists set out to
produce,a tougher rayon than any previously
known.,
The,
problem,was given to a skilled team whose
members,included
"organic,",
physical,
and,
analytical,
"chemists,","physicists,"
and,
chemical,
and,
mechanical,engineers.
One,of their first discoveries
wm,that strength could be increased
by,"using cotton linters as the source of cellulose, in place of"
wood,"pulp. It was found, also, that tlie viscose .solu- tion had to be"
prepared,and
handled,with extreme care.
Perhaps,the
most,
important,lesson was one
which,the
silkworm,
had,
taught,centuries be- fore: stretching increases strength.
The,
Du,Pont experimenters stretched the new yarn and
made,rayon with a ten- sile strength of about 70.000
pounds,to the square
inch--,
more,than twice the strength of textile
rayon,then being
produced.,
TRIED,
AND,
PROVED,

of,tire
maim-,"V kmttt of ""CoHwra"" aiMi rvbb<<r k--^"
VVM,"l*<<<<i*n, far *wMmI mtttm*. facturers,"
"""Cordura""",
was,tested in
heavy-duty,tires on baking-hot des- ert roads.
During,the
war,it
proved,itself on
command,"cars, trucks"
and,jeeps.
"Today,",
rayon,-cord tires are
widely,
used,
on,trucks
and,"buses,"
and,
leading,
manufacturers,use
Du,
Pont,
"""Cordura""",in tires
they,
make,for passenger cars.
The,
combination,of lightness
and,strength offered
by,
"""Cordura""",has also earned it a
welcome,from
makers,of
conveyor,"belts, V-belts and hose for domestic, agricultural and indus- trial uses. It is used to reinforce lam* inated kraft paper, to tie wires to electrical"
switt-hboardsand,as a chain
warp,in
carpets,to
bind,the
wool,tufts firmly
in,place.
One,of the newest uses is in plastic clothesUnes.

Company,
makes,

because,

an,idea

BUCKNELL,Last week
I,"chaileiigtHJ tin- validity of the status of Bucknell University PS<> a center of ""higher learning"" on the basis of the lack of personal integrity and respect for the rights of our fellow"
man.,"It  is still my firm belief, that the high decree of chi-ating in examinations is one of the most flagrant illus. trations of the inadequacies of Bucknell's ""Way of Life."" While cheating appears to be one of our 'tolerated ' folkways, many schools and colleges have successful honor systems, such as the University of \ irginia. Before any student enrolls there he has been thorouKhly familiar- i/ed with the mechanics and purpose of the honor syntem. He receiver liter, alure before arriving at the Cniversity, and during his first week at school h<< hears speeches by the most distinguished figures on campus. He meets in small groups where students have a chance to a.sk questions of student leaders and to sign the honor card saying they understand the sys. tem and are willing to abide by it. The questions are of such a nature that every person under.stand.s the system as it is: ""A Positive Force Working To Develop Men Of Integrity And To Bring Freedom From Mistrust To All Of University Life."" The strength of the honor system lies in the .<<itudent b<<idy's knowledge that it works and the pride that enables it to continue. When a teacher walks into a classroom to give an exam, he distributes the papers, answers questions con- cerninR their interpretation and then leaves the"
nM>m.,"The students may talk and they may go out to smoke. Nobody feels regimented; nobtKiy is under the strain of constant fear; nobody is suhje<ted to disturbing influences due to cheating and ""police teachers."" ""The word of a student at the University of Virginia is accepted <<i3 tAJth."" This word extends beyond merely academic honesty; it includes such disdainful practices as stealing and lying."
A,"student may leave his books on the steps in front of a building, his coat on a hall hanger and they v^il! be there when he returns. Occasionally some person is caught cheating or taking something illegally and he is brought before the Honor Committee, if found guilty, he is dis-"
j,"missed from the school. The procedure of dismissal enables the accu.sed to shr>vv valid reasons for his actions. He is considered iimocent until proven I otherwise. He may be brought up before the Committee by two of his fellow i students who un<iuestionably Ix-lieve he cheated, or he may appear voluntarily."
I,"The meetings are held in secret and the student may have any other student or person aid him in his defense. If the defcndent is acquitted the records an burne<i, and hand.-hakes are exihangwi by all concerned. The honor system has b<>come a respected tradition at the University of \ irginia. The maintenance of the system lie> in Ihe attitude and actions of every student on the campus who has a personal responsibility in maintaininx the "".status quo."" Now,"
I,"believe we can readily .see that there are at least five major con- Iributions that can bo developed by <<-reating an honor system at Bucknell University: First, I believe that an honor .>yslein will develop in each and every .student on the campus a sense of personal honor and integrity, and a sense of respect for the rights of other individuals. Second,"
I,"believe that -uch a system would promote friendlv relations In^tween students and faculty by giv- ing each u common ground of mutual honor and participation. Third, I believe (hat a honor system would do much to promulgate a strong feeling of communal spirit iimonu (he students on (he campus by enablinu all of Its to participate in a common proiect with a common spirit of brotherhood. Fourth, i believe that it would he of immeasurable aid to us u|Hin xraduation from this in>>titution. h\ giving to (he University invaluable prestige in every facet of social living. Finallv. it would enable, we. (he s(udents of ISucknell Cniversity lo show the administration and tacultv (hat (be s(udents of itucknell University are mature enouuh in their actions and lhough(s (o handle all student issues and problems without the guiding genius of an> outside source."

w<<ek,was the worst week of rushing I've ever .seen
at,Bucknell (I'm a senior t.
What,u.^ed to be mild dirty ru.shing became filthy. .Not  one fraternity had clean hands. Phi
Gamma,Delta was accu.sed by
Tau,
Kappa,Epsilon of dirty rushing.
The,Phi
Gams,pleaded
gulity.,The Inttrfraternity Council scolded them and that wa.s that. The thing is--nothing could be done about it.
The,
IFC,is a joke. They
make,rules
and,then don't have the Kuts to enf'<)rce them.
No,Precedent
They,".xaid that there was no prece- dent for punishing dirty rushers. The next time, they said, there would be a penalty."
What,a laugh! 1 think that all rushing rules should he dropped if we aren't going to live #'#P to
them.,There should be unlimit- ed rushing until a date fixed by the
IFC,to pledge men.
Kvery,"frojih should have a chance to vi.sit the houses they are interested in. With unlimited rushing, no house would be ai)Ie to keep up their rush- \^eL'k pressure for a month and a half. Lots Of Time"
When,the
day,
came,
for,giving pledge pins out. eveiyone would bavo bad more time to
make,up their mind.
H,this plan
waa,
adopted,
by,the
IFC.,there still would be the problem of
nmking,sure no pledge pins were out before the time
fixed.,
But,"*>> slron,^'"

How,would you like to go for a job
you,"desperately need being the best qualified candidate; yet, you're still"
turned,
down'.',
At,
Sunday,night's Student
Church,Dr.
Frank,
F.,Simp- son blasted
unfair,
employment,in simple but no uncertain terms.
Speaking,
"extemperoneously,",Dr.
Simpson,explained how the Fair Em- ployment Practices
Commission,is
working,in the six states
and,two citie.s
where,"it has already been es- tablished. ""Democracy,"" declared Dr. Simpson, ""can work if people are in- terested in seeing that it works."" Dr."
Simpson,"used the Conn. Draper ca.<<e,"
one,"of .500 complaints, as an"
example,of the several steps involved
when,
the,
commission,prosecutes a case.
When,a corjiplaint (which can be filed by
anyone),is
"made,",a field representative investigates and gath- ers all the facts. If the
employer,"is guilty, the agent presents the facts"
and,explains (if necessary)
why,un fair
employment,"is wrong. If the defendent refuses to comply, a ""cease and desist"" order can be is- sued whereupon the guilty party can be fined and"
jailed.,The defendent can still take the case into court but
the,court's verdict is
final.,(The
Draper,case was the only one to be taken to court).
The,"three points of the Fair Em- ployment program are education, ad- ministration, and"
persuasion.,""".*Ml"

The,

opeinng,
meeting,last
Thursday.,It
opened,with
a,
discussion,
of,John
T.,West's talk on registration as a professional
engineer.,
A,"tentative ;'.greement that such a talk should be planned as an annual event was reach- ed. Following this, the subject of a recent film, '"
"""Atomic","Physics"", w;is introduced. Because of the relatively large fee attached with the film, it was agreed that other societies than"
those,
connected,
with,engineering should be invited to jointly procure the film.
A,"few of the societies men- tioned were those connected with phy .<<ics,"
mathematics,"and chemistry. SiiKK^sts Bulletin Board Dr. Griffith, one of the faculty ad- vi.sors for the Council, suggested that the Council sponsor a bulletin board for the"
lobby,
of,
the,engineering
building.,This board
would,"be for the use of the various engineering societies, and would serve as a perm- anent poster for their activities. The next meeting of the Council is scheduled for"
November,9th at 4:30 in the afternoon in E103.

CREDIT,

GIVEN,
TO,
ENFORCEMENT,
OFFICERS,four main' headiiiK.s:
The,"fallacy of Things, tile fallacy of Place, the fal- lacy of Time and the fallacy of Tools."
Under,the heading
of,
"Things,",he
emphasized,the point that people tend to lay too
much,stres.s on the ma- terial things of life. Their lives be- come so cluttered with these non-es- ^ential8 that they are forced to g^ope blindly along a
narrow,gorge while calling it light.
"""Men",tend to feel that they could do wonderful things if they were only
somewhere,"else,"" he said. In discuss- ing his point of the fallacy of Place, Dr. Harris"
reminded,the
group,that the diamonds of the earth are in their
own,back
yards.,"Biblically stated, the eyes of the wise are before him, the eyes of the fool are on the hori- zon. Don't"
Waste,It!
For,"his third point,"
he,introduced the fallacy of
Time.,
He,brought to
mind,the picture of a college student
who,"buys all the latest study equip- ment and then spends his study hours deep in sleep. As a word to the wise, he quoted,"
"""What","you would one day be, you are"
now,"becoming."" Finally, he explained the fallacy of"
Tools:,
what,
we,
may,
think,"are weights, we can. through the proper application, turn to wing.s."
He,used the e.\ample of the relationship be- tween an oyster and a
pearl.,
An,oyster in
attempting,"to live with an irritating object turns it into a pearl, an irradescent beauty. In"

In,
The,
University*,
Last,
week,three divisions of the
.Moberly,
Study;,
"Humanities,",Com- merce and
Finance,
and,"Language,"
gathered,to
probe,further into Sir
Walter,Moberly's book.
"""The","Crisis in the University. The small, informal groups of stu- dents and faculty all met to acijuaint themselves further with this much- taikedrof book and to discuss its ap- plication to our own university."
The,"discussion of the Humanities Division, led"
by,Dr.
Harriman,and !
Jane,"Gale,"
was,primarily concerned with the changing conceptions of the university's
tasks.,
The,importance of
community,life in a college or university was obser%'ed. The students expres.sed their belief that a university should endeavor to bring about the establishment of a collegiate
community,to further the socio-educational aspects
of,a well knit
group.,This type of
group,"life also allows the invaluable interchange of ideas, which forward the achieve- ment of a liberal education."
No,Prejudice!
A,liberal education
can,free one
from,"bias, prejudice and enable one to"
make,"just discriminations through a sense of relative values. Basically, the"
group,"decided, the"
main,task of the university is to
keep,alive the most important values from one gen- eration to the next. Dr. Robert
Henderson,
and,"Chri^ Beagle led the discussion of the Com- merce and F^inance division, which"
began,
with,
an,
attempt,"to classify under one of three concepts of a university. It was decided that the third concept, that of the Tech- nological and"
Democratic,"University, was closest to Bucknell with its con- scious or"
unconscious,
stress,upon practical considerations. .**ince
modern,trends lean nutie . the acquisition of
money,"than knowl- edge, it is natural that a student in a university today will"
work,"primarily for grades to insuie future employ- ment, they said. ""What are the cau.ses of our pre.- ent discintent?"" was the topic of the"
Language,"division, led by Dr. Hooker. Professor Merritt and Lou Hind. .At"

Chapel,audienci yesterday
by,"the guest speaker. Dr. Lilburn Moseley, minister of the First Baptist"
Church,"of Pittsburgh, Pa. Dr."
Moseley,used as the basis of his talk the twenty-third Psalm. This
song,is the best
known,
and,most widely used for comfort and encour- agement. Its wide spread  appeal is due to the universal need for religious faith
and,
comfort.,It says to us that
God,"is our shepherd, a depend- able person that"
supplies,
the,"four needs of his -heep: food, safety, shel- ter and rest."
'I,shall not want' is an
important,phra.se
in,
these,times.
Wanting,can be material or an inner feeling.
The,Psalm telLs us that th'> shepherd will take care of both. *Several phrases of the song were e-\plained in terms of everyday living by Dr.
Hoseley.,'He- leadeth
me,be- -i'Je the still waters': one thing we ul! need is a short rest in a <|Uiet p!.T-e V. here things can regain their proper place in the

why,not vote it in

(Freshman),"October 26, 1950 To The Editor:"
The,English
Department,at Buck- nell University not only discourages creative
"thought,",
it,positively re- presses it.
Whether,the majority of the pro- fessors in that
department,"realize it. or not, the"
theme,
grading,staiidaids of most of
them,belong to that era in which the
Monk,painstakingly copied the Bible. Those standards are sadly out of place three centuries proceed- ing the literary
"""Age","of Enlighten- ment."" It is not"
uncommon,
for,
a,"paper, consisting of from one to five thou.- and vvoids, to receive a flat grade of"
F.,This grade is given becau.se of thiee or
four,technical
grammatic,errors; the subject
matter,
and,the ideas presented
therein,
receive,no consideration in the final determina- tion of that grade. No Charity .\sked
I,"do not appeal to .-sympathy, but to"
common,sense
when,
I,
ask,it
it,is either reasonable or fair that three or four
weeks,worth
of,
research,"and compo-^tion, as in the case of a term paper, .^liould receive this"
grade,by virtue of technlical >>>rrors only. Often the
term,paper is
a,"large factor in the determination of the final grade; the iniplicati<>>ns of this fact, in view of the present"
marking,"criteria, are self evident."
Several,
of,
the,"suppo.sedly ""best men"" of the"
department,are thorough- ly satisfied with papers which merely restate trite and
hackneyed,"ideas in words of one syllable, .so long as the technical"
grammatic,aspects
of,the paper
conform,"to th>>' standards of an inane and elsewhere obsolete ""blaek- Ist"". OrKinality Don't Count"
To,"the author.- of ihe.-^e verveless and unoriginal papers, go the grades of"
A.,
Other,students
who,"have en- deavored to put thought and original- ity int<< their work, receive grades of"
D,
and,
F,because of errors obviously typographical or some misplaced com- mas or semi -colon.-.
The,student
presently,
begins,to leali/e
that,
thought,
matters,"but little, and that the only concern of mo.st of these literarily dogmatic crit- ics rests"
upon,
form.,
By,the time this student has
been,"battling this situation for three years, he too will"
become,concerned
only,"\*'ith form. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the"
"department,","in general, does not foster the"
development,"r>>f creative thought. Granted that the.<<<e technical a.spect,s are important, papers then, should re- ceive two gra<les; one for content and one for punctuation, etc. The e.xist- ing system of theme evaluation is an outrage in the modern era and it most a.ssuredly serves to inhibit academic progressiveness. *Not ar; Engineer. prove cor To 'I he Editor:"

C.,at
Bucknell,
has,
received,
a,stinging
wound,"from the pen of ""a disgusted fraternity"

"--""The",

were,
adopted,"""a strong"

Do,you think these

enjoy,
hearing,their

mocked?,
Do,
you,not believe that they are doing their best to im- nditions? Honest Effort The
members,of the present

I.,
F.,
C.,It has been very difficult to break
down,this con- ception. The individual fraternities
must,be willing to sacrifice
some,of their interests for the benefit of the entire group of fraternities.
I,"won- der if the ""disgusted fraternity"
"man""",
and,the fraternity in
which,he is a
member,
has,
supported,as
much,as possible the various projects of the council. If he has
done,ail
he,can for his
I.,
F.,
C..,he
may,then criticize. Too Late If an accusation of dirty rushing
had,occurrwj early in the
week,"of rushing,"
I,feel certain that the guilty party
would,
have,
been,"penalized. However, as it were, the council felt that since it was late in the week and since it was the first incident reported during a week in which"
many,"had oc- curred, a"
serious,
reprimand,would suffice in that case.
Why,were there not other cases
reported?,
Was,"this the fault of the rules, or the fault of the"
I.,
F.,
C?,Ir
was,it the fault of th<^ individual
fraternities?,
The,I.
F.,
C.,can only succeed if the
member,fraternities supp<>>rt it to the limit. The rules set
up,by the
I.,
F.,
C.,at least give some form of (irder to rush

Would,unlimited rushing do
this?,
I,
think,
unlimited,rushing
Would,result in
more,confusion and less satisfaction.
The,
I.,
F.,

I,must contact him in this
way,for he did not desire to sign his

Have,you noticed that the Bucknell
women,
seem,to lack their usual pep
and,
vitality?,
Do,
they,
go,around
campus,with a
tired,
and,haggard
look?,If your answer is yes to these questions then here is an explanation. Rushing is under way.
On,
Sunday,
afternoon,the Panhel- lenic Tea
marked,the
beginning,of formal
rushing.,
Anxious,
Freshmen,
met,the equally anxious representa- tion from
each,"soi-ority,"
and,the battle of associating
names,and faces was on. In the evening the
Open,Houses be- gan. Groups of
Freshmen,"girls were ushered around to the different suites, where girls in black dresses"
welcomed,them eagerly and sang their sorority
songs.,
Refreshments,were served to the
Freshmen,"who, by the third <fpen house, were forcing"
the,
food,
down,"their throats, while the starving sor- ority members"
looked,
on,hungrily. Then the
Freshmen,went back to their
"Dorms,",
trying,
to,
keep,"everythinjr straight,"
and,
the,upperclasswome.i turned to the task
of,
cleaning,up their disheveled suites
for,another night. As the
week,progresses the cin-les
grow,"deeper, work piles up, and sleep"
becomes,a thing of the
past.,I>>ng- suffeiing professors are
by,
now,ae-
eustomed,to speaking before a group of sleeping students
and,usually re- frain from giving tests
during,"this period. (But there are exceptions). Thus, as another season's rushing is"
drawing,to a
close,
we,find our
weary,eo-eds
wondering,
how,they II ever catch up on their
work,(not to
mention,
sleep).,
"However,",although sighs of relief can be heard from both
Freshmen,and upperclass
dorms,after
rushing,"is over, mo.st evej-yone will admit that it's a lot of fun and that they"
know,a lot
more,people on the Bucknell
campus,
than,
they,would have otherwise.

month,before the torture
bogan.,This hazing followed sorority lushincr. It would have ha<l in. he position of the educaional adniin- istiation was
changing.,"To illustrate his point, Doctor Davies took one spe- cific class of educational administra- tors--the superintendents. Early Concept The first concept of superintendents of schools was that they were teach- ers who were above others in quality and as a reward they were given the job of superintendent or chief teacher. The second concept originated in the period"
when,the large corporation be- gan to
flourish.,This c<mcept was that
the,
superintendent,
was,
a,"big boss or president of an organization. In this concept, the teachers were"
thought,of as being several classes below the
superintendent,
and,"were only to be given orders. The next concept, which was devel- oped within the past 25 years, was based on a demtx-ratic idea. In this concept, the whole school system had a share in policy. .Modern Concept"
Expounded,Lately another concept of this job has
developed.,"In this concept, not only does the school have a share in policy,"
but,al.so
the,
community.,
Therefore,"today, the superintenden:"
must,"not only run the schools, but also be active in the"
community.,This puts a heavy burden on the superin- tendent and i<<
evidenced,
by,what might be termed occupational hazards such as ulcers. The variations in the nature of the job
has,resulted in a study of this problem. In order to discover whether or not there is a better
way,"to pre- pare for a job in the field of education- al administration, .-tudies have been undertake*: by van-'Us giuups. KelluKg Foundation Study"

Over,"$455,000 of the Kellogg appropriation has been allotted to Teachers College, Colum- bia for the next five"

reforms,
which,are needed in educational administration.

SOCCER,.Sigma Chr won the soccer cup Mo.t-

Si^ma,in the deciding
game,of the best of three playoff
series.,
The,
scoie,"was 2-0. Previously,"
SX,won the first
game,4-1 and
KS,
won,the .second
game,2-0 to set the stage for
what,proved to be a hard fought finale. In the first quarter
of,
the,final
game,both teams started driving hard with .Miller then
C.,
Schaumberg,.scor- ing for
.SX.,The next three quarters were .scoreless.
K.S,
KS,
seemed,al- most always to be in
SX,territory but
was,unable to capitalize on
any,of numerous scoring opportunities. Perhaps the outstanding feature of the
game,was the defensive play of
SX.,
The,goalie
and,"fullbacks were always on the alert and, though often pressed, broek the back of every"
K3,drive.
The,entire  series
was,well played with the steadiness of
SX,winninj; over the rather off and on quality of play displayed by
K.S.,

also,
played,winninf singles
and,doubles for the losers. He displayed brilliant tennis through- out the match. Sinclair settled the issue by beating
Lyons,in a see-saw 9-.s battle which was in doubt until the final point. Scoi^es of the match were:

During,
our,"talk,"
I,
le^iwid,that Alice
was,born in
Germany,about 19 years
ago.,"She attended a public school for 11 years (four years of grade school, and seven years of hign school), which placed her on an equal level with our high school graduates. The"
German,"schools, she told me, are quite different from ours."
A,student there often carries as
many,as 15 subjects at one time! Government Directs Education
During,"recent years, education was directed largely by the government. I'or example, history consisted most- y of Hitler's life and the story of his"
dictatorship,Four languages are re- <iuired of the
German,
high,"school graduates, but in order to learn to -peak"
and,write
a,
foreign,"tongue fluently, it  is neces.sary to live in that country, Alice explained. She should"
know,from experience; when she first arrived in the
U.,
S.,"she spoke almost no Engli.sh, but she accomplished the seemingly impo.^sible feat of learning to speak"
and,write it fairly well in I he short space
between,
September,
md,Christmas! In
"Germany,","Alice was a leader of several youth groups, and in this ca- pacity attended, three sunmiers ago. a Christian Youth"
camp,in that coun- try.    It
was,there that she met the
American,students who later persuad- I ed her to attend college in the
U.,
"S.,","and the American minister, who,"
I,through vaiious funds and organiza- j'tions.
arranged,for hei- to come. Finally Transfers Here # In
September,of 1949. Alice entered
Hardwich,College in
New,York. Thij year she transferred to Buckne
j,"Alice's family, her father, mother. two sisters, and two brothers, are still in"
"Germany,","so she has no rela. t tives here. She worked at a German farm in . -New Hope. Pennsylvania la.st sum- mer.    ""It was good to  be eating Ger- man food again"", she said."
At,"first our rich, well-balanced meals made ; her .sick, for she was"
accustomed,to **ager war ration.s.
Now,she'll set- tie for half and half
--,
American,"food in the winter, and German food in"
I,"the summer. And she mu>>.t like Bucknell's food, because she works as a waitress in"
the,
women's,dining hall. Musically Inclined
For,"an extra curricuiar activity, Alice sings in Chapel choir. She has taken V(x:al lessons, and wants to join the"
Women's,"Glee Club next .semester. Her taste in music runs from Classi- cal, which she knows best, to Ameri- can Jazz. As for the future, missionary duty in the far ea.st is Alice's"
goal.,At Bucknell she is taking primarily the courses in religion
and,"sociologj-. ""I want to"
work,"with people"", she told me,"
"""Japan",has interested
me,for a long time; there is so
much,"to be done there."" .\lice has adopted a more optimis- tic view of life since she has been in"
America.,
How,can her people have a similar outlook when they have seen nothing but
war,all their life? It's not war as we see it
--,from a distance; but war that comes to your
own,"door- sep, brtinging death and destruction. Alice has"
made,"the nio.-t of her op- portunity to better herself, so that she"

Homewhat,"insistently this lime, when the Bisons square off aKain.st Temple .Saturday in Philadelphia for their sixth shot at the Old Shoe Trophy. Thin^.s are a little different this* year, for the"
Herd,will take the field with
everybody,
from,Al
Humphreys,
down,to the locker room cat thinking
Harry,Lawrence's Big
Team,is going to pluck the Owls right
down,to their pin feathers.
Where,does a team that's lost three
games,in seven starts get ideas like that?
Maybe,"from the words <>f Colgate' Coach Hixler who rated Bucknell's line better than any team's he had faced this year, with the exception of"
Army,who he thought was deeper.
Maybe,
from,the fact that they've stopped the fair haired boys of seven
teams,this year ;ind turned
them,all back with less than oO yards gained from scrimmage.
Maybe,from the fact that they are walloping
teams,this year that they only
squeaked,through by one or two
touchdowns,last year.
Maybe,
they,think it's about time the Old
Shoe,
graced,
the,Bucknell show ca.se for awhile.
And,
maybe,ju.st because they've got
enough,spirit
and,
confidence,after dishing out two shellackings in a row to take up
where,
they,left
off,in Philadelphia last year -- inches short of victory on the small end of a 20-19 score. But the
Lawrencemen,won't be de- luded with the idea that a
rampaging,
Herd,will
catch,
an,

year.,A! Kawal's charges have rolled up four impressive victories and
a,
7-7,"tie with Penn State, losing only to power-"
laden,
Rutgers,"in the final .seconds,"
26-20.,
And,"with the possible excep- tion of Gene Caterina, the Cherry and"
White,will be at full
strength,"fo,- their upstate rivals. In a series that started in 1927, the"
Herd,has
won,
only,
4,
games,"to Temple's 12, and the teams have bat- tled to 7"
stalemates.,Last year's 20- 19 thriller was the clo.sest of  course.
The,traditional rivals have played 5 times for the Old Shoe
Trophy,since its inception in 1945
and,"the Wise Ones have inscribed their names on it five straight times. Students, .scribes, and Ph^iladelphia fans are all pretty well agreed that this is the"

Jewish,
and,
Christian,"faiths, as"
preathed,by Jesus
and,"Paul. i> the great physician of the soul, heart and mind of the"
human,"body. .^lenlal health, as defined by Doctor I. ook. is a"
synonym,
of,happiness. Individuals
may,have the
wrong,idea of happiness and how to get it. They <<pend their lives
looking,
for,th?
wrong,thing and
w<mdering,"if happi- ness exists. These people tend to be tense and grouchy and in this condi- tion lose their mental health or hap- piness and with it their bodily health. Happines.*. he -aid, consists of peace of mind, adjustment to conditions and a sense of security. The most"
common,sickness today is mental. Great masses of people now ate
unhappy,"and lonely. Religion is tl'.e great physician for ail th;.*. Bible's .Account In the Bible, the word 'blessed"" is used to denote"
happiness.,
The,Be- atitudes in the
?ermon,on the
Moun,tell in detail what happines- lomes \f the followers of the
Way.,"Paul, in almost all of his letters, .started with reasons"
why,
Christians,
should,be
happy,"or blessed. Doctor Look believes there ari three major fallacies of religiour thinking today. First, some peopk believe that religion is concerned only with the afterworld and provides"
method,of escape
from,"the problem- of daily living. Second, some believ that religion is something apart from life and can be cut off from it at wil Lastly, some people think of religioi as only the buihdinga in which the ac- tivities are housed or as the difTeren divisions or"
denominations,within thi universal church. Fear Is
A,Problem
The,
speaker,
next,
answered,the ([uestion
'What,
happens,
when,a per- son transcends
to,
the,"religious?"" There is no fear in love."
Many,"men- tal diseases are caused by fear, mos^ of it irrational such as fear of guill criticism or life itself."
A,cure foi
mental,disease is the facing of lif squarely and unafraid. To those
who,would be religious he suggested that they develop a sens.- of gratitude. He lilso suggested that one
would,find the true love in ser- vice. Religion
has,
no,"substitute. ""Re ligion is the"
food,
of,

This,
weekend,a
segment,of the
people,of
Burma,will
have,their
thoughts,on
Bucknell.,
The,
annual,
Burma,
Conference,will
dominate,"not only the local, but, in part, the"
international,scene. I'lans
have,
been,
completed,to
make,the
weekend,
>tudy,a I)r()titable
one,for those
concerned.,
You,can rea<i the details on the front
page.,Hut there is
more,to the
Hurma,
Conference,than
merely,
following,a
program.,
Everyone,will
have,a share in the
"conference,",
whether,
they,realize it or
not.,
For,the
impression,
we,give of
Bucknell,this
weekend,will be a lasting one in the
minds,of our guests.
.Although,we aren't a school
steeped,"in tradition,"
we,do
have,iTiat
"""Hello""",
sjiirit.,
We,don't
have,to
put,"on a false front for *our guests, but"
we,do have tf)
make,sure that
each,one of us con- tribute-i his
"""Hello""",t<i the guests.
"Naturally,",a Hello goes
deeper,than just a
word.,It's an at- titude of friendliness that
"""Hello""",
stands,
for.,
Our,
campus,is vmall
enough,to include the
study,of friendship
and,big
enough,to
show,that the
study,hasn't
been,in vain. < )ur
Burma,frienil-
come,from difterent
backgrounds,than
do,
most,of

Their,visit affords an
opportuniity,t(>> see
how,
they,
ihink,
about,
international,"issues,"
hear,their
views,
on,
"America,",
and,"realize that regardless of color, race, religion, etc.,"
man,is the
same,the

Home,n.ajor companies conducted
summer,"interviews on the campus for the first time in hi.'^toiy. Six months ago ""placement personnel in colleges were vitally concerned about the problem of placing 1951 graduates,"" Minkler .said."
"""Now","it appears beyond any doubt that no such problem will exist, if, in fact, it ever did."" He explained that engineering graduates of the pa.st year, despite pessi- mistic pre-graduation predictions, had been placed as quickly as those of any previous class and that starting salaries had slightly exceeded those of pre- vious years. ""Even without partial mobilization for war, there is every reason to be- lieve that the technological"
demands,of our society will require an ever-in- ci easing
number,of engineers in relation to the total
working,"force of the nation."" This, he .-^aid, coupled with decreased enrollment of freshmen in the engi- neering colleges in the last two years, creates a real possibility of a"
shorta^,"of engineering graduates by 1952 or earlier. << * * * * The Lin4>>n Bark credits the Daily Texan with reporting that the follow- ing question was a.-ked in a chemistry quiz at that school: ""The"
aroma,"which emanates from Chemistry 605 is caused by """
Came,"the reckoning and ""teachers jokes"" led ""hydrogen sulfide"" by a vote o' 2 to 1."

Norwich,University will be re- quired to .-tudy American history. Major General Ernest
N.,
"Harmon,","president of the military college,"
announced,here
recently.,Liberal Arts students on this
campus,always have taken
American,"history, and now those in eni^nneer- ing courses also will be taught this -fubject."
A,semester of
American,"history- will be required of all freshmen. ""I have been both surprised and disappointed to find"
many,"students enter- ing college without a satisfactory background in the hi.story of their own coun- I try,"" President"
Harmon,
commented.,"""In times like these,"
when,
young,
men,are being called into the
armed,services --
many,of them possibly to make the supreme sacrifice
--,"it  is essential that they should have real understanding of the history of their own country, of its traditions, and of the principle.s which made it justly"
great.,
Knowledge,"of one's own country and of the background of institutions certamly is a must in these days when both conditions and thinking too often are chaotic."""
*****,The Syracuse Daily Orange reports that a bra burglar looted a girl.s
dorm,"early one morning, causing a hasty fire drill and frightening some 90 girls. Two girls discovered a man in their room at 2 a, m. and sounded the alarm after first scaring the prowler off."
When,"things calmed down, it wa-s dis-"
I,covered that the prowler had left the following note for his victims:
"""You",look I very
charming,in your sleep.
Thank,"you for your bra.ser. Ha-ha-ha."" The big surpri.se came later that same night when a dozen ed gladiolas, a note of apology and the loot were received by the girls in the"
dorm.,The ex- planation: the prowler claimed he was trying to prove to his pals that he was a
commando,during the war.
*,">> * * * State College. Pa. -- (I. P.) -- The Pennsylvania State College recently di- rected the removal of bars from fraternity houses and other student quarters and expressly forbid the possession or use of alcoholic beverages on college property in a sweeping regulation announced by the administration. In a letter addres.sed to ""all student organizations,"" the College said that rules have been openly disregarded. ""Actually,"" the letter points out, ""more bars have been installed, nmre drinking parties have been held, and the reg- ulations in regard to mixed drinking have been openly disregarded."" *1C:C0 p.m."

paper.,It serves a unique purpo.^e in bringing to the publication the type of interest with important questions of the day thai is .^o vitally
interwoven,
with,"an ""alert"" Bucknell campus."
A,column which deals with vital issues is bi)und to present if not ad- vocate causes which are not supported by every reader. This merely prove- that the question is not settled. Un-bias Aim Any editor who is intellectually honest will
welcome,publication in his paper of aiticle.'i which will provoke
I,"discussion and comment, even if they are not in jjeneral accord with his own views. j One thing i.s certain. No over- '"
whelming,majority of the
campus,fol- ^ lows the column every week. Yet this type of popularity is usually limited lo ihe cartoon.* only. Suiely the small part of the paper
[,that is devoted
to,this
column,is j Worth-while if it afford.- the average

The Editor: Inside the entrance of the Bi.son, noticeable as one leaves, is a picture of a .^cene from ""Ah, Wilderness"" It was taken in Hunt Hall recreation room, where rehear.'ials are being held, and the furniture has been ar- lanc^ed to simulate a bai scene.

knew,whal he wa>> talking about Hhtii he predicted that the Bisons would'clean up
NYU,by a five touch- down marKin. That's exactly what they did!
The,Violets i.f
.NYU,threw i!i
every-deg-,"- thing they could, except"
maybe,"the benches, but were unable to"
come,up with more than seven points as they
faced,
the,
Bisons,
on,
a,
somewhat,
swampy,
Memorial,

The,score
seemed,
to,
indicate,the
swampy,"conditions also, for"
when,the final buzzer
had,"sounded, the"
Herd,neatly tucked
away,"its fourth win, 41-7. Three of the Bison backs, Burt Tal- niage, Bob Albert and Nick Yackanicz took scoring honors,"
gathering,two touchdowns apiece while Jack Maeby's educated toe sent five points through the uprights. The Herd's offensive line was open- ing four-lane
highways,all afternoon
whenever,(|uarterback

Dean,re-

The,Bisons controlled the play most of the
PM,and seldom fail- ed to roll up yardage
when,they had ( possession of the pigskin.
NYU,es- caped a shut-out in the fourth period
when,scut-hack Bill F'ayne took Stie fel's kick-off on his eight and raced] the final .score at 41-7 ninetv-two vards for the Violets lone ' Score by periods: drive was temporarily halted by the scoreboard clock.
The,Bison drive continued to the \iolet 9-yard line before the city boy were able to check the attack.
New,York was soon forced to kick to their
own,foity-two
where,big Nick Yack- anicz went off tackle to the 3-yard
line.,
Two,plays later
he,stepped across to score.
Maeby,again found his mark. It wa.s
on,the following kick-off that Billy
Payne,proved his worth as a
trackman,with ninety-two yards of broken-field running to score the only Violet
touchdown.,Girolamo convert- ed.

Maeby's,"kick was faulty so the Bisons settled back to see what he Violet had to offer. Push- ed to their fifteen, the"
New,Y'orkers were forced to kick.
Maeby,returned the punt to the
New,York .3.5-yard line
where,Albert took the hand-off from
Dean,to scoot

Maeby,found his

Maeby's,tot- was true and it looke<i like the Herd was well on its
way,"to a shut-out. Figure This Out The third period saw .New York put on a drive starting on the Bi.son ten. Three plays backfired, thanks to some fine defensive rushing, and the"

one,defeat by trouncing
Western,

North,Field last Friday' afternoon.
The,
triumph,
was,the Herd's second .*igain>t three .setbacks. Right inside Dick

scored,
the,other markers for the Held.
The,first half
was,
played,undei leaden skies on a field that was wet :ind
slow-moving.,
The,rain began pelting
down,in the third period and by the end of the
game,the players were covered with
mud.,
These,cmi- ditions
made,the goalies' tasks un- enviable. In the first perit>d the Herd applied the pressure from the start by keep- ing the ball
deep,in
Western,Mary- land territory.
"However,",the Bisons were unable to score until
IS,"minute, had gone by. Koush Kallies"
Then,a
pushing,
infringement,was called against the
Marylander>,in the penalty
area.,
Dick,

he,net
and,"Bucknell led. 1-0. .After missing .several opportunities to score following three corner kicks, the Bisons ^nted the twines again at the"
nine-minute,
mark.,
Andy,Shirk booted a

Before,

up,Bucknell's third goal on a hard grolind shot into the right cor- ner of the corda at the six-minute mark. Kight

Pro-Files,
Dr.,
James,
A.,
Gathings,by Bobbie Maurer Dr.
James,
A.,
Gathings--,that's the friendly professor with the southern accent.
He,is perhaps best
known,arounJ
campus,for his
amazing,ability t' stimulate a real interest in govtrn- nient. even at eight o'clock
in,the
morning,
when,
he,
teaches,political science over in Bucknell
Hall.,It
might,"be that his soothing southern drawl does the trick, though his own obvious"
enthusiasm,
for,
the,cour.se probably plays a major part.
When,we assume that Dr. Gathings hails from
the,
"Southland,",
we,"are right, since"
North,
Carolina,
is,"his home state. .^11 the scraps and fight.'?, joys"
and,"excitements experienced in any normal childhood, were a part of his growing"
up.,"It seems he favored North Carolina, since he attended col- lege there, acquiring his"
AB,degree at
Furman,"University, and going on to get his master's at"
Duke.,The
"""yankees""",must has'e held
some,"fas- cination for him. though, for he gain- ed his doctor's degree at"
New,
York,University after attending the Uni- versity of Chicago for a year. .An Alhlete. He Sports were
among,Dr. Gathing's top interests while in college.
Know-,"ing that he participated in class bas- ketball and boxing, especially the lat- ter, some of you"
may,be a bit more reluctant to cut his class from now on. Softball and tennis were also
among,his athletic interests.
He,enjoys reading
and,"traveling,"
though,he agrees with
many,other professors in saying he does not have too
much,spare time
to,
do,either. (I'm sure we'd all be more than will- ing to grant our professors some ex- tra time
--,say one
or,
two,
cuts,a
week!),Dr.
Gathings,"has already traveled quite a bit. though, since he has visited all but five or six of the 48 statHS, as well as parts of Canada."
And,not
being,
one,
of,California's
many,"boosters, he"
much,prefers tho Pacific Northwest to that state. Dr. Gathings' interests
have,nul been confined alone to teaching. Ho
Hr.,
Gathings,
had,experience as a
"salesman,",ami then as a
foreman,"with International Harvester in Akron. Ohio, before at- tending college. While in South Caro- lina, he was superintendent of a con- solidated (white) school,"
and,"two negro schools,"
where,he had
some,of his
most,interesting
experiences,in education. It
was,in 1932 that Dr. Gathings first
came,to our
"campus,",
and,"after a leave of absence, in 1936 he return- ed, and ha.<< been with us ever since."
"""Who's",
Who,"in the East"" has listed him. and he has written two books and several articles and just in case you haven't already guessed, our amiable political science profes.-^or likes the school very much."
Campus,
Quizzer,Elaine
Vouyoukas,"For this week, the topic under dis- cussion was:"
Do,you think students should be allowed to take as
many,cuts as they want'.' This could be and
was,a decided battle bet-ween a well
known,disputer of law and order at Bucknell
and,a
member,of the
faculty.,
But,all's well that ends well (or did
it?),Or shall we just say the impartial judges for this week's decision could not de- cide and called it a tie?
I,first had to choose a
member,of the faculty
who,would give a pretty accurate
answer,for all the faculty.
A,"brilliant thought, (rare but it does"
"happen),",hit
my,
head.,
Miss,Necci!
Her,
answer,
was,"typical, to say the least."
"""NO!""","""If it were left up to the ^tudents discretion,"
I'm,
afraid,we wouldn't have any
students,left in class. Probably have to post advance notices of class
"meetings.""",True. True. It was then suggested
I,get a typi- cal student's reaction to this question.
I,"picked Dick Lang,"
more,
commonly,
known,
around,
campus,"as ""College"
"Joe.""","His opinion was, ""Absolutely, if they can"
get,
the,stuff -- no use
comin',
every,
"day.""",If
you,would care to
inquire,
further,
on,"Dick's theories on this subject, you"
may,find
him,"at 10 o'clock every Mon., Wed., and Fii. at the"
Bison.,"Supposedly he has Latin class at that atrocious hour, but being an outstanding student, he can afford to cut."
I,then
turned,
to,
the,authority
against,all authority
--,
Guy,"Payne. This wise man. class of '09, has de- fended his grounds innumerable times against such overbearing .statements of this sort. His answer was a gem"
of,philosophic
wisdom,and
I,quote:
"""The",only place in the world a man can play is in college. The more cuts he can get. the better
he,"likes it."" ""Well done thou"
good,
and,"faithful servant."" This comment made by aHU>>>>IUI>MM>>IIMI< I till""! limllMlMlllllH"" ** "" , * *#""""""<"

Gordon,Masters spoke on voltage reg- ulation. Increasing of the branch's
membership,by the activation of more lower class
EEs,was al.so discussed at the meeting.
One,of the highlights of the past
week,
was,the
temporary,appointment of Professor
Warren,
DeW.,
Garman,as
head,of the
Mechanical,Engineering
Department.,All engineering students meet Professor
Garman,in their Soph- omore year
when,they take .Mechanics
(MK,20<)). I{ecau.se of the material which is covered and the angle from
which,"it is pre.sented,"
many,students have
come,to regard Profe.ssor Gar- man as a man of
theory.,"Thi.s, how- ever, is not the case."
Although,he
has,
been,"teaching for 27 years, his work, previous f. the educational"
REISH,
BROS.,

Arizona,
mining,camps where he learned the machinist's trade before he entered college.
He,"major- ed in Mechanical Engineering at Penn State,"

work,with Genera! Electric.
Here,he was
employed,on their test floor and as

Dodge,Broth- ers where he first
was,head of the physical testing .laboratory
and,then went to the plant engineering depart Mient
where,he
worked,
on,several pha.ses of productiorf
such,
as,core ovens and conveyor systems. During the first World War. he was attached to the Chalkis Manufactur- ing Co. as a liaison officer in the pro- duction of 3-inch antiaircraft guns. His work called for the application of engineering ideas
to,
the,"practical necessities of the machinist's trade. .After the war, Professor"
Garman,was with General
Motors,an<l then went hack to General Electric.
Comes,
To,
BU,"In 192;5, Profes.sor"
Garman,started his College teaching career at
Auburn,"Polytechnic Institute,"
"Auburn,",Ala- bama. After two year's at
API.,he transferred to
Bucknell.,Since his coming to
"BU,",he has taken two year.-* out for
graduate,
work,and one year for defence
work.,His graduate work consisted in studying in the Physics
Department,for one year at Yale and '*ne year at the liiiversity of Virginia.
During,

War,
"II,",he
was,in charge of process experimenting and building
departments,"at the Manhat- tan Project. Previous to this, he was coordinator for the pre-flight training"
program,which was conducted here at Bucknell under the
CAA's,war train- ing program. ( In addition to earning his
Ground,"Instructor's Certificate in navigation,"
meteorology,"and engines, he al.so accumulated 8ixt>>>>en hours of solo flying time.)"

From,"""The Lord Is"

was,an
immense,success.
The,S5-voiced choir
under,the able direction of
William,

mem-,"bers, the Chapel Choir has"
grown,to the pre.sent
membership,"of 5(>, includ- ing both men and"
women.,
The,
Mother's,

the,rest

Mr.,
McRae,"stated that with the gift of the gowns, the choir was started on its"

The,
Village,A-stsociation's first
meeting,under its newly elected offi- cers was held
Sunday,evening at the
apartment,of President
Jack,Peters.
Under,"Jack's able leadership,"
many,items of interest about life in the*
V.,were discussed;
committees,"were ap- pointed to handle such duties as main- tenance, safety, publicity,"
and,social
and,financial activities.
With,"28 families repiesented, simple arithme- tic tells us that 22 families stayed at"
home.,
Next,
month,"the meeting will be held on the Hill, and every house- hold should"
make,a serious effort to have at least one
member,present.

The,

Doan,"to Gallagher aerials, once earh on runs by"
Taimage,"and .Meyers, and once on a .iparkling pans interception"
by,the
hard-running,
Van,John.-^on. BuKtling Burt Twlniage also had one
TD,called back. IK'fenwive Kxcellence But honors for the day went to  the begrimed defensive scjuad that messed up the Wise Ones' best effort.s all af- ternoon and held them on downs when the
Kawal,charges clawed their way to the Bison 4-.vard line a
few,min- utes aft<<r the intermission. Thi.n was the only serious threat of the
game.,It
was,the straw titat broke the Owl's back as far as most ob>>er\'ers \MMe concerned. The first tally came on the end of a
74-yard,
march,in
the,first quarter with
Bob,Albert
throwing,a 26-yard pass to the
phenomenal,Joe Gallagher who caught it with a
Temple,
man,"sit- ting on either shoulder. Jack Maeby, who had a perfect day at the uprights, converted. Alex Duplicki. built like a fireplug and just as hard to move, set up the second score"
when,in the 2nd (juarter
when,he
pounced,
on,Paul Maguire's
fumble,on the
Temple,42.
Taimage,and
Meyers,went to the
27,
in,two
tries.,The
Owls,"checked briefly at this point,"
but,
Tommy,"Dean,"
who,
Mcms,to like the field in

room,
during,"the half, but 'it"
was,a ditfertnt
team,that
came,
onto,the field for the 3rd quarter. Their first opportunity to retaliate came
when,George Sarkos intercepted a Bi.son pa.s8 on the Herd's 47. Gene Caterina then promptly moved it
down,"to the 12 in one play, a substantial gain. The liest they could do then was get it to the 4 in three more tries, and"
when,the center of the defensive wall
hunched,"its back and held them for downs, the Templars discovered their best was not ((uite good enough. And a few minutes after that the beleagured"
Owls,
were,"lining up to block a try for point, for the fleet- << footed Brad"
Meyers,had
removed,the hog^kin from where it sat on the 30- yard line
and,sprinted 70 yards with it
around,right end for the third counter of the game. Maeby
made,It 3 for 3.
"Taimage,",still
smarting,
from,"the loss of his nullified <!!> yarder of the Ist canto, showed everybody it wasn't a mistake"

London,

A,"wealthy British subjec-t died and left his fortune to the hospital on certain .oiidit ions-- those being that the man's fully dressed skeleton,"
topped,

The,great
number,
of,

through,has sht)wi. that
men,have learned to die together even though they have not learned to live

Founded,In 18M9
Organized,originally as the
Dem-,"osthenean Club, with a particular in- terest in public speaking. Delta"
Sigma,
became,a s<HMal fraternity
some,ten years after its founding in 1H89. In 1905 the fraternity rented head quarters in
Lewisburg,as a place of
meeting.,Just before W<>>rld
War,"1. the Demies, as they are called on cam- pus, purchased a house on St. Georgr> Street, a-ross the street"
from,Larison Hall.
The,house had been the
home,.if
the,fraternity's
sponsor.,Dr.
Thomas,Franklin
Hamblin.,profe-sor of Greek. Just before the outbreak of World
War,"I!, the"
new,
chapter,"hou.<<e on College"" Hill was erected. Utilized by the college during the"
war,"years, it was furnished and occupied by Delta"
Sigma,in 1946
when,men students le- turned from service.

Two,students were confined to the

Although,"x-rays are being taken, the complete injuries are not"
known,as yet. ( Hospital authorities stated that neither
man,"had been drinking). The students were di.scovercd in th-i car. a 1950 .Mercury coupe belonging to Troast, about 2:15 this"
morning,on the hill outside

G.,"h.eith FuiHton in hiH annual report, pablished recently. President Funslon reiter- ated his belief that 'the natL.n mu.rt introduce a program of univer.^al military liaining before it will be adequately prepared."" He also reported that the academic work of students on this"
campus,rose to the hiKhest level on record in 1949->>0 and that academic mortafity was re- duced. The all-colfe'Ke average increased
from,"75.9 to 77.41, exceeding the previous all-time high of 7fi.6 achieved in 1940-47 at the peak of veteran en- .ailment. Only 10"
men,were iec|uired to
withdraw,from college
m,lyoO aa
compared,"with 24 in 1949 and 42 in 1948, he added. Kspecially notable, President Funston said, was the fact that for thv first time on record the average of all fraternity men was better than that of non- f-aternitv"
men.,Gratifying al.so was the
improvement,in the
freshman,aver- age from 73.6 to
75.1.,Fifteen percent of the student body had
a,Dean 8 lut average of eighty-five and only ten percent failed in one or more of their five courses.
"""Major","factor"" in the"
improved,">>chola.stic results, he pointed out, waa adoption of delayed lu.-hing until the sophomore year by fraternities."
A,more strict academic qualification for
pledgmg,"resulted in only three freshmen forced to withdraw in June, and only five on piofafttion-figures without prece- dent. * * * * * Carbondale."
III.--,"(I. P.) The achievements of the Student Council at S)uthern Illinois University are already outstanrfinK. and if the present trend ' continues, the council will undoubtedly rank anions the most efficient ever re- odxled. Thus far  the pre.sent Student Council has been instrumental in sUrting ,i svstem whereby the student may buy a $7.50 meal ticket at the student cafe- '.eria for only"
$5.,"In conjunction with the Dean of Men's office, they have sponsored an informative discussional meeting preaidmt over by representa- tives of the armed forces. The meeting was held to give as"
much,information 1- possible to students of draft age. Other plans of the Student Council include a Career Conference to be held I'tbruary 7 and
8.,".\t this conference, key figures in various industries and professions will present facts concerning job opportunities in each field of en- (Iravor."

Letters,
to,
the,
Editor,Are you one of those students whose knees turn to water
when,"you're on your way to a ""policed"""
exam?,
Have,you ever been disgusted
when,"your professor acts as if he expects you to cheat, and. consequently, watches you like a hawk every time you raise your eyes from your paper? Or have you ever been burned up when you Mudied all ninht f>>r a test and rereived a low Krade, only to find out that the gang in the back row got their hands on the test beforehand. l<<M>ked up the answers, and came through with flying colors? If your answer is yes to these questions, then we'd like to t>>Ik l<<>> you. You've probably all heard about the Scholastic"
Honor,
System.,In some ><<'h<<>><<ls (his system means that you receive your
exam,"in the mail, set a^ide two hours in the day to take the test, and mail the completed paper back to \mjr profeMsor. Of course, this kind of system is too"
much,"to h>>pe for right away, but we can start from scratch and work up to it gradually. Perhaps some of you have been fortunate enough to tak>>> some e.xam where the professor walk.- in.'hand.s out the exams, answers questions and leaves to come and go as he plea.ses. You .settle back in your chair, you gaze around the room without a proctor staring over your shoulder, go out for a"
smoke,"when you feel like it, and leave when you're finished. Pleasant .ian't it? Well, this is the Honor System that we fet-l could and should be installed at Bucknell. Okay, so you say -- Ever since I've been in grade school Ive been"
warned,anainsl
cheating.,"It was always, ""Cover your paper with your hand"", or, ""If 1 see you looking at your neighbor's paper, your test will be thrown away"". KidH of grade sch<<x>l age aren't too sure of the"
meanin<<s,"of the word.- ""hon- ei.ly*' and ""'dishonesty"
"""--",but are we children? Another
argument,"immediately conies to your mind,"
namely,
--,If a profes- sor gives a test
I,"feel i.H totally unfair, who can blame me if"
I,
cheat?,Did you t-ver examine yourself to find out if you were to
blame?,Perhaps you only tudied an hour
--,"what do you expect, a"
miracle?,
What,would you think if the professors agreed to put samples of their tests on file in the library so that all students could know what type of questions would be a.-^k.'d and what material would be
stressed?,"They do it at Harvard, so it'.^ possible to do it here. Ma) be you've rationalized about cheatinn with this argument -- Employer* l<<M>>k at grades, so"
I,ha>e to uel them
somehow.,Bui --
employers,also study character references very
carefully.,Professors who will write those refer- ences know who diws their own work and who depends on .someone else to do his sludyinR for
him.,\n emplo\er doesn't want an employee who.se honesty t i.- questionable or who trys to get bv with a bare
minimum,of the work reqyir-
etl.,\ not her a>pect to bv considered is that if an employer
knows,that you
come,from a -rhool which has a Scholastic
Honor,"System, he can be almost positive that the grades you obtained are an indication of yoar own ability, and that the qii.ilities of a sense of responsibility and honesty are ingrained in your character. .Mortar Board and"
ODK,feel that the Scholastic
Honor,System should and can be a part of our Hucknell VVav of Life. Con.setiuently. we are 100' V be- hind the committee of a few interested students and faculty
members,
who,or- ganized about a year ago to investigate the possibilities of setting up an
Honor,' System at Hucknell.
We,also feel that the students should know what has alread> been done ' toward the program. .\t least one professor in each
department,ha-* promised i to try out the Honor
System,"in his tests and rejMirt the results. In addition, the administration has promised to back the s)stem whole-heartedly if indica- tion is shown that the students themselves are ready and willing to accept tb<< nystem. Questionnaires ate being sent to various colleges in an effort to assimilate the necessary information so that different sy.stems can be"
compared,aod a
program,.set up suitable to the size of Buckn^U. We would appreciate it if all of you w<<NikI help us in your hull sessMns in the dorms and houses to get the opinions of
many,people and also to ispread the word around to other
students.,\ public forum will be held in Student Church on
No\embfr,19 when all thoes* interested are requested to
come,"and voice their opinions, good or bad- \Ve also hope that this letter has aroused your thinking to such an extent that you will r^ply in future letters giving your"
comments,about the possibility of installing the
system.,"In this way we can get a san>pling of the Voice of the .""-""tudents, which first, last, and always will determine whether the Scho- h.stic Honor System at Bucknell will succeed or fail. Sincerely, Mortar Board and"

on,subjects dealing
with,"progressive education, teaching methods, teaching problems, job placement and similai topics."
The,idea for this recently-organized
group,originated in the Elementary

and,
Doctor,
Yorke,to have such a group activity for deal- ing with topics pertinent to the field of education foi the
youngsters,of today. At a
meeting,
this,"week, Docto.- Millward, Doctor Sauvain and Doctor Beatty presented their views on ""pro- gressive education""."
The,talks were followed

"""The",

went,"on to des- ciib- the ""0*d Shoe"" tradition, while"
"""The","Time.-"" also gave a brief story of the contest itself."
TuniinR,
now,"to two of the Phila- delphia papers, we naturally find the jumniaries in"
much,"Rreater detail, as well as being given front page prior- ity in"
both,sports
sections.,The headlines in
"""The",Inquirer'
and,"in ""The"

Although,
nobody,
knows,
for,sure
who,the
anonymous,player
was,
who,wore the Old Shoe in the 1945 fraca-. of one thing
everybody,is sure: lit- was a big 'on.
Recent,investigation reveals that the
famou>,old
bn>gan,is a size 13 (that's right-- 13). The shoe was given by the Dental .\lumni Association of
Temple,as a
memoriam,to
the,
playerr,
of,both schools

made,the
supreme,sacri- fice in
World,
War,
"II,",and the trophy n 'vcr got out of the Templar.- trophy case until this year. .Members of the association thought of the idea and .sent requests for old football shoes to both schools.
When,"I lie shoes had been assembled, Dr. yesterday"" is a quote"
from,
"""The",In- ' Gerald

Timmons.,"dean of the dentai fiuiver"", which spoke of the"
Herd,"as ' nhooj, put his hand in the pile and ""an umlerdog team which came to ; lade the decision. Tejiiple Stadium and pulverized the ^ ^ ^^^s later observed that the good Templars"". Another unique excerpt .j^^tgr 5,h,,u|d have opened one ey * from this article was that there was ""no niayl>e"" about"
Jack,Maoby's five placekicks. Not to be outdone
by,"its competi- tor. ""The"
Sunday,"Bulletin"" also had plenty to"
say.,It called the first two
B.,

touchdown,"plays ""slick varia- tions of a neat trick,"" in praising the"
Bison,
offense.,
Some,other state- ments were
"""Although",
Temple,"was the cve-of-battle favorite, the contest could hardly be called an upset, not after the"
way,the
speed-happy,Buck- nell backs went about their business. Coach
Kawal,"must have in mind that the four plague backs, Oean, Albert."
"Talmage,",and
Van,
Johnson,"will be back to haunt him in next year's meet- ing of the two clubs."" ""The Bulletin"" also referred to the"
commotion,of the
B.,
U.,"fans at the end of the fray as ""mild pugilism"". .So there"
you,"have it, a cross sec- tion of"
what,some city sportswriters thought of the
way,"that our Univers- ity procured the ""Old Shoe"" for the first"
time.,Let's
hope,they will be singing the same tune about this time next year. *or. although a bronzing process gave * a degiee of
"permaiuy,","the size 1"". hoe"
was,loo large for the walnut ase which had been prepared for it. nd the ba.-^e had to he enlarged to fit the shf>e.
When,"the renovation was complet- *d, the trophy was formally put into competition at a luncheon on Alumni (lay in"
1945.,Dr.
Wallace,"Forl)es. president of the dental association, presented the shoe to Dr."
Ralph,
E.,"Page,"
who,"represented Bucknell, and President Robert"
L.,"Johnson, Temple'.^; representative."
The,
agreement,
concerning,"the trophy is that it shall be held by the winning team or until the next g""'""' i-"
played.,In the event of a tie each school holds it six months.
But,
from,"all indications,"
Temple,will have to sweat out Bucknell's new- era of Big Football before the Shoe gets back Philadelphia way. i'ictured is Hurt

The,Bisons held the 1-0 lead until late in the second quar- ter when
Temple,"began to move, scor- ing two goals in a matter of minutes The"
Owls,first goal
came,on a shot that was booted from the left side of '.he field and carried into the far right corner. Three minutes later the
Tem-,plars counted again on a shot from the .same sector of the field.

year.,

A,Bucknell fumble on their own :?:! gave the Owlets a big break which they capitalized on in short order. It was only a couple of plays later when
Capp,put on a Iwautiful exhibition <>>f broken field running as he shook off tackier after tackier in scampering 20 yards to pay dirt. Hobble- Lieu This wasn't the only bobble for the
I,"ocals during the frigid evening, for tarly in the third period history re- peated itself"
when,the Owls grabbed the pigskin again at the
same,spot. Once more it was a 20 yard tally with Harrington scoring a short time there- :ifter. In both cases Gillman
made,the place kicks for the extra jxiints.

THE,
PHILADELPHIA,
STORY,
by,
Will,
Jackson,It all
happened,
on,
Armistice,
"Day,",
1950!,
Our,
story,
begins,
in,
the,
upper,left
hand,
corner.,
A,
packed,
root-,ing section
of,
Bucknellians,
awaited,
the,
start,of
the,
Old,
Shoe,
Trophy,
classic,
in,
Temple,
Stadium.,
Some,
of,
them,
were,
smiling,
"confidently,",
some,
wer,
getting,
"restless,",
some,
were,
looking,
passively,
over,
at,
the,
Temple,
"stands,",
some,
were,
just,
looking,
around.,
To,
the,
"right,",
the,
Bison,
Band,
solemnly,
paraded,
through,
the,
streets,
of,
North,
Philadelphia.,
Their,
step,
was,
short,
and,
curt.,
They,
weren't,
the,
kind,to
celebrate,
before,
the,
final,
score,
shone,
on,
the,
elec-,tric scoreboard.
They,
remembered,
their,
half-time,
enthusiasm,last
"year,",
and,
how,
they,left
Temple,
Stadium,
with,
a,
feeling,
of,
frustration.,
Now,
the,
whistle,
blew.,
In,a
matter,
of,
minutes,
everyone,
in,
the,
stadium,
knew,
that,
the,
Thundering,
Herd,
was,
on,
the,
march.,
They,
knew,
that,
this,
year,
would,
be,
"different,",
that,
the,
Bisons,
were,
out,for
blood.,
Even,
the,
cheerleaders,
added,
more,
jest,
to,
their,
leaps,
in,
the,air.
The,
spirit,
was,
there.,
"Below,",
on,
the,
"right,",
an,
over-confident,
Temple,
fraternity,
drove,its
Homecoming,
Float,
around,
the,
city,
campus.,
They,
were,
so,
sure,
that,
the,
Big,
City,
Boys,
were,
going,
to,
win,
that,
they,
didn't,
bother,io
^o,
over,to
the,
stadium.,
They,
were,
too,
interested,
watching,
their,girl
friends,
"""Freeze",
Them,
"Out"".",
Little,
did,
they,
know!,
The,
game,
was,
hard.,
But,
the,
Bisons,
were,
harder.,
The,
jubilant,
"fans,",
below,"left,"
were,
out,
on,
the,field
tearing,
down,
the,
goal,
posts,
be-,fore the final
whistle,
had,
blown.,
There,
wasn't,
much,
the,
bewildered,
Templars,
could,
do,
about,it
either.,
A,
few,
of,
them,
half-heartedly,
ran,
over,
to,
the,
scene,
of,
the,
crime,
and,
started,
tugging,
away,
against,
the,
"""civilian""",
Herd.,
Their,
efforts,
were,
as,
successful,
as,
were,
their,
big,
brothers,
on,
the,
gridiron.,
The,
men,
who,
tore,
down,
the,
posts,
were,a
study,
in,
psychology.,
Notice,
the,
determined,
look,
on,
some,
"faces,",
the,
scorn,
on,
"others,",
the,
happy,
smiles,
on,
"more,",
and,
the,
proud,
look,
on,
the,
two,
"""Guards"".",
And,
each,
had,
an,
arm,
securely,
wrapped,
around,
the,
symbolic,
wood.,
When,
Bison,
fans,
returned,
home,
they,
passed,
the,
familiar,
store,
on,
the,
left.,
The,
score,
was,
"there,",
on,
"top,",
and,it
looked,
good.,
It,
was,a r?al
"victory,",
and,
those,
who,
saw,it
knew,
that,
twenty,
years,
from,
now,
they,
would,
be,
telling,it
to,
the,
"awed,",
young,
Bucknellians,
gathered,
around,
them,
at,

Village,
Voice,by Bill
WakeHeld,"Claire Harth, this year's editor of"
L',"Agenda, informed us last week that the Village and Buckneil Wives would each be given a page in the '51 year- book. At the first"
meeting,"of the Village Association, the possibility of putting in a"
group,picture
was,di.-s- cussed. but Claire thinks it
might,be a pretty hard task trying to get ap- proximately l.'Jo people into one pic- ture. However.
John,"Metzger. our photographer, believes that a satisfac- tory group picture can be taken since we are interested"
mainly,in getting faces into
it.,"it has been decide<l, therefore, that a picture will be taken on the steps of Davis"
Gymnasium,at 12:15 thi.s
Sunday.,"So far as we can determine, a group picture of village"
members,has never been
taken.,
S,>> let's all be at the
gym,on
Sunday,and try to
make,this
new,venture a suc- cess. .And don't f(4iget to bring all the
kids.,They'll be just as anxious to look at this picture 15 years from now as you will be ( ? ). .Michael

Engine-Ears,by
Prank,Kelly At its last meeting on
November,"9,"
the,i:ngineering Council received a general go-ahead signal for its plans
on,the film
"""Atomic",
"Physics"".",
A,discrepancy in the
method,for financ- ing the film has necessitated a delay in the final
arrangements;,but it is expected that
this,
matter,
will,be cleared up at a short
meeting,to be held on
November,
16.,
A,quick look at the situation indicates that the film will be
shown,"in the very near future and will be open to the public. The film, itself, explains the stages"
by,
which,our present
views,on the nature of matter and the structure of the
atom,have been
reached.,It has
what,"might be teimed ""an electronic- ally-studded"" cast of characters in- cluding Einstein, Frisch"
and,"Ruther- ford. The movie falls into five parts, as follows: the atomic theory; rays"
from,
atoms;,the nuclear structure; atom
smashing;,and
uranium,fission.
ME,Feast Following the
showing,"of the pic- ture ""Steam for"
"Power""","last Thurs- day, the"
ASME,held a sh(>>rt meeting at which time a committee was set-up for an
MK,banquet to be held on De- ceml)er
8.,It is
planned,to
have,a non-technical speaker.
One,of the activities
which,Tau Beta Pi has on its
agenda,is the erec- tion of a replica of their bent (key) in the lobby of the
Engineering,Build- ing. On it will be posted the names of the engineers
who,have been initi- ated by the society since its institu- tion at Buckneil. Irland Travels

Movie,
Chatter,by Babs Fiedler Heie you are a week before
Thank,"i- giving vacation,"
and,in full view of the fact that
nobody,but a sadistic fiend would give a
test,
before,"the holidays, you will have plenty of time to see the movies on the roster. At the illustrious"
Campus,"on Thurs- day is ""In"
A,"Lonely Plai-e"" with"
H.,
Bogart,
and,Gloria
Grahm.,
On,Fri- day and
Saturday,at the
Campus,is
"""The","Petty Girl"" with Joan Caulfield, and Joan Caulfield, aaand Joan Caul- field. Both pictures have been previ- ously   reviewed and are well worth seeing."
*,* * At the Capitol in Milton on Satur- day is
"""Desert",
"Hawk""",starring
Yvonne,
DeCarlo,
and,Richard Green. It's a technicolor
saga,of
a,"highly colored story in which the characters are both high and colorful. Comment: DeCarlo'tt back, and"
who,wants her? * * *
On,Friday and
Saturday,"at .Milton is ""Toast of .New Orleans"" starring"
Kathryn,
Grayson,
and,
Mario,"Lanza. It's a Cinderella Story, except Cinder- ella is a"
male,
and,
the,
fairy,"god- mother is a ""doll""."
Comment:,It's the toast of the nation.
*,* * For the request of a very special teacher-- The
Roxy,"(Spit and Whistle) will have "".Man"
From,"Colorado"" star- ring Glenn Ford"
and,
Bill,Holden.
Here,is a truly exciting and reason- ably new picture of a Civil
War,vet- eran who loses his
mind,(not spirit) and in doing so alienates his wife and best friend.
Comment:,"Psychological, not scientific"
*,"* # Not to be forgotten as a top spot in entertainment, is"
Cap,and Dagger's presentation of
Eugene,"O'Neill's ""Ah, Wilderness"", this weekend in the Lew- isburg High School .Auditorium. The plot hit.s the depths in morbidity, buw reaches the heights in"

Studies,
Continue;,
Stress,
Liberal,
College,The
Moberly,Study groups between
the,atudenl.s
and,
the,
department,heads have
done,
much,to
show,the students
how,"they can help improve the conditions in the Universities des- cribed in ""The Crisis in the"
American,"University"" by Sir Walter Moberly. Moberly's ideal of a liberal college is one of the main points of the book. His concept is that it should not be regimented for this is just defeating the purpose of preparing the student for later life. The .school should not be under, the subjection of vested interests in which certain subjects are omitted from th>>> curriculum or certain activities for- bidden because of personal or com- munity feelings. Biases should not be allowed in"
the,
class,
room.,It should be used for gaining
knowledge,and not as a sounding board for the professor's beliefs.
The,student is often to blame for the crisis of which
Moberly,is speak- ing. Too
many,people enter college only to improve their business chance.s later
on.,Colleges were not designed as vocational training schools but aa a place to learn to evaluate goals and to appreciate art and philosophy.
Many,students are guilty of having as their yoal to get his degree with the least effort. Thi.s attitude i.s re- flected in his disrespect for his teach- ers and his
tendency,
to,
memorize,rather than learning to utilize them.

McAvoy,
hizzah:,
When,a visiting Jeam's rooters invade anoJher schools stadium and out- phouts a 750(l-stronu
HometominR,"crowd, that's news. Vnd that's iusi what <KCurred"
when,roughly half of Bucknell
showed,up in Philadelphia Saturday to help yell iheir Big
Team,to the worst
HomecominR,defeat in the hil;>ry of
Temple,Iniversity. \nd this in spite of lefharKif cheerleaders
who,"had to be coaxed into the cheers mos-t of the time, and the abortive organization of the cheerinR section hv the listless Booster"
Club.,",, , ,,"
Now,"facing this thinx as objectively as possible, its obvwius that Bucknell doesn't Ro into every"
game,an 11-point underdou and thus the chances of this littlf bit ol spontaneity occuring again are unlikely. The question being
how,to keep it at its present level. The answer being support by the individual
houses,

should,
know,"the siKnili*iiiKf of the term, *i'uhlii- ("
")pininn"".","If not, we'll"
advance,a sixth-^'rade detinition : Public ( >>i)ini<>>n is
what,the
public,is
thinking,
about,a i>articular
thing.,. .
"Anyway,",it
seems,that the public will
always,
have,an
opinion,of college
students.,
This,
opinion,
varies,
from,
time,
to,time.
Right,
now.,we're
entering,an era in
which,public
opinion,is
quick,to
swing,against college students.
Ouring,the last war. a lot of
people,
resented,the fact that
some,
young,
men,
were,
attending,college while others of the
same,
age,
were,fighting the
war.,.\nd it looks like a
recurrence,of the s.ime thing is on its
way-,
The,
purpose,"of this editorial,"
"however,",isn't to tell
what,the public doesn't like
about,college
students.,
We,
just,
used,"the ""draft"
"dodger""",
handle,for an
example.,
W,c
belong,to a gri-uj) that i> \ery carefully
watched.,
News,
from,the
campus,is usually treated in a slightly
sensational,
man-,ner. esi)eoially
when,the nt-w-^ is
bad,news.
Last,
week,the largest
weekly,
newspaper,in the
"world,",one that serves over a half-million
American,"families,"
came,out
with,the
following,lead
sentence,to a
too-long,story: *#|''our lUn knell

proved,to be the
vanguani,of
more,"stuilent news, as this"
week,
witnessed,five
more,
inxdhed,in
two,autoinol>ile
"accidents""",
The,effect of that story set
tongues,
wagging,all
over,the
country.,
The,
words,on
many,lips
were:,
"""Those",
Bucknell,kids are
going,"wild with their father's care"". It's a >!ianu' that the .iccidcnls"
hajipened.,< 'ur accidents did
seem,to rate
more,
news,signitic.mc* than
non-college,
student,"ac- cidents, but still"
they,h.ippened. It is our
humble,
opinion,that the
average,college senior
who,is
permitted,to
own,an
automobile,is just as
good,a driver as the next guy.
But,
we,
have,to take it
upon,
ourselves,to
prove,it!

Comparing,the mind of the typical
freshman,"""lo a completely disorganized machine shop in which all tools, large and small are thrown in a conglomerate heap in the middle of the floor,"""
Dean,Jtobert
C.,DisQue of the Drexel Institute of Technology
emphasized,"the need for teaching >oung people how to study. ""The critical"
weakness,"of engineering college freshmen is their inability to organize, master and retain any considerable body of"
knowledge.,"Passing tjui/zes and examinations becomes a pure game of chance, whereas it ought to be a certainty within the broad range of passing grades,"" Dean Disque said. ""The fundamental technique of studying is to organize the materials to be mastered as clearly and dehnitely as to<>>ls are"
organized,in
a,"well operated machine shop. This technique can be taught and it can be acquired. ""To learn to study,"" he continued, ""a"
young,person
must,"realize that reading is not studying, understanding is not mastery; and to learn to organ- ize, and thus to retain by asxiciation a constantly increasing body of funda- mental professional infonnatifm. "".Many educators are practicing something of a fraud upon their students. They like to repeal the importance of the ability to think and the relative un- importance of actual"
knowledge.,
When,they set quizzes and examination* Ihey re(|uire what seems to the students to Im- miracles of
memory.,"In point of hard fact, no thinking is possible without siMuething t(>> think about, and that something is a body of"

What,is lacking In the relations between students and faculty on our

There,"are a few affairs organized to further student-fajulty relations, but the main trouble is that these ai-e orpaiuz.-'d. not spontaneous,"
and,few students take
advantage,of the oppor- tunities. Why don't more of us sign

2,by Clyde .Mc.\voy The wind blew cold across Wilming- ton's ball park on
November,isth last as Delaware's ruffled Blue
Hens,laid a 1 ig goose egg whilst the batterin' Bisons of Bucknell were banging out their fourth consecutive win and the finale of their second successful sea- son under
Harry,Lawrence. Confining the Herd's scoring bids to two first perictd TD's by
Meyers,and HeUsko and
a,
conversion,
by,"Jack Maeby, the plucky Hens played heads up defensive ball for three scoreless"
periods.,
They,"themselves were un- able to go further than the 7-yard line on one occasion against the powerful Bison defensive eleven, which allowed only 9<) yards from scrimmage. Fourteen Bucknell seniors, all of"
them,key
men,
bowed,out in the last college
game,of their career. They were:
ALE.X,
DUPLICKI.,fiery defen- sive guard;
BILL,
"FRANKE,",hard- hitting end;
WALT,
"HALL,",big defen- sive end;
DICK,
HETSKO.,powerful

RICHIE,
"JOHNSON,",defensive back and co-captain ?2D
"KIKLY,",

CHET,
"LEACH,",diminutive scatback;
DOUG,

JACK,

ANDY,

BILL,
"SZABO,",

Mill.,
"WRABLEY,",
strong,offensive center.
ARNE,
"PECHULIS,","co-captain and last year's All-American,"
was,unable to play his last
game,because of in- juries sustained in an automobile ac- cident. Stalling off the
campaign,with a so-so win over Gettysburg and losses to
"Muhlenberg,","Lehigh, and Colgate, the Herd thundered back into top con- tention in the East with consecutive wins (three of"
them,"shutouts) over I^fayette,"
"NYU,",
"Temple,",
and,Dela- ware. A trip to
Washington,
&,Jeff- erson also paid otf in a
muddy,.'}4-i) victory. But the
factors,
that,really set tongues clicking in Philadelphia sports circles were the Herd's -35-0 lambast- ing of the powerful
Temple,eleven at the Owl's
Homecoming,"and the strong ."".bowing of the Bisons in the final -All-East statistics where they placed three times in the offensive and de fensive ratings."
The,
plundering,
Herd,
was,rated third only to Princeton and
Army,in rushing offense with an average of 258.1 yards per game.
They,also
nabbed,"the 3rd spot in rushing defense, allowing 103.2 yards a"
game,on the
ground.,Princeton and Lehigh (not bad
company,either) were Lst and 2nd in this field. Total defense
showed,
Army,( 179.6 yards per
game),and Cornell (215.1) up top in
this,
category,
with,the
Lawrencemen,"right within, tackling distance with a 3rd place 218.(3 yardi per game. Joe Mason'.- heavy foot was not to be denied either for the 180 lb. junior kicked his way into the"
permanent,.^th place slot as Anny's fabulous iilaik faded fast in the last two games. Mason's punts averaged 38.6 yards.

Horaoe,
A,Hildri'th told
members,of the
tampu>,Club at their meeting
November,21 in Hunt Hall.
Quuting,l>r.
Henry,
Wriston,of
Brown,"University, president of the Association of"
American,"Universities, 1 1. Hildreth said that a large per- centage of educational institutions of higher learning are operating in the red during the current fiscal year. Hucknell is not one of tho.se"
who,are
endangering,their financial fu- tures by
adopting,
such,
emergency,
"measures,",
the,University executive
declared.,
He,expressed
hope,that the college
would,not be forced to operate in the red before the books are closed
on,the present academic year next June.
When,"speaking of fraternities and sororities on campu.>. President Hil- dreth said, ""Those organizations which play such a large part in the life of students raise iiuestion?."""
Quota,System One of the problems he talked about
was,the increase in
women,students this year and next in relation to the ^ sorority nuota
system.,"""With the in-"
j,crease in
number,of girls we should do
something,to see that
more,girls
who,"wish to enter sororities can do 50,' he .suggested. .\nother problem raised was that of fraternities-- their rushing system and yearly positiotis. ""It"
seems,"to me that we have a bad system,"" he stated."
He,then went on to explain that im- mediate pledging would solve the ex- pense of the dining
hall,
and,also
equalize,fraternities
through,the years (that is t<> say
--,one fraternity
would,not remain on top year after year). If this
system,
was,"not agreeable, deferred rushing to the second semes- ter would achieve the"
same,results
ami,
improve,scholastic >-tandinK. he
add.d.,
He,"concluded the fraternity (juestion by saying, ""I certainly rec- ommend that if a military situation"
should,"ari-se,"
and,
the,fraternities again should come to the college for financial
aid--,"before their property is returned, deferred or immediate rush- ing be thoroughly considered."
Turning,to the future. President Hildreth predicted that the male en- rollment will drop considerably during the next
few,"years,"
and,advised an increase in
the,
female,enrollment. He expressed the university's hope to have an
R.,
O.,
T.,
C.,unit of some .sort on
campus,"next year, and"
announced,thai plans for an Air
R.,
O.  T.,
C.,are now well underway.
Had,
Money,
"""To",use even a small portion of
what,is at best an inadequate endow ment in order to n\eet current operat- ing expenses would be to jeopardize the competitive position of the Uni- versity for years to
come.,"Such a step will not even be considered at Bucknell,"" Dr. Hildreth stated."
Much,as colleges
and,universities
would,like to turn their attention to
more,"constructive matters, the con- stant cheapening of the dollar has"
made,the financial
problem,of para- mount importance for educational in- stitutions as well as for churches and hospitals. Dr. Hildreth pointed out.
"""The","first obligation of any college is to provide good teaching,"" he con- tinued. ""To fulfill this obligation, it is"
necessary,to
maintain,
a,faculty salary level that will attract and hold the ablest teachers.
"""While",w<> would like to meet the
many,"physical needs of the campus, our most important problem is to ful- fill our financial obligations to a loyal and"
competent,"faculty. ""At Bucknell. fhe pr#>><<<<ure of th >"

conducting,while di- recting his group.
The,"music heard was interesting, if not tired,"
and,possessed elements de- sirable for a concert
of,
this,"type. Possibly the music was unsuitable for the occasion, but this writer did not think so. Players Diverse"
Glinka's,
Russian,
and,l.udmilla Overture
began,the program.
Always,"diverting in effect, this"

work,with cleancut precis- ion right
from,its
ominous,yet tran- quil beginning to the wildly trium- phant finale.
The,first
music,
played,"after th"" intermission"
was,
Wagner's,Siegfried Idyll. This music is a subdued
Wag-,"ner for the most part and is slightly reniini.scent of his last music  drama,"
Parsifal.,"This was excellently per- formed. F.nding the evening's concert, Mr. Stewart and the Baltimore"

played,
Richard,Stiauss's ever popular Till F^ulenspiegal's .Merry

work,"is full of sur- prises, humor and bombastics and as such received a full treatment by the orchestra."

the,"hoard>, the Regi.strar added. brought out the fact that the mos* important area of the world today in this pre.sent world situation, with the exception of the actual territories of"
armed,"conflict, is"
Western,"Europe. European Defense First The defense of Europe is nece.ssary as we have found out from past wars. ""United States cannot exist as an in dependent state if Europe is under the control of a hostile nation"", so .Mr. Williamson said. He asserted thai the Soviet"
I,nion can
push,"but- tons in .Moscow and get control of all the satellite armies, but that the French, British, and N'orwegian coun- tries are independent of our contiol, and thus we are unable to control their armies. .Mr."
Williamson,intimated that this ilitTerence between Russian and
Amer-,ican  foreign policy was often times not taken into consideration in the public criticism of
U.S.,foreign policy.
He,"concluded by stating that the most basic and pertinent question ti l>e asked <-oncerning Western Europe's future was ""the nature and extent of German armament?"" However, Mr. Williamson pointed out that we would not impose a federal system (a United States of Europe) on"
Western,"Eui opt- by military or e<""onomic coersion.. Radio Broadcasts Monday's program included class- iiMtni seminars and a panel discussion over radio stations"
WKOK,and
WHR.,Col.
Theodore,
Freeman,"talked on thi' ""Mutual Defense .Assistance Pro- gram"";   .Mr. Williamson again spok<' on "".American Foreign Policy in F^urope""; and Mr. Swan spoke on ""The Voice of America"". .Mr. Swan quoted from the"
UNESCO,"charter ""since"
war,
begins,
in,the minds of men. in the minds of men peace
must,
"begin.""",
He,also said that if people
know,"the truth, that truth will"
make,
them,free. Also on
.Monday,Dr.
Francis,Bull
spoke,on
Norwegian,literature. He gave som<<' very
inspiring,lectures
on,"""Main-"

and,
"""Hemik","Fergelan<l,"

Can,you afford to have the Russians come in here and
make,"slaves of us?"""
On,
Monday,evening a radio panel discussion
was,
held,
on,"""Defense"
Against,
"Communism"".",".Mr. Swan, Col. Freeman, and Mr. Colton partici- pated in the discussion. Each of the speakers reviewed the ideas that they had"
brought,forth in the day's lec- tures. Mr.
Swan,"ended the panel by stating that if we cannot do anything else, we as individuals can try to be- come better individuals, so that we will present a good and healthy ex- ample."
Round,Tables Thi-
progiam,on
Tuesday,contained seminars
and,a radio panel discus- sion and a round table discussion. In the
morning,.Mr.
Simpson,
spoke,on the
"""Work",of EC.\ and its relation ship to
European,
"Recovery"".",Mr.
Simpson,said.
"""An",
advance,"of com- munist forces in P^urope to<lay would gain all Europe for Russia, save pos- siHy the Biitish Isles."" In contrast- ing the"
ECA,"countries to the satellites behind the Iron Curtain, Mr."
Simpson,felt that the Iron Curtain countries would eventually crumble due to op- pression. He said that it is as.sumed that industrial production efforts are being
made,"in these countries, but not to the degree that they are in the'"
V.VA,countries. Mr. I'hilipse spoke on the
"""Econom-",ic Situation in the
"Netherlands"".",He said that the
Western,
European,coun- tries would not be willing to take on
re-armament,"by themselves, and that they would only do it with help from us. .'Vlso in the morning. .Mr. Tohn-- ton spoke on"
"""Problems",Involved in the Starting and Opeiation of the
ECA,
"Program"".","Mr. lohnsti-i brought out that no nation \i alon capable of defending themselve- against the Soviet Union, and the United States confronted by threat, must, as leader, contribute its share against these aggressions."
He,also said that in doing this the I'nited States is straining itself to the break- ing point.
"""Our","public debt is enor mous."" .Mr. Johnston says that we will be averaging our standard ""f living to that of Europe and Asia. .Strengthen Europe"
A,".seminar on ""Should there be ;< strong"
"Germany?""",
was,"held between Mr. Colton and Mr. Gafencu. .Mr. Gafencu said,"
"""We","must try to have -i very strong Europe and thus build up Germany's forces to help have a united Europe"". In the radio panel discussion in the afternoon Dr. Phil- ipse, Mr. Johnston, .Mr. Simpson, Mi. Gafencu. and Mr. Colton discussed th< ""Economic Rebuilding of Westei i. Europe"". .Mr. Simpson brought out that ""industrial recovery in Western"
Europe,"has been epectacular"". .Mr. Johnston pointed out the difficulties of uniting Europe which consists of many different countries with"
many,"different religions, languages, curnn- cies, and historical backgrounds. .Mr. Gafencu said that the Russian; prohibited the Marshall Plan in East- ern   Europe, and she substituted th'> Molotov Plan for it. This plan en- ables  Russia to take all she can out of Eastern Europ''- It is a ""syste- matic   starvation plan of the whole <'ountry for the purpose of the Molo tov Plan"". Mr. Simpson said ""the only"
way,Europe can
come,"back i<< t"" try to"
compete,with
American,"indus- tries.    They have to get on their feet and olV our hacks."" Closing Monday's ses.'<<ions a round table discussion wa^ held on questions relating to diplo- macy   and recovery problems. Mr. Colton and Mr."
Gafencu,"lead this dis cussidn at the president's home. ReliKoiis End On Wednesda\ the conference drew to a close with three classroom sem- inars and the Chapel speech on ""Oper- ation   'Recovery' in Europe"" by Mr. Colton He said ""after"
World,
War,11 there was a
vacuum,of
power,"left in F^urope""."
Now.,".Mr. Colton says, that the anxiety in most minds across the world is will the Russian <ibjectives prove such as to provocate war by .Moscow? The objective is dear -- namely, to establi.sh"
communist,"domi nated governments in Italy, France. .\u>tria, and"
Germany.,"""(Joveinments that will progressive- ly destroy the old leadership, the cul- ture, and will emphasis the economic.-- of the w'omniunist revolution in th"" current"
game,"of world politics."" Mos- cow wished to prevent the lecovery of"
Western,"Europe, even to worse con- ditions for idleness, hunger, and dis- ease are the conditioning crisis that p.tpare a people ft)r the nistoric mo- ment or revolution. So,"
many,of the problems and pos sible solutions for
Western,Europe were brougl\t out in this very success- ful conference.
Those,that partici- pated and listened to the conferenco found
much,"to profit from, and plans are"
now,in the back of .some minds for another conference on world af- fairs next year.

The,

was,
born,in the
early,"1930's,"
when,
people,
were,
"starving,",
business,

were,
losing,faith in

The,

the,l'J40's
when,
the,
world,
was,
wondering,
what,it

.\nd,
now,
the,

laced,
with,
the,
problem,
of,
studying,
in,
the,face of an

Our,

the,first
American,
generation,
since,
the,
1790's,that
was,
born,
and,
grew,
up,in an
atmosphere,of
depression,
and,

Our,

doesn't,

whether,
there,
will,
be,
another,

we,
just,
wonder,
when.,"h"""
we,

A,lot of
us,
have,
taken,a
negative,
attitude.,
Let's,
have,
fun,
today,
and,
not,
worry,
about,
tomorrow.,It's
an,
escapist,
philoso-,phy that
has,
pervaded,
the,

for,
the,last

We,can't face

We,
can't,

looked,

He,
remarked,
that,

vour,little friends are
wrong.,
They,
have,
been,affected
by,the
skepticism,of a skeptical
age.,
They,do not believe except
they,
see.,
They,think that
nothing,can be
which,is not
comprehensible,by their little minds. All
"minds,","Virginia,"
whether,they be men's or children'.s are little. In this great universe of ours
man,is a
mere,"insect, an ant, in his intellect, as"
compared,with the
boundless,
world,"about him, as"
measured,
by,the intelli- gence capable of
grasping,the
whole,of truth and
knowledge.,"Yes. Virginia, there is a Santa C'laus."
He,exists as certainly as love and
Reneru.ity,
and,
devotion,"exist,"
and,y-.u
know,that
they,
abound,
and,
give,to
your,life its
highest,
beautv,and
joy.,Alas!
how,
dreary,
would,be
the,world if there
were,no .Santa
Claus!,It
would,be as
dreary,
as,if there
were,"no \iiginias. There would be no childlike faith  then, no poetry, no"
romance,to hiake tolerable this existence.
We,"should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be ex- einguishi-d. Not believe in Santa"
Claus!,You might as well not believe in fainesl
You,"might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Chnst- nias eve to catch .Santa Claus. but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that"
prove'?,
Nobody,se9s Santa (laus. but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are tho^e that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the
lawn?,Of course not. but that's no proof that they are not there.
Nobody,"can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world. You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but ! there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest"
"man,",nor even the united strength of all the strongest
men,"that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory"
beyond.,Is it all
real?,"Ah. Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding. No Santa"
Claus!,
Thank,"God he lives, and he lives forever."
A,thousand years
from,"now, Virginia, nay, ten times he will continue to"
make,glad the heart of childhood. The

I,have just liegun to realize that

what,Mrs.

and,
I,went
thniugh,sev- eral years
ago.,
Maybe,the following
poem,might help.

I,can per- haps be of further help. Rev. Irvin

December,"3, 19.50 To The F>litor: Several week> ago a professor, af- ter vainly"
attempting,
to,
get,"sonv? class respon.se to one of his (juestions,"
commented,"with some initation, ""Y'ou must be asleep, dead, or"
dumb;,
I,can't tel'
"which!""","This point-, up a vital"
problem,in our
classes-why,won't students participate in
a,cla.ssr<j<mi
discussion?,"Professors tend to blann? the students, but"
I,think there i.s
much,to be said in our behalf.
Many,of the courses
we,"take are lecture courses. In fact from elemen- tary scho<>>l onward, we have been ac- customed to having a faculty-dominat- ed classroom."
We,have rarely been permitted to express our
own,ideas but have been forced by lack of time and the need to cover the
maximum,
amount,"of material before examina- tions to accept without question the statements of our professr)rs. , In other words we have been condi- tioned through our classroom experi- ence to the lecture"
method.,Once in a while discussion
may,"develop, but"
through,the years
we,have accepted the passive role of listeners rather than active participants in a discu.^- si(in.
"Secondly,",the student fears that
by,
speaking,
up,he will
display,hi.-
own,
ignorance,in the subject
and,will be
penalized,
both,
by,his
unsympathetic,
classmates,
and,
an,
equally,
unsympa-,thetic professor.
Any,.sarcasm a stu- dent must take
from,a so-called hu- morous profes.sor
naturally,discour- ages any further venture of opinion.
"Thirdly,",
some,
professors,
ask,"such vague, general questions that it is im- possible for"
any,
student,
to,
respond,intelligently.
I,even question in
many,ca.ses
whether,
the,
professor,is clear (See

The,idea of
an,"integrated courst entitled ""Oriental Culture"""
was,sug- gesteil by a statement
made,
by,"Mi. Oliver Caldwell,"
U.,
S,
Department,"of State, at the ban()U('t of the Hurma- Bucknell"
Conference.,
He,said that
any,
American,citizen
who,considers himself educated would have to knosv a great deal about the thought and the culture of the
Orient.,"For in- stance, no one can deal satisfactorily with the people of the Orient unlesi they"
know,
the,essential
ideas,and practices of Buddhism.
.A,group of
the,
members,
of,"the Bucknell faculty, realizing that there are already in the curriculum several courses dealing"
with,
the,
Orient,in more or less
fragmentary,"ways, have considered the idea that it would be possible to poll these courses and help students to develop a"
much,
more,in- tegrated picture of Oriental civiliza- tion. An experimental course in integrat- ed education is offered
during,the second
semester.,"This is a course in Oriental Civilization. It will comprise a rapid survey of the cultural develop- nient of (Jhina and India and a more detailed study of the modern period of Chinese, Indian. Japanese,"
and,Bur-
mese culture.,"# Students should register for History 234. Religion 200,"

man,

to,the Kastein I.eague champion.-hip last season. One soj/homore is expected to break into the
lineup.,
He,is Frank Mc- Phee; a guard vsho averaged .10 points per game as a
freshman.,"Another sophomore possibility is Dave Sisler, son of George Sisler, the celebrated baseball man. Other players"
who,"probably will form the starting five are: Dick Kaz- tnair, the football halfback,"
who,is expected to team
with,
McPhee,"at guard; and Kd Keed, six feet three center, and one of the two seniors on the ..-quad. Saturday night the Herd will bounce over to Bethlehem, Pa., to do battle with the Engineers of Lehigh Univer- sity. Coach Anthony Packer, new to the Brown and White varsity, is at- tempting to put his dribblers on the ladder to success with an immen.se reluilding program. Highlighting"
the,"scjuad. which boasts six lettermen, will be co-cap- tains Dick Gratten"
and,
Tom,"Von- Vtit'ch. Both are forwards and. over tw.. seasons, have maintained game averages of 9.6 points and 9.7 points lespecvively."
"""Von","Vertlch;"" says Coach Packer, ""ha> been the outstand- ing post-war player at I.#high."" In a series which"
began,
in,"1!*01. the Herd has managed to down the Kn- gineers 12 times while they succumb- who led 11) scoring last season: Walt Ashbaugh, Paul Gerwin. Fred Eydt, and John Werner. The.se four, with Rog Chadwick, who is also available again, scored N46 of the lied's 1421 points in 1^49-50. Under Coach Royner Greene, Cor- nell is a two-platoon type of team. This accounts for the fact that p<)int- scoring is well spread out over the s()uad. Couch Greene has been in charge for five years and has estab- lished quite a tradition at Lake Cayu- ga. Last year Cornell finished the Ivy I^-ague race in a third place tie with Vale, in spite of the fact that it won eighteen of twenty-one games. The Red will probably operate with three of last year's scoring leaders, Kydt, Gerwin, and Ashbaugh, in the' starting five, and will reserve Werner, who stands six-four, for second pla- toon duty. Eydt, who also sUnds six-four, vrill be the tallest men <<>>n"
the,"starting five. .Ashbaugh, at center, is six-one. Gerwin. at guard, six-two, Hugh Mac- Neil, at guard, is also about the same height. Coach Greene's two-plat(>>on system stres.ses tight defensive play. As a tribute to thi- system, last season Cornell held its opponents to an aver- age <>>f 48.9 points"
per,
game,"while scoring o6.s. It will, indeed. Ik- a rough road trip for the Herd, and if they can down the two Ivy League leaders, it may not be the suic de it was planned t>) be."

When,"the Saturday Evening; I'ost came out on N'oveinher ""ioth, many of it.s faithful .subscribers were sliifhtly amazed and some even amu.sed to find the cover picturing: a well-known col- iejfe football referee in that well- kiiuwii picjiie position -- flat"

1949.,Th<'

The,"Fre.shman ba.sketball team opened the 19.50 basketball season with a thrilling 47-4>>> victory over the Juniata Junior Varsity. With less than 25 seconds to go, and Bucknell trailing"
by,
1,"point, Barry Parker sank a two handed jump shot from the left side of the foul circle for the triumph. The opening seconds of the game were a preview of the"
manner,in which the entire contest was to be
ved.,"It was a see-saw struggle iroin the very outset, with the Baby Bisons holding their greatest margin midway of the .second period, 2'2-ll. The"
teams,
were,"not as evenly matched as the score indicated, for the Juniata Juniors displayed a keen inaccuracy as far"
as,shooting wa.s concerned. With Bob Seigal and Jim PotT <loing most of the .scoring and JefT Minott filling the all important Idle of play

the,"freshmen jumped to a 17-10 first <|uarter lead. The second quarter found the Lane- men pulling swiftly away to their largest margin, 22-11.

I,"the game at 4(i-40. Jim PotT. who was the sparkplug ' for the frosh and high scorer for the contest, committed his fifth foul and had to leave the game. From this point to the end of the contest, the teams were never more than 2 points apart. Juniata sank a foul shot and went ahead, 41-40. JefT .Mynott drove in from the left side and threw in an under handed layup to put Buckn>>>>ll ahead, 42-41. Bucky Hackett of Juniata was fouled and made the toss giKKl, to again knot the .score.

SUNDAY,
DINNER,(Jl
ESTS,
Campus,
Quizzer,by Elaine
Vouyoukas,
The,question for this
week,was:
Do,
you,think
men,
and,
women,.stu- dents .should dine together?
I,decided to ask this question aftei
I,noticed a
number,of our coeds were <<iuite reluctant to put on their best bib
and,
tucker,for
Sunday,dinner. Their reason was to me quite logical;
why,should we dress to the teeth with ne'er to see us but four waiters who \
Westinghouse,"Elevator Division Plant see us Friday or Saturday night with t^p ,,pv\-"
New,York Port Authority should be
made,through
Jack,"Hort- man, *;enior,"
who,
may,be contacted at EC122. Slightly foot
sore,
and,"definitely broke, the Senior"
MEs,have returned
from,their
annual,
inspection,trip.
Taking,
advantage,of the opportuni- ties offered by the
ASME,convention in
New,
York,"City, the trip consisted of visits to several industrial plants in the vicinity, sitting in on various technical sessions at the convention and a visit to the annual"
Power,Show held in Grand Central Palace. Indu.strial sites visited
were,"thf Hires Root Beer Bottling Plant, th. our hair up"
anyhow?,"So to attempt a mild pun, let's put our hair"
down,girls and decide the issue. .My first inquiry brought this hope-
|,"ful yet practical reply. ""It would be"
j,"nice to look across the table at a man. ' but there isn't a big enough dininp: room for all !>>tudcnts to eat together."" So sa.veth a wise and well-diessed"
woman,on
campus,-- Jill
Kriebel.,"| This presented a problem, so 1 ' went to .Mrs."
Long,"to look for the; solution. She, if anyone, -hould know- all the answers, having leigned over the dining"
room,for
many,a year.
i,Her
answer,
was,an
emphatic,"Nol | ,\nd"
I,<<iuote:
""".Nol",
Boys,"in general | !ike heavier food than girl.<<."" Speak- \x\K of ff>od, our food is not exactly, the light variety at"
times.,"Pie ala lode, cake, etc.. la da"

j,"I then asked a handsome, husky"
I,"football player what he thought of ' the situation. Ht boiled the subject ilown to seven words exactly. ""Good idea, get to know more people."" Hm-in. People? Let's be more defi- > .#-*,#. '"

when,the Theta Chi's took over he was evicted. Lew- ipburg was <|uite a change from Shak- er Heights since there were no street- light-s here and it
was,necessary to xairy a flashlight. Perhap.s

A,research fellow in
geography,at the University of
Maryland.,He returned to Buckneli this year and holds the po.<ition
of,
associate,
professor,of

chairman,of the de- partment.
Aside,
from,"climatology,"
he,has
other,
research,
interests.,
Among,
them,are
geomorphology,
(study,of
topogiaphy),
and,land utilization of
Ihe,

know,the Brand.** for hospitality ex- tended in r)pen houses for
geography,"jstudents."" This friendly gesture on their part has done"
much,in helping to
promote,inter-student and student-
ENGINE-EARS...,faculty relationships. 'iidergraduale
work,
was,
done,al
Kent,"State University in (Jhio, and his master's degree in"
geography,"was obtained al the L'niversity of Chicago, after which he attended the Univers- ity of Wisconsin for one and a half"
years.,"At Penn College in Cleveland, he wa.-^ in charge of"
geography,and was senior advisor of the I'enn Per- .sonnel
Development,
Department.,He a<<iuired a thorough educational back- ground v.hiie '-onnected
with,public school
teaching,
and,administration for 17
years.,During the war he was occupied
with,
army,"ordinance, air- craft engineering"
and,"teaching geo- graphy to an airforce unit. In 19 46, Professor Brand ';am>> here to inaug- urate the"
geography,department.
This,professor is
kept,
busy,with his
many,clubs and association
mem-,berships. .Among the honors confer- red upon
him,"were a scholarship at the l'niversity of Wi.-consin, a grad- uate research fellowship at the Uni- versity of Maryland, as well as being liste<l in the latest issue of Who's V\ ho In the"
East.,
By,"the way, the DU's on"
campus,should all take a course in
geogiaphy,since Professor Brand is a fraternilv brother of theis.

work,
with,

One,"doesn t meet people as readily al ""Pardoe's"" as at the ""Bison"", so"
I,shall now con- centrate on tactics
I,have observed at the latter. If on a
Monday,a cu-ed finds her
weekend,
program,"empty,"
the,first thing she must do is look at her .sched- ule for free
hours.,She should then find a
companion,
who,has the same hours open and
make,an
appointment,with her for a certain
time.,This is not quite as simple as you
may,think. All free hours are
not,
good,"hours. For exartiple,"
I,have concluded that ten and eleven are the best hours for the
morning,"shift, while four o'clock to five-thirty are the most advantag- eou.- hours for the afternoon shift. Still, the hour is not the only prob- lem. It is an accepted fact that this place is most crowded just before and just after the hour, since both those coming from and going to classes are there. So, we"
may,conclude that the most
advantageous,
times,
would,"be 10:02, 11:02. 4:32, and 5:32. If a girl is lucky enough to have the aforesaid times open, is not at too great a dis- tance from the Bison, meet> her friend at exactly the right time, and"
makes,her entrance
two,
minutes,"past the houi , her chances for a"
weekend,date are excellent.
Now,"1 shall proceed to tell of Bison etiiiuette, for if a girl arrives at the right"
"moment,",but
doesn't,
use,"the proper procedure, her efforts will be"
One,"girl should order their coffee, while the other circulates around, not looking at"
anybody,"in particular, but giving the"
groups,
the,
once,over. Once she has the general grouping set in her mind she should go to that por- tion o the
room,"in which she knowj .somebody, the part which she thinlcs will prove successful. If there are no"
empty,"tables at her first choice, she should choose the next best. (As you"
may,"have gathered, one of the advan- tages in"
coming,right after the hour is the choice of tables.)
Once,"they are seated at the table, a friendly smile or turn of the ey<< will do the trick (feats to be prac- ticed long hours at"
home,in front of the
mirror).,"Carry on a witty con- versation, generally"
enjoy,"yourself, and the men will be yours for the ask- ing. The aforesaid statements are based on personal experience"
and,the ex- peiience of others in the
house.,"If you follow these rules faithfully, you"
may,be sure that you will achieve the ultimate goal of all girls.

Says,
Chapel,
Speaker,
Ethan,
Colton,"hy (leorice \Vo<<>>dHard ""Operations 'Recovery' in"
"Europe""",*was the subject of Dr. Ethan Colton's
Chapel,talk
yesterday.,Dr. Colton is an authoi- and lecturer
who,"has studied Europe first hand for the pa.st 8C years. GoinK back into history, Europe was a country of"
many,"powers, but the"
power,situation has been altered by two countries
--,
Kngland,"and Russia. .AlthouRh Hussia has been constant- ly expanding: and is at present mak- inp such an effort, there is no eminent danger of Russia in a"
war.,The Rus- sian plan of strategy is rather one of waiting until the right
moment.,Their philosophy is that every country has a
weak,
"moment,",and that is the mo- ment to 'move in'.
Narrowing,
down,the real issue be- tween the Lnited States
and,"Russia is this business of the ""historic mo- ment"". Russia"
would,"prefer to see countries suffer, that they"
may,reach a point of willingness to
succumb,to
her.,
lnited,".States,"
on,
the,"other hand, would attempt to keep the un- derdogs healthy, so that they need not give in to Russia. This battle of the ""historic"
"moment""",has been
won,
by,
the,
recovery,of
Europe.,But there
must,"be a con- tinual effort to hold spiritual condi- tions of Europe at a good level. Rus- sian armies, if activated, would have to fight on ground largely sympathetic to Democratic ideology, in opposition to"
Communism.,"If the greatest de- mocracy of them all does not make an effort at welfare and continual recov- ery, we"
might,as
well,
attempt,to come to peace terms with Russia now.
The,"important thing is for us, as students, to give the spiritual under- girding to"
what,has
been,
done,by
diplomat-.,"In history, churchmen and religious laymen were tho.>*e who stood strong against the forces of tyranny."
As,"Christian students, we must give"
Europe,as
much,of a spiritual foun- dation as we possibly
can.,
The,hard pressed churches and religious organ- izations of
Europe,need niaterial artd
moral,
support.,
An,acceleration of or
"""economy",of the
kingdom,"of God"" will be one of the greatest factors of resistance in Europe."
When,"scK'ial orders are shaken, th>>* church is the institution that stands most .stable. If"
God,"is placed hefor,. the State, the moral power that backs up military strength is"
assured.,The saving salt of any nation is its spirit- ual force.

Speaking,before a packed house at the annual
Christmas,
Chapel,yester- day. President
Horace,
A.,Hildreth asked students for
their,
own,".-ake ""not to allow"
themselves,to become indiflferent (about school
work),and to accumulate a record which will be
more,harmful than helpful in future years.
"However,",the President stated thai
he,did not
speak,"unsynipathetically, for he realizes that the military situ- ation causes"
a,restlessness
that,is hard to overcome.
He,pointed out to those subject to the draft that the record a student
makes,
now,can be either of helpful or
harmful,influence in later years.
"""You",cunn<it
afford,
because,of stress
and,"strain to let yourselves fall into indifferent, shiftle.ss habits."
and,"even downrijfht laziness, because of concern . . that in a few months you will be in uniform"", he asserted."

Drivers,
Barred,Clarification
of,
the,University'^ policy on student use of automobiles
was,brought to the attention of th- student body by President Horace
A.,Hildreth preceding the Christmas pro
gram,"presented by the Chapel Choir yesterday morning. ""Before"
commencing,oui- service of Christmas music this
morning,
I,have an
announcement,that it seems wist to
make,at this time for 1 shall not be on the
campu>,"the first chapel af- ter Christmas,"""
President,"Hildreth Policy Clarified ""1 want to clarify the policy of the University about the use of automo- biles by students. Just prior to"
my,
coming,"here, the Trustees adopted a policy which reads as follows: "" 'Beginning in September, 1949, no"
member,"of the freshman, .sophomore, or junior clas.ses will be permitied to have a motor vehicle at Bucknell Uni- versity except"
by,very special pei - mission ff the Car Permit Committee. This regulation does not apply to the
commuters.,
The,use of motorcycles is prohibited.'
"""Although",the
language,
does,not specifically say so it
was,"the intent of the Trustees that permission should Im* given only to male -tudents. Un- fortunately in the handbook, ambigu- ous language was again u.sed in the rule"
about,"automobiles, leaving the implication that"
women,as well as men could apply for
permits.,
I,want to i-all the attention of the .>tuden' body to the fact that the policy of the Trustees has not been
changed,"and. other than conmiuters, only male stu- dents of the University"
may,"apply for permits to use automobiles. Accident Plague ""Recently we have been plagued by a series of automobile accidents, and the"
dean,of
men,
was,about to take drastic action
when,
the,flood and slonn descended on
L<<wisburg.,This meant that iwany students came bac<< by automobile or had automobiles in- 1 apacitated here on the campus. With Christmas so near at hand we did not
want,to put the students to the ex- pense of
taking,
their,automobile-
home,by an extra trip so close to the time
when,they
would,be returning
home,"for the holiday vacation. ""In order to"
reduce,
the,
risk,"of further automobile accidents, this is fair"
warning,to the student body that f<illowing
the,
Christm.is,"vacation, checks of automobiles will be made"
more,"frequently,"
and,
these,checks will be
made,more carefully than in the
past.,If students persist in vio- lating our regulations as they have done so in the pa.-t.
they,"will face severe disciplinary measures and pos- sible indefinite suspension."" President Hildreth declared."

and,jj^ave a tine
presentation,"of ""'I'he"
Government,
"Inspector""",
on,
the,
stage,
of,
the,
Lcwisburg,
High,School.
The,
appearance,of the
Howard,
Players,
was,
sponsored,
by,
the,local
chapter,of
the,
National,
Association,for the
Advance-,ment of
Colored,
People.,
They,
were,
given,a
warm,
reception,
by,the
student,
"body,",particularly
by,the so-called
"""discriminatory""",fraternities of
Bucknell.,Fraternities
have,
been,suljject to a
good,deal (>>f attack in the last
tew,
years.,
They,
have,
been,
charged,
with,
discriminating,
against,
feHow,
students,"on the basis of color, religion,"
and,race.
But,
yet,it is
these,fraternities that
cimsistentiy,act as
hosts,to
members,of
various,
minority,
groups,
when,
they,visit the school.
An,after-hours party at one of the
bigger,
houses,
found,
white,
and,
colored,
students,
associating,
together.,
Some,
day,
"""mixed""",parties
may,be
accepted,
by,the
majority,of
Americans.,
As,
things,
stand,
now.,
"however,",it is the
"""discriminatory""",fraternities that are leading the
way.,
The,term
discrimination,can be
found,in leading dictionaries.
The,
""".American",
College,
"Dictionary""",defines it as
--,the
making,"of a difference in i)articular cases, as in favor or"
against,a
person,or
thing.,
Webster,says
discrimination,is
"""observing",or
marking,"a <liriference . . "" . If those definitions are accurate, then no fraternities at"
Buck-,nell actively
discriminate,as to
whom,
they,will associate
with,or entertain in their
homes.,
That,is certainly
more,
than,
you,can
say,for the
majority,of
American,families.
When,it
comes,
to,
picking,
fraternity,
"brothers,",
"however,",
many,of the
campus,fraternities
do,
discriminate.,
They,
have,"a device called the i)lackball, in"
common,
with,
many,otiier natif>>nal
organizations.,
The,l)Iackl)all is
used,to
decide,
who,is to enter the group.
Whether,or not there is a clause in a fraternity stating re- quirements for
"membership,",that blackball is still
there.,It's use
cannot,be justified
morally.,
But,it
does,give
men,the
power,to
choose,people to live with.
.Many,of u>.

We,
cannot,"justify that either, but"

going,to
remove,that

people,into our
homes,
and,getting {<>
know,iheni better
may,help us realize the irration- ality of our prejudice.
Fraternities,
were,
formed,
by,
men,
who,
wanted,to live to- gether in a close
bond.,
Everyone,doesn't
want,to
belong,to such a
group.,
But,
why,
should,
people,try to tell the
group,
how,
they,are to pick
members?,

education.,
Being,liberal in attitude is fine.
But,
being,liberal with
some-,one else's right to pick close friends is not
consistent,
with,the
American,ideal of individuality.

I,think
I,
have,finally discovered
what,is
meant,"by ""the Hucknell"
way,"of life."" It can be"
summed,up in one word:
Conformity.,"To be a ""true"" Bucknellian, one must"
conform,to the pattern of life on
campus.,
Any,devi- ation from this pattern is
frowned,
upon.,Hucknell's Beatitudes might go
something,like this; Blessed are tho.'je
who,don't study
any,
more,
than,"nece.ssary, for they shall be happy go-lucky. Blessed are those who don't bother to think, for it is easier to"
mem-,orize. Blessed are tho.^e
who,won't asso- ciate with
anyone,"""queer"" or ""radical"","
for,
they,
shall,"have their cliques. Blessed are those who have no con- victions, for they shall be easily swayed. Bles.-ied are tho.se who are not con- cerned about"
campus,
and,"world issues, for they shall be ""happily"" complacent. Blessed are those"
who,"are ""practi- cal"" and realize the necessity for"
compromising,"their ideals, for they shall"
know,the
meaning,"of ""expediency"". Blessed are those who"
conform,"for popularity's sake, for they shall be in the majority. Rejoice"
and,"be exceeding glad, for you shall be ""well adjusted"" at Bucknell. Yes,"

But,there
are,
a,few people on

different.,
There,are
a,few- people who won't let the world around

December,"6, 1950 To the Editor:"
Some,time
ago,
I,wrote a letter to
your,
department,
renouncing,"Presi- dent Hildreth's negativi.stic attitude towards .scholastic scholarships as be- ing shallow and contrary to the more progressive t>ducational ideas. Since that letter was never publish- ed, I must conclude that your office is either"
outstanding,in its clerical in- competency or
you,
have,"n<jt the ""guts"" to print a letter opposing the University's policies."
Although,"the issue is not a new one, being presented in Mr. Hildreth's in- augural address, it's controversial character gives it"
enough,significance to
be,included in the letters to the editors department.
I,find it superfluous to rehash the reasons for
my,"opposition to this im- portant administrative policy, but"
having,
observed,that the relatively
unimportant,"athletic scholarships are readily dispensed,"
my,"indignation re- sulting from the lack of scholastic scholarships is increased,"

Herd,garnered just enough points to keep them in the lead. The cagers of
Tony,Packer outscored the
Orange,and Blue but the first period saved the Bison at halftime.

shown,in the
second,"quarter,"

the,

Briefly,by Clyde
McAvoy,
The,"Bison's traveling Swish Kids reached for their third victory up at Iihaca last night and had their collective knuckles soundly rapped by Cornell's star-studded quintet, 63-47. It was the second time in as"
many*',weeks that the Bisons had had their fabulous fast break tangled up in Ivy
League,competition. Princeton was the other loss.
The,only bright spot in an other- wise drab bull
game,for 'the boys from
Lewisburg,
was,"the outstanding hoop"" shooting of"
Joe,Gallagher
who,stole the evenftig's
scoring,
honors,"right from under the no.se of Walter Ash- baugh, Cornell co-captain. Gallagher had"
"I'J,",
Ashbaugh,"18. Strassner, his right knee tightly taped, was second for the Herd with 9 points. DeLoca handled more than his share of rebounds and McKibbin's floor play in the second half was especially note- worthy. Trailing 31-21 at the intermission, the"
Guymen,
came,back determined to halt the
rampaging,
Red,and play a slower
brand,"of basketball. In this, they were successful to a certain ex- tent for. on alternating drives by Mc- Kibbin"
and,"Gallagher,"
the,
Orange,"crept to within s point> of the Itha- cans, a close"
margin,in that type of game.
But,then Cornell's
Ashbaugh,was fouled
by,
McKibbin,"while screenin,i for (Jallagher and the long one step- ped to the line to sink the first of"
many,
many,successive tallys for the .^*arlei t
With,
the,

Chadwick,alternating with

pushed,the lights up to 39-29 before Reich

McKibbin,to call a time
out.,"There was no plugging the dike now, though,"
"and,",
with,
Paul,
Gerwin,
guarding,
Reichman,"especially close, the"
Homers,flooded the basket with shots and were hitting right up to the last 15 seconds
when,
Jim,"Bovard,"
who,was fouled at this point by Jackie
"Webber,",netted the last point of the ball
game.,
The,final: <<>3-47. The
Guymen,will face
Rhode,Island State here in a key contest this Sat- urday spotlighted by the highly-tout- ed defensive play of the Bhoddies's Captain
Johnny,.Mitchell.

Tales,by Joan .Morris -More Organi/.ation Needed Ironically
enough,
the,"girls havp -liown more enthusiasm for volleyball this year than any other sport so far, and yet interclass practices were for the most part disorganized. So"
many,Kirl.v were out in afternoon practices that frequently five or six
were,in each side of the net that very little practice was obtained by any individ ual.
Some,faculty
member,(like we had <<t
hockey,practices) or
some,leader was definitely needed
who,would have allowed for the extra people by di- viding them all
into,
several,teams
whereby,everyone would have had at east
some,valuable
practice.,Let's h(;pe the spirit
and,
enthusiasm,"foi ""lleyball will not be"
diminished,by this lack of foresight. Intergroup Volleyball Intergroup volleyball practices will begin
"Wednesday,",
January,3 and will
end,

TO ATTEND BARNARD,
COLLEGE CONFERENCE,"From left to right, above, are Clyde McAvoy, editor; Mary Jane Riley managing editor; Bill Bellamy, news editor; Harry Staley, sports editor. Photo by Jodrey Since McAvoy's appointment becomes effective immediately, he has announced three new staff changes: Harry Staley, '52, sports editor; Mary Jane Riley, '51, as managing editor; and Bill Bel lamy, '53, news editor. The new staff will be in charge of next week's issue and the second se mester issues. Bill Henkleman, busi ness manager of the paper for the school year, will report changes in his staff next week. Murdaugh Enlists Don Murdaugh, cunrent managing editor, left today for the Armed Forces. He had held important posi tions on the paper for the last two years, and would have been in line for one of the top posts this coming se mester. The new editor has been a member of the staff since he transferred to Bucknell September, 1949. McAvoy's work as past sports editor leaves no doubt about his abilities, for the call bre of his pages has been excellent. Not New At Game McAvoy wrote a column, ""Pop's Bop Shop"" last year along with his duties as assistant news editor. He then moved into the sports staff, becoming top man last Fall. His previous experience includes associate editorship of The Genessee an, editorial and columnist work on The Keystonian, and writing for a marine corps publication at Paris Island in 1944. Due to the increased importance of University sports activities, Harry Staley has consented to again take over the editorship of the sports staff. He held that position last year, after which he moved to news editor. Outside Experience Before entering Bucknell, Staley was a reporter for the Ilion Sentinal for a year, and he has continued t- work for that newspaper during tb summer months. Last summer he became associate editor of the Valley Sportsman, a  weekly sports publica tion covering the Mohawk Valley. On campus, Staley has been activ, on The Bucknellian for three years He wrote sports for the Student Hand book and helped publish a fraternity newspaper. He is currently publicit director of the Men's Glee Club. Mary Jane Riley, the new manag ing editor, is well-versed in journal ism. For the past three summers she has worked on the editorial staff of the Johnstown Tribune. Well-Rounded Associate editor of this paper the past semester, Mary has been a mem ber of the staff for four years. She (See EDITORS, pg. 8) Under new business of the Student Faculty Congress, Pres. Jack Maeby ead a letter from the Political Coun cil of Barnard College inviting four delegates from Bucknell to attend their annual Intercollegiate confer ence. The topic this year is "" A New Era in Southeast Asia"". Dr. Gathings favored the idea of sending four dele gates who lived in the New York-area since tlje conference is scheduled for February 10, two days after the com mencement of the second semester. The delegates would publish their ac tivities in the Bucknellian and also report to Congress. Dr. Gathings moved the President ppoint a committee of three to in- estigate the appointment of such persons, etc. The motion was passed Hugh Campbell brought up the problem of taxi rates between school and the neighboring towns. Some tudents feel they are being over charged. Dr. Smith recommended that the exact fees be determined from the company and inserted in the Buck nellian so that students would have concrete information in case of diffi culty. Mr. Williams moved the secretary1 write to the eorrtpany, sectire the nec essary information, and publish this in the Bucknellian. The motion was passed unanimously. meeting of the board of trustees, Dr, Hildreth said. Parents of freshmen sbphomores, and juniors have been notified of the action in letters that should reach them today. No Service Curtailment "" By careful planning and thrifty housekeeping, we have been able to avoid an increase in charges despite the fact that the costs of operating the college have sky-rocketed in the past few years,"" Dr. Hildreth explain ed. ""But we have now reached the point at which we must decide between raising rates or curtailing services to our students. "" Naturally, for a school of Buck- r.ell's standing, there can be but one choice. Rather than lower our aca demic standards, we have reluctant!;, determined to adjust our charges sc that they will cover at least a portioj of ouirincreased operating expenses,"" he continued. "" Beginning in . September, 1951, therefore, tuition will # be advanced from $500 to $600 per year. Room and board will be increased by ap proximately $50. The over-all charge for resident men students will vary, as before, according to room selection. In the case of resident women stu dents, the new total charge will be $1275 a year. Scholarship Aid The University administrators realize full well that this decision may in some cases work real hardship upon (See TUITION UPPED, pg. 8)"

For five years Temple retained possession of The Old Shoe, but ownership chang ed hands in no uncertain terms at Philadelphia last Nov. 11, when the Thundering Herd stomped to a 35 to C verdict over the Owls. It was one of the greatest victories in Bucknell's football history and a program befitting the receiving of the victor's trophy will precede the pre sentation Monday night. Dr. Edward W.

The play, with Cath erine Klotz and John McFadden in the leads, deals with prosaic but universal things and happenings in a small town. The small town in this case is Grover, N. H., and before the curtain rings down on the final act, a tragic romance of young love is consumated, we meet an inebriated choirmaster, and we take a midnite traipse through a graveyard. The gimmick that imparts such a dynamic effect to the play is the fact that the audience- must use their imagination to visualize the happen ings. Thornton Wilder, as ringmas ter, puts a typical family through the gamut of emotions encountered in any home life, and, although a simple idea, it is tremendously effective, as the spectators build up the story in their own minds. Any more disclosed would spoil the story, so why not come and see how clever you can be? The remainder of the cast includes: Webster Smith--Dr. Gibbs; Edward Davis--Joe Crowell; Robert Burn- baum-- Howie Newsome; Barbara Snyder-- Mrs. Gibbs; Molly Edwards -- Mrs. Webb; Jane Brown--Jane (See OUR TOWN, pg. 8)"

"BU Assigned Two ROTC Units,",
United States Army Announces,"The United States Army announced this week that beginning next September two units (engineering and transportation) of the Reserve O . . cer Training Corps will be assigned to Bucknell. The school is one of 32 of the nation's colleges in which ROTC units will be added, bringing the total to 235 active units in the country. Only one other Pennsylvania college was assigned a unit. An ordnance group will be established at the Uni versity of Scranton. In addition to Bucknell, only one other college was given two units. Expressing gratification at the an nouncement, President Horace A. Hil dreth said: "" If the practice in other colleges that have R. O. T. C. units may be accepted as a criterion, any student who enlists in the unit and does rea sonably good work may be assured an opportunity to continue his college education."" Each unit must have a minimum of 100 men, Dean Malcolm E, Musser explained. They may be expanded, however, to any size deemed desirable by the University. The R. O. T. C. program is a source of officer material for the Army, Dean Musser pointed out. At the end of his first two years of training, a member of the unit will have his choice of continuing in the program or of entering some other branch of service. It is expected that installation of the units will necessitate some revis ion in the curriculum, but no drastic changes are anticipated. The Army does not prescribe the entire curricu lum but requires that, along with his regular course, the student take in his first two years three hours per week of military training and in his junior and senior years five hours per week of such training, Dean Musser ex plained. The University is awaiting further details about the R. O. T. C. program, President Hildreth said. Information will be made available to students as soon as possible, he added."

The Last Round-Up,"Last May, when your editor began his "" tour of duty'', we printed an editorial presenting our views on ""Bucknellian"" policy.

been aired about our editorials.,"A quick review of our editorials may be of some value. * We advocated: support of the blood donor campaign, safe driving, better student-facuity relations, an all-student cheering section at home football games, support of our athletic teams when win ning or losing, the return of frosh hazing, and the continuance of the Hello tradition."

"bined rushing week, commended both fraternities and sororities",
"fbr their scholarship improvement, and reminded both that Buck-",
nell must come first!,"At times we have waxed philosophic: compared our May Day celebration to the communist May Day, wondered from what our ""300 acres set apart"" are set apart, explained that Bucknell is ""owned"" by a combination of students, faculty, ad ministration, trustees, and alumni; exhorted our draft-bound males to make the most of their educational opportunities, ad vised the frosh to join only those activities they have time to actively support, and asked ""liberals"" to let fraternity men de feat non-discrimination their own way, not by removing clauses or blackballs. <<"
Writing editorials has indeed been a privilege.,
You have,

Letter* to the Editor,"December 14, 1950 To The Editor: We, a segment of the student body, wish to formally present our views on the lack of sportsmanship our basket ball team displayed last Saturday night. First, we feel that not all members of the team were responsible for the "" miserable"" showing against Lafay ette. It is, however, a few player!; that can give the whole team a had name, so we direct this to the team as a whole. -- It is, in our opinion, better to lose a game by a wide margin than to hold the scoring down by committing de-. liberate fouls against the opponents. And we mean deliberate fouls! , Granted that aggressive basketball produces many fouls. We like to see an aggressive team, and we realize j that hard playing involves fouling. But we do not like obvious dirty playing at any time. We do not think it funny when our players seem to look for trouble. Our team is good; We knocked off Rhode Island, and we're going to win quite a few games like that. But we don't think we have to win them by out boxing and wrestling our oppon ents. ED NOTE: The above was written by the editor as a condensation of the many letters we received on the sub ject .... It is our belief that many stu dents are of the same feeling. January 4, 1951 To The Editor: This letter has been prompted in directly by a recent editorial (Enough of This Discrimination Talk), in the Bucknellian. First, we of the"
N. A. A. C. P.,"would like to thank individually and collectively those members and non members of fraternities who helped to make the appearance of the Howard Players on our campus a moral and social success. We are pleased to note that the Players felt completely welcome and at home on our campus. However, our second reason for writing is to take exception to what we term fallacies in your reasoning on discrimination in fraternities. It is true that we all actively discrim inate in one way or another, but should we not distinguish between dis crimination used to choose members as individuals in a fraternity, and that type of discrimination whereby whole groups are excluded without ac tive consideration of the individual merits and demerits of persons within such a group? In other words, It is not asked that fraternities disregard the ""American ideal of individuality"" (referred to in your editorial), but rather that this ideal be the only basis for selecting members. * Sincerely yours, Bucknell University Chapter National Association for the Advancement of Colored People To The Editor: Regarding the last Buckneliian's editorial, "" Enough of this Discrimina tion Talk,""  there is a question to be asked. Since one fraternity threw a stag party for the Howard Players, does that indicate that hereafter no problem of discrimination will exist? --that there is nothing more to talk about on this subject?-- that the issue has been settled to the best interests of all ? Concerning t h e discriminatory clauses in fraternity constitutions or merely unwritten "" gentlemen's agree ments,"" the point remains that all members of particular ethenic groups are excluded from membership. Not individuals, but entire races and re ligions are prohibited from belonging. That is collectivism and a prime ex ample of an undemocratic principle. The entire editorial seemed rather Medieval in content, connotation, and tone. Bob Woolhouse January 5, 1951 To The Editor : On behalf of the Bucknell Univers ity Fathers' Association I wish to ex press appreciation for the excellent first page publicity given on December 14 to; the recent release to members of the Association regarding contribu tions to the Alumni Fund. It is hoped that students will pub licize the program as much as possible and I trust that parents of many former students as well as the parents of all present students are subscribers to The Bucknellian and will be remind ed to give to the Fund. The desire is that every parent will give some thing-- we wish to have a higher per centage of participation than the Alumni. Again my thanks for your support. Yours very truly, F. W. Wood, president To The Editor: Last year it was announced that the Bucknellian would maintain a mailing address in the Roberts Hall post of fice. This was to facilitate the re ceipt of items which students wished to bring to the attention of the Buck- nellian staff. Recently, I wanted to have a cer tain classified ad inserted in our "" stu dent voice"" , so I asked the personnel of the local post office to place my communication in the Bucknellian box. I was then told that since the staff never 1jothered to empty this box * it was no longer rese :vved for the paper. I don't like to be termed a ""g rip<<pr"" f but I : ask you, is this a way to do UUS1I1US>> ; Another complaint I wig ih to reigis- ter coiicerns the spelling o f names which are placed in the column en- titled' ' ;ht\y Personal"",, In a re- cent issue of the Bucknellian a cer- tain engagfement announcement ap- peared in which not onlji* the i ontrl's last name but' the last name o f yours truly was incorrectly spelled. This is trivial, I admit, but I also believe that these things are import ant enough, at least to the individuals involved, that a little more care should be taken somewhere in your organi zation to see that things are done cor rectly. Very truly yours, David T. Russell ED. NOTE: The paper no longer has a box on the hill, due to the fact that it was not used. Material for The Bucknellian can be sent by mail to The Bucknellian, Lewisburg, Pa., or placed in the box at the reception desk in Harris Hall. Slightly Personal is tough to proof read, since we must rely on the col umnist's original copy to check spell ing of names. We do our best. Tb The Editor: In the Natural Science Moberly Study Group many topics have come up for discussion. Of these, it seems to me that one of the most important that we discussed in our last meeting is the matter of communication be tween. groups. >> Bucknell, like any other community, is composed of in dividuals with a wide variety of opin ions. The chemist, the engineer, the historian, and the theologian have to learn how to talk with each other since they dwell in different intellect ual worlds and do not have a common intellectual language. All of us have different sets of in stinctive convictions. We must ob tain a better understanding of these instinctive convictions if we are going to be able to understand others. We must not just try to disprove the other fellows ideas but we should try to understand him and learn from him. We should try to discover why they believe like they do. Moberly says: ""There can only be a genuine integration where minds are really in touch with, and really meet, one another."" Being able to have real communication with each other may not necessarily' produce agree ment. But both agreement and dis agreement will necome much more fruitful when they are clarified and found to be real. We at Bucknell certainly have not distinguished our selves in our willingness to discuss many of the issues on our campus. Such issues as (1) student and fac ulty attitudes on cutting; (2) honor system; (3) religion; (4) race rela tions are typical examples. It is not only a question of students and teach ers talking freely with each other but also of faculty members talking free ly to one another. Sincerely, Lester Kieft"
A PRAYER,"Lord God above Be with my love, Be with my loved one tonight; Soft soothe her head And watch o'er her bed Until the light. Thou, one in three With my love be, Be with my loved one this day; Help her, like me, To find strength in Thee Humby I pray. For thou madest man, And made womankind, And thus shall it ever be; Thou madest love For them to find, And made her for me. So Lord God on high, Look down from the sky, Be with her while I'm not there; Guard her for me Till Eternity-- This is my payer. Amen.

Humphreys Says,
Russians Have A,
* Power Complex',"American foreign policy in the years since the close of World War II has been developed in light of the basic assumption that the "" Soviet State as a power complex poses a threat,"" was the keynote idea pre sented by Richard A. Humphreys in his address last Thursday evening at Hunt Hall Living Room. Mr. Humphreys, who received his A. B. at Swarthmore and M. A. at Pnnceton and who is currently serv ing as Assistant Chief of the Histori cal Policy Research Department of the State Department, spoke as a private citizen endeavoring to analyze the conflict between East and West in terms of policy execution. "" Basically,"" he commented, "" Russia is following a three step timetable"" which is her bible of foreign policy. First, she desires ""absorption with war if necessary, preferably without war, of Western Europe. Second, absorption with war if necessary, preferably without war, of the Far East. Third, a direct frontal attack upon the United States and its asso ciates."" Stay Loose In face of this ambitious Soviet program "" we must appraise the prob lem with a minimum of hysteria, sub ordinating our individual, corporate and vested interests.""  Mr. Humphreys expanded this statement by noting that Americans are faced with an ideological challenge-- "" an imperialis tic political doctrine which is designed for domination of the world. The Soviets will make use of the economic weapon as a technique, but it is not the major problem,"" Mr. Humphreys concluded. Continuing along this line of thought, he noted that in terms of potential America is unequaled. "" Our power is potential because we deter mined it to be so.""  It is difficult to blame anyone for demobilization, or Soviet knowledge of this."" The fu ture world picture depends on whether or not we can recover the ground lost in the armaments struggle in a short time. ""We are trying to do it,"" he added, but its achievement "" depends upon the committment of public opin ion to form a framework"" .which can guide America's leaders in the days ahead.

On Sunday of that week, an exhi bition of some fifty etchings and drawings by Harold C. Geyer will be presented in the lobby of Roberts Hall and on Tuesday, January 16th at 8:30, in the Literature Building Auditor ium, Mister Geyer will give an illus trated lecture entitled "" In the Studio of the Unconscious."" In his talk, Mister Geyer examines the evidence for psychoanalysis' latest theory that the source of artistic inspiration must be sought in the wonderful and ter rifying experiences of earliest in fancy. After testing this theory against a wide variety of works rang ing from the classic painters of the past down to the most advanced non objective painters of today, Mister Geyer offers the corroborative evi dence afforded by the undoubted gene sis of some of his own etchings cur rently on display. Artist-Author Mister Geyer is the artist-author of the two illustrated works "" All Men Have Loved Thee"" and "" The Long Way Home"", both subtitled ""A Song Of France"" . Of the former, the late William Lyon Phelps wrote, "" A work of amazing power and beauty."
I,"have not seen anywhere a more dra matic expression of the tragedy of France,"" while Dr. Edmund Bergler, the eminent psychoanalyst, has des cribed "" The Long Way Home"" as, "" The first significant psychological autobiography.""

CHAPEL SPEAKER SAYS,
OLD ADAGE IS WRONG;,
IGNORANCE NOT BLISS,"by Pat Wiley "" Ignorance Is Not Bliss"" was the topic of the first post-Christmas Chapel speaker, Charles Boddie. (Mr. Boddie is the minister of the Mount Olivet Baptist Church of Rochester, N. Y. and a many-time welcomed visi tor to our campus). He based his talk on incidents in the lives of three men: Samson, Moses and Simon Peter. Samson is today thought of as more than a man, he is thought of as a symbol of strength. The tragedy of Samson was his ignor ance--he was a victim of unnoted change. He was not aware that the presence of God had departed from him. Thus he brought about his own downfall by depending on a non-exist ent strength. Mr. Boddie then presented the proposition--are we in America today making this same mistake? Is God on our side ? or rather are we on God's side? Can it be that God has left us and we don't know it? The United States has worked itself into aposi- tion where it must sacrifice some of its pride or lose all of its hide. In a more cheerful vein, he present ed the man Moses. When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments his face was shining and he didn't know it. And so God comes as he goes, without any notice to those he will touch or pass over. He affects those he chooses with an inward glow, not the outward show of tinsel and glitter associated with the publicans. The third man under observation was Simon Peter. A t the time of the transfiguration he was so impressed by the whole event that he said to the Lord, "" Master, it is Good to be here. Let us build three tabernacles, one to Moses, one to Elijah, and one to Thee."" Simon was tragic in that he was a victim of unthinking enthus iasm. He meant to keep the experi ence to himself: he did not realie that happiness is retained by sharing. Mr. Boddie closed with the ques tions: "" What was the ignorance in *their cases ? What is the ignorance in our case? It isn't Bliss!"""
Bucknell Night Attracts,
Many College Couples,"Bucknell Night at Frank Dailey's Meadowbrook, Little Falls, New Jer sey, was celebrated by a large group of Bucknell couples during the Christ mas holidays. On the evening of De cember 28th over 90 Bucknell couples dined and danced to the variety of musk offered by Ralph Flannigan and his orchestra. Colgate, Lafayette, and the University of Pennsylvania were well represented, however, Buck- nellians were in the majority. The large turnout sometimes made dancing difficult, but nobody seemed to mind, and everyone enjoyed him self thoroughly. Nearly every fra ternity on campus was well represent ed.

The purpose was to examine and discuss the subject of United States Foreign Policy; second, to test at the undergraduate level the instructional values and possibilities of a confer ence program; third, to broaden stu dents' contact with their collegiate contemporaries in an academic en deavor."" Endeavoring to carry out the expressed purpose were students from 49 eastern schools stretching from Maine to Virginia. Historical Study In order to achieve the goals, an intensive program of study of the problems and historical background was set up. The schedule included three major addresses, one by Lt. General Gruenther who spoke "" off- the-record"". The second by Dr. Ed ward M. Earle, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N. J., who analyzed briefly the importance of the Far East in relation to the major world prob lems facing the United States. He said that Europe is Democracy's ma jor line of defense and that a strong Europe has and still could control the role of the Far East in the world scene. The final major speaker was Dr. Joseph E. Johnson, President of the Carnegie Endowment of Interna tional Peace. He outlined the role of United States Foreign Policy as it has veered towards defense of Democracy against Russian aggression. Round Tables Interspersed between talks were Five Round Table Discussions in which approximately fifteen students, a chairman and an advisor attempted to analyze the nature of a certain por tion of the Far Eastern problem that faced the United States in light of the social, economic and political history of that geographic area. Because of the tremendous complex ity of the Far Eastern Problem and because of the large number of stu dent participants, it was necessary to break the Far East down into four major areas, (India and Pakistan, China and Formosa, Southeast Asia, and Japan and Korea). Two Round Table groups covered one specific area, giving eight separate discus sions in all. At the close of Round Table Dis cussion IV, the two groups working on the same area met to decide a policy formula which the United States should follow in its Far East ern dealings for the next ten years. This policy formula has been forward ed to the State Department. Final Review A final meeting was arranged so that these various policy formation programs could be read to the entire group at large. Several underlying currents of feeling were in evidence. In the first place, all four policy proc lamations advocated the development of a strong American military force which would give teeth to America's Foreign Policy. Second, that in order for the United States to gain a foothold onCe again in the Far East we must be willing to abandon the hope of indoctrinating the orientals with American morals, culture, etc. Rather, we must appeal to their strong feeling of nationalism and cultural pride. Finally, we as a nation must as soon as possible attempt to recon struct the torn economic ties between the Western Hemisphere and the war torn countries of Asia, so that once again amicable relations may be de veloped."

"Bisons Hear Knocking At Door, Will Travel To New Jersey To Tackle Rutgers Queensmen Saturday Night","by Harvey Sheirr Opportunity will be knocking for the Bisons when they travel to New Brunswick, N. J., to tangle with the Rutgers Queensmen Saturday night. The Herd encounters Rutgers only once this season with a chance to avenge the 88-63 shellacking the Queensmen dealt them last season. Rutgers doesn't look forward to much this season with four starters and seven lettermen gone. Biggest losses are Bucky Hatchett, Don Par sons and Paul Lynner. Hatchett and Parsons were the first Scarlet players ever to surpass the 1,000 point scor ing mark. Lynner was an indispens able play maker. Best holdover is junior Hal Corizzi who leads the Scarlet in scoring this season. Coach Don White thinks Hal can become one of the leading scorers in the East. Hal averaged 20 points per game on the frosh team two year ago and averaged 11 last season in his varsity campaign when he wasn't the main offensive threat. Hal is fast and strong and has a fine variety of close up shots. These types are hard to stop. Six foot, 185 lb. Hal has one dependable mate in Ray Van Cleef, a 5-7 guard. Ray is smooth working and clicks on his set regularly. A good defensive man, too, Ray is a standout baseball pitch- er, with major league promise. Dudley Eppel (6-0), Adolph Schles inger (6-1), and Frank Torpey (6-2) are lettermen. They usually complete the first five. Help comes from 6-7 David Lichtenstein, a senior; James Waring (6-1), a junior; Ben Roesch (6-2), a senior; Les Plosia (6-0), a junior, and Marshall Johnson (6-5), a senior. The Queensmen had ropped six tussles and won two this season be- fore their contest with Army last night and their two victories were over relatively weak opponents. They beat Penn Military College, 91-57, lost to Yale, 70-40, were defeated by Princeton, 57-51, dropped a tussle to Columbia, 73-53, took it on the chin from Maryland, 51-415, lost to Navy, 53-49, were beaten by Fordham, 75-62, and defeated Rutgers of Newark, 65- 56 in overtime. On the basis of this season's per formances thus far, the Bisons should be able to take the measure of the Queensmen if the Herd can display the brand of ball they showed while drubbing Juniata, 87-54, trimming Le high, 59-53, downing Rhodfe Island State, 80-68, and trouncing Albright, 74-58. Prior to last night's contest with Penn State the Bisons dropped en counters to Princeton, 76-64, to* Cor nell, 63-47, and Lafayette, 61-46."
"Rams, Big Red",
Fall But Herd,
Beat By Cats,"by Jack Gamble The Bison cagers presented their fans with a nice two-game- Christmas present, downing a highly favored Rhode Island State quintet 80-69, and downing Albright into the right hand side of the ledger 74-58. The vaca tion's lay off proved too much as the Guymen returned to the hardwoods last week and dropped somewhat of a free-for-all to Lafayette 61-46. The Rams of Rhode Island State, led by their diminutive playmaker Johnny Mitchell, visited our hallowed halls of hardwood but found it rather difficult to set their offense in motion against the shifting man-for-man de fense of Jack Guy's cagers. There were, however, signs of life in the Rams as they put through some nice set shots and, whenever the opportun ity arose, showed Bison fans what teamwork and playmaking was all about. The fast break of the Herd was the factor that put the ball game away. The Rams constantly had to slow the play down whenever they had control. With the slow offense and center Fred Congleton hitting for 14 points in the first half, it looked as though the visitors might have solved the prob lem with the Herd's defense when they jumped ahead at halftime 46-42. The Herd came to life in the second half outscoring the Rams 38-23. It was at this point in the game when Bucky Strassner hit for 18 points and led the Bison surge to victory. The game was not won as easily as the score might indicate. The Herd had to put up a fight and that is just what some of the Orange and Blue crew did. When it was all over the scoreboard fairly gleamed with the proud score Bucknell 80, Rhode Island State 69. Strassner led the evenings entertainment with 29 points while Congleton garnered 26 for the visitors. Albright Allright ""Albright has a veteran squad of good height and should be the tough est opponent for most of the eastern teams.""--so saith Mr, Stanley Wood ward! The Big Red came to Davis and wha hoppen? They don't like to admit it but the Orange and Blue wrappings went on and the ball game was delivered to the Herd's fans in the form of a very pleasing Christmas present. The Red's all senior lineup combined with a lot of height was not enough to stop a much determined Bison five. This was the allest five that the Herd had met to date but even the shortest Bison was able to get on the back- boards and control the rebounds. The Albright five placed three men in the double scoring column but the Herd went one better to place four. The momentum and enthusiasm of the players was especially in evidence as the Red ran a total of 24 fouls among the first five players, one short of a complete team exit via the foul lanes. Bison fans saw for the first time on the home court what a fast break can do to even the tallest of teams when all the parts are tight and in proper working order. The Bisons threw in a typical Orange and Blue finish for (Continued on page 5.)"
"Maack's Matmen Deck Delaware On Home Mats, 27-10",
Davis Gym Fans Jeer At Penn State's Ball Freezing,
Penn State Stalling,
Tactics Unappreciated,
By Courtmen And Fans,"by Clyde McAvoy All dressed up and no where to go was the situation the Bison Courtmen found themselves in last night when Penn State's Nittany Lions, who had left their own lair for the Davis Gym floor for the first time since 1948, stole the sphere at tap-off and stashed it in a deep freeze for most of the ball game. Final score: Penn State 25, Bucknell 15. Coach Elmer Gross said he used the beanbag-like tactics to ""stall Buck- nell's fast break"" and said State might even continue to play that type of game since he was very pleased with the results last night. The enraged Jack Guy had some thing else to say. ""That performance was a disgrace to basketball,"" he said. ""It was a matter of winning a game at any cost."" Fans Jeer Some of the 1800 fans who jeered, cheered, and hooted throughout most of the game, had more positive sug gestions to make. They ranged from turning the water off in the Penn State showers to out and out lynching. But the bad taste left by the game notwithstanding, the books will still record a 25-15 win for Penn State and they did it something like this: State's Piorkowski, in the role of Number 1 villian most of the game, did a Lion's share of the stalling. Six minutes of the first half went by before the Herd finally got their hands on the ball. A brief exchange of shots (none of which scored) ended up with State in possession and stall- inp again. Strella Hits First It remained for Rapid Bill Strella to purloin the ball after 16 full min utes of scoreless play and dribble the length of the court to rack up the first two points of the ball game. The- undaunted Nittany Lions resumed their tactics even with a two-poiht deficit, however, until their Ted Pam- oplos was fouled by Jackie Webber, thereby necessitating them shooting, two fouls. They made them.both. A few moments later, Big Connie DeLoca stepped to the free throw line and made it 3-2, a substantial lead in this kind of ballgame. By the- time the half had ended, however, State had thrown in one field goal from the outside and hit on another foul shot. At the big intermission it was an unbelievable 5-3, favor of the visitors. Gallagher High The beginning of the second half j saw the Nittanymen, alternately freezing and driving in to tally on layups. Field goals by Gallagher, who was high man for our side (7 points), and foul shots by Webber and Strassner kept the contest fairly even and the Guymen even managed a slight edge most of the time. But Strassner's foul or Piorkowski ended this for good midway through the third frame, for the big boy step- BRRRRRRR! Arch-villian Ned Piorkowski of Penn State goes into his deep freeze act while the Bisons' Gallagher and Strassner look disgustingly on. The visitors (hawed out enough in the second half to cop a 25-15 win. Time Exposure by Alan Jodrey"

The end of the half and the ball game saw the Lions parley their in furiating strategy into the final 25-15 victory and a discouraged Herd went to the showers, its thirst for victory after the Lafayette affair, still un quenched. Panoplos and Moore of State split high scoring honors (?) for the eve ning, each with 8 points. Gallagher was high for this side with 7 points. Low Game! Bucknell"

FOR STALEY,"Harry Staley new editor of these pages, has devised and patented a new type of football contest for sale to a paper or syndicate. (Continued from page 1.) in the proceedings. The program will feature selections by the Men's Glee Club and the Uni versity Band. Patricia Wagner, class of '50, will be featured: so-Ioist and Anne Cassel will present a twirling exhibition. Miss Wagner, a contral to, has appeared on television. Long Rivalry One of the oldest uninterrupted col legiate football rivalries in the East, the Bucknell-Temple series is distinc tive in the number of tie games that have resulted since the first meeting in 1927. Seven encounters have end ed in deadlock and four other duels were decided by margins of one point. Seeking a way to honor football servicemen of both universities, the Dental Alumni Association of Temple in 1945 presented the trophy to offi cials of the respective colleges. The shoe was selected at random from a pile of football shoes- worn by former Bucknell and Temple gridders. It is bronze-cast and! mounted on a walnut base with individual plaques showing the scores of each contest. The trophy will be on public display Tuesday in R obertB all. At the conclusion of the program, movies of the 1950 Bucknell-Temple game will be shown- in Davis Gym."

Maack's Grunt'n' Groaners,
Ruffle Hen's Feathers,
Winning Their Initial Bout,"by Bill Fulmer Opening their season on the credit side of the ledger, the Bison Matmen notched an impressive victory over the Delaware Groaners Saturday night, 27-10, before a standing room; crowd in Davis Gym. Minus' two star performers, Bart Capellini through a broken nose, and Wendel Stainsby via a broken, wrist, Coach Herb Maack's undaunted! mat- men posted five pins and a draw, as against only two losses, to tally their 27 points. Goulding Scores In the 127 lb class, Marshall Gould ing scored Bucknell's first five points by pinning Delaware's Robert Hamby in the first period. Goulding, work ing in an efficient and business-like fashion from the outset, scored the takedown, and soon afterwards pinned his man with a bar-arm and body press in 1 minute and 45 seconds. Bucknell 5, Delaware 0. Moving into the 130 lb. class, Bock- nell's Ed Mighell fought his way to a draw with Donald Rumer of Delaware. Apparently outgunned from the be ginning, Ed refused to quit, and came from behind, with barely a minute of match time remaining to score a re verse and two points, making the count 11-10. But the score became 11-11 and the match a draw when the referee awarded one point to Rumer for time advantage. Bucknell 7, Del aware 2. Cunningham Pins At 137 lbs., Ray Cunningham pin ned Delaware's Paul Catts in the first period. Cunningham, a good strong boy, did not look like any replacement as he adequately filled Capellini's shoes to make the score Bucknell 12, Delaware 2. The Maackmen suffered their first setback in the 147 lb. class. Dela ware's Matthew, Mitten pulled a re verse in the second period to decision Degroot 2-0 over the three period route. Bucknell 12, Dei&ware 5. In the 157 lb. class, ""Robby"" Rob inson took the measure- (r)PS Delaware's Ronald Hoidal with a pin in the second period. Robby waited until there were but 7 secondb- remaining before he caught his man wit* a half-nelson and crotch body-press for five points i in the second. Bucknell 17, Delaware 5. Nelson Wooltoefc wasted little time"
Statistics Show,
Bisons Way Out,
Front In Nation,"Official statistics of the National Collegiate Athletic Bureau released recently show that the Bisons are:-not only in the win column this year, but still raising eyebrows statistically.. These figures show that of the 153 major college basketball teams in the nation, only Bucknell is represented by two men among the leading scor ers. Joe Gallagher ranks 13th na tionally with an average of 20.5 points per game, and Don Strassner, who is- listed 35th, placed with an 16.5 aver age. Gallagher was also ranked with the nation's leaders in number of free throws made per game. Jumpin' Joe netted 12 out of 14 attempts in the Albright tilt. The high scoring duo's next trial will be against mighty Rutgers this Saturday night."

Of course the game would have to be moved to a field, but that's no problem. Secondly, ,n addition to the regular uniform, shin pads and cleated boots should be added (for kicking don't you see). Naturally this would require teams. Say ten or eleven men. In case these changes don't provide the desired conditions for bodily con tact, fully padded uniforms could be provided and the shape of the* ball altered somewhat. Perhaps an elongated ball would be interesting. Now, of course, i - the ball could be picked up and run with and/or kicked over upright poles at i either end of the field.

"TROUNCE STATE, 51-31,",
F0R| FOURTH STRAIGHT,"by Jack Gamble Bison hardwood fans saw at least one ball game worthy of their best cheers last night, as the freshman charges of Coach Bill Lane ran their undefeated string to four games. The Prelim attraction showed the Junior Herd to be the better team as they downed State's junior five 51-31. The superior ball-handling of the Orange and Blue Frosh was credited largely to A1 Holton, who proved to be the playmaker of the evening. The fine team work shown by the entire Bison squad combined with the sharp eye of center Jim Poff, proved to be too much for the Stater's shifting man-for-man defense. Early Lead The Herd gained an early lead which they were forced to relinquish by the- period marker. It was not long before the home five caught fire again and began to crawl back to the leading side of the ledger. When halftime rolled around, the Bisons left the floor with a four point advantage, 24-20. Jim Poff had a great big smile to give for the 13 points he had gar nered at mid-game. The biggest scoring surge of the game came in the third period when the Herd returned to the hardwoods to push through 15 points while hold ing the State College five to four. The Frosh had gained a 31-22 advant age before the visitors decided to call time and count noses to make sure they had five men on their defense. 11 Having accounted for their poor | showing on the defense, the Staters I once again joined the ball game only | to find that the rest period had not | Cooled the shooting accuracy of the I Lanemen.

By continuing to score heavily in every event, the defending champs are again on top and figure to be in the running all the way. However, with not quite half the race completed, most of the groups have been able to hang close and feel they cannot be counted out of the com petition. The fact that each of the first five teams have won an event illustrates the spread of talent. Kappa Sigma won wrestling; Delta Upsilon, Cross Country; Sigma Chi, soccer; Sigma Alpha Epsilon, handball; and Phi Kappa Psi, tennis. Following the cup winners are Kap pa Delta Rho who have placed second a little luck could shake that ""runner-up jinx""; Tau Kappa Epsilon who continues to place high; and Lambda Chi Alpha who always has a reputation for being tough. BISA has also entered the competi tion and promises to field teams in the various coming events.

Leopards No Laff Our good friend Bob (Headlock) Fendell, columnist for Sports Extra, tells us that basketball and wrestling doubleheaders are fast becoming a tradition among the mid-western schools. Bison fans found Saturday night that the burping behemoths could provide more real athletic com petition than could the Herd's cagers. Unlike Coach Herb Maack, who got some good laughs out of his squad's wrestling antics, Jack Guy could find nothing to give even a faint chuckle about. The Herd just couldn't seem to get a rolling start at any time during the evening. Even the usual second half splurge, which has become a trade mark of the Guymen, was not in evi dence as the Maroon and White of Lafayette rolled easily over the Bison quintet, 61-46. The court work of Pete Carril, plus the shooting eye of George Davidson, and all around heads-up ball handling by their teammates gave the visiting basketeers a fairly easy night of it."

Davenport won the laurels in the 165 lb. class; DeGroot and Hardy were runners-up in the 155 lb. and 145 lb. class respectively; while Schultz and Voorhees reached the semi-finals in the Heavyweight and 125 lb. classes respectively.

Engine-Ears,"by Frank Kelly Jointly sponsored by the Physics Society and the four engineering so cieties, the film ""Atomic Physics"" will be presented next Wednesday. The movie dramatizes the story cf the atom from Dalton's atomic theory up to 1948. Its production was guided by such eminent men as Sir John Cockcroft, Professor Einstein and Professor Frisch, who also appear in it. Following an explanation of uran ium fission and the reasons why an atomic bomb was possible, the end of the film, nevertheless, gives a hopeful glance at the future. At the last business meeting of the Engineering Council, on December 14, the final decisions for the above-men tioned film were discussed and put into action. Three tentative dates for the showing were set; the final arrangements being dependent on the availability of the film and the best opening on the University calendar. The Council's next meeting is sched uled for January 18, at 4:30, in E 103. Professor K. B. Jackson of the Uni versity of Toronto spoke before the ASCE on Monday, January 8. His subject was ""Your Other Eye is More than a Spare"" which dealt with stereo scopy. A business meeting was held before the talk, at which the Society's officers for the calendar year were elected. The officers elected were: Jack Peters, president; John Storch, vice- president; John Walker, treasurer, and William Hendrixson, secretary. At noon, on Friday, January 12, Tau Beta Pi, national engineering honor society, will present a plaque to President Hildreth, in the lobby of the Engineering Building. The plaque displays the society's bent and has a list of all Bucknell engineers who have become members since the in stallation of the society at Bucknell. The ceremony for the presentation is open to the public, and a cordial in vitation is extended to all who wish to attend."

Village Voice,
Villagers Celebrate Christinas,
"With Party, Welcome New Arrival","by Bill Wakefield Santa Claus came with presents for all the children, humorous movies were shown, Christmas carols were sung, refreshments were enjoyed--1 everybody had a good time! Yes, the Village's Christmas party was a big success. And much of the credit goes to the American Legion for allowing us the use of their social room, and for donating a big part of the refresh ments. Villagers who rapidly turned a good idea into a happy reality were: Planning Committee: Jeanne Web ster, Mary Holmes, Doris Ivey, Art Featherstone, and Emil Polak, Chair man. Serving and Entertainment Com mittee: Gloria Good, Kay Bradley, Friedel Sharadin, Dorothy Zaukaus- kas, Martha Dyne and Agnes Clothier. John Metzger and Ralph Webster did a good job of arranging for and running off the movies. Fearing it might reach the kids, we won't men tion the part played by Harry Easton. 'Nuff said to comment he'll make a ""fine one"" for his children in a few years. We warned our readers that once the Village got started, there'd be nn end to ""it."" This time it's Jo and Henny Ardler. On Tuesday the 26th, I saw Henny leave the Village with Jo in his '37 DeSoto. The following Monday I saw him drive back with Jo and 6-lb. Deborah Jean, and a big grin. Jo's happy, Henny's proud, and everyone congratulates them on their first. Family of the Week: Did your marriage start with a bang? Bob and Muriel Benjamin's did when, the day following the wed ding they demolished their car com pletely. Their honeymoon plans might have been shaken, but the accident certainly hasn't hurt their marriage: This couple's marriage is as solid as they come. It all started when Bob and Muriel were high school sweethearts at Athens, Pa. After graduation, Bob went to Lehigh for one semester in '41, then became an apprentice tool- maker for one year. Shortly after their marriage in April, 1942, Bob entered the Army. Then came the war-time experiences of a ""vagabond marriage"" which took them all over the South and caused them to buy and sell several housefulls of furniture. Muriel was with Bob all the way, ex cept for his overseas time. While in Texas a baby was born, and we know her today as pretty, blond Joyce Benjamin. She's in 2nd grade now, and is mighty proud that she's a real, honest-to-goodness Tex- an! Joyce likes the Village and her school, but she can't understand some of the peculiar things her daddy's school does. For example, why doesn't her daddy take spelling, reading, music, and, best of all have recess? And she just can't imagine why Bob should have more than one teacher. We know all these puzzling questions will clear themselves up when Joyce returns to Bucknell about 1962. Before coming to Bucknell in Feb ruary of '48, Bob completed work un der a special GI program at Elmira College. He lived in East College and the Temporary Dorm before he brought his family to the Village in June of '49. Muriel and he both work part-time at the bookstore, while most of his time is given to mechanical engineer ing and most of hers to making a pleasant home. They both handle their present roles excellently."

The Campus is about your best bet for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The picture is ""Let's Dance"" starring Betty Hutton and Fred Astaire. It's the usual dance team picture but with an added dash of Astaire. Comment: Hutton bubbles while As taire burns. At the Capitol Theater in Milton on Thursday is the sequel to ""Mrs. Mini ver,"" ""The Miniver Story."" It stars Greer Garson, Walter Pidgepn, and John Hodiak; and if that sounds good, you're in for a blow. The picture drips the most disgusting mush imag inable. Mr. Miniver leaves Mrs. Min iver to go to war, and in the meantime some American soldier falls in love with her, her daughter is in love with a man old enough to be her great grandfather, and on top of all that misery, Mrs.. Miniver finds out she does not have very long to live. Comment: Spare us from a fate like this. Friday and Saturday at Milton is ""Dallas"", a Technicolor Western star ring long lean Gary Cooper. Comment: Another glorified cops and robbers picture. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at Sunbury (the Strand) is a picture your reviewer, shameful to confess, doesn't know a thing about. It is ""American Gorilla in the Phillipines"" and stars Tyrone Power. Comment: See it; what can you lose? j * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ^ ^"

Foreign Policy...,"(Continued from page 3.) Four Policies This framework of opinion must fuse itself with the* four fundamental policies of the present government if they are to give strength and coher ence to America's actions. All four policies are based on the assumption that ""disruption of any kind is of im mediate interest to the United States."" Mr. Humphreys then briefly listed the policies in the following manner: ""first, universality of action within and without the United Nations and in so doing oppose military aggres sion with military measures; second, lend political support to the free peoples wherever they may be in their strivings for the promotion of human rights; third, give economic support to the free peoples through out the world; fourth, make military committments within and without the U. N."" In conclusion, Mr. Humphreys pointed out that there is no guarantee that these basic policies are right or that they solve the probilems at hand, but ""they are sufficiently flexible for' a foreign policy which as a whole is"

In accordance with e E University policy, the name of the | student is being withheld. | The University Motor Vehicle i Regulation is as follows: ""Begin- i ning in September, 1949, no mem- I ber of the Freshman, Sophomore, E or Junior Classes will be permitted E to have a motor vehicle at Bucknell | except by special permission of the | Car Permit Committee."

Rosenberg, Assistant Secre tary of Defense in charge of man power personnel problems, presented their statements. The program can be considered along these major sections: The Overall Plan All men would be subjected to draft at the age of 18, although General Marshall and Mrs. Rosenberg said that at first the draft would affect only those who are 18 years and four or five months. Everyone would re ceive four months of basic military training. An increased reliance on 18-year-olds, the plan notes, would re duce draft calls for upperclassmen now in college. The Goevrnment program calls for the ""uninterrupted flow of scientists, technicians and professional men."" It says specifically that the need of in dustry and agriculture for engineers and technicians would be met by our ""ability to maintain a larger number of occupational deferments in 19-26 year groups."" Furthermore, the Pres ident would not be required to induct men for completion of active service imfenediately after graduation from college.

Greeks To Participate In Post-Exam,
Jubliee Slated By IFC For Feb. 23rd,"The Interfraternity Council completed preparations for the Post-Exam Jubilee at a special meeting last Sunday in the Sigma Chi house. Don Man- ning, chairman of the event, announced that each fraternity will be asked to participate in the festivities, to be held Friday evening, February 23. Cup Awarded Each house will be asked to pre pare a ten to twelve minute skit for presentation. A cup or equivalent prize will be awarded to the house presenting the best skit in the estima tion of the judges. Each house was requested to decide upon their skit as soon as possible so that themes could be announced. President Bud Bush clarified the new ruling issued by the school con cerning the activation of pledges. It was announced that any pledge may be activated the night after semester marks are published provided the man has attained a total of 25 quality credits. The old ruling did not allow activation until at least midway in the second semester in addition to the requirement of 25 q. c.'s.

Inability to secure a banquet hall at a convenient time forced the council to drop the plans for a pledge banquet at this time. However, plans are under way to incorporate this idea in second semester plans of I. F. C. substantial contribution outside the military service. Increase Of R. O. T. C. Unitb Under the Marshall-Rosenberg pro posal, the R. O. T. C. program of col lege training of young officers would be expanded. Students selected for this program would have to serve an initial four- month period of basic military train ing under a universal program. The balance of service would be fulfilled after graduation. Deferment Of 75,000 Men In the first three years of the mili tary program the President would have the authority to defer 75,000 students annually so that they could complete their college training ""and keep the educational pipeline from drying up. These students would have to take a four-month period of military training on the same basis as alT others. Three-Year Interval The deferment of the 75,009 stu dents would hold only for the first three years. The three-year limit is based on the belief the colleges would be back on a stable footing after the first class of Universal Military Ser vice and.

Plaque Presented To University,
By Engineering Honorary Friday,"by William G. Hendrixson On Friday, January 12, 1951, in brief ceremonies held in the lobby of the Engineering Building, Tau Beta Pi, national engineering honor society, pre sented Bucknell University with a plaque containing the names of all members who have been initiated into the society at Bucknell. Professor George Irland, Chairman 0* ... ............... of the Engineering Department gave the opening remarks. Professor Ir land remarked upon the purposes of Tau Beta Pi and pointed out that membership is granted for work well done and is not considered a means by which members can lord them selves over others who have been un able, to gain admittance. Donald Betty, president of the Bucknell chapter, pointed out that Pennsylvania Eta Chapter was insti tuted at Bucknell in the fall of 1947 through the efforts of Professors W. J. Garman and D. M. Griffith and the local engineering honorary, Beta Ep silon Sigma. He described the work as one of several projects the society is undertaking. Mr. Betty noted that members were selected for the society from those engineering students who are in the upper fifth of the senior class or the upper eighty of the junior class. At the conclusion of his re marks, President Betty unveiled the plaque and presented it to Dean Wil liam H. Coleman as a symbol of the chapter's activities. In accepting the plaque on behalf of the university, Dean Coleman re marked upon the progress made in the engineering departments at Buck nell in spite of the relative newness of the departments. He pointed out, also, that Tau Beta Pi was one of the means bywhich engilneers would keep from resting on the' laurels of the past and be provided with the broader learning that will be needed pin the future. The plaque contains the names of the 135 members initiated at Bucknell since 1947 and the faculty members who are members of the society. It will be on permanent display in the lobby of the Engineering Building. It is planned that each new pledge class will add their names to the roll. The actual designing and construction of the plaque was done by Franklin Frederick and Thomas Clarke of Pennsylvania Eta."

Enlist Or Be Drafted?,
With the war in Korea and the inclinations of different draft,
boards supplanting dating and intramurals as the usual topics of,
"conversation around campus, it is apparent that we at Bucknell",
can no longer pay only passing attention to the world situation.,
A New York newspaper a few years ago dealt with a similar,
"situation by telling the story of St. Francis of Assisi, who was",
hoeing in his garden one day when a friend approached and asked,
what he would clo if he were to suddenly learn that he was to die,
at sunset.,
"Scarcely stopping to look up, he answered, ""I would",
"finish hoeing my garden.""",
"What the story points out, of course, is that things must be",
kept in their proper perspective. But the increasing number of,
empty seats in the classrooms indicates that we at Bucknell are,
doing anything but that. Supposedly level headed students are,
"panicing in the face of social change, turning their backs on a col",
"lege education, and racing in cars to Williamsport and the rela",
"tive security of a Navy, Army, or Air Force enlistment. Whether",
this is an overt act of spontaneous patriotism or a desire to avoid,
"being drafted into the infantry remains a moot question, the point",
being that we're sure this is just what a Joe named Stalin would,
want.,
"So what would Uncle Sam want, you ask. He's a little slow",
"about things like this, but when he gets squared away he usually",
"comes up with something like: ""Stay in school.' Men with edu",
"cation will be needed, and if I want you in the meantime I'll let",
"you know.""",
Just last week legislation to extend the Holloway,
plan ( a program of continued college education for men expect,
ing to be called into the service whereby they would be trained,
for one of the three branches) was put before Congress by Sena,
tor Richard B. Russell of the Armed Services Committee. And,
this on the heels of President Hildreth's announcement of the,
forming of a R. O. T. C. unit on campus next Fall.,
In the meantime there's plenty to be done. There's that book,
"-to be read, that meeting to attend, that exam to be taken.",
We must go on hoeing our garden.,

of finding out some small bit of information. Not only did he fail,
"to find out anything about his test, the blank card was not even",

To The Editor:,
"A wide variety of people, scenes",
and objects cross our paths in tho,
"course of a single day, but how much",
do we actually take in?,
A widely,
used yardstick for measuring alert,
ness and keenness is the power of ob,
servation.,
Having reached the point in,
life,
where we are,
matriculated,
college,
"students, we should possess a well-",
developed power of observation.,
"Prospective employers, whether con",
"sciously or unconsciously,",
will,
be,
judging us by the degree of alertness,
we have attained.,
"Observation is a wonderful teacher,",
portraying a good deal of knowledge,
that cannot be obtained from text,
books alone.,
Many of us are guilty,
of traveling a narrow orbit oblivious,
to the surrounding elements.,
Such a,
limited sphere is degrading to,
the,
personality and does not command re,
spect.,
"Remembering people, news, places,",
"etc., is an art which can be developed",
to some extent in all of us. Someone,
once said that we're all so busy think,
ing of what we will say that we don't,
hear what the other fellow is saying.,
This is precisely the way we often,
pass up gems of wisdom.,
Bearing in mind the fact that keen,
"observation is the sign of an alert,",
"thoughtful person, let's all try to at",
tain a higher standard.,
Test your,
self.,
"Upon arriving home tonight,",
see how many names you can recall,
of persons you spoke to during the,
day.,
A Graduating Senior,
Penn State To Register Full,
Freshman Class In February,
"For the first time since the end of World War II, Pennsylvania State Col",
"lege will admit a freshmen class, including both men and women students, at",
"the beginning of the second semester, which opens on February 4.",
"In announcing the plan, President Milton S. Eisenhower said that ""in these",
"emergency times, when industry and the armed forces need trained men and",
"women, the College is especially anxious that its facilities be used to the full",
"est extent.""",
The decision to admit a freshman class in February will help recent high,
school graduates who want to begin college work before becoming subject to,
call under the Selective Service Act.,
"During the war, the College operated",
"or. an accelerated program, admitting three classes each year.",
Admission of freshmen at mid-semester will not prevent the College from,
granting admission to qualified students desiring to transfer from other col,
leges or to those students who have completed their work at Penn State ex,
"tension centers and are ready to transfer to the campus, explains Dr. C. O.",
"Williams, acting dean of admissions.",
"The ""Harvard Lampoon,"" campus humor magazine, finds itself in a very",
unfunny position. A state police lieutenant was recently assigned to investi,
"gate the ""filthy, obscene and licentious"" magazine which was confiscated by",
"Massachusetts police. A district judge described the magazine as ""not fit"" to",
"be taken into homes where there were mothers, fathers or sisters. The con",
"tent of the magazine, according to its editor, are a collection of cartoons and",
jokes from other college magazines.,
ON OTHER CAMPUSES,
by Babs Fiedler,
"According to the Clarkston Integrator, the mathematics department of the",
University of Akron is going to make it easy for students to get hold of old,
tests.,
The department is setting up a file system in the university library,
which will include the examinations of the previous four semesters.,
The head of the math deparemtn was quoted as saying that he felt this,
was a big step toward the creation of better feeling between faculty and stu,
dent body.,
The only department that does this at Bucknell is the Chemistry Depart,
ment. The World Lit Department and Math Department make a feeble at,
"tempt at posting tests, but this seems to be more the results of a brief spurt",
of ambitipn than any systemized approach. The only test that the majority,
of Bucknellians see before hand is the supposedly secret Cumulative Tests.,
It's a queer world.,
"Easton, Pa.--(I. P.)--Most modern educators recognize the importance",
"of acquainting students with the great ideas that shape our civilization, and",
many colleges have tried to do this without regard to the artificial fences that,
"segregate departments, declares Dr. W. W. Watt, head of the English depart",
ment at Lafayette College.,
"""Ambitious survey courses in 'Great Books',",
"'Western Civilization,' and 'The Humanities' appear in college catalogues",
throughout the country.,
*,
"""But few of them,"" he points out, ""have lived up to their noble aims and",
high-sounding blurbs. Four short-comings are common to such spread-eagle,
courses. They are planned for the run-of-the-mill freshmen and sophomores,
who are not competent to assimilate them intelligently; they are taught by,
jack-of-all trades to groups too large for intelligent discussion; they encourage,
superficial reading and thinking by attmpting to cover too much ground too,
rapidly; and the material is not carefully organized to present a continuous,
"picture.""",
They shouldn't talk about our 190 courses like that.,* * * * *
"Psychology class at Coe College, Iowa is really progressive, according to",
an item in the State College News.,
The story told about a word association,
test being given by one of the psych professors at Coe. The usual black-white,
"examples were given, then the prof came up with ""love."" Ventured a timid",
"student, ""Neck?""",* * * * *
"According to a report, published in the Daily Reveille, the Vanguard,",
"Brooklyn College's paper, has been suspended for the second time in six",
months.,
Last spring the faculty adviser to the paper quit because the paper would,
not follow his recommendations.,
"At the time, the Vanguard was called mon",
opolistic because it was maintained by compulsory student fees.,
The latest suspension resulted from an editorial criticizing the dean for,
"his handling of a student organization called the ""Labor Youth League of",
"Brooklyn College""--a group which was ordered to disband, allegedly because",
its views on the Korean War coincided with those of the Communist party.,
Each day it's becoming more and more obvious that all the communists,
are not in Russia.,* * * *
"Salem, Ore.--(I. P.)--Seeking to formulate a better organized and dis",
"tributed social program at Williamette University this year, the Social Activi",
"ties Board has cut down on the number of social events, placed closer regula",
"tions upon others, and introduced several innovations.",
It is hoped that the,
new working social calendar will allow for a more uniform plan encompassing,
all campus organizations and giving each equal social representation.,
Pledge dances have been entirely eliminated for the present time and fire,
"sides have been scheduled for the same date, with a maximum of five firesides",
per living organization. Fraternities and sororities will be held to one formal,
and one informal dance per year.,
Think of Bucknell on this schedule. The poor brow-beaten Fraternity Joe,
not being able to boast of the,10
dances his house gave last year nor to flaunt,
his fortunes in the face of frats less fortunately endowed.,$ * * * *
"Columbia, Mo.--(I. P.)--All Stephens College students elected or appoint",
ed to positions of leadership of campus organizations are eligible to participate,
in the general meetings and individual conferences offered by the Campus,
"Leadership Course, continued this year as the first of three units in the Col",
lege's Leadership Training Program.,
"Following the pattern which has proven successful in previous years, this",
"Work includes a one-credit course, ""Psychology of Leadership,"" offered to cam",
"pus leaders by Dr. Eugene Shepard, Dean of Student Personnel. ""Community",
"Leadership,"" another one-credit course, will be given during the second semes",
ter. A clear-cut emphasis is thereby placed upon the value of college experi-,
nces as the basis for constructive leadership activities in the student's post,
"college, community life.",

'Our Town' Runs Gauntlet,
Of Forum Critics',
Comments,
by Don Raphael,
"The usual critic's bouquets and brickbats were hurled at the cast of ""Our",
"Town"" Sunday night at the forum in Bucknell Hall.",
Comments ranged in,
"vituperosity from the poor lighting' in the third act to George's 1950 suit,",which was out of place in the 1912's.* ----------------------------------------
PHI KAPPA PSI WINS,
INTRAMURAL CUP IN,
DEBATING CONTEST,"On the bouquet side of the ledger,' the critics liked Emily's Shirley Temple- ish cuteness and one observed that John McFadden will make a fine law yer, with his wonderful manner of projecting himself. The critics were Mr. Kinnard, Miss Merkel, Mrs. A. Johnson and Burt Ginsburg, a graduate student, was the student critic. The majority of the critics enjoyed the first two acts, but felt that the play hit a pitfall in the third act. Perhaps this was due to the poor writing that Wilder did in creating the third act. Some felt that he was wrong in writing the first two acts on simple prosaic things, and then, in Kinnard's words, bring in ""Metaphysics"" in the third act. Mr. Kinnaird also follow ed the majority in lauding Bill Bil- lipp's performance as the stage man ager. Diction Praised Miss Merkel, a native-born German instructor, was impressed by the fine diction of the cast. She also admired the cooperative spirit of the actors, and the smooth teamwork of the cast, the directors, et cetera. The very ""Milkmanish"" Howie Newson, Miss Merkel felt, and the professor seemed to point out that a fine job of casting was accomplished. ""One of the most convincing bit parts . . ."" was Mrs. A. Johnson's opinion of the professor. She felt the cast captured the uncertainty of the wedding scene very aptly, and felt that the make-up was plausible, con trary to many of the critic's ideas. Prof Promising Burt Ginsburg, the student critic felt the play afforded one a ""very en joyable evening."" He commended Willard Smith's performance as one of the dead, and was sure that Mr. Smith showed ""promise"" which seem ingly would be an understatement. In closing the forum, the ""promis ing"" Willard Smith tossed his bouquet to the cast, and commended the qual ity of ""Our Town."" Phi Kappa Psi, it was recently an nounced, has won the Intramural De bating Cup. The topic for this year's eries of debates, in which eight fra ternities and two sororities competed, was ""Resolved that the United States should adopt a policy of Universal Military Training."" Each group debating had a nega tive and an affirmative team. The Phi Psi affirmative team was made up of Alan Goff and. John Harvey, while their negative team included Harry McSorley and Dick Wentley. The cup-holder's first win, in which they held the affirmative, was over Phi Lambda Theta. Their second round, also upholding the affirmative, proved them to be victorious over Sigma Alpha Mu. These two wins put the Phi Psi's into the finals, in which they competed with Delta Up- silon. This gave the negative team a chance to prove its strength. Once again the Phi Psi's were the victors. The Bucknell Debating Society, sponsors of the competition, presented Phi Kappa Psi with the Intramural Debating Cup and a prize of five dol lars each to Harry McSorley and Dick Wentley, champions on the negative team. Charles Swope was the coach of the Phi Psi debators."
"RILW Discussed,",
Theme Announced,"The Central Committee of Religion in Life Week, consisting of the lead ers of various committees on the project, met last night at 7:00 in Hunt Recreation Room. Bud Bush, the chairman of this pro gram outlined to the group what had already been accomplished by the workers on Religion in Life Week and what was planned for the future. The theme of Religion in Life Week, which will be held from February 23 to March 4, will be ""Christian Faitli Confronts the Crisis ir> the Univers ity."" Bush suggested that students participate in the Moberly studies on the book Crisis in the University so that they may more fully join in the discussion during the week. ""Plans are being competed in re gard to the Convocation speakers,"" Bud stated. In regard to the desi- dent discussion leaders, the fraterni ties have already chosen theirs, and the men's and women's dorms are in the process. These speakers are chosen from lists consisting of min isters, youth leaders, teachers from Bucknell, Lewisburg, and other cities. Anyone interested in working in Religion in Life Week can contact either Bud Bush or the CA office. The committee leaders would like to com plete their committees before finals, so don't delay, sign up soon."

Penn State Debate!,"""Resolved that the non-communist nations should form a new interna tional organization."" This was the topic at the non-decision Penn State- Bucknell debate last Thursday evening in the Vaughan Literature Lounge. Bucknell held the negative side, while Penn State took the affirmative. Debating for Bucknell were David Shinn and Bert Murphy. They were opposed by Penn State's Jack Bod- dington and Robert Allardice. Both sides seemed to agree on many of the important points, however, the main disagreement was in the scope of the military agreements. The affirmative stated that the or ganization should contain all non-com munist nations in one unit, while the negative favored regional agreements | including the Atlantic Paet South America, etc. Both sides agreed that the United i Nations is a valuable institution in I conducting non-military matters, but, due to the influence of Russia, mili-1 tary agreements are impossible. The debate was followed by a ques tion and answer period, during which many questions were raised from the audience."

Chiding American education for its neglect of the Far East, Oliver J. Caldwell, representing the Division of Exchange of Persons, urged Buck- nell's faculty to remedy the curricu lum's inattention to the Orient. In an effort to provide an integrated study of Oriental culture, Dr. Charles M. Bond, Dr. Lewis E. Wethington, and Dr. Cyrus H. Karraker from the departments of religion and history plan to combine three separate courses that deal in part with the Far East. The new syllabus is being prepared from the History of World Religions, the History of the Middle and Far East, and World Religions and World Culture. To develop better under standing of the peoples of the Orient and their problems and ideas, stu dents will consider such topics as his torical backgrounds of India and China, the religious and philosophical foundations of the Far Eaist, the his tory of India and China in more mod ern times, British conquests in the East, Christian missions, Hinduism's adjustment to western influence, Buddhist reaction to western culture, the emergence of Japan, and the 20th Century Orient. If the experiment proves successful, an entirely new course may be added to the curriculum next year, and the three participating groups of this spring will go on their several ways. nice Leagus, Secretary will both grad uate in February.

Last Second Set Shot Sends Bison Netmen Down To Fifth Defeat 69-67 At Hand Of Mules,
Strassner And Gallagher Are Stars,
Of Exciting Contest At Allentown,"by Harry Staley A long set shot by Joe Bonacci with only 25 seconds left in the game gave the Muhlenberg Mules their fifth win of the season last night as they edged out the Bison netmen 69-67 in Allen town. Strassner High The battle, which was fought on a nip-and-tuck plane throughout, was highlighted by the fine offensive play of the Bison scoring twins, Don Strassner and Joe Gallagher with 21 and 18 points respectively. The bur den of the scoring for the Mules was carried by Dick Eckert, towering cen ter, who dropped in 18 points for the visitors. The first half was well-played with the visiting Herd holding the edge all the way. The shooting was very sharp in the first twenty minutes with Bucknell's shooting percentage hover ing around 50% for a long time. The Mules found the going tough in the first half but managed to whittle, down a 20-12 lead that the Bisons had built up midway in the first half. The Mules drew to within one point of the visitors and then Jack Guy's charges began to find the range again. Strassner clicked for four field goals and one foul in the first half to trail Gallagher in scoring at that time by one point. Gallagher left the floor at halftime with 10 points on four field goals and two fouls. Bucknell led by six points, 38-32, at halftime. Mules Hit 'The- second half started off with a bang and it was indicative of the way play was to be for the rest of the eve ning. Muhlenberg quickly drew to within two points of the Herd when Dick Eckert dropped in a set to make the score 44-42 Bucknell. Little Joe Bonacci, who played a sparkling floor game for the Mules all evening, then broke loose and tossed in a layup to knot the score. He then dropped in a foul shot and Muhlenberg forged in front for the first time by a count of 45-44. Following an exchange of lay-ups by Strassner and Binaccio, Muhlen berg forged into the lead and held it until big Connie DeLoca tapped in a rebound to tie the score at 54-54. Joe Gallagher then netted two foul shots followed by two more by Bill Strella and the lead by four. Strassner then curled in a lay-up to spread the Bison lead to six points, 60-54. Eckert Tough Elmo Jackson then took things into his own hands and with two one-hand ed push shots the Mules were back in the game. Dick Eckert then hit with a hook shot to tie the score at 61-61. The tall Mule center duplicated the feat a few seconds later and Strass ner netted the count with a lay-up on which he was fouled. Strassner net ted the foul and Bucknell led 64-63. Bucky then scored on another driving lay-up and made a three-pointer out of it when he was hacked. At this point things were looking up for the Bisons as they led 67-63 with approximately one minute left in the game. Bill Strella then eared the Bison attack into a semi-freeze but big Bill Jackson broke through, inter cepted the pass and tossed to Joe Bi naccio who dropped ilia long set shot. Again the Herd lost the ball and the Mules capitalized when Eckert scored on a tantalizing left handed hook shot to tie the game at 67-67. Binaccio Ices It With 35 seconds left in the contest Bill Strella was fouled in the- act of shooting and stepped to the line for two. However, he failed to connect and with the clock showing 25 seconds remaining, troublesome little Joe Bi naccio again hit on a long set shot to make it 69-67, Muhlenberg."
Rutgers Crumbles Before,
Bison Scoring Splurge;,
Strassner Leads Attack,"by Jack Gamble It was fully twenty minutes before Bison cagers thawed from the Penn State freeze and gained a lead they never relinquished to down a fighting Rutgers quintet 74-56 in New Bruns wick last Saturday night. A twenty-three point onslaught in the third period provided the Guymen with the marin they needed to take the measure of once-mihty Rutgers. What was said in the dressing room is not known, but the Bison five came to the floor and stamped a great big Jack Guy trademark on the Queens- men as they outscored them by 18 points. This proved to be the final margin of victory and the ""straw that broke the Scarlet's back."" Now, Where Is The Anti-freeze? The first period featured the Herd's usual slow start and wait-for-the- sure--shot brand of ball. It was the only period in which the Scarlet was able to outscore the Bisons. The scoreboard read Rutgers, 22, Bucknell 16 at the end of the first ten minutes of play. A difference of only six points, and a lead which the Queens- men were barely able to hold until halftime. With the preliminaries and warm up exercises out of the way, the Orange and Blue began their three periods of real heads-up ball handling. It was in this second period that the Herd's inside shots gave them a scor ing tie; each team pushing through 14 points. Defense was the answer to all of Jack Guy's problems as he found his cagers unable to hit the shots from out front but gradually creeping up on the rebound tip-ins. Bucky Strass- ner's fine control of the backboards netted him 22 points as the teams left the floor at halftime with the score reading Rutgers 36, Bucknell 30. Thawian Supreme! ""Quick, Hal, the needle,"" and the needle it must have been, for the Herd returned to the hardwoods with the greatest of smiles on theiy faces. They knew what was coming, but the Scarlet didn't. For the next 15 min utes the Queensmen couldn't buy a basket. Don White had his cagers change their defense to a man-for- man. With this he sealed his own fate. A tightened Bison defense coupled with the expert play making of Joe Gallagher sent 13 points through the hoop before the home team collected their first tally in the second half. Fifteen minutes after the initial tip- off the Scarlet dumped in their final field goal. Quickly, Mother, My Glasses Strassner hadn't cooled from the rest period as the Brunswick Boys soon found out. If there was an inch of space under the boards, Bucky soon was there to take possession. He took advantage of those openings too, hitting 11 of 16 shots from under the boards. Things were not looking too bright for the hometown boys. They were able to collect but five field goals out of 36 shots taken at the hoop. The most outstanding work of the evening is credited to Joe Gallagher for his fine floor work and team lead ership. The Newark News writeup tells of Joe's constantly passing off his own shooting opportunities to give his teammates a chance to shine. Al though he scored but nine points he was definitely the playmaker of the evening. High scoring honors went to Don Strassner with 28 and Hal Corizzi had 18 for the Rutgers five.

Herd Gridders First Time,
Frosh Cagers Continue Surge;,
Poff Leads With 21.6 Average,"! by Harvey Sheirr The high-scoring freshmen hoop- sters have recorded five victories in their first five encounters prior to last night's tussle with Bloomsburg. Frosh O. K. ""The freshman team is pretty good this year"", stated coach Bill Lane when interviewed. ""We will prob ably have a winning season"", modest ly continued Lane. Then he added with a grin: ""We beat Penn State, that's a winning season."" When asked what the chances for an undefeated season were, Lane re plied: ""You can't tell. Anyone can beat us."" Lane summed up the short interview by saying: ""The team is improving rapidly. The boys have wonderful spirit. Mynott as captain has been a real leader. We are striv ing all the time for improvement, speed, and spirit."" Juniata First The Bison Yearlings began the sea son by nipping the Juniata JV, 47-46 at home December 5. The team tra veled to face the Susquehanna JV and trounced the Indians, 71-35 Dec. 12. December 16 the Baby Bisons wal loped the Lycoming JV team, 58-32 at home. The young Herd showed that the Christmas vacation haa not sap ped their talen twhen they blasted the Penn State freshmen, .51-31 at home January 10. Last Saturday night they overwhelmed Keystone college to the tune of 67-49. Floor Percentage In belting five opponents the Lane- men have racked up 294 points against 193 or their opponents. This gives the Baby Bisons a 58.8 game average against their opponents low 38.6 average. The Bucknell Yearlings have tossed 110 field goals through the hoop and have connected with 74 out of 144 foul shots for a free throw average of 51.4 percent. Poff High Man Jim Poff leads the Lanemen in coring with 108 markers garnered on 41 field goals and 28 free throws for a game average of 21.6 points. Bob Siegel is iunner-up for scoring honors with 62 tallies registered on 28 field goals and ten charity tosses for a game average of 12.4 points. Coach Lane has relied on his top five this season. They are Jim Poff, whose reputation is spreading fast, Bob Siegel, captain Jeff Mynott, ""Easy Ed"" Friedman, and Al Holton. Poff, the high scorer, displays amazing shots from under the basket and is great off the backboards. Sie gel, runner-up for scoring honors, is a good outside shot, superb under the boards, and a good tap-in artist. Friedman is the pivot man who hands off well and does a good job under the boards. Captain Mynott, a small, tricky playmaker remains a steady ballplayer. Holton, who broke into the starting line-up a few con- ] tests ago and quickly proved his worth, aids immensely in scoring punch and in bringing the ball up the hardwood with Mynott. Strong Bench j The Bucknell freshmen hoopsiers are fortified with a strong bench which sees some action in parts of every contest. The players on! the bench are very eager and forc^f the first team to hustle. If the Bison Yearlings keep on play ing the same brand of spirited ball they have displayed so far htis sea son then there is every indication that a fine campaign is in the offering. by Dick Shaw The proud moment which took seven long years to realize took place Monday evening in Davis Gym when Dr. Earl Yeomans, director of athlet ics at Temple University, presented The Old Shoe Trophy to Bison Head Coach Harry Lawrence. . Lawrence Accepts A large crowd was on hand when Coach Lawrence accepted the trophy by virtue of the 35-0 drubbing his footballers handed the Temple Owls last fall. This marked the first time since the inauguration of the tyophy in 1945 that Bucknell has obtained possession. Dr. Yeomans congratulated the school upon the victory and paised the exceptionally fine reltions that have existed between Temple and Bucknell in the past. He attibuted this fine spirit to the workmanlike job done by Dr. Griffith, former head of athletics at Bucknell, and his successor, A1 Humphrey's. The speaker related the history behind the Old Shoe Trophy and pointed out that it has grown to be symbolic of good sportsmanship. Dr. Yeomans presented the trophy to Coach Lawrence who accepted it on behalf of the team. Lawrence then introduced members of the coaching staff and the entire football team. In accepting the Old Shoe, Lawrence stated that the Temple victory had been one of the highlights of his coaching career. Hildreth Speaks Lawrence then presented the trophy to President Hildreth who accepted it on behalf of the school with the re mark that ""We will take good care of it."" He expressed the hope of the school when he stated, ""I hope that the Old Shoe will find a permanent home at Bucknell. engagement of the season and, if the previous Brown and White tilt last December ninth is any measuring rod at all, this promises to be the closest scoring classic on the home court this year. The tilt in Bethlehem was a narrow victory for the Herd, 59-53. Rated Close If the statistics which claim that a basketball home court is worth nine points are correct, then the Bisons must be accorded a nine-point edge over the visiting Engineers- The game couldn't be rated better than a toss-up, even if it was being played on the Brown and White campus. This was evidenced last December. The two very fast fives will take up where they left off last year as the cagers of Coach Tony Packer will be out to take all they can get and a little more from the Guymen. In their last meeting the Bisons came through but they had to fight for it! Slim Win Trailing during most of the contest, a late rally, similar to the Princeton game the evening before, gave the Bisons a six point lead which they * held until time for the showers. It was the closest scoring game to date, but don't count too much on statistics to forecast the outcome of Saturday's tilt. On the other hand, that nine points looks good for the home team, at least on paper. Highlighting the squad, which boasts six lettermen, are co-captains Dick Gratten and Tom VonVertlch. Both are forwards and, over two sea sons have maintained game averages of 9.6 and 9.7 points respectively. Looking at their games to date will show both boys hovering around the 10 point average. In a series which began in 1901, the Herd has downed the Brown and White 13' times while they have suc cumbed to the Engineers 14 times. This could well be the turning point in this long rivalry. Last season the Bisons took the Engineers in two games and if they cop a win Saturday the series will be even at 14 games. iiin iiiiH M iiiw iiin a iitin tn n ifi"

"THE BUCKNELUAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.",
PAGE FIVE,
A,"by Harry Staley Twas the night of January 10, and all through Davis Gym not a creature was stirring, not even a basketball player. No, we aren't celebrating Christ mas early this year; Penn State has arrived in town to play a basketball game. The reader needs no long description of what took place that evening for the results have been the talk of the campus ever since. Coach Jack Guy has summed up the game with the caustic comment that the strategy employed by the Nittany Lions was ""a disgrace to the game of basketball."" Across the gym, in the Penn State locker room, Coach Bob Gross commented that ""the results were gratifying and I may use these tactics again this season."" No matter which side you take on this argument, it must be agreed that both have their merits. The question is, ""Are the stalling tactics employed so effectively last Wednesday detrimental to the game of basketball?"" From the standpoint of the Penn State rooters, it must be agreed that the Nittany Lions were in complete control throughout the ball game. From the standpoint of coaching, State coach Gross won the game, which is exactly what he is paid to do. Strategically, Penn State surprised the Bisons and made a fast-breaking team slow down to a crawl to accept defeat. On the other hand, it remains to be seen just how smart a move Penn State made. We must ask the staid Nittany Lion if the tremendous amount of dis gust generated among the fans was worth one more victory. We must ask the all-knowing lion how long he thinks the people who pay a dollar plus to see this glorified cake-walk will continue to pay the bills. From the comments heard outside Davis Gymafter the forty-minute passing exhibition, they won't continue to do so for long'. One more question. Was Wednesday's game a solid base upon which to cement relations between the two schools? Not since 1947 have the Blue and White cagers met the Bisons, the reason being that the last game ended in a riot. It took threeyears before the effects of that game were forgotten and the rivalry renewed. At a time when relations between both schools needed considerable strengthening it seems to have been poor julgment on the part of the Nittany Lions to employ this type of basketball. Just one more observation before we let this sleeping dog rest in peace. Rule 4, Section 10 of the 1951 basketball rules states that ""when a closely guarded player is holding the ball in his front court and is not making a rea sonable effort to dribble, pass or throw for a goal but is apparently trying to consume time, a held ball shall be called."" The rule goes on to specify that no player may hold the ball in this manner more than five seconds. A closely guarded player is defined as one who is within reaching distance of the ball holder. The point we are driving at is this. Under the present rules a held ball would have been called after five seconds if Bucknell had come out to force the play. There were times during the game when the Bisons made no attempt to force the play for extended periods of time. Possibly the result would have been different if the Bisons had forced State to pass more frequently rather than hold the ball for minutes at a time."

PSSanity Code' Out,"The hotly debated ""sanity code"" of the National Collegiate Athletic As sociation was voted out at the annual meeting of that body held January 10-13 in Balias, Texas. B. U. In Affirmative A1 Humphreys, Athletic Director, attended the meeting and said yester day that many members of the East ern Collegiate Athletic Conference, of which Bucknell is a member, had voted in favor of this amendment, feeling that the ""sanity code"" would not work on a national scale. Bucknell voted in favor of retaining the code, how ever, for two reasons. It was felt that the code was a definite aid to all colleges desiring to keep aid to athletes on a level which they could afford. Secondly, it was pointed out that the E. C. A. C. rules governing Bucknell uphold the same principles found in the sanity code. ""Actually,"" Mr. Humphreys pointed out, ""the revision will not affect Buck nell since the ECAC rules governing aid to athletes are stricter than those found in the sanity code."" No Television The NCAA also acted on the prob lem of television and passed a recom mendation that no college games be televised next season. The recom mendation pertains only to televising games when they are actually being plhyed.

Wrestlers Decision Lafayette,
For Second Triumph This Season,"by Bill Fulmer The Bison Matmen invaded the Leopard's lair last Saturday night and emerged scratched but victorious as they skinned the Lafayette Wrestlers 18- 16 to maintain a spotless record with win number two. Thrilling Match Coaches and fans alike were left clinging to the edges of their seats as the two teams waged a battle that surged back and forth. Team score changed hand s . in both the 157 and 167 lb. classes; and it was not until the end of the 177 lb. match that the issue passed beyond the realm of doubt and into Bucknell's possession. There was nothing doubtful, how ever, about the fashion in which Mar shall Goulding cleaned the spots off his 123 lb. Leopard, Stan Person. Wasting little time, Goulding quickly scored a take-down, and soon convert ed it into a pin with a half-nelson and bar-arm body-press in 1 minute and 10 seconds of the first period. Bucknell 5, Lafayette 0. Mighell Loses At 130 lbs. the Leopard clawed back as Ed Mighell dropped a decision to Lafayette's Back. Keeping it close all the way, Ed scored two escapes for 2 points while Back accumulated 4. Bucknell 5, Lafayette 3. In the 137 lb. class, Bucknell's Roy Cunningham did some clawing back of his own as he pinned Lafayette's Le wis. Suffering a near pin in the second period, Roy came back in the third to take the roar out of his op ponent with a half-nelson and body- press in 1 minute and 55 seconds. Bucknell 10, Lafayette 3. Lou Stuntzner faced an excellent matman in Lafayette's 147 pounder, Bob Downing. The Lafayette captain scored a first period take down and pin for five team points. Robbie Edged Robbie Robbinson wrestled Bill Downing, Bob's twin brother, and dropped a heart-breaker. The La fayette boy scored 5 points with three reversals and an escape, while Robbie collected two take-downs and a re verse to lose the decision 7-6. Bucknell 10, Lafayette 11. With Bucknell behind for the first time in the evening, Nelson Woolcock came out for the 167 lb. event looking for blood. He nearly found it when he gained a near-fall over his oppon ent, Fogelson, in a match that was full of take-downs and reverses. Gar nering 11 points with two take-downs, three reverses, a near-pin and an es cape, ""Nels"" limited Fogelson to three reverses and 6 points to earn the de cision. Bucknell 13, Lafayette 11. Mercer Ends It To protect a slim 2 point lead was the big job resting on Chuck Mercer's shoulders as he faced the 177 lb. Leop ard Xantophles. The action was slow and deliberate. Xantophles drew first blood with a take down, which Chuck later nullified by a reverse. Then, at, 1 minute and 50 seconds in the second period, Chuck brought the stalemate to an abrupt end when he pinned his man with a half-nelson and bar-arm body press. The only spots left to the Leopard now, were all before his eyes as the score became Bucknell 18, Lafayette 11. Lafayette's heavyweight Coad pin ned Bucknell's Harry Durner .with but 17 seconds remaining in the second period of a match that was scoreless up to that point. This was the Leop ards dying throes. Bucknell 18, Lafayette 16."

They were terrific! Their cold stares were wonderful. Their self- control was magnificent. Their ball handling was rigid. Their fouling was subtle. And they won a ""basket ball"" game. Yes, Penn State college should be proud that they went home with the bacon, for an exchange of ham for bacon is fair dealing. They should have an inflated ego, for they don't often beat basketball teams from schools one-fifth their size.

T., where the Clothiers lived in the vets' housing unit. Family of the Week: Srpall, sparkling, dark blue eyes; 8 tiny teeth; a cute, shy little smile-- all of them just 8 months old last Friday. These are the things that make little Maureen Lin Bieber. And "" Maurey"" is what makes an abund ance of happiness in the household of Dolores and Bill Bieber. It was early evening when I chatted with Dodie and Bill, just a little early for Maurey's bed-time. But Maurey i was very, very sleepy and cared little who knew it. As she sat in her mother's lap, her head nodded slowly, and then she was gone. Daddy Bill revived her for assurance she would sleep through the night later. But then, on Bill's lap, she promptly nod ded, folded slowly like a baby bunny, and slipped into slumber again. We all laughed heartily; it was one of those moments of happiness known only to a parent-- an experience whose value cannot be calculated by any tangible means. On a cold, snowy January in 1949, Bucknell Freshman Bill Bieber halted his car at a Williamsport street cor ner and invited a shivering girl to ride to the post office with him. They weren't strangers, having gone to high school together. A romance soon budded, time passed quickly, and in September the girl became Mrs. Bill Bieber. A fter their marriage Dodie and Bill lived in Williamsport before moving to the Village last July. Bill is pur suing an A. B., with a major in math, and will graduate next August. That is, if the Air Force doesn't decide dif ferently, for right now Bill's ""living on borrowed time;"" as a reservist, he's received one deferment and must soon request a second. His active service was with the Air Force, 2 years having been spent in Europe. While Bill is concentrating on his studies, Dodie is taking an active part in the Wives' Club, making many new friends, and most important, making a happy, hospitable home."
Engine-Ears,"by Frank Kelly The final meeting of the semester for the ASME will be held on Thurs day, January 18, at 4 in the afternoon, in Room 208. The Bucknell Engineer's circulation has fallen off quite sharply with the expiration of many alumni subscrip tions, while its advertising context has reached remarkable proportions for a publication of its size. In order to maintain this advertising, the mag azine must meet a required minimum circulation. If you know of any alumni whose subscriptions have ex pired or who do not have subscrip tions, drop them a line about the mag azine. Publication of such a periodi cal does a great deal in boosting the prestige of our Engineering Depart ment and its students and graduates. The next figure in our engineering faculty sketches is Dr. George A. Irland, Head of the Electrical Engi neering Department and Chairman of the Engineering Department. Dr. Irland graduated from ~ Bucknell in 1915 with a BS in EE. Following his graduation, he went to work with Bethlehem Steel where he was night (Continued on Page 7)"

*Anti-Flunk Campaign',
Makes Bull Session Good,"The University of Massachusetts recently completed a full scale ""Anti- Flunk Campaign,"" according to a re port by Robert S. Hopkins, Jr., dean of men. The legend goes: freshmen who dawdle while the leaves fall in October are seldom on campus to view the buds of spring. One reason: too much time devoted to "" bull sessions."" A second reason: midyear exams weed out scholastic lightweights. Believing that many students who flunk out of college are lost because of poor study, habits rather than lack of brainpower, Dean Hopkins seized the deadly "" bull session"" and turned it to good use. Eight weekly "" bull sessions"" on "" How to Study"" were held in fresh man dormitories. Capacity crowds attended, according to Dean Hopkins. Students learned how to take notes, how to budget time, how to improve reading efficiency and how to plan for exams."

Following five years of engineering experience, Dr. Irland came back to Bucknell where he took up his teach ing career. In 1922, he received his Professional Degree as Electrical En gineer, for which he wrote a paper on motor control devices.

The work to wards his MEE was augmented by summer graduate study at MIT and Columbia. In connection with his graduate studies, he became interested in the wdrk of the U. S.

The seismometer is a dis placement type for high frequency vi brations found in quarry and mine blasting. Its use aids in the deter mination of damage to structures caused by these vibrations.

STUDENT TRAVEL CLUB,
ANNOUNCES TOURS,
BEGINNING IN JUNE,"Six all inclusive student tours to Europe, sailing from New York dur ing June and July were announced last night by Ray McCarthy, president of the Student Travel Club, 1841 Broadway, New York City. Student members will t r a v e l throughout Europe in private motor- coaches, staying at first class or de luxe hotels. Each group is limited to 30 members and will have a private courier on the Continent. The tours are coeducational and , chaperoned. Reservations and inquiries are being received by the Student Travel Club, 1841 Broadway, New York City and by all recognized travel agents. 'The tours will sail from New York on June 12, S. S. Washington; June 22, R. M. S. Queen Elizabeth; June 29, R. M. S. Queen Mary; S. S. Constitu tion, two groups; July 7, R. M. S. Queen Elizabeth. The tours feature a club-like at mosphere throughout the entire time, a bon voyage party prior to sailing, and visits in Europe to the opera, theatre, teas, private cabanas, gondo las and gondolier serenading. The tours are of 42, 44, 45 and 67 day periods, which during the past six post-war years of operation have proved most popular. But a fellow has to contend with a great deal more than just a woman's entertainment. He has serious things on his mind, and noble purposes to accomplish.

Annual Examinations In Philly,
Slated For Advertising Hopefuls,"The Atlantic Council of the American Association of Advertising Agencies has announced that the fifth annual A. A. A. A. Examination for Advertising will be held in the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, Philadelphia, on Saturday, Feb ruary 17, 1951, from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. The tests will be open to all who! are considering - advertising as a career, except persons now employed by advertising agencies. Students in college may take the Examination if they are in their senior year. The Examination is given annually by A. A. A. A. Chapters throughout the country to attract high calibre young people to advertising. It is hoped to encourage and guide people who show promise for advertising and to save those with less aptitude for advertising from months of misdirect ed effort in wrong field of work. The examination is comprised of a series of aptitude-temperament tests com piled by specialists in personnel test ing, and a group of tests of practical knowledge development by advertis ing agency executives. Industry vol unteers throughout the country super vise the tests. The Examination is given to deter mine whether the individual appears to have the abilities required for an advertising career. Seven phases of advertising work are covered: copy writing, research, mechanical produc tion, radio and television, media selec tion, layout and art, and plans and merchandising. Also included will be an estimate of the testees' selling ap titudes. Besides serving as an estimate of abilities, the test results may be shown to employers as a concrete in dication of the individual's potentiali ties. If the candidate wishes, he may also authorize the American Associa tion of Advertising Agencies to cir culate his scores among employers in the Philadelphia area. As in previous years, a fee of $15.00 will be charged to cover part of the cost of the examination. Additional information and application blanks may be obtained by writing George Barnard, The Aitkin-Kynett Company, 1400 South Penn Square, Philadelphia 2, Pa."

STUDENTS HIT FROSH SPELLING EXAMS AS UNFAIR,"January 17, 1951 (To The Editor: As "" coaches"" for a few of the freshmen who failed the spelling examination given on Saturday, January 13, we feel compelled to com ment upon the circumstances brought about as a result of the policy of our English department with regard to pselling. As the ruling stands now, two one-hundred word spelling tests were given this semester to all English 101 students. Every student who did not pass the second exam with a minimum mark of 90%, re ceived an automatic F in the course. We are of the opinion that this is a rather unconstructive policy to say the least. We fail to see why poor spellers should be penalized by losing three quality credits and being compelled to repeat a course in which they may be dping satisfactory work in every other respect. Spelling is not taught in class. Responsibility lies solely upon the students to learn to spell as best they can. We are inclined to believe that an individual wh6 has gone through grade school and high school without learning to spell is certainly in need of some kind of assistance. We suggest that the existing policy be modified so that deficient<< spellers will be required to attend a remedial English 102 course which would place emphasis upon mechanics. Why not save faculty and stu dents both a lot of trouble by testing students before they enter Fresh man English, and put them in a remedial English 101 course, or, at least some kind of compulsory, non-credit spelling instruction class where they could receive routine drilling an hour or so each week? Perhaps the English department would consider holding back quality credits a semester, until students who failed in English 101 could go on to 102 and be retested there on the condition that, if they passed this third test, they would receive credit for their 101 class grades. In any case, we believe that a better solution can be evolved with a little thought. Certainly everyone will agree that college students should know tow to spell. Wo should consider this whole problem from the view of obtaining this end in the fairest possible way for all con cerned. We hope that our suggestions will be at least be discussed and that some further consideration be given to the present policy by the English department. We would like to add that students and faculty should be able to discuss matters like this constructively and reach a conclusion that would be acceptable to all. Marjorie Monzert June Christ Ed.'s Note: Although mlny letters and comments have been received on this subject, this letter alone is being printed because we feel it best sums up the feeling of the students. j ? . Q . r . c ,. . ,, (Continued from page 1.) General conditions for enrollment in the R. O. T. C. program require that the student be a citizen of the United States; that he be physically qualified under standards set by the Army; that he be acceptable to the institu tion as a regularly enrolled student, and that he be qualified morally. Age Requirements Regarding age, the regulations specify that the student enrolling in the basic course be not more than 22 at the time of enrollment. The age limit for the veteran entering the basic course is 24. For the advanced course, the age limit is 26. The basic R. O. T. C. course con sists of three hours of formal instruc tion per week, usually two hours of lectures and one hour of practical work. During the first year, instruction consists of a general type applicable to all branches of Army service; for example, courses in first aid, maps and photos, military policy, and evolution o f warfare. Instruction during the second year consists of an introduction to tech- niques used in the branches--either the Corps of Engineers of Transpor tation Corps. Five hours of formal instruction per week are required during the ad vanced course, four hours of lectures and one hour of practical work. The subjects are those common to all branches-- such as military law, ad ministration, etc.-- as well as branch tactics and technique. A six-week summer camp program is required between the junior and senior year at military posts. Engi neers would be sent to Fort Belvoir, William Henkelman And New Staffers "" . . . up the ladder."" Va., and the transportation unit to Foart Eustis, Va. Uniforms will be provided by the Army. They would be worn by R. O. T. C. members to military classes and to others designated by the professor of military science and tactics. Those enrolled in the advanced course would receive a monthly mone tary allowanxe amounting to about $500 for the two years, Major Halpin said. Bucknellians would be eligible for R. O. T. C. under the following condi tions, provided that policies in force on other campuses are adopted here:-- Sophomores (Class of 1954) --  If Bucknell's professor military science and tactics adopts the same policy as is now in effect at Penn State and elsewhere, sophomores would become eligible for enrollment in R. O. T. C. For example, a sophomore would take the first year R. O. T. C. course dur ing his sophomore year; the second year R. O. T. C. course his junior year; the third year R. O. T. C. course during summer school between the junior and senior year, and the fourth year R. 0. T. C. course his senior year. Juniors (Class of 1953)-- The pro- fessor of military science and tactics is unlikely to authorize an academic junior to enroll in the basic course, Major Halpin said, unless he has had previous military service or has com pleted the basic course at another in stitution. Seniors (Class of 1952) -- Seniors with one or more years of training would be eligible for enrollment in the second year of the advanced course under an accelerated program. Upon completion of a six-week summer camp assignment, they would be eli gible for a commission in the Army. A student with less than six months of previous active military service would receive no R. O. T. C. credit, Major Halpin said. The R. O. T. C. credit is applied for service with the Army, Navy, Air Corps, Marines, and Coast Guard, he added."

Ray Anthony Named To Play For Senior Ball On March 9th,
Glee Club Back On Campus After Record-Breaking Tour,
TV Shot Included On Singers',
"Tour Of New York, Philly Area","After one of the most successful tours the organization has known, a tired but happy Men's Glee Club, under the direction of Dr. H. E. Cook, re turned to the campus early this afternoon. o ... -------"
89 STUDENTS LEAVE,
CAMPUS FOR SERVICE;,
ONLY TWO DRAFTED,"Dr. Harold Cook "" . . . climaxes successful tour"" Included in the tour was an appear ance on television station WCAU and a concert before 550 people of the Philadelphia Alumni Club after which the singers were dined and feted in the Egyptian Room of the Rotunda of the University of Pennsylvania. Following the TV appearance, the club travelled to Peddie school where 300 people were entertained. The Sunday evening concert was in the Westfield, N. J. Methodist Church with approximately 400 people attend ing. Bus trouble caused a cancellation of an appearance in New Rochelle on Monday but that afternoon the club sang at South Side High School in Rockville Center, Long Island before 600 students. The featux-e of this program was the appearance of the South Side Men's Glee Club with the Bucknell Men's Glee Club in a per formance of "" Dry Bones."" This was followed in the next three days by appearances in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York before school and church groups totaling close to 3500 people. The "" grand tour"" was climaxed last evening for the wandering minstrels when they sang in the Hotel Commo dore in New York City before a con vention of the Allied Linen Corpora tion. Negotiations will soon be made for the Glee Club to appear in a concert at one of the Lewisburg churches. Of the 89 students who have traded in their white bucks for GI brogans, only two have actually been drafted, it was revealed in figures released re cently by the Registrar's office. Twenty-seven of these men were recalled as members o f the National Guard and other reserve components while 60 enlisted. A breakdown of the 60 volunteers shows that 36 students chose the Air Force, 15 were destined for Navy blue, 5 joined the Army, 2 the Coast Guard, while the Marine Corps was low in popularity with only one enlistee. Although the number of men en listing from Bucknell has zoomed in the past month, it is predicted that a leveling-off period has been reached due to recent legislation which allows the student to remain in college, if drafted, until the end of the semester in which he is currently enrolled and still be free to choose his own branch of the service. Speaking Tryouts 1 Speaking try-outs for the musi- i | cal "" Mile Modiste"" will be held : !.again tonight at 7:30 in Bucknell I i Hall. Both singing and non-sing- : 1 ing roles will be cast."
E,"Placement Meeting For Seniors l The University Placement Bu- i reau will hold a meeting of ail i senior men on Tuesday, February | 13, at 7:00 p. m. in the Vaughan i Literature Auditorium, i Although it is not mandatory for i seniors to attend, it is expected | that those who plan to avail them- | selves o f the services of the Place- I ment Bureau will take advantage | of this opportunity to get their i questions answered and to learn = about the job prospects for June | graduates."
ENGINEER PROFS ATTEND,
CONVENTION IN NEW YORK,"Professor George A. Irland, head of the Electrical Engineering Depart ment and Professors B. H. Bueffe) L. A. Doggett and R. C. Walker, also of the Electrical Engineering Depart ment attended the winter convention of the American Institute of Electri cal Engineers, January 23 to 26, held in New York at the Statler Hotel."
Attitude Of College Students,
Polled As Armed Services And,
Draft Boards Unite On Rulings,
STUDENTS REALISTIC,"The typical attitude of the majority of war-eligible young men at the Uni versity of California is, "" We are bit ter and resigned, frustrated and dis- llusioned, but we aren't triad at any one specifically, and we're not saying to hell with it'."" This, says a recent issue of Look magazine, summarizes the attitude toward the draft it found on the cam puses of four representative colleges, California, Northwestern, Princeton, and North Carolina. The vast major ity of students, the article reveals, would prefer to serve in the Navy or Air Force. The Infantry and Marines are regarded as ""having mighty little future."" There is little hoopla on the cam puses, and not much flag waving. While the students agree Russia is to blame for the current world situation, President Truman has lost their con fidence, and dissatisfaction w i t h Washington leadership in general. As one campus leader at Northwestern put it, "" If the foreign policy were more intelligently handled or at least more clearly and cleanly handled I'd be more willing to go. I'm not going to volunteer . . . .  I'll go when I'm called, but not willingly."" In spite of this, Secretary of State Dean Acheson ""is far and away the most popular"" figure in the Adminis tration, according to the students at the University of North Carolina, and, the article states, ex-President Hoov er's "" Operation Gibraltar"" stand has been widely rejected. A general falling off in the qualit; of class room work is noticeable at Princeton and elsewhere. In fact, at this Ivy League school the standard greeting has become, "" Where d'ya stand?"", meaning in the draft. There is a realistic acceptance of the future by our young men and women, Look concludes. Today'- young student is ready for ""blood and sweat-- but no tears."""
Rushees Now Given Choice,
FROSH CAGERS HOT,"Bill Lane's Freshmen will take a perfect 11-0 record into Wednesday's State game. For the first time in the history of Greek organizations on the campus at Linfield College, rush week this year was conducted under a procedun which gave rushees ""their own choice of invitations. The new experimental rushing plan allowed the rushees an opportunity to indicate whether or .not to accept the proposed wish to be rushed and at the same time gavi them their choice of the groups in which they were most interested."
RECEIVE NEW ASSURANCES,
Summer School Gets Nod From Dean,
As Accelerated Program Is Stressed,"Beginning in June, 1951, the University will encourage students to ac celerate their graduation by accumulating extra credits in the Summer, accord ing to a recent statement from Dean W. H. Coleman's office. More courses than usual will be offered during the eight-week term o f summer school. By attending three or four summer sessions, most stu dents will be able to obtain degrees in three or three and one-half years. Nine or more credits may be earned .each summer, three summer terms being practically equivalent to one year's work. The enlarged program will be of especial advantage to students pur suing the liberal arts, commerce and finance, and education curricula. Many o f the additional courses offered will be those most essential for them. But it also will be of benefit to those studying for other bachelor of science degrees. Some students will wish by its means to lighten their programs for the following semesters. This plan will be especially advantageous for men entering the R. O. T. C., for the military training will make added demands upon their time. In the cases of men liable to be drafted, it is especially important tRat they get into college as soon as they are prepared for it, and so ob tain as nearly a complete education as possible. Their chances of deferment to complete one or more years of col lege work will be improved by their early enrolment. Students already in college also will be able to benefit by the fuller pro gram of summer courses. It seems probable that the inroads on man power made by the increase in the armed forces will make a larger de mand than usual for college graduates in business and industry. This de mand will be for women as well as for men. The sooner all students can prepare themselves for such oppor tunities, the sooner they will be pre pared to be of service. Bucknellians and other students tapped for the draft received new as surance recently that they can stay in school until the end of the term they are presently enrolled in and still en list in the service of their choice. The program is intended to halt a nish by students to drop out of school to enlist in the Air Force or Navy. Ordinarily, students receiving draft notices must go into the Army even though their actual induction might be deferred until the end of the school year. The defense department first an nounced the new plan last week but found it conflicted with existing reg ulations. There also was considerable confusion among the students and draft board officials over how the plan would operate. To eliminate the conflicts and clear up the confusion, the defense depart ment and selective service got togeth er recently to make some additional changes in draft rules to legalize the program: (1) Secretary of Defense Marshall wiped out, as far as college students are concerned, a two-year-old agree ment among the armed services which provided that no service would accept a voluntary enlistment after a man had been notified to report for a pre induction physical examination. (2) Selective Service Director Lewis B. Hershey announced he will re-open in the test month o f the college year the classification of all students who had been ordered to report for induc tion during the year but whose induc tion was postponed under a provision of the draft law allowing deferment of college students. This will open the way for a student in the final month of the term, to pick his service as a volunteer. Under the original plan, the student enlistments would have been accepted only in the two months immediately prior to the final month of the term. The Department's new announce ment stressed that "" each service would accept enlistments only to the extent that places were open for those who desired to enlist."" If a student who has been ordered for his pre-induction physical wishes to enlist in the service of his choice, he must remain in school to the end of the academic year to exercise that choice. Throughout the second semester, on Tuesday afternoons, from 3:30 to 4:30, ""in room 203 Roberts Hall, Dean Mal colm Musser will be glad to answer questions."

TOTAL REGISTRATION,
EXPECTED TO HIT 1900,
FOR NEXT SEMESTER,"Twenty-five to thirty new students will take the place of the approxi mately 50 wh-o were eligible to grad uate at mid-semesters, Registrar George R. Faint announced today. A total of 1,720 students had reg istered by noon yesterday not includ ing the 75 members of the Men's Glee Club or those delayed by the storm or by illness. While the exact number of students for next semester was not determined, Mr. Faint estimated that the number would be around 1900. Other news from the Registrar's office includes.the new grade reports and the new catalogues which were given out at registration. Those who did not receive their catalogues may receive their copies in the mailing room next door to the post office in the Roberts Hall basement. In an attempt to determine student interest in the R. O. T. C. program, the Registrar's office asked each male student to fill out a questionnaide. Questionnaires were also given to women students to find out the enroll ment in the summer school session and for next fall. HELP!

KEYSTONE EDUCATION REPS,
SAID TO BE IN FA VOR OF UMT,
RELIGION-IN-LIFE-WEEK APPROACHED FROM,
"VOCATIONAL ANGLE, CA SECRETARY SAYS","by George Woodward Bucknell's annual Religion-In-Life Week, sponsored by the University administration through the auspices of the University Christian Association, will include this year a new organizational plan that will bring the meaning and scope of the program much closer to the individual student. Because it has been so difficult in* the past to plan a program that would be vital and interesting to all stu dents in all the departments of the University, this year's program has been geared so that each of the major fields of study will have a separate academic convocation. The leaders of these convocations are men and women specially trained in these fields, men who will be able effectively to relate the total program to the individual study groups. The student will then be in a more capable position to understand his own rela tionship to the problems that confront our own University and universities in genex*al. The academic convocations have been studying the problems over the past semester in anticipation of this year's program. Convocations in Engineering, English and Languages, Commerce and Finance, Natural Sciences, and Humanities have been organized, each with a convocation leader prominent in the particular field. Mr. John W. Ryder, president of Norm Advertising, will be the convo cation leader for the Commerce and Finance Division, while Dr. Frederick Pottle, Yale, well-known authority on Boswell, will head up the English and Languages group. Other prominent leaders, to mention only a few, are Dr. Robert Calhoun, of Yale, Dr. Arnold Nash, University of North Carolina, and Dr. John Coleman, of Toronto University. The student chairmanship of this year's program is held by Bud Bush, '51. v For its theme, this eighth con secutive annual program has ""The Christian Faith Confronts the Crisis in the University."" The pre-RILW study groups have used as the nucleus of their discussions Sir Walter Mober- ly's book "" The Crisis in the Univers ity."" This will be the first time that a program of this nature and scope has been attempted on an American university campus. Representatives of 53 Pennsylvania colleges and universities are on record in favor of the universal military training and service bill now before congress. The group also took under advise ment plans for an accelerated three- semester a year schedule for next year similar to the World War Two setup. The representatives also suggested in another resolution that the mini mum number of students returned to college after Army basic ti'aining be placed at 75,000 instead of a maximum return of that number. Ray Anthony "" . . . young man with a horn"" After considering what band to get>> how much to spend, when to hold the dance, and a million other things, the Committee (consisting of Sally Hitch ens, Tom Easley, Ann Cooper, Clyde McAvoy, Ed McGinnis, and headed by- Jack Williams) decided to reach for the stars. Year's Only Prom Since this is the only all-college dance of the year and this will be the last time for many to attend a Senior Prom here, the group went after the best band possible. And they got him! In 1950 the nation's disk jockeys voted him the number one band in America. He is already booked way* ahead for college proms this spring, and his "" ork"" is currently riding the top of Capitol's recording bandwagon. But they still got him! The "" Young Man With The Horn"" is coming to Bucknell at the special request of one of the dance committee. It seems that two years ago this un identified committeeman tried to book Anthony for a Bucknell prom, but lacked the authority to do it. Ray dedicated a Friday night broadcast to our "" hero's"" fraternity, and since then Ray has had a oyal fan. Trumpet Soloist Anthony brings with him a galaxy of Capitol recording stars, including Ronnie Deavuille, Betty Holiday, and the Skyliners; and ' Ray* himself is rated as one of the best musicians in the band business. As a trumpet star he paces his eight-man brass section on both slow and jump arrangements. Some people say that Ray Anthony shows a remarkable similarity to the great band of the late Glenn Miller. If they're right, its probably because Ray's first job in the musical big-time (Continued on page 4.)"
Air Force Will Send Officers To,
Campus To Recruit Student Cadets,"Juniors and seniors interested in officer opportunities in the U. S. Air Force will have a chance to find out all the answers next week right here on the campus. A United States Air Force Aviation Cadet Selection Team will be here from Monday, February 26 to Friday, March 2. According to Major William R .c - Morhous, who is making arrange ments for the team, this visit is one of the many being made to accredited college campuses this year by U. S. Air Force officers to provide college graduates with information on Air Force officer training. The Selection Team will be ready not only to an swer all questions but also is equipped to process any Bucknell men who qualify. Major Morhous stated that there are three courses of training being offei'ed to qualified men. 1. Aviation Cadet Pilot Training consisting of one year of intensive schooling in all phases of aviation. Cadets receive $105 per month during training and upon graduation are awarded commissions as second lieu tenants. Ordered to active duty as flying officers, these men earn pay and allowances amounting to almost $5000 per year. 2. Aviation C a d e t Navigator Training consists of a year's school ing in the latest techniques of radar navigation. Cadets receive $105 per month during training and upon grad uation are awarded commissions as second lieutenants. Ordered to ac tive duty as flying officers, these men earn pay and allowances amounting to almost $5000 per year also. 3. Air Force Officer Candidate School consists of six months of train ing in administrative and technical subjects. Students-- men or women -^-receive pay equal to that of a staff sergeant. Graduates are awarded commissions as second lieutenants and receive all pay and allowances due that rank. Cadets and students who do not complete any of the three courses are returned to civilian life."

Letter* to the Editor,"To The Editor: January 15, 1951. Dear Editor, please, type this on your keys-- 'Tis an issue I fain would defend. (If of reading you're tired, remember you're admired, By those who on you do depend.) In a recent book by Moberly, chapter one, page twenty-three, .... Stands a statement to the effect: "" It's the fault of the school if the student's a fool And his cultural life has been wrecked."" Moberly says in more than one way Our schools to the dogs are going-- But what he implies hastily dies As loyal Bucknellians are showing. We surely all know, as Fosdick would show, The worth of one integrated; He's a creation of art though he need not be smart, His value is seldom overrated. Four steps o f creation with man to relation Are known to most by now; With a little finesse, we might confess Their operation in us somehow. ggPS |. Preparation tho' we shirk 'cause it means lots of work Is given to us by the schools. They prod us thru life with a sharp learned knife-- They take it for granted we're mules. Incubation comes when we go home again And desire to forget about classes. Tho' these post years be dulling, still the unconscious is mulling Everything past and that passes. Illumination-- Eureka! Heaven knows that we seek ya, Though you seldom reward till we're sweatty. You sometimes long stall before you on us call, But you always come when we are ready. Verification suspends till conscious amends Make us that sought integration. 'Tis here that Free Will can make us or kill, , For each man is his own salvation. So we see that the schools only lay out the tools And if eager the students will take ''em. The way students beyond these tools respond Can either make 'em or break 'em. Jonathan"

Bubonic Plague And Green Death,"by George Woodward Comes February Fourteenth and the feminine figure is the target of fashionable fan-mail fetched forth by the fatuous victims of February Fever, You've heard of the Bubonic Plague? And the Green Death? February Fever makes these look like Fauntleroys. And what's this action, anyhow? Who ....... Or what ........ started this Quaint Custom that gives the Queer Qualms to quenchable fires of ...... shh ........ Love? Seems it all started with a guy who | ....... but at this stage of the riot who cares about history. ...... besides, the story ain't half what it's cracked up to be. Anyhow let's be brave and face it ....... the origins hardly seem to justify the ensuing pot-boiling associated with the at best questionable business of loquacious males who feel that they must acquaint an already informed female with the fact that they are embroiled and smitten with said in formed female's exalted charms. The later practice of the formerly neat little custom takes perverted forms that would shock the medieval originator. One guy sends a dozen roses in a heart-shaped box that symbolizes his sentiments, if failing to have any resemblance to that most necessary of all bodily organs. Another sends mounds o f inedible sweets, (Also in the misleading heart- shaped box that fails to have even the remotest resemblance to that most necessary ....... ) that at best could re sult only in the complete destruction of the digestive processes o f his be loved. No doubt she feeds the stuff to her sorority's most violent competi tor. "" Those girls are nowhere ....... really!"" It would be all right if that was the end of it all ....... but the fatuous ones who can't afford to express their sentiments in boxes go even further in their fantastic foolishness. In the mail comes a blood-red heart-valen tine, a picture of crimson hideousity, incongrously trimmed with a fragile bit of feminine lace that makes the gal wonder if the guy has his hor mones confused. Oh, and the verses they do contain! ' "" Gee I wish I had a girl Like you who smiles so sweetly; Whose twinkly eyes and shiny teeth Smote me so discreetly."" ' But that ain't nothing Kid........you should see some of the passionate j ones! Like this one that we found lying under the open hatch of Tillie the Toiler's mail-box: Roses are red, violets blue, Bugonis have their moments Boy I wish I really knew What the score was. Okay, so he got tired of verification ....... But you have to admit the senti ment is there! Effective. ...... effective, we say! The ones that are really clever-- . (as is)-- are the faddish if felineish little epistles that are extremely subtle in the business of politely pointing up a fault in the lady's char acter. This one we thought was the acme of tact: "" What's yer excuse?"" Or, better yet: "" Time and time again I tried To conquer my neurosis. But it takes guts to overlook Your screaming halitosis."" So you don't like this little article. We can just hear those gentle folks who yell and holler and say, "" Who ever wrote that miserable thing is just a mean ol' defamer of a very fine institution."" Why do we write about things like this? Anyhow? Sure, you know ....... we want to draw yer attention. To what? Aw, now look!!! READ The Buckneilian.

Guymen Split Lehigh And State With Cage And Mat Action Slated For Foreign Arenas,
"Herd Evens Lehigh Series 77-57,",
Drop Second Go With State 67-53,". . .  and one for the road."" A familiar phrase uttered from the lips of Bison fans as they left Davis Gym on their last fling before the ivy quieted and silenced reigned supreme on college hill. The Herd had just handed the Engi neers of Lehigh a very handsome drubbing 77-56. It was the beginning of practice sessions to settle an old dispute with Penn State. The vacationing Herd dropped that one in a"
FAST,"ball game 67-53. Packer Unpacked It was a much over publicized Brown and White quintet that took the floor in the Bisons first return en gagement of the current season. The visitors dropped behind eight points in the first period and found it rather difficult to pull within six points of the leaders during their stay on cam pus. The third period was the only time during the evening that the Engi neers came even close to matching the scoreboard figures. The Bison reserves, a highly underrated groun of ball players, continued the scoring spree which their regular brothers had set up for them, but gave ground to Tony Packers charges 19-11 in the third period. Wha Hoppen? The Herd was accorded a nine point edge over the visiting Engineers but showed their ioyal fans that even the best of sportswriters didn't know what they were' talking about. From the outset it looked like a rout and as the final score indicated the Orange and Blue should have been granted fully fifteen points. Tom Van Vertloh and Dick Gratton, Lehigh's able co-captains and high scorers, couldn't find the rim of the new Davis nets and consequently their 9.7 averages fell somewhat. Connie DeLoca had his left-hand hook perfected that evening and not even a canvas bag on his head could have .Stopped his sharp eye. Jackie Web ber's right-hand push from the sides assissted the Bison center in keeping the Brown defense loose. Floor Play Shines The "" Golddust Twins"" set aside their scoring glory and contributed to the team success with some beau tiful floor work. "" * * # Once a system of espionage has been discovered it can and is ren dered harmless."" The truth of this age old FBI verse has been proved time and again but never as effective ly as did the Nittany Lion when he chewed the Herd last Saturday 67-53. Hundreds of acationing Bison fans stayed up to catch the late evening sports cast and find out if the State coach would allow his charges to play basketball or their new type of hard wood contest. As the final story came off the wires there was no doubt as to what had happened. The Lion used the faster-than-the-other-guy f a s t break to down a spirited Herd 67-53."" Remember This? "" State has also heen known to em ploy a possession game more effective than nine points of the law."" The prime example comes to mind as. the encounter in which they waltzed to a 5-3 halftime lead and won a 25-15 de cision which raised eyebrows around the country. The Lions gained a note o f fame or notoriety in that 25-15 vic tory but that was not the case as they employed a more orthodox style last Saturday. State, led by Captain Lou Lamie and Hardy Williams, outscored the Herd in every period but had to wait until the final quarter to pull away and put the game in the bag. At halftime the Orange and Blue trailed by a single point as they left the Rec Hall floor for a much needed rest. Trademark Reverse A second half attack proved the decisive factor for the home boys who held a 30-29 lead at the mid-game mark. Williams and Lamie, both for wards, continued to hit the hoops and guard Ted Panoples began to find his mark. Williams and Lamie bucketed 18 and 17 points respectively while Panoplos garnered 15. Jackie Web ber, Bill Strella, Don Strassner and Joe Gallagher hit the doubles column for the Herd."

MAACKMEN PRETZELIZE,
HAVERF0RD 18-6; BOW,
TO VACATIONING OWLS,"by Bill Fullmer Just to show what Finals can do to the "" best laid plans of mice and men"", Bucknell's Matmen worked the "" Be fore and After"" cliche in reverse when they defeated the Haverford Grunt'n Groaners "" Before"", and then succumb ed to the Temple Owls "" After"" , in two away meets. In a match singularly distinctive for its lack of pins,.Bucknell defeated Haverford by the lopsided score of 18-6. The figures, however, belie the intensity and the closeness which characterized every bout. Each bout was won by a decision, and in only one was the point-difference greater than three. There were several highlights in the match. Marshall Goulding, nearly a "" sure-thing"", suffered his first defeat. Robbie Robinson almost pinned Mid dle Atantic Champion Cadwallader, but was finally decisioned 7-4. And Heavyweight Harry Dumer amassed Bucknell's biggest point-difference (Continued on Page 4)"

Cagers Will Test Pitt And W&J;,
Frosh And Matmen Take To Road,"Bison teams will see plenty of action this week, all of it on foreign soil. Coach Jack Guy's basketeers will blaze a trail west on Friday when they will meet the Pittsburgh Panthers in the smokey city. The next evening will find the Herd at Washington, Pa., where they will engage a strong Washington and Jefferson quintet. * Pitt Weak Pitt is experiencing another lean season in which the Panthers will be seeking their fourth win over the Bisons in a series which began in 1907. The last game between these two schools, in 1934, found Pitt on top, 52-22. However, Dr. H. C. Carlson, head coach at Pitt, is finding the go ing tough'this year with only four vets from his 1949-50 squad. The Panthers will depend mostly on soph omores to turn the tide. Thus far this season the Panthers have won four games and dropped fifteen. They have played two games since returning from the West coast where they found the going pretty tough. In six contests against the western competition the Pitt five fail ed to win. As evidenced in last Saturday's tilt with Navy, the Panthers have the stuff to win. They have played more games on the road than any other team in the nation. This has added greatly to the losing streak. Their four victories have come on their home hardwoods. It all adds up to this-- The Herd will have to be on for the Panthers have a pair of scoring aces comparable to the ""Golddust Twins"" in Mike Belich and Mickey Zemich; and they'll be at home! Second Night Opposite The next evening promises to be a real test for the Bisons. In meeting W. & J., the Herd will take on a team sporting one of the b,est records in collegiate basketball this season. The Presidents have won twelve games this season against a lone set back. Coach Adam Sanders will send his five against a Bison team still seeking its initial win over the Prexy in three court clashes. Paced by Andy Mestrovic, a hook shot artist who tossed in 310 points last season, the Veeps will be seeking their fourth win in a row over the Bisons on the hardwoods. Mestrovic holds the W. & J. single game scoring record of 41 points and in the first five games this season he racked up a total of 102 points or a 20.4 aver age per game. On the other side of the ledger, the Bisons will be out to avenge last years setback 56-45. With Joe Gallagher and Don Strassner, the Bison scoring twins leading the way, the Herd will be seeking win number one over the Presidents. Matmen To Turn Green The varsity wrestlers will head south this week to match headlocks with the Western Maryland matmen. The Bisons will be seeking their fifth win at the expense of the Green.

All : = fraternities are encouraged to par- ; SS ticipate. : See Bob Albert, Phi Gam House # i for information. In a recent interview, Dean Mal colm Musser announced the new policy of the Navy Department toward draft-eligible college students. In view of the recently announced policy by the Secretary of Defense regarding status of draft-eligible col lege seniors and graduate students who have been granted educational deferments, the Navy Department an nounces that a number of appoint ments to commissioned grade in the U. S. Naval Reserve are now being offered to students in this category. Commissions are now available in fields of engineering, business, elec tronics, and communications and for duty as general line officers. Appli cations may be accepted from draft- eligible students who are within 120 days of graduation and from grad uate students enjoying educational deferments. This is true regardless I of whether or not they have received their pre-induction physical examina tion and provided of course they can be processed and granted a commis sion prior to their actual date of in- j duction."""
I,"Dean Musser mentioned that all I students concerned with the above statement should not hesitate to drop into his office, 203 Roberts Hall, where they can obtain information sheets I and preliminary application forms. He went on to say that an Air Force j recruiting team would be on the cam- pus February 26-March 2. and that information concerning aviation cadet pilfct trainings aviation cadet naviga tor training, and the Air Force Offi cers Candidate School could also be obtained at his office or from any one of the men counselors. Dean Musser will be glad to personally answer any questions that students may have on these matters."
SELECTIVE SERVICE DIRECTIVE,"Draft eligible Bucknellians received fresh assurances this week that they would be able to continue their edu cation when Draft Director Lewis B. Hershey told local draft boards they may cancel induction orders for col lege students who intend to enlist and apply for cancellation before the end of the semester. The students, in making a written application, must also give written notice that they wish to enlist in the branch of service of their choice. Hershey said the draft boards at the same time will grant a 30-day post ponement period for such students, to commence at the end of th statutory postponement--that is, on the last day of school. Draft age students now in high school or college have been given blanket postponement of induction until the end of the school term.

Dr. Norman Stewart, chairman of the library com- mitee of. the University Faculty, is in charge of planning the brief informal trand Library. Although the $750,000 building has had several contributors, Mrs. Bertrand has been the chief donor. Students Invited The student body is invited to at tend the ceremony in which represen tatives of the board of trustees, the faculty, the library, and students will participate. The ceremony is being held outdoors at the site of the front door. Dr. Stewart, professor of zoology, will give the invocation which preceeds short speeches to be made by Dr. Mary Wolfe, chairman of the building and grounds committee of the board of trustees; Harold W.

Hildreth, The Bucknell Alumnus, reports of th(c) president, treasurer, and librarian, Bucknell - Bulletins, survey and pic torial maps, wire recordings of the Centennial Commencement and sched ules of athletic games will be placed in the box. Also contained in the box will be group photographs of all fraternities, sororities and BISA with appended lists of members. Center Point Standing on the most commanding site of the campus, the Bertrand Li brary will have two stories and a 40- fo.ot tower with a clock. The library will be the center point of the campus, being able to be seen from distant points. Besides a large reading room and periodical room there will also be an art gallery, a browsing room,' a rare book room (in these rooms it will be possible to hold receptions with the use of the proposed kitchen), a music listening room, seminar rooms for the various departments, faculty study rooms and a visual aids library with a projection room that can seat 100, an office and storage space. The office will be for Mr. Walter Holter, head of the visual aids department. The new projection room will enable the faculty to take their classes there j to see movies. In the Bertrand li brary 400,000 volumes can be accom- modated in six stack levels in the cen tral part of the building; the Car negie library now has 120,000 volumes. Opportunities to participate in ser vice projects are being offered again to college stjidents by the American Friends Service Committee, it was announced today by Lewis M. Hos kins, Executive Secretary of the Quaker organization. These projects include institutional service units, interneships in indus try, in labor unions, and in agricul ture, work camps and community ser vice units, seminars, and institutes of international relations. Three of these projects-- Institu tional Service Units, Interneship-in- Industry, and Friends Service Units in Mexico-- are planned on a year- round basis and are open to appli cants at any time during the year. The two year-round Institutional Service Units are located at Clinton Farms State Reformatory for Women in New Jersey and at Clarinda State Hospital for the mentally ill in Iowa. At Clinton, unit members serve as assistant cottage matrons. At Clar inda, unit members serve as ward at tendants. A third year-round unit will be established at Overbrook Es sex County Mental Hospital in Cedar Grove, New Jersey as applicants are acceptd. The year-round Interne-in-Industry project is held in Philadelphia where a group of ten internes are now gain ing a first-hand experience in the field of industral relations by holding jobs in i factories. Their work program is supplemented by evening lectures, discussion groups, and field trips. Friends Service Units work year round in Mexico in the villages of *Santiago, Nayarit; Valle de Bravo, Merico, and in Nativitas, Xochimilco,"
D. F.,"Their work is closely identified with the efforts of the Mexican people to carry out programs of social ad vancement, particularly in health and education. There will be special summer units o these three year-round projects."
Second Semester,
Enrollment More,
Than Anticipated,"Contrary to the prediction that col lege enrollments would decline due to international conflict, Bucknell has lost only 240 students since the be ginning of the fall term. Included in this figure are the 56 graduate students who received their degrees this past semester. The number also shows that only 90 more students have withdrawn since last February, when 150 students with drew. Exceeding the earlier expectation of a 1900 enrollment, registration figures have increased from 1720 to 1910 in the last week. As there are still some students who have been un able to return and register, there are indications that the registration figure might reach 1925 or 1930. The total includes 30 new students --freshmen and upper-class students either re-entering Bucknell, or trans ferring from other colleges. "" No Curtailment In Faculty"" Although many colleges have been forced to' reduce their faculty staffs because of the sharp decline in enroll ment, the Bucknell administration !does not plan such a curtailment this semester. The educational editor of the New York Times, Dr. Benjamin Fine^ states that colleges have already re duced their teaching staffs by 15 per- I cent, and in some cases by 25 or 30 percent. An estimated number of 20,000 to 25,000 of the nation's college instruc tors will be discharged by next fall j because of the decline in enrollment and financial conditions and the in ability to replace teachers leaving for war industries and the armed forces."

Cranford The Bucknell Debating Society is beginning its second semester activi ties with an extremely active sched ule this week. Four debates are sched uled for the Bucknell campus, while the Bison orators plan to leave cam pus for another seven contests. Tuesday evening Wilkes College won a home and home series with Bucknell. Norman Yaffee and Bob Birnbaum travelled to the Wilkes campus in Wilkes-Barre, while Burt Murphy and Dave Shinn debated here on the campus against a travelling Wilkes team. Mr. Cullen Shipman of Sunbury, an attorney and alumnus, judged the debate here in Lewisburg. Thursday evening two teams from Elizabethtown College will come to Bucknell for a set of debates. Oppos ing them will be one Bucknell team composed of Dorothy Morgan and Charles Swope, while the other Buck nell team will consist of John Mc- Fadden and Harry Kurz. The judges will be Miss Helen Royer of the his tory department and Mr. Robert Gross of the English department. The de bates will be held at approximately 7:15 p. m. in the Vaughan Literature Lounge, and all interested students and faculty members are cordially in vited to attend. Friday morning two Bucknell teams will leave for the Washington-Balti- more area, where double debates are scheduled with three collges. Friday afternoon the Bucknell men will be guests of Howard University; Friday evening they plan to debate at Cath olic University of America;.and Sat urday at noon they will be at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. One Bucknell team will be made up of Norman Yaffee and Charles Swope, while the other team will be George Weber and Jack Bailey. Saturday afternoon at 2 p . m. a team from Saint Francis College will visit Bucknell, and they will be op posed by Bon Stevenson and Dave Shinn. Professor Frank Merritt of the English department will be judge. ing defense program. Selective Service said a great deal of confusion had resulted from the two orders, and therefore the explan ations today were deemed desirable. The armed services agreed in A u gust, 1948, that they would not accept a voluntary enlistment after a man had received notice to report for his pre-induction physical examination. (Continued on page 8.1 told the Bucknell Chapel audience yes terday, in his address entitled, "" The Dream that Made America Great"". Dr. Cranford, noted pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church, Washington, D. C., said that too often in the world today the question is asked, "" Which is more important, the individual or the state?"" Russia's Lenin once wrote that the common people would not know what was best for them."
"New Science Building, Swimming",
Pool Foreseen,
In,
Future Plans,"With one century of development and growth past, Bucknell is now looking forward to its second century of progress. To help further this added expan- sion, the University has established a new office in the administration-- the Director of Development, headed hy Mr. Alfred H. Fenton, of Bruns wick, Maine. It will be his job to secure funds from corporations, foundations, and individuals for the University. These funds fall into three priorities: En dowments, principally for faculty sal- j aries, so that Bucknell can hold her strong faculty and at the same time compete in the open market for future instructors; scholarships, so that the University can continue to compete with other institutions of her size for the much sought-after ""ail around"" student; and capital funds, so that Bucknell can construct new buildings. Bucknell completed the heating plant, which was the first of its second century building projects. Work is now being done on the library which is expected to be finished in the spring. But Bucknell's Second Century De velopment Program does not stop there, for many more projects are in the making. The University hopes in the near future to remodel the old library, then later, to build a Science Building, a Chapel-Auditorium, and a Social Science Building. Also on the agenda are plans to complete Davis Gymnasium and the Vaughan Literature Building. Plans for Davis Gymnasium show there is to be a wing on each side of the building. A  swimming pool will oc cupy one of the wings. Vaughan Literature Building will have another wing on the other side of the audi torium; it will be identical to the wing now on the south side of the audi torium. Since the first of the year, Mr. Fen ton has been organizing a develop ment program, a long and difficult job. Working in conjunction with the administration and those interest ed in Bucknell's future, Mr. Fenton has already set in motion a plan to increase endowment funds through future bequests and is currently pre paring presentations to industry and certain foundations on behalf of Buck nell. But he refuses to be either optimis tic or pessimistic about the future. 'The field is fertile,"" Mr. Fenton says, ""and if enough time is allowed for seeds to mature, the harvest should be a good one."""

A Different Kind Of Brotherhood,
People of onr generation who set out to call attention to,
themselves or their organization have gotten into the habit of,
setting aside a specified week of the year and bestowing upon it,
the name of the cause in which they are campaigning.,"Some of these are trite, niggling, and about as necessary as three thumbs. And some, on the other hand, are conscientious efforts to bring som ething worthwhile to the attention of the American people."
In his latter category comes the observance sponsored by the,
National Conference of Christians and Jews called Brotherhood,
"Week which begins this Sunday, February 18th and continues",
"through the 25th. Unlike some of the other projects of this sort,",
Brotherhood Week doesn't require that you spend a certain num,
ber of hours of the day making peaceful overtures to stray tom,
"cats, or knitting nose-warmers for the underprivileged three-year-",
olds of Central Afghanistan.,"After scanning the literature (or propaganda, if you w ant) sent out by this organization, we gather that about all Brother hood Week observance at Bucknell would cost us every day for seven days is a few minutes in Chet's to stop and talk to that guy from the other House that you've seen around so much recently; or show a little more understanding of the other fellow's view point in that next bull session on religion ; or maybe just a big hello for that guy in your dorm with the funny last name."
"These people don't ask too much, and who knows . . . we",
might learn something.,
The Gripes Of Wrath,"T he Hilltop movie has been the starting place for many in cidents, amusing, and otherwise. One of the most recent of these centered about two financially stricken coeds who decided to a t tend a Friday night show. They pooled their resources and found that they had the dissillusioning total of two cents. However, realizing that at more prosperous times they had contributed m ore generously, they started for the show with clear con sciences. But when they reached the Lit Building, they found a glaring sign announcing a price of 35 cents, and an overseer whose haughty countenance reduced the girls to shame."
The Hilltop is SUPPOSED to be run for the benefit and en,
joyment of the students.,
"Contributions are given willingly, al",
though it remains a mystery why the school can't support such a,
venture.,"But, when an arbitrary price is required, people begin to w onder what they are paying for. Is it atm osphere? One girl rem arked as she sat down, ""I expect a professor to come in any m inute and pass out some tests."" Those who know, claim it's not ventilation, tem perature, condition of the""'films, newness of the films, or condition of the sound effects. Some say it might be the cost of converting all technicolor films into black and white. Yet, another group m aintains that it couldn't be the cooperation that the theaters gives struggling college enterprises. To coin a vulgar phrase, ''There ain't none."""
"The Hilltop is good for the students, but at times its policies,",
as well as its movies are blurred.,

P.)--The official grading system of Wheaton College, effective this year, specifies the use of letter grades, with plus and minus devi ations. This system substitutes the previous one in which numerical values were assigned by the faculty, but which appeared on student report cards as letter grades. Voted in by faculty decision, the first grades to be affected are the marks received by freshmen at mid-semesters. * * * * * Davidson, N. C.--(I. P.)--As the result of an experiment made at David son College last year, the student body has opened a ""Serve Yourself"" store on the campus. It is pointed out that were it hot for the honor system in effect here, this store would be an impossibility. Stores of this nature are now being operated in many colleges in the country. Best known of these stores is that at Washington and Lee Univer sity, Lexington, Va., where all kinds of student supplies are priced, placed before the students and the cash drawer left open for the student to make his own change, This store has been effectively operated for several years and is an object of pride of every Washington and Lee student. It is the desire of the authorities and the students at Davidson to make the Honor Store on this campus one of equal merit with that of Washington and Lee. The plan, instituted this year as a test, will become permanently estab lished if it proves successful. The Student Council acts as the Board of Di rectors for this enterprise. $ $ jf: $ j|e When cleaning shops in Norman, Oklahoma raised their prices last week, Oklahoma University's student senate called for a boycott. They proclaimed ""Saggy Sooner Days,"" making spotted, unpressed clothing the style until the | cleaners back down. The students at Oklahoma U responded immediately as independents and Greeks joined forces to put the pressure on the cleaners, j After six days no settlement had been reached but one cleaner was quoted in the Oklahoma Daily as saying, ""He was losing money and didn't want to see it (the boycott) go any farther."" He added that several other Norman cleaners felt the same way and suggested that something might be worked out. At noon on the eighth day, with no settlement reached, Oklahoma students settled down for a prolonged campaign and set up picket lines in front of cleaning firm>> near the campus. * * * * * Easton, Pa.--(I. P.)--Retarded reading and broken homes are among the main causes for students' failures in college, Prof. Frank R. Hunt,- dean of students at Lafayette College, says after a three-year study of reasons for failures. Dean Hunt asserts that too many students arrive at college with inade quate preparation, a limited vocabulary and a general inability to comprehend issues from the printed page. The remedy, he suggests, is smaller classes, more teachers, a more careful selection of those planning to prepare for college and more personal attention to those students. If these are the main causes for failure, then morons can stop worrying. * * * * * Lancaster, Pa.--(I. P.)--A cooperative program enabling engineering stu dents to obtain a broad general education before concentrating on a chosen special field of science or technology has been effected by Franklin and Mar shall College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Under the plan; students may elect to complete three years of the regular liberal arts program here, with emphasis on the basic sciences and mathemat ics, before entering on two years of specialized study in one of Rensselaer's major departments. After completing certain requirements at Rensselaer these students will receive the bachelor's degree from Franklin and Marshall. Upon satisfactory completion of the two-year course of study at Renesselaer they will also receive the bachelor's degree in engineering. * * * * * At the University of Nebraska last month the Daily Nebraskan lost its temper. A group known as Theta Nu Epsilon attacked and beat up a student as he was about to enter his home on campus. This was the most violent dem onstration TNE had yet staged; previously they had contented themselves I with splashing paint an sidewalks. In an angry front page editorial the Nebraskan demanded that the admin istration take prompt action against students belonging to this ""sub rosa or ganization,"" and if necessary, ""suspend them all."" This chant was repeated five times, each in a separate paragraph. ""This new outburst of vandalism,"" the Nebraskan cried, "". . . is an indi cation of what the organization may do in the future if allowed to continue its existence . . . The student body must not stand idly by and watch one of its members be roughed up for no logical reason except that it gives the group pleasure and shows to the rest of the campus that 'they can run the school if theyplease'.' The solution: ""Suspend them all."""

This com plaint seems to be common among the college students of today. Bucknell's Religion-In-Life Week seems to have found a solution to this problem. The resident discus sion groups planned for this week will be ""bull sessions"" lead by individuals who have had much experience in various fields and are prepared to guide the discussions so that the par ticipants may find some solution to their problems. Floor Leaders Each floor has chosen a leader to guide its discussion. These leaders have been chosen from many fields; Y. M. C. A., W. S. C. F., Deans and Chaplains of colleges, Engineers, men from all professions, rabbis, priests and ministers. These people will visit the various dorms, houses, sor ority suites and fraternity houses at different times These leaders will guide the stu dents in questions Raised by Mober ly's Crisis in the University. Such questions as: ""What's wrong with University student-faculty relation ships?"", ""How can colleges prepare you for the future?"", and ""What's wrong with Dorm life?"" will be dis cussed. These, however, are not limited subjjects. All types of stu dent problems will be ""hashed over"". ""Primary Talks Held"" Prior to these discussions prelimin ary discussions are being held on many floors. These will be led by student or faculty members and will prepare the students for the discus sions during RILW and help them to formulate their questions. Resident discussion leaders (aided by counseors in the men's college) on each floor are organizing and promot ing plans for these discussions. They are headed by Don Brown, Mary Anne Fritz and Bob Carmen. If you wish more information on speakers, subject matter or any other question involv ing the discussions, why not consult them? Students, this is your chance to have a ""bull session"" with the added good of having someone there who knows what it's all about."

Bullets Aiming For Fifth,
Consecutive Win Over Herd,"very unusual battle with Pittsburgh University 67-45. That which makes it unusual were the conditions under which the court tilt took place. Just A Bit Cool The Panthers hardwood seems to be located underneath the football sta dium! The temperature was close to freezing causing belated reflexes by both clubs. The conditions were so ideal for a fall football game that even Jack Guy was forced to keep his overcoat on during the game. The crowd was a tiny 350, about half of which were Bison followers. The Panthers entered the contest with a not too impressive record of four wins as against fifteen losses. They had recently returned to their home floor after a lengthy road trip that took them to almost every part of these 48 states. This was only the fifth home contest and they were de- ermined to make something of it. Panthers Take Lead The first quarter went rather slowly as the boys became accustomed to the climate change and cramped condi tions. At the end of the period the Bisons had garnered a slight one point lead 15-14. In the second ten min utes Pitt notched 21 markers to the Herd's four. This gave the Panthers a lead they never relinquished. The Herd caught fire at the start of the hird period and pulled within eight points of the Blue and Gold. The Carlson cagers would have none of this so the lid went on for the rest of the night. The fourth quarter again found the smokey city boys on a scoring rampage which salted away the victory. Statistically speaking the Herd didn't fare too well. Foul shooting put the Bison at 43 percent compared to 66 percent for the Panthers. From the floor the Panthers also outscored the Herd 24-17.

The Bison five awakened from their previous evenings doldrums and came through with a fine fast break. The major tasks of handling the back bonds went to Connie DeLoca, Bucky Strassner and Joe Gallagher. Bucky's hook was true and Jackie Webber handed out numerous assists with his left-hand push.

The Bullets have been victori ous over the Herd in the last four games including the two games last year when they triumphed 73-71 and 69-65. However, since last season, the Bul lets have lost three of their regulars including All-Stater Bucky Harris. Forward Harry Pure and guard Ross Sachs also graduated. Even Steven Thus far this season the Bullets have won six and lost an equal num ber. In comparing scores the game should be a toss-up since. Gettysburg has lost to Penn State, Cornell, Pitt, Lafayette and Muhlenberg by scores very similar to those inflicted upon the Bisons. At the present time the Bisons have played two more games than G-burg and sport a six and eight record. Coach Henry T. Bream, who is in his 24th years as coach at Gettysburg, will depend heavily on guard Hank Belber and forward Bob O'Brien to carry the scoring burden. O'Brien scored 224 points last year while Bel ber tallied 159. Belber is particularly effective from outside. Diplomats Here On Wednesday evening the Herd will entertain the Franklin and Mar shall quintet in Davis Gym. The Diplomats will enter the game with a record of 4 wins against 5 losses. The visitors hold decisions over Le high, Dickinson, Swarthmore and Haverford while bowing to Navy, Gettysburg and others. A highlight of the contest will be the appearance of Walter Lenz, soph omore pivotman, who now stands eighth in the nation in scoring among small colleges. The six feet four-inch center has a game average of 22.4 per game. In eight, contests he has amassed a total o f 179 points. If the past performances of these two teams mean anything the contest should be a high scoring affair. Last year two new records were established when the Bisons trounced the Diplo mats 98-54. The Herd total repre sented the highest number of points ever obtained by a winning team while the total number of points was 123, John Loose; 130, Jim Woods: 137, Jack Leidy; 145, Fred Hoenning- er; 157, AI Creist; 167 A1 Hershberg er; 177, Jim Spangler; and in the un limited heavyweight division,"" John Tuesday evening the Bisons will I play host to the Ursinus College | wrestlers.

FTVE,"by Harry Staley At the risk of being called a journalistic gravedigger the old bone of contention in reference to Intramural All-Star teams is about to be dug up Again. Mural basketball is just getting underway and before it is too late this reporter is of the opinion that something should be done about an IM All- Star team. For a number of seasons it has been the policy to select an All-Star team of those men participating in fraternity basketball. Past the actual stage of naming a first and second team plus several honorable mentions an actual ""dream team has usually not been given the opportunity to display its talents. Before the season disintegrates and passes, why can't we see these men in action? With three leagues in action it seems that some sort of arrangement could be made to match all-star players from each league in a contest to determine the stronger league. Or, why not pick an overall all-star team and match them against a similar team from a nearby college? Expenses could be held to a minimum. The irfterest shown in Mural basketball indicates that such a , contest could prove to be a drawing card. Rollin' Right Along Like Old Man River, the wrestling team is still rollin' right along in the process of enjoying one of their better seasons. The matmen have shown the lights to their opponents four times and suffered only one defeat thus far this season. Thus far Herb Maack's charges have been strictly a road team, hav ing wrestled four times on the road with only one appearance on home ground. Highlight of the season will be the Middle Atlantic tournament which will be held in Davis Gym on March 2 and 3. Wrestlers from all the middle at- lantic schools will be vieing for honors in a mat card which should be a corker. Next weeks match with Gettysburg should provide some sort of a prevue concerning Bison chances in the tourney. The Bullets won the crown last year and have been a power in the tourney for several years. A victory over G-burg could indicate good fortune for the Bisons. The Real Fan A1 Abrams, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette sportswriter, recently revealed the nature of a true basketball fan. The true court rooter is similar to the ardent supporters of the Bradley Braves. Abrams points out that in the town of Peoria, 111., where Bradley is situated, fans have been buying tickets for games five years in advance. In addition he reveals that the Bradley rooters usually rush home from each game to their radios where they hear a re-broadcast of the game for points they might have missed. And then the next morning the Brave rooter delves into the morning paper for additional facts about the preceding evenings game. And then we have Bucknell. f  ,"
Tustin Tales,"by Joan Morris BACK*TO NATURE Tet It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow No electricity, no heat (except a small stove), no running water, no modern conveniences, but plenty of skiing, tobogganing, and ice skating featured the WAA Cabin Party week-1 end at a hunter's lodge near Halfway Dam last Saturday and Sunday. Senate, Mortar Board, H o n o r House, Mrs. Hildreth, Miss Stevenson, and the women's physical education teachers were the guests of WAA in this return to the "" wilds"" of nature. | Supplies were towed up the hill to the lodge by the muscle (?)-bound dam sels who found themselves dealing with a coal stove, kerosene lamps, and other "" unknowns,"" the likes of which they'd never seen. Feeding Famished Females The meals, planned by Chris Riley, succeeded in satisfying the twenty some odd famished females who j tramped through the mountains,' ca reened down the slopes in the tobog gan and on skiis, and cut figure eights on fhe frozen lake at Halfway. Everyone pitched in to make this weekend a memorable one. .Hank | Harris was official dish washer and I fire-saver. Lynn Ruth and Bobbie Snyder were the life of the party (at"
j,"each other's expense). Sylvia Har- baugh hovered knowingly over the sizzling Saturday night hamburgers I surrounded by her many assistants. Miss Nechi, Miss Appenzeller, and Miss Brown can well be recommended as ""egg-friers"" in any good restaurant for the job they turned out Sunday j morning in serving the late risers (who had gabbed and giggled far into j the night).

First to be in his draft call will be the quarterbacks. The squad will re ceive instruction via lectures and au dio-visual aides. Following these in struction periods there will hold forth in Davis Gym, the spring round-up, known as indoor practice. In April all the candidates will move outdoors. Coach Lawrence said: ""In past years we have been preparing all the plays we user the previous year, but this spring we will concen trate on the basic fundamental form ations."" When asked how the military draft would affect the pigskin parade to Memorial Stadium next fall, Coach Lawrence replied: "" I am optimistic. If the boys will keep up their academ ic work we should be able to have plenty of good men available for the gridiron. ""I would like to see plenty of boys out for the squad,"" continued Lawr ence.

Engine Ears,

Do you believe the honor system,
should be used for both,
men,
and,
women on campus ?,
There seems to be quite a hullabaloo,
around campus about the merits of,
the present honor system..,
As of,
"now, only the fair maidens of this",
campus are on their honor for coke,
"dates, coming in at 12:30 on Fridays",
"and Saturdays, and etc.",
"However,",
some erstwhile authorities,
on,
this,
subject would have the honor system,
"include examinations, and having our",
men on campus set a time limit on,
themselves.,
"As for saying which is right, we do",
not know; but perhaps the opinions,
of various personages I have convers,
ed with at great length on the subject,
will let you decide for yourselves.,
"Therefore, we proceeded (quick like",
a bunny) to,
Larison,
living room,
where we met Pat Forlifer strumming,
away on the piano.,
Pat gave us a rather roundabout,
"reply: ""Well-theoretically, it's a won",
"derful idea, but it would",
actually,
"never work. Boys will be boys!""",
Aha--that's a little gem of wisdom,
in itself.,
Remember that girls!,
Cindy Luks and Nan Martin also,
dropped by and ventured a few choice,
words of wisdom?,
"Cindy--""No!",
Men are never hon,
"orable!""",
"Hm-m-m-m. A cynic perhaps, no?",
"Nancy--""Oh yes!",
It would be un,
fair to the girls if just the girls were,
on their honor and the boys would,
"take advantage of it.""",
Ahem!,
Carify,
that,
statement,
please!,
We then decided to take the view,
point of the opposite sex. It seems,
the men on our campus are rather shy,
"about having their ""John Hancocks""",
"in print, so well just give a few vital",
statistics about each one and let you,
guess the rest!,
The first man on our list is a very,
"active member in Cap and Dagger,",
"sings in the Men's Glee Cub, and is",
a Theta Chi. He lives in 309 East,
Wing and is very fond of plaids--,
Need I say more?,
He sums the whole question up in,
one rather assuming point of view:,
"""No, because the people who are go",
"ing to cheat would cheat anyway!""",
"Well, now the question is: Just who",
is going to be dishonorable enough to,
cheat ?,

Blundering Staffer Recites,
Trials Of Embryo Reporter,
by Bob Bell,
At 3:42 I slowly eased open the door of the BUCKNELLIAN office. A sa,
"prospective new addition to the staff, I was awed by the sight that met my",
eyes. Typists were batting out two hundred words a minute; the floor was,
"littered with rejected material; Mac, the editor, was begging the printer for a",
two minute time extension; and I went unnoticed. I went back and slammed,
the door. It didn't work.,
Mac announced that the extension,
-----,

DEBATE RECORD LISTS,
"14 WINS, 7 LOSSES",
FOR FIRST SEMESTER,
had been granted and the office re,
laxed.,
The typists slowed to one,
hundred and,
eighty,
"words, and I",
opened the window to get some air.,
The gentle Lewisburg breeze filled the,
"yoom with flying copy, Mac stepped",
over and gently rebuked me.,
"""Mac, I've Got It!""",
As I was picking myself off of the,
"floor, Bill Bellamy, news editor, skidd",
"ed in gasping, ""Mac, I've got it. That",
last story we need to fill the front,
page. I can see the headline now . . .,

The staff went wild as they realiz,
ed that their work was finished for,
another week until the small voice of,
"the lay-out man announced, ""We're",
"Still one, column short."" For 30 prec",
"ious seconds the room was still, then",
Bill raced out into the hall and,
the echoes' of a shot rang out. Mac,
"Stepped outside, and in a moment re",
"turned clad in black, two large tears",
polling down his cheeks.,
"""Gentle",
"men,"" he said, ""We have our story.",
"Bellamy's obituary.""",
As I was hurrying from the sad,
"scene, my foot kicked the jacket of a",
blank pistol shell and my nose detect,
ed a sharp vegetable odor. Laugh,
"ingly I said, ""O. K. faker, you can get",
"up now. Your catchup is showing.""",

The won and lost record,

The group engaged in a total of 25,

How dignified it looks sitting among a pile of shirts at one of the downtown Lewisburg shops! First, why didn't the administration see fit to display the trophy for a reasonable time on campus for the enjoyment of the students? After all, it was their team that won it. Secondly, if it is to be displayed downtown for the benefit of everyone, why was it not displayed properly in a window not cluttered with merchan dise ? Let us hope that in the future the administration will use a little more discretion. Sincerely, Herb Sehloo"
Artist Bruce Mitchell,
Returns From Mexico,"Bruce Mitchell, Bucknell artist in residence, has returned to this cam pus from Mexico for the spring se mester. Mr. Mitchell spent some time in that country where he found many new subjects for his brush. On his way east he gave a painting demonstration to the students and faculty of the Kansas Art Institute, using as his subject the fishermen of Lake Patzcuaro. Last fall he was visiting artist at the New Orleans Academy of Art. As in previous years, Mr. Mitchell has arranged for a series of one-man exhibitions and personal appearances this spring by leading American ar tists."
GUILD PLAYERS GIVE,
PLAY 'SILVER WHISTLE',"1 T~ Bucknell students will have an op portunity to see the Lewisburg Guild Player's presentation of a popular Broadway play, "" Silver Whistle"" ."
A,"comedy written by Robert McEmroe. It will be presented the 22nd and 23rd of February at the Lewisburg High School. This play was presented very suc cessfully on Broadway, starring Jose Ferrer. A movie is also being made with Clifton Webb in the lead. "" Sil ver Whistle"" is a philosophical drama about old age. It takes place in an old folks' home when a tramp happens to stop in and humorously convinces the inhabitants o f the joys of old age. Professor Hooker, of the English Department is directing the produc tion and also takes a role in the play. Two Bucknell students, Don Cole and Ed Davis, will be in the cast. . Miss Dorothea Groezinger, one of our dieti tians, is also a representative of Buck- hen who will participate.

His record for the short way out is at 35 seconds. The Bears in each of the last two seasons lost only one dual meet. At the 1949 Middle Atlantics they placed second and picked up fifth spot last year at Delaware. D^ar Editor: The writer of this letter has no claim to fame as either a scholar or a ""gentleman."" At times I have been accused of a few minor vices around campus. However, I have now dis covered that I am a paragon of virtue on this campus. W hy? That is an excellent question. The answer is that I have heard the rumor that some character politely stole the March of Dimes box out of Roberts Hall. I don't think that I need say more on the subject. The students of Bucknell will say the rest.

GREEKS- WILL HIGHLIGHT POST-EXAM JUBILEE,
'Best Senior Prom Ever' To Feature March Moods Theme,
Busy Seniors Plan Ball;,
'51 Men Will Elect Queen,"The Senior Prom, soft lights, the smooth music of Ray Anthony's orches tra, and your favorite date-- mix them all together and you have the ingredi ents for a perfect evening. The date, March 9; the time 9 to 1 ""' o'clock. Circle that date on your cal endar, for Betty Mather and Richie Ryan, co-chairmen of the Senior Dance committee have promised, "" This will be the best Senior Prom ever presented."" Flo Jessee and Dick Larson, chair men of decorations, have revealed the theme of the dance--"" March Moods"". Sounds intriguing, dosn't it? Davis Gymnasium will be transformed into a depiction of the transition from winter to spring with the cold winds' and falling snow of winter contrasted with the balmy breezes and swaying trees of early spring. Committee Chairmen Chosen The dance committee chairmen have been chosen by the class officers. Ed McGinnis, as business manager, will have charge of all finances of the dance. Chris Riley and Doc Lyons head the Chaperon Committee, and Nick Packs will take care of the pro vision of the flowers. Arnie Pechulis and Jack Maeby are chairmen of the Door Committee, and Jack Henderson and Bill Miller are in charge of pro viding furniture. The large billboards that will soon be posted in strategic places on the campus and the music of Ray Anthony coming from loudspeakers are due to the ingenuity of the co-chairmen of the Publicity Committee-- Lyn Ruth and Skippy Hess. Queen To Be Elected Lorry Yaufman McBride and Har vey Bush, chairmen of the Queens Committee, have announced that this year the Senior Queen, who will be crowned the night of the dance, will be the candidate who receives the highest number of votes among the men in the senior class. The identi ties of the candidates for queen, who were elected Wednesday and Thursday of this week, will be revealed in next week's issue of the Bucknellian. Abe Powelson and Joe Mason, presi dents of the sophomore and junior classes, respectively, have given their, support to the Senior Prom by serv ing as Honorary Sophomore and Junior Chairmen. Woody Woodward is in charge of | the distribution and sale of tickets. The tickets, priced at $5.00, will go on sale this week. They may be ob tained through fraternity and BISA representatives or they may he pur chased at The Bison. The Band Committee, headed by Jack Williams, '51, was considered most successful in the procuring of Ray Anthony for this year's Ball."

Wins To Record,"The Bucknell Debating team com peted successfully with four colleges this weekend. The question at each of these debates was--Resolved: Non communist nations should form a new international organization. On February 15, Bucknell played host to Elizabethtown College. Doro thy Morgan and 'Chuck Swope, taking the affirmative, won; while Harry Kurtz and John McFadden, debating the negative aspect of the question, lost a close decision. On Friday some Bucknell debaters traveled to Howard University and Johns Hopkins. Norman Yoffee and Chuck Swope, affirmative, won at Howard but lost to Hopkins. Jack Bailey and George Weber came home with a clear slate, winning at both schools. The group returned to cam pus Saturday afternoon with three wins and only one loss. On Saturday afternoon here at Bucknell Dave Shinn and Burt Mur phy took the negative side competing with St. Francis College. There was a split decision. There are two more debates sched uled in the near future. On Feb. 22 two teams will be sent to a tourna ment at King's College in Wilkes- Barre. Ronald Unger, Jack Bailey, Bill Nicholas, and Ernie Kestler will travel to Mount Mercy College in Pittsburgh on. Feb. 24 to compete in an annual tournament. Will Be Hit"
Reserve Is Authorized,
To Procure Applicants,"Hildreth Addresses NY Alumni President Horace A. Hildreth will be the principal speaker at a meeting o f the Metropolitan Alumni Associa tion in New York City today at the Beekman Tower Hotel. Dean Musser announced yesterday that the commandant of the fourth naval district has been authorized to procure a total of 483 male and 63 female applicants for enrollment in the Navy's 1951 Basic Summer Train ing Program for Reserve Officer Can didates. This program was established to provide enough newly commissioned and qualified Naval Reserve officers to keep the reserve at authorized strength. It is especially designed for officers who may eventually quali fy for a commission in the Line (in cluding aviation and specialists). All candidates for this program are se lected from college students. According to the Dean, this pro gram is in keeping with the Navy's recently announced officer procure ment program which will canvass the nations universities for qualified can-; didates. For further information, see Dean Musser, room 203, Roberts Hall. The American Council on Education reported recently results of an in quiry into the 18-year-old draft situ ation which indicated that the col leges of America might not be hit as hard as many educators had feared. From its analysis of available facts, the council reached the conclusion that if the bill was passed in its orig inal form not more than 7% per cent of the prospective male freshmen would presumably, be affected next summer. This tonclusion was based on these premises: 1. A maximum of 50 per cent of the typical male freshman class would be 18 or older. 2. Spokesmen of the Department of Defense have testified that the arm ed forces could absorb in the first year, only 60 per cent of the avail able 18-year-olds. 3. Induction so far as college students are concerned could take place only during the three summer months since the bill provides that students becoming eligible for induction dur ing a college year shall not he in ducted until the end of that year. Other factors that might result in a still lighter drain on college fresh men enrollment were given as follows: At least 10 per cent of all high school graduates are not qualified for military service. There will be some increase in the number of veterans wTho will begin their courses this sum mer in order to take advantage of the G. I. benefits before the July 25 dead line for starting courses. * The council said that if the bill was passed with the amendments voted by the Armed Forces sub-committee of the Senate, which would direct local draft boards to take first of all those eligible in the 19-to-26 age group be fore inducting 18-year-olds, there should be no appreciable effect on freshman male enrollment in the fall of 1951. 4s to total male college enrollment next fall, the council predicted that if the* 18-year-old draft went through, these younger men probably would be taken in preference to those now in college, so the colleges would retain a substantial proportion of their pres ent students. Dr. E. Fay Campbell of Philadel phia warned recently that Protestant colleges--as a result of the national emergency--face the most critical struggle for survival since the Civil War. He urged adoption of emergency financial measures by supporting churches to- keep the college going. Dr. Campbell is executive director of the 80-member Commission of the newly-formed National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U. S. A. His statements were in a speech before leaders of more than 30 Prot estant denominations at the first ses sion of the commission. Dr. Campbell pointed to dwindling college enrollments and resulting fi nancial losses because of the draft and defense jobs. But the biggest loss, he added, is in the morale of American youth of college age, ""who seem to have lost his grip on the fu ture."" "" None yet is on the verge of clos ing,"" Dr. Campbell said, "" but many Protestant-affiliated institutions, now- are wrestling with the problem of how they may stay open beyond next June. In surveying the present situation, Dr. Campbell said some liberal arts colleges with high academic standing even before the emergency were op erating with the worst deficits in their history. The immediate effect of the call for manpower, he asserted, has been to create an "" impossible situa tion."" A great number of students have withdrawn from college-- the men to enter the armed services as volunteers, the women to marry GI's or to take defense jobs, the speaker said, adding: "" But the biggest loss is not in en rollment but what has happened to the morale of American youth of col lege age. The 1951 undergraduate seems to have lost his grip on the future. He is concerned only with what may happen to him today."" "" The loss in morale is understand able and tragic. Can anyone but the church say anything to these young people that will restore their spirit? The Christian church is built on the life of a man who died on the cross."""

MEN'S COUNCIL MEETS;,
STRIVES TO BECOME A,
REPRESENTATIVE VOICE,"The Men's Council, meeting Jor the first time this semester, today urged the male students of Bucknell to pass on to them any gripes, problems, or ideas which may arise during the term. Seeking to make the Council a more representative voice of the campus, the organization passed this resolu tion along with action on such prob lems as school spirit, the obtaining of Carnegie Library for a student union, improvement of the general tone of dormitory life, and the possibility of an honor system. Stump Campbell, president of the group, said, ""This group is capable of doing much towards furthering the interests of the male student body. There are many students who prob ably have legitimate gripes or con structive ideas. They should be di verted to channels where action is possible."" The Men's Council is composed of the leaders of the various men's or ganizations on campus and is design ed primarily to meet the needs of the male student body.

EVENTS,"Every editor has an old, rather worn, but always timely issue he can pull out of the fire when the deadline approaches and yawning holes remain unfilled on the editorial pages. For semes ters on end the ""ace-in-the-hole"" of Bucknellian editors has been the topic of SC H O O L SPIR IT. The reams of editorial copy written on this subject if placed end to end would probably reach from Davis Gym to Memorial Stadium. The spirit they create probably never reaches the inside of these athletic arenas. Recently there has been ample and just cause to wonder why there should be a revival of school spirit. The disorganized mayhem called basketball that has taken place in Davis Gym this season makes one wonder why Bucknellians should stretch their vocal chords to the breaking point over such pathetic exhibitions. Must the few cheers offered be puhctuated by the sound of crack ing skulls, sights of men hurtling through the air and smashing impacts on the floor Contact is bound to occur in basketball but there is a point beyond which the element of accidental contact cannot be accept ed. Roughhouse tactics have been a consistent part of the games in Davis Gym this season. Some of it can be blamed on the visi tors and much of it on the home team. Bison rooters aren't get ting any happier about the lack of sportsmanship exhibited by some members of the basketball team. All too often this season visiting stars such as George David son and Pete Carrill of Lafayette, Bob Mitchell of Rhode Island State, Bob O'Brien of Gettysburg and others, were subjected to unsportsmanlike action. A hip or a foot thrown at the right mo ment was responsible for many of the swan dives and back breaking falls taken by the visitors. Is the team so bad it must resort to these methods to win? Just one suggestion: If some of the time spent making pyro technic displays of anger, working up facial contortions to amuse referees and walking pleadingly arm around the neck of officials, was spent improving play, it is conceivable the game be won by skill. Maybe some of the fans don't cheer, and then again, maybe its because they paid to see basketball not a five-man scrimmage interjected with pitifully inadequate attempts at humor. This sort of action has no place on the basketball floor. It's about time the men on the court realize that they play an impor tant part in this thing we call SCHOOL S PIR IT. h. 1. s.

On The Hook,"In certain male circles it is known as the crank , the all night stand"" or ""what drives men to drink."" Actually, the house phone is a simple device. You give the handle a few turns and your arrival is supposedly shortly announced to your date. No one, as vet, has ever /figured out just why it doesn't work that way. Of this much you are certain-- the house phone rings . . . and goes on ringing as long as you have the strength to continue turning the crank. To reveal the various bottlenecks that arise in the inner sanctum of the sem-gems at that point, would be a violation of a sacred trust. Maybe we're deaf! W ho knows. This is my suggestion, however. The next time you call for a date at Hunt, find out where the "" lucky girl's"" room is located then heave a brick through her wndow with a note explain ing that the brick is to be followed by a charge of dynamite if she isn't down in the reception room in five minutes. Your initials should be on the note to avoid confusion,'of course. Don't count on any miracles, but at least this might work better than the house phone. -- m- j- r-"

In fact we deserved to lose, because many of the dastardly acts committed by cer tain members of the team are not. re corded in the code of fair play. In the strict sense of the term these acts could be classified as ASSAULT"
AND BATTERY.,"Any player who attempts to win by shoving, pushing, poking, elbowing, and gouging deserves no considera tion as a player nor as a man. To the sport of basketball it is a display of gross misconduct; to our school it is an act of treason. Ability does not permit justification for acts such as these, nor are they justified com pensation for INFERIORITY. Consider, if you will, what these ciavenness enactments are doing to the prestige of our school. If you weigh the evidence truthfully then you have no other recourse but to I admit that fairplay is not being ex- I hibited. Frankly I doubt if it is even being considered. However we, the students, are par tially to blame. OUR lack of objec tion to this method of play denotes our approval. Also our approval is signified by fits of mirthful hysteria when an opponent is checked by a neat but well-placed ""cross-body block"". To you I say "" shame"". Let us make amends. Resolve that you shall no longer deem right' this mass j exposure to violence. Sincerely yours, An exponent of fairplay Chet Leach nell has a good team although we haven't won all our games. I'll stick by our team under any conditions except that of ""dirty play ing"". Unfortunately we have a few players on our team who feast upon this type of strategy. Those few have won Bucknell the name of ""dirty players."" It is discouraging to the spectators to watch this performance. I wish Our coach would do something about it. This might be one way of obtaining more true Bucknell followers. Afaithful follower, Blaine S. Purnell To The Editor: Sir: I like to watch good basketball."
I,"like to see "" my"" team play and play hard. I also like to win, but above all I like good sportsmanship. Buck- To The Editor: Were you disappointed with Fresh man Hazing this year? We were. As loyal Bucknellians we were sorry to see the spirit drop between classes. As upperclassmen we have experienc ed both sides of hazing, and enjoyed being a lowly Freshman. We realize hazing has been carried to extremes in some cases, but this year even pretending to haze the Frosh was a farce. We would like some power behind our rules instead of a social pressure committee. No one objects to singing a school song in a group or squaring that dink. But this year all our ways of enforce ment were abolished, therefore no Frosh were seen singing the Alma Mater, etc. A  spirit was missing--which was quite apparent by the attendance of three Frosh at the traditional Fresh man-Sophomore contests. We hesi tate to make any desired moves with out finding true student opinion. This Friday, slips will be passed out to the' entire student body, on which you may express your opinions pro or con. Half an interest will not help, we need total student cooperation. Hazing Committee of S. F. C. Editor's Note: Yeah! OSXXXXXXXSSXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXV i /"

Frosh Cagers Take First Loss,"by Paul Ganz Bill Lane's bid for a modem fresh man winning streak was rudely over ruled by the Penn State Frosh when they soundly drubbed the Baby Bisons 55-39 last Wednesday at State College. The Frosh were striving for their eighth straight decision but at the thirty mark, walked from the huge State court with their first loss of the season. The Jr. Herd had no trouble solving the zone defense set up by the Staters, and, with little Jeff Mynott leading the way, jumped to a lead which they held until one minute before the half. At the fifty-five second mark State, led by Bob Sherry, a new addition to the team, poured six points through the hoop to go out in front 24-23. Outranged The Lion cubs controlled the re bounds during the second half, a feat which dealt the death blow to the Bison, as they fielded a team ranging from six-two to six-five. They also switched from their conventional zone defense to a shifting mdn-for-man. It was during the third period that the Staters began to pull away and by the outset of the concluding quarter !had garnered a nine point spread. The final period marked the end for the Jr. Herd as State built up their .lead and left the Bison battling only the clock. Jim Poff, who led the same Bison [quintet to a 51-31 win over a slightly altered State Frosh earlier in the year, wa s constantly double-teamed by the towering Lions and dropped below his twenty point average as he racked up eleven points for the night. Captain Jeff Mynott took high honors for the Orange and Blue youngsters with 12 points. There will be no dull moments dur ing the 13th annual meet of the Middle Atlantic Collegiate Wrestling Association at,, Davis Gym, March 2 and 3. The Middle Atlantic Association de cision to_ stage bouts simultaneously on two mats assures unusual action for the opening sessions Friday night and Saturday afternoon. Individual and team championships will be de cided in the tournament finals, Sat urday night. Big Entry With 64 wrestlers scheduled to com pete in the tourney, Middle Atlantic officials sanctioned the dual-mat plan because of the large entry. The two- day eliminations call for a total of 80 bouts, including 56 in the champion ship flight and 24 for consolation points. Gettysburg College will defend the Middle Atlantic honors for the second year in a row. The contenders will be Bucknell, Delaware, Haverford, Lafayette, Muhlenberg, Swarthmore, and Ursinus. Bullets Tough Coach Ciydd;'Cole's ' squad proved 'this past weekend that it is again the team to beat. The Gettysburg wrest lers turned in a convincing, victory, 22 to 8, over Bucknell's highly rated squad that was unbeaten in four en counters with Middle Atlantic foes. Gettysburg is undefeated in three Middle Atlantic starts. Two of the five champions who -will defend division titles are Gettysburg men. They are John Loose, 121- pounder, and Jim Woods, 130-pound champ. by Jack Gamble The Herd has once more hit its stride! This week, for the first time since way-back in mid-December, the cagers have climbed* the scoring ladder to post numbers on the board that have seldom been seen. Witness Satur day's loss to G-burg in the eighties and last evening's whitewash o f Franklin and Marshall 95-77. Race With The Clock The Diplomats dropped a few quick points in the first four minutes to take a lead but the Herd thought it might be too much for the shoulders of the Diplomats, so relieved them of it. The Blue and White never had a chance after that. Jack Guy used a slightly altered starting five due to injuries of Bucky Strassner and Jackie Webber. This was probably one of the best contests of the current stand from the angle of the players. It was not the fast est, it was not the best played, nor was it the cleanest played but it of fered an opportunity for fans to see every member of the squad in action and judge the team as a complete unit. Some of the reserves were a bit nervous but we must tip our hats to them,, for it was a consistently shifted team in the Orange and Blue and one that operated well under all fire. Scorers Fell Behind Too! The fast break turned a bit too .*speedy in parts of the tilt and caused .a few balls to be given away and a I few easy shots to be missed. F & M  center, Walt Lenz, eighth highest scorer in small college court # circles, stayed right with his 22.41 average as he hit on eight field goals and six foul shots to lead the Diplo-1 mats in the scorebook with 22 points. Four men hit the double column for the Herd. They were Strella with 16, McKibbin with 11, DeLoca for 14 and Joe Gallagher topped the night with 23 markers. In the prelim the Baby Bisons drop ped their second tilt of the season to the F & M  juniors 54-41."
Gettysburg Edges Bisons,
In High-Scoring Contest;,
Two Scoring Records Fall,"Two more scoring records fell by champ almost loses' by Bill Fullmer The Gettysburg Bullets, employing their heavy artillery, riddled the lu( less Bison Matmen, 22-6, last Saturday night, before a near capacity crowd Davis Gymnasium. The evening's program said nothing0 ------------------------------------------------------- about the Battle of Gettysburg"", but the wayG-Burg Bullets were flying around, and a glance at the Bucknell casualty list, leaves one in doubt as to the program's veracity. Karl Mil ler and Robbie Robinson were the only Maackmen to survive'the G-burg bar rage which disabled Chuck Mercer and toppled Nelson Woolcock from the ranks o f the undefeated. In the 147 lb. bout, Karl Miller was nicked for only one point as he took the zip out of his Bullet, Byron W ag ner, 6-1. Permitting Wagner a single escape in the second period, Karl countered in the first and second periods with takedowns, and in the third with a reverse, to give Bucknell its first tally. Robbie Breezes In Robbie Robbinson was never touch ed by Fred Hoenninger. Scoring a takedown in the first period, a reverse in the second, and with full riding time in the third, Robbie left a thor oughly expended Bullet on the field of the 157 lb. skirmish. The Maackmen suffered their most disasteroous setback in the 167 lb. bout. Chuck Mercer, wrestling Get tysburg's Al Hershberger (undefeated in collegiate competition), sustained a badly sprained left elbow. As a re sult, Chuck will be lost to the team for an indefinite period. First Loss Moving into the third period o f his 177 lb. go, Nelson Woolcock needed a pin to win over G-burg's Jim Spang- ler. With only three seconds match time remaining, Nels threw caution to the winds in an attempt to score a win, and rolled into a half-nelson and crotch pin. This was Nelson's first defeat of the season. At 130 lbs., Bart Capellini dropped a close decision to the Bullet Middle Atlantic Champion, Jim Woods. He combined two reverses and an escape to nullify Bart's reverse and take down, 5-4. 123 lbs.: D. Woods (G) decisioned Goulding (B ) 2-0; 130 lbs.: J.

"THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA'",
PAGE FIVE,"The vote for by Harry Staley the most decisive knockout punch of the week goes not to Sugar Ray Robinson, new middleweight champ, but to seven men. Seven men who have helped destroy the very thing they were so "" admirably"" building. In seven days these men who accepted money to throw games have been re sponsible for shaking the very foundation of America's greatest spectator sport. Their lack of character will undoubtedly subject basketball to a long siege of court action, bad newspaper publicity and unfavorable fan reaction. Madison Square Garden, considered the mecca of the cage sport may also go down in history as the nemesis of the sport. The mixture of commercial sports sponsorship and amateur athletics, which has been partially responsible for creating interest in the game, has succumbed to the powerful and wealthy gambling syndicates. All of which makes the boys who cried "" Beware the evils of big-time athletics""  look pretty good. Thus far only New York City ballplayers have been involved in this scan dal. However, few people can be so naive as to rule out the probability that the same conditions exist in other big cities. In lieu of these existing condi tions amateur basketball is faced with the possibility of being forced to with draw from the more lucrative, big-time sports palaces to the protection of the cbllege campus, where there may be fewer bad influences but less income ac companying. All of which brings to mind a suggestion made recently by Dr. "" Phog"" Allen, coach at the University of Kansas. Dr. Allen proposes a basketball commissioner, similar to the late baseball commissioner Judge Landis. One of the duties of the court czar would be to investigate and discontinue the game where there is evidence of gambling control. Gambling has been wide-open in New York and a responsible commissioner might have been able to put the quietus on the gamblers before the present trouble blossomed forth. It s too late now to bemoan the fact that college athletes can be bribed, but the colleges and universities had better act fast if they want to save the sport. IDLE CHATTER .. . Word has it that Art Rayner, Bison soccer and base ball mainstay last season, is now in the paratroops . . .  In F & M center Lenz, Bison basketball fans viewed the eighth highest scorer in small college court circles . . . The Diplomats court star has connected for 58 field goals and SS3 foul shots in 8 games for a game average of 22.4 . . . Several basketball experts stated that in the recent Pitt-Bradley basket ball game the Braves were considerably puzzled by the tight Pitt zone defense in the first half of the ball game . . . Closer observation reveals that the Braves scored 43 points in the first half . . . How mystified can you be?"

MIRiS,"by Paul Ganz "" We've got a better schedule than last year, but we'Ve also got a better team since the addition of Paul Rem- mey,"" so saith Hank Peters, colorful tennis mentor. Remmey was a mem ber of the Middle District Junior Davis Cup Team and has graduated from the freshman squad. Remmey isn't the only one Peters bases his opinion upon. There is also an impressive array of returning vet erans. Nick Schloeder, whose 14-3 record was the best of the year, leads this list. Capt. Grey Rodgers, a su perior netman whose senior status makes this his.last season of collegiate competition, along with Bill Reitz and Jim Hess round out this crop of re turning racketmen. Maurice Muffson and Alan Goff, up from the Frosh, will be counted upon heavily. The team has been practicing in doors since their return from the Christmas holidays and Coach Peters figures they should be ready for their opening swing below the Mason-Dixon line. March 29th through the 31st will find the racketeers visiting the U. of Maryland, George Washington U. and Naval Academy. The biggest headache for the Bison netmen will again be Cornell Univer sity, whose 1950 tennis team was the best in the East, and according to pre-season dopesters, the Big Red from Ithaca will appear even bigger to anyone who threatens removal of the Eastern Intercollegiate Tennis Cup which graces their trophy case. Despite Cornell and several other prominent racket names, the Herd ap pears a sure bet to improve last years 7-7 record. The schedule: Mar. 29--Geo. Washington ............."

O,"----------- -- -------------------------------------------- Saturday evening the Bisons will be the second night feature of the Winter Carnival weekend at Colgate Univer sity. On the previous night the Red Raiders will entertain Penn State in a tilt that might put the statisticians minds at ease. There will be a considerable num ber of Bucknell migrators on hand to see the hardwood battle that has the Herd rated up with the best of them, from the standpoint of the price of ducats. Tickets are $1.80 for top games in the Raider campas against $1.20 for lesser contests. Captain Ted Stacy "" . . . Raider Threat The Hamiltonians, currently being considered for the NIT, have been having a rough time getting back to their early season form. A two week lay-off from competition between se mesters seriously handicapped the Raider quintet. Coach Howie Hart man has really had his work cut out in bringing the squad back up to the pitch it had reached for the Dixie Tournament in which the Raiders took second place honors."

?Manchester,"In recent games the most apparent reason for the sudden change for the worse has been in the drop in field goal shooting percentage. Against the Cadets at West Point they hit for 31 percent and against Buffalo drop ped 31 of 91 shots. In recent games against Holy Cross and Syracuse the Redmen have upped their averages considerably. It is believed they will be back on top by the time the Herd hits campus. Plenty Of Depth Along with ten lettermen, sopho more Bill Dodd has added his 6' 4"" frame to those o f 6' 5"" Dave Alton and 6' 5"" Gene Cremins to give the Raiders good height on the squad. Dick Osborn's 6' 3"", 200-pound body gives the squad even more help under the. boards. Along with height, the Raiders have good scoring punch in forwards Dave Alton and 5' 10"" Joe Stratton. The most valuable bit add ed to the team is the field generalship of Capt. Ted Stacy. Stacy has made quite a name for himself around the Ivy league as one of the best all- around floormen of the game today. The. tilt will provide plenty of colorful basketball for fans who will flock to upstate New York for this big week end on the Raider campus. The team will be welcomed to Ro chester by the local alumni club who will attend the game as a group and entertain the squad at a reception in the Faculty Lounge of the university. The parents of all BU students from that area have been invited and will be shown movies of last fall's football games. P lease! The perfect way to top off that eve ning will be for the Herd to cop the cage battle with U of R at the River Campus Palsstra. Coach Lou Alex ander's scrappy quintet has knocked off nine opponents to date while suc cumbing to six. This will be the next to last contest for the Yellowjackets and they will be aiming to put the figures on the left side of the column in the double-numbers bracket. Tomorrow night's Palestra battle will find the Jackets in top form, with four of the leading scorers past the ICO mark in the seasons play. Cap tain Lou Alexander Jr. leads with 186 points, an average of 15.6 per, followed by Center John Donohue who has netted 170. The big jumper's recent scoring splurge was capped when he poured through 36 points against Allegheny College. Bob Place E j has dropped in 126, while the diminu tive Bill Secor is fourth with 104 tal lies. Trailing the top men in pointage is the up-and-coming youngster, Arne Ciaccio, who has hit the scoring col umn of late and has a total of 99 points to his credit."

Receptionist Plays Varied Roles,
As Go-Between In College Dating,"by Pete Tasch Combining the best qualities of a diplomat, mind reader, fortune teller, and errand runner, the girl on desk duty in the women's dormitories has to be a paragon of tact and patience. >> Typical among these behind?the-O among desk girls is Lu Pinner, who, after three years of wholesale baby sitting, knows more about more people--and still keeps it to herself. Lu applied for the job through stu dent aid. Like the more than sixty other girls, she spends several hours each week,'starting anytime after 8:00 in the morning on week days, and 9:00 on Sundays, until 11:00 at night, helping the boys find the girls, and, occasionally, the girls find the boys. On blind dates, Lu serves as the go- between, as the boys query her about the girls, and the girls do the same about the boys. Many times, she has pointed the two out to' each other. Perhaps one of her trickiest duties is to remember messages, and see that when she tells ""Jack"" that his date is somewhere else, he is really ""Jack"". Usually, by a process of elimination, she can tell which boy belongs to whom. Then too, Lu is invaluable to the girl who wants to be dressed as well as the boy. The unsuspecting male is mentally tabulated and a full des cription is hurried to the girl who doesn't know which dress to wear. There are several categories into which the visiting beaux fall. Num ber one, iyr instance, waits in the re ception hall for ten minutes, reading the paper, or chatting; and then cas ually announces himself. Number two can never decide which name goes with which bell--this often leads to complications when he rings his old flame by mistake. Then, there is the type who trys to ring the bell without anybody know ing who his date is. This shy guy tan't win, for Lu either knows him from the description received from his date, or will see her when the two leave. Another cheery fellow is the one who rings all the bells with reck less abandon. Among the duties performed by Lu and the others are answering the phone calls and delivering those mes sages and special delivery packages that often come. And always, the biggest package goes to the highest floor. This job is ideal to the student of human nature, for every conceivable type, sooner or later, visits the girls' dormitories. To Lu, it's a lot of' fun."

Campus Quizzer,
Should Frosh Gals Be Pinned?,"by Elaine Vouyoukas A surprising number of freshman girls have been sporting the pins of various fraternities on campus, so I thought a timely question would be: ""Do you think it s advisable for girls to be pinned in their first year of college?"" I first asked the opinions of a few*- ----------------------------------------------- members of a fraternity known to take their pinning seriously, the K. D. R.'s. The house and its members were turned into a pandamonium, or should I say a small uproar for the less erudite, when the question was asked. Needless to say, for the first ten min utes nothing could be understood but a jarble of words. However, after that the words came thick and fast. Pete Peterson, John Walker, and Dick Shultz were all for the idea. Dick, however, elaborated on the idea and gave a paradoxical statement that, nevertheless, is far too true in many cases. Dick said, ""Yes, girls of 18 are of age--they should know what they're doin', but they don't!"" Well it seems that not only applys to 18 year olds, but women of all ages unfortunately! Charlie Cooper, also a KDR at tempted to drown out his brothers with NO, NO, NO! When he calmed down to a roar, I asked him what were his reasons. He finally consented to end the is sue by just saying that: ""They're too young to know what they're doin'."" I gather from the statements of the K. D. R.'s that women never know what they're doing! Well now, I wouldn't say that! I decided the female viewpoint had better enter into the discussion fast before I got myself into a hopeless muddle. So I asked Sue Owens her opinion from the feminine angle. There was no hesitation in Sue's mind as she replied: ""Definitely not, I think a fraternity pin at Bucknell should mean a lot. Therefore it would involve serious consideration of both parties."" Well done, thou good and faithful servant! But we have some differ ences of opinion on that first state ment from the Lambda Chi's. Kenny Roberts, a Lambda Chi, says: ""Well, a pin at Bucknell doesn't usually mean that much anyway, un less an understanding has been reach ed. In such cases, a pin is considered an engagement. Otherwise, it's a ""going steady"" pin."
I,"guess it wouldn't be to bad, in most cases, for a freshman girl to be pinned."" Jack Tress, a T. K. E.,, is of the opinion that there'd have to be little strings attached to the pinning. He agreed that: ""It would have to depend on how much they liked the guy--there's have to be conditions attached. Oh yes--with favorable conditions."" Details, details! I then asked the opinion of one of a very happy-couple who are pinned. Lonny Cupp, a DZ pledge, gave an agreeable answer, I'm sure, to all the supporters of this cause. She said: ""I definitely don't see anything the matter with it. You would have to have a mutual under standing as to what the pin symbol izes."" Subscribe for the Bucknellian"

The Mike (,"by Jim Hastings When I walked past the studio of WVBU, the suction from buzzing con fusion whisked me within the halls of 'bitter end.' When the chair flew by my head' and the rug slipped from under my feet, it didn't take long to draw but on conclusion--cleaning up! (It might as well be spring?) Then in an official tone of voice a member of the Board of Directors said, ""Hastings, we're renovating this here place for the new ultra-modem B & B 5Plan. No, the initials don't stand for a complex mathematical formula, or a contagious disease, but just for 'bigger and better' plans for the future. Besides a physical cleanup, your ob server noticed 'anxious executives' awaiting to perform their official duties in various capacities. (There go those Q. C.'s again this semes ter. Optomist's attitude--who's go ing to graduate in these times, any ways). Among these new executives is Ruth Castner, secretary. If by chance you're tired of hearing old records repeated time and again, we have two late bulletins for your interest. Some of these records have disappeared, while eighty newly pur chased discs will make their debut currently, ranging in tempo from Ralph Flanagan's ""Goodbye and Good- riddance"" to Ray Anthony's ""Busting Out At Bucknell"". Now you haven't an excuse for not turning on that radio! What, roommate doesn't study well with radio playing--solution-- get rid of roommate. In a more serious vein. That's pos sible, we hear a plea for new announc ers. I overheard John Manbeck, chief staff announcer, asking for new re cruits, MEN ONLY, but wait a min ute girls! The four major networks (ABC -- Always Back Campaigns, NBC -- Never Rates Camouflage, M'BS--Mari's Behavior Sacrificed, and CBS--Campus Beauties Sacred) have mentioned that female voices are not suited for regular announcing. But don't be discouraged, for if your in anyway talented, by all means elim inate that 'housewife hardness' by finding yourself a spot on a specialty show. READ The Bucknellian."

Miami Campus Has No Glamour,
For Visiting Bucknell Students,"by Bobbie Maurer ""Wouldn't it be just wonderful to transfer to the University of Miami?"" is an exclamation quite frequently made by Bucknellians and students every where. Pedhaps it would be wonderful, but let's take a look at the university and see. 0 While spending our mid-semester vacation in Florida, Pat Lewis arid I decided to look around this school about which we'd heard so much. We set out with the intention of looking up Jackie Smith, the skilled little twirler from Bucknell, who acquired a scholarship to the University of Miami last year. College Town The picturesque Floridian town of Coral Gables is perhaps one of the nicest college tQwns in the United States. The main street is clean and white, lined with good modern stores, movies, and the like. The college is situated at one end of the town, just past Doctor's Hospital. The first im posing building that met our eyes was the Merrick Building. It is a long white structure gf modern architec ture, having archways and unenclosed halls. Huge windows frame the li brary in this building. ""Continuing on, we came to a large group of buildings that gave one the impression of barracks enclosed by a fence. We found the office of women here, for these were the girl's dormi tories, and upon asking for Jackie Smith, a girl popped up exclaiming she was her roommate. After pro curing passes, we followed her to her dorm. Jackie was very surprised at seeing us, and happily showed us around the campus. No Honor System The girl's dorms are very nice in side. They are divided in sections, each having a livingroom, kitchenette, and a few rooms, all modern. While the rooms are nice, the regulations are not. You see, they have no honor system there, and the girls are requir ed to sign in and out at all times. In addition, they must meet and leave their dates at the outside gate, which sometimes necessitates walking sev eral blocks alone when returning home. No men are allowed inside the gates, except with special permis sion. I hope I'm not dulling any of your hopes. We saw two more beautiful build ings at the university. One was a class building, all ultra-modern, with outside halls and stairways. The other caused us to gasp, as most as suredly you would do if you saw the ""Chet's"" of the University of Miami. It is a huge building, containing mod ern lounges, a large cafeteria, a snack room and counter, and outdoor pavil ions and walks. Easy Livin' Huge windows take up most of the wall space, giving a beautiful effect as one looks out onto tropical plants, palm trees, and the small lake running beneath some of the walks. Everyone eats at the cafeteria, since meals are not included in the college bill. They have an orchestra for three evening meals a week, and have dancing on the outside pavilion during nice weather. Chairs and tables are placed along bridge-like strips over the water, giving a pleasant atmosphere. Needless to say, because of the size of the school, one can walk into the student union and not see a soul he knows. The friendly atmosphere found in small colleges like Bucknell is en tirely lost. Aside from the modern buildings I have mentioned, I could see nothing more to the campus. The land is per fectly flat and gives no impression of being a campus. Everything is so spread out, the students are usually away from their rooms from breakfast to supper. The remainder of the (Continued on page 8.) - iy ScA /#. by Herb Schloo"

Crutches - Popular Campus Fad,
As Many Students Suffer Falls,"by Helen Redfield Crutches seem to be a fad of the Bucknell campus. Everywhere you go, you are likely to meet a student who ""just fell"". Accounts of how they fell are varied and amusing. The following is a cross-section of typical victims. We hope no students will feel left out in this account, but a complete list of accident cases was unavailable. Three of the victims were gathered for the above picture and comments poured from them like Bucknell rain. Collision In Ha rris Shirley O'Grady fell in Harris Hall. Her roommate had just received an important phone call and came dash ing down the hall. At the same time, Shirley darted out of her room. The two girls collided and fell with Shir ley on the bottom. Consequently, Shirley received a severe cut oh her forehead and a broken ankle. Shirley's ankle was put in a cast a week after the accident. She stated that she had more pain before the cast was put on than afterward. When asked how she felt about the whole thing, she said, ""wonderful, for getting seats on the bus and is a perfect weather indicator. She also stated that ""people have been wonder ful to me"". Anne Sheffer was jumping for a #""jump ball"" in basketball and as she"

Soon, however, it was discovered that she had fractured a bone in her foot. Shirley was sitting in the same room, listening and laughing, as Abe.,was suffering from the same plight. ' Anne was out of her cast last Tues day but will have to wear crutches for four more weeks. She commented that people should be more careful when they play' bas ketball. She grinned, however and remarked, ""You meet more people.am} certainly get a lot of attention."" SJnow Slides Joe Whipple went skiing for the first time this season in Stowe, Ver mont. He didn't get further than the first 100 yards. At that time, he tried to make a turn, hit a patch of ice and ""just fell"". He got up and tried to ski but couldn't as he had no control of his foot. So he walked down the hill to a doctor. He discovered that he had chipped a bone in his foot and would be in a cast for some time and then crutches would follow. His doctor obligingly autographed his cast with ""Best Wishes from Stowe, Vermont!"" Joe told the group that it hurts more now than it did at the time of the accident. He also described the wonderful time and the wonderful service he received at the Phi Gam houses at Lehigh and Lafayette-- ""Had more fun after the accident than before.""

Vie For Prom Queen Title,
Mid-Atlantic Tournament,
Features Mat Champions,"by Harry Staley, Sports Editor The best wrestling talent in the Middle Atlantic Collegiate Wrestling As sociation will be on display at Davis Gym this weekend when the annual tour nament is held. Five division champions will be on hand to defend their titles before an imposing array 'of contenders. Big Field A field of 64 entrants representing Gettysburg, Ursinus, Delaware, Hav- erford, Swarthmore, Lafayette, Muh lenberg and Bucknell will compete for the championship. Gettysburg will be attempting to protect the crown they won last season. A busy program of 80 bouts will face the contestants and in order to speed up the eliminations, bouts will be run simultaneously on two mats in the opening sessions Friday evening and Saturday afternoon. The finals on Saturday evening will be on one mat. When the quarter-finals open Fri day night at 8 o'clock, the first champ to experience the brand of competition will be John Loose of Gettysburg. Loose will defend his crown against such stalwarts as Harry Bair of Hav- erford, Mike Laws of Swarthmore and Marshall Goulding of Bucknell. Champs Threatened Jim Woods, Gettysburg 130 pounder can look upon Don Rumer of Dela ware and John DeLissio of Muhlen berg as major threats to his title. The 137 pound title is waiting for a new man with Jack Leidy of Gettysburg, Bill Rice of Muhlenberg and Roy Cun ningham of Bucknell likely champs. It will be a field of seven contenders versus Gov Cadwallader, Haverford star, in the 147 pound class. Cadwal- lader's hopes for a second champion ship could be shattered by unbeaten Bob Downing of Lafayette or Buck- nell's new find, Karl Miller. The scrap for the 157 pound laurels is-wide open with Ken Ruhl, Swarth more captain; Bill Downing, twin brother of the Lafayette 147 pounder; and Belber Robinson of Bucknell fighting for the top position. George Sehmauch, defending champion of Muhlenberg, will defend his 167 pound title against A1 Hershberger of Get tysburg and Ned Hollingsworth of Haveford. 177 Class Open There will be no one around to de fend the 177 pound title but action will be fast and furious. Leading contenders appear to be Bucknell's Nelson Woolcock, Gettysburg's Jim Spangler, Muhlenberg's Bob Miller and Delaware's Jim Michael.

HILDRETH ADDRESSES,
CHURCH CONGREGATION,"Last Sunday, the Beaver Memorial Methodist Church held its annual lay man's service, with Dr. Horace A. Hildreth delivering a few remarks on ""Reporting for Duty"". Also assisting in conducting the service were: Mrs. Fred Wilson, layleader, Mrs. S. T. Deibert, Dr. John W. Rice, and Mr. Robert Webster. Dr. Hildreth emphasized that a good Christian not only attends services, but contributes willingly to church activities. He further stated that integrity of character was of more value to the individual than being popular with the group. Dr. Hildreth denounced emphatical ly the three athletes at City College who had accepted a bribe to throw a basketball game. ""It is unbelievable"", he stated, ""that a student body would ask that these boys be allowed to continue the term when they had lit erally sold their team down the river."
Student Committee Investigates,
Academic Honor System For BU,"A committee composed of interested students has recently been formed to study the possibilities of establishing an academic honor system at Bucknell, it was learned this week. Four committees who work in con-0 ---------"
-----,
-,"- junction with the central committee have been set up. These committees are the Publicity Committee, a Stu dent Relations Committee, a Student- Faculty Relationships Committee, and a Student-Administration Relations Committee. The Publicity Committee has set as its purpose the acquainting of the students and faculty with all the ad vantages of having such a system here. Questionnaires have been sent to other colleges which have a scho lastic honor system. The results of these questionnaires will be published in the Bucknellian, so that the students can see the vari ous methods of organizing such a system and also the reactions of stu dents who live under this system. Will Sample The Student Relations Committee has planned to approach students from all walks of campus life to sample their opinions. In addition, a preliminary questionnaire has been submitted to faculty members in which they can present their opin ions. In personal conferences, the Stu dent-Faculty Committee has also sought the suggestions of faculty members who have agreed to support the system if the students express their desire to have it. The administration has also been interviewed as to their reactions to establishing the system. The reac tions of the students, faculty, and ad ministration will be published in the Bucknellian in future issues. Forum Planned The committee has planned to have a forum after all facts have been pre sented to the student body. At this forum the committee invites all stu dents who have any reaction, whether favorable or unfavorable, to partici pate in the discussion. >> This is a student project. The committee is endeavoring to investi gate the possibilities of organizing an academic honor system here. If you wish to offer your services, please send a note to the Scholastic Honor System Committee, W156."

'Vagabond' Bergin And Band Brings,
Down House At 1932 College Prom,"by Helen Redfield ""Soft lights and music"" were not unheard of on Bucknell's campus twen ty years ago. At this time of the year when The F. D. R. era was just begin ning, the prom held at the women's dining hall was the chief center of attrac tion on Bucknells campus. On Friday, February 26, 1932, the0' Juniors presented the Junior Prom in the Women's Dining Hall featuring Freddie Bergin and his Vagabonds. Freddie Bergin was ""one of Ameri ca's finest bands"" and had also been booked by such colleges as Cornel!, Lafayette, Michigan, Ohio, Pitt, and Purdue. At the time, he had just re turned from a ""censational engage ment at the famous Roseland Ball room in New York City. Shoot The Fifty One feature of the '32 Prom was favors in addition to the conventional programs. The favors were ""white leather cases with University seals on the front; on the inside of ""each favor was a cigarette case done in black on one side; gnd on the other was a small black purse"". (Sounds nice, huh?). Also on the social program was the play ""Trial of Mary Dugan"" held at the Union County Court House on Friday night at an hour preceding the prom. On Saturday night, nine of the fraternities held dances so that it was really ""a banner weekend of so cial functions"". Wheel But the biggest thrill of this week end was that the Student-Faculty council ruled that the Saturday dances could continue until 11:55 p. m: (Won der what the deadline was before this ?) Sounds like Bucknellians knew how to have a terrific time as far back as twenty years ago."
"Alpha Chi's Elect Rice, Wightman","Mary Ann Rice was elected presi dent of Alpha Chi Omega last Tues day evening at the regular meeting. Jacqueline Wightman was chosen vice president and Suzanna Snyder was selected pledge mother. Dollie Dietrich, Barbara Ingram, and Charlotte Weber were elected sec retaries, and Betsy Conklin is the new treasurer. Lee Craig was chosen social chairman, and Cecelia Brooks and Mollie Brown are in charge of rushing."

T H E  B U C K N E L L I A N,"by Mac Maccubbin Last Saturday noon a group of University trustees, faculty members, students, President Horace A. Hildreth, and other notables, wound their way across the wooden planks leading to the front entrance of Buckneli's latest edifice, the Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library, to take part in and observe the lay ing of the new building's cornerstone. The preliminary ceremonies took0 ' place in the main room of the rapidly rising structure. Although the long room was cold and damp with the smell of new concrete in the air, the gathering looked about the building with admiration and anticipation. Even the great gray slabs, which now divide the interior into a maze of rooms, seemed to display fulfillment of many a Bucknellian's dreams. Invocation Given The ceremonies began as the crowd of an estimated 100 formed a semi circle about one end of the room. Dr. Norman Stewart, chairman of the li brary committee of the university fac ulty and professor of zoology, gave the invocation. Dr. Mary Wolfe, chairman of the building and grounds committee of the board of trustees, told of Bucknell's libraries of the past. In 1896, the second floor of Old Main, with a science annex in the Chemistry Building, seemed adequate; 1905 saw the completion of the pres ent Carnegie Library; today, with the number of students and courses great ly increased, a new library is necessi tated, Dr. Wolfe stated. Library Needed She went on to say that two of the most important buildings on any cam pus are a library for knowledge, and a chapel for spiritual outlook. "" Our students will have access to a rich store of knowledge,"" Dr. W olfe con cluded. Harold W. Hayden, librarian, announced that the new building will have a seating capacity for over 800, and its atmosphere will be conducive to studying. Jack Maeby, president of the Stu dent Faculty Congress, speaking on behalf of the student body said, "" This library is one more factor towards Bucknell's list of achievements."" ""The heurt of a university is in its library,"" stated President Horace A. Hildreth, as he accepted a copper box containing documents of historical in terest to the university and the com munity from Dr. Stewart. Contents Told The contents of the box include: The Centennial History of Bucknell University, Inauguration of Horace A. Hildreth, The Bucknell Alumnus, 1950- '51 University Catalogue, various Bucknell publications, survey and pic torial maps, wire recordings of the centennial commencement, schedules of athletic events, and group photo graphs of all present fraternities, sor- : orities, and BISA, with appended lists of members. The ceremonies were concluded with the pronouncement of the benediction by Dr. Charles M. Bond, professor of religion. The gathering followed President Hildreth to the brilliant sunlit front entrance, where the cop- 1 per box was sealed within the corner- ' stone for posterity. Dr. Robert Calhoun, professor of theology and philosophy at Yale Univer sity, will be the speaker at each of the four faculty meetings which will be held during Religion-In-Life Week, February 28 to March 4.

Morals Shmorals,"Dear Editor: At any university, no matter what the size, a student humor magazine must exist. Although I have been here only since February, I believe there is a definite need for a rebirth of The Squirl. The gap between the short feature story, the cartoon, and the occasional joke printed in The Bucknellian, and the humor in The Bucknell Engineer should be filled. A humor magazine would be a haven for fledging humor ists, short story writers, photograph ers, cartoonists,, and the like. HumOr in the college magazine doesn't have to be obscene to be funny --The Cornell Widow, and The Johns Hopkins Jaywalker are excellent ex amples of that. They get their ideas across without worrying about fed eral postal regulations. A humodr magazine would help strengthen school spirit, and at the same time, give the student journalist the experience, and outlet for his tal ents that he needs. Bring back The Squirl. Pete Tasch While leafing through the exchange papers recently for an editorial idea to filch, we came upon that good paper, the JUNIA- TIAN, whose editor it seems had been similarly occupied, his field of research being the new Sears and Roebuck catalogue. For there on the editorial page, in neatly spaced bold face, he expounded on the deteriorating morals of the present Ameri can generation as evidenced by the advertising of a new Sears and Roebuck doll house replete with a bar and the usual acces sories. This, he held, was characteristic of the pleasure seeking tendencies of most people today. W e had to disagree. A country that has taken the giant steps this one has in edu cation, science, and world leadership should be tolerated a few impish notions like putting bars in doll houses, we thought. Per haps this is tracable to that paradox of our culture which allows us to produce Dwight Eisenhower and men like the uniformed buffon, General Harry Vaughan, in the same generaton, or send *our armed forces halfway around the world to die while we kill off an equal number of the population right here in automobile accidents. Things of this sort, we think, are part of our culture. We don't mind them putting bars in doll houses. We like it. We hope they put in roulette wheels. To The Editor: Recently, I, as a poor unsuspecting student, walked cheerfully into, a cer tain office in Roberts Hall and asked if it would be possible to drop a course in one department and add a course in another department. My request was answered with a very blunt and terse NO! My excuse was not sufficient enough for me to drop the course! As I walked meekly out I began to wonder about this whole problem. It seems very strange to me that you are allowed to sign up for the courses o f your choice without any questions being' asked, but when you find, for some reason that you do not wish to take a course, you are sub ject to a third degree as to your rea sons for dropping it. If a student finds that he does not wish to take a course, why not let him drap and add as he wishes, as long as the new course is still open and he pays the required fee. If Bucknell is striving for better student relations, I believe this would be one way to help attain this aim. Also it would, help the student attain his goal of furthering his education. In my case I shall now be forced to sit through a whole semester of a course I do not wish to take, while if I had been able to change I would be able to take a course that would be o f interest and help to me. I do not write this letter with an attitude of beligerance, but only with"

$1000 For WSSF,
Given To Hildreth,
SILVER WHISTLE NOT,
SO SLiCK' SAYS POOR,
MAN'S FIRST NIGHTER,"A check for oh -3 thousand dollars was presented to President Hildreth by the World Student Service Fund Committee last week. This money is part of the $3,554 collected during the recent drive and will remain here on campus as a scholarship fund for foreign students. The remainder of the fund is al ready being sent to national WSSF for distribution to students in needy colleges all over the world. Ed Blick, chairman, announced yesterday that some of the pledges have not. yet been collected and urged all those who promised donations during the drive to get them to the solicitor or the CA office as soon as possible. President commend>>! the commit tee for their successful campaign, em phasizing the importance of continu ing the foreign student study program here. by Eon Raphael The playbill says it's a story about a dying dog who comes to life when he hears a silver whistle, and, osten sibly, the story is about some old 1 folks who start to live again with the appearance of a 77-year-old prevari cating tramp with said whistle. It was a little thing called, oddly enough, the "" Silver Whistle"", and it was presented by the Lewisburg Com munity Theatre Guild last Thursday and Friday night as their second of fering of the season. The play dealt with the prosaic life of the inmates of an old people's home, and the main objective of their lives-- waiting to die, and grumbling and groaning about imagined aches and pains. Then, lo and behold! A miracle! An old man with all kinds of magic, [youth restoring potion, magic whis tles wild stories, and such, comes to live at the home, with many interest ing results. As a whole, after getting off to a slow start, the play picked up towards the latter part of scene two, act two, and moved to a fast-paced climax. The story endeavored to point out that 'it's all in the mind', at least in the case of growing old. It was al most credible, but from a student viewpoint, it is terribly hard to con ceive what it feels like to be senile, looking forward to dying, and other cheerful things. The acting deserves commending, particularly in the ease (c)f Mr. F. L. Wood, as Mr. BEEBE. Mary John son was up to par, and one of our BU librarians, Mildred Bolleh, did a con vincing job as a drunken old maid. A few of the parts weren't as dy namic as they could, have been, but, again, as a whole, the acting was commendable. May we conclude by saying that if you like that kind of play, it was just the play for you, and you would have liked it, we're sure."

The Na tional Conference of Christians and Jews is the sponsor of the movement. Mr. Eric Johnston, chairman of Brotherhood Week, in an address to the nation last Sunday afternoon, re minded Americans that brotherhood should not be practiced for just a mere seven days, but at all times throughout the year. Mr. Johnston also brought out that brotherhood is not toleration of an other race, creed, color, or religion, but it is a deep belief in the state ment that all men are created equal-- that a person should not be judged because of material possessions, but rather for his individual worth as a fellow man. For world peace, for world freedom -- a crusade by all men against dis crimination, segregation, bias, preju dice, and slanderous talk is necessary,. Mr. Johnston concluded.

IMPORTANT INF,6
RMATION FOR SENIORS RELATIVE TO,
SELECTIVE SERVICE,"Seniors graduating may request from their local Draft Board a 30-day I waiver in which time to secure a position which will be of aid to the nation in its mobilization efforts. All seniors may not be eligible because the securing of such a position will depend largely on the course they pursued in college. For instance, a graduate in education would not be eligible unless he could secure a position teaching chemistry, biology, physics, etc. The local Draft Board then will have to decide if the position is essential or not If the position is not deemed essential, the senior graduating may then request another 30-day waiver in order to have the opportunity to enlist in the branch of service he desires. Juniors, sophomores, and freshmen are also eligible for this latter 30-day waiver.

"YES, WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE . .  .","The assistant dean of Pittsburgh University's medical school declared re cently, "" There is no quota system in use in the (Pitt) medical school."" This statement and others made by the dean on that occasion were labelled by the Pitt News as "" verbal gymnastics"" and "" circular talk."" The News said the dean offered no sound reason for the school's including racial and religious questions on the application; only that "" they have been in that form since 1909."" The dean went on to say that it is the duty of the medical school tosupply the wants of the community, and the community considers racial and religious backgrounds in selecting its physicians. "" If that is true,"" commented the News, "" then Pitt's medical school cer tainly should have quotas. Yet the good doctor says it has not."" Summing up, the News declared, ""Th$ quota system (may) not be down on paper so as to provide critics with proof positive.

"Bullets Edge Guymen In Close Overtime Battle, 96-91",
Gettysburg Sub Sinks Herd;,
"Strassner, Gallagher Star","In an almost carbon copy of their thrilling game of two weeks ago, the Gettysburg Bullets again squeezed out a narrow win in an overtime period over the Bison basketballers last night in Gettysburg, 96-91. o Battle Close From the beginning to its spine tingling finish the contest was a nip and-tuck battle which saw a substitute and an injury plagued player take top scoring honors. George Pizzalato, replacing the injured George Hare for Gettysburg, stole the scoring show as he dropped in a total of 36 points for the evening. Bucky Strassner, in a remarkable display of courage, led the Bisons with 30 points although every step on his pain-ridden legs was agony. Gettysburg started in a flash and sped to a first quarter lead of 26-19. The Bisons were having trouble stay ing with the Bullets until four min utes remaining in the half when a flurry of baskets brought them to within four points. However, Hank Belber stole the ball for an easy lay up and with seconds to go dropped in an amazing 75 foot set shot to send the Bullets in at halftime leading 44- 38. Joe Ties It The third quarter found the Bisons closing the gap and the score at the end of that period was Bucknell 58, Gettysburg 61. Early in the fourth period the Bisons momentarily over took the Bullets and from there on *out it was a basket-for-basket affair. With the Bullets leading 81-79 and a minute remaining in the game Gal lagher connected for his first field goal of the second half to tie the game. Gallagher then put on one of the finest exhibitions of clutch foul shoot ing seen in a long time when he drop ped in four consecutive foul shots, the last with four seconds remaining in the game, to send the game into a five minute overtime period. Bisons Falter For three of the five minutes in the overtime period the teams battled evenly but then the Bullets began to pull away. Joe Gallagher and Mc- Kibbin fouled out and the Bullets went on to win another thriller 96-91. ""One Extra Bullet"" Bucknell"

S H IR T S  &  T IE S,"UNDERWEAR * HANDKERCHIEFS * SPORTS SHIRTS The Red Devils of Dickinson Col lege will provide the opposition this Saturday evening when the Bison quintet turns invader. The Guymen have a strong incentive to defeat their hosts as they bowed to the Car lisle five twice last season. The picture looks a little brighter this year since Dickinson lost their last year's ace Wes Overholt. How ever, the Red Devils will be led by big Dick Zilling who scored 320 points as a sophomore last year. Joe Gallagher "" . . . approaches record"" Record Near The highlight of the game as far as the: Bisons are concerned will very likely be the eclipsing of the all-time Bucknell individual record by Joe Gallagher. Provided he maintains his present scoring pace, the sharp shooting, junior forward should pass the record of 366 points he established last season. Height will be on the side of the Herd for one of the few times this year since the Red Devils tallest player is six-feet three inches tall. However, Bill Stark, who averaged 23 points per game as a freshman, and Jerome Block who starred as a fresh man will provide plenty of speed in the Dickinson attack."
-BEAT DICKINSON-,"Easton, Pa. will be the scene of Bucknell's final away game next Wed nesday night when the Bison bas- keteers encounter a speedy Lafayette five, which already boast* one victory over the Guymen this season. In an attempt t(r) balance the ledger, Coach Jack Guy will stick to the same lineup that has consecutively beaten. F&M, Rochester and Colgate this past week. Davidson Returns The Bisons will have to be at their best to earn a triumph over the Leop ards, since the host club' will he giv ing its all for Coach Ray Stanley who retires at the end off the current cam paign. This season. Lafayette has taken eleven out of twenty games, in cluding a 61-46 win over Bucknell."
A,visit to Madison Square Garden last week saw Lafayette come out on the short end of a 67-48 game with C. C.
N. Y.,"It should be noted that the Leopards were severly handicapped in the City College meeting by the ab sence of George Davidson>>, who was hospitalized by an attack of the flu. Davidson, who is listed among the ten top scorers in the nation with a twenty point average, has recovered completely from his ailment, and will be at full strength for next week's tilt. Gil Shor, averaging fifteen points per game, and diminutive Pete Carrill are two other obstacles the Bisons must hurdle if they are to come home with a win under their belts. A Philadelphia sports column ist tabbed the five feet-seven inch Car rill as the "" best little man""  in. college basketball, after he turned in a bril liant performance against LaSalle College in the Quaker City's Conven tion Hall. The fiery dribbling ace was a veritable thorn in Bucknell's side during the last meeting between the schools. Marty Plugs Gap Coach Guy stakes much of his hope on the recent performances turned in by hard-driving Marty McKibbin, who has filled in more than adequately in the absence of Bucky Strassner, side lined with a leg injury. Joe Galla gher's return to earlier season scoring form, and the continued good work of hook-shot artist Connie DeLoca, have further increased Bucknell's chances to humble its ancient rival."

Bison Blitz Sweeps Through North;,
"Rochester, Colgate Falter And Fall","by Jack Gamble Bison cagers, paced by Joe Gallagher's 29 points, pulled one of the biggest basketball upsets of the week as they knocked a highly favored Colgate quintet out of the National Invitational bidding 82-76. Wrong Team? < The Red Raiders still have high hopes of going to Peoria, Illinois for the first annual College Campus Tour nament, but the style with which the Guymen defeated the upstate five shows the Herd to deserve the invita tion more than the Indians. Paced by forwards Joe Gallagher and Marty McKibbin, the Herd went in front at the outset of the contest and were headed only once during the' first period by a mere two buckets. ""Tex"", as one sportswriter prefers to call Marty, took over the forward spot vacated by Bucky Strassner, who suf fered a re-injury of his knee the pre vious night at Rochester. He hit for 19 points and second high honors on the Bison squad. Galloping Gallagher The unusual aspect of Gallagher's scoring spree was fashioned by the dock and the referee's whistle. At the 10:45 mark in the second half Joe was forced to leave the floor on five personals after hitting 11 field goals and seven free throws for the night's high of 29 points. Had he been al lowed to stick around the final margin might have been a bit higher as he was hitting close to 40 percent of his Shots during the second half. It was a slightly altered Bison five that took the Huntington Gym floor due to injuries and the overabundance of height in the Raider camp. The Herd started out strong run ning up a 12-7 lead before Dave Al ton could hit from outside the Bison's tight man-for-man defense and pull the Raiders to a 16-14 advantage. The score remained such only long enough for a quick glance at the score- board as Connie DeLoca came through with three quick hooks. After that the Raiders knew the expressions on the Bison faces meant "" You've Had It!"" Action remained comparatively quiet for the rest of the first half as the Herd outscored, outplayed, and second-guessed the Raiders all the way to take a mid-game lead 39-33. Dodd Left Hooks Bill Dodd, high scoring ace for Howie Hartman, was held to one field goal and one foul shot in the first half but exploded with all he had to cop 20 more points in the second. Even with all their height and scoring of Alton and Dodd, the Raiders could not narrow the margin, which at times was jockeying betweeh 17 and 15 points. The strain began to show in the closing minutes when the up-state New Yorkers put on the full court press. Strella was forced out on fouls and the entire team had picked up four fouls apiece, but remain sd calm and eight waivers later left the -floor with their greatest victory of the sea son. Bucknell 82, Colgate 76."
YELLOWJACKETS FALL,"Jack Guy's thundering herd started a strenuous weekend journey by de feating the University of Rochester, at the Rochester Palestra on Friday night. The Bisons drove the sting out of the Yellowjackets with a great second half scoring surge which net ted the final victory score of 71-64.

"THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.","THURSDAY, MARCH 1, 1951,"
Village Voice,"Bill Wakefield by Bill Wakefield Here's something on this week's calendar that no Villager will want to miss. And Lydia Hoffman and Celia Fqlpher have seen to it that it will take place within just a few doors of you:- 8 p. m. on Thurs day, March 1 --  At the Felcher Apt. (41-6), ,Dr. John Coleman, outstand ing mathematician of Toronto University, will lead an in teresting panel discussion on a topic of primary interest to all men. 8 p. m. on Friday, March 2-- A t the Hoffman Apt (8-C), Mrs. Trueblood will lead a similar discussion on mar riage and family life, which will be of primary interest to the women. These discussions will be in con nection with the University's Religion In Life Week Program and will pro vide an opportunity for friendly fel lowship, ' with prominent persons as leaders. The country's increasing need for trained military personnel is being left in the Village. Each day seems to bring a special delivery letter for, one of the 14 Reservists of the com munity. So far 5 have received a pre liminary notice of recall, while the remaining 9 aren't exactly sure what the future holds for them. Here's how the Services are represented here : Government Jobs Naval Reserve: Jim Holmes; Clar ence Gardei; Ward Martin; Emil Po- lak; Bill Butscher; Mylon Ogan; Dick Bloy; and George Gravell. Holmes and Gardei have received notices but are now on temporary deferments. Martin is the most recent to have re ceived a call, and is requesting a de ferment until after graduation. Marine Reserve: Curt Ivey; Clyde , McAvoy. Clift does not expect a call in the near future, and Clyde has completed an officer's training p ro -! gram and will go in June. Air Force Reserve: Gordon Masters and Bill Bieber. Both have been call- ed but are on temporary deferments. 1 Army Reserve: A1 Bradley and Bill Wakefield. A1 is in the inactive Re- j serve and has not received a call, i Wakefield is assigned to a local engi neer battalion and will go with that unit if it is mobilized. We're all hoping, of course, that we do not have to go back until after graduation. Family of the Week An ex-paratrooper from Buffalo, N. Y., will heed the "" Go W est!"" advice of H. Greeley upon graduation in June and take his family to sunny California. Living in California will not be a new experience for Chet Holl, however, because he spent about a year and a half there as an engineer after being discharged from the Army in January of '46. As for his wife, Dot, it will be a matter of just going back home. Dot came East from Long Beach, Calif., to marry Chet in March, 1948, after having met him during his stay in her native state. As for tow-headed, 11-month-old Stevie, the big trip in June will be something entirely new. Before moving to the Village in June of '49, the Holls lived down town. At present Chet is studying to be a Civil Engineer, while Dot is making a pleasant home and taking part in the activities of Bucknell Wives."

Veteran Tells,
About 'Big War*,
And Breakdown,"by Bob Bell So you're 1-A,.hunh? Well, pull up a chair sonny, and let me tell you about the Big War. I remember the day I was drafted-- I never saw a pool room clear out so fast in my life! They even took the peg-legged r.ack boy--made him a physical instructor. After a pre-induction examination, (pre-induction exam--that's army lingo meaning, "" stand on one leg-- | now on the other leg. 'In the name of the U. S. Army I do hereby . . .' "" ). I was sent to basic training; 126 weeks of it. They taught us every thing we'd need to know in combat: udo, first aid, compass reading, needle- I point . . .  I remember my first post-- guarding a coal dump at the Brooklyn Navy yard. I recall as if it were yesterday the i night I earned my first promotion. I A s I went on duty, I knew by the feel I in the air that something was wrong. \ I cautiously stalked through the fog. I Then in a flash I knew that something j was amiss. "" Sergeant of the Guard-- one of my lumps is missing!"" | And then I was shipped overseas . . . I Coney Island. After two weeks of I combat on the north flank of the rol- | ler coaster, my C. O., Major Louis Berger, sent me to a rest area for j treatment. I had a bad case o f Frost Bite fro m the rain on the Good Hu- I mor Stand. (I know what you're thinking: "" He was in the Army . . . j Our side?"" ) After the rest camp, I was sent to Washington to relieve a WAAC for active duty. For two months I man- ! ned my typewriter in the face of over whelming losses . . . (The Redskins dropped four in a row.) And then it was over. Bands play- ! ed, people cheered, mothers wept for I joy--I was heartbroken. I was back on relief. Then I saw a way out-- I the G. I. Bill. In a matter of weeks I was a Bucknellian . . . and I thought ] the army had regulations! Well, that's about it. Oh yes, T i have a new classification now-- 39-Z. II go- right after women and children. I If you need any help filling out your I questionnaires, just give me a ring-- I Lewisburg 5-1234."
Engine Ears,
NEW STAFF MEMBERS NEEDED FOR 'ENGINEER!,
Box Office,
Previews,"With the coming graduation o f senior engineers many positions in the societies and the "" Bucknell Engineer""  will be left vacant. Freshman, Sopho more and Junior engineers are urged to affiliate themselves with their respec tive organizations. Losss on the staff of the "" Engineer""  will be harder felt if no underclassmen fill the ranks. -----------------------------------------------------------0 The situation is pressing, and it needs action instead of consideration. All the work that has gone into the setting up and functioning of these organizations should not result in col lapse. Last Monday the engineering coun cil discussed tentative plans for the semester. Two appealing plans were proposed: An engineering open house, and an all engineers' picnic. Future announcements will give details. Membership Drive "" The Golden Bridge"" was the main feature of the A. S. C. E. Meeting last Thursday. A membership drive for underclassmen was stressed, and a program for the coming year formu lated. Anyone interested in joining the society shuold contact R. Johnson, F. Pilarek, C. Cooper or W. Grambow. During the second week of March A. S. M. E. will hold a meeting, the exact date of which will be announced next week. At the AIEE meeting last night two senior speakers were presented: Bill Andrews and John Young, who spoke on "" Radio Service and the Engineer"". CE's Play Host On April 1 the Chem engineers will be host to visitors from ten colleges in the Middle Atlantic area. This regional convention will be the first in ten years to be held on the Bucknell campus. Technological papers will be presented by a representative from each college, for which there will be cash and certificate awards. Professor Hubert Alyea of Prince ton will again give one of his unique demonstration lectures in the Lit. Au ditorium. , by Babs Fiedler Thursday, Friday and Saturday at the CAMPUS is "" At War With the Army"" starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Whether or not you like this picture depends entirely upon t h i s  picture .de pends e n t i r e l y upon your personal reaction to the an tics of these two. The picture is a t r a i n i n g camp farce with a plot that was consider ed weak even on Broadway. Thursday at the Capitol in Milton is "" Love That Brute"" with Jean Peters and Paul Douglas. It's the story of an underworld political boss, who falls in love with a respectable governess. In order to win her af fections, he forces a little boy to play his son. The whole thing is a beauti ful job of miscasting. Friday and Saturday at the Capitol is "" Operation Pacific"" starring John Waynz and Pat Neal (who has ex changed her blond tresses for black ones). It is the story of submarine operations in the Pacific in 1943. Wayne is the skipper, and Pat is a Navy nurse who more than likes him. Thursday at the Strand Theater in Sunbury is "" The Mudlark"" , starring Irene Dunn. It is the story o f a little English waif who wanted to It meet Queen Victoria. it is a nice periodic piece. Friday and Saturday at the Strand is ""The Redhead and the Cowboy"". This must be quite new, and the only thing I remember seeing about it was a soap ad saying that the heroine (Arlene Dahl) in this pix used this soap because she fell off a horse. snu"

Gloom Surrounds Switchboard,
Technicians Hidden In Library,"by Pete Tasch Hidden in the deepest recesses of Carnegie Library--cut off from light and friends-- unable to leave their positions for up to 15 hours at a time--a group o f technicians help bind Bucknell University together. Past long rows of dusty, flnusued0 ---------------------- -- --------------------------------- tomes of Congressional records, near Jhe musty morgue of aging papers, surrounded by dry statistical records and references, these five women man the Bucknell telephone switchboard day and night. The room, blocked off on one end by a black canvas sheet, and by a door on the other, is filled with the most unreadable books a working person could want. The room's one window is even with the ground; and when it rains, the muddy torrent splashes menacingly against the bars and glass as if it were envious of the hot, dry room below. This cheerful atmosphere doesn't faze Mrs. Bertha Mallory, one of the operators. "" I think my job is fascin- ating,"" she exclaimed, as she connect ed a caller through to the main office. "" This is a wonderful place to work."" Wonderful or not, the telephone office will move into daylight and the first floor when the new library is complet ed. "" During the week days,"" Mrs. Mal lory continued, pointing at some scat tered newspapers, "" I never have time to read those; but on Sunday--"
when,"I'm on duty for 15 hours-- the calls are few."" Commenting on one of the calls she had just connected, Mrs. Mallory said, "" Although I've worked here but four weeks, I can already tell many people by the sound of their voices; and I can guess many times what they're going to ask. ""That food over there""--it was near a book labeled, Secretary's Report on Some Conference or Other in 1925-- "" was sent down by my sister who acts as my 'famine relief.'"
I,"can't leave the switchboard to go out for.lunch."" Banging, clashing, and creaking in terrupted Mrs. Mallory for a minute, but she explained that it was caused by the ceiling's picking up every sound and broadcasting them through the room. "" It's a weird sound to hear in the middle of the night, when the floor groans,"" she admitted, "" I can often hear the watchman when he makes his nightly rounds."" The local telegraph station is hook ed up here. WVBU receives its news when The New York Times telegraphs its news service here. A cot in the corner of the room is used by the 12 a. m. to 7:30 a. m. op erator who can sleep safely,' knowing she'lLanswer but one or two calls an hour, Besides Mrs. Mallory there are Mrs. Mary Reed, Miss Margaret Ocksreitei, Mrs,- Eva E. Ayers, and Mrs. Rae Cook, tending the switchboard. Although Mrs. Mallory is complete ly satisfied, she does have one com plaint: "" Why can't students realize,"" she asks, "" that she can't connect them to the various houses? The phone directory has all the numbers she has, and it would be so much simpler for them to call the houses direct."""

These concerts have been, in the past, strictly classicalish. But since the students pay for these con certs, and siHce there is undoubtedly a considerable interest in our ranks in music of the jazz vein, why couldn't one of these concerts feature jazz music? An attraction such as LOUIS ARMSTRONG and his group or NOR- MAPSi GRANZ's JAZZ AT THE PHIL HARMONIC crew would prove a sen sation, to put it mildly. Would the administration be willing to try such an experiment ? Or would it take too much guts to try something a little new and different?"

Dr. Norman Stewart,
xxjaosjexjsxxxxxxxxxxseMatxjsxsc,"by Bobbie Maurer Forty and a half years in the ser vices of one university is a long time --twice as long as most of us have lived. Such is the case with Dr. Nor man Stewart, professor of zoology at Bucknell, who has taught under six of its presidents and worked with six pastors of the Baptist Church. Dr. Stewart taught general zoology here for 30 years, but after turning this task over to Dr. Tasker, he has been devoting his time to subjects such as embriology, and histology, and is the present chairman of the de partment. A kindly man with white hair and an appealing personality, Dr. Stewart has many interests. A great deal of his attention is focused on the fishes and vertibrate animals of the Lewis burg area. Nature Boy His main reason for coming to Bucknell and remaining here is that it is an ideal locatiom for ready access to the wild life studied. He has pub lished a number of articles on these animals and parasites affecting them. While on the committee of the State Game Commission, he wrote an article on the parasites of deer. Dr. Stewart has a great interest in oil painting. Writing poetry also ranks among his talents. Perhaps you have noticed that Bucknell's Cen tennial Song was composed by the former music director Paul Stolz, who wrote the music, and Dr. Stewart, who wrote the words. Several of the hymns we use in Chapel are the work of Dr. Stewart also. Canada Born Born in Hamilton, Canada, Dr. I Stewart moved to Rochester, New | York, when a child, and there attend ed school with his five brothers and one sister. The summers of his youth were spent in the lakes and woods of Canada. There he earned part of his college expenses by guiding tourists, tended the University of Rochester. After graduating in 1908, an interest In later years he ran a small boy's camp on the Lake of Bays. All six of the Stewart brothers at- ( Continued on page 8.)"

Following the grand finale, I faced a crucial decision that many Buck- nellians have to make, which one of the many Lewisburg night-spots would I attend to complete my even ing of entertainment. Because I was utilizing the shoe leather express, it was not difficult for me to notice the palatial Seventh Avenue studios of"
WVBU.,"The flickering blue lights, spelling out,our station's call letters, WVBU, (Would Virtue Be Universal) proved to spell out entertainment that put the jubilee's skits to shame. The head waiter ushered me to my table just in time for the first act fea turing Jeff Thompson and Joan Olcott in ""Chatter Box."" The lights were dim, the music loud, and we could hear this popular duo cutting the rug on Les Brown's arrangement of 'Kiss Me Baby Behind Christy's Tomb.' Yes, you too may hear this show every Sunday evening from 8:30 'til 9 when Jeff and Joan bring you recordings of less popular arrangements of popular songs combined with humorous ante dotes. Right from the band box the 'club crowd' was captivated by Tom Eas ley's "" Broadway Hits On Parade."" Feature attractions were Chopin's "" Mayonaisse"" and Victor Herbert's ""Red Light."" As you can see, Tom is currently spinning semi-classical and popular records, strictly in the low-brow vain. You too may be low brow (typical of Bucknellians) and give a listen Tuesday night at 8 'til 8:30. At the conclusion of the floor show, I arose from my seat, walked past the hat check girl, (WVBU, remem ber, serves 'cokes') and failing to tip the hat check girl, I found myself in cluded among broken records, old files, former executives and other has- beens, cast upon the alley of music and words.

Bob Pincus, a Sammy well known for giving advice, be it good or bad, says this: "" Yes, I think they should be penalized, but only for a short time. In this way, the members with low marks would have an incentive to study harder and still not be discour aged so easily."" Well that sounds practical, let's hope it will be practicable, if you know what I mean! Bobby Jones didn't "" know exactly how to say it"", but I think she did pretty well for not knowing how to put it! She finally came up with thi 3 rather realistic viewpoint: ""There should be some way to keep them at their studies but not necessarily the present method. 'Cuz if they can't go to open house, they just go to the 'Burger and drown their troubles any way."" Statistics have proven she is 99 and one-half percent correct. Now who's the other one-half? Party poopers! Craig Hall, one of the Kappa Sigs, brought in some additional informa tion on the subject. He told us that: "" I'd say yes because the present rules and regulations have been set by the"
I. F. C.,"Therefore, all fraternities^ ought to abide by these rules. How ever, because of the draft, etc., lots of students just don't care."" Also, unfortunately, in some cases they (the students) would, if they could, but they can't! Phyl Bell, a KKG, goes along with Craig in stating her opinion. That gal believes in settin' your standards and aimin' for 'em. Which, believe you me, is a smart thing to do! Phyl says: "" Well--if they (the I. F. C.) sets the rules, they (the fraterni ties) should abide by them."" The differences of opinion this week on our sounding board seemed not to be whether or not to penalize the fra ternities, but how they should be pen alized. Everyone seemed to agree there should be some sort of punish ment, but not all agreed on the same method."

The style of painting ranged from the realistic de tailed ""Self Portrait"" to the huge ab stract entitled ""Thistles and Fruit"". Weird Effects Mr. Pickens achieved his most powerful effects in moody pictures like the ""Abandoned Quarry,"" "" Elec trical Storm"" and ""The Carnival"" dominated by wild grays and blues in weird patterns. Probably the most striking canvas of the display was the portrait of ""My Mother,"" remarkable for the unusual effect obtained by using gray for the flesh tones and the placement of a clock behind the figure's head. Using a thin medium of half oil ->aint end half turpentine, the artist demonstrated his forceful technique. He' enlivened his brush strokes with practical remarks on art and concise answers to aesthetic questions."
"Jubilee Skits Bizarre And Funny,",
But 'North Atlantic' Tops All,"Lambda Chi Alpha took first honors at the Post Exam Jubilee last Friday night. The skit they presented was a take off on ""South Pacific"" entitled "" North Atlantic."" It incorporated parodies on all the show's hit tunes such as ""Some Ungodly Morning,"" "" Frozen Isle,"" ""Blubber Betty,"" and ""Colder th an Winter."" Dick Larson accepted the trophy for the fraternity."

Quintet To Wind Up Season,
Host To Muhlenburg Saturday,"by Harry McSorley The curtain rings down on the 1950-51 edition of Bucknell's basketball team as the Bisons play host to Muhlenberg College Saturday night at 8:30 in Davis Gym, Record To Fall Feature attraction of the evening will be the assault upon the All-time scoring record expected by the Bisons. Excluding the Lafayette game, the team had a total of 1354 points com pared to the previous record of 1428 points established last season. This contest will undoubtedly witness a new record. Joe Gallagher, spearhead of the Herd attack, will also be establishing a new individual scoring record every time he drops the ball through the basket. Gallagher has tossed in 376 points thus far, surpassing his record- breaking total of last season by ten points. Lavin Leaves The contest will also mark the fare well appearance of George Lavin, only graduating member of the team. At present the Mules' record for the current season is nine wins and eleven setbacks, a far cry from last year's slate of seventeen victories against only six defeats. The Bisons sport an identical record. . Mules Tough The Bisons will have their work clearly cut out for them since the rec ord books show that, Bucknell has not beaten a Muhlenberg quintet since the final game of the 1947 season. At that time the Allentowners, spear headed by their all-time great Harry Donovan, were in line for a definite bid to the National Invitation Tour nament until they were upset by L. I. U. and Bucknell on consecutive nights. The 84-65 Bucknell victory destroyed .all Muhlenberg hopes for further recognition, and the Bisons have fail ed to take any game since that date. The Cardinal and Gray cagers have continued their unbeatable jinx by edging the Bucknellians 69-67 in their last game earlier this year. Although the visitors have won only hine games this season, several of their losses have been to such eastern powerhouses as Penn, Seton Hall, Fordham, and Villanova. Neverthe less the sparkling play of A1 Rubbert, Elmo Jackson, and Captain Bill Baker (Continued on page 5.)"

Two Juniors Represent BU In,
Two-Way Exchange With Hampton,"Mary Louise Hind and Lucile Swetiand, juniors, will represent Bucknell in a four-student exchange with Hampton University, a Negro college in Virginia, next semester in an effort to increase racial understanding. Administrations of both schools have completed academic and financial achievements for the transfers to oc cur in September, 1951. The four students involved have maintained a B average in courses over the past few years and have participated in extra curricular activities. The program is a notable accomplishment of Brother hood Week and the National Associa tion For The Advancement Of'Colored People. Booker T's School The exchange committee of Hamp ton University (alma mater of Booker T. Washington) is a functional seg ment of the school's administration which effects yearly and semesterly exchanges with Denison, Oberlin and other colleges throughout. the eastern region. To ease many potential administra tive headaches, the two girls coming here will pay their tuition and general fees to Hampton and the Bucknell girls will do likewise. Exchange Every Semester Since Hampton considers such trans fers of students are mutually neces sary for the betterment of- relations between educational institutions, a tacit agreement is usually made to the effect that students be exchanged preferably every semester, or at a minimum, once every year. Students interested in transferring to Hampton on an exchange basis for the second semester of the next school year, or ajiy time thereafter, should inquire at the Registrar's Office."

DR. OXNAM SPEAKS ON,
LAYING FOUNDATION,
FOR A BETTER WORLD,"Wednesday morning's chapel pro gram in thei Methodist Church pre sented Dr. G. Bromley Oxnam, Bishop of the New York area of the Metho dist Church, speaking to the chapel audience on laying the foundations for a better future world. 5 Building Materials Bishop Oxnam named five elemental building materials: Men, rather than things, solidarity of the human family, supremacy of the common good, co operation, rather than selfishness, love and not force as a social bond; these are the hewn stones of our construc tion for the future. Men constitute the first of the fun damental building materials, Bishop Oxnam said. The worth of the indi vidual must first be considered over material things. The Nazi regime worked on the theory of the nothing ness of the individual, only consider ing him as a tool of the State. Solidarity of the human family, with all its Christian ethical implica tions, the Bishop named as a second essential building material. Brother hood, both national and international, combined under the Fatherhood of God, to make every man every other man's brother, must be a necessary part of our blueprint for the future. Best Interests Of All The supremacy of the common good, the best interests of all, must be our third component in building for the days to come. We must think in terms of everybody, a difficult task indeed for the businessman and eco- omist. An adequate Christian moral ity must direct our actions for the best interests of all, to insure a sound fortress for the protection of the fu ture. ""Cooperation and not selfishness in competition is the law of progress"", he stated. Cooperation to accomplish our ends to the greatest benefit of all is a necessary must in our building"
REPRESENTATIVE OF,

THE BUCKNELLIAN,"THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 1951."
The Big Purge,"( E o l u t m t We were going to write an editorial about head chopping this week until we found the letter in our mail that appears on the right (Which Crisis?). We think that covers things pretty well. It's natural, of course, to start looking for ways to cut the payroll when business starts dropping off. The only question in our mind is should this cutting be done on the faculty. We think not. Bucknell professors, never known to be overpaid, have auto matically become a little more than an instructor when they start using Bucknell letter heads. They become a part of the Bucknell Community, and take a quiet pride in this fact. Our professors aren't just somebody you see in class every other day. They're people you go up to in Chet's and talk with, or have over to the house for Sunday dinner or to chaperone an open house. A little while ago we were urging students not to lose their heads and enlist because of the Korean Crisis, a stand on which the administration backed us. Now we ask the administration not to lose their head over the same crisis. If economy measures are necessary, let's count noses in Old Main."
Cool Heads,"Now that the first flurry of rumors has passed, it appears that about all social prohibition is going to cost the seven chastised fraternities is a couple stag weekends. One of the most gratifying things to come out of this experi ment was the way the Inter-Fraternity Council acted when the interpretation was first advanced that social prohibition meant the elimination of practically all functions but eating and breath- ing. Although it was obvious at once that this was not what the people who drew up the regulation had in mind, the IFC is to be commended for the manner in which they proceeded to correct the situation. Its appeal to reason and its taste in refraining from the use of threats was a credit to the students of that organi zation."
Off The Editorial Cuff,"Although other schools have been paying up to $2500 for the privilege of having Ray Onthony at their proms, this year's com mittee has signed the sought-after young bandleader for a much lower figure. Bucknellians will be hearing the man for only $5 a couple, which is about half the usual tab. jfi $ jji a|PS j"
J,"j Now that the Student Aid Committee has taken over the delegation of concessions for selling refreshments in the dorms, maybe the petty disputes about who's going to sell who a sub marine sandwich will end. We tip our green eyeshade this week to a basketball team that, in spite of erratic student support and occasional reproval from these pages and other sources, goes on and o n ------------------- breaking more records."

First and foremost, since appearance is unfortunately the first criteria of success, do dress the part you want to attract. That is, if you want the party type, tie a big black bow sirenishly under your chin and dig up a moldy ole beret someplace. If you want a blase man of the world drag out the taffetas and rhinestones. Cashmeres, tweeds, and English walkers will find you swarmed by the sporty type (you might carry a ski pole for added effect). If you just want a good guy don a wool dress and shove the feets into opera pumps . . . Don't sidle up and ooze in your target's ear, "" And what kind of girl are you looking for tonight?"" They might (and probably will) give you one in credulous stare and go screaming out the door in mortal terror. I tell you I this through sad experience in hopes that you can retain self-respect and pre- I sent exalted opinion of self. If OH turns out to be a complete failure we beg you to regress and dig into the annals of old high or prep days.

Comparable dates this year are Dec. 21 and June 8. Easter recess will continue to be from Thursday noon to Tuesday morning. The University Executive Committee has decided that freshmen will re port next Sept. 13 and classes will begin five days later.

Coincidence, you say? March 4, 1951 To the Editor: The Crisis in the University has been fully discussed in the RILW just concluded. So far as this correspon dent was able to observe the discus sions were aimed at a general situa tion rather than a specific one. What is the nature of the specific crisis we all face here at Bucknell ? Students may be vaguely aware of the real crisis. The faculty is acutely aware of it. The trustees think they know what the real crisis is but they are mistaken. The administration is either as misguided as the trustees or lacks the courage to present to them the real nature of the Bucknell Crisis. Bucknell is short of money. That is news to no one. Bucknell like every male or predominantly male college in the land faces a 20% drop of enrollment and tuitions. That also is news to no one. The operating deficit implied in this situation is gen erally expected to last only two or three years until those leaving college this year have served their 24 or 27 months and return to finish their edu cation. How to meet the prospect of this deficit ? That is the question that has thrown the Board of Trustees and ap- | parently the Administration into such a panic. This panic ha% resulted in their solving the anticipated deficit. This is a perfectly logical and busi- ; j ness-like solution until we learn : WHAT operating expenses are being t j cut. If a motor car manufacturer found himself taking a loss would he fire his best paid men in order to save the salary money? Would he dispense with the engineers and designers, pro duction experts and sales managers who are the brains of his company ? Certainly not, of course! He would cut costs on non-essentials like up holstery, trim, paint, etc., or speed up production per man hours by easing up engineering tolerances on machin ing parts. So Bucknell should find its 20% re duction in non-essentials. I speak of the panic of the trustees because in their desperate and ill considered method of economizing they have chosen the faculty to start with. Look about you well, students, at your fac ulty friends because you may not see them here next year. You won't miss any of the non-essential staff. The grounds maintenance army that rakes leaves and cuts grass will continue to rake and cut. The battalion of stenographers and secre taries and sub-secretaries will be im perceptibly reduced. A university is by centuries of tra dition an institution which is chiefly concerned with men's minds, with learning, research and teaching. The Crisis in Bucknell University lies in the blindness of the Trustees and Ad ministration to this fact. When, in a short term period of deficit such >>as Bucknell faces, it turns to economy of men's minds rather than in typewrit ers, lawnmowers and wrestling mats, I say we have, indeed, reached a crisis. How is it I have the temerity to speak out ? Because, having been one of the better-paid members in my de partment, my head has been chopped off. It will roll in some very good company. Hail and farewell, Bucknellians!"
I,"hope your trustees see the light soon before faculty morale disintegrates completely. Roderick 0. Williams Assistant Professor Department of Music Sqairl Squelched? RILW, A Success Dear Editor: I wish to congratulate the CA for it's fine job on the 1951 Religion In Life Week. Especially with respect to the scope of the problems dealt with and discussed throughout the whole program. They dealt with and were based on problems that arise here in our immediate environment and lives. It seems to me that we, who are in college, tend to put our attention and March 2, 1951 Dear Ed: In response to the letter in last week's Bucknellian concerning the re vival of The Squirl, I should like to give a few enlightening facts. Last Fall a group of us who had been connected with the old Squirl called a meeting for all students in terested in reviving the magazine. Upwards' of 55 students attended thi3 meeting, after which a group of us appointed a staff and assigned all the students to the various departments. We presented this list together with our reorganization plan to the Board of Publications. After a series of meetings, the Board refused us permission to restart the maga zine. Their reasons were, among others, that the magazine owed a large debt, that the old! magazine was obscene, and that the material printed was un suited for a college publication. As far as the first point is concern ed, the debt was contracted because of a three-year contract signed on May 28, 1947. The existence of this contract was unknown to the Board. If they, who determine which organi zations shall publish, did not know of the contract how was a group of stu dents to know of its being in effect. However, after a series of letters be tween myself and the advertising com pany to whom the money was owed, they agreed to cancel the debt. As for the second point, perhaps the old Squirl was off color. Couldn't some punishment other than revoca tion of publication rights been inflict ed? And the third point: the material printed was unsuitable for a college publication! We had on our list of names of interested students many of the students who were and still are writing material for other school pub lications. I agree with last week's letter writ er when he stated that a humor mag azine is almost a necessity. Because we do not have one here is not due to a lack of interest on the part of the students, but because the Board of Publications refused outright to allow a reorganization of The Squirl. James L. DiGuiseppi efforts on world-wide bases, and there fore are trying to solve problems which are out of our scope of under standing and power to alter. In my case, this is where the C. A. loses its all important appeal. This aspect of the scope covered was brought to my attention from dorm discussions and from a particular example that evi denced that the C. A. knew where it could give some aid to the surround ing area of Lewisburg. I am refer ring to a project it sponsored last year. They organized and planned a group that went out to an area of un fortunate people and helped paint the local school house. I could not go because too many people signed up before I heard about i t  This latter fact in itself, proves that similar pro jects would succeed in getting all campus support. Being an education major, I will further my argument in my own field of interest. The principle of the UNESCO of the United Nations is that education o f the peoples of the world can be a strong force toward making peace in the'world. In this light, isn t it our duty, as a univer sity of culture-furthering peoples, to enlightening the immediate a r e a around same institution, that appears to be oblivious to our existence. Has anyone driven to Halfway? Thus, we have an excellent area in which to start our drive to'solve a world-wide problem. But Union County is in our scope of understanding and is within our power to alter. Our aid and at tention can be material, educational and foremost religious. Our heritage seems to make us down-to-earth people, thus we tend to whole-hearted ly support projects of this sort, or in further explanation, projects where we can really see our results. From my above discussion, I am wondering if the CA could lead us toward a project that can give us all an opportunity to apply the principles we discussed in Religion In Life Week to our immediate environment and lives as did the whole program.

People's Choice The Capitol buildup on Ray came about as a result of his being elected the band most likely to succeed in 1950 in a poll of more than 2500 disc jockeys on radio stations throughout the couijtry and Ray has certainly ful filled that prediction by the nation's platter-spinners. During his first year with Capitol, Ray chalked up sales figures of more than two-million records and clicked I with such outstanding disc hits as j ""Darktown Strutters Ball"", ""Count Every Star"", "" Spaghetti Rag"", "" Sen timental Me"", "" Can Anyone Explain"" , ""Autumn Leaves"", ""Mr. Anthony's Boogie"", ""Harbor Lights"" and ""Never theless"". Band Boon Booms Ray's tremendous recording success proved a boon to the entire dance band business for it encouraged other re cording companies to follow Capitol's steps and put greater emphasis on dance bands than ever before. All in all, it is the consensus, of public opinion that Ray Anthony has emerged from the ranks of America's name bands as heir apparent to the Throne of Music, a position left va cant by the unfortunate wartime dis appearance of Glenn Miller."

"Lafayette Defeats Bisons In Last Half Surge, 65-58",
Gil Shor Sparks Leopard Attack;,
Gallagher Scores 19 To Lead Herd,"by Harry Staley A third quarter slump proved disastrous to the Bison basketball team last night as they dropped their twelfth decision this season to the Lafayette Leop ards in Easton. Pa., by a score of 65-58. The contest saw Joe Gallagher notch 19 points to bring his seasons total to 395 points. Bisons Near 'Record The Bisons drew to within 17 points of establishing1 an all-time scoring record for one season. They have now scored 1411 points. Gil Shor of Lafayette led the scorers as he drop ped in 21 points. Barry Love, lanky Leopard center, started the game with a hook shot and Lafayette took a quick lead. Davidson followed with a hook shot and Marty MsKibbin broke the scor ing ice for the Bisons to make the score 4-2. Love then connected with three consecutive hook shots and the Leopards began to pull away. McKibbin Stars The Bisons experienced some diffi culty in finding the range but Joe Gal lagher started the upsurge when he began to hit. McKibbin, filling in for the injured Don Strassner, carried his shart of the scoring burden as did Jackie Webber. The Leopards enjoy ed a ten point spread early in the first period but at the end of the period the lead was cut to four points, 18-14. In the second period the Bisons be gan to find the mark and then gained steadily. Midway through the period ""Marty McKibbin scored with a driving lay-up to make the score 26-24 in favor of the Bisons. Lafayette came right back to take the lead and led 33-31 with about five seconds to go. Joe Gallagher then took a shot from the jump circle and sent the Bisons to the locker room in a halftime tie 33- 33. Leopards Surge Lafayette came roaring back in the second half as they quickly drew to a 36-36 tie. At that point the Herd took a momentary three point lead only to have the Leopards tie it up. Gil Shor, who sparkled for the Leop ards during the game, hit with a set shot to put the Easton five in the lead and they never relinquished it. Buck- nell had trouble finding the basket and managed to score only 10 points in the third quarter while Lafayette was amassing a six point lead. At the third quarter the score was La fayette 49, Bucknell 43. Lafayette cooled down somewhat in the last period but the damage had been done and the Bisons could not get underway. The scoring punch of Joe Gallagher was not in evidence and the Herd slowed down considerably. Late in the quarter with Lafayette leading 62-54, McKibbin and Strella intercepted passes and converted lay ups to bring the Herd to within four points. A technical foul was then called on Gallagher and Shor convert ed the foul."

Bisons In Close,
Skirmish,
75-73,"by Jack Waldron 1 Bucknell's cagers were upset 75-73 I by a surprisingly determined Dickin- ! son ""five"" in Carlisle on Saturday night. The Bisons only consolation I for their evenings work was Joe Gal lagher's breaking of his own individ- j ual seasons scoring record. Bisons Lag The Red Devils of Dickinson Col lege got off to a quick start against the Bisons in the first quarter, out- scoring the Herd 27-15. In the second quarter the Guymen were able to keep pace with the Red Devils, but they couldn't close the gap created in the first period. The score at halftime was Dickinson 49, Bucknell 37. Jack Guy's basketeers started off the second half of the game playing like a new team. They scored 20 points in the third period, while hold ing the Red Devils to 9. Thus the Bisons were really back in the game, showing only a 1 point deficit. The score Dickinson 58, Bucknell 57. Thrilling Finale The final period of the game was a real thriller, including a slight skir mish due to the eagerness of both teams to gain possession of the ball. However, Dickinson was able to pro tect a slim lead all the way, and win the game 75-73. High scorer for the game was Joe Gallagher, who collected 26 points, en abling him to break his last years record of 366 points. Bucky Strass ner added 13 points to the Bucknell"

Bucknell is currently rated within the top 35 teams in the land. Of course, the big news is Joe Gal lagher breaking his own seasons scor ing record of 366 points. He tossed in 26 markers against Dickinson to bring his total to 376. His 18.8 aver age, ranking him among the top twenty scorers nationally, well ex ceeds his previous 17.4 average which placed him 24th among the nations scorers last year. He is currently behind 7' 1"" Bill Spivey of Kentucky, an All-American candidate. Marty Sharp Don Strassner is runner up to Gal lagher with a 13.9 average. Marty McKibbin is outstanding in the foul department. He has converted 37 of 46 free throws or 85 percent of his chances. The team has connected for 315 free tosses out of 517 attempts for a 60.8 percentage. Six of the Bisons have scored 100 points or more thus far."

Hellferich Champ The Bison Matmen put two men in the finals and fivp in the consolation bouts, while Lafayette emerged with three champions and Gettysburg and I Muhlenberg with two apiece. The eighth champ was Ursinus' heavy weight Bill Hellferich, who was voted the outstanding wrestler of the meet by the coaches of the eight participat ing schools. Gettysburg held the Big Cup for the past two years, and was attempting to be the first school to win it three times in succession and five terms in all. But the Leopards of Lafayette fought a desperate battle to match the 31 Bullet points, and became the co champions of the current campaign. Woolcock Pinned The Bisons and the Mules were neck and neck in the race for the run ner-up position with identical team scores of 17 points before the 177 lb. bout. Woolcock of Bucknell, and Muhlenberg's Bob Miller waged a see saw battle full of takedowns, reverses, and near-falls up through the second period. In that period Nelson almost had a pin, but allowed the golden op portunity to slip away. At 22 seconds in the third period, Miller reversed Woolcock and scored the pin with a bar-arm and body press. Score: 24- 20"
.,"Ursinus was the number 4 team with 18 points, 9 of them scored by Hellferich. Winning going away in every bout, Bill left no doubt in any one's mind as to who would win the Best Wrestler Award. Big Bill, mov ed like a lightweight as he made every win a pin. The Finals Gettysburg's Loose successfully de fended his 123 lb. title against Zim merman of Ursinus with a 7-5 decis ion. In the 130 lb. bout, the Bullet champion Jim Woods retained his crown by decisioning Muhlenberg's Harry Adams 5-4. A new champion emerged in the 137 lb. class when the Leopard Maitland proved invulnerable to the Bullet Sam Andrew with a 2-0 decision. Haverford's Gov. Cadwal- lader lost the 147 lb. crown to Lafay ette's Bob Downing by a take down in the first period. The Bison's Robinson dropped a 2-1 decision to 157 lb. Bill Downing, twin Leopard of the 147 lb. Bob. There was no score until the third period when Downing drew first blood with a reverse, and then Robbie via an escape.

Rugged Schedule Ahead As Practice Regius,"by James Douglas Coach Harold Evans met with var sity golf candidate^ Friday noon in Roberts Hall and outlined the prac tice sessions facing the squad before embarkifig on the tough 1951 sched ule. Three regulars return from last year's team and one man who played two years ago. Russ Long, Ben Hoffman, and Van Johnson are last year's players arid Bill Allen returns after a year's layoff. Positions Open Coach Evans said he will need eight men to make up the team, so there is ample opportunity for new men to earn a position on the 1951 golf squad. Some of the new men this year are Bob LeCates, Jack Miller, Bill An drews, and Larry Breakiron. The squad will practice at the golf I course on fair days, but on bad days they will work out on fifth floor of as Jn j East College. They plan to put a net at one end of the floor and hit balls into it on Wednesday and Thursday nights from seven to nine and also on Monday afternon starting at 1 o'clock. Tough Schedule Mr. Evans wants all interested golfers to try out since the first match is only six weeks away. The schedule includes twelve dual matches and one tournament. I April 16--Dickinson ..

Market and Third,"Opposite Postoffice It was a highly superior Bucknell j Freshman club that journeyed to Wil- j liamsport last Thursday to capture I their eighth win of the season over j the Frosh of Lycoming, 83-46. The blue and gold lads found their neigh- j bors just too tough, as they succumb- | ed to the fast break and the pressing j defense of the Lanemen. j Lycoming never managed to make a I game of it as they trailed from the beginning and lost ground each quar- 5 ter to the speedy herd. It was 19-10, favor of BU, at the end of the initial i period, and this advantage jumped to j 43-20 at the half. The Lycoming zone defense proved no problem to the Herd in the second half, and their attack was equally futile. * The third quarter score was Bucknell 59, Lycoming 32. Three of the Bisons accounted for 52 of the 83 points. Halton topped I the roster with 20 markers, while Feigel and Poff each netted 16 points. Crookshanks was high man for the home squad with 10. by Ellwood Rowe With the basketball season drawing to a close, Coach Bill Lane this week issued a call to all prospective varsity baseball candidates to report tomor row to Davis Gym at 4:30 o'clock for the initial get together of the season. The call for interested persons ap plies to upperclassmen only as the Middle Atlantic Conference has not as yet decided whether or not to al low freshmen to participate in varsity sports. A meeting is slated for March 13 when the issue of freshmen eligibility will be voted upon. Battery Needed Lane stated that he is hopeful of a large turnout, for we face a tough nineteen game schedule this spring. He said, ""All positions are wide open. Anyone who has ever played baseball should certainly turn out."" The head mentor continued, "" If we can come up with a good battery combination, we will_have a good season."" Two new schools have been added to this year's schedule. Ithaca College in upstate New York and Wagner Col lege on Staten Island are the two newcomers whom the Orange and Blue nine will have to face. Of the two, Wagner is not a newcomer in the truest sense, for last year the Lane men met and defeated the Seahawks in the MAC playoffs. The season opens with the Bisons playing host to the Susquehanna Crusaders from nearby Selinsgrove, April 7, and winds up with the Herd traveling to State College to engage the Nittany Lions on May 29. Seven Return The squad this year will be built around seven returning lettermen from last year's fine team which com piled an 11-5 record. It will be led by Andy Shirk who will captain the team, from his third base position. Dick Roush is the line pitching hold over; around him Lane will have to mold his mound corps which was de pleted by the loss of Art Raynor and Cal Seaman through graduation and by the enlistment of A1 Hegelein, who still had one year of eligibility remain- ing, in the Coast Guard. Raynor and Hegelein had been members of the Brooklyn Dodger and Boston Red Sox organizations respectively. The other returning veterans are Jack Weber, ss; Marty McKibbin, lb; Flav Nar- done, 2b; Cal Koegh, Mai Sinclair, Bill Franke--all outfielders. First Workout First workout is scheduled for Mon day at 4:15 in the gym. These first daily workouts will be designed chief ly to loosen up the throwing arms of all members of the squad and to get them in as fine a physical condition a: possible. As soon as weather condi tions permit, activities will be moved to the diamond near the stadium. At the some time Coach Lane ex tended a call to anyone who may be interested in the manager's position to report also at the Friday meeting 1951 Baseball Schedule Sat., April 7--Susquehanna .............."

The grinning cinder coach further related that the success of his squad in 1951 would rest solely upon the ability of his returning campaign ers to plug the gaps torn open by last year's graduation. Enter Penn Relays The cindermen, paced by Captain John Schaumberg, will lift the lid on intercollegiate competition, April 27 and 28, in the Penn Relays. At pres ent, there are eight tracksters con tending for berths on the four man, one-mile relay squad, which will be the only group entered in the annual Ben r ranklin Carnival. In addition to Schaumberg, the other fleet-footed aspirants are A1 Farina, Jim Hess, Bob Jansen, Art Kearney, Jim LePard,-Jim Robeson and Jim Thorn. Heading an impressive list of vet eran weightmen, who will team with Schaumberg in the Bison's inaugural dual meet at Muhlenberg on May 5, are Connie DeLoca, Chet Leach and Bill Szabo, while Jack Maeby and Doug Light will group to defend their hurdle events. With Craig Hall, cur rent intramural two-mile record hold er, and Ed Mighell representing the Herd's experienced distance runners, Hess, LePard and Robeson will scorch the oval in the middle distances. Hess and LePard, ' are present intramural co-record holders of the quarter-mile grind. Listed to return to the dash events, century and furlong, are Leach and Charles Stewart, whereas Joe Gallagher and Bill Waite will once more vie for high jump laurels. Impressive Newcomers Among the newcomers who will at tempt to improve last season's Orange and Blue cinder slate, which read two victories and a single defeat in three dual meets and a tie for top honors in a triangular contest, are Brad Myers and Burt Talmage in the sprint ing department; Jansen and Kearney in the middle distances; Walt McCon nell and Frank Meredith in the dis tance races; Greg Bowen in the pole vault; and Farina in the broad jump and hurdle events. Missing from last year's combine are Jim Pangburn, captain and poldeg vaulter; Jim McMahan, dash man; Jack Purnell, quarter-miler; Jini Stumbaugh, pole vault and high jump specialist; Bill Woodcock, shotput; Charles Walsh, broad jump; and Don Davidson, shotput and discus man. by Dort Travis Co-eds Compete in Wilson Play Day After a hectic eight-hour bus trip to Wilson College, the Bucknell Co-eds pitted their wits and strength against the Hood and Wilson College teams. The co-eds racked up a basketball vic tory over Hood, defeated the Wilson team by a ten point lead in swimming, and placed within one point of tieing Hood in the same event. In fencing, Bucknell, Wilson and Hood had a three-way tie. Basketball Team Scores The basketball team upset the Hood girls by a 22-17 victory. The Buck- nell coeds managed to tear away from the Wilson ""giants"" and make twelve points, but Wilson still was victorious. The Bucknell players were: Forwards, Sally Graybill, Ellen Herte, Nancy Keplinger, Ann Lukens, and Ann Tuc- kerman; Guards: Mary Allen, Nancy Geiser, Ellie Gilliams, and Lynn Hann. Swimmers Take Close Second Nancy Cathrall swam to take a first in the 50 yard Breast Stroke Relay race made up of a three girl team, which splashed to a first place honor. The free style event offered stiff com petition to Mary Ann McCoy, but she proved her ability by taking second place. The various forms of dives were exhibited and graded on tech nique and entrance. Charlotte Reed and Hank Hankinson gathered enough points to win second place. Vivian' Abronski, Nancy Cathrall, and Bobbie Simpson concluded the events by tak ing a second in the Medley race. Battle of the Foils The fencers executed a three way tie between Bucknell, Hood, and Wil son. Our Bucknell team was repre sented by Bobbie Roemer and Lee Craig.

PRO F-FILE,
Dr. John W. Rice,"by Bobbie Maurer When Dr. John W. Rice, professor of bacteriology, first taught at Buck nell, Taylor Hall was quite different from what it is today. In 1915, he was instructor of physics to the boys who resided in that building:, which was then the Bucknell Academy, a preparatory school for men. He once roomed where his office now, and ate meals in Taylor 104, which was the dining room. Later on, during World War I, the large laboratory on the first floor of Taylor Annex was the only hospital on cam pus for two years. Born in Williamsport, he was a member of the public school class of 1910. He came to Bucknell that fall to take the General Science course, then referred to as the ""General Snip Course."" Dr. Rice thinks he may have been influenced to come to Buck nell both by the son of his high school principal and his science professor in high school whom he knew well. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1914, and was granted the degree of Master of Science -in 1915, after completing an additional year of resi dence work in the Department of Bi ology. After serving as head of the Department of Biology in Hazelton High School from 1915 to 1916, he was appointed instructor in biology at Bucknell, and has since become profes sor. He received the degree of Mas ter of Arts and Pure Sciences in 1918 from Columbia University* after which he enlisted in the Sanitary Corps of the United States Army and soon be came a 2nd Lieutenant. He acquired the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Columbia in 1923. Relaxation Is Camping Years ago, Dr. Rice was very inter ested in hiking through the country. In fact, he used to hike each Saturday with a group of youngsters from Haz elton, and he still hears from them. He now has two camps out in the mountains. One used to belong to Nelson F. Davis and is called "" Old Gap"" and the other is "" Sand Bridge."" When he takes students on water sur veys, they stay at "" Old Gap."" He'll be making one of these trips May 3 and 4. Dr. Rice thoroughly enjoys teaching, but suggests that everyone should have some different form of relaxation. His camps serve that purpose for him. Perhaps his toughest situation in teaching was in 1931 after he had re turned from a period in Johns Hop kins Hospital. You see, he taught here then in summer sessions from a wheel-chair, and was handicapped for quite a while afterwards. Listed In ""Who's Who"" Having held many interesting posi tions, he was once with the Yale Army Laboratory School and Bacteriologist for the New York Public Health Bu reau. Listed in ""Who's Who,"" ""Who Knows What,"" and ""American Men of Science,"" Dr. Rice is now consultant bacteriologist at Geisinger Hospital, and president of milk control area number four. Incidentally, he is a Mason and a Demi."

"INFIRMARY BUSINESS BOOMS, FOWLE REPORTS","Many Bucknellians seemed to have survived the winter weather without any major accidents, but those poor unfortunates seen hobbling arouiid campus on crutches show that there are several who were not so lucky. Along with treating these ,,twenty recent fractures, the infirmaries have been kept busy this year with several cases of cold and grip, a few requiring confinement. According to Dr. Lester P. Fowle, the infirmary is now able to cure such ills as grip and strep throat in a few days. Years ago, prior to the use of the sulpha drugs and antibiotics, two weeks was the average length of con finement. The infirmary on the hill now treats approximately 50 persons daily. The most common complaints are those- of head colds and accidents due to athletics. Since the addition of many new sports to' the college curriculum there has been a marked increase in these accidents. Before the erection of Davis Gymnasium most of the medical treatment admin istered to physical education students consisted of the removal of splinters! This fall the university added three new members to the medical staff. Elsie Hoffman of Northumberland is now employed in the womens' infirm ary. Isabel Clapp of Watsontown and Jacqueline Henninger along with Drs. Fowle and Weightman and Miriam Yearick comprise the staff of the mens' infirmary."

[ine-Ears,"by E. Prokop At the coiping A. I. Ch. E. Conven tion on April 21, approximately 2000 members from the Mid-Atlantic reg ional group are expected. The col leges which will be represented are: University of Virginia, University of Maryland, University of West Vir ginia, Pittsburgh, University of Dela ware, Penn, Catholic, Johns Hopkins, and Lehigh. Co-chairmen for the convention are James Hunt and Don ald Parsons. * ""Atomic Energy #-- Weapon for Peace"" will be the dem onstration lecture to be given by Dr. H. N. Alyea of Princeton. Toastmas ter for the banquet at the Lewisburg Club will be Dr. Morton Smutz of the Bucknell Ch. E. department. The visitors will also have the opportunity to hear the glee clubs of Bucknell and Princeton as an added diversion. Three student papers are planned to be given at the A. S. C. E. meeting March 15. One of the talks will em phasize the inter-relationships that exist with other technical Societies. It will show that not only can har mony be beneficial, but also that power can be derived from such asso ciations. Finally it will be shown that similar adaptation on the student level will result in a stronger, more unified engineering council. At present, 80% of the lower class- men have been recruited in the recent A. S. C. E. membership drive. The goal is still 100%. Student charters are successful with active student par ticipation, not just membership. The A. S."" M. E. is scheduling a meeting either for March 12 or 19. It will be an afternoon se ssion at which time will be shown a filin from the U. S. Department of Interior--Bureau of Mines. In construction is a new bulletin board for the use of all societies, the engineering council has announced. It statements of opinion about pacific ism. This is strictly one individual's opinion and does not necessarily re flect the opinion of the Bncknellian or myself. Pacificism, according to Webster's Dictionary, is an opposition to war or to the use of military force for any reason. A pacifist is a persomrwho has a mental attitude opposing all war and advocating settlement of in ternational disputes entirely by arbi tration. I hardly think in these cru cial times, that we, as American citi zens, can afford to be pacifists. To stand up against aggressive distator- ships, a democracy must have a strong, passionate belief in its rights and, if necessary, fight to preserve- those rights. Wolf And Lamb Fable The old fable about the wolf and the lamb illustrates this particular viewpoint. Put a new slant on this story and maybe you'll see the con nection. One day a wolf went tc drink at a small stream in the woods. At the same time, a lamb was drink ing at the same stream further up stream. The wolf'complained to the lamb that he had muddied his water, therefore; would the lamb move down stream? The lamb meekly complied, but by doing this, found himself in a vulnerable position. The wolf was able to attack him with eaSte, and, no doubt, had lamb chops for dinner. Well, that ends the story-telling hour for today--does it leave you a little food for thought? Note: The author requests that he be anonymous. will be placed in the lobby of the En gineering Building. Meetings of the Council have been changed from one to two times per month. The coming ""Engineering Open House"" has made this change necessary to .allow for adequate preparations."

The Mike,"by Jim Hastings Just for curiosity, I wonder how many students have really thought why Bucknell has a radio station. When radio became prominent follow ing the First World War, it was rec ognized by educators as a new medium of education for students and the gen eral public. Many colleges owned licensed stations but soon found com mercial stations, financed by nation wide advertisers, an overwhelming competitor. Also the universities found their stations too expensive or a waste of time and money. The purpose of radio, according to the masses, is to amuse, entertain, and soothe, not to instruct, preach, and inform. It seems to me that radio has lost much of its educational value. Just think, here on our own campus, WVBU could broadcast your (r)7ght (r) clock classes via lecture over the radio. When the clock on the hill chimes eight times, all you would have to do it roll over in your bunk, turn on the radio, and let the prof's voice ring. out. Radio has one extra ad vantage over a classroom, for if the lecture gets boring, you can either flick to a commercial station or turn off your set. * Most stations never send out educa tional lectures, just canned music and monotonous advertisements. To prove the point that people evidently enjoy radio just for relaxation, entertain ment, and singing commercials, may he born out by Duane Jones Company, leading advertising agency, when they stated that by increasing the length and number of commercials on the air, invariably the program's Crossley rat ing goes up. Strange people, we Americans. We hear that Bucknell can help disprove this popular concep tion of radio's purpose by making our station just more than a music outlet. A station like WVBU cannot oper ate successfully without the backing of the students and commerical adver tisers. Bucknellians that sign up for work on the station should give their heart and soul into the organization, for WVBU has no. room for dead- wood. If you're interested in really working contact either Ed McComsey, director; Steve Terrel, station man ager; or Mary Jane Mower, business manager. WVBU also needs more"
Village Reporter Pays Tribute To,
Bucknell Memories And Traditions,"Bill Wakefield by Bilj Wakefield By next August, 19 of us shall have graduated. The war service of this group occurred at the time when the fighting was the toughest. Their tales relate experi ences from the air borne invasion of Germany to the as sault of b l o o d y beaches in the Pa cific. Without the GI Bill, many of us never would have completed college. World War II vets have served as ""scholastic guinea pigs"" in a mass ex periment of Federal aid to higher ed ucation. We're glad to know that Bucknell thinks we did all right. Ac cording to the following quote from December's Alumnus, we at Bucknell must have been pretty good pigs: ""Those of us with long memories recall the time when college faculties were inclined to view with alarm the incoming of the GI students. Fears were widespread throughout the col lege world that they would be indiffer ent students; that, accustomed to an adult role in life, they would resent college restrictions and break down a few time-honored bars; that they would never stay on and finish their prescribed college courses . . . Encour aged by the GI Bill these men and women surged into the colleges. By their serious purpose, standards in all the classes were noticeably raised. Bucknell Wives added a pleasant and steadying phase to campus life . . .  It is with deep regret that we fee this fine group passing out of the college picture."" Family of the Week Jim and Mary Holmes have lived in the Village longer than any other couple now here. They're our ""old- timers,"" and they've seen a lot of Vil lagers come and go in three years. When Jim and Mary came to the V. in February, 1948, their daughter, Jamie, was just a two-year-old little girl. Now she's a pretty, young lady who seems to be growing up faster than her parents like to think. But as Jamie gets older, there's a little one-year-old brother to follow close by. Rosy cheeks, flashing eyes, a big bashful grin--supported by an abundance of. activity--that's brother Duane. The Holmes are natives of Wil liamsport, where they started dating in high school. After graduation Jim went into the Nnvy for over 4 years. Late in 1943 Mary decided to join the man of her choice permanently; she married her sailor and happily went with him wherever possible. This family has much to think about between now and July. There's grad uation (Jim's an electrical engineer), of course, but much more. As a Re servist on temporary deferment, Jim is slated to go back into the Navy soon after graduation. Should his recall be unexpectedly postponed, then there's the last-minute task of getting a job. Whatever the future holds for them, we wish this friendly family the best of luck in solving their problems. We know they'll come out on top."

In the for mer department he has modernized his style greatly from that which seemed too reminiscent of Fats Wal ler and Teddy Wilson. He has been responsible for the style of his modem quintet, composed of Don Elliott (who replaced Margie Hyams), Chuck Wayne, John Levy, Denzil Best and Shearing himself. It has scored huge hits on personal ap pearances in top night clubs, and, more recently, in concert halls, as well as on MGM records.

"With silica, water and imagination",
Du Pont scientists have found,
How to Tame Slippery Floors,"Teen-agers in high schools used to have great, if hazardous, fun running and sliding on newly waxed corridor floors. Of late many of them haven't been able to do that. For numerous schools, as well as office buildings and institutions, are now using waxes that have been made skid-resistant. The product that is taming slip pery floors is ""Ludox"" colloidal silica --adapted by Du Pont chemists to floor wax through cooperative re search with the wax industry. If you mix plain sand with floor wax, you'll have an anti-slip surface, but it would be unsightly and thor oughly impractical. With ""Ludox,"" you are using a water suspension of invisible colloidal silica particles less than a millionth of an inch in diam eter."
A problem child,"""Ludox"" was quite a problem child to scientists who developed it. For instance, research men had to know how silica would act in the presence of floor wax. So they turned to the electron microscope and learned that the little silica spheres attach them selves firmly to the surfaces of wax spheres five times their size. But it was also necessary to find out how ""Ludox"" affects a waxy film"
WEEEE,"""ludox"" particles ( dark, in this electron photo micrograph) surround the larger wax particles throughout depth o f film. Magnified 25,000 x. Du Pont ""Ludox"" makes floor waxes harder as well as safer. Other wax qualities -- gloss, freeze- and water-resistance, leveling--are un affected. It is now used by many manufacturers. after it is laid down on a floor. While a polished waxed floor looks smooth enough, it is actually a series of hills and valleys and these irregularities have an important bearing on the behavior of a surface. Working with a waxed surface pre sented difficulties. The electron mi croscope functions only if electron beams-can pass through the mem brane upon which the specimen is placed. And electrons can't ""see through"" a floor!"
Study in duplication,"Often, problems like this have been solved by preparing a thin replica or copy of the surface for examination in its stead. However, the conven tional method for making a replica-- Cross-section o f wax film shows how pressure o f foot pushes the hard ""Ludox""  particles into the wax , causing a snubbing action. the one frequently used in studying metals--requires solvents. These would dissolve and ruin a wax surface. So it became necessary for the chemists and electron microscopists to develop an entirely new way to make a replica of a surface. This they did, as part of a research program that lasted several years. B| With it some remarkable pictures were made. They showed that many f! ""Ludox""  particles stay at the sur face of a wax film, even though they are denser than wax. As you walk on a floor, your shoe presses the tiny silica particles down into the wax spheres that make up the film. This sets up a snubbing action which keeps you from slipping. Much more could be told about Du Pont research on colloidal silica. For example, chemical and mechan ical engineers had to develop manu facturing equipment, including a spe cially designed ion exchange column. Organic and physical chemists used research findings to formulate better waxes, as well as silica-containing adhesives and anti-slip treatments for rayon fabrics. Like practically all Du Pont achievements, ""Ludox"" is the result of close, continuous team work of men and women trained in many fields of science."
DID YOU KNOW . . .,"it costs more then $10,000 on the average to provide the tools, machines, factory space and working capital for an American worker. Du Pont's average operating investment per employee is $17,800. * re . u . s . PAT . orr ."

Successful Religion-ln-Life Week,
Aroused Serious-Thinking Students,"Last week, from Wednesday to Sunday, Bucknell's annual Religion-in- Life-Week, dealing with the crisis in the university as it is confronted by Christianity, aroused serious-thinking students to face some of the most im portant issues that are before the modern world. Dr. Arnold Nash, of the University of North Carolina, pointed out in his opening address in Chapel that the mind of the student in its proper function is his sacred trust. It may not be the single answer to all of man's difficulty, but certainly a vital and dynamic implement to help find the answer. Dr. Nash deplored the fact that it seems to be a common attitude in our society that nothing outside a partic ular realm of human experience could have any application to it. Rather we must, he stated, give all our minds to all our problems, to avoid the fall ing into an habitual 'American Way of Life', instead of practicing a real and vital mental effort. Gems Frustrated Mrs. Elton Trueblood, in the second general session of the Week,, attacked the problem of marriage preparation. Among her statements was the start ling one that the reason for the fail ure of many marriages of college women is the fact that they are simply frustrated; their education prepares them for one thing or nothing, leaving them destitute in the simple necessi- ies that accompany marriage. Loyalty, said Mrs. Trueblood, is the first virtue of a wife. Her comment was that it was the element most lacking in many marriages today, par ticularly those of 'educated' people, who, in their high-sounding talk of marriage, forgot the elemental quali ties of simple devotion."

President Clarifies Policies,
',
Towards Cutting Of Faculty,"Because of certain statements made _____ in last week's Bucknellian, there has * 'j | developed on the campus sufficient > '"" .A t "" "" v confusion and concern about import- ant university policies and problems"
R,
W,"to make advisable a clarifying state- ,"">> i ?jIftL. - # ment by the administration. w B S k,: Bucknell, like all American colleges --;* and universities, is facing next year an acute economic problem although "" i# mm 'S t u f ^ hoped and believed that proper steps taken the problem will not be so acute as to present a crisis. It is important, however, that all people | interested in Bucknell, and no group is more important than the student ' | body, realize and believe that the ad- I ministration is dealing with the eco- !Ell nomic problem presented with intelli- gence, integrity and firmness, as well as with all possible sympathetic con- sideration of the individual problems involved. Once decisions are reached on this basis they should be carried out for the best interests of Bucknell j even though hardship on individuals is necessarily involved. These indi vidual hardships will be tempered with all the aid the University can possibly render. The economic problem facing Buck nell and other universities was clearly forseeable months ago. With an es timated average drop in the enroll ment of American colleges of 25% to I 40% commencing next year and prob- I ably continuing for three years, it 1 became obvious that operating ex penses and next year's estimated in come Bucknell faces an operating deficit of around $200,000. Clearly decisive action is required. In an effort to give the faculty the I utmost consideration the problem in general terms was put before them immediately following the Christmas vacation with the statement that spe- Icific decisions involving their individ-"
I,"ual situations would be made no later I than the end of March in an effort to j give those adversely affected the max- I imum opportunity to meet their indi vidual situation. Since that time con- I stant consideration has been given the problem in a manner that no one pos- I sibly could call precipitous. As far as the faculty is concerned, I expect that the status of all will be made known by the end of March and the number of staff reductions from this year, based on a faculty of 140, may be between 8% and 13%. This re duction, when compared with that of many other colleges of Bucknell's size, is exceedingly low. Excluding two who knew last June that they would not be retained this year, eleven have already been advised that the economic situation will not justify their retention and of these eleven, three are assistant professors and eight are instructors, who are always on year to year appointments anyway. In addition, one full professor and one assistant proessor will not return, but these vacancies almost certainly will be refilled. This approximate esti mate should dispel some of the absurd rumors that are being- circulated. The immediate concern on the cam pus seems to involve no question among thoughtful people of the nec essity of some reduction in personnel but only as to the method being used and the policy on which decisions are being made. Every single department of the uni versity, administrative as well as aca demic, is being reviewed to determine where operating economy can be ef fected with the least possible damage to Bucknell over the long pull. This process will continue right up to the opening of college next fall. Because the faculty is the most important part of any college, decisions in this field are being made first in order to give faculty members the greatest oppor tunity to stay in their own field. This is the time of year when such decis ions have to be made and admittedly the prospects of staying in the teach ing field in colleges, if one's contract Horace A. Hildreth "" . . . clarification advisable"" is not renewed at his present college, are slim because for instance the edu cational editor; of the New York Times has estimated that 20,000 or more teachers in higher educational insti tutions will be dropped next year. Bucknell has not said arbitrarily that a certain percentage of the faculty ! must be dropped next year but rather is following the policy of reviewing each department in order to decide where necessary operating economies would least hurt Bucknell, yet main tain our high teaching standards and meet the estimated shifting student load that military defense measures inevitably bring about. In no case has any individual been dropped or will any individual be dropped from the faculty without the consideration of the case by the De partment head, the Dean of the col lege, and the President. Other things being equal the great est obligation of the college is always owed to the individual who has been here longest. The final test will al ways be, however, not on merely the simply arbitrary rule "" Last in, first out, ' but rather keeping in mind that the first obligation o f any University is to provide the best possible teaching for the student body. To effectuate this fundamental policy of providing the best possible teaching our finances will permit, Bucknell has already announced that, despite the operating deficit it is fac- ing, it will next year, assuming gov ernment approval, raise the salaries of all faculty personnel right across the board 7% % . In view of the fi nancial situation facing us, this action j speaks louder than a thousand words as to the importance the faculty has in the minds of the administration and the trustees. It might almost be .-aid this action reflects more courage than judgment. The shortest answer to unfounded rumors that Bucknell spends a dis proportionate part of its income on other than instruction, or has any in tention of so doing, is to use one of many simple specific illustrations that might be used. Bucknell shows that 36% of its expenses for the year end ing last June 30th went for instruc tional costs while an institution as outstanding as Swarthmore showed expenses for instruction at 35 1/10%. Many similar comparisons could be made. . th e above information I believe will show in broad outlines the problem we are facing and the policies being followed. Interminable but fruitless argument could be indulged in as re gards specific individual cases. Such cases, however, will not be solved by petitions or pressures but only by th1>> attempt to apply the above principles^ I trust the foregoing will be. of some help to all Bucknsllians interested in understanding the most vexing prob lem the administration is facing at the moment.

(Eolttmn,|leab
T H E  B U C K N E L L I A N,"THURSDAY, MARCH 15, 1951. In response to many requests, the BUCKNELLIAN is re printing from our December 1st issue the editorial by last semes ter's editor, Jack Williams, which won the 1st place award in the intercollegiate contest sponsored by the Lumberman's Mutual Casualty Company."
They Call It The Smash Parade,"All of our readers should know the significance of the term, ''Public Opinion"". If not, we'll advance a sixth-grade definition: Public Opinion is.what the public is thinking about a particular thing. Anyway, it seems that the public will always have an opinion of college students. This opinion varies from time to time. Right now, we're entering an era in which public opinion is quick to swing against college students. During the last war, a lot of people resented the fact that some young men were attending college while others of the same age were fighting the war. And it looks like a recurrence of the same thing is on its way. The purpose of this editorial, however, isn't to tell what the public doesn't like about college students. We just used the ""draft dodger"" handle for an example. We belong to a group that is very carefully watched. News from the campus is usually treated in a slightly sensational man ner, especially when the news is bad news. Last week the largest weekly newspaper in the world, one th|t serves over a half-million American families, came out with the following lead sentence to a too-long story: "" Four Bucknell University students, who last week made news when injured in automobile and airplane accidents, proved to be the vanguard of more student news, as this week witnessed five more involved in two automobile accidents"". The effect of that story set tongues wagging all over the country. The words on many lips were: ""Those Bucknell kids are going wild with their father's cars"". It's a shame that the accidents happened. Our accidents did seem to rate more news significance than non-college student ac cidents, but still they happened. It is our humble opinion that the average college senior who is permitted to own an automobile is just as good a driver as the next guy. But we have to take it upon ourselves to prove it! Safety campaigns can be run, driving privileges"
mdy,"be limited, but nothing can help prevent an accident if the individual isn't on his toes. It's an individual responsibility to drive care fully. Driving carefully means thinking clearly. Thinking clearly means staying away from the bottle. But that isn't all. Think ing clearly means constant watch of the road and conscious effort to avert accidents. If you're a senior and a driver, think not only of your own safety. Think also of the other people involved. And think of the newspapers that are just waiting to get hold of the story of your crackup. It's up to us to swing public opinion favorably toward all col lege students."
Off The Editorial Cuff,"Word from the Treasurer's Office has it that that $50 ncfn- refundable charge will be refundable in case of emergency-- national, that is. Let's see now . . . wouldn't that make it re fundable. And then there's the one about the Senior Class forgetting until last Friday that they had to see A1 Humphries about reserv ing Davis Gym for the Senior Prom. Hah! But it was an other wise creditable job of organization. As a matter of fact it was downright successful! * * * * * How about the student who came into Chapel a few moments late and was refused an admittance slip. Come now*. . .  is that the Christian spirit."

BU Hall 11 March 1950 To The Editor: Being a rather frequent observer of the Bucknell scene the last month, and consulting editor of this paper, I noticed a situation develop that was bad Bucknell Public Relations, in my humble opinion. Last semester I was enrolled in a course called "" Public Relations,"" and got at least one thing out of the class. That was the principle: ""Good public relations begin at home"". The term was stressed throughout the course. It sounded good in class, but seems to be rather nebulous right here on campus. I do not think that Bucknell is practicing public relations at home, when you consider that the faculty and student body, two of the University's most important publics, were not immediately informed on the so-called "" Crisis in the University"". Faculty morale, according to many observers, was low. The students were hearing and spreading rumors about ""Prof, so and so being kicked out"". Neither group was well in formed on the current ""discharge"" of faculty members. The school is not getting the facts to its publics. The publicity office seems to be making no attempt to in form either students or faculty about University policy. There has been downright suppression of news about faculty changes. As editor of ""The Student Voice"" last semester, I was very often dis gusted with the amount of what I con sidered "" unimportant"" information that the publicity office diligently pre pared for release in ""The Bucknell- ian"". One of the three women who work there full time admitted to me that her big job was to get news into our student paper. That is, what news the publicity chairman deemed proper. We had no trouble getting ""run-of- the-mill"" stories from the publicity office, but when something ""big"" came up, we were asked to ""hold on"" and follow the advice of the chairman of publicity. I refer, to quote one ex ample, to the story concerning the number of young men who dropped out of school to join the service. (A f ter the so-called ""crisis""  was over, the exact number was released.) At the time we were convinced that it was better to hold off on the story until the ""crisis"" was over. We made our own decision, but what if we had decided to run the story. Where could we have gotten the facts? If only the publicity chairman could have heard students rumoring who was ""getting the bums rush"", or could understand that maybe her decision to withhold news is poor public rela tions! It is my opinion that an im mediate release of the facts would have been accepted by the majority, and it would have bettered the situa tion in the long run. A well known Industrialist is point ed to as a bad example of public re lations for his famous statement:: "" The public be damned!"" Is there not an analogy right here on campus ? One of the big faults of public rela tions today, according to a survey of newspaper editors, is that only the good news is released. Possibly our publie relations counselor believes that Bucknell's publics can't, take bad news. Congress shall make no. law . . .  re stricting the freedom of the press . . . Sincerely, Jack Williams"

Letters To The Editor,"In The Dark To the Editor: We write this in an attempt to in form the trustees that we, a represen tative group of students, should like to know ""what the score is"" on the recent cut back of the faculty. Since we, the students, are the rea sons or which this university was es tablished, and especially since the cost of our education has been raised considerably for next year, we think we have the right to know the reason ing behind the trustee's altering of the faculty. We feel that had the students been first consulted, different changes would have been made. Very sincerely, The Women's Glee Club The Biggest Victory To the Editor: In the past weeks articles have ap peared in the "" Letters to the Editor"" column concerning various basketball players. It is a pleasure to report that I have received favorable comments from several athletic directors of our op ponents as well as one of the college presidents. The following letter, written to one of our students, came to my desk last week and I have asked his permission Ed's. Note: This letter carried the sig natures of 78 members of the Women's Glee Club. In order to save space, they are not printed here. to pass it on to the readers of The Bucknellian. Director of Athletics A1 Humphries, March 1, 1951 Dear Sir: I thought that when I witnessed the Bucknell-Gettysburg game at Lewis- burg, I had seen everything. But last night topped even that. Off course, we are proud of Belber and our whole team, but everywhere I have gone today, people were talking about the player, number 13, on the Bucknell team! So, f you want to call it such, I am writing a ""fan"" letter. I hardly know where to draw the line but 13, 11, 22, 15, and 7 can all get up and take a bow. Please be assured that as long as the audience of last night's game live, they will consider the Bucknell team of 1950-51 probably the greatest group of opponents Gettysburg Col lege has ever had. If you ever find yourself in or around Gettysburg College, drop by the President's office (my home-plate) and you will be treated to the best dinner the town has to offer and a trip over the battlefield. With every good wish, I am Cordially yours, Robert B. Rau Assistant to the President Ed's. Note: Numbers 13, 11, 22, 15, BU-- A High School? March 8, 1951 To the Editor: I have just finished reading this week's Bucknellian, and, along with many of my fellow students, I was appalled when I read the true facts of the Bucknell Crises in the letter by Roderick Williams. Rumor has it that the college has been attempting to ""pull the wool over the students' eyes"" in its newly initiated budget system. Several student discussions have shown the following opinions as voiced informally by Bucknellians: First, the raise in tuition and board for next year are not justified. The average student feels that the addi tional money should be paid toward an improved faculty, or at least a faculty equal to this year's group; in view of the rising cost of living, it is to be expected that college professors, as well as our own parents, need an increase in salary. This, however, is no excuse for a cut in the present fac ulty. While the maids sip tea and nibble on crackers and jelly in dormi tory lounges, the faculty wives pre pare for the inevitable moving day. Secondly, the college could devise some other method of cutting down on expenses if it so desired. Many colleges, some larger than Bucknell, have successfully used the system of having the students clean their own rooms. Many Bucknell coeds do clean their rooms themselves because they feel that they can do a much more thorough job than the maids do. Cer tainly, if it were put into practice. With the women students of Bucknell already well organized under the W. S. G. A. honor system, such a plan would not be difficult to organize. There have been many comments heard in favor of such a system. Why not do something about it ? Certainly any such attempt by the school au thorities would be better than a fran tic and haphazard discharge of facul ty members. In the third place, why is there all this under-cover work on the part of the school ? Why don't the authori ties make some sort of an official an nouncement as to which professors will be here next year and which ones will not? In the past few days the students have received blanks which they must fill out to reserve rooms for next year. Why can't we>> be in- ormed as to the faculty for the next semester before we make definite plans for returning to Bucknell? If some definite statement were made by the appropriate authorities arid the student body was not forced to depend on the grapevine, a more cooperative spirit might be found between the student body and the school authori ties. In conclusion it may be said that it is time that the school authorities realize that they are in charge o f neither an elementary school or a pub lic high school. They are dealing with mature individuals who are pay ing money for the purpose of getting an education to prepare themselves for their future lives. These individ uals chose Bucknell for many reasons; usually, the reason was that Bucknell offered; a wide variety of courses taught by a capable faculty. If Buck- neli's enrollment drops more than ex pected, the draft may not be entirely to blame; the absence of a strong fac ulty could be the reason. This is a matter which affects the entire student body. It is also a matter whch can be settled only by action of that student body. Will this group stand by its own rights, or will the famous iron hand win out again? Sincerely, Mary C. Sellers '53 Where Ignorance Is Bliss.... March 13, 1951 To The Editor: Last week one of the Bucknellian' editorials ended with "" ....... let's coun noses in Old Main."" Why count nose m Old Main; why try to save man hours in the maintenance department why strive for any improvement at all as long as mid-Victorian traditional ism is the Bucknell way of life? Just what are the objectives o Bucknell?

Construe tive cooperation, worthwhile goals initiative, and comprehension are alsi set forth as objectives. Does the Ad ministration expect these objectives ti be furthered by getting rid of some o the best minds on the faculty ?

One of 27 colleges which debated the question: ""Resolved: The non- communist nations should form a new international organization,"" Bucknell reached the semi-finals tied with Temple for first place. In the preliminaries Ernest Kessler and Robert Birnbaum, debating the affirmative, took three out of four by defeating Westminster, Lafayette, Washington and Jefferson and losing to Allegheny. Taking the negative Jack Baily and Dave Shinn won four out of four in the first contests by beating Seton Hill, St. Joseph's (Philadelphia), Penn State and Lehigh. * Bucknell entered the semi-finals with the University of Pennsylvania, Penn State and Temple University. Defeated by Penn State's team, which went on to take first place, Bucknell placed fourth in the tournament. This was the best record the debate team's achieved in several years. Professor Frank W. Merritt, who accompanied the team, was a judge in the extemporaneous and oratorical contests and in the debating .tourna ment.

The club will be similar to the other college Young Republican C l u b s throughout the nation. As a part of this venture, those who are proposing this group have re ceived invitations to send a delegation to the Eastern Young Republican Col lege Conference to be held at the Uni versity of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia on March 16 and 17.

Both Larison and Hunt Hall are holding dorm dances Friday night. Squeak Heineman, who as social chairman is head of the Larison dance, delcared that it is ""open to all"". The theme is that of a night club called ""Club '54"". Talented girls from Larison and Bucknell Cottage will entertain for the floor show. The performers and their acts will not be disclosed until the show goes on. AH this and re freshments too! Hunt Hall is having a ""first"" ; they never held a dorm dance before. The DU 3-piece band will supply music for dancing in the living room and re freshments will be served. Sure and the theme will be St. Patrick's Day! Only Hunt residents and their dates may come. The idea is to make the i dance as much like a fraternity open house as possible. Both dances will be from 8:30 until 12 o'clock. The girls have one consolation, they won't have to leave early to get home on time. Or is that good ?"

"Mules Drop Herd, 80-62",
In Final Game Of Season;,
Gallagher Paces Attack,"by Jack Gamble Muhlenberg cagers, paced by three fast working forwards, came to Davis Gym Saturday and showed Bison fans that their previous two point cictory in the final 25 seconds at Allentown was no' fluke as they downed the Guy- men in their last outing , of the sea son 80-62. The Bisons, though a losing team, were nevertheless a record breaking team that night. Almost every time a Herd point was scored a record was set. Joe Gallagher set the new all time individual scoring record at 422 while the team scoring soared to 1474. Despite all the Highs that fell it was one short that did the trick. Bonacci Boils If you will remember your basket ball, it was January 17 in Allentown's Rockne Hall when Joe Bonacci sank a long set shot in the final 25 seconds of play to capture the tilt for the Mules. It was this same 5' 6"" substi tute forward that sparked the win ning streak o f the .Mules to 15 games as he continually broke through the Bison defense and scored with his most unorthodox spinning layup shot. Lavin In Final The Herd had to play without the services of their second high scorer of the current campaign. Bucky Strass- ner has been out of the lineup in the past two contests due to a couple of bad knees and a bruised shin. George Lavin, in making his final collegiate appearance, captained the Herd and played one of the finest floor games of the evening. He netted only one point, but'his strength was felt in the field general's role. The outstanding difference noted during the contest between these two teams that they were fairly evenly matched, except for height, was not in speed but in all around ball hand ling. The Herd appeared not too (Continued on page 5.)"

Market at Fourth Street,
FOR ARROW UNIVERSITY STYLES,"by Ellwood Rowe Headed by seven returning letter- men from last years Middle Atlantic Conference championship team, this season's baseball squad began training for the coming schedule in Davis Gym on Monday. Forty aspiring athletes heeded Coach Bill Lane's call for can didates to report at the first meeting of the spring season last Friday at which plans for the 1951 season were outlined. 15 On Squad The competitors for berths on the squad are now working out daily in the gym. This array of able athletes includes sixteen prospective pitchers, six catchers, with nine outfielders and a like number o f contenders for the infield positions. From these forty hopefuls Lane will select his varsity squad which this year will number fif teen men. He intends to carry two catchers, four hurlers, five infielders and four outergardeners. Three two-day road trips are lined up on the tough nineteen game sched ule, and with his four chuckers on tap Lane will have one starter and a man for relief, should he be necessary, for each tilt. Fireballer Dick Roush from McAllisterville is the sole pitcher from last year's nine. Speed Essential Speed has always been essential to a-winning ball club; it will not be, lacking here. The prospects point toward a rangy, fast squad. "" Anyone who is unwilling to run won't be around very long,"" commented the amiable Bison coach who patrolled left field for the Orange and Blue tossers during his undergraduate days. "" We expect to stretch those hits; we're go ing for that extra base which will often win the close, ones."" Now in his sixth year of coaching the diamond sport here, Lane added that this will, from present indications, be his big gest team everwith average height of the members hovering around the six foot mark. Coach Lane asserted that only three positions on his first team appear to be clinched at the present. They are, in addition to Roush, A -l chucker, Andy Shirk at third base, Jackie Web ber, smooth fielding shortstop and Marty "" Stretch"" McKibbin who holds down the initial sack, All other posi tions are wide open-- everyone will be given ample opportunity to display his wares under the keen and watch ful eyes o f the head mentor. New MAC Rule A rather interesting innovation is being added to the sport this season in MAC competition. The conference has ruled that a player, once being taken out of a game, may be reinsert ed into the lineup at anytime later during the same contest. As the former ruling stood, once having replaced, the individual could not re enter the game. This rule should go a long way in giving more member: of the team to participate this spring and it is looked upon very favorably in local circles. Until a break in the weather allows them to move outside, all members of the squad will condition in the gym with the pitchers concentrating on their form and all others putting in plenty of practice on the batting tee in efforts to perfect a smooth, level swing. Only sixteen more practice days remain until the season's opener at home against Susquehanna."
Guymen Set New Scoring Records;,
Gallagher Breaks Previous Mark,"by Bruce Swanger Records o f individual scoring, total team offensive and high total for both teams were written into the Davis Gym history books during the 1950-51 basketball season completed Saturday night. "" Push shot artist"" Joe Gallagher, whose 366 points set the old individual mark last year, led the offensive pa rade as he netted a new record total of 422 points via 166 field goals and 90 fouls. Gallagher, a junior from Newark, New Jersey, displayed rada effectiveness as his left hand push shot and accuracy at the foul line aid ed him in taking team honors in four other scoring departments. His game average of 19.1 is almost certain to assure him finishing among the top 20 scorers nationally. Last year he placed 24th. Strassner Handicapped Donald "" Bucky"" Strassner, Galla gher's running mate at the other for ward position, finished the season with a 279 total and a 14.6 game average despite a trick knee that kept him out of several games. "" Bucky's""  chief weapon is the lay-up shot at the end of a-fast break. Connie DeLoca, 6'-4"" center, takes third place honors with a total of 203 points and a 9.2 game average. Con nie, the tallest lad on the team, uses the hook shot very effectively. Jackie Webber, guard, has a 147 total and a 6.6 game average. Jackie works from the back-court, recording most of his points from the one-hand ed set shot. Marty High Marty McKibbin, capable sub for Strassner, registered a total o f 142 points in 20 games. Like Strassner, Marty uses the lay-up to great ad vantage. He established a season team record by sinking 48 fouls in 61 attempts for a very commendable 78.6 average. Bill Strella, guard, compiled 140 (Continued on Page 5)"

P,"A""  -Star,Intramural Basketball Team has been selected by t e intramural league officials and members of the Bucknellian Sports Staff! Wetzel Sharpshooter Leading off at the forward spot on the "" Dream"" team is Ron Wetzel of Delta Upsilon. Wetzel led his leagu. in scoring, coming through with the needed field goals at the right time for the Demies. He also, could be count ed upon for a great share of rebounds to add to his all around play. Aspinwall 'Rebounder Wetzel's running mate at the other forward spot is Glenn Aspinwall who Jed his Kappa Sigma team to the championship of the intramural race. His scoring power and rebound work were a big factor in the Gappa Sigs' winnings. Aspinwall earned his posi tion with his continual drive and hard work throughout every game. Miller Pivotman At the center post of the "" methodi cal combination"" is tall Ned Miller of Sigma Alpha Mu. The Sammies proved themselves a fine team, and Miller was their "" sparkplug"" in every department. His shooting from the pivot spot was accurate, as well as his sharp hand-off passes from the key spot. On the rebounds, Miller, used his height to proper advantage, clearing the boards numerous times. Lum Outstanding Dorey Lum, star performer, for the Coll, holds one of the backcourt spots on the All-Star quintet. Smooth ball-handling, precision passing, and deadly shooting are Lum's qualifica tions. Lum, frequently would out- jump talier opponents, or make sur prising interceptions, in getting pos session of the ball for his team. He always could be counted on when the chips were down. Schaumberg Sparkplug At the other guard spot, we have Connie Schaumberg. Connie's team- work aided the Sigma Chi's to gain runner-up position in league A. His set shots or one-handers from the outside gave the Sigs their extra sparkle. Consistently, he could find a way to pass the ball into one of his big teammates under the backboards. Connie's all-around play earned him his berth on the All-Intramural team. Second Team As is the case in the selection of any All-Star team, it was quite a task choosing between members of the first and second team when the players are of near equal calibre. However the runner-up team is as follows: Jim Panburn, Sigma Chi, and Don Deakyne, Phi Gamma Delta, .are the forwards. Both these men are out standing scorers and rebound getters. At the center position is big Frank Kirby of Phi Kappa Psi. Frank gave Ned Miller a real battle for first posi tion on the All-Star five. Kirby's rebound work could not be surpassed. Bill Keay, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Ted Stark, Phi Kappa Psi, hold the backcourt spots on the runner-up squad. Both these men are outstand ing ball handlers, passers, and shoot ers for their respective teams. Honorable Mention The voting for outstanding players was heavy, so the sports staff has compiled a list of ten players deserv ing Honorable Mention. Most of these players were just "" nosed out"" for first and second team honors. They are as follows: Van Johnson, Kappa Sigma; Ted Brown, Lambda Chi Alpha; Frank Graff, BISA; Jack Schoener, Sigma Alpha Epsilon; Harry Miller, Sigma Chi; Carl Pfizenmaier, Delta Upsilon; Nick Roupas, Theta Chi; Bob Christ- tian, Phi Gamma Delta; Lennie Von Heil, Sigma Chi; Dick Shaw, Delta Upsilon"

Football Players Prove,
Surge On Record Book;,
"Poff, Holton, Siegal Star","by Jim Douglas The Bucknell freshman basketball team closed its season last Saturday with a victory over Susquehanna J. V.'s which made it ten wins for the 1950-51 season against only three losses. Poff Stars Jim Poff, brightest-looking prospect for the varsity next season, ran away with all the individual scoring honors. Jim compiled 250 points in thirteen games for an average of 19.2 per game. He also scored the most points in one game as he swished 27 against Lycoming J. V.'s. A1 ""Punchy"" Holton and Bob Seigal were second and third to Poff respec tively. Holton scored 139 points and Seigal totaled 109. Twice in 80's As for the team scoring, the Fresh men averaged 61 points a game while the thirteen opponents had an average of 46. The Baby cagers twice hit the eighties, 89 against Jersey Shore A. C. and 83 in the second Lycoming J. V. game."
Brains And Brawn Match,
With Scholastic Average,"The 1950 football squad has proven that athletics and studies DO mix. The semester report from the Dean's Office reveals that the 39-man squad completed, the fall term with a scholastic average of 1.432, higher than the all-men's average. Of 627 hours taken by football men, only 6 hours were failing grades. Lawrence Overjoyed Coach' Harry Lawrence is overjoy ed, because the Bisons did alright on the gridiron too. They won six of nine games, including a 35 to 0 vic tory in the traditional Old Shoe battle with Temple University. Bison- football players are repre sented in all departments of the Uni versity. There are no special courses or classes for athletes."

The Maroon held a two point lead at the first quarter mark and increased steadily to the end. Joe Gallagher hit on 12 field goals and 3 fouls to lead the scoring with 27 points. Four Mules hit the doubles columns to pace the Maroon in their final of the season. McLaughlin and Jackson hit for 19 and 18, while Baker and Bonacci garnered 15 and 12 respectively."

challenges,
any other leading brand,
to suggest this test,"by Harry McSorley Now that the basketball season Is confined mainly to the record books, it is time to give a brief retrospect of the 1950-51 campaign, taking into consideration some of the outstanding performers who faced Bucknell on the hardwood during the last few months. Poll Taken A poll of the varsity basketball squad taken by the Bucknellian has resulted in the selection of five players to Bucknell's All-Opponent basketball team. This year finds a formidable array of talent taking the floor for the "" opponents."" In addition to gain ing recognition for themselves around the eastern circuit, several of these All-Opponent luminaries have merited national honors. Davidson Unanimous Spearheading the players' All-Op- ponent team is Lafay6tt6,s Gfiorg6 Davidson, the only unanimous choice on the mythical five. Davidson's both appearances against Bucknell this year have been outstanding perform ances. That Davidson did not exhibit his scoring abilities against the Bisons alone can be seen when we find that he ranked eleventh in the nation in college scoring, averaging 20.7 points per game. Mestrovich Unstoppable Another high scorer who was high ly regarded by the Orange and Blue hoopsters was Andy Mestrovich from Washington and Jefferson. A for ward, Mestrovich virtually beat Buck nell singlehanded on the Bison's tour to western Pennsylvania. His un stoppable jump shot was the shot most responsible for the thirty-six points he chalked up against the Herd. Ashbaugh Outstanding The consensus o f opinion was defi nitely in favor of installing Walt Ash baugh of Cornell as another forward on the dream team. The twenty-one points racked up by Ashbaugh against Bucknell^ served only to augment his outstanding floor play and rebound work. During the off-season this lanky Cayugan is likewise rated as one of the best hurdlers and broad- jumpers in intercollegiate track and field circles. Kerns Impressive Mike Kerns of Princeton takes his place among the best that have faced Bucknell during the past season. The well-built guard played an important role in Princeton's victory over the Guymen at the outset of the season. Speed, coupled with an accurate jump shot, contributed greatly to Kern's success throughout the remain der of the Tigers' schedule. Lamie Excelled , Refunding out the All-Opponent team at center is Penn State's six feet-three inch Lou Lamie. Lou did not play against Bucknell in the in famous 25-15 fiasco at Davis Gym, but he turned in a commendable show ing in the Bisons' return game at State College. Lamie this year was the first Penn State basketballer ever to score more than 300 points in one season. This is a good indication that State s de-emphasis of scoring was not confined to the present sea son. Subs Sparkle The "" substitutes"" for the first team form quite a powerful quintet them selves. Included in this unit are Rhode Island State's John Stewart; Jack Alton of Colgate;' Hank Belber o f Gettysburg; Walt Lenz of F. and M.; and Colgate's Bill Dodd. These are the players who gave the Bisons most of their trouble during the past season. Brighter horizons seem to be in store for the Orange and Blue next season, since every one of these All-Opponent stars will be lost to his respective team via the graduation route. Then too, it's al ways well to remember that every one of the Bucknell starters will be eli gible again next year.

Their high-geared offensive produced 1474 points for a 67 per game average, despite the yogi-like tactics of Penn State in that memorable and much discussed 25-15 farce. An average point total in that game would have placed them near 7G. The record for high total for both ! teams was established February 17, with Gettysburg the co-holders. The final score was 88-86 in favor of Get tysburg, for a 174 total."

"THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.","THURSDAY, MARCH 15, 1 9 5 1 ,"
Campus Quizzer,
Opinion Is That Less Grass Cutting,
Might Make For Less Class Cutting,"Do you think the administration should endeavor to budget expenses by cutting down on ""extras"" or reducing staff members? Well, your faithful reporter has con-0 formed to a popular fad currently on campus commonly known as ""crutch- itis"". No, I wasn't run over by a truck--it all started with the Kappa Sig band--but that's another story and I won't bore you with the gory details--on with the question of the week. The Phi Gam House hands down a one-sentence edict by way of Don DeaRyne. He says, and I quote with his kind permission: "" There are too few pro fessors as it is and the administration should cut down on maintenance men and janitors."" Tell me, have you seen any extra maintenance men running around lately ? A very wary SPE who wouldn't give his name said: "" Cut down on the lux uries--'rakers'."" Can't you see dear old Bucknell overflowing with unraked leaves? Let's not get carried away with the spirit of the thing! Mimi Haas, an Alpha Phi, who is a staunch advocator of Bucknell says: ""There's a lot more places to cut down than on the faculty. Bucknell is a terrific university, you would lower its standing by reducing staff members-- ""Do we really need the grounds cut so frequently?"" Well, rally 'round, all you Bucknell fans! Clearly, something must be done! John Harvey, a well known, and may I add, a well-liked Phi Psi ap proached the subject from another angle. He mused awhile, then said: ""Make a few economies elsewhere than the professors. The salaries they get aren't large enough to make any dif ference either way. The administra tion should try to raise funds from the Alumnae to make up for the bud get deficiency."" And this brings me up to a subtle observation! I don't seem to have seen any professors in Cadillacs late-"
Village Voice,"ly! Don Higgins wished to add a few spoken literary gems to Harvey's ad vice so he said: "" Get rid of incompe tent professors and get better ones. The extra courses and classes should not be too much strain on the budget. However, this could only be possible if there was a little more co-operation between the students and faculty as marking papers, etc."" Methinks there is a hidden meaning in those words! Heh, heh, heh, heh! Connie Young sums up the contro versy in a small phrase of her own invention. She said ""Raise the tuition and keep the tutors!"" And I say, as I hobble away on my crutches, ""Hoo Rah for old Bucknell! It also might be wise to remember that old quotation (slightly jumbled) that I would like to misquote. ""Alum- uaes and their money, I wish they'd part."" (For the sake of old Buck nell)."
"Russ Thacker, '41 Writes",
"War Novel, "" The Captain""","Russ Thacher '41 has written a war novel, ""The Captain"", which will be published by the MacMillan Company in late April. When Russ attended Bucknell, he majored in English, wrote for The Bucknellian, edited the L'Agenda and was a member of the Board of Publi cations. After graduation, he was sent to the Pacific with the Navy Russ is now working on the editorial staff of Omnibook Magazine. His new book, ""The Captain"" will be on sale locally. by Bill Wakefield With the recent ending of the Inde pendent League schedule, the Village basktball team posted a record of 2 wins and 4 losses. Not too good a record, it is true, but the games pro vided plenty of fun and exercise. Play ing manager Ralph Webster r e p o r t s that on more than _____ one occasion key *(r)'* * ^ (r)  players were kept Bill Wakefield at home to baby sit while Mamma went out for the even ing. Eh, Gads--the headaches of a coach with a group of ""old married men!"" Team members were: Peters, An drews, Anderson, Lloyd, Seiner, Shar- adin, Butscher, Ogan, Felcher, Blpy, and Clothier. High-point man was Bill Andrews. From The Horses Mouth Official word has been passed along that there will be no toleration of (1) parking cars on the grass and (2) keeping of pets. Only comment: ""A word to the wise . . ."" Community cooperative spirit was shown last Friday night when couples who did not attend the Prom baby-sat for couples who went. Even with a last minute request, the Dick Bloys and Bill Andrews kindly changed the setting of their bridge game from the Andrews Apt. to our so we could go to the prom. Not only that, when we got home, our baby-sitters served us cake and coffee--their cake and coffee. Anyone ever hear of such nive baby-sitters? Almost like Ripley! Family of the Week: Seven years ago Curt Ivey was a Marine serving in the Pacific. In Washington, D. C., Doris, his wife, was working for the Government and waiting patiently for her husband to come home. He finally did. And today Curt-- with 5 years' service behind him--is a senior biology major, while Doris is a successful housewife--and also the mother of 3 very handsome children "" Skeeter,"" Arthur, and Beth Ann are 3 healthy, active youngsters who have made a lot of friends since they came to the Village in February of '50. In view of the good record already made at Bucknell by their Daddy and two uncles, it's almost certain they, too, will be Bucknellians in the 1960's. Curt, a real student who averages 19 hours each semester, is from Green wich, Conn. Doris, a member of the Theater Guild and the Junior Civic League, and past president of Buck nell Wives, comes from Washington,"
D. C.,"This couple's 7 years of happily married life certainly proves there's nothing wrong with blind dates! That's how they met. The Ivey s lived in Conn, for over a year before coming to Bucknell. Since becoming a ""college family"" they've very successfully been able to make ends meet, but we marvel at thir accomplishment. One thing we know: There's a ""heap o' success"" brewing for this diligent family, for they know that an ounce of sacrifice today is worth a pound of reward to morrow. l i m i  l i u t i  II H i l l  II III!

PROF-FILES,
Professor William H. Schuyler,"by Bobbie Maurer How would you like to hand in a photograph as a final exam in one of your courses? This can be easily arranged if you take a course in photogra phy with Professor William Schuyler, assistant professor of Chemical Engi neering, whose interests in photography have developed into a course in oar curriculum. matches the other weekend. Profes sor Schuyler had been asked to pro vide a phonograph on which to plajr the "" Star-Spangled Banner."" The only one available was rather old, and much to the amusement of everyone, when they were asked to stand for the national anthem, no music met their ears. After a period of silence they"" were told to be seated--the machine didn't work. Has Garden And Bee Hives At present Professor Schuyler ie doing research on colloids and emul sions, and is working on cosmetic preparations. Both Professor Sim mons and he are developing a shampoo and a silicone type auto polish. He is married and has three sons. Aside from photography, he spends his spare time taking care of his garden in col lege park, and has a dozen bee hives besides. A past master of the Ma sonic lodge in Lewisburg, he was a 32nd degree Mason in Williamsport- He is also an SPE on campus. Listed in ""American M en o f Science,"" ""Who's Who in The East,"" and ""Chemical Who's Who"" Professor Schuyler is a member of several asso ciations. Among these are the Amer ican Chemical Society, American So ciety of Engineering Education, American Association of University Professors, Alpha Chi Sigma - (pro fessional Chemistry and Chemical En gineering), and KAM (national hon orary photography fraternity). He also offers an advanced course in color photography, and holds an exhibition of the best products of his classes in Roberts Hall, which will start May 2. Professor Schuyler was born right around the corner in Milton. After attending Milton High School, he came to Bucknell and graduated in 1915. He began to teach here and has been with us for 35 years. He spent a year in the army with the Chemical Warfare Service at American Univer sity in Washington, D. C. After spending a year at Columbia, he did graduate work at the University of Virginia. He helped start the junior college at Wilkes-Barre, now Wilkes College, and spent eight years there. It was there that he became interested in photography and joined the Wilkes- Barre Camera Club, an old and noted organization.

cm..,"ScA/oo . PS PS j S b THE ANTHONY AFFAIR . . .  The Cat had not heard RAY ANTHONY since last summer, and last Friday Ray showed a better, more subdued band than before. It has been cleaned up considerably; the sections, with the possible exception of the rhythm, played together better than they did, and the tone of the band is less blatant and, among the trombones especially, more mellow. Its ballad style is still a bastardized Miller, employing the familiar ooh-wahs, but it shows no special style in the rest of its num bers. It played many interesting in strumentals. Ray kept excellent tempos through out the evening, but he was trying too hard to be a personality boy up front; more attention to his horn might be in order. He has two good singers: TOMMY MERCER, who sounds fine in his softer moments when not too much is going on behind him; and pretty JACKIE LYNN, who sings with con siderable feeling. Of course, neither singer could be heard to advantage due to the wonderful Bucknell micro phoney. Who was responsible for that disgrace ? Ray's show was a big hit and was very well done. All in all, Anthony presented a good all-around band, which, unfortunately not distinctive, gave a thoroughly acceptable perform ance."

To Be Featured In Library,"-- #'- ### -- -- ...... . ' by Shirley Kistler The fact that the Ellen Clarke Gertrand library will outshine the Bison in popularity may be exaggerated, but I think that the new library will be a place where students won't mind studying. You say you hate to go to the li brary! Ladies and Gentlemen I have news for you. Our new library, which should be ready for use by late spring, will be the student's dream place to study or relax with a favorite book. The reading rooms located one on first floor and one on second floor will contain long and round tables and leather upholstered chairs to match the walls and draperies. The large periodical reading room will contain j the current issues of magazines and sbassai M EEeEi. lounge furniture in which to enjoy them. The easy chairs and floor lamps will create a homey atmosphere in the browsing room, a smaller room on the second floor. Seminar Rooms For the longer winded students there will be three seminar rooms con taining long tables to encourage in formal as well as formal discussions. The artistic portion of the student^ body has been provided for in the music listening room, (Music 100 stu dents take note) a large room for Tare books, and an area reserved for art exhibits. In the basement and | storage room will be three classrooms j and a projection room accommodating one hundred people Sorry everybody but the elevator is only for the staff. To makeup for this, however, small desks have been placed at the end of each aisle in the stacks, which are located on tw.o mez zanines. This convenience will save"

THE MUSIC MART,"(Across from Campus Theatre) Richard Widmark. This too much pub licized film is the usual run of war pictures, except the Marines are taking the spotlight. Thursday, at the Capitol Theater in Milton, is ""T h e Mudlark"" starring . Irene Dunne. This provincial piece has already been re viewed in this column, but the words sad, sweet, and touching are the best adjectives that can be used about a little vagabond's search for the queen of England. Friday and Saturday at the Capitol in Milton is ""Call Me Mister"" starring Betty Grable, Dan Dailey, and Danny | Thomas. This is short, dull, trite, and technicolor. Betty Grable plays' Dan Dailey's estranged wife, whom he meets accidently (he recognizes her legs) in Japan. Dan is in the service, and Betty is a member of the CATS (Civilian Actress Troupe). Betty is still in love with ""joy boy, the lipstick colleeter,"" as Dan is referred to by her friend. After suitable complica tions involving a georgeous captain (male), and songs and dances, all is well, except the audience. Thursday and Friday at the Strand Theater in Sunbury is "" September Af fair,"" starring Joseph Cotton and Val- li. These two meet when a plane croashes and they are believed to be dead. They fall in love, and decide to let the rest of the world go bye. How ever, they find out that it isn't as easy as it seems. Good sob story. Saturday at the Strand is ""O, sanna starring Rod Cameron. Su- many trips up and down stairs am enable the student to have all his ref erence at his finger-tips."

Pontiac Motors,"On the evening of March 10, 1876, <on the top floor o f a boarding house in Boston, the telephone carried its first intelligible sentence. It seemed like a miracle to our grandparents and great-grandparents. Yet today, the telephone is a part of our everyday living. And that is the real miracle -- the fact that the tele phone has come to mean so much to so many people in so many ways. The telephone is an indispensable tool o f business and government -- to day's tremendous job o f production and defense could not be carried on without it. It serves in minor emer gencies and great ones. It helps main tain family and community ties. And it keeps right on growing and improving. Never in the history of the tele phone has it been so valuable to so many people as right now. *"

We were in that cubby hole in the rear of the Davis Gym belonging to the instructors. Opinion Of Modernism Here was his opinion of modernism. "" As far as the general American public is concerned, modernistic music, will not advance to the stage of popular and dance music. Now it's in its trial state. One form of modernism, bop, has been tested, and failed the entrance exam."" He felt that the masters, Stan Ken ton and George Shearing, have achiev ed great advances. He concluded, ""How much of it will or CAN be ac cepted, will be determined by time __ and the public."" ""The Young Man with the Horn"" was born in Cleveland, Ohio on Jan uary 20, 1922, (29 years) where he started playing the horn at the tender age of twelve. At sixteen, he was accomplished enough to work with A1 Donahue and his band. One year later, he was playing with the late Glenn Miller. While with Glenn, he assisted in the priceless recordings of ""Anvil Chorus,"" "" Chattanooga Choo Choo,"" and "" Perfidia."" His facial similarity to Actor Cary Grant didn't help him in Hollywood, when he made ""Sun Valley Serenade"" , with the Miller aggregation. Soon, he found himself with Jimmy Dorsey, Upon discharge from the Navy, the original band stuck together. Out of the 20 members, 17 were playing with the orchestra at his initial opening at the Paramount in 1948. Around this time, he got married--to one of the vocalists. "" Speaking of volacists ------ ,"" I start ed. ""My vocalists?:"" he- repeated. ""Come over here."" I followed the little man in the purple-checked jacket, over to a group of men and a girl, talking in the corner of the room. Ray s outfit stood out from the con servative tan clothes of the band members. He introduced me to Jackie Lynn, first. She's taking Betty Holi day's place as femme vocalist. Then came Tommy Mercer, former singer # with the late Eddy Duchin, Charlie Spivak and Buddy Morrow. He can be distinguished from a John of the same surname, because Tommy's legal name is Tony Mattola. Kenny Trimble is featured on the T-bone as well as on novelty vocals. Two other men from the band join in to blend into the Skyliners. Ray returned to the desk and whip ped out a deck of cards. Bob, the band-boy, came over. The game was gin rummy. I kept asking questions while Ray dealt the cards. Bus Driver And Bass Player The band had just arrived from a date at Fort Knox and had hotel rooms in Philadelphia. The bus driver was the bass player, so they had to keep him sober tonight. On the nineteenth of March, they're opening for an in definite period at the Meadowbrook in New Jersey. They'll be back in the New York area again this sum mer, at the Cafe Rouge of the Hotel Statler. Gin He picked up an ace and laid down a deuce. He had one ear cocker for my question. ""What record do you consider to be your biggest success, commercially and artistically?"" He answered, "" Commercially, of course, Harbor Lights' and 'Nevertheless' were tops. The people liked them best."

A good way to stunt or de form these attitudes in the budding stalges is to remove all originality and expression of new ideas from the scene. The Administration may say that the situation is deplorable, but that nothing can be done. Dropping faculty members has saved money, but does the five percent salary raise to the remaining faculty members save any money? All of this business of faculty changes comes as a surprise to the student body. This is the result of the Administration's systematic policy of keeping the student body in the dark when it comes to policy and oper ation. Would the Administration like to try a student referendum pertain ing to faculty cuts? Perhaps the students could find other things they would rather do without than compe tent instructors. Ignorance may be bliss in some quarters, but student minds should not be relegated to those quarters. David W. Norwine"

Honor System Forum,"""Indifference seems to be the main obstacle for the establishing of an academic honor system at Buck nell."" This statement evolved from the student forum held March 18 during student church on the academ ic honor system. Students who participated in the forum were Ronald Unger, Ann Coop er, Robert Laub, Sally Hitchens, Gray Rogers, Sylvia Harbaugh and Jack Maeby; all chairmen of the various committees. In April elections will be held for new officers. Summarizing what the committee felt were the needs of Bucknell, Gray Rogers, co-chairman of the Scholastic Honor System, first asked ""Why should we have an academic system?"" He felt that the cheating which is occurring on this campus is creating a crisis. There are various reasons why stu dents cheat: The proctoring system is at fault and needs changing; students seeing others cheat, feel it is the thing to do and also cheat; men who wish to avoid drafting and be accepted at graduate school need the good grades which are gained by cheating. Students need tradition, and an honor system could become such a tradition to which the students would look with pride, he went on. Gray then told of the set up of the Honor System Committee. The Cen tral .Committee meets once a week as do th our other committees--Publicity, Student Faculty, Student Directorship and Student Administration. Reporting for the Publicity commit tee, chairman Ann Cooper said that it has sent questionnaires to approxi mately a hundred schools. Thirty- five schools that have a successful I honor system have replied, while others with unsuccessful systems have yet to answer. Each school has dif ferent methods of reporting and pun ishing which might be used here, de pending on the opinions of the stu dents. Bob Laub and Sally Hitchens head the Student Directorship Committee which works directly with the student body. Bob Laub stated that the most important task is to educate the stu dent body by means of the grapevine, by a pamphlet with questions and an- swers, now in process, and by having speakers come and explain various methods used. By these means he hopes the students will* be persuaded to accpt the academic honor system. The Student Faculty committee headed by Jack Maeby and Sylvia Harbaugh bridges the gap between the faculty and students. They have polled about half of the faculty and found it overwhelmingly in favor of such a system, though most faculty members added the impetus should come from the students. Ronald Unger, chairman of Student Administration, serves as a link be tween administration and students. ""President Hildreth is in favor of a system and he feels it must come from the students. When the students can prove it will work at Bucknell, we will get the support of the administra tion,"" Unger said."
Student Chapel Program,"Wednesday's Chapel program, a joint effort of the University and the student administrative branch of the committee on the honor system, pre sented Jo Hyatt of Oberlin .University. Miss Hyatt's remarks were prefaced by a statement from Dean Coleman that the University was more than willing to institute such a program, but the action must of necessity come from the students. Give Faculty Proof ""The only way to eliminate cheating is to prove to the faculty that you are capable of governing yourselves,"" Miss Hyatt said. At Oberlin this was the entire basis for the system. She explained that the honor system covers all tests, lab work, and any work which the professor desires un der the honor system. Legislation is now under way to bring all work that is done for credit under the jurisdic tion of the honor system. The Oberlin Honor Committee has four functions: education, prevention, initiation, and judicial. The first of these is by far the most important, having effect on all the others. Must Sign Pledge Freshmen at Oberlin are thoroughly j educated in the honor system when they enter, and must sign a statement of their willingness to accept respon sibility under the honor system. Under prevention, professors are re quired to leave the room during the exams, and to make up separate exams for each class section. The function of initiation allows constant changes of defects, new in terpretations,, and necessary additions to the system. Finally, Miss Hyatt explained the judiciary function, which tries the of fenders. It is a major responsibility | for the individual student to report offenders, for the honor system must be maintained to prevent cheating. It also permits research as to why students cheat, and thereby makes ad ministration of the system more ef fective. Remain Anonymous Students reporting offenders re main anonymous. The offender is examined by the honor board, and a unanimous decision must be reached. Offenders are not expelled for first offenses, but may be for the second. In all cases the offense is recorded on the student's record. Bucknell, Miss Hyatt said, would only want such a system under cer tain circumstances. If the students I decide that they wish to eliminate cheating, and be recognized as a re sponsible student group with a higher attitude toward education; if the fac ulty wish better student relationships and less unpleasant proctoring; if all concerned vrish better prestige for our school, then we want the honor sys tem, she said. But, she said, the honor system is not an automatic thing. It must be instated by a group of students who feel the need of a higher mode of conduct. Her closing comment was: ""Are you ready to accept the chal lenge ?"""

Lowen- stein said the association, which rep resents students at 335 colleges and universities, was deeply concerned with recent developments in college sports. ""It is certainly a blight on the edu cational community to find such flag rant violation of the whole spirit of intereollegate sports as evinced in the bribing of some college basketball players,"" he said in a statement. Among the things the committee will consider will be athletic hiring and firing policies, the amount of stu dent participation in formulating ath letic policy, and the extent of com mercialization and subsidization in athletics. The committee will be composed of students and teachers from all sec tions of the country. The members will be named soon. Lowenstein said he hoped the com mittee would proide the type of in formation that will enable -colleges j and universities ""to restore athletics to its proper place"" with a ""maximum of honesty and a minimum of sham.""

Editor Spencer has announced that any suggestions from the student body concerning the make-up or con tent of the Handbook will he welcom ed and considered by the staff."

Phillips University Experiments,
With Student-Faculty Inspired,
Honor System In Classrooms,"Phillips University reports that it-now has the distinction of being the only school in Oklahoma operating on the Honor System. The plan was work ed up by the Student Council Honor Committee, made up of half faculty and half students, representing all clubs, classes, and departments of the univer- sity. Faculty and students are under ob ligation to follow the rules stated in the Code of Ethics, and the following seven points of the Bill of Responsi bilities: (1) To become informed of aims, traditions, facilities, and regu lations of the university; (2) To pro tect property of the university and of others; (3) To promote the edu cational process with good classroom manners and interest in studies; (4) To take exams according to rules"
_,"without giving or receiving aid; (5) To take action, upon knowledge of unfair behavior; (5) To# promote stu dent opinion in favor of honesty; and (7) To recognize that grades are secondary to obtaining an education. In 1942, according to Dr. S. Harvey Clark, professor of modern languages, the Honor System was voted down because of a clause under which stu dents could be dismissed from school for cheating. The new system al lows for classmates to call down a cheater--and only someone who is persistent in doing it will be reported to the student-faculty committee. Vote for the Honor System was three to one in favor; it was installed at a Student Body meeting, when the Bill of Responsibilities was read in unison. Phillips is following out standing schools such as Stanford, West Point, and the University of Virginia, in the inauguration of an Honor System. A representative from the U. S. Naval Air Development Center (NA- DC) will be in the Vocational Place ment Office to interview and hire graduatnig engineering seniors, Mon- 1 day, April 9, at 9:00 a. m. Electronic, electrical, mechanical, and aeronautical engineering students will be considered by Richard S. Milne, the representative. He will also dis cuss positions now open within the Center, and a summer program open for engineering juniors. The Peddie-Bucknell Club, compris ing graduates of The Peddie School, Hightstown, * N. J., attending Bucknell University or living in Union County, will hold its annual dinner and re union in the Hotel Lewisburger, Lew isburg, Pa., on Wednesday evening, April 4, at 6:00 p. m. Dr. Carrol O. Morong, Headmaster of The Peddie School, will represent the school. Arrangements for the re union dinner are under the direction degf William S. Retiz, '47, Chairman of the Peddie-Bucknell Club."

THE BUCKNELLIAN,"FRIDAY, MARCH 30, 1951."
One For Mother Goose,
Column,"Once upon a time in a far off land called California there was a group of men who wanted to do something to make sure their college students were getting the ""right'' kind of education. They got together and talked and talked but they couldn't figure out what they should do. Fnally one of the lttle men stood up and said, "" I've got t! We'll make all the professors sign a piece of paper saying they are not Communists."" ""Huzzah!"" They all cried. ""That's the answer."" Then they made a law to that effect and all went home to tell the voters of the magnificent thing they had done. But these little men had forgotten o-n-n-n-e little thing: Communists will sign anything; all you have to do is ask them. Besides that, some of the higher principled professors considered the paper an invasion of their personal rights. It was too bad one of the little men hadn' t thought of this, because as it turned out the whole thing developed into a bi-i-i-g witch hunt and everybody lived unhappily ever after. But that's not the end of our story. Today some other little men are getting together and putting before the legislature of this state a proposal which, says that any employee of the state (this means teachers in the public school system and state sup ported universities) should be required to ""make a written state ment under oath or affirmation . . . .  that he or she is not a sub versive person."" Now this could admittedly affect Bucknell only under the broadest interpretation of the bill (Bucknell is tax-free), but it's a start. Apparently these little men in Harrisburg have also forgot ten one little thing. Perhaps we should remind them. The representative sponsoring this bill is State Senator Albert R. Peghan."

That is a letter from a television agent in New York who is recruiting talent for a series of TV produc tions beginning next Fall. Students from selected (he says) colleges are being encour aged to plan a half-hour show for consideration by this concern. If accepted, the show will be produced on the program in New York as Bucknell's entry in the intercollegiate series. It would seem a shame to let all that talent unveiled at the Uost-Exfim Jubilee go to waste, and this looks like a good oppor tunity to get a little advertisement for the 300 Acres.

THE BUCKNELLIAN,"Lewisburg, Pa. Dear Sir: I have been interested, and concern ed, by the various letters, editorials, articles, and comments concerning the present ""crisis in the University"" which 'has been precipitated by the recent announcements concerning the release of certain faculty members. As one who was on the receiving end of such a release some 18 years ago, not at a time when emplyoers were begging for competent men but rather when jobs of any sort were al most impossible to get, I feel that I may be in a better position to com ment oh such a situation than many of my colleagues or students who never have experienced such times. Wouldn't it be fair to ask just how much these critics actually know about the problems facing the administra tion? Wouldn't it be fair to ask just why so many students as well as some faculty members, who have been on Bucknell's campus only for periods of from one to three years, who have no appreciable business or administrative experience, whose investment in Buck- nell is infinitesimal compared to that of the generations of faithful faculty and administrative personnel who have made Bucknell what it is today, should presume to dictate to~an admin istrator of the -caliber of President Hildreth? Wouldn't it be fair to ask how much these self-appointed critics know about the other economies that may be planned or that will be effect ed in the near future ? Probably each of us knows,' or thinks he knows, of places where money could be saved, but how do we know that those econo mies will not be effected? And, to put it bluntly, how can any organiza tion, except the present administra tion in Washington, retain unneeded personnel, particularly in the lower ranks where the experience factor is relatively small, when there is not enough constructive work to keep (Continued on Page 4) March 10, 1951 Dear Mr. Editor: The anonymous opinions on pacifi cism in Miss Vouyoukas's column in your edition of March 8, interested me very much. They interested me because from them I received the im- prssion that their author was some what confused. I would appreciate it if you would print this letter which is primarily to that person. If you--whoever you are--define pacificism as "" ....... opposition to war .......and advocating settlement of in ternational disputes entirely by arbi tration,"" then, it seems to me, we should all be pacifists. I, or one, am wholeheartedly in favor of peaceful settlement of disputes and believe every possible means should be used to effect this type of settlement. Men are not wolves or lambs. They have the power--whether they use it or not --to reach agreement between them selves. Consequently, I am in favor of the four power conference now going on in Paris; I see the infinite value of a neutral India through which to nego tiate peacefully with China, and would even suggest letting Europe remain neutral in order to act as a mediator between our own country and Russia, According to your definition, I am cer tainly a pacifist. I feel we should exhaust every available means to settle differences of opinion peace fully. But if, despite all t hese attempts, war comes, then I feel--as you ap parently do--that we must fight; not to do so would be being calamitously unrealistic. I would be fighting, how ever, not because I am an American or to protect Democracy or for any such equivocal reasons as those, but rather to preserve a cultural heritage which has its origins in ancient Greek Civilization, a way of life which.stim ulates and encourages free thought and the exchange of ideas, a type of society which allows one to express his opinions in a public newspaper without fear of signing his name. Thomas C. Hickey"
Off The Editorial Cuff,"We would like to meet the man who lined up the janitors and assigned them to their various posts. The one who got the library assignment sounds like a labor foreman every time he gets a broom in his hand. Quiet? Ha! 3|c ^ ^ ^ Now that all this business about an Honor System has final ly broken out of the talk stage, more of the students are begin ning to stop ------- and think. There are many things to be said for and against it. Let's hear some of them in Letters to the Editor."

Delta Upsilon is in second place This is a spot they have held almost the entire year, although they did lead briefly and were in third place for a short time after basketball. They are defending champs in both track and softball and on the strength of past performances should finish strong. Sigs Third Sigma Chi is third and has also been among the first three for the greater part of the year. They also are' strong m the Spring and if they can better last year's second places in either golf or volleyball, may cause trouble. Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Lambda Chi Alpha, fourth and fifth, will pos sibly have the roughest time staying among the leaders. Last year, in the Spring, they were not as strong as the other contenders. However, in other sports this year they have surprised and could show further unexpected strength. Phi Psi Surge Phi Kappa Psi seems in best shape to better its position. La'st year they won volleyball and scored more points m the Spring than any other fratern al^' This year, they are showing a similar trend towards a late spurt.

Netmen Open Campaign On Tour;,
Diamondmen Prepare For Opener,"by Jack Gamble Hank Peter's netmen rang up the curtain on the 1951 Spring Sports schedule meeting Navy on Wednes day and George Washington Univer sity yesterday. They are currently on the last leg of their three day inaugural meeting the University of Maryland this afternoon at College Park. Not much information is available on the Middies squad but Bison fans can rest assured that the Herd was meeting a !tough and fighting outfit in the service team. The Buff and Blue Colonials of GW are currently boasting a record of four wins and two losses. That was before the Herd hit town. Only the morning papers can tell the rest of the story. The GW netmen have decisions over Citadel, College of Charleston, Wol ford, and Furman. Their two de feats were at the hands of Clemson and Presbyterian. Coach Doyle Royal's Terps, who are meeting the Herd at this very- hour, are making their initial ap pearance of the season. 2-1 To Match In their last meeting with these squads, the Hanksters garnered wins over only the District of Columbia netmen. Losing to Navy 9-0 the Herd bounced on the Colonials to turn out a 5-4 victory. The Terps were on their warm-up trial and squeezed out a similar 5-4 decision last season. In the number one slot for the Herd is the Jr. Davis Cup winner, Paul Remmey followed in the number two spot by captain Gray Rogers. Others making the trip are Bill Reitz, j Nick Schloeder, Alan Goff, John Hess.'"

PHILIP,
MORRIS,"by Ellwood Rowe Thanks to a little cooperation given him by the ""weather man,"" in the form of warm, fair weather with the mercury hovering between the 40 and 60 mark, Bill Lane was able to take his baseball charges outside last Tues day for the first time. Daily work outs in earnest are now being held on the diamond whenever possible, for the time is growing short until the season's opener only one week from tomorrow. Further Cuts The original complement of 40 can didates has now been cut to 25. Those still in the running for positions on the varsity nine include four catchers, seven pitchers, seven infielders, and seven flychasers. Even further cuts in the squad will be made until Lane has narrowed the team down to fifteen men who will comprise the 1951 edi tion of the Bison nine. The biggest problem facing the dia mond tutor this spring is in the pitch ing department. Here Coach Lane is 1 confronted with the difficult task of finding three capable pitchers to re place those lost from last year's club. Only chucker around from last year is Dick Roush around whom the hurl ing corps will be built according to word given out by Lane. Infield Strong The Orange and Blue tossers appear to be strong at all other positions, particularly so around the inner de fenses, where three returning veterans have already nailed down starting berths. Only unoccupied post to be filled in the infield at the present is the keystone !SSack, held down last sea- Ison by several different men with noi regular tending the duties there for the entire season. Final cuts in the squad will be made over the weekend, and uniforms will then be issued to all those men win ning berths on the varsity squad. The opening tilt is April 7 at home with Susquehanna U. proriding the opposi tion. Both teams have been hamper ed in their pre-season drills by the cold weather so that both clubs should enter the fray on fairly even terms."

One sophomore I and two freshmen managers are SS needed. f PKP, SAE Win Two Phi Psi and S. A. E. were the only houses to win two individual champ ionships. Joe Ortlieb winning the 145-pound title, and heavyweight Karl Heininger were the two Phi Psi cham pions, while Tom Ramage and Hugh Worthen prevailed over the 125 and 130-pound classes respectively for the S. A. E.'s. Theta Chi's Bill Oliver smashed his way to the 175-pound throne, and this victory, coupled with I a strong Theta Chi showing in pre liminary and semi-final bouts, was sufficient to push that fraternity into the crowded first place position. Closely behind in the scoring was Lambda Chi Alpha, totaling 34 points by virtue of Fred Cloud's victory in the 155-pound division plus a pair of finalists in Dick and Tom McMahon. Ramage Wins In the 125-pound final Ramage won a decisive victory over Ron Wetzel of Delta Upsilon. Ramage, who was benefited by a longer arm reach, took advantage of this asset and was the constant aggressor throughout the fight. Worthen scored a closer decision over Tom McMahon in the 130-pound division to give the S. A. E.'s an early lead in the scoring race. Meeting a setback similar to his brother's defeat, Dick McMahon was unable to cope with the fast punches thrown by Roy Cunningham in the 136-pound final. The well-conditioned Cunningham gradually wore his op ponent down with strong flurries dur ing the in-fighting to acquire the 136- pound title for Tau Kappa Epsilon. Ortlieb Triumphs Representing Phi Kappa Psi, lanky Joe Ortlieb boxed his way to a clear cut win over Don Kelso of K. D. R. in the 145-pound class. After a scintil lating victory over Phi Gamma Del ta's Joe Whipple in the semi-finals, Ortlieb came back strongly in the finals with his ever-changing style to annex the 145-pound crown. In the 155-pound section, Lambda Chi's Cloud outlasted Don York in one of the closest bouts o f the tourna- # ment- Slugging it out for all three rounds, Cloud's stronger finish over the tiring York gave him the hard- earned championship. The 165-pound title match saw Gregg Bowen triumph over John Rhoads of Theta Chi to give Kappa Sigma its lone championship. Bowen's"

Oliver Wins 175 Perhaps one of the most outstand ing fights in the entire tournament took place in the 175-pound class be tween Bill Oliver of Theta Chi and Delta Upsilon's Jim Stanton, which saw the masterful Oliver come out on top. Fighting his fourth bout in as many days, Oliver was splendidly con ditioned for his marathon stint, as he turned in a true championship brand of boxing as well as slugging. Phi Kappa Psi's Karl Heininger es tablished himself as the only repeating champion of the tourney, wading though the unlimited class with a skillful exhibition of power boxing, Heininger in his freshman year cap tured the 175-pound diadem, and af ter a year's absence from the intra mural ring, returned to his champion ship form by scoring a title-winning decision over Kappa Sigma's Pete Diamandis, after scoring two previous T.

Decision Allowing Frosh,
To Play Varsity Sports,"by Bruce Swanger The decision to allow freshmen to participate in varsity intercollegiate competition highlighted the meeting of the Eastern College Athletic Con ference, held in the Hotel Biltmore, New York City, Tuesday, March 13. Humphreys Attends According to ""Al"" Humphreys, Bucknell's representative at the meet ing, the Conference voted to allow members to use freshmen on the var sity teams if total male undergrad uate enrollment is less than 1000 or if enrollment in the senior, junior and sophomore classes total less than 650. Humphreys wanted the three upper grade total to be fixed at 750, but this motion was voted down. It was estimated that approximate ly 40 per cent of the ninety-one mem bers would be affected by this new eligibility ruling. B. U. Over Limits Bucknell's present male freshman enrollment is 329, and the other grades total 986. The E. C. A. C. also endorsed the N. C. A. A. ban on televising of mem ber college football games. The decision to make freshmen eli gible for varsity sports was prompted by the decrease in college enrollment, due to the Korean War and the na tional emergency. Named All-Opponent Don Strassner and Joe Gallagher # | were both named to the Gettysburg i Bullet's All-Opponent basketball j team recently. Strassner had the \ distinction of being selected unani- j mously as was George Davidson of ! Lafayette. Bucknell was the only = team to place two men on the first [ team."

(Continued from page 2.) them occupied ? It's nice to talk about a high faculty-student ratio and it's nice to have lots of free time for research, recreation and self develop ment, but the amount of that which a small private institution such as Buck nell can afford is very limited. Petitions may be gratifying things to the persons for whose supposed benefit they are written, but in a case such as this they are in bad taste. As I mentioned before, I was released 18 years ago when the finances of the University were at an extremely low ebb. Consequently, I had no cause to question the necessity of the action and, when a group of my students ask ed to present a petition iii my behalf, I thanked them from the bottom of my heart, but explained to them why it was not wise or proper. I believe that the sensible, clear thinking and experienced members of our faculty and student body will real ize and agree that President Hildreth is the one who is charged with the responsibility of keeping Bucknell a solvent and going concern. He is the one who will be blamed if disaster strikes because of inadequate plan ning and foresight. If he needs our council and advice he will ask for it, and we should not force it on him. I have no "" axe to grind"" and no promotion to look forward to, so my motive in writing this should not be open to obvious question. I have been inclined to criticize some of the acts or omissions of the administra tion myself, and I still am, but ------ any sensible student or faculty member should realize that we have a leader with a vast and valuable experience, with a strong sense of responsibility, and with ""guts"" enough to say and do what he thinks is best for Bucknell even though it does not meet with popular approval. That, alone, is rather unusual these days and, by it self, puts him up several notches in my estimation. Dismissing employ ees, particularly good ones, is a diffi cult and unpleasant task and I'm sure he doesn't like it. From an engineer's standpoint it would seem that it was time the students, as well as faculty members, face realities, get solidly be hind him to push, and not, to stab him in the back. Maybe he'd like to know we're with him all the way, as I be lieve most of us are. How about it? Very truly yours, John B. Miller Professor"

NUMBER 22.,
Harvard And Vassar Profs To,
Give Marriage Conclave Talks,"""Where is the American Family going now"" is the topic to be discussed at the Marriage Conference being held here April 7 and 8, Guest speakers at this conference will be Professor Carl C. Zimmerman of Harvard and Profes sor Joseph Kirk Folsom of Vassar. ifo ------------ ---- ------------------------------------ This conference, on a subject _ _ sociological and religious importance to everyone, is sponsored by the So ciology Department, the Christian Association, the Lecture Series, the Bucknell Wives' Association, and the Baptist Student Fellowship. During the conference, discussions will be held concerning the religious and social history of the family, the problems of the family, family be havior, and the veteran and his prob lems. The concluding session will attempt to reach a decision concern ing the future of the family. Professor Zimmerman believes the American family has reached the stage of disintegration which pre- ceeds the collapse of civilization. He illustrates his views with historical examples. He suggests, as remedies, increasing the size of the family and reviving the family spirit particularly among the learned classes. Opposing Professor Zimmerman is Professor Folsom. He thinks the family is too important a group to disintegrate. It has always existed and will continue to exist. Professor Folsom says the American family is taking an independent form which is dictated by the advanced society we live in. He believes that a lack of dependence for economical reasons will lead to deeper love within the family. A highlight of the conference will be a retreat at Cowan Saturday af ternoon devoted to recreation. Fol lowing supper, there will be a chance to discuss questions in an informal session. Everyone wishing to attend the retreat should register at the C. A. office by noon on Friday, April 7.

HAZING POLL FINDS,
FR0SH-S0PH SCRAP,
EVENT MOST MISSED,"In a hazing poll recently taken here, the main thing felt to be leaking in the Freshman program was the Frosh-Soph Scrap, and enforcements other than social pressure upon the Bucknell greenhorn. Two hundred and sixty-eight of the Frosh, out of 317 voting, expected hazing when they arrived. Over 190 were disappointed with the system. Out of 616 upperclassmen voting, 545 ""enjoyed"" their hazing, while 71 did not. Feeling it added a great deal to the school spirit, 571 opposed 45 who did not favor hazing. The S. F. C. committee working on this problem presented these results to the S. F. C., and then drew up a modified list of hazing rules with some milder forms of enforcement behind them. These modifications will be presented to the faculty for approval and then to the S. F-. C. Results of the poll prove that most upperclassmen who h a v e g o n e through hazing feel that it is benefi cial."

MEASLES HIT CAMPUS,
David Shinn And Ernest Kessler,
Enter Regional Debate Tourney,"Dave Shinn and Ernie Kessler will represent Bucknell at a regional debate tournament at Penn State tomorrow and Saturday. Many of the finest col legiate debate squads from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Jersey, Mary land, Delaware, the District of Columbia, and Virginia will participate. to Penn State and will act as one of the tournament judges. Today the Bucknell debaters are continuing their activities with atrip to Messiah College in Grantham, Pa. A1 Goff and Dick Wentley will uphold the affirmative of the national ques tion, while Don Stevenson and Jim Justice will defend the negative. On Sunday two other Bucknell de bate squads will leave for the annual spring trip to New England, where eight intercollegiate debates have been scheduled with four schools. On Sunday night the Bucknell men will be at the University of Connecticut The four schools with the highest ratings will represent this region at the annual national tournament at West Point on April 19, 20, and 21. Each participating school at Penn State sends a two man team which must be prepared to debate both sides of the national question. Shinn and Kessler, the Bucknell en tries, were the high men of the two Bucknell squads which last month placed fourth in the tournament of the Debate Association of Pennsyl vania Colleges held at Temple in Philadelphia. Professor Merritt, the debate coach, will accompany the men This change in Navy policy result ed from the Selective Service Direc tor's announcement giving the local service boards authority to postpone the induction of all high school and college students who are presently on a statuary postponement until the end of the current academic year, for an additional thirty day period so that they may enlist in the branch of the Armed Forces they prefer. Those affected by the above policy are: 1. Those secondary school grad uates who* have received prior to graduation their notice to report for pre-induction physical and mental examination, but who have not yet received their orders to report for induction. 2. Those secondary school grad uates who have received their orders to report for induction and who have had these orders cancelled for the purpose of enlistment in the service of their choice. 3. At the end of the current aca demic year, those college students or graduates who have received, prior to; the end of the current academic year, their notice to report for pre-induc tion examinations, but who have not yet received their orders to report j or induction. 4. At the end of the current aca demic year, those college students or graduates who have received their orders to report for induction and who have had these orders cancelled for the purpose of enlisting in the service of their choice. Applicants not coming under one of the four categpries outlined above, are still prohibited from enlisting in the Navy if they have received no tice to report for pre-induction phy sical. Students under educational deferr- ment, upon applying for enlistment in the Navy, must show that they have had orders for induction can celled. This is achieved by individ ual request to their local selective service board. Under this new policy students may submit their applications for enlist ment in the Navy now, and if found fully qualified will have their names placed on a waiting list. Actual enlistment must be within the Navy's allowed quota and will not be effected until the end of the school year. The Navy has taken this action to encourage students to remain in school and afford them an opportun ity to volunteer for the service of their choice prior to the expiration of their induction postponement. A new fad has hit the Bucknell campus! No, it's not walking on crutches or sporting new white bucks. It's MEASLES! At the present time ten boys are having a vacation at the men's in firmary, while only four girls inhabit the women's infirmary. Which is the weaker sex? But worse still, two members of the women's glee club who are afflicted with the nteasles are spending the tour at private homes. Symptoms Those students who haven't been touched by this malady inspect their faces and tummies at regular inter vals for signs of the much-dreaded red spots, since the appearance of the rash and a grippish feeling are about the only symptoms of measles. Luck ily enough, the current epidemic is of the German variety that lasts only a few days, but, unluckily, this type can be contracted more than once. Become A Hermit There isn't much anyone can do to prevent himself from getting measles, except to become a hermit tempor arily. If he does come in contact with the germ, the best thing to do is to get lots of sleep and eat the proper food. Maybe measles wouldn't be so bad. At least they would give you a vaca tion from classes plus plenty of sleep. It sounds like a pleasant vacation-- days of sleeping and scratching--but, as someone commented, ""Who has time for that?"""

Norway Now Available,The Norwegian committee of the Summer School for American Stu dents at the University of Oslo an nounces that four scholarships worth approximately $350 each will be made available to Amercan and Canadian students. The awards are to be known as the Ralph Bunche Scholar ships. The scholarships will given stu dents on the basis of merit by the Association of Electro-Chemical and Electro-Metallurgical Industries of Norway in honor of Dr. Bunche who was recently presented the Nobel Prize.

Fellowships In Germany,
Open To New Graduates,"Two new fellowship opportunities for American graduate students, for a year's study in West Germany, were announced today by the Insti tute of International Education, 2 West 45th Street, New York City. Made available by the Deutsche Aka- demische Austauschdienst, in Bonn, Germany, the fellowships are open to both men and women for study dur ing the academic year November 1, 1951--July 31, 1952. (Continued on page 8.) the 1,000 examination centers set up in to determine the deferment of college are scheduled here for May 26, June 16 1 President Truman has approved draft deferment for college students of superior scholastic standing or those achieving a high score on this aptitude test. In an executive order amending the Selective Service regulations, the President authorized Maj. Gem Lewis B. Hershey, Selective Service Direc tor, to prescribe the levels of college grades or the scores of the aptitude test that may qualify a college stu dent's activity as "" necessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety or interest."" Contact Local Boards The Selective Service System said draft boards will not have the test application cards until April 12. Local boards throughout the nation already are being flooded with re quests for the cafda, a selective ser vice spokesman said. In announcing recently that stu dents wishing to take the tests should apply to their draft boards immedi ately, the agency neglected to explain that it meant immediately upon dis tribution of application cards to the boards April 12. The student can indicate the date on which he would like to take the test--May 26, June 16 or June 30-- and the place. After the-form is fill ed out, the registrant must mail it to the Selective Service examining sec tion. The Educational Testing Service of Princeton, N. J., then will assign the date and place where a student will take the test and return half of the card to the registrant. He must take the card with him when he takes the test. The service will follow the student's wishes as far as possible on time and place for the test. To Be Fingerprinted Each applicant will be fingerprinted to make sure that only authorized per sons take the test, which will be in the form of multiple-choice questions. Anyone caught cheating will be dis missed from the examination immedi ately. The tests will include mathematical problems and the reading of passages, charts and tables to see how students apply general principles. They are designed to determine ability to learn rather than actual knowledge. Draft officials have indicated that the aptitude test might have a con- (Continued on page 8.)"
Morale Of College Students Is At,
Low Ebb According To Study Group,"""The morale of college students year due to the frustration, threat, and al and Korean War."" That was the statement recently of the dean of students of the Univer sity of Colorado, Clifford Houston, reporting to a study group at the sixth annual conference on higher education. The conference is sponsored by the department of higher education of the national education association, and is attended by some 1,000 dele gates from 46 states. The meeting ends tomorrow. Houston said that uncertainties re garding the future resulted in lower grades for men who remained in col lege. 'Stealing and other anti-social has dropped during the current school anxiety connected with the internation- I manifestations of behavior increas- I ed,"" he declared. ""The number of discipline cases shot up. Students spent much time in talking about military occupations and the chance of 'getting what you want if you en list' as compared to doing something you do not like if drafted."" Houston added that recent an nouncements by selective service ""are beginning to clarify the situation."" ""The future job of faculty person nel will be increasingly to help stu dents make adjustments to relative certainties with regard to the draft,"" he declared. Sii !"

Grand Old Coalition,
(E olu rnn,
"Now is the time, to butcher a phrase, for every man to come",
to the aid of his coalition.,
For the benefit of the unsuspecting,
freshmen and reluctant sophomores perhaps we'd better elaborate,
on this a little bit.,
"Coalitions, you see, are the way we at Bucknell go about get",
ting people--the right People--elected to the various class offices,
when Spring elections come around.,
It's a practically fool proof,
method whereby various groups put Petty issues like intramural,
athletics temporarily aside to vote a complete slate put up by the,
coalition to insure themselves against being left out in the cold.,
Now are there any questions.,
One at a time please.,
"First,",
the young man with the melting ice cream cone.,
Do coalitions,
"always work, you ask.",
"The answer, happily, is yes, almost al",
ways.,
"And now . . . (go 'way, kid, beat it) . . . are there any",
more questions.,
I think the little girl with the twisted stockings,
has her hand raised.,
W hat's that?,
Does the coalition system,
guarantee a true representation?,
The answer is . . . (g'wan,
"beat it; hey, Mike, get this kid outa here) . . .  as I was saying:",
ab-so-lutely.,
Everybody makes out.,
"So you see . .. . all right, kid, all right.",
If I answer your,
question will you promise to stop scaring the people.,
What's,
Doesn't that mean that people will be voting for People,
that?,
"they don't even know or think will do a good job, you ask?",
"We-e-e-1-1, yes, as long as you want to force the point.",
Things like that will happen every once in awhile.,
But that's,
a minor point when a thing like this is at stake. Besides an office,
isn't that important anyway.,
It just helps fill up that space,
under your name in,
L 'Agenda.,
But enough of these trivialities.,
Go. Study your candidates,
and their qualifications w ell,
------------,
then go out and vote like,
you're told to.,
Good News For Draft Bait,
If the students need any other indication that this country is,
"jnaking an elite corps out of the nation's college students, a look",
at the front page of any newspaper will give it to them.,
While debate rambles through Congress over whether the,
not-so-fortunates should be drafted at 18 or,
18*A,
"years of age,",
plans are being made to give our boys in white bucks an examin,
ation to determine whether they go at all.,
How do we rate it?,
It's probably just as well we didn't ask,
that question right now.,
The logical move is towards the books.,
Off The Editorial Cuff,
Our reporter covering Guy Payne's tells us that the patrons,
are beginning to eat off the floor since the tables are slightly less,
than clean.,
One math major counted 18 separate items on one,
of the back room tables.,
Although we seriously doubt the story,
that some table items date back to '09 we do think that Guy,
Payne's could be a little cleaner.,
It isn't that the customers are,
"fussy, but when the cake crumbs begin to walk around the time",
for action has come.,* * * * *
It was especially gratifying to notice the interest shown by,
the Inter-Fraternity Council in the prospective variety show,
mentioned in these columns last week for presentation on an in,
tercollegiate television series in New York next Fall.,* * * *
Saturday's baseball bill starts the beginning of a new season,
in another sport and another chance for Bucknellians to support,
one of their teams.,

To The Editor: There has been considerable discus sion in the past weeks regarding the information of coalitions for the pur pose of electing campus officers. This has come to the front in this weeks Editorial. Because of the example used, it is obvious that the author is completely unfamiliar with the reali ty of the matter. Considering the possibility that other students may also have a misconception, we would like to explain the purpose and poli cies of such an organization. First, let us consider how those or ganizations select their candidates. This process is very similar to the one used by our national political parties. Specifically, delegates from various campus groups submit the names- of their outstanding individ uals in each class. This group ob jectively discusses the candidates on the. basis of leadership, scholarship, and popularity. The slate is then adopted composed of the most quali fied persons. In this way the group acts the same as the Nominating Committee of the Student Faculty Congress, and in many cases the se lections are identical. At this time the selected candidates are informed, and the responsibility of their cam paign is carried by themselves and their friends. The reference made to the dicta torial methods used by these organi zations is extremely erroneous. No attempt has even been or conceivably ever will be made to influence as sug gested by the Editorial. Persuasion is only in the form of getting indi viduals to vote, and absolutely no at tempt is made to force a vote con trary to personal beliefs. However, the worth of the candidates on the slate is stressed. Former success has been achieved wholly as a result of the merits and popularity of the candidates. How else would a minority gain fhese re sults ? The * group receiving the greatest criticism embodies only 25.8% of the Freshman Class, 29.6% of the Sophomore Class, 28.8% of the Junior Class, and 27.2% of the total enrollment. Assuming. they vote as a bloc, and they definitely do not, it is statistically obvious that success is only based upon the qualities of the individual candidate. Contrary to common belief Buck nell does not have a one party system. Four organized groups have submit ted petitions. The Fraternal groups referred to so frequently are smaller in numbers than the Independent coalition. This has been an attempt to clarify the misconceptions and undue criti-"
S C H L 0 0  A  S C H M 00?,"April 1, 1951 Dear Editor, I would like to know what are the criteria for evaluating the latest hit tunes used by Mr. Schloo in his col umn, ""As The Cat Sees Them""?"
I,"doubt if this self-styled, pseudo ""music critic"" uses any set of stand ards, thus forcing himself to rely on his own ""good judgment."" In addition, Mr. Schloo himself re sorts to vulgarisms in describing a band leader's style and orchestration. An outstanding example is noted in the March 15 issue of the Bucknell- ian, in which the ""Cat"" comments that Ray Anthony's style is ""still a bastardized Miller'. Mr. Schloo also uses words from his private vocabu lary when he writes of concerts which are ""classicalish"". A final example of our critic's ""good English"" is found in his remark about Charlie Ventura, who has ""junked his ork for a combo"". These illustrations could go on for ever. In my opinion, the contents of the entire column indicate what kind of a sehmoo Schloo is. Many others join me in requesting a change in ""the Cat's"" tune, in order that his ""interested readers"" may enjoy the worthwhile and unbiased music re- j views. Sincerely, Audrey Howard Ed's Note: We should probably re mind our readers that the comments and grammar of music critic Schloo (pronounced Schloo) must not be in terpreted to reflect the opinions of the BUCKNELLIAN or the standards of the English department. cisms directed toward the so called coalitions. Instead of being an evil force, they are a definite attribute in that they create tremendous enthusi asm, enhance the spirit of friendly rivalry, make possible the selection of well qualified candidates, and in short provide to the campus that much needed ""Bucknell Spirit."" A Bucknell Political Party Ed.'s Note: That-this letter refers to matters not covered or discussed in the editorial (Grand Old Coalition) is explained by the fact that it was writ ten without having seen the editorial. That this was done in an hour of panic is obvious, but other aspects are less clear. If this is ""a Bucknell political party , what is its name? Answer: There is none..... If this is a political party why doesn't it campaign as such? Answer: We would rather stay in the background. We submit that the authors are confused between the terms ""party"" and ""machine"" (Poli. Sci. 104). We do not condemn political parties openly acting as such. 5-14221 H a rris H a ll re ce p tio n ist desk [ Adviser, Prof. Robert M. Ewing."

Approval Of Honor System Is,
Seen In Results Of Sosh Club Poll,"A few weeks ago, a poll was taken of a representative sample of Buck- nell students by the Sociology Club. The purpose? To discover whether or not Bucknellians felt that the academic honor system would work on campus. One hundred and forty-eight stu-deg- dents answered the various questions on the Sociology Club poll. These student's names were obtained from applying a list of random digits to the total student enrollment of under graduates, and various checks proved the representativeness of the sample. The two main questions asked on the poll were, ""Do you approve or disapprove of an Honor System for Bucknell,"" and, ""What are your rea sons for approval or disapproval?"" The ""Honor System"" was defined as follows: 1. No proctoring of exam inations; 2. Student reporting of stu dent infractions; 3. A student ""honor council"" which would have the power to recommend expulsion for proven infractions. The results of the po in terms of percentages of the total student body, the men and women and the four classes show the senti ments of Bucknellian towards the Honor System.

Fraternities Inaugurate Freedom,
With Gala Weekend Celebrations,"Sunday. Things are ominously silent on the hill. Birds sing, and the squirrels frolic. But not a sign of human life. What happened? The fra ternities are off social pro. As all the Sunday morning head- ache-nursers can attest, the above statement is all too true. It was a long weekend. Of course for the Thursday night Barney fans, it was unusually long, but it started official ly on Friday night. The Phi Psi's and F iji's held their annual Jeff Duo. The S. P. E.'s held their 'Bowery Brawl', with much of the decoratif motive revolving around a downtown bar. The D. U.'s held a gangster-style dance, and they called it, oddly enough, the 'Gangster's Get Together.'"

Veteran Hurler To Pace Lanemen,
In Inaugural At Mathewson Field,"by Ellwood Rowe Intercollegiate competition on the spring sports card makes its home debut Saturday afternoon on Christy Mathewson Memorial Field as the base ball squad tangles with Susquehanna University. The tilt is the first of ten home affairs to be staged by the Lanemen this year. Roush Starting Probable starting lineup for the Orange and Blue as released today by Coach Bill Lane includes six vet erans from last year's MAC champ ionship team. Dick Roush, who com piled a five and one record last spring, is a sure starter on the mound, with Bretz and Lucas being held in relief. Receiving Roush's deliveries will be either Bob Albert or Jim Guiseppi. Around the inner garden three let- termen will be in the starting lineup at the umpire's first cry of ""play ball"". At first base Marty McKibbin is slated to start. The left side of the infield will be intact from the past season as Andy Shirk, captain, and Jackie Weber will hold down the third base and shortstop positions re spectively. Art Long has been nom inated by Lane to fill the bill at the keystone sack. Outfield Battle Still battling for the left field berth are Mai Sinclair, holdover from last year, and Brad Myers, fleet sopho more from Lancaster. Centerfield will be patrolled by newcomer Abe Powellson, and right field will, again be well tended by capable Bill Franke. Reports from the Crusader camp point toward a strong veteran outfit with six starters from last year's ag gregation, which edged out the Herd 4-3 in ten innings, around again this year. Ed Menapace, hard hitting veteran catcher, will be behind the plate to handle the offerings of Ray Kaseman, who will be on the firing line for the invaders. Vets Pace S. U. The S. U. infield can boast seasoned campaigners in Chet Rowe, third sacker; Ed Wollaston, shortstop; Ken Orris, second base. A quick plance at the outer gardens reveals return ing lettermen in the form of Gene Fenstermacher and Don Meringer with rookie Rich Young completing the outfield trio. Susquehanna got the jump on the Bisons yesterday by meeting Swarth- more in Philadelphia. With one game under their belts, the charges of Coach Bob Bastress promise to be a tough oe for the Orange and Blue tossers to hurdle. Considering all angles, a tight battle all the way is forecast. A good-sized crowd is ex pected to turn out to witness the opener for the Herd as they attempt to gain revenge for last season's set back."

Ostendarp Returns To Studies,
After Successful Pro Campaign,"by Bob Hunter From fame as a Bucknell gridder to success with the pros--that has been the course of Jim ""Smokey"" Ostendarp, halfback with the New York Giants. Smokey, as his friends and supporters all know him, is back at BU after taking a semester's leave to play big' league professional foot ball. In addition to completing his studies in education, Smokey, a senior, is assisting his former mentor, Harry Lawrence, by coaching the backs dur ing spring training. Follows Lawrence It seems that Smokey's entire career is connected with Harry, whom he idolizes, ever since he played high school football in his home town of Baltimore, Maryland. Smokey, whose 5' 8"", 175 pound frame isn't very sizable according to pro standards, was even smaller back in those days, weighing only about 145. Being told he was too small to play scholastic ball, Jim chose an engineering high school and played sandlot football on the side. Here was where he first came into contact with Harry Lawr ence, who's winning high school teams were the talk of Maryland. Harry, recognizing Smokey's potentialities as a stellar back, asked him if he would like to play some high school ball his senior year, which is exactly what the future Bison star did. However, he played not for Harry's school, but for his present institution, who upon Lawrence's observations, quickly ask ed Smokey to stay where he was and play football. He made the first string and was named a quarterback on the All-State squad. All-Service Selection After a year at Maryland, Smokey enlisted in the paratroops and served for three years.,He played football in Europe, and was selected to the All- 7th Army team. However, he shat tered his shoulder in a parachute jump, and was honorably discharged. Back home again, Smokey decided to forget about football and take up engineering at Drexel. But he could not get the sport out of his blood and was back in action in the fall of 1946. Upon learning that Harry Lawrence was to be the new Bucknell coach, Smokey got together with him and decided to transfer to BU, and change his course to education And so, the next season found Smokey Ostendarp leading the Bison Freshman to a season of five wins in six tries. The following year he was hit by the flu early in the season, and like the rest of the team, never quite got started. As most of us know, it was during the 1949 season that Smokey displayed the sparkling abil ity of which he was capable. The speedy, hard-running halfback was ranked third among the ball carriers in the east, and was named on both the Little All-America team and the second All-Pennsylvania squad. His team's fortunes shot up, also, for the Thundering Herd won six out of eight that year, dropping two one-point decisions. Trys Pros Being declared ineligible after his junior year, because of his season at Drexel, Smokey chose to try out for the Giants. He also received offers j from the Philadelphia Eagles, Chicago Bears, and the now-dissolved Balti more Colts. He played in most of the Giant games, mainly as a defen sive back. On his first play from (Continued on page 5.)"
Divotmen Prepare For Inaugural;,
Evans Announces Course In Shape,"by Jack Waldron The golf team, highlighted by four returning' regulars, will open its 1951 season against Dickinson College on April 16, at Carlisle. Coach Harold Evans* team thus far consists of the four veterans: Bill Allen, Russ Long, Ben Hoffman, and Van Johnson. Vie- ing for the remaining four positions are: Art Goding, Bob Watkins, Ted Stark, Bill Andrews, and Fred Mur- name. However, Coach Evans, would like it understood that these positions are wide open, and he would like to see more candidates out for the squad. New Foes This year's schedule sees two new opponents for the Bison golfers. They are Navy and Maryland. Other op ponents which should give the golfers trouble are: Penn State, Cornell, Get tysburg, and Juniata. Juniata is rated one of the better golf teams in small college ranks. , Anpther highlight of the season will be the Lehigh match, which will be played at the beautiful Saucon Valley links in Bethlehem where the Harold Evans, University Golf Course Pro, has announced that the course is now in excellent shape. The green fees are $1.50, per day, except Wednesdays, Saturdays, Sun days, and Holidays, when the fees are $2.25. A semester membership is $8.40, including tax, while a year membership is $12.00, including tax. Evans would like to point out that it is to the students economic advantage to own a semester or yearly member ship. The golf course offers students a good chance to relax and improve their game if they take advantage of the facilities this spring. IM Council Meeting Meeting of IM Council, Monday, April 9th, at 7:15 p. m., in Davis Gym. Each IM manager is re quested to take a poll as to whether his house prefers 9 or 10 men soft- ball. Also to be considered is the dates for softball and golf. National Amateur Invitation Tourna ment will be held in September."

PAGE FIVE,"by Harry Staley The footballers are at it again. Spring practice scrimmmages are the <<#der of the day and the liniment bottles are once more taking a beating ....... Next season's schedule has not been released due to the fact that Georgetown, previously on the slate, has dropped football"
......,"This leaves an empty slot on the Bison schedule which A1 Humphreys is trying to fill ....... Negotiations with Rutgers were stymied when the Jerseyites found it impossible to rearrange their schedule ....... With the one unknown quantity, the 1951 card will feature the same opponents as last season. Ye olde Sports Ed hereby pleads guilty to a charge of slipping up on one of the weeks biggest stories, from a B. U. standpoint ....... Apologies are hereby extended Bucky' Strassner and Joe Gallagher for failing to mention that both men were recently named to the All-State basketball team ....... Strassner gained a berth on the second team while Gallagher received, an honorable mention ....... Strassner's feat was even more remarkable since he played much of the season on one leg ....... Once again, Congrats. Bill Lane probably faces his biggest problem of strategy before the baseball season starts"
......,"The diamond mentor is plagued with the problem of deciding who must go from his group of varsity candidates...' .... Only 15 men will be carried and the last cut promises to be a tough decision for Lane ....... Undoubtedly the result of the financial situation, the forced cut will leave the <<quad with only 6 replacements"
......,"However, the squad is out to make the best of the situation and their first chance will come Saturday against Sus- quehanna here. Three losses already grace the record of the tennismen but team mem bers point out that they are learning a lot of tennis ....... Hank Peters, no be liever in ""patsy"" schedules, has arranged a tough season for the team ....... He has also taken pains to pit the team against some of the better individual stars in the amateur field ....... The tennis team will make their first home appearance this Tuesday afternoon against F. & M. There are those who will hold that bridge cannot be considered a sport, bat Bucknell will be represented in the Intercollegiate Bridge Tourney Finals largely through the efforts of three people.......Jerry Olds and Chuck Rogers deserve credit for winning the regional championship and gaining the national finals, but credit for creating local interest goes to Mrs. Blair, housemother at Walker House ....... Largely through her efforts the school will be represented in Chicago."

Tennismen Three Time Losers In,
Unsuccessful Dixieland Invasion,"by Bruce Swanger The tennis team opened their season last week when they traveled south of the Mason-Dixon line to bow in three straight matches to southern competi- tioh. Navy Scuttles : Navy scuttled them 9-0, Wednesday at Annapolis; George Washington eked out a 5-4 verdict, Thursday at Washington, D. C., and the Maryland Terps finished the job by taking a 7-2 decision at Baltimore', Saturday. In the opening match of the south ern series, the Orange and Blue rae- queteers were pitted against a strong Navy team that had little trouble in ciphering the Bison netmen. Paul Remmey, Bucknell's number one man and former Middle States Junior Davis Cup winner, was the only man to. offer serious competition to his Middie opponent, Remmey dropped the first set 6-0, but extended the second before succumbing 8-6. No match went beyond two sets, with only one, except Remmey's, going be yond six games. G. K. Triumphs After leaving Annapolis, the tennis men moved into the Nation's Capitol to engage George Washington Uni versity. Finding the opposition a little less difficult, Remmey, Rogers and Reitz jumped into a quick 3-0 lead. This was dissipated, however, as the next three men lost. Remmey and Reitz collaborated in the first doubles to annex the other point. Final score: G. W. 5, B. U. 4. The final match took the netmen to College Park, Baltimore, where the Bisons lost to a good University of Maryland team, 7-2. Remmey gar nered the first Bison tally by taking two straight sets from his Terp op ponent, 6-4 and 6-1. Goff, Rogers, Reitz, Hess and Schloeder lost the next five before Remmey and Rogers joined to pick up the second point in"

Peters Queried When queried regarding the games, Coach Henry Peters only comment was ""Too much south."" His belief in southern hospitality was undeniably shaken, but his respect for their ten nis teams was evident. According to ""Hank"" the Navy team, borrowing an idea from their football brothers, have a modified platoon system. If an accident should befall one of the members, there is another of equal ability waiting to step into the lineup. The boys from south of the border have had the benefit of better prac tice weather, while the Bucknell team has had to work out in Lewisburg's semi-winter temperature. George Washington also played six games prior to their match with the Bisons. The next game on the schedule is Tuesday, April 10, when the netmen play host to the F. & M. Diplomats."

Gridders Continue Outdoor Drills;,
"Point For State, F&M Scrimmages","by Dick Shaw Spring football practice went into full swing last week when uniforms were issued and outdoor work began. A total of almost 40 candidates are striving for varsity positions next year. 12 Backs Out The present squad is composed of juniors, sophomores and freshmen of which twelve are backfield men and the remainder linemen. Prior to full scale practice, indoor sessions were held in Davis Gym for two weeks to acquaint freshmen with Coach Lawrence's version of the Split-T. Movies of last year's games were shown and analyzed. Following a week of flickers, the men ran through dummy plays and calisthen- tics until vacation. Teamwork Stressed With the other aspirants out, hard work has begun in earnest. Individ ual play and teamwork are being stressed with scrimmages being held almost every day. Coach Harry Lawrence is' handling the overall stra tegy. He is ably assisted by Herb Maack, working with the linemen, Jack Guy, supervising ends and ""Smokey"" Ostendarp, New York Giant football star, who is instructing the backgeld candidates. Practices are expected to run until the end of April or early in May. Bison fans will be able to get a pre view of next year's team when the spring gridmen scrimmage the F. & M. Diplomats at home in late April. State Scrimmage Another practice scrimmage is scheduled with Penn State at State College. Most positions with the exception of end, are well filled on the team. There is a shortage of end candidates. Coach Lawrence would be glad to see anyone interested in trying out for a flank job report for practice. Of course, this applies to anyone inter ested in playing ball. Although practices have been running for only a short while, the Herd mentor be lieves the men are working hard and things look good for next year. READ The Bucknellian."

The affair will get under way in Memorial Stadium at 2 o'clock when Lawrence will pair the Bison's squad for an intra-team scrimmage. After the group has seen the split- T in action, Lawrence and assistant coaches Herb Maack and Jack Guy will answer any and all questions about the system. Later, the guests will be shown football movies of the split-T under actual game conditions.

This time he was in a Giant uniform against the Balti more Colts. He played three-fourths of the game as his team came out on top. Small School Spirit Being one of two men on the Giant roster from a small school, and be cause of his size, Smokey was really 'up against it"" to make the team. He has for teammates such stars as Connerly from Mississippi, Swiacki of Columbia, Price of Tulane, Poole of Mississippi State, and Tidwell from Auburn. Also, the New Yorkers lost but two games all season! Smokey says he worked hard to make that team not only for his own sake, but to represent Bucknell in the profes sional ranks, and to prove that a small school may also carry on fine athletics as well as educational tra dition. Another former Bucknellian, Walter Zot is a lineman for the Pitts burgh Steelers. Smokey goes to training camp this July, and if he improves even more upon his rookie season, he should do well next fall. After his playing days are over, he hopes' to land a coaching job in one of the larger col leges. In fact, he may be a member of the staff of a large eastern school next fall."

PROF-FILES,
Professor John S. Gold,"by Bobbie Maurer John S. Gold, professor of mathematics and astronomy, is a native of these parts. He was born in the small town of Turbotville, a rural town about 15 miles from here. ' After attending the c o u n t r y school there, he came to Bucknell and graduated in 1918. Incidentally, he also took the same general science course that Dr. Rice referred to as the ""General Snip"" course. He also had chemistry under Professor Wil liam Schuyler in 1915. Taught High School Professor Gold taught high school for two years---one year in Milton High School and one in Towanda High School. He came here to teach in the fall of 1920 and has been here ever since--31 years. Receiving his masters degree in 1921 from Bucknell, he went on to do graduate work at the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago. When the junior college started at Wilkes- Barre, Professor Gold taught there for three years from 1933 to 1936. For some time, he taught both here and there, which necessitated travel ing there for 8:00 o clock classes three days a week--and to think we com plain about early classes right here. Gradually moving to more prominent positions in the catalogue over the years, Professor Gold is now profes sor of mathematics amd astronomy, and has been director of the Observa tory since 1927. When Professor Gold first started out in his education, he planned to teach in high school, specializing in mathematics. Upon graduating he found a teaching job in Bucknell. He remarked that once you start teach ing you can't stop, you get so inolved in the routine of it. He also stated that sometimes, holding class is a relaxation to him. In other words, after the committees and other or-"
Movie Chatter,"ganizations with which you become involved have taken your energy, the class work is a pleasure. Professor Gold has been the chair man of the Committee on Class Schedule since 1927, which is quite a job, especially at times like the burn ing of Old Main, when classes were destroyed. He is a past president of the Lewisburg Rotary Club, and pre viously served a term on the Lewis burg School Board. A member of the Evangelical and Reformed Church he had been an Elder, and was once county superintendent of the Sunday schools of Union County. Interested In Farming Professor Gold's outside interests center around farming. He owns a farm and runs it within certain limits. Though he does little of the actual farming himself, he can ""talk a good farm."" He also enjoys public speak ing, which he makes use of on various occasions. Though he is annoyed by detective stories in the lines of liter ature, historicals novels intrigue him."
Campus Quizzer,
Frosh Hazing Next Year?,"by Elaine Vouyoukas Should freshman ""hazing"" be re established next year? Now that thoughts of ""moving up day"" are coming into view, many of the prospective sophomores are con templating the initiation of next year's frosh class by various rites and ordeals before they can be con sidered true Bucknellians. Some students, upperclassmen and surpris ingly enough, some freshmen were rather disgusted with this year's lack of ""hazing."" However, some faint hearts, among them, your truly, were frankly glad! Holton Confer, Kappa Sig, doesn't have this fiendish desire to initiate new frosh. He said and. I quote: ""I sort of think we cduld do without hazing. I wouldn't like it, so I don't think they would either."" The supposedly compassionate and gentle (?) female members of the panel disagree. Joan Dudley is all for ""hazing."" She says: ""YES, more school spirit is needed. It gives everybody a chance to ""let their hair down."""
I,"thought the school spirit ' this year was lousy."" In a word, this fair miss says it was lousy-stinko, get it? Get on the ball, kiddies! Maybe additional ""hazing"" would help. Bob Bimbaum foom his lofty exalt ed position as a junior, gives his opinion. Because he never really went through hazing either, I asked him what he thought of the past two year of ""no hazing."" He reflected awhile, then said: ""If 'hazing' would further school spirit more than it has been the past couple years, all fine and dandy."" Elly Mendelson, however, is defi nitely against increased ""hazing."" ""NO, no, no! She says: 'Cuz it would cause a lot of unnecessary trouble. We're none the worse for not having it."" Hm-m-m-m. Can't say as we're any the better either. Nancie Keen an, who inhibits (ha) Stephens house, adds a reminiscent note. She says: ""The classes get to know each other better, and it gives you something to remember."" Which reminds me of that old song: ""Just Give Me Something To Remember You By."" (Like memoriz ing the entire Alma Mater) heh, heh! As the argument was pretty well divided, I'll let you judger for your- seves. As for my opinion, I think I'll play ""Mr. Inbetween""!"
Transfer Milly Martin Coaches,
May Day Modern Dance Group,"by Ann Rose Since it was founded, Bucknell has contributed many illustrious people Ur society, and once more a talented student has come here to study. She is Milly Martin, a senior transfer from the University of Maryland. Jacob's Dance Festival in Pittsfield, Mass., where the best dancers in the world go to practice in the summer. It was here that she worked under Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Dennis, and was the soloist for Martha Graham's company. However, she broke her pelvic bone and had to stop dancing for a year. She has had several of fers as choreographer for different shows after her graduation, and some day she plans to have a show of her Milly has many talents, but her main interest Is modern dancing and she certainly excels in this field. She has been in the companies of such celebraties as Martha Graham, Ted Shawn, and Ruth St. Dennis. Milly has been dancing ever since she was seven, and at the age of fif teen became one of Martha Graham's three apprentices at the Kings Smith School in Washington, D. C. After graduation from high school she at tended St. Mary's Jr. College and then transferred to the University of Maryland where she was a speech major Danced For Fred Waring She became a professional dancer at Maryland, and also began to do choreography with the dancers there. This is now her first interest, as she did all the choreography for Fred Waring's Christmas show this year, some for other TV shows, and also for the ballet theater. Last year she left school and travelled through all the southern and eastern states on a solo concert tour with her own group. 'This past summer she attended Swims, Too Besides her dancing, Milly is an ex cellent ballet swimmer. She was in Billy Rose's Aquacade for three Christmas shows, a teacher on the National Aquatic Staff, and was also a 1946 Olympic finalist for form swimming. She was a counselor at Camp Allegro in Pittsfield, teaching swimming and dancing, and now has her own water show at the Berkly Cartaret Hotel in Asbury Park, N. J. She also has her own dancing school in her home town of Red Bank, N. J.y where she teaches ballroom and mod ern dancing. by Babs Fiedler If you haven't already seen it, see ""Born Yesterday"" starring Judy Hil- liday and William Holden, which is coming to the Campus Thursday, Fri day and Saturday. As you already know it's about a not-so-dumb blond who makes good. It's clever, fast, and different, and netted Judy the Academy Award. * * * * At the Strand in Sunbury on Thurs day is ""Lightening Strikes Twice"" starring Ruth Roman and Richard Todd. Ruth falls in love with Dick, knowing that he is a murderer. Com plications ensue from here that make the picture look quite exciting. * * * Friday and Saturday at the Strand is ""Raton Pass"" mis-starring Dennis Morgan and Pat Neal. It is a story about the early w-i-i-i-ld west, in which Dennis, who used to be so tough, is played for a sucker by Pat, (Continued on page 7.)"

Unfortunately Doris's looks and voice and Gene's looks and dancing don't do a thing for the picture. Because the sad truth is that neither of them can act.

Some well meaning but silly looking friends try to hide this fact from the heroine (Doris, of course) is named correspondent in a divorce case.

(Next to Keeler's),"by Jim Hastings What's all this talk about Buck- nell's ""Second Century of Progress."" From the observation by your reporter it seemingly includes everything from the new Ellen Clarke Bertrand Li brary to the proposed plan for 'Chet's Study Halls'. Miracles never cease to happen! But hold everything, WVBU isn't to be outdone by these revolutionary ad vancements on campus, for your sta tion is considering membership in the International , Broadcasting System. When your reporter finds out about this proposal and its advantages in the near future, you can read the de- tails in this column. More Jam For Breakfast Many Bucknellians have requested that John Manbeck expand his ""Jam For Breakfast"" show to provide re- I axing"" entertainment while getting ready for those eight and nine o'clocks 3n Saturday. Johnnie's program every Monday through Friday at 7:30 I 'til 8:45 in the morning has proved so successful, that public opinion has in fluenced this ""eariy-to-bed, early-to- rise"" announcer to spin those discs each Saturday mom from 7:30 'til 10. The Dean, besides, received so many complaints from the profs about the snears we gave our instructors on Saturday morning, that your chief staff announcer couldn't refuse his duties in getting us into that ""Oh, How I Love To Get Up In The Morn ing,"" mood. Say, here's a new twist to an old story, ""Why not progress along with the rest of the campus and give a lis ten to Jack Gamble's Thursday night sports review program. Jack, with out fail, gives you the latest on Buck nell and national sports over 640 on your dial from 9:30 until 9:55. Bill Stem is finding difficulty in scheduling informal discussions with leading sports personalities, for Jack has managed to make arrangements with prominent sports stars, who by chance, happen to be Bucknellians."

Expect Big Convention,"by Sue Canan Louis Bouche, well known New York artist, opened a dynamic shdw in Roberts Hall last Sunday. His unusual portraits, landscapes and still lifes are quiet pictures, painted mostly in subtle tones of gray and blue with vivid figures V sharply sketched. There is a simplicity of line and humor in his characters. He is at his best in pictures like "" Myron Watkins, Post Master,"" a collection of assorted people on vacation at a small town post office. He catches the joy of life in summer cottages in ""Sum mer of 1945,"" "" Peppercombe Porch"" end ""Peppercombe Interior""--figures as relaxed sketches, and cool green trees above old houses. Figures Enliven Figures enliven all his landscapes and city scenes. In "" Winter Land scape"" the gray monotony of barren ground is broken by two little boys playing; in ""Parking Lot Cincinnati,"" two art students give definite inter est to commonplace rows of cars. Also an excellent painting is ""War Frieze"". There is power but no glamour in the massed khaki and blue 0 embarking soldiers. His still lifes have the magic of an ancient play room--blocks mixed with paint cans and old toy horses. All his art re- [ fleets his joy in life and painting. A big man, with a fascinating brush mustache and a cane, Mr. Bouche definitely reflected this joy of living in his informal talk. With his delightful humor he made some very 1 interesting points. According to Bouche, the greatest value in an ab stract painter like Jackson-Pollack is that he makes French artists curious, for the first time, about American art. A Thing To Enjoy Answering another question, Mr. Bouche stated that painting is a thing"

Only 964 of the entire student body voted for Student-Faculty Con gress officers, 265 out of a class of 461 voted for senior candidates, 243 out of 455 in the junior class, and 330 out of 552 voted in the sophomore class. Dick Brooks, new president of the Student-Faculty Congress is an SAE and captain of next year's varsity soccer team.

Margie Monzert Makes Debut,
As 'Mlle. Modiste' Chanteuse,"* Performances tonight, tomorrow night, Saturday night, and a matinee Saturday afternoon will culminate the University Player's production of the Victor Herbert operetta, 'Mile Modiste, featuring Margie Monzert."
vLlin,
IB utknvllmn,
BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY,"Margie Monzert "". . . captivating"" The presentation of the operetta will be at the Lewisburg High School, and the reserved seats will go at $1.25 per person with the exception of the matinee Saturday afternoon. The University Players consist of the combined talents of the Cap and Dagger, the Band, the Orchestra, the Men and Women's Glee Clubs, and the Modern Dance Group, producing one dramatic effort a year, this being the third. The first year they pro duced Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance, then Friml's Vagabond King, and their $1800 extravaganza this year promises to be the best yet. Script Rewritten Under the direction of Harvey Powers with Janie Brown as assistant director, the show was especially re written to take place in present-day Paris. Some Bucknellians may have seen a reworked 1904 version of Mile. Modiste on T. V. over mid-semester vacation, starring Fritzie Seheff, the original lead of the first poduction, but this was worked over to feature Miss Seheff, and in no way compares with the original to be presented by the Flayers. Runs Hatshop The story, with Margie Monzert in the lead, is centered around a Parisian hat shop, and features elaborate cos tumes, and props. Miss Monzert, a pert hatshop pro prietress, is the only one who dares stand up to the count, captivating him and a troop of French soldiers, and finally becoming the sweetheart of French society. The aforementioned count, played by Bramley Billipp, is a gaudy in ebriate, with an overfondness for the fair sex. x Confused Captain A dashing young captain, Dave Norwine is one of the male leads who can't ever find the time, the place and the girl all at once. Betty Clark, as Mrs. Brent, and Mr. Bent (in reality Bob Birnbaum) are two 'feelthy reech' American tourists in Paris. A dapper young artist's son, who spends his mother's money like water, is a miserable painter, and a worse lover is played by Jim Stanton, who sings the striking solo, 'Ze Engleesh Language' . . . Oooh la-la! The Modern Dance Group will pre sent their version of the dancers of the Follies Bergere, led by Lee Fiefer, who v ill dance the role of Bebe. Russell Miller has arranged a spe cial duet of 'Kiss Me Again', to be sung by Miss Monzert and Norwine. Among the other outstanding num bers in the show are Betty Clark's rendition of the satirical 'Culture Club of Keokuck', Billipp's 'I Want What I Want When I Want It', and the spine-tingling finale, 'Mascot of the Troops.' Handling the technical and finan cial ends of the production are Pat Wiley, business manager; Bill Koh- land, production manager, and Bob Landrum, stage manager."
FOREIGN STUDENTS IN,
COLLEGES AT HIGHEST,
"LEVEL, SURVEY FINDS","There are 30,000 students from other lands on American college cam puses right now, according to a sur vey made by the Institute of Interna- tioal Education, New York. Sitting side-by-side in classes with blue-jeaned Americans, these young people from many lands, representing a total investment of $75,000,000, are making student "" exchange"" an im portant prase of American foreign re lations. U nprecedented Kenneth Holland, President of the Institute, stated that this 30,000- strong ""foreign population"" in U. S. schools is without precedent. ""The large number is particularly signifi cant,"" he pointed out, ""when you re member that the U. S. has become an educational attraction only in the last twenty-five* years--and that not so long ago anyone who wanted a 'really good' education went to Europe."" Distribution in the United States of this foreign student population roughly corresponds to the total pop ulation of the states themselves, the survey shows. New York state, with a total population of more than 14,- 000,000, can count 5,452 foreign stu dents. Only 13 students from abroad, on the other hand, are learning about the U. S. in the state of Nevada. But 1400 schools, scattered all across the country, reported that they had at least one foreign student lending in ternational color to their student body. Columbia High Some reported over 1,000 foreign students (Columbia University, 1414; University of California, 1,323; New York University, 1,211). Other small er schools had a still higher percent age in relation to their total enroll ment (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 9.13 per cent; Harvard University, 5.88 per cent; Howard University, 5.37 per cent). One large factor in the fast-grow ing influx of students from abroad is that young people are coming in large numbers for the first time from many of the countries of Africa, the Near East and Asia. In 1930, according to a previous survey made by the Insti tute, there was only one student from Afghanistan in the U. S.--today there are 66. Two Burmese here in 1930 have multiplied to 88 here now. Chinese Scarce The Gold Coast of Africa, with no fine here twenty years ago, this year has 78. Iraq's eleven have grown to PS46, India's 195k to 1,136. (In the case of China, however, which has had a long record of sending its young people to school in America, ex changes are now of course in a state of dissolution, and the fate of the 3,549 Chinese students here today is undecided.)"

DR. CASTEEL TELLS OF,
FAITH AND KNOWLEDGE,"""Knowing and Being Known,"" was the subject of Dr. John L. Casteel's address at Chapel yesterday. Dr. Casteel of Union Theological Seminary, said that the major prob lem that confronts us today is the great amount of knowledge that we need to know and the small amount of knowledge that we actually pos sess. He believes that the limits of human capacity will never allow us to know all that we should know in this demanding world. The answer (Continued on page 8) , one ot the most unrelenting critics of the pas sage ran a cartoon last Sunday, in which the average guy stood looking at Joe College who was on a pedestal, who was the ""super citizen"", and say ing, ""Gee, isn't education grand?"" The paper takes the position that such a move is undemocratic, an ex ample of ""unequal sacrifice."" You defer the bright student and send the not so bright one to fight; and the guy that can't afford to go to college doesn't even have a chance. Frosh Deferred There are 334,000 males in their Freshman Year now. Of these only 159,000 are eligible for draft. And of these about two-thirds will be de ferred. This will lead to the drafting of every available non-college student, according to the Times. Other arguments advanced by the Times against the deferment clause include: the formation of an aristoc racy of brains making the average student feel inferior; college marks alone are not enough for a basis of judgment, what about leadership, per sonality; what objective tests could truely give fair results, without con sidering background studies, and what subjective test could refrain from bias. Inquirer Against The Philadelphia Inquirer is also against the move, but prefers to con centrate on a specific angle. ""The president's executive order for mass defennents of college students is shocking, It is already plain that this plea imperils the goal of 3,500,- 000 men for the fighting forces . . . . When to the proposal to jetting UMT is now added the plan for blanket de ferments on very questionable bases of some hundreds of thousands of college students, the prospects of creating strong well-prepared fight ing forces are becoming dangerously slim."" Bernard Baruch said that UMT is good, but should be passed without "" crippling amendments."" Professional careers ran a poor second with but a third of the stu dents listing that as their ambition, while post graduate work is the goal of the remaining Bucknellians. The poll interviewed a representa tive. group totaling 7%% of he under graduates. Class, sex, type of degree and fraternity-sorority affiliation were tken in to account. "" Students were fairly unanimous in regard to the general qualities of Bucknell as a place in which to obtain an educaion,"" Mr. Pfautz expliined, ""but when it comes to Bucknell's lo cation there is less agreement. Wo men students seemed to miss city life by their relatively high support of a suburban location; nevertheless, all agreed that they didn't want to go to a university located in a city."" When asked to state' what a college should do for its students, the Buck nellians put such goals as cultural character, and intelligent citizenship appreciation, development of moral secondary to training for an occupa tion or profession, an ability to deal with problems, or a knowledge of how to get along with all sorts of people. Students differed with their parents in many instances, when this poll was compared to one taken of parents by Elmo Roper in 1949 for TIME and FORTUNE magazines. Parents listed ""preparation for marriage^and family life"" as the first of their goals for their daughters, but Bucknell coeds placed this value last on heir list. This difference was Also apparent between parents and their sons. Ranking first in the Roper poll, ""training for a specific job"" slipped to second behind ""develop ment of a sharper, better-trained mind for dealing with all sorts of problems.""

The Nation's Finest?,
Column,"Last week one of our editorials, in commenting on the na-. tion's new policy of draft deferments for college students, men tioned that perhaps we shouldn't question this new Congress- given right of ours to persue our education whilst our unlearned brothers were sweating out the Korean thing. But with every tabloid in the country shrieking the order's ramifications we felt we might, at this point, add our own small cry, knowing that in all probability it will not reach farther than, say, 300 acres. The most obvious fault of the plan, of course, is its assump tion that every male with a high school diploma and an IQ  of 110 is enrolled in one of the nation's universities. This is not the case of course. It is generally conceded that only families with an upper-middle class income are in a position to finance four years of college. Mr. Benjamin Fine of the eminent New York Times reports that for every man in college, another of equal ability is unable to attend, mostly because of financial reasons. This explains why the more radical reviewers of this law are quick to suggest that our legislators are making a privileged class of those of us fortunate enough to be in college. Some educators are prone to argue that the law is worth while by virtue of its saving from military service the men who are genuinely concerned with getting a higher education. These students, it is pointed out, are the future scientists, engineers and leaders in the business field. W e would answer that by recalling the education boom caused by the returning veterans of World W ar"
II.,"The men who really wanted an education, it will be remembered, managed to get one even though they were a little older than the average campus man. And statistics tell us that in most cases the vet eran was better equipped to receive, college training. Even though the new policy may seem heaven-sent to the draft harassed Bucknell eligibles, we doubt if many agree whole heartedly with the principle of it."
L e tte r ; to  th e Editor,
Wherein Evidence Is Offered In,
Support Of Argument Concerning,
Change Of Seasons,"A t the risk of getting hammy, we'll go out on a limb this week by pointing out that the voice of the turtle has been heard on our campus. How do we know ? It's difficult to say just when we got our first clue, although we strongly suspect it was that day in the club house when Harold Evans, the golf pro, made his appearance in the first of what is sure to be a long series of odd looking golf hats. But then it might have been the day we noticed one of Mr. Geiger s charges at the foot of the campus with the burlap bag and the inevitable stick with a nail in one end. When we start worrying about papers on the grass, there'll be no more snow, we reasoned. , Then again maybe it was just the nostalgic look in every body's eye when someone mentioned H alf-W ay. This evidence is mostly circumstantial and intangible, we realize, but we still know those people who claim that if they haven't done any work up to now, they'll flunk for sure. Ah, Spring!"

CCNY PAPER DROPPED FOR INSULTING PREXY,"""The Campus"" , City College of New York under-graduate newspaper, was suspended last week by a committee of faculty members for ""insulting the col lege president."" The unprecedented move was taken without the knowledge of President Harry W. Wright who was traveling in the midwest and did not see the issue of April 2. The suspension, is subject to Dr. Wright's approval* when he returns. No action was taken against the ten-man newspaper board by the group of six faculty members and the Dean of Students. The Student Faculty Com- mittee has the authority to take disciplinary action. Lester M. Nichols, assistant to President Wright, said that the April 2 edition was "" unbecoming to a college newspaper"" and criticized the alleged insult as "" bad taste."" , r "" (tm)e Campus""  has been published since 1907 and has a daily circulation o f 5,000."
More OnJjCrisis,": Dear Mr. Editor: For the better portion of five weeks, I Bucknell's CRISIS has floundered in j a hubub of charges, and counter- I charges which have served primarily | to stimulate indignation, create con- I fusion and yet to arouse the latent desire of Bucknellian's to maintain our University at a high plane of I thought and action. This letter is written in the hope that Bucknell will respond to the myriad problem in a manner which will bring to the fore this latent avidness. It has been clearly pointed out in the Letter's to the Editor, President Hildreth's statement, and in the Buck- neliian Editorials that this school is faced with a CRISIS. Thus far, the CRISIS has been presented as an economic depletion--the answer has been a defense o f faculty in terms primarily o f personality. The prob lem that faces Bucknell is a focal one in the University's historical milieu. It is far deeper than merely economic ! woes and certainly transcends the realm of individual personalities. We Bucknellians are face to face with the dynamic problems "" For j What Does a University Stand?"", and "" What does a University Mean in j Terms o f Those Who Are Part of it--"
"I THE STUDENTS, THE FACULTY",
AND,
THE,"ADMINISTRATION."" We believe that a University is a community-- a community of interests if you will--which has two integral parts-- THE STUDENTS AND THE"
TEACHERS.,"It is the duty o f the Administration to insure that the optimum value is gained and maintained in Student- Teacher relationships. Because as Americans, as maturing men and women, and as citizens of a larger world, we the students are in dire need o f developing our abilities to the farthest extent possible. Bucknell has always stood fo r this type of de velopment through the maintenance o f a low ratio of students to teachers, because only through the intimate face-to-face relationship so procured can an individual properly ascertain and use the tools o f a school o f higher learning. The philosophy o f "" small classes"" has been an integral part of the Uni versity's growth and development for 105 years. Unless: something is done i to the contrary, it appears that such a philosophy will undergo the pernic ious force of time and ""new philoso phy."" It appears to some of us that the catalyst, the grease which keeps I the University functioning, in endeav-1 | oring to re-orientate the values in I [ I many American Universities has be-1 I gun disastrously by placing itself i uPdegn the top-rung in.terms of import- ( j j ance. This is a dangerous and we > i j believe an unwise step.. If any Uni- ! ! ! versity is to remain a UNIVERSITY I * | in the truest sense of the word, it i j m"" st make sure that the area of j | j greatest importance is reserved: for I i | the Students and Teachers. To des- : j troy this area is to render a Univer- | sity impotent in a world so lacking, yet so needful of ""Academic Insight.'' How then does all this relate spe cifically to Bucknell ? We have been told that Bucknell is faced with a j deficit estimated at $200,000.. Cer- j tainly this figure would indicate that j definite steps were necessary in. order to minimize the loss. However, it is | vitally important to note that this j figure is based on this year's cost of j operations, and the drop' in: student enrollment estimated to months ago at 25 to 40%. If there is going to be a large percentage drop in stu dents as we have been told, the cost o f running the University from an | administrative point of view should | also drop. However, the latest indi- j cations of next year's student enroll- I ment, since the -original estimate, are considerably more optimistic, and I there is strong evidence that Buck- I nell's enrollment with the increase in I women students and R. O. T. C. will suffer only a relatively slight de crease. Certainly, all these estimations noted above are highly tenuous Nevertheless, on the basis that the faculty should be informed first so that they might get new teching jobs (virtually impossible!), teachers have been informed and are being inform ed that they are fired! This move was made in direct opposition to the pleadings of the- American Associa tion of University Professors which has begged the Universities in the country to hold onto its Proessors lest they leave the teaching profession for more lucrative fields. The Uni versity has expressed a desire to re instate these teachers as soon as the situation returns to "" normalcy"" , but some of the disposed have expressed the wish ""never to return."" At this point, because some may feel that we are maliciously attacking University policy, we should like to make it quite clear that we have no"
"Schloo Says, *No Sckmoof","April 7, 1951 To The Editor: Dear Sir: In the last issue of the BUCK NELLIAN, the music column ""AS THE CAT SEES THEM"" was rather harshly criticized in a letter to the editor for its alleged use o f (1) coined words and (2) vulgarity. In answering these charges, the Cat has asked me to reply (I) that the column is not written for squares and (2) that Horace Greeley once said "" A narrow mind is the essence of vulgarity."" Sincerely, Herb- Schloo"
Another Wmchell?,"Lewisburg, Pa.. Dear Editor : Miss Howard had quite a  lot to- say last week about musicolumnist (sic) Herb (""The Cat"" ) Schloo>>. none of it pleasant. Her main objection seems to be against his coined words."
I,"would remind her that coined words may be found in "" Time'', Winchell's daily column, and in the recond re views in "" Metronome"", from which I quote at random: "" Side has a Lunce- fordish flavor"" ....... "" Rasping Anthony trumpet, piping Millerish saxes ....... "" and so on. Re his so-called "" vulgarisms"" : "" bastardized Miller""  is an excellent descriptive phrase for a musical style which is little better than a poor imi tation of Glenn Miller. Jazz record review writing is all in a terse, des criptive vein similar to The Cat's and "" vulgarisms"" are often resorted to. I hesitate to discuss criteria, since I don't know what criteria any record reviewer uses, other than his enjoy ment or dislike of the record in ques tion. "" The Cat's style is definitely idio matic and nit for bluenoses; if Miss Hov^hrd doesn't like the column, there is not-a thing on this earth (or off it for that matter) that compels her to read it. I say it's one of the few features in this rag hat doesn't suffer from an advanced -case of pernicious anemia. Long live vulgarisms and "" The Cat's"" "" private vocabulary"" ! Yours, Geo. A. Blacker doubt that the actions that have been taken were taken with the very best interests of Bucknell University at heart at well as with great considera tion of those affected. We don't be lieve in ""crying over spilt milk."" Rather, very briefly we believe we have some suggestions which if car ried through would enable the Uni versity to maintain its present faculty enrollment without further going into debt. These suggestions of necessity would require the utmost cooperation of the students, the faculty and the administration. But we believe the results obtained in value for the Uni versity would more than compensate for the effort expended. Our suggestions include five major points:"
L,"We suggest that the University place students in as many of the ad ministrative positions (secretarial, bookkeeping, etc.) as possible, thus not only cutting down costs, but giv ing added experience to those stu dents who participate in such a pro ject. Credit could be given for this work on the student's academic pro gram. r-orcTo6 students may help in this CRISIS by cutting down their budget and using the money saved to help the University ease the situation. The most notable expenditure that could be cut in the budgets o f the many organizations is the allotment for banquets. 3. We suggest to the senior class and to all succeeding classes until such a time as the CRISIS shall have passed, the using of that money al- loted to them for the Senior Gift to help establish a type 0f scholarship for a faculty member. 4. We don't believe that the ath letic program should be made the scape-goat"" o f expense cuts; but since it is one of the largest single expenses of the University for its stu- en s ue feel that some cut should be made. ?"" ^ e faculty should cooperate in this endeavor by taking a 5% in- : f r - 'nStead of and donating dlfference to maintenance of fac ulty. The only road to solution lies in the close cooperation of the three inter ested gr0UpS( none hiding anything from the other and all aiming to fos- ter^the spirit of a TRUE UNIVERS- Sincerely yours, , Robert Carman, on be- o a 8rdegup of interested students. 1 THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 1951."

Dr. Zimmerman spoke on "" Thought* trends in Christian History"" and Dr. Folsom spoke on "" Secular Views of the fSmily."" Chuck Mercer, chairman of the C. A. commission on campus and per sonal affairs, was in charge of the conference along with Dr. Richard DuWors of the sociology department. At the closing session of the con ference on Sunday at 7:15 p. m. in Hunt Rec Room, Dr. Zimmerman spoke on ""The Future of the Family."" He emphasized the fact that "" society is in desperate need of a re-invigor ated study and understanding of family life."" Dr. Zimmerman warned that the future of the family depends on ""whether or not we can get inspired leadership for the solution of our family problems in time to preserve our civilization."" "" We are now in a period of polar ization in family values. We can see at the same time both the most beau tiful and the most ignoble expres sions of family life,"" he said. "" This polarization represents a breakdown in a period of transitiin. We need more families that will pro duce better integrated and better mo tivated men and women than ever be fore in our history. We need strong er family units than ever before, but we do not have them. ""We can say with certainty that we will have a recreated family in the future. The important issue is whether it will come in a short enough period for us to preserve the high tension life in which we live, or whether it will be so delayed that we will first have to reduce the tension."" Dr. Folsom who spoke on the same subject, ""The Future of The Family"" stated that there is a trend toward greater variety and change in both family life and society as a whole. He said, "" Many social thinkers are afraid that with the trend toward atomism our social structure will fall apart. . It is true that society and the family unit have moved toward atom ism, with more freedom for the indi vidual family member. "" But social cohesion is not disap pearing, I think. It is changing its character. For one thing, in our change toward urban society, people are being held together by economic interdependence. Control by love is becoming a greater force in many"

LEAGUE A,
Mural Race Changes As Kappa Sigs,
Bow Three Straight In Net Finals,"by Bill LeMon In three straight games the Lambda Chi volleyball team romped over Kappa Sigma last night in Davis Gym to win the 1951 championship cup. The scores of the games were 15-4, 15-12 and 15-4. LCA Underdog The Lambda Chi team was decided ly the underdog at the opening of the game having been beaten by the Kap pa Sigs in the regular seasons play by scores of 15-13 and 15-12. In the first game, K. S. served first and drew first blood. For eight con secutive volleys the ball flew back and forth giving neither team a single point. The excellent spiking by the Green put a 7-1 lead over the Kappa Sigs before the Redmen could score again. Near the end of the set the teams found it nearly impossible to score but finally the freeze broke and Lambda Chi sailed on for a 15-4 win. Second Match Close The second clash of the evening proved to be the most exciting and closest. Again Kppa Sigma took the initial point and captured a quick 4-0 lead. Still lacking spiking power the Redmen picked up their points on long, back-court shots. After a time out the LCA men bounced back and came within one point of the Kappa Sigs, 5-4. The KS team made it 9-4 but a six point surge by LCA gave them the lead 10-9 and they went on to post a 15-12 decision. The last game opened with Lambda Chi winning the first point and the next six before giving up a tally to their opponents. The LCA spiking was matched by the fine blocking of the Kappa Sigs. Again long, back- court shots changed the tide of the game and the Lambda Chi team soar ed on for another 15-4 victory and clinched the volleyball championship cup. Standings Change The Lambda Chi victory changed the standings among the leaders in the Mural race considerably. By vir tue of their volleyball supremacy the LCA moved into undisputed posses sion of second place, still trailing the Kappa Sigs. SAE follows in third place while DU has slipped to fourth position. Rounding out the first five is Sigma Chi. Greatest improvement in the stand ings resulting from volleyball was made by TKE. The Teke's moved from ninth position to seventh as a result of their undefeated regular sea son ecord. They were defeated in the playoffs. The Mural Standings:"

Baseballers Outlast Crusaders,
"In Heavy Slugging Duel, 11-8","by Ell wood Rowe In a game staged before a fine opening day crowd, warmed to the occasion by a bright April son, the Herd chalked up baseball victory number one last Saturday by outlasting Susquehanna 11-8. Loss No. 2 For the visiting Crusaders, who used four flingers in an attempt to stem the tide, it was defeat number two in as many outings as they had previously been dealt an 11-0 white washing by Swarthmore one week agfi today. Coach Bill Lane's men, who aveng ed last year's 4-3 loss, had to come from behind twice in order to top the fighting and determined Crusaders from Selinsgrove. The fourth and seventh innings, in each of which they tallied four runs, carried the Lane- men to victory. Five runners wented the plate for S. U. in a big fifth frome uprising. S. U. Scores First The visiting Orange and Maroon drew first blood in the see-saw battle as they pushed across two runs in the third frame off Bison starter Dick Roush. Ken Orris started things off for the Crusaders by singling through the box. Rich Young then laid down a bunt which rolled through Roush's legs, Orris advancing to second. Roush then set down Menapace, burly S. U. catcher, swinging at a third strike, after which Berninger forced Young at second, Weber to Long. Red Wollaston, first sacker, poled a long fly ball to deep right cen ter which eluded the outstretched gloved-hand of Abe Powellson--Bern inger and Orris scoring on the play. Bisons Score The Lanemen picked up a singleton in their half of the third and took a commanding 5-2 lead in the fourth as they racked up four more markers. Webber sent Franke across the plate with the first run in the big fourth by lashing a sharp line drivp single over third. Orris's throw, to mena pace was in time to catch Franke, but the big catcher dropped the ball when he collided with the runer. Bill Keay, sophomore outfielder who replaced starter Mai Sinclair in left, slapped a single between first and second scoring Webber with the homesters' third run and second of the inning. Jim DiGuiseppi reached second as Ross fumbled his roller and then overthrew first. Roush died to right scoring Keay. Shirk walked and went to third as Marty McKibbin looped a double along the right field foul line. Ray Kaseman, starting pitcher for Susquehanna, was lifted in favor of Ken Lenker who got Art Long on a called third strike to end the ourth inning uprising. Lucas Hurls The invaders scored five times on as many hits in the fifth as they knocked Roush out of the box. Dave Lucas soutpaw flinger replaced him on the mound. The highlight of the ironing from a Susquehanna stand- Spoint was Sam Ross's base-clearing double off Lucas which hit inches in side the left field foul line."
S. U.,"there assumed a 7-5 lead. Undaunted by Ross' stinging blow, Lucas in the seventh upheld the Buck- nell tradition of the past few years of always having heavy hitting pitch ers as he' rapped the second pitch thrown to him by Johnson, third Cru sader hurler, for a long triple to right center. Andy Shirk sent Lucas scurring home with the fourth tally of the inning as he died to Orris in left. Crusaders Finish Susquehanna ended its scoring for the day with a single marker in the top of the eighth, and the Orange and Blue tossers added runs number tei and eleven in the bottom of the same frame. The visitors outhit the Herd 14-12 and committed one less miscue in the three hour marathon. Together the wo teams made 11 errors. Orris :onnected for three hits for the losers and Rowe, Young and Fenstermacher chipped in with two a piece. Jackie Webber, who played errorless ball at shortstop, slammed out three one- basers for the winners, and Bill Keay and Marty McKibbin hit safely twice. Line Score S.

"""Hardware of Every Description' *","by Harry Staley Your first opportdnity to see the ""new"" Bison' football team, the spring edition, will be on April 21 ....... On that day the F. & M. Diplomats will be here to meet the Lawrencemen in a scrimmage session"
......,"On the following Satur day the Herd will go to State College to meet the Nittany Lion gridders ....... If you want an earlier glimpse of the team and an idea of how the Split-T really works you might view the exhibition of the formation in Memorial Sta dium this Saturday.......Many area high school coaches will be on hand to view the proceedings. Schedule Troubles Schedule difficulties still prevent announcing the 1951 slate ....... Rumor has it that another of B. U.'s prospective opponents has decidedto give up the grid iron sport ....... Negotiations are now underway to complete the schedule which should be announced shortly. A tongue in cheek observation of the baseball team leaves us with one prevailing thought ...... This year's team definitely looks better at the plate ....... If the mound staff seemed to waver last Saturday don't forget that inside work is no substitute for Old Sol ........ As soon as the weather picks up the mound staff should come around ..... ..Lucas certainly impressed after he had warmed up ....... The infield, sparked by smooth-fielding Jackie Webber is a dandy. Away Broadcasts? No word yet on whether the away baseball games will be broadcast ....... All away games will not be broadcast but it is hoped that the Navy, Penn State and possibly the Middle Atlantic Tournament games will be aired"
.......,Sponsor ship probably depends on student interest in the broadcasts ....... Several Sus quehanna fans enjoyed the PA system in human form at last weeks contest
......,"One Bison rooter in particular was needling the Crusaders no end...,,...At least its spirit. Mark down as one very embarrassed persons the Susquehanna rooter who carefully pointed out that the score was 7 to 5 in favor of the Crusaders when relief pitcher Johnson came on the scene to stop a Bison rally ....... With the bases loaded and Lucas at the plate, the visiting rooter chose this moment to point out to surrounding Orange and. Blue hopefuls that Susquehanna still held the upper hand ----- His confidence, quickly turned to chagrin as Lucas punctuated his declaration with a base clearing triple to deep right-center ....... Silence reigned therafter. From Gridiron To Classroom At least two former Herd footballers are now making their extra points in the classroom ....... Walter Hall, end on last year's varsity is now practice teaching in Sunbury ....... ""Smokey"" Ostendarp is tutoring in Milton and has proven to be quite a sensational guy among the school kids.......Both men are teaching math with ""Smokey"" doubling in Phs. Ed. Several ""teed-off"" golfers are bemoaning the prices of the University Golf Course ....... The objections are not directed at full season memberships but at the prevailing prices for a single trip around the course ....... Some stu dents can't make it to the course every day and balk even more when faced with a $1.50' charge or $2225 on Wednesdays and weekends ....... Is it another case of financial necessity or can we give the students a break ? Time Trials For Penn Relays Bus Blum will hold time trials for the Penn Relay competition this Friday ....... deg ur vote for B- U.'s busiest student goes to A1 Jodrey, our sports photog rapher ....... In addition to his BUCKNELLIAN work he still finds time to take L'Agenda pix, work at the Women's Dining Hall, and chase foul balls as the varsity baseball manager"
......,"His work completed on the 1951 L'Agenda, word has it that he is already well underway on the 1952 edition. Drafted By Steelers Bill Szabo, standout tackle on the Bison football teams for two years has been drafted ....... Not by Uncle Sam but by the National Professional Football League Pittsburgh Steelers ----- If he enters the play for pay ranks the Phoenixville, Pa. athlete will be the third Bucknellian active in the Pro> foot ball field and the second to join the Steelers ....... Walter Szot, former Bison tackle is now on the Steeler roster while Jim Ostendarp bolsters the running attack of the New York Giants. again dominate the headlines, only this year, for the first time since the trophy was established, the Templars will be fighting to regain instead of retain the award.

Lanemen Seek Revenge At Delaware;,
Return To Face Juniata Wednesday,"by Bill Fulmer * << ""  kane 8 charges travel south this Saturday for a game with Delaware's pine uehens, and will return for a home game with the Juniata diamond squad next Wednesday, weather permitting of course. Bison Revenge"
Q,"---------- -- ------------------------------------ A year ago ""Shack"" Martin's Blue Hens halted a Bison four game win streak 2-0 in spite of the two hit pitching served up by Bucknell's Al. Hegelein, Juniata succumbed 4-2 to the Bucknell squad last year, but still holds an 18-16 game edge in a rivalry that dates back to 1917. Coach Lane may effect a few changes in outfield lineup before Del aware game time. In an attempt to pase the pitching problem, Mai Sin clair will probably be brought in from left field to join the pitching corps, leaving considerable rearranging to be done in the pastures. Dick Roush I8 expected to start on the mound, With Bobby Alberts receiving. Delaware Tough With seven lettermen back in har ness, ""Shack"" Martin believes his Del aware team is going to be hard to beat. Among these seven veterans are Captain Joe Higgins at 2nd and Al Brodhag, rated as one best back stops in Eastern Collegiate ball. One big bright spot for Bucknell routers will be the graduation and absence of John Green, who pitched shut out ball to the Lanemen last year. Juniata, always a threat, remains somewhat of a question mark. 1 Tbey won their first game behind the left- handed pitching of Lefevre, a good southpaw, who will undoubtedly"" op pose Bucknell on Wednesday. Coach Lane believes that his squad will be meeting an older, more experienced, and a generally improved team over last year's. Bisons At Disadvantage The Delaware and Juniata en counters will mark the second and third outings of the current campaign #U .... = ^ = Coach Bill Lane . . seeks second victory' for the B. U. regulars. After a suc cessful 11-8 opener against the Muddy River (Susquehanna) boys, th e weather man took a hand and washed last Saturday's game with F&M right off the, schedule. Bucknell will be at a distinct disadvantage when they meet the Bluehens who already have nine games under their belts, includ ing such teams as Maryland, George town, Navy and Dartmouth."

Netmen Embark On Second Trip,
"Meet Haverford, LaSalle, Dupont","by Harry McSorley Bucknell University's varsity ten nis squad embarks on a three-day trip to the Philadelphia area this weekend, where it will meet Haver- ord and LaSalle Colleges on Friday and Saturday, and will play in an in vitation match with the DuPont Coun try Club in Wilmington, Delaware on Sunday. F & M  Rained Out Rained out in their scheduled match with Franklin and Marshall on Tuesday, the Bison netmen have high hopes o making a clean sweep on this second road trip of the current season. Last week the Bucknellians dropped three straight matches to George Washington, Maryland, and the U. S. Naval Academy, after poor weather conditions had considerably handicapped practice sessions. The recent warm weather, however, has seen the Orange and Blue team rapid ly approaching an early season peak in preparation for the weekend com petition. Coach Hank Peters has announced that his singles men this week will be Alan Goff, Paul Remmey, Gray Rog ers, Bill Retiz, Skippy Hess, and Maurice Mufson. The doubles com binations will consist of Goff-Hess, Remmey-Reitz, arid Rogers-Mufson. Recovering from a case of measles, the veteran Nick Schloeder will be unable to participate in this week's matches. fhilly Teams Tough Haverford and LaSalle are both re spected in the Philadelphia district for their usually strong tennis teams, and Bucknell does not expect any easy going. Rounding out the week end will be the invitational affair in Wilmington. The DuPont Country Club team, coached by Eddie Moylan, well-known national amateur figure, will present the Bisons with a taste o topflight amateur competition. The team will leave early Friday morning for the Haverford match which is scheduled to get underway at 2:30 that afternoon."

Scrimmage Feature Emphasis will be placed on the of fensive and defensive tactics of the Split-T. The opening feature of the clinic from two to three o'clock, will be an intersquad scrimfage, designed to give the spectators an idea of the split-T in actual operation.

Under the tutelage of the Herd coaehisg stac, demonstra tions of various phases of the game will be given. The participants will split up into smaller groups on the playing field to observe the methods. To Hold Forum After the practical work the clinic will adjourn to the Vaughn Lit Au ditorium where a forum will be held. Questions if all types concerning Bucknell's system will be answered.

Records Reveal Seven Men Who,
Confirm Bisons Enjoy Diversity,"by Bob Hunter A position on one of the varsity teams is usually enough to fulfill the dreams and ambitions of any college athlete. More than a little talent is necessary for intercollegiate competition in any given sport, particularly if it is a major sport, that is, one of the ""big three""--football, baseball or bas ket balk 1 -- Varsity athletics take a maximum amount of work and effort which also means a maximum consumption of time. The participant must not only spare a couple of hours each day for practice and regular games, but he also finds his time taken up by away contests and road trips. Nevertheless, B. U. can boast no less than seven athletes who are working for monograms in more than one sport. Two. of these men are ex pending their talents in three varsity sports. Such diversity of talent is quite remarkable, to say the least-- o let's give a salute to this septet of athletes. Franke Only Senior Bill Franke, only senior in the group, played a very capable offen sive end for football coach Harry Lawrence during the last three cam paigns. The Millburn, N. J. athlete is now holding down the right field spot on coach Bill Lane's baseball squad. Pacing the Junior roster are the only three-letter men in the school, Joe Gallagher and Marty McKibbin. Marty, who holds down an offensive end position in football also did well on the hardwood for basketball coach Jack Guy. He was a pillar of strength in the latter half of the season when injuries handicapped the Bisons, ris ing to his best performances when the going was tough. Denville, N. J.'s contribution to Bison athletic for tunes has returned for his second sea son at first base on the baseball dia mond. Joe Gallagher Joe Gallagher is another offensive end on the football squad. An un canny sense of direction and ability to outjump taller men made Gallagher a favorite receiver during the past two gridiron campaigns. It is as a orward in basketball that Gallagher will probably be remembered most. Another New Jersey athlete, Newark, Joe has smashed just about every existing B. U. basketball scoring rec ord. He became the first Bison bas ketball player ever to score over 400 points in one basketball season when he tossed 416 points through the bas ket in the recent season. Gallagher's third monogram was earned on the track team where he ran the 880 for coach Bus Blum. Hard-running fullback Bob Albert is now limbering up his right arm as a catcher for the Lanemen this spring. ""Albie"" has been one of B. U.'s most successful footballers due to his hard- driving tactics. The tall Mt. Lebanon native has made one appearance on the diamond this season and perform ed well behind the plate in addition to lashing out a timely single. Jack Webber Jackie Webber, a guard on the basketball team, shines as a smooth- fielding shortstop on the diamond. Jack played a brilliant game for Jack Guy on the court as a sure-handed playmaker with a deadly one-hand push shot. However, it is on the diamond that the Gloucester, Mass, athlete seems sure to make his mark. Webber has already established him self as one of the smoothest fielding shortstops ever to play for the Bison nine. In the sophomore class, Abe Powell son and Brad Myers are now busily campaigning for their second mono gram as members of the baseball team. Powellson, an end on the foot ball team now patrols centerfield for the baseballers while speedy halfback Brad Myers, leading scorer for the Bisons last fall, is currently working out as a left fielder. Goddard To Teach Life-Saving Miss Goddard will teach life-saving this Saturday afternoon at the Milton Pool. The bus will leave from Lari- son at 1;30 and the class will be held from 2-4 p, m. This opportunity for those who want their life-saving cer tificates will continue until the end of May. Take Yourself To The Ball Game Regularly scheduled softball prac tices began yesterday. The list is on the bulletin board in the gym. Check when your group is playing and real ly make the practices worthwhile! Intergroup Badminton Monday The intergroup badminton doubles start April 16. The first round must be played between that time and the 20th. Practice will be from 3:30 to 5:30 every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and from 4:30 to 5:30 every Tuesday and Thursday from April 9 to 13. Sophomore II Victorious In the recent interclass basketball tournament the Sophomore II team took first place with six wins and no losses."

"THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, RENNA.","THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 1951."
Village Voice,"by Bill Wakefield Plans are underway for a Village Spring Party this Saturday at 8:00 o'clock in T. D. Muriel Benjamin has been appointed chairman, and in dications are that this will be a big day on our com munity's calendar. Now let's all get b^ind it! H V . i l l B H i Several children Bill Wakefield have recently been spending unwelcome days in bed. Arthur and Skeeter Ivey underwent tonsillectomies last week; Richie Gob. bo has been pretty ill; and Jamie Holmes and Jeffrey Peters have the measles. Are you sure you want to be a kid again? From the Village to Apt. A-35, Fleetwood Park Apts., 800 Bronx River Road, Bronxville, N. Y. is a big jump. But Art and Marilyn Feather- stone, with sons David and Bobby, will make it on April 23. .A rt has accepted a position as secretary to the vice president of the New York Central Railroad, and will begin work in New York City on May 1. The Featherstone's have accepted a splen did opportunity, and we wish them all the luck in the world. Paul Evans has been elected vice president of the Village Association; to serve out the term of Art Feather- stone. Well, this family's turn finally came -- and we took it! So now we have two boys to bring up and send back to the "" 300 acres set apart."" Two and-a-half-year-old Billy likes his 2- week-old brother, Stephen Lee (born March 20; 8 lbs., 7 oz.), very much but I'm wondering if there might not be some ""discussion"" in a few years- for example, when both want the family car the same night. Ah, well we'll cross each bridge as we come to it-- and gladly! Family of the Week There's someone new at Stell and Augie Kline's. His name is Kimball August, and when he arrived on March 18 to share the Kline Apt. with sister Karen, he weighed 6 lbs., 2 oz Five-year-old Karen has invited Kim to stay and, from all appearances, Kim has settled down for a very long visit. In 1941 Augie was visiting in Phila delphia and met a certain girl. Later on, several dates followed; then in the fall of 1942 Augie went into the Army and romance was forced to take a war-time vacation. But in March, 1945, while Augie was still on crutches from the wounds of Japanese machine gun slugs, the couple got married. The Philippines, The Dutch East Indies, and New Guinea are a long way from Augie's home town of Port Allegheny, Pa., but he was there, and helped to prove that "" this trip is real ly necessary."" While her future hus band was serving half way around the world, Stell was in defense work at Bendix Aircraft in Philadelphia, her home-town. During his 52 months' service, Au gie decided he'd go to college after his discharge. In 1947 and 48 he took a prep course at Dickinson in Wil liamsport, and then started at Buck- nell in September, 1948. What about the future after graduation in Au gust? A C&F major, Augie would like to become established with a good company, and is looking forward to providing his family with a comfort able living. There's no doubt in our mind--he'll do it!"
PROF-FILES,"Olds, Rogers Tournament Bound Jerry Olds and Charles Rogers will represent Bucknell in the National Inter-Collegiate Bridge Tournament which is being held at the Blackstone Hotel, Chicago, Illinois, on April 20 and 21.

^ T J u C a t,
jdL %,"rem . .. * iy fcAht by Bobbie Maurer Dr. Lowry, chairman of the Physics department, has led a busy life. To use his own words, he has kept his nose to the grindstone and behaved himself. Born in Carbondale, Pennsylvania,<< he graduated from high school in 1917. After working for a year with the telephone company, he spent a few months in the armed services. He attended Bucknell and obtained his master's degree here in 1923. In 1929, he received his Ph. D. at Cornell. Starting out in 1920 as assistant pro fessor in the department, he has risen in the ranks to chairman, which office he has held since 1942. A member of many societies and honoraries, Dr. Lowry considers Sigma Xi, national science honorary, one of his greatest honors. His time is taken up with various committees and outside busi ness interests, in addition to church work and his obligations as a mason. He used to do research and has pub lished some of his material."
A,"Pennsylvanian through a n d through, Dr. Lowry is married, has two children, and lives in Linntown. He used to be very enthusiastic about fishing and swimming, and has a summer cottage at one of the lakes in this region, where he spends rest ful summers. While he used to col lect stamps, Dr. Lowry now takes delight in toying with amateur radio. He also plays around with his' out board motor. Bucknell "" Then"" Bucknell was quite different when Dr. Lowry came here. The enroll ment was probably less than 500. In 1918, they had the SATC, the equiva lent of the last war's V-12, under which there was strict military dis cipline. I'm sure that the social Reg ulations of that time would be heart ily rejected by today's students. The girls had to be in by 6:00 every day except one when they were allowed out from 7:00 to 9:00. They couldn't dance, and were escorted to and from fraternity ""parties"" in a group by a woman teacher. As a result, the town girls who could dance were quite popular. The old senior path o f those days was that path leading from Robert's Hall to chapel at Bucknell Hall. The students would walk along in order of their classes, while the freshmen and sophomores were not allowed to walk on the path. Dr. Lowry maintains that "" it is a shame we don't inform students about outstanding men of the campus""-- some of the people who are a part of Bucknell's history."

Mr. Groover arranged the trip so that the class, which is studying the organization and functions of governmental agen cies and commissions, would have an opportunity to observe the operation of these agencies and commissions at close range. The trip was highlighted by a per sonal interview with Mr. Charles R. Barber, Secretary of the State Treas ury, and by an inspection of the treas ury vault, which at the present time contains over eight hundred million dollars in negotiable securities.

The Mike,"by Jim Hastings Your Radio Workshop has added a new personality to its list of outstand ing radio celebraties. His name is Mel Strong, a senior, and a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity! Mel be came interested in having his own radio show which he has entitled COLLECTOR'S CORNER after hav ing taken a course from Mr. Ewing in radio script writing. . Mel conceived the idea for his pro gram consisting of present-and-past- popular collector's items from his long established desire for 'concert jazz' and 'olil favorite' recordings. This currently featured show may be heard over WVBU every Wednesday evening from 8:30 until 9:30. At present, Mel is featuring fav orite records by Woody Herman, Benny Goodw'in and his magic clari net, and Stan Kenton, all outstanding artists among collegiate groups. From the general reaction about cam pus, COLLECTOR'S CORNER has not only managed to hold its own among the older shows, but has shown a marked popularity for a new pro gram. Disc Jockey's Problems But just like everything else in this world, this disc jockey, too, is having his problems. As a steady listener to the music ^nd news station you may be able to help Mel, for if you possess or even know anyone that owns an album or two of collector item recordings just give him a call at 2700. Even one or tw o. records would help. Your disc jockey has promised a ""double-your-record-back"" guarantee if your discs aren't return- | ed promptly and in good condition. Now that you have a chance to help your station, what do you say that we all give a helping hand."

Movie Chatter,"HOW TO GET THAT ""A"" 1. Bring the teacher newspaper clippings dealing with his subject. This j demonstrates fiery interest and gives him timely items to mention to the class. If you can t find clippings dealing with his subject, bring in any clippings. He thinks everything deals with his subject. 2. Look alert. Take notes eagerly. If you look at your watch, don't stare at it unbelievingly and shake it. 3. Nod frequently and murmur, ""How true,"" To you this seems exag gerated. TJo him, it's quite objective. 4. Sit in front of him. (Applies only if you intend to stay awake). If you are going to all the trouble of making a good impression, you might as well let him know who you are, especially if it is a large class. 5. Laugh at his jokes. You can tell. If he looks up from his notes and smiles expectantly, he has told a joke. 6. Ask for outside reading. You don't have to read it. Just ask. 7. If you must sleep, arrange to be called at the end of the hour. It creates an unfavorable impression if the rest o f the class has left and you sit there, dozing. 8. Be sure the book you read during the class looks like a text book. Match books for size and color. 9. Ask any questions you thnk he can answer. Conversely, avoid an nouncing that you have found the answer to a question he couldn't answer, and in your brother's third grade reader at that. * * * * * "". . .  A gripe about why students cheat? Yes. They don't cheat to hurt each other's grades. They cheat to beat the instructor at his own game. I ace you before you ace me."" * >> * * *"
THE FATE OF THE 'GREEN GANDER' . . .,"The Green Gander, humor magazine at Iowa State College, is facing a life-and-death dilemma. It has its choice of either cleaning up the magazine or discontinuing publication. h Pressure from various groups on and off the campus have initiated a ""clean-up""  campaign, designed to revolutionize the content of the magazine. The Christmas issue of the magazine has been called especially offensive. Other humor magazines in Iowa are having similar troubles. at Drake University and the University of Iowa have been told officially and unofficially that certain jokes "" without taste"" must disappear from the pages. * * * * * Amherst, Mass.-- (I. P.)--Freshman coeds at the University of Massa chusetts chafed a bit last September when Monday through Thursday were set aside as Study Nights,"" and a 7 p. m. curfew on outside campus activities was imposed until December. Dean of Women Helen Curtis now reports that 77% of all freshmen girls achieved an average higher than 70% in Dean's progress reports. Moreover, 22%, more than one-fifth of all freshman girls, had ""Dean's list"" (honor grades )-- over 80. "" This shows that the freshman girls have made a good start in college studies, Dean Curtis said, adding that the curfew program was deemed a success. The freshmen who achieved grades higher than 70 may now partici pate in extra-curricular activities at their discretion."

Success Can Be Predicted,
For College Gals And Guys,"If you are a young woman of 19, who had a better than B average in high school, you will probably be a success in college. This conclusion comes frim Professir Homer J. L. Carter and Miss Doro thy McGinnis, of Western Michigan college. They recently finished a study which show conclusively that school marks and the estimate of scholarship ability by the high school principle are reliable bases for predicting the calibre of academic work at the college level. Other factors which hinge on college success are: the number of books and periodicals read during the senior year in high school; language skills. Successful Gal Here^is a further description o f the talented 19-year-old girl who is almost certain to be a success: She has made a definite vocational choice; she claims to have read five books and six periodicals during her senior year; she has fail ed no high school courses and has taken quite a bit of math. 1 he person most likely to fail in college is a young man of twenty who had a C average in high school. He has as yet made no vocational choice; he is accepted in college on condition and does not re-enter next semester."

College Testing Plans Remain,
Unimpaired In Spite Of House,
Amendment To The Draft Bill,"G<<n. Lewis B. Hershey, Director of Selective Service, said in a speech Sun- ay night that a House amendment to the manpower draft bill stating that draft boards were not to be bound by the results of aptitude tests ""in no way impairs our plans for giving aptitude tests to college students and using the scores. ""The amendment,"" he said, ""merely > recognizes a state of affairs that al ready has existed--that the ultimate decision as to whether a man should or should not be drafted rests with his local draft board."" The Selective Service head also stated that the induction of college men would be delayed this spring until their test scores and scholastic standings had been, determined. Stu dents who score seventy or higher in the test or who are in the upper ranks scholastically may receive an occupational deferment in order to permit their education to continue next fall. No One Denied Test ""Generally speaking,"" General Her shey said, ""no student will be denied permission to take the test because of his draft board status. He will not be ordered into set-vice until the re sults of his test are known * or his standing in his class is determined. The draft administrator said that aptitude tests qualifying college stu dents for deferment on the basis of their grades will be repeated at peri odic intervals. So far, only three dates for such tests have been announced--May 26, June 16 and June 30. Reservists Safe This came on the heels of a De fense Department announcement stat ing that no more inactive Army or Air Force Reservists will be called to active duty against their wishes un less there is a ""significant"" change in military manpower needs. Inactive Naval Reservists, it said, will be ordered to duty only when active reservists are not available or when some special skill is needed. These plans were disclosed in a letter from Assistant Defense Secre tary Anna Rosenberg which was read on the House floor by Rep. Overton Brooks (D., La.) during debate on the draft bill. A w arded First Class p ern o r R ating By A.C.P.

Then a half-hour movie presenting the true facts was shown to the stu dents. Following the film, a third test was given to see if the opinions and ideas had changed. The results of this experiment will be used to help establish a form for judging the effect of movies on racial prejudice."

Henderson: Education Increases,
Capacity For Living And Learning,"""Education--What Is Its Value Today?"" was the topic of the speech given of TraauLjeSterdaJ b> Dr' JdegSeph HeHders<>n> President of Bucknell's Board He emphasized the fact that ""the true value of a university education lies not so much in the fact that it pays--although in most cases it will still do that--as in the fact that it increases one's capacity for service and enlarges one's capacity for hap piness."" Dr. Henderson went on to say that by now most students have chosen their career. He said, ""I hope, how ever, in making your choice that it was not based on the idea that any particular calling is already so over crowded that there is no longer any room in it or any more workers, be cause there is still room in every calling for real ability and industry. ""The basis of a career, I believe, de pends primarily upon how honestly and how definitely one desires to work in a particular field. Select what j ou want to do. Live where you want to live, and your success and compensations will be relative. ""One isn't likely to be happy in a career or in a line of work for which he has no linking and he is not likely to be of great service, either to him self or to society if he feels himself a misfit."" He continued by stating that ""Cer tainly there is uppermost in the minds of many of you men students the question, 'Shall I enlist or be draft ed?' I want to compliment the Edi tors of the Bucknellian for its edi torials in its approach to that prob lem. These are difficult decisions to make, but do not overlook the fact that your country needs men of edu cation. I say to you, 'Stay in school as long as you possibly can.' ""Your training will prepare you to fill any position with credit. It is a gift which will serve you in public and support you in private. Whether you serve in private or in public, you are concerned with putting the best into life rather than taking the most out of it."" Dr. Henderson concluded by stating that ""it will not be an easy world"
_,"God forbid--it will be a world full of scars and wounds to be healed and wrongs to be righted--of horrors to be forgotten--of bitterness to be sweetened. It can be made a decent world only if you shall serve and not be served--save and not be saved. I envy your life in it."" mtmm"

"""The Greatest Of Generals Was Douglas""",". . .  So saith one of the many sundry epigrams on Douglas MacArthur to come out of W orld W ar II. TJiis particular ballad goes on to point out some of the various inconsistencies of this famous personality, dwelling for the most part on the general's habit of designing his own uniforms, and climaxing with the sum mation that Douglas is, after all, a vain man. W e mention this, of course, in connection with MacArthur's recent expulsion from the Far East, and to say that from the standpoint of a jumpy citizen we are glad the voters are going to have something to say about future policy in that area. The flood of emotionalism being hamassed by eager politic ians in Washington does not conceal the fact that, his brilliance in guiding Japan's reconstruction notwithstanding, Dugout was too much of an individual, too long a supreme commander to take orders that conflicted with his own military theories. MacArthur, it must be remembered, was responsible to him self. Truman is responsible to the voters. W e re afraid that in this case we must stand up and be count ed with Truman, bumptious buffoon though he is."
About This Honor System . . .,"Now about all this noise we've been hearing about a scholas tic honor system. W e don't think there's any doubt but that an honor system would help Bucknell, both in prestige off campus and as a healthy influence on campus. This much settled, let's think a little bit about the scope of an honor system. It's an open secret that almost every fratern ity and sorority on campus keeps files of back tests to help in studying. Whether the administration is in the dark about this situation or happily ignores it, is a moot question, but we can probably assume that they take a dim view of it. Would an honor system include reporting the use of these files? On the other side, we have this condition of some students entering an exam with a ream of crib notes, while others of the same I. Q. but more moral integrity take their chances on what they've been able to cram into their heads in the last 24 hours. One is worth a ""B "" going in, the other squeaks out a ""C"". Ob viously, some,""adjustment"" is needed here. These and many other aspects of an honor system at Buck nell deserve considerable hashing over before any resolutions are drawn up and every group on campus owes it to themselves to enter into this problem. ""Voting for members of the Scholastic Honor System Cen tral Committee for next year will take place Monday night at 7 :15 in Larison Living Room."""

B U C K N E L L,"Box 77-- April 15 I Dear Sir: I have been a rather greedy con sumer of the ""Student Voice of Buck nell"" for the last three years. It has taken three years and a  course in Bio. IOO to show me that everything I consumed was not healthy for the body. I shall comment only upon the more digestible tid-bits appearing in the ""Student Voice."" -In my freshman year, the most de sirable features of the ""Voice"" were the editorials, the letters to the editor, and the opinionated column ""World Wide."" As a sophomore, I found the editorializing slightly on the decline; the letters to the editor in a pathetic state of being; and only the column ""World Wide"" gave me any food for thought. This year, I have enjoyed the edi torials immensely; and the letters to the editor have for the most part, been quite stimulating. The only thing lacking is an opinionated col umn similar to ""World Wide."" Why not reinstate such a column j so that we may not lose sight of the 1 national and international scene which is of vital concern to all of us ? Sincerely, John Harmon Ed.'s Note: This office would be glad"

Annual Demie Play,
Set For Weekend,"With the parting of the curtain at 8:15 tomorrow and Saturday nights, at the Lewisburg High School, a 50- year old tradition will be carried on as Delta Upsilon fraternity performs before the students and townfolk with their production of ""Lunatics at Large"" by James Beach. As the name implies, lunatics in a mental home have a leading part in developing the plot which results in the murder of the arch villain. The police inspector who is sent to the scene of the crime is not quite capable of outwitting the criminal, but, need less to say, the culprit is brought to justice after numerous vexing com plications present themselves. James Clitter is directing the play with the assistance of Professor Frank Merritt. Those in the cast are: Bob Kerr, Stan Lippencott, Bob Catherman, George Shepherd, John McFadden, Bub Bretz, Bob Dederer, Fred Wolf, Fred Hunt, Don Ray, Thayer Lyon, Dick Shaw, Foster Wil son, Marshall Goulding and A1 Butler. Tickets are being given away at Keeler's, the Bison, the D. U. House, as well as at the door. *"

TAU BETA PI HOLDS,
INITIATION BANQUET,"Pennsylvania Eta of Tau Beta Pi, national engineering honorary, held their Initiation Banquet at the Hotel Milton last Thursday on the 12th of April. The toastmaster for the pro gram was Professor Leonard A. Dag gett of the Electrical Engineering de partment. Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Warren D. Garman, ad dressed the group. The new members of the honorary are: Prof. Robert A. Gardner, CE; James Emerson Hole, ChE; Martin William Kwasnoi, ME; Edwin Ronald Mighell, CE; John Godley Morrison, EE; George Polinko, Jr., EE; Samuel Reed Pulford, ME; and Donald John Skovholt, ChE. in Bucknell Hall Sunday night. Dr. Cook was referring to the M od-deg era Dance Group's interpretation of the Folies Begere which ""wasn't at all like it is done in Paris."" However, along with the rest of the reviewers in the Critic Forum, he found the show an ""entertaining spec tacle"" and ""very enjoyable."" Gummo Likes Blanchard Gummo's comment was 'I liked the Show', and he praised in particular the chandelier in the din ing room scene with the Count. Mary Johnson found Fifi '<<harming -- delightful', and found the sounds made when Fifi lifted the count's foot especially praiseworthy. Barbara Segelken, student critic, felt that 'Kiss Me Again' was not as romantic as it could have been. More Sex Needed Dr. Manning Smith admired the 'handsome girls', and he felt, too, that 'something else could have been done' to enable that fact to be discernable. The costumes could have been made saucier, but still satisfy the mores of the community. Harvey Powers answered some of the minor things in the show that the critics felt worthy of adverse criti cism, and he particularly lauded Jane Brown's fine job as assistant director. Noteworthy, too, he felt, was Jane Grumbling's fine job of stepping into the part of Fifi overnight. It was she who made dress rehearsal pos sible, while Margie Monzert was fight ing off some flu viruses. She and Sally Graybill singing in the parts of Fifi and Franchette on the Saturday matinee did exceptional jobs. For this ""critic's"" money, the show was well cast, and all the performers were noteworthy. Monzert Impressive The* two leads, Margie Monzert and Dave Norwine, were very impressive. Margie's fine, although not-too-dy- namic voice was wonderful to hear, and Dave made a striking Etienne. Liv Lowery, Jean Grumbling, and Joan Merrill made quite an impres sive trio in the first act, and along with Francios, were all praiseworthy. Lee Fiefer and her troop of dancers, even almost fully clothed as they were, presented a very fine minute and a half 'girlie show.' Stanton Emotes ""Effeminate"" Jim Stanton gave just the kind of performance that would be expected of a typical 'arty' Frenchman, and his ad-lib in Act II of Friday night's performance brought down the house. Betty Clark and Bob Birnbaum were the typical tourists, and they, too played a very convincing part. Bramley Billipp was his usual self, and presented a very convincing, over bearing French count. General Villefranche (Holton Con fer) wasn't too German sounding, and in the words of Dr. Cook, sounded ""Pennsylvania Dutchish"". However, he did a laudable job of presenting a girl-crazy old man. Chuck Mercer sang of the ""Dear Little Girl Who is Good"", along with the chorus, and did a good job of it. Legs Leggy Pat Forlifer presented a very svelte Marie Louise and was en joyable, especially as a cigarette girl. One of the highpoints of the show was the auction of the notorious hat that nobody wanted all through the play. However, when enhanced by a kiss from Fifi, even the count warms up, presenting a very enjoyable scene. The whole show was pleasing, in regards to the lighting, production, acting, and especially costuming. The orchestra was very good, and, under Russell Miller's direction, gave one of the best performances of its existence. According to Pat Wiley, business manager, the show drew 1044 paying spectators."

interest Indicates Battle,"er. The two were chasing Jackie Webber's Texas leaguer which drop ped between them for a double. Southpaw Dave Lucas, lanky sopho more, wrote victory number two into the record book as he twirled a neat five hitter and contributed two hits, one a double, over the eight inning span. His battery mate, big Bob Al bert, chipped in with three singles to lead the Orange and Blue stickman in the hitting department. No Shutout Juniata's lone tally came in the second frame-- after that-- all goose eggs on the scoreboard. They put together a walk, a ground single over second, a sacrifice and a ground out, short to first, to rob Lucas o f a shut out. The Herd picked up one in the fourth, two in the fifth, and had scor ed five in - the eighth with two out when the game was called by mutual consent o f both teams following the unfortunate accident. In the fruitful eighth, the charges of Bill Lane dented the plate five times on only two hits. Ed Feld- kircher, who went the distance for the Indians, got Albert on strikes to start the eighth. Art Long then walked and went all the way to third follow ing Lucas' single over second which was fumbled by McNeal, allowing Lu cas to go to second. Shirk then sent a ground ball toward short which got away from Schetzromof --  "" Handy Andy"" going to second and Lucas and Long scoring. Myers Hits Marty McKibbin was safe on an other error by the unlucky Schetzro mof as he threw low to first. Willie Keay forced Marty at second, but went on to occupy the keystone him self as Hackett's attempted DP relay to first was wild. Abe Powellson also reached first as Simon, hot cor ner guardian for the visitors, muffed his grounder. Brad Myers, the third man in Lane's all sophomore outfield, dropped a Texas leaguer behind third scoring Keay and Powellson. Two pitches later, the fleet Myers stole third. Webber then looped his double into short right center where Zim merman and Hackett collided. The game was called twenty minutes later without any further play by mutual consent of both teams. While the Lanemen remained unde- defeated in three starts, Coach Smeltz, Penn State alumnus, saw his men go down to their second deeat in three games. The men from Huntingdon hold a 9-7 victory over Indiana State by Chuck Rogers"
TRACK,"Action in the Intramural Track Meet will commence today and Mon day, at 4 g. m. in the Memorial Sta dium. Today, all trials and one mile final will compose the track events. In the field is scheduled the javelin plus the high jump and pole vault if the weather is right, or the broad jump and shotput if a wet day. Finals Monday Monday, all track finals other than the one mile, the discus, and the two other field events not staged Thurs day will complete the program. There has been much interest shown in this year's meet and it should be a typically close affair. Most of the participants have been training regularly, have the kinks ironed out, and warn that a good many intramural records may fall. The order of events is as follows: Thursday Track-- 220 yds.-- (Trials) 100 yds.-- (Trials) 440 yds.-- (Trials) 1 mile-- FINAL 220 yds.-- (Trials) 220 L. H.

In Penn Relays April 27-28,"by Howard Macauley Six Bison thinclads are currently churning the cinders in preparation for Ilucknell's annual Penn Relay appearance in the Middle Atlantic One-Mile Championship contest which will be run on April 27. Bucknell has not won this coveted1 crown since they swayed the tide in 1936 with a 3 minute and 29.7 second performance. Starting Quartet Four varsity speedsters, A1 Farina, John Schaumberg, Jim Thorn and Art Kearney, will be making their inaug ural emigration to the Ben Franklin Carnival; however, Jim LePard and John Robeson flashed the Orange and Blue baton on the Philadelphia oval last season. Schaumberg, Farina, Robeson and LePard will constitute Coach "" Bus"" Blum's starting quartet, while Thorn and Kearney will battle for the squad's alternate position. Farina and Schaumberg, both seniors, loom as the only tracksters of the present contingent who will be unable to compete next season. Among the Thundering Herd's 21 opponents will be such standout relay teams as St. Joseph, Swarthmore, Muhlenberg, La Salle, Lafayette, Gettysburg and Lehigh Colleges. Swarthmore College annexed the event in 1949 with a 3 minute and 26.7 second clocking, which fell only five seconds short o f the relay carni val record set by* Union College in 1930 for this particular class. Counts In MATFC With the possibility that more than 11 teams, which have applied for positions in the event, report,, there will be two sections of the race, with the final team standing calculated on. the basis of the times reconded in each leg. This program is also of ficially part of the Middle Atlantic Track and Field Championships which, will be held May 18 and 19 at B alti more, Md., and will count in the scor ing of that championship."

Bullets Blasted By Bison Attack;,
Prime For Panthers Next Week,"by Harry Staley The Gettysburg tennismen went down to defeat before a smashing, hard-serving Bisons squad 9-0 yester day on the University courts. . Hank Peters' charges, playing their second' match of the season on home ground, displayed excellent form in white washing the Bullets. Two Forfeits; Led by their two stalwart perform ers, Paul Remmey and Gray Rogers, captain, the Orange and Blue netmen conquered their opponents in seven matches, the last two sets being for feited by the Bullets. All six singles went the Bison way as well as the ,one doubles match. In the opening match Paul Rem mey, number one man for the Herd, had little trouble in downing the Bul lets number one man, Hunter Mc Clure. McClure appeared off edge and inexperienced as he proved easy pickin's for Remmey. Remmey play ed well at the net and his powerful serve stopped McClure 6-2 in the initial set and 6-0 in the second set. Rogers Impressive The second event saw Gray Rogers, captain of the Herd and number two man, swamp Gene Coder of G-Burg, 6-1, 6-1. Rogers displayed a blister ing serve and capped his game with excellent volleying. Coder, star for ward on the Bullet basketball team and end on their football squad, play ed well but was handicapped by a pulled muscle. The third singles went to Bill Reitz as he dumped the number three man for Gettysburg, Hank Greybill. This match however, saw the Bullets take their first set. Reitz had a little trouble winning 6-3 in the first set and then Greybill took the second set [6-1. However, Reitz regained his winning form in the third and final ;set an he triumphed 6-1. The back- court play of Reitz was instrumental in his victory. Hess Wins Skip Hess experienced difficulty in stopping George Proctor, his Bullet opponent, but won in two sets, 6-3, 6-4. Proctor made things tough but the fine all-around play of Hess was the difference. Bill Goff then took over the reins for the Herd and manhandled his Gettysburg opponent, Fred Rice 6-2, 6-4. Goff's serve had the Bullet rac- ketman in trouble throughout the match and only in the second set did Goff find it necessary to put on the pressure. In the final singles action of the afternoon, Muff Mufson came from behind to keep the Bison slate clean. The sophomore netman dropped his first set 6-8 tp John Clark, Bullet tennisman but quickly rebounded with 6-4, and 6-1 victories. Mufson got off to a slow start but in the second set found the range and ap plied the clincher. His superior back- court play and powerful serve kept the G-Burg athlete in trouble throu ghout the final two sets. Bison Duo Wins In the doubles action, Bill Goff and Skip Hess teamed for the Bisons to defeat Hunter McClure and Hank Greybill 6-2, 6-1. Goff's hard serve handcuffed the Bullet duo and Hess consistently captured the net position to keep the visitors in danger. Remmey and Reitz were slated to play Gene Coder and John Clark in the second doubles match but Coder"

Decision Of Campaign;,
Win 5-4 Over Bullets,"Coach Harold Evan's golfers scored victory number two yesterday as they chipped by the Gettysburg Bullets 5-4 on the University Course. In the first moursome out it was Bison all the way as the Orange and Blue's number one man, Bill Allen, downed Plantz of the Battlefielders 3-2. To make the scoring a bit light er for the bookkeepers, Russ Long came through with a 5-4 win over Runkle of G-Burg. The hosts won best ball in the foursome 5-4. Drop Two At this point the pressure began to be evident. The Bison was not so lucky in the second stretch as both of the home linksmen dropped their matches. Shearer of G-Burg downed Ben Hoffman 6-5 as his teammate up set Vannie Johnson two up. The visi tors took honors in the foursome; two up for the best ball. Stark Under Pressure On the eighteenth hole Bison Ted Slark found the situation to be some what the saine as it was on the first tee, all tied up. Ted managed to decision Wagener one up on the nine teenth hole. The secret to the match as a long tee and a fine second shot, both played with plenty of control."

The Herd's Larson and Diffendafer were slated to meet Proctor and Rice in the final doubles action of the afternoon but the Get tysburg coach withdrew his duo and the Bisons blanked the Bullets 9-0. In further action next week the Bisons will meet Muhlenberg at Al lentown Saturday and then tangle with the Pitt Panthers on the home courts next Friday.
Lanemen Will Meet,
Engineers Tomorrow;,
Midshipmen Wednesday,"Within the next week, the Bisons with their 3-0 record, will confront two of the sternest foes of the current baseball season. These two squads, Lehigh and Navy, were both van quished by the Lanemen last year, and are definitely seeking revenge. Eleven Return Lehigh will be met tomorrow on Mathewson field at 3:30 p. m. The Engineers have practically an all vet eran team, with 11 lettermen on the roster. They are gunning for the Middle Atlantic Conference title, for which they were beaten out by BU in the final of last year's MAC tourna ment, 4-2. Dick Roush is slated to take the mound against the Engineers, whom he has halted for two years in a row. He allowed them but two hits in last spring's championship meeting. Strong Mound Staff Lehigh has three hurlers back from last season, including Gratton (also on the basketball team) and Leid- heiser, the pair who shared the pitch ing chores in last year's battle. There will be a veteran in every position but catching. Navy, a non-league foe, will be met at Annapolis next Wednesday. The Middies were on the short end of a 7-6 score in last April's meeting.

"Tennismen Defeat LaSalle, DuPont;",
Drop Close Decision To Haverford,"by Bill LeMon Hank Peters' tennis team returned to the campus from its second weekend trip of the season late Sunday sporting wins over DuPont Country Club And LaSalle College and a loss to Haverford College. Haverford Wins The first match, played with Haver ford on Friday, was a tight 5-4 loss. Paul Remmey, number one man for the Bisons, won his singles match in two sets as did Gray Rogers. After Bill Reitz dropped his singles, Hess took a hard fought battle from his opponent in three sets. Goff and Mufson then lost their matches. Remmey and Rogers then teamed to take the first doubles duel in two sets. Reitz and Mufson, Goff and Hess suffered defeats in the remain ing doubles action. LaSalle Whitewashed On Saturday the Orange and Blue netmen used their Sunday punch to wallop the LaSalle College racketmen 9-0. Every Bison was triumphant. The last opponent, DuPont Country Club, gave the Bisons trouble in the Sunday match. It was not until the doubles match that the outcome was determined. Remmey won his singles in two sets, Rogers in three and Reitz in two. Hess and Goff lost, but Muf son bounced back with a win to give the Bison$ a lead. In the doubles, Rogers and Mufson lost in two sets as did Hess and Goff. It was the work of Remmey and Reitz winning in two sets, that put the label "" success"" on the trip. Penn State Tennismen Meet Herd Tomorrow With Tight Duel Expected The Penn State tennismen will open their season against the Bison tennis men tomorrow at 3:30 on the Univer sity courts. The Nittany Lions, look ing for their initial win, will meet Hank Peter's netmen who sport a two and four record. Landon vs. Remmey Highlight of the match is expected to be the duel between Owen Landon, captain of the State College squad, and Paul Remmey, number one man for the Orange and Blue. Landon, a Williamsport native, is the mainstay of the Penn State team, having been beaten only twice in 23 starts over a three-year period. Remmey, sophomore star of the Bison squad, has met defeat only once in six collegiate matches in this his first year on the varsity."

STRONG VICTORY OVER,
DICKINSON GOLFERS,"by Jim Douglas The Bucknell golf team opened the 1951 season on Monday with a 6% to 2% victory over Dickinson College on the University Golf Course.

"THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.",
WAA's Annual May Day Program,
Features 'Sidewalks Of New York',"Time was when the mention of May Day evoked thoughts of simpering young females who trotted daintily around the May pole to the tune of ""Here We Go Gathering Nuts, etc."" It was strictly a holiday for corny poets, senti mental old maiden aunts, and bored children. Not so, however, at Bucknell where today's energetic young coeds have contrived to bring about a new face lifting for an old festival. This year May Day has gone modem, and a chorus of Bowery characters, fashion models, and Irish cops promises to bring the ""Sidewalks of New York"" to the banks of the Susquehanna. Conspiring to arouse the spectators from their mia-semester doldrums are a group of acrobatic clowns, Rogu- ettes, and modern dancers, who will represent, respectively, New York night clubs, Radio City, and a sky scraper phantasy. High points on the program will be an acrobatic solo by Mollie Brown and a Hawaiian dance by Elinor Defi- baugh; and there's more Big City so phistication provided in the antics of a group of Brooklyn (it wouldn't be complete without them) boys, sight seeing guides, and tourists. In keep ing with the gay, carnival atmosphere of the festivities, concessions, repre senting Coney Island, will be set up in the gym and operated by members of the various sororities. Those behind-the-scenes workers who are making the program possible include: Miss Brown of the Physical Education Department, who is direct ing the dances; Carolyn Knies, Con cessions; Trudy Knudson, Costumes; Lou Hind, Decorations; Joan Hos- hauer, Ushers; Joan Morris and Isa bel Harris, Programs; Jo Gibbons, Ejections! and Bill Godley, who de signed the programs. Teachers Wanted f Representatives of Baltimore | | County, Maryland, spoke to a 1 | group of Bucknell students recent- | | Iy concerning teaching jobs in I ^Baltimore county."
I,They are particularly interested | | in students desiring secondary | | school positions who would be will- 5 : ing to start in the elementary | | field after a small amount of addi- I 1 tional training. The minimum I 1 salary was set at $3000. 1 | Any interested students should I | contact Dr. Frank Davis of the ed- | : ucation department. |
' WHAT A D A T  PLANNED,
FOR AN INDEPENDENT,
MUSICAL PRODUCTION,"by Joan Lafferandre Betti Schellenberg Near the muddy Susquehanna By the slimy Big Creek water Lived on Buck-Nell reservation Writers fired with inspiration. From within the smoky wigwam Surged the beating of a tom-tom. (Writers no like noisy tom-tom-- Musician now in next-door wigwam.) From one teepee words satiric; From the other lilting lyric. This went on for many moons-- Words apart from pretty tunes. Pounding, pounding on his Royal, Writer stopped to make eraSure. In the stillness and the hushing Music unsurpassed was rushing ""Ah!"" said Writer, ""this is pleasing!"" Opportunity I'm seizing! Down with this lone bull I'm slinging! I will go see bull that's singing, Singing Bull makes rhythms pretty. I can make up lyrics witty. Buck-Nell tribe will think, 'Sensation!' We will stage revue of nation!"" The obave passage is from the fam ous ""Hiwatha's Speech on the Possi bilities of an All-American Theatre in the Happy Hunting Grounds at Lewisburgum"". The rest of the speech extols the virtues of the soon- to-be-given Sioux revue, WHATTUM DAY! Of course, the original manu script has been lost, but the pattern remains the same. Two budding young geniuses (genii to the pedants) get together, one with words and the other music, and there you have it! A show is in the making. Right at this very moment this age- old pattern is rearing its ugly head. Several talented Bucknellians are planning the most sensational, the' most colossal, the most--well--indes cribable extravaganza ever to appear in the hallowed halls Lewisburg High School. This is What a Day."

The Mike,"by Jim Hastings WVBU in co-operation with the Liberty Mutual Broadcasting Com pany and station WLRT in Blooms- burg will present a one-half hour re corded broadcast concerning the se lective service plans. The speakers will be Arthur S. Adams, President of the American Council on Education, Henry Chauncey, President of Edu cational Testing Servicfe, and General Lewis B. Hershey, Director of Selec tive Service. Because of the ever-changing policy governing deferments for students (not to mention the threatened man power shortage for the sem-gems) your Radio Workshop will broadcast this transcribed program every Wed nesday evening from 7:30 until 8:00. The purpose of the series of programs is to answer the many 'questions raised in letters, news comments, and editorials, throughout the nation. Just a few days ago, a young ener getic Freshman (Yes, some of them still have ambition) eagerly paced back and forth in front of the impres sive mahogany door leading into the plush conference room where the Board of Directors were casting their votes on a vital issue. This Freshman under question posed a problem which only the master minds of 420 South Seventh Street could answer. After many hours of delib eration, the board reached its crucial decision. And here are its findings!

Gives Advice To Lame And The Halt,"by Bob Bell My head reeled, my throat was scratchy, and I was oppressed with a heavy cold, and feeling as if my hours were numbered, I stumbled into the in- nrmary A bedraggled nurse took one look at me and rushed me to the over flowing isolation ward. In a matter of minutes I had been transformed from a student into a member of the men of ""Bitter Rash."" I had the measles! At 1:10, a nurse took my pulse rate; at 1:15 she took my tempera ture; at 1:19 she took my water pistol. Just then Dr. Whitef-owl rushed in, stuck a tongue depresser in my mouth, put my feet in traction and signed me up for a three-year sub scription for Medical Economics. Af ter the doctor had finished his exam ination and had prescribed a liquid diet for me (my mouth was full of splinters from the tongue depresser and I could not handle solids) he left and his place was taken by the resi dent psychologist. You know what a psychologist is . . .  a crazy 'doctor. Just as he was about to ask me if my mother had ever been frightened by a pin-ball machine, a fellow wearing a Batman costume _ covered with Dewey buttons rushed in and said breathlessly, ""Doc! Doc! I want to speak to you about my brother . . .!"" The Cat hears that STAN KEN TON pulled more paid admissions into the Palladium Ballroom in Holly wood than any other band since 1947.

Rub-down, that's medical jargon for, ""You won't be able to sleep anyhow so you might as well have the odor of alcohol to keep you company."" At 10:30 all the lights were extinguished. (It was all right with me. The candle smoke was burning my eyes). We went to sleep. Now I wouldn't say it was cold in that wing, but about three I could- have sworn that Ad miral Bird licked my hand. Four days passed in much the same manner as the first, and then once again I found myself in the down stairs reception room. While I was waiting for my discharge to clear through the omnipotent channels, I noticed a woman dragging a seven- year-old brat into the doctor's office. ""Doctor,"" she inquired, "" Can a seven- year-old boy take out his own appen dix' ? ""Certainly not,"" humphed the woxthy medic. ""See, Johnny!"" shriek ed the woman, ""I told you so. PUT IT BACK!"" And now at last I'm once again on the outside, and I'd like to pass this bit of advice on to you. If your head aches, your throat is scratchy, and you feel a cold coming on, chances are good that with the proper infirm ary treatment you'll feel great by ... House Party Weekend."

KD'S TO HOLD FORMAL,"The Kappa Delta sorority will hold its annual White Rose Formal Satur day night at the Phi Gam House from 9 to 12. Don Travis and his orches tra will play for the dance. Rev. Tom Richards "". . . chapel speaker"" With the help of the former Lewis- burg Federal Penitentiary chaplain, Thomas Richards, the Men's Service Center, formerly the People's Rescue Mission, has given men in need new aims and new hopes. This organiza tion's policy is not to run a ""flop- house""; but a social agency for desti tute men who have skidded to the depths and need the heart to fight back. The mission is kept spotless at all times, and also provides the men with a neat and commodious chapel, a lounge and recreation room. In 1949, first full year of the cen ter's operation under the new regime, services were provided for 1,088 men. Tom Richards says that state unem ployment and the state's welfare or ganizations have reduced the number of clients greatly. Tom Richards is well known to many Bucknellians, having spoken at Chapel on various occasions, and also has been an assistant in the Religion Department."

Movie Chatter,"by Babs Fiedler Thursday and Friday at the Cam pus Theater is the ""Prince of Peace"", I know nothing about it, except it is done up in cinecolor and is of a re ligious nature. On the risk of being called a psychothenic, I don't  think there is a great deal to it. However, if you're the type that wears religion on your sleeve instead of in your heart, this picture is just your meat. O * H<< * 4c Saturday at the Campus, and Fri day and Saturday at the Capitol in Milton is ""Royal Wedding."" It stars Jane Powell, Peter Lawford, Fred Astaire and Sarah Churchill, and is filmed in beautiful techniclor. Janie and Fred are a dance team (brother and sister) and travel to London dur ing the week of the royal wedding to do a show. On the boat, popular Janie finally meets her match in Peter Lawford, and while in London, Fred falls for Sarah, who is a dancer in the show. It's a sugary musical, but good. Janie breaks into song at the oddest moments, but her singing is lovely. Fred does some pretty fancy dancing which makes up for his un- inspiring' voice, while Sarah's grace in dancing makes up or Janie's lack of it, and Peter Lawford just looks pretty. Whew! * * e * * Thursday, Friday and Saturday at the Strand in Sunbury is ""Inside Straight"" starring David Brian and Arlene Dahl. It's about a rich gamb ler in the late nineteenth century and looks like it might supply a mild catharsis."

Draft Eligible College Students,
Urged To Take Aptitude Tests,
Regardless Of Scholastic Rating,"""It is urgent that all draft-eligible college students take the forthcoming aptitude test regardless of their scho lastic standing,"" stated Brig. Gen. Louis H. Renfrow, deputy draft direc tor in a recent radio address. He was concerned, he said, about i eports that students were not apply ing to local draft boards for the ex amination cards as rapidly as they should. Many, he added, had decided against taking the test because they were afraid of making a poor score. General Renfrow, who is second only to Maj. Gen. Lewis H. Hershey in the draft set-up, declared it was vitally important for everyone eli gible for the test to take it."" Later, he put it more strongly and said each eligible student ""must take the test and have it in his files."" The Policy To Date Heretofore the attitude of the Se lective Service has been that a stu dent may take the aptitude test or may depend entirely on his scholastic standing. The agency has announced that draft boards may base defer ments of college students next fall either on the score they make in the aptitude test or on their general scho lastic standing. General Renfrow stated that the change of one word--""or"" to ""and"""
_,"may require the use of both stand ards instead of one or the other. In that event, he pointed out, the draft board that has no test score for"
#&,"student seeking deferment will have to order his induction. The House version of the new draft bill--which is awaiting adjustment with the Senate measure--specifies that draft boards are not to be bound | by results of the aptitude tests. The tests are to be given May 26, June 16 and June 30, at more than 1,000 examination centers, including Bucknell. A fourth date, for men who cannot take the examination on a Saturday because of their religious beliefs, will be set for some time in July. Aid Asked On the same broadcast program as General Renfrow, Dr. Arthur"
S.,"Adams, president of the American Council on Education, said that organ ization had asked all college presi dents and registrars to urge every draft-liable student to take the test. Dr. William W. Trunbull, Prince ton, N. J., vice president of the Edu cational Testing Service which is in charge of the examination program, said that 50,000 applications had been received to date. He added that no amount of cramming would help a student to pass the test, and study time might best be used in trying to improve scholastic standings. | Men Can Register in VA Office"

What A Day,
FRENCH COMEDY AND NEW,
MUSICAL,
SLA FOR MA Y,
Leocadia,"Bucknell will see the United States premiere of the French comedy ""Leo cadia"" on May Day weekend, May 12- 13. The play was translated from the French by Mary Ann Ziegler and Marian Snnius with the help of Dr. Douglas Orrok and Cecile Constans. Dick Osborn is to direct the play, and the cast is as follows: Prince, Dick Larson; Duchess, Hope Lan drum;; Hector, Web Smith; Maitres number one and two, Frank Hoffman and Bob Birnbaum; Inn Keeper, Bramley Billipp, and Taxi Driver, Nick Schloeder. The contemporary French author, Jean Anoulin, was extremely difficult to contact for copywright release, and royalty arrangements. Letters to Paris proved to be of no avail, and even trans-Atlantic telephone calls had to be made to secure the neces sary technical and legal bindings. An English translation was for warded to Anoulin's office in Paris."
APO Sets Quota,
Of 150 Donors,
For Blood Drive,"Blood will flow freely in Hunt Hall this Tuesday--at least Alpha Phi Omega, national Service fraternity, in conjunction with the American Red Cross, hope it will. With a quota of 150 donors to meet in the current blood drive, Tom Moth- era!, chairman, along with Bill Hans- man and Dave Levenson, heading the Distribution and Recruiting Commit tees, have been securing pledges the last few weeks. Publicity chairman Jim Justice has seen to it that the need for blood has been brought to the attention of every Bucknellian. Refreshments Students between 18-21, who have their parents' consent, and the other donors will converge upon Hunt Hall between 2:00 and 8:00 p. m., where, as part of the Volunteer Serv ices committee's job, headed by Herb Zearfoss, fruit juice will be served be fore donations and coffee or tea after. According to Harold Hayden, APO faculty adviser, and campus Red Cross representative, the bloodmobile, a fully equipped unit, designed for this purpose, will be here with nurses and technicians to do the actual work. Once the blood is collected, it will be shipped to the Wilkes-Barre blood bank. For Local Use ""That blood,"" Mr. Hayden explain ed, ""will go partly to the armed ser vices, but much of it will be used right here. Hospitals in Lewisburg and Sunbury, for instance, will be able to furnish blood without cost to those who need it. ""Formerly,"" he continued, ""patients who couldn't find a volunteer donor would have to buy the blood."""

Content of news stories was noted as clear and specific and free from non-essential facts. Front page make-up was reported to be attractive and inviting. The judges marked the editorial page as having handled good campus topics which were of general interest to the student body and constructive in purpose. School sports were given credit as being complete and inter- estng as well as having proper em phasis.

A Little Brotherhood,"Lewisburg is aglow this week, the result of one fraternity's example of community service and spirit. In accepting a part of the community responsibility the men of Sigma Alpha Epsilon spent a recent Saturday, as a group, in service to the community. The local welfare board supplied the group with a list of the three neediest cases in this area and left the rest to the fraternity. The result is still a widespread topic of conversation in town and it made the papers in nearby communities. News stories have attempted to describe the job done by the men but none can describe the joy they created in the hearts of those people who received their help. This is just one of the more recent instances of a reawaken ing of fraternities to their duties and responsibilities to the com munity. The Christmas parties for underprivileged children, picnics for orphans and support of the many charitable drives are other methods by which fraternity men are demonstrating their awareness to community need. There is still room for improvement but progress is being made. There are instances throughout the nation that fraterni ties realize the bad publicity they received from overzealous Hell \\ eek activity, excessive drinking, etc., and are out to correct the The Lewisburg incident is just one example of good fratern ity relationship. h. 1. s."

Sincerely, Sylvia Harbaugh Mary Ann Bice More On Class Changes April 28, 1951 Dear Mr. Editor: A few weeks ago a letter appeared in the Bucknellian from a student, who had been completely blocked in an at tempt to change a course which he had no desire to take, in favor of one which he felt would be o f more ser vice to him. At that time he had my sympathy because I, too, as well aware of the uselessness o f trying to make sense out of anything that has to do with planning a helpful cur riculum. Now I sympathize even more, having just beat my head on the proverbial brick wall. My com plaint is slightly different however. In part the fault is mine, but 1 strong ly feel that the lump I am sporting on my head can in part be attributed to what our catalogue calls our ""ad- visers."" Earlier this year I was patting my self on the back because I felt that after two years 3 was finally able to translate and understand the Cata logue. Now I hide my face in shame when 1 realize the audacity I had in assuming any such thing. I won't bore you with the details, but it boils down to this: in spite of an earnest effort to keep track of the subjects I have taken and to arrange them in a logical order, .1 find that according to * the notice we have just received I ! have been suffering under tremendous I illusions eoncming the amount of ""required work"" that I had completed. (You need shed no tears-- I April 19, 1951 To the Editor: Editorial, "" The Greatest of Gen erals Was Douglas,"" true-- and too much of a military man to stand by and watch American lives being snuff ed out by a barbaric tribe o f men to whom life means little if anything. Already 10,080 Americans have been killed while 10,766 more are missing, most o f which are most like ly dead, add to that 38,550 men who have been injured and you have a total of 59,396 American casualties (Time 4/23/51). I dare say this is more than 10 times those of any other country with men in Korea. All this and you would stand with a "" bumpti ous buffoon"" who would not allow the one person that knows the Korean situation best to have at least a major ay in its policy. His hands have been tied since the beginning of the war. Would you tie his feet and gag him? How can a reneral, even as one as great as he is, ight a war, and this is war (see a dictionary), when all the rules are I made for his side only? True, very true, Truman is account able to the voters, but MacArthur is accountable to the troops and after all they, not the voters in this country are doing the fighting and more than that he is also accountable to the mothers o f those who will never re turn. Must we, because o f Trumans appeasement policy, live not knowing where we will be tomorrow and we are facing just that, note the bests being given and the numerous re cruiting men on this campus from time to time. While my policy is obviously no better than MacArthurs it is such that if we are going to fight why not use all methods and means at our disposal to effect the cessation of hos tilities short o f barbaric methods, an we win if we cannot bomb y  bases wherever the enemy might choose to hide, if we cannot even take aerial photographs of the enemy positions because they are be hind a man made boundary? It is to be remembered that this conflict, if you would call it such, is more than U. N. police action, for if it was to remain as such we should have never crossed the 38th parallel. We have committed ourselves and now that we have we must back up our decision with force at once or GET OUT OF KOREA NOW and live to fight an. other day as in that event we most certainly will have to. Allan H. Jodrey How milil time to get it done). But why have I been suddenly disillusioned? Be cause 1 was on occasions misinformed, I did not understand the (sometimes hidden) meaning of statements in the Catalogue, and this illustrious person triio is referred to as an adviser has made no effort whatsoever to see that I was on the right track. (As a mat ter of fact I have had four advisers. If I'm ever hard up for a job I will feel qualified to apply to any circus for work as a juggler's ball-- I've had lots of experience). I know you have many things on your minds, dear Faculty members, but please, please read the catalogue, try to understand it, and if you find it necessary don't hesitate to call upon Miss Henderson for help. That's what the rest of us end up doing most of the time anyway. Think o f the time you might save her! And just on the side think o f the opportunity there might be to help maintain the >>anity of the world's up and coming leaders. Yours truly, (Name withheld by request). #d"

Bosa Exhibition Attracts,
Many As Works Are Praised,"by Constance Jenrich Louis Bosa, Italian born artist, exhibited his widely acclaimed work, and lectured in Roberts Hall to about 100 people on Sunday afternoon, April 22. Bruce Mitchell, Bucknell's artist in residence, was host for the art de partment at the affair. Mr. Bosa's pictures have been reproduced and his work criticized in an issue of LIFE Magazine. The artist, a dark haired, pleasant littlp man, did a painting in oils of the city hall of Lewisburg, while the group of faculty, students and town residents looked on. As he painted from a sketch which he had previous ly made of the building, Mr. Bosa carefully explained the basic tech niques involved. His audience laugh ed more than once at the natural humor he displayed in his talk. Used Dark Canvass He painted on a darkened canvas, saying that he could read more depth and mood into a scene that way, than if he were to work on a glaring white background. He emphasized the need for relaxation and intense interest in the subject, if the artist expects to produce a picture with movement' of line in it. He blocked in the larger shapes of the painting at first, and then freely spread the predominating colors over a wide area on the canvas. By using a slender trowel, he effortlessly blend ed the shades into the grey sky of a rainy day, and almost in one broad stroke of red-brown, recreated the city hall. Big Noses The expressions on the faces of the figures he had drawn, suggested that he has perhaps a satirist's attitude toward the human race, for he had portrayed them with wide, frightened eyes, and elongated noses, so as to give them a sort of clownish appear ance. He used bright colors in vivid contrasts in his landscapes and floral groups, but preferred the dullness of a grey sky in several scenes which involved people. On the whole, his work easily pro jected the moods he had captured, which had much to do with the popu larity of his work among the group that viewed it. Refreshments were served, and an informal discussion period concluded the afternoon."

To Phi Betes,""" Scientists do not start wars,"" stated Dr. Harlow Shapley, director of the Harvard Observatory, in clos ing his speech before an open meeting of Phi Beta Kappa Thursday night in Lit. auditorium. The title of his talk, which consist ed mainly of personal anecdotes, was "" Science in International Affairs."" One of his stories described the in- temational set-up of a group fighting the tsetse fly in the Congo. Another told how the cooperation needed to start an American-Mexican observa tory helped smooth over the oil-ex ploitation trouble. Addressing himself to the new PBK initiates, Dr. Shapley described man's position in the universe: "" on a minor ' planet of an'average star on the rim of one of millions of galaxies."" "" We are peripheral ephemerals,"" he remarked, "" which is a good thing to remember when our Phi Beta Kap pa keys are new and shiny."" Waxing romantic, Dr. Shapley re lated how a Russian girl with whom he corresponded (to give her practice in English) became interested in as tronomy, developed into the outstand ing pupil in Russia, and wound up by marrying the chief Soviet astronomer. Dr. Shapley touched on the oppor tunities available as a ''scientific mis sionary."" He also described cross publication, by which American ad vances in science are made known to foreigners, and vice-versa."

"Navy Broadside Sends Herd Down To Second Defeat, 14-6",
Midshipmen Blast Bison Hurlers;,
"Roush, Albert Homer in Lost Cause","by Ellwood Rowe Taking their cue from pitcher Vic Kricchi, who hurled four hit ball, the Midshipmen from Annapolis weighed anchor on Bill Lane and Company yes terday and sailed away with a 14-6 victory. The contest was called at the end of seven and one-half innings to enable the Middies to make a late chow. Bisons Homer"
Delta Upsilon Collects,
73 Points In Intramural,
Track To Slice KS Lead,"Southpaw Vic Kricchi, a little shaky in the second and third frames when he served up home run balls to Dick Roush and Bob Albert, apparently re covered his ""land legs"" again and didn't allow a hit the remainder of the game from the fourth inning on. Behind him, his mates jumped on three B. U. pitchers for 12 hits. Dick Roush, the starting and losing pitcher, was touched for six runs and six hits in the one and one-third innings that he worked. Bud Bretz making his first college appearance replaced Roush and work ed three and one-third frames giving up seven runs and five hits. Lefty Dave Lucas, who already has two wins to his credit, finished the game and allowed one hit and one run, a homer by Florio Moretti to deep cen ter in the fifth, during his stint on the hill. Lanemen Start Fast The Orange and Blue of Bill Lane got off to a fast start in the second inning scoring three runs after being held scoreless in the first. Bruisin' Roush Albert Bob Albert, who had one for three for the day, led off with a walk to start the uprising. Marty McKibbin, who had 2 of the 4 Bucknell hits then smashed a single through the middle. Bricchi then tightened a little and fanned Keay and Long in succession. Then he made the fatal mistake of grooving one for Dick Roush, hard hitting pitcher, who promptly clouted the horsehide to deep left-center and the Herd picked up the first three runs. After fanning Webber and Myers, Kricchi walked Abe Powelson. Al bert plated Powelson as he clouted his first homer of the year. That ended the Herd scoring until the eighth when they picked up a run on two walks, a force out and another force out. Middies Blast Navy's big barrage of runs and hits blared forth in the second frame. When all the smoke and dust had cleared, the Middies found themselves with 7 runs on 7 hits as 11 men pa raded to the plate. Leading the at tack for the winners was Frank Chaco, first baseman, who collected two doubles during the uprising. Bucknell"

Varsity Tennismen,
Defeat Muhlenberg 8-1,"by Harry McSorley The varsity tennis team scored an impressive victory over Muhlenberg College last Saturday, winning by a score of 8-1 on the Allentown courts. Muhlenberg's outmanned squad prov ed to be no match for Coach Hank Peters' netmen, whose record at pres ent stands at three wins against five setbacks. Sweep Singles The Bisons swept the singles matches, scoring six points on decisive victories by Paul Remmey, Bill Reitz, Maurice Mufson, Chuck Larson, John Hess, and A1 Goff. In the doubles, the combinations of Remmey-Reitz and Mufson-Larson were victorious to account for the final two Bucknell points. Goff and Hess were edged in the final set by their Muhlenberg op ponents to prevent the Bisons from scoring a complete shutout. by Bruce Swanger Bill Lane's baseball team tasted defeat for the first time Friday on the local diamond 5-3, as they fell before Dick Gratton's clever four hit hurling | and the 11 hit attack of his revenge seeking, Lehigh team mates. Victory Sweet deg * Last year Bucknell knocked the Engineers out of the MAC tourna ment, 4-2, making Friday's victory doubly sweet for Lehigh. They avenged that defeat and at ?he same time hurdled one of the main ob stacles to their MAC championship aspirations for the current season. I The 5-3 loss was the first for the [.Bisons in four starts. Their oppon- I ents have a three up and four down record. Engineers Score First The Engineers served notice of | their intentions early as they scored | twice in the first. Lead-off batter Gigon was the first man to reach base, when one of Dick Roush's fast balls hit him on the el- j bow. This evidently upset Dick, for | he served up a fat pitch to Borofski, who promptly socked it into the deep left center for two bases and a run batted in. Gabriel slapped a grass j cutter to Shirk, and Andy booted it. I Borofski scored and Gabriel advanced i to second on the eTror. Brach kept i the rally alive with a sharp ground i single in the hole between third and I short, but Gabriel was thrown out at I the plate on a beautiful throw by I Webber when he tried to score from i second on the hit. Collins pushed | Brach around to third with a single j over second, but it was wasted as i Roush settled down and retired the I next two men. Powelson Tallies The Lanemen tallied for the first i time in the second when Abe Powel son, first man up, slashed a double by Howard Macauley Bucknell's fast-stepping one-mile relay team will usher in the 1951 track season tomorrow afternoon when they match strides with nine competitors in the College Class Mile Relay at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, in the 56th annual Penn Relays. On Saturday afternoon the Orange and Blue speedsters will make their second carnival appearance, competing in the Middle Atlantic Collegiate Mile Re lay. Bus Says ""Farr"""
J,"Coach ""Bus"" Blum, hesitant to I elicit any quick or optimistic opinion, I related that the squad, composed of # captain John Schaumberg, A1 Farina, Jim LePard, Jim Thorn and Jack Ro beson, is a ""fair"" mile crew and he further related that relay develop ments are difficult to forecast. The cinder tutor, who is now rounding his fourth season at the track helm, also commented that the Bison quartet has "" I been placed in two ""tough"" heats, when the catcher threw the ball into Bus has not officially announced the center field trying to pick him off starters, although it is apparent that second. Myers then lofted a high fly I Schaumberg, Farina and LePard are to deep left field, and Abe tagged up | certain to constitute three-fourths of the squad. In the College Class over third. He advanced to third and scored after the catch. Lehigh picked up another run in the third, when they put together a single*by Brach and a triple by Col lins. In the bottom half of the inning, Bucknell tied it up by scoring twice on one hit. Long led off with an Annie Oakley, and advanced to the keystone when Roush smashed a single past third.! Shirk bounced to Collins, who stepped ! an third to retire Long, but in at- [ tempting a double play he threw th e. ball over the first baseman's head. { The runners stopped at second and j third. McKibbin went down swing ing. With two out the runners were moving when Keay bounced a ball to | Kelly. He bobbled it momentarily, and ball, runner and the pitcher cov- | ering first arrived at the initial sack at the same time. The resulting col lision allowed both Roush and Shirk i to score before Gratton could extri- | cate himself from the wreckage. That ended the scoring for Buck-1 nell. Lehigh went ahead to stay with j single runs in the fifth and sixth. Each pitcher walked two and struck i out four. Dick Roush collected two of the four Bison hits. Powelson doubled and Keay singled for the other two. Lehigh"

The Bisons drew third lane for this mad scramble, while the nine aforemen tioned teams are listed in their re spective starting positions. Farieigh-Dickinson, this season's pole"" team, captured second plaPSe in their event last year, as Delaware snared a third. However, each sea son the schools entered in this class relay are divided into various sec tions so that no institution can. dbmi- nate any particular field. The Middle Atlantic Collegiate One-Mile contest on Saturday after noon will draw the curtain on Buck- nelTs 1951 thrust for relay honors in the Ben Franklin Circus. Competing with the Herd in the second section of the two division race will be such foes as LaSalle, Delaware, Gettys burg, Alfred, St. Joseph, Lafayette, Johns Hopkins, Ursinus, Swarthmore and Washington Colleges. T h e Orange and Blue baton passers drew ninth position in this event, with their competitors starting in the previously mentioned order. Unusual Drawing Alfred sped to a 3 minute 25:4 second victory last year in this event with Johns Hopkins and Washington College placing second and third re spectively. Unusual drawing has placed last season's three top quar tets in the same section, even though the coveted title is awarded on the basis of the best time recorded in either division.

Netmen Bow To State;,
Landon Defeats Remmey,"by Art Harrison A strong Penn State tennis team led by their ace Owen Landon defeat ed the Bison netmen 6-3 on the Uni versity Courts last Friday. Remmey Defeated Paul Remmey, number one man for the Herd, met Landon in the first match and went down to defeat in straight sets, 6-1, 6-2. Landon, who has been beaten only twice in 23 starts, played a smart and acurate game in downing his Orange and Blue opponent. Remmey was fine around the nets. Gray Rogers, Bison captain, went down to defeat at the hands of the hard-hitting Wieland, 6-4, 6-2."
Bison Golfers Drop Three Matches,
As Season Opens On Note Of Defeat,n
_,"_____ by Jim Douglas The Bucknell golf team saw defeat three times in the last week when they lost to Navy 6 to 1 and Mary land 8 to 1 over the weekend and on Tuesday Temple beat the divoters 6 to 3. All three matches were played away from home. The golfers' rec ord is now two wins in five starts. Ben Hoffman was the only Buck- nellian to register a win against Maryland as he defeated Bob Swein- weddle two up. The golfers from Maryland were too much for the other men since they swept all five of the other matches. Bill Allen was de feated 6 and 5, Russ Long lost one up on the nineteenth, and the home team took the best ball 2 and 1. In the second foursome, Hoffman won, but Vannie Johnson lost one up as Maryland again won best ball one up. Ted Stark and Larry Breakiron lost one up and 7 and 6 respectively. The hosts won best ball three and two to win the match 8-1. Navy Swingers Potent The divotmen did not fare any bet ter down at Navy as they lost 6-1. Number one man, Bill Allen, and Russ Long, playing second, lost two heartbreakers 5 and 4 and 6 and 5. There was not any best ball counted in the match. It was the same case in the second foursome as Ben Hoff man lost 5 and 4 and Vannie Johnson was defeated by the tune of two up. Art Goulding, playing for the first time with the team, won the only match of the day, one up. But Buck,- nell, playing a seven man team, lost the last two matches with Larry Breakiron and Ted Stark on the short ends of the scores of 5 and 4 and 9 and 8. Bow To Temple Owls Coach Evans' men just couldn't jump out in front in the scoring and lost on the last foursome to Temple 6-3 on Tuesday. The Temple golfers led the whole way and the Bucknell- ians couldn't overcome the deficit. Temple's number one man started the scoring with a 3 and 2 victory over Bill Allen. But then Russ Long came back to tie up the score by virtue of a 6 and 5 win. Temple took best ball one up to take the lead. After Ben Hoffman had lost two and one, Van nie Johnson won 3 and 2 to enable Bucknell to take -the best ball one up. The score was tied once again, but Temple took two matches in the last foursome to take the lead which was good enough to take the match. The two Temple men defeated Ted Stark three and two and Bill Grim 5 and 4 to win best ball 3 and 2. Final score, six to three for Temple. The Bucknell golfers will attempt to register their third win of the sea son against Lafayette on Saturday on the University Golf Course. In last week's Bucknellian, it was stated that Ben Hoffman had been elected this year's captain of the golf team. This was a mistake since Bill Allen and Russ Long have been nam ed co-captains. Navy 6--Bucknell 1 Maryland 8--Bucknell 1 Temple 6--Bucknell 3"
Pitt And Lafayette Face Bisons,
As Tennismen Gird For Invasion,"The Bison tennis squad will meet netmen from Pittsburgh and Lafay ette on the home courts this Friday and Saturday, prior to departing for a match with Penn State nextWed- nesday. In spite of the calibre of the forthcoming competition, Hank Peters, Bucknell coach, believes that his squad will do enough winning to begin evening a 3-5 season's record. Warmer weather, the passing of the measles epidemic, and the absence of injuries, have left the Orange and Blue at full strength. With Captain Gray Rogers back in action and Paul Remmey reaching his peak, the squad will be tough to beat. The Bison coach stated that the Pittsburgh squad will be the toughest ever faced by Bucknell racquet-men."

Tustin Tales,"by Sue Joos The field of contestants for both the badminton and tennis tournaments is being slowly but surely narrowed down as the second round get under way. The second round of badmin ton must be played off by tomorrow. Those still in the running are: DZ,, Pi Beta Phi, Tri-Delt, and the teams that received a ""bye"" for the first round, KD, Phi Mu, KKG, and BISA. The second round of the tennis tournaments must be played off by Monday, April 30. As of this issue, only two games have been played-- Phi Alpha Pi defeating Phi Mu, and KD defeating Alpha Phi. The softball tournament begins next Monday also, as a climax for all the baseball fiends seen practicing at Tustin, with occasional (?) interrup tions from the weather. At 4:30 Phi Mu will play Pi Beta Phi and BISA will challenge DZ. The following day (and the first day of May), it will be Alpha Chi versus Phi Alpha Pi, and Alpha Phi versus KKG. Attention Golfers! All first round intramural golf matches must be played by the 29th of April. The match scores must be reported on the master sheet in the club house."

New O.C.S. Naval Reserve School,
Now Open To College Graduates,"The Navy will open a new officer candidate school at Newport, Rhode Island in early June for 300 aspirants to Naval Reserve commissions, it was announced recently. The new program will be open to civilians and enlisted men from the Naval Reserve and from the regular Navy. The new school will be simi lar to the World War II V-7 schools. It will present a program under which candidates upon completion of the four- month course will receive indoctrination training at Monterey, California, and then they will receive their Ensign commissions in the reg ular Navy. Before entering the school candi dates must agree to serve on active duty, if commissioned, for three years, and to retain their reserve commis sions for at least eight years, includ ing active duty time. 4-Year Hitch Civilians who participate will be enlisted in the Naval Reserve for four years. If they do not successfully complete the course they will serve on active duty in an enlisted capacity for a period which will satisfy Selec tive Service requirements current at the time. Unsuccessful reserve and regular naval candidates will revert to their fprmer status. Students will hold the newly ap proved rank of Officer Candidate, and will receive pay equal to that of a seaman recruit. If they belong to the reserves, they will continue to re ceive pay at their former rate. Requirements # Requirements for civilians include a classification o f 1-A, 1-A-P, 1-D, 2- A, 2-C, 3-A, or 4-B. Veterans must have honorable discharges, or if they are in the Naval Reserves and on in active duty, they must have records of satisfactory service. Men at least nineteen but not yet twenty-six years of age are eligible. All applicants must hold Baccalau reate degrees from an accredited col lege. However, applications may be submitted 120 days prior to expected receipt of such a degree. Courses in mathematics through trigonometry (secondary school or college level) and the usual citizenship and physical qualifications are a prerequisite. Monthly Classes Future classes will convene every other month with 300 students in each class. Civilians and Naval Re serves on inactive duty should apply Officers Procurement. Three Bucknell undergraduates, John William Bersch III, John A r thur Douglas, and Daniel Edgar Nes- ter, have already successfully com pleted applications for Officer Candi date Training during the current aca demic year."

Means,"m m m m i m m THURSDAY, APRIL 26, 1951. by Bobbie Maurer . A "" a' ive of Lew'sburg, Dr. Irland, professor of Electrical Engineering has resided here most of his life. He attended Lewisburg High SchoS for two yearn, after which he finished at Bucknell Academy in preparation for Bucknell After taking courses in electrical engineering, he graduated from here lit 1915, and it was five years before he returned. The first two following years were spent in industry, as he worked with the Bethlehem Steel Company. After spending tw o months in the Signal Corps during World War I, he went back to the steel plant for a year and a half. While with the army, Dr. Irland did a little flying, testing radio equip ment in small planes. He went up in the air nearly every day for three months, after which he didn't enter a plane for twenty years. It was in the army that he became interested in radio, and in later years he intro duced a radio course here. Married A Bucknellian In 1920, Dr. Irland came here to teach, and has been with us ever since.--over 30 years. A young lady soon came here to teach home eco nomics, and a year later, in 1924, they were married. That same year, Dr. Irland did graduate work at John's Hopkins, and in 1925, attained his master's degree. Without taking a leave of absence, he worked towards his Doctor's degree during his vaca tions and spare time, and received that in 1935. Dr. Irland has worked with the Bu reau of Mines Civil Service during1 summers, both in Pittsburgh and Bos ton. He has also done research on vibrations from blasting, while devel oping a sizometer. No trouble With Doctor Bills Dr. Irland never had trouble with doctor's bills, for he has been quite healthy all his life. He and his wife and four children, Ruth, Edwin, Mar garet, and Barbara, spend many sum mers in Ocean City--that resort so amiliar to many Bucknellians. Hav ing lived along a river, Dr. Irland has been very fond of swimming, and most sports, for that matter. IIIIIIMIMtllMiii"

Automatic con trolling instruments will illustrate the engineering principles applied to wards controlling temperatures, flow rates, and electro thermal measure ments. Several graduate research projects will also be demonstrated, two of which are "" spray drying""  and 'drum drying."" Lastly, different techniques in unit operations will be explained by the Chemical Engineers. Co-chairmen for the organization of these projects are Lewish and Mextz. Harold S. Kircher, Senior ME, was awarded a prize for his paper given April 20, at the Student Branch Con ference (region three) of the A. S- M. E., held at the University of Penn sylvania. His topic was "" Practical Applications of Cutting Fluids.""  Kir cher was the Bucknell Representative out of the fifteen schools represented.

Historical Tid-bits At the beginning of the century, Dr. J. H. Harris realized the need for technical courses. At that time America was just beginning the great social and industrial revolution. He helped set up the Civil Engineering Curriculum in 1902. In 1904 there arose also a need for Electrical Engineers. That's when the E. E. department was born. Lab oratories for the E. E.'s were orig inally in the basement of the East College (erected 1907). About 1900 when the power house was built, the M. E.'s came into the picture. Machinery was installed on the second floor of the power house for the M. E.'s. Students however, built and installed much of their own (Continued on page 8)"

"Demie Play, 'Lunatics At Large'",
"Proves Hilarious, If Zany, Success","""SRO""-- Standing Room Only--was the reception this year's Delta Upsilon fraternity play, ""Lunatics at Large,"" received Friday night, lightly And, with a slightly less crowded Lewisburg High School auditorium audience cheering them Saturday eve ning, James Clitter, director, and all at the D. U. House could say they had done a good job. From the time the doorman receipt ed a ticket by clobbering it with an axe, down to the final encore, the au dience was never sure what would happen. ""Lunatics at Large"" was the name of the play, but not all the ""lunatics"" were on the stage. Looking like Keystone Cops, with white uniforms, and foot-long cigars, the Demie ushers might have been a mite over zealous in their work--es corting women to their seats in stretchers; others, in wheel chairs; or, as one did, announcing the sale of cokes in the lobby by hoisting an un wary lad over his shoulders and charging up the aisles to the coke counters. No one was ever sure what would happen when one of the D, U. ushers was near. Ivy Twines At least, the night spent there was educational and instructive, what with Jim  Stanton teaching the correct way to roll your own ""cigareet."" Looking natty in a custom-built laurel wreath bequeathed to him by a Demie- quartet between acts, not even Dean Musser was safe from the off-stage lunatics. Between the intentional and other muffs, the audiences were often con fused, but the miscues never effected the total enjoyment of ""Lunatics at Large."" Those in the play proper were Bob Kerr, Stan Lippencott, Bob Cather- man, George Shepherd, John MeFad- den, Bub Bretz, Bob Dederer, Fred Wolf, Fred Hunt, Don Ray, Thayer Lyon, Dick Shaw, Foster Wilson, Marshall Goulding, and A1 Butler. George Shepherd and his deadpan Lady Macbeth monologues were high spots of the comedy1; but everyone deserved the encores they received for excellent performances. Professor Merritt also earned applause for his aid in directing the play. Delta Upsilon should have a diffi cult time next year, bettering last week's show."

Fraternities Go International With,
Decorati,"by Don Raphael There comes a tame 'every year when all school scholastic activities cease, at least as fa r as the ""scholars"" are concerned, and houseparty this year seems to be based on an inter national theme, ranging all the way from the Sig's Southern Plantation, to the D-Ubangi Ball. The DU's 'D-Ubangi Ball* will be held at the chapter 'hut', which will be transformed into a semblance of the African veldt for the formal dance Friday night from ten to two. Saturday will find the Ubangi's on a picnic, in an undisclosed location near Milton, from whence they will retire to the sanctuary of an informal open house Saturday night. Still on the ""back to nature"" theme, the KDR's will have a 'Purple Grotto' in the transformed house that will re semble a cave, with a running pool, and the usual accessories that go with a quiet mountain grotto. Dancing will take place in the grotto from nine to one on Friday evening. Hairy John's will play host to the 'nature boys and boyesses' on a picnic Saturday, with an informal open house in the evening. The Kappa Sigs will observe house- party in the traditional manner, with the 'Black and White Formal' Friday evening, and an informal dance at the chapter house Saturday night, preced ed by a picnic at Cherry Run. Up to press time, this is the only informa tion available about the Kqppa Sig's forthcoming plans. A banquet at the Milton ountry Club will start off Lambda Chi's weekend, followed by a dance at the chapter house, from nine 'till two. Their theme will be a 'New England Fishing Village', complete with a lighthouse, a dock, boats, and inside will find a Yankee fishing village. Tall Timbers will be the scene of the mariner's picnic, with the retiring seamen (and dates) returning to the house for a costume dance. The Phi Gams this year are using as their theme, 'Holiday Magazine', scenes inside the house. Going along with the appropriate international with some of the French motifs will be an elegant French Taxicab, ala Henri Ford, vintage 1924. A formal dance will be held at the house on Friday night from nine until two, followed Saturday afternoon with a picnic at Tall Timbers, and an in formal dance on Saturday night.

Editor,"Higher education in the United States is doomed unless Congress accepts Anna Rosenberg's belief that the colleges are ""the lifeline"" to the physical and spiritual arsenal of the world, says Fred M. Hechinger, education editor of the New York Times,"" in his article in the May 15th issue of a popular magazine. The future of higher education in I .CC0. Admission standards will be re- Higher Learning"" and to find out a number of things that interest Buck- nellians. A 7% per cent sample was randomly selected from the under graduates. In all, 148 interviews were made. The students were fairly unanimous in agreeing that Bucknell is ""a place to obtain an education."" They were also in favor , of co-education and Bucknell's immediate size. There was less agreement in connection with the location because a great many of the female students seem to miss the city. Nevertheless, all agreed that they did not want to attend a univer sity which was located in the city. Expense Estimate High When asked to estimate the cost of one year at Bucknell, women students put their cost between fifteen hundred and two thousand dollars. The men estimated the cost between a thou sand and fifteen hundred. A rather large majority of stu dents seemed to favor the existence of fraternities and sororities. They seem to be predominantly in favor of a change in the present ""no-cut"" sys tem. The establishment of an academic honor system is favored by most of the students who feel this system would benefit Bucknell- Those who disapprove of this system feel that ""it won't work"". Business Minded Most Bucknellians do not plan to enter graduate school. Approximately half (counting engineers) plan to go into business. Almost a third plan to enter the professional world, and the remainder are planning various alternatives. Bucknell's curriculum generally satisfies the students. When asked to pick things they thought college should give them, training for a job, ability to get along with people arid deal with problems ranked high. Moral character, citizenship, and cul tural appreciation were judged the least important. College Good For Coeds When asked to describe a number of statements as ""more true than false"" or ""more false than true,"" the results show that Bucknellians be lieve a college education is just as important for girls who marry im mediately after graduation as those who enter a career. The results also showed that students feel they should (Continued on page 8) Freshmen hazing replete with tug of war, dinks, signs, and greased poles will make its appearance on the cam pus again next year. Voting on a resolution proposed by the Student- Faculty Congress committee on this subject, faculty members yesterday decided to reinstate the freshmen haz ing period. This means that .the traditional freshmen-sophomore tug of war and the greased pole climb, highlights of the annual homecoming game, will once again be enacted. Freshmen will be required to know all school songs and must sing them and give school cheers upon the request of any upperclassmen. This can be done during the period from 4:30 p..m. to 6 p. m. on weekdays and from 1 p. m. to 6 p. m. on Saturdays and at any school function. The frosh may be requested to sing and cheer in the Bison and must dance there when asked by an upperclass man to do so. Violators of the rules will appear before the Freshman Rules Commit tee composed of upperclass men and women and will appear in specified costumes at football games. The en tire freshman class will be on call for gridiron activities. Student members of the Student- Faculty Configress appeared before the faculty to present the revised hazing plan. this country is already in doubt, he says. There is a ""disturbing trend of faculty dismissals and non-reap- pointments, and there is serious dan ger that there will be a faculty short age three years from now and a gap in the succession of great teachers ten years hence."" Mr. Hechinger, education editor of the ""New York Herald Tribune,"" de clares that Congress must be made to see that without continuation of our present system of higher education, it will be ""impossible to create the strength to defend freedom and that no freedom ma remain to be defend ed."" Although there have been predic tions that there would be as much as an 80 per cent drqjwin college enroll ment next fall, indications are that the drop will be mild, not more than 10 per cent. Although the rush into the Armed orces has been slowed by Defense Secretary George Marshall's ruling that deferred college students will be able to select their branch of service at the /end of their deferment, there will be noticeable changes in the edu cational p i c t u r e . Coeducational schools will recruit as many women as possible.

I,"Bucknellian Staff and = Prof. Robert Ewing, Advisor | laxed in some instances. Mr. Hechinger says that the most telling argument in behalf of defer ment of selected college students, is the fact that Russia is threatening to overtake us in the field of technically trained manpower. The Soviet Union had 1,516 technical institutes in 1945, not counting medical, pedagogical and other specialized colleges and univer sities. Some 600,000 students were enroll ed in such schools in 1939 and the en rollment was expected to rise to 1.7 million by 1950. In comparison, Mr. Hechinger points to this country's situation in the field of engineering. ""Three years ago the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted an over supply of engineers causing a mark ed drop of engineering enrollment. A few months ago the awakening came: After a peak was reached in 1950, with 50,000 engineering gradu ates, the number declined steadily to below 35,000 this year with about 21.000 projected for 1952, about 17.000 for 1953'and 12,000 for 1954."" He says that our best hope for the future is the exploitation of our su periority in quality through education and the constant improvement of that quality."

Colonel Barnes returned to the United States last month after spend ing more than three years in the Far East. A native of Iowa, Colonel Barnes took a pre-engineering course for two years at Parsons College, Fairfield, Iowa, before enlisting in the Army in 1935. He was assigned to Fort Sheridan, 111. In 1938 he re ceived an appointment to the U. S. Military Academy at West Point, from which he was graduated in 1942. Engineer He served in various training ca pacities with engineer combat battal ions and later as commanding officer of the 220th Armored Engineer Bat talion, 20th Armored Division. The Colonel was then assigned to the Uni versity of Iowa, where he obtained a master's degree in civil engineering. In July, 1947, he was assigned to Headquarters, Eighth Army, in Ja pan. He spent a year of service in construction, repairs and utilities and a year in troop control and engineer operations. Korea Service With the outbreak of the Korean War, Colonel Barnes' orders to return to the United States were cancelled, and in September he was sent to Korea in command of the 84th Engi neer Construction Battalion, which constructed the major railway bridges that had to be rebuilt in Korea. Infantryman Before Christmas Colonel Barnes rejoined Eighth Army Headquarters in Korea. He was appointed chief of construction and design in the Engi neer Section of the Headquarters. Leaving Korea February 28, he ar rived in the States April 4. Major Delaney, whose home is in Newtonville, Mass., was educated in the schools of Weston, Mass. He was inducted into the Army in 1941 and was graduated from Infantry School in March, 1943, as a second lieutenant. From 1943 to 1946 he was with the Plans and Training Division at Camp j (Continued on page 8.1 by Master of Ceremonies Williams' song, dance, and antics routine of ""You Always Hurt the One You Love"" (with suspected recorded aid).

The measure would require all state, municipal, and school employ ees, including teachers, to take the oath that they are not members of subversive organizations. The oath would also be required from profes sors and others employed by state- owned or state-aided colleges.

There's A Bungler In The Grass,"Mr. Geiger is an obliging man. One of his chores as the university maintenance director is to follow absent-minded students about the campus with a big black tar boiler and a truckload of gravel. Then when these students start walking across a piece of grass, this good man tears it up and fills it in with a strip of shiny new black macadam."
These students have been blithely going their errant ways,
for some time now and their sowing has reaped a bountiful,har-
vest of these ubiquitous black paths that split the campus in,
every conceivable direction. These paths presumably take .every,
reasonably ambitious student any place he might want to go.,"W e said presumably for now, it seems, senior path does not traverse enough of the campus to take the boys from the men s quad down to Davis Gym. Some astute bungler, noticing this, launched the whole thing by tripping his way across the large ex panse of green that lies between. And fast on his heels, sheep like, came the whole male population, hell-bent for phys. ed."
"The weary Mr. Geiger, not to be caught with his tar cold,",
"began firing up the huge pots and, if the strip of brown crossing",
"this field gets any bigger, we are going to wake up early some",
"afternoon and find another nice, bright, shiny, black path there",
instead.,

Here are excerpts from all t ree o em. Here are some cheating methods which the Hurricane listed as common among students : . * , , The ""bloody nose"" excuse, where student taking a test complains he nas a bloody nose, asks to be excused from class for a moment. Once ou si 6 room, student meets friends who help him with answers. The lavatory is another convenient place to rendezvous. The Hurricane reports that ""during one of the 10-minute recesses between classes last semes ter, one meh^s rest room was crowded to capacity with students o two psy chology classes comparing notes on a test."" Placing a page of cheating notes between test questions and answer sheet. Notes are the same size as exam paper. "" Even the space between chairs,"" says the Hurricane, ""sometimes doesn't prevent cheating. Two students were seen comparing test papere during a history quiz even though their chairs were nearly four feet apart. Other cheating methods include: leaving blank spaces on answer papers to be filled in later during self-grading; placing open notebooks on the floor during a test; changing answers during self-grading; whispering answers, a simply glancing at someone's paper. In a beginning reporters class, reports the Daily Texan, University of Texas, a teacher was conducting a drill on the style book. One examp e was, "" Blank received a bachelor of journalism degree in 1948."""
^,"To get in on the conversation, one student asked, ""Do we give a bachelor of journalism degree here?"" . , The teacher snapped back, ""Well, that's what you're working for, isnt ' "" I dunno,"" replied the student, "" I'm just working to stay out of the army."" The Drexel Triangle, Drexel Institute of Technology, advises students not to drop cigarette butts on the court steps.

The book is: called "" Going Places"" and is a guide to 20 Eastern women's colleges; There is a map of each campus, important telephone num bers, details about curfew, as well as a critique of nearby restaurants and nightclubs. George P. Craighead, '52, of De troit, Mich., is editor of the Yale board that prepared the handbook which they now plan to sell for one dollar to college men throughout the East. The book has been published by the Yale Banner, an undergraduate organization that publishes the an nual Yale yearbook and other cam pus directories. From The Horse's Mouth "" Information about each women's college comes directly from the col lege officials,"" Editor Craighead ex plained, but added that his board did not stop there. About 40 college girls from the 20 colleges supplied ""inside"" facts about their own campus to aid visiting men. In addition, the Yale students have drawn on their own weekend experiences to add to the in telligence. The handbook, Editor Craighead emphasized, contains comments on women's colleges not usually found in the regular catalogues. Under Skidmore College, for in stance, the Yale editors have written in part: "" Saratoga's crowd of the past generation, replete with gamb lers, sportsmen, and cosmopolites would never have dreamed that their favorite resort would be graced by a woman's college . . .  A promenade around the Yaddo provides the per fect occasion to murmur words of af fection and give her that fraternity pin."" Beware The Watchman Then there axe bits of warning, such as found under Smith College: "" Any shy young lads should not plan to arrive at either 1 or 6 p. m. since at those times the entire house is enter the dining room. At almost any hour, however, be prepared for the assortment of girls who will eye you from their perpetual bridge games on the floor."" downstairs waiting for a signal to ""Vassar weekends almost invari ably include picnics, so be sure to # bring old clothes with you,"" the book advises, and also gives this informa tion about Sarah Lawrence College: "" Invariably, you'll be screened by Ernest, the omnipresent night watch man. His is the job of seeing that the dormitory living rooms are va cated by 12:30 on weekdays and 1:39 on Saturdays."" About Radcliffe, the Yale editors have this reassuring bit: "" Although Radcliffe College has been known in the environs of Boston as the Har vard Annex, you can still tell a Rad cliffe girl from a Harvard man, even a mile away."" Of the 20 colleges, outlined in "" Go ing Places,"" 19 are real schools, the twentieth is mythological. The edi tors have created a non-existent wo man's college located on a non-exist ent hill in New Hampshire. Life there is easy and the regulations lax, and the editors are hoping that the 19 other colleges may follow suit."

Vera Dean Tells Of Soviet-U.S.,
Conflict In Lecture Series Talk,"The fundamental differences between the Soviet Union and the United States were pointed out and explained Sunday evening in the Lit. Auditorium by Mrs. Vera M. Dean, eminent authority on relations between the two coun tries. Mrs. Dean was born in Russia biftPSj later came to the U. S. and as a re- sult has a background of both coun tries. Since 1938 Mrs. Dean has served in several government posts and is also an author, and world-wide lecturer. Balance Destroyed Up until the second World War, Mrs. Dean stated, the dealings be tween the U. S. and Russia were of no great importance. However, the balance of power among nations was destroyed by World War II and two super-powers emerged, the U. S. and Russia. As a result a new balance of power must be formed to establish world stability and the framework of this balance of power must be the U. N. and not a ""war minded coalition."" However, in order to form a good peaceful organization with Russia we must know and understand Russia and how she compares to the United States both materially and non-ma- terially. Industrial Production In comparing the two nations ma terially Mrs. Dean first dealt with their industrial production. The U. S. manufactures 100 million tons of industrial goods a year, %she said, while the Soviet Union only produces 25 million tons a year, and this is why Russia wants the Ruhr. More over, the"
U.,"S. and Great Britain con trol 90% of the world's oil, which of course is why Russia desires to gain control of Iran. However, to offset the United States, Russia has been re-arming with nearly all her indus- (Continued on page 8)"

Bullets Fall Short As Roush Hurls Mates To 6-3 Victory,
Second Inning Outburst Ices Game,
As Hurler Clamps On Late Rally;,
Kough Blasts Triple To Cap Win,"by Bill LeMon A four run attack in the second inning provided the punch to give the Bison baseball squad its sixth win o f the season yesterday as pitcher Dick Roush pitched his mates to a 6-3 victory over the visiting Gettysburg Bullets. Collect Seven Hits deg ---------------------------------- -- - -------------- ~ The Bucknell squad made six runs out of seven hits while the visitors collected six hits off the offerings of Roush for a total of ""three runs. Abe Powellson started the carnage in the second inning as he got to first safely after sending a ball labeled ""too hot to handle"" through the G- Burg infield. After stealing second he raced to third on Jim DiGuiseppi's infield out. Marty McKibbin's single sent Powellson across the plate with the first run. Brad Myers drove out another single putting McKibbin at third from where he scored on a wild pitch. Kough Triples The longest hit of the game came next as Cal Kough, muscular third sacker, blasted a triple. Myers tal lied and Kough followed him seconds later on another wild pitch. An earlier run by the visitors gave the Bisons a 4-1 lead at the end of the second frame. Ron Fitzkee, center fielder for the Bullets opened the fourth inning with a hard grounder to the infield. He stopped at second when Jackie Web ber's peg sailed past the outstretched glove of first sacker Marty McKibbin. He scored on a single by Keller who promtly dented the plate after a long fly ball. Shirk Impressive Two insurance runs came in the eighth inning when DiGuiseppi scored on Myers single and McKibbin tallied on a wild pitch. In the Bullet half of the same inning Bitner scored on a triple by Hare. With only one out, Bucknell's Andy Shirk made a tre mendous throw from deep center field following a catch of Fitzkee's drive to nail Hare at the pl^ite. Hare was out at the plate stifling all hope for Bullet Coach Ira Planks' nine. Roush pitched brilliantly for the Lanemen as he sent eleven Bullet batsmen back to the bench via the strikeout route. Sacco fanned six for the losers. Gettysburg ..... 100 100 010--3 6 1 Bucknell ......... 040 000 02x-- 6 7 2"

Jackie Webber, Bison shortstop, made 7 putouts and had 20 assists against no errors in the first seven games of the 1951 season. by Bruce L. Swanger Bill Lane's diamondmen suffered their third straight loss Saturday on Memorial Field when Ithaca College slugged out an impressive 17-3 win. Ithacans Tough The Ithacans, with wins over strong Army, Penn State and Sampson teams, showed little respect for the usually effective Bucknell pitching, as they sprayed the outfield with 21 hits, including three doubles, three triples and a home run. Lucas started on the mound for Bucknell. He was tagged for eight runs and seven hits in two and two- thirds innings. The big blow off the southpaw was pitcher McCarty's towering home run. The ball landed on the roof of a car parked on the driveway at Memorial gate. Sinclair Robs Gilberti Roush came on to pitch the next four innings, allowing eight runs on ten hits, before being relieved by Von Heil with one away in the seventh. Dick was saved more grief in the sixth, when he filled the bases on a single and two walks, and Mai Sin- j clair made a sensational, running, third out catch of Gilberti's bid for a home run. Von Heil finished, allowing the final run in the eighth. Bucknell could do little against the low breaking deliveries of McCarthy until the fifth inning. In this frame the Bisons hit the scoring column for the first time, when Jackie Webber poled a long triple to right center field. Webber held third as DiGui seppi beat out an infield hit to the pitcher, but rode home on a ground single over second by Roush. Franke Triples The second Bison run was posted # j in the sixth. Franke tripled over the : | center fielder's head, and came home j ! wken DeCola fumbled the relay from ;! the outfield. | j Powelson added the third run in the ; i eighth.

FOR ARROW UNIVERSITY STYLES,"1 U by Ell wood Rowe Reeling under the impact of three straight defeats, the Bison nine tra veled to Selinsgrove Monday and broke their losing skein by overpower ing Susquehanna 13-6. For the host Crusaders it was defeat number six in as many outings; for the trium phant Herd, it was win number four. Von Heil Starts Coach Bill Lane nominated1 Lenny Von Heill for mound duty. He was touched for three hits and three runs in the three innings which he toiled. Lanky Dave Lucas who throws them from the port side, made his appear ance in the fourth and chalked lup his third win as he held 'the Crusaders to six hits and only three runs over the final six fraces. The Orange and Blue tossers first big inning came midway in the fruit ful fourth as they picked up three markers. After Jim DiGiiiseppi and Jackie Weber had both singled sharp ly to start the inning, Cal # Kough strolled to fill the bases.

Coaches Are Impressed,"by Dick Shaw Last Saturday's scrimmage with Penn State brought the six week ses sion of spring practice, being con ducted by Coach Harry Lawrence to a close. Lions Win? The practice game with the Nittany Lions ran for six quarters, the final score in touchdowns reading, State 7 and Bucknell 4. However, one factor in favor of Penn State was the fact that the Blue and White squad far outnumbered the Bisons. The coaching staff was well satis fied with the spring workout. Al though a small squad reported it was advantageous in that more individual work could be done. Approximately 42 men will compose the 1951 team. This will be one of the smallest squads in recent history hut Lawrence points out that the quality of the players will offset the lack of quantity. Freshmen who will report for var sity duty next season are: Owne Mur- nane, Bob Dee, Alton Stowell, Ken Adamec, Dusty Rhodes, Jim Ko'slow- ski, backs; Mike Jensen and Nick 01- kivich, ends; Jim Egloff, Bill Keener, Bill Grey, Paul Ganz, Bill LeMon, Hal Haddock, John hirona, linemen.

Georgetown Dropped The game will fill an open date on the Bison schedule which developed in March when Georgetown University annoupced that it would drop inter collegiate football. The Georgetown game was slated to have been- played on October 13 in Washington, D. C. The encounter with Kent State wil] mark the first Bison invasion of Ohio for a football game since the 21 to 6 victory over Case at Cleveland in 1942. According to last year's statistics the Golden Flashes should prove a formidable opponent. The Ohioans were 20th in the nations small col leges in total offense and 11th in rushing offense. Bucknell was 28th in total offense and 18th in rushing offense. Defensively the Bisons had the statistical edge.

Wins by co-captain Bill Allen, Van Johnson and Allan Judkins accounted for the victory. In the first foursome Allen out- stroked Bruce Castor 7-6, and John son carded a 5-4 win over Jack Loesel. The Bucknell twosome won best ball 4-3. Co-captain Russ Long and Ben Hoffman dropped 2-1 and 3-2 matches to the Leopard's A1 Wardel and Roger Murray respectively. The home pair was two down for best ball in this second quartette. In the last group Lafayette's John Loufinney was one up on Ted Stark, but Allan Judkins came through to defeat Danco 4-3, thereby giving the best ball, 4-3, and the clinching point to coach Harold Evan's charges."

Bison Netmen Trounce,
Visiting Panthers 6-3,"by Jack Gamble The Panthers of Pittsburgh Univer sity had their claws dulled somewhat when they moved on the University Courts and dropped a 6-3 decision to the Bison netmen last Friday. Hank Peters racqueteers captured all but two matches in the singles and dropped only one match, conceding, in doubles. The two singles matches fell when Capt. Gray Rogers lost to Harry Campaney 6-4, 6-3 and Nick Schloeder fell by the wayside to Bob Ilisevich 6-4, 6-1. In other singles matches it was the Bison all the way as Bill Reitz had to fight for a 9-7 first game and then returned to takd the match 6-4 in the second set. A1 Goff downed Joe Bendel 6-1, 6-3 after dropping the first set 2-6. Jim Hess was the other Bison victor as he gar nered 6-1 and 6-2 wins over Harry Duncan. Remmey Downs Champ The Panther's number one man, John Lohesetter, won the Western Pennsylvania Championship in open competition last year and reached the quarter-finals of the Eastern Collegi ate matches at Syracuse but found the going tough when he met the Herd"" s number one man, Paul Rem mey. The match was one of those back and forth affairs but when the lights dimmed Remmey emerged the victor by scores of 9-7 and 7-5. Hess and Mufson teamed to down the first of the Pitt double contenders, Duncan and Litchman, 6-1, 6-3. Rem mey and Reitz found the going a bit easier as they took their match from the Panthers Roof and Bendel 6-2, 6-0. In the final doubles matches it was Rogers and Schloeder versus Loheset ter and Campaney when the lucky old sun forced the Bison to concede with the scores at 6-1 and 6-6. When the final tally was added the Bisons found themselves on top with the final: BU 6, PITT 3."
Maryland Netmen Make,
Appearance Tomorrow,"The strong University of Maryland netmen will make their initial appear ance on the University courts tomor row afternoon at 3:30 when they give the Bisons a chance to avenge an earlier 7-2 defeat. The Old Liners made things tough for the Herd more than a month ago at College Park and Hank Peter's charges, improving every match, will be out to gain revenge. The match was just recently added to the 1951 schedule."

"THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.","THURSDAY, MAY 3, 1951."
Engine-Ears,"by Ed Prokoff Mr. Francis Friel, who represented the ASCE and the U. S. government at the World Trade Exhibition in India, was the guest of the Civil En gineers last Thursday. He is also director of the Philadelphia-Lehigh ASCE district. At the recent meeting Mr. Friel re capitulated upon the three main topics that were of interest to the interna tional delegates. These were: ""World Conference on Large Dams,"" ""World Power,"" and ""The International As sociation for Hydraulic Research."" Forty nations were represented. Trading of ideas, illustration of new techniques, and the delivery o f technical papers all aided in fostering scientific progress and goodwill. A c tually, the direct aim of the meeting, since it was sponsored by India, was to lay the groundwork for the Indus trial development of the Indian na tion. Yesterday, an Inspection trip was made to the Conamaugh Dam at Johnston, Pa. This dam was built for flood control and delivery o f power in the Pittsburgh area. The day before the trip, Mr. Anderson, from Conamaugh, delivered a short talk outlining the features of the dam. Another senior student who has brought honor to the Chemical Engi neering Department is Donald Par sons. At the recent AIChE Conven tion, Don tied for first place with his technical paper, ""The Use of Pipe El bows as Flow Meters."" Two more projects that will be ex plained and demonstrated by the graduates at the coming open house are: "" Liquid Liquid Extraction,"" and "" Determination of Heat Transfer Co efficients of Condensing Vapors"" . These sound interesting and intricate; should be of interest to many. Like an old soldier the E. E.'s are fading off with their last meeting which will be held May 9. This also applies to the remaining departments. However, dates have not been set by them yet. Historical Tidbits Bucknell has its share of famous men, as do other colleges. One of the world's outstanding pipe line en gineers was Oscar W olfe ('12). Su pervision of the ""Big Inch"" pipe line installation was undertaken by him. A noted glass chemist was Dr. John Hostetter. The 200-inch lens for the observatory in California was cast under his direction. Another dis tinguished graduate was Mr. John Walls. The Safe Harbor and the Holtwood Dams on the lower Susque hanna were built by him. One time chemical director of the Du Pont Chemical Co. was Dr. Elmer K. Bol ton. A governor of Pennsylvania who later became a member of the Univer sity faculty was the Honorable James Pollock. It is interesting to learn that it was he, when he was Director of the United States Mint, who placed the motto: "" In God We Trust"" on our coins."
A Show! You're Mad Gal!,"I've been reading in the Sunday editions of a local paper, how a student here at the Univesity has been dating a coed on ""from two to five dollars a week."" What a spendthrift! In my wildest day when I had a job and threw money away on trifles, (girls), T never spent more than 75c in one mad, pro digious evening! To illustrate my point, here is a detailed account o f my last date, Sat urday, March 10. I left the house at four-thirty in the afternoon so that I would arrive promptly at seven, the appointed hour. You see I was walking and it's ten miles to her home. Due to a "" charley horse"" which de veloped on the way, I didn't get there until eight. Yu might think she was angry. Not my girl! She even laughed as she slammed the door on my hand. Luckily, her father is a plumber and he managed to twist my fingers back into shape with an end- wrench. After she turned down my sugges tion to watch television, we finally agreed on going to some downtown theatre. Her i father's new car han dled beautifully as we wheeled our way toward the bright lights. We attended one of those little shows off Michigan avenue that just reek with local color and odd charac ters. The pictures were "" The Sheik,"" starring Rudolph Valentino a n d "" Little Miss Marker,"" with Shirley"

But the hilarious part of it was' that we had left it in a no parking zone and there was a two-dollar ticket on the windshield. Of. course her father will get it because it's his car. She agreed to go straight home without stopping for a snack after I explained how eating before bedtime is very damaging to the digestive system. My leg had cleared up during the evening and the walk home didn't take nearly as long. Just as I put my key in the lock, the sky began to get bright. There it is fellows, how to date on less than a dollar a week. But al ways remember to send a little note of thanks by mail. However, a strange thing happened today.

This is the organiza tion's 50th year of operation on the Bucknell campus,, and the celebration is being topped off by the May Day presentation, "" Leocadia,"" which is having its debut on Friday and Satur day nights, May 11 and 12. Translated from French by Dr. Douglas Orrok and students Miriam Ennis and Mary Anne Ziegler, the four-act comedy will receive its first presentation in English at Lewisburg High School on those dates. Started In '01 The past 50 years have witnessed much in the line of change for Cap & Dagger, which officially came into ex istence in 1901 when it was organized solely for men interested in the theatre. Not until 1931, at which time it merged with "" Frill & Frown,"" the woman's dramatic club, did it re semble its present form. As far back as 1899 there were spasmodic efforts in the form of stu dent dramatic clubs, however. In the L'Agenda of 1900, the Bucknell Dra matic Club proudly prsented two little epics entitled, ""Trouble in Burleigh's Room"" and ""A Courtship Under Dif ficulties."" 25 Years Of Service At the same time as C & D's anni versary on campus, there is another important one, and that is Dr. C.

Campus Quizzer,"by Elaine Vouyoukas "" What Do You Think The Well Dressed Man About Campus Should W ear?"" Now that spring is here, all the women on campus are muttering about their spring clothes, so we thought it mght be wise to say a few words on the male's side of the story. Being a bright and observant( ?) re porter (ahem), we selected a fair cross section of the male population of the campus. The first on our panel of fashion experts was an engineer. We shall call him ""Joe College"" for courtesy's, sake. He was very shy and bashful, so this is what he said: "" Wel-1-1, clothes."" (Intelligent, hey what?). We questioned him further. "" Dungarees, I wear mostly ....... you know, we engineers -have to work awful hard, lab and all that"" How true. As a matter of fact, we don't see much of the engineers, do w e? (Except for an occasional glimpse of them in the library pour ing over Organic Chemistry 346). We thought maybe the girls could enlighten me further on this fascin ating subject, so we queried Miss Janie Brown. She replied cheerily: "" Greasepaint, a costume, false whiskers and he should be going to rehearsals!"" A true Cap and Dagger Fan. Well, all the men can't all wear this par ticular costume, but while Mile. Mo diste was in production, we had our doubts as to whether anybody was wearing anything else! Joy Mackwell, a cute little co-ed "" in the know,"" says: "" Slacks, a sport jacket, or a shirt. I like my man to be a Dapper Dan!"" Well beat me flat if that ain't snap! A real cool outfit. We could do with more of that and less with some of the attire Betty Paul has evidently seen. Betty, a well-dressed Alpha Phi, says: "" He should be neat looking, he shouldn't took as though he has a date to go horseback riding a half an hour after class. Neither should he look like a character out of Greenwich Village. Other than that I have no preferences."" Nuff said! Ouch ....... Did that hit ""certain characters"" below the belt? Alan Goff, a Phi Psi, sums it up nicely and to a T, when he divulges this bit of information. ""Grey flan nels, white button down 'oxfords, a regulation striped tie and white bucks. For this season, cotton cord jackets and hand knit socks."" Most of the men on the campus do follow this advice and it seems to suit the girls. But there's one thing I'm worried about ....... Who's going to knit the socks ? ? ? ? ?"

Behind,
The Mike,"by Jim Hastings Many Bucknellians have quizzed me j concerning the wooden structure be ing built behind the radio station! Some say that WVBU is expanding into Chet's, while others say that Chet's is pushing WVBU right out into the street. What can be the answer? Actually this is what's happening. It seems that the' Bison is suffering from growing pains .and had but one direction to go! It seems also that the familiar blue and white mansion was almost in the way. But because of careful measurements by the sur veyors, your station will be sacrificed from the wrecker's hammers by two and one-half inches. Yes, that's about all the space there will be be tween the station and the new addi tion to Chet' s. This discussion brings back a situ ation that occurred several years ago between these two old BU institu tions. As the story goes, WVBU pleaded innocent to charges by Chets that the former was guilty o f dis turbing the peace in the latter's' es tablishment. How complicated can one sentence get! The case was dis missed on grounds of insufficient noise! After Jerry Olds arrived at Ann apolis last Wednesday to broadcast the Navy-BU game, he overheard a conversation by the telephone work men on the lines that WVBU had rented for broadcasting purposes. The conversation went something like this! "" Say Joe, I wonder what two-bit station up North is renting this line. It's costing the company more money to run the wires from the outlet onto the field than they'll make from the rental service. What is this, government interference in free enterprise or somethin' ?"" Predictions for"

Long Suffering Bridge Player,
Attempts Escape From The Fiends,"by Elaine Vouyoukas "" Fourth for bri-idge!"" That omnious cry echoed down the dim, empty dormitory. Miraculously and simultaneously a head appears from every door. ""Of course!"" , we shout in unison and the vicious circle begins. Bridge, bridge, bridge-- after dinner, before dinner, in between classes, face it girls, we're in a rut! But oh, how I love that rut! This game has a strange fascination for me. However in my various and sundry P"" ---------------------------------------- -- days of bridge-playing, I have ob served distinctly different types of bridge-players. I would like to define and describe a few of these characters so that you may be wary of them in your next round of that intriguing game of bridge. Beginner's Luck Beware of the girl who says, "" I never played before in my life. You'll have to help me. Now, are clubs higher than spades? When I say pass, do my partner and I get the bid? She's the girl who invariably makes a grand slam. For those of the less bridge-educated readers, that's every trick in the deck. Or how about the dead serious player? In my child-like innocence, I forget to count the trump. Imme diately a blood-curdling cry of an guish arises from my partner. After she has simmered down to a subdued garble of unprintable words, I man age to squeak out the defenseless plea, "" It's only a game!"" This feeble excuse, nevertheless, does not calm her inexplicable rage. Two hours later, she is still relentlessly rehash ing every trick, finesse, bid, in the entire game. Secret Type Then there's always the poker- faced player. She has four aces, four kings, four queens and a jack of spades. But does she let you, her partner, know it? No-o-o-o. She hesitates, sighs and says, "" I just don't know what to do ....... "" So she passes. In such a case you take a chance, if you feel especially daring, and bid. If you DON'T bid, you quietly and unobtrusively knock your head against the wall, or hers, when the game is over and she tells you what she had in her pink little palm. And we musn't forget the girl who seems to have been born with a deck of cards in her hands. To escape from the sound of shuffling cards, 1 sojourned to Chet's to calm my bridge- weary nerves over a cup of coffee. I've been there with this seemingly harmless individual for five minutes -- out come the cards. I'm trapped, As I look frantically around the room for aid, two girls bear down upon us with that bridge-hungry look in their eyes. It's hopeless. While she is dealing them expertly into four small piles, the dawning light filters slowly through my weary brain-- I'm fated to spend the rest of my unnatural days playing bridge. Means Of Escape Of course there ARE ways of pro tecting yourself from the bite of the bridge bug. One of them is to lock yourself in your room and bury you nose in a book. I think I'll try that right now just to show you it CAN work. Wait, what's that I hear? Methinks it's a faint sound of cards being shuffled with a tantalizing click. A nasty little, deceptively sweet voice whispers,"" Bridge, Elaine ......... As I walk down to the den of bridge fiends in a hypnotic daze, I realize the fatal fact. You just CAN'T escape!!"
Food Comes In By Truckload,
To Feed Hungry Sem-Gems,"by Joan Hackney A little after 6 p. m. in the Women's Dining Hall, 500 people are enjoying 500 identical meals. Down to the last, loving detail, every dinner is exactly the same. This mysterious production of meals which seem'too tenderly pre pared to have come off a production line, has always intrigued me. The inner workings of the dining I found, are even more compli- Hey, Hank! It's HOUSEPARTY! Hell week's all over, Boy. Hank!"

Ode To The Pin,"Oh sacred pin of golden hue, We strive and scheme and worship you, We dream of you both night and day, And hope to snatch you the fourth of May. Oh to have a crescent and a star Pinned by one who owns a car! Or the shield with pearls adorned Would not by us be ever scorned. Oh shining white cross proudly gleaming, For want of thee we wake up scream ing; Or two swords crossed above my heart Meaning that we shall never part.

I,"fPSPSA - ?y fcA /.S - For the benefit of this column't phew phaithful phollowers, perhaps a word of explanation is due as to why there was no column last week. The Cat went to the editor of this sheet and demanded (1) front-page placing and (2) a raise. We got a.raise, too For a little guy, that McAvoy has a pretty strong foot. And unfortu nately the Cat is no dead-end kid. So last weekend the Cat went home to his beloved Jersey. The first thing we did was to go to see one of those famous revues at the Hudson Theatre in Union City. This place boasts of a very fine pit band. They hold the world's record for playing the nation al anthem--23 seconds. And ROSE LA ROSE provided quite an aesthetic experience. The followng night the Cat jour neyed up to the Rustic Cabin in Englewood Cliffs to dig BUDDY De- FRANCO, billed as the' world's No. 1 clarinetist. Both he and his band were very fine. But if you should ever decide to hit this barn-like bis tro, be sure that you are equipped with a pocketful of dimes-- especially if you plan to drink beah all night. The Cat also caught FRANK SIN ATRA'S TV show. DAGMAR was his guest. The Voice's personality and appeal have never been at such a peak. He was great. And DAG MAR, of cuz, is pointed toward fame'. And there are a few new records out worthy of menton --  CHARLIE BARNET's Svaxng of SPAIN, for in stance. The Mab makes sense here with his strings. His alto and the scoring of Johnny Richards for piano and strings make this one really shine ....... WOODY HERMAN'S cut ting of LONESOME GAL uses the three-tenor-and-baritone sound, first behind WOODY's alto and then be hind DOLLY HOUSTON'S pleasant but rather beatless voice ....... Finally, RAY NOBLE's sly- sense of humor is ' shown in SHEIK OF ARABY, as we hear Street calls of shish kebab, ge- fulte fish, coca-cola, hot popcorn, and fish and chips. u n m u m iu m u m iiii"

Feed ing the Sem Gems is a full-time job equring the services of 20 regular employees,- a secretary, a menu-plan ner, and the constant attention of Mrs. Long, the manager and buyer. Mrs. Long, an austere but kindly gray-haired woman, holds a Masters degree in psychology from Bucknell. Food By The Truckload Almost every day, salesmen from varous wholesale companies visit her office"
to,"get orders for food. Mrs. Long gets samples of each type of food from eight or ten firms before deciding on the one to buy from. Everything is bought whole sale; some things are bought in whole truckload lots. While there are no set rules as to which companies shall supply certain foods year in and year out, the meat is always obtained from Swift and Company. The menus are planned 10 days in advance, partly by Mrs. Long and partly by Mrs, Groezinger, of the meh's dinng hall, who works about two hours every week on the menus. Sanitary Conditions Maintained An elaborate system for maintain ing sanitary conditions in the food and utensils is carried on continuous ly. Besides the students who operate the dishwashers, two men are employ ed to keep the . temperature of the water and the amount of detergent just right. The silverware is soaked and sterilized even before it goes into the dishwasher. Samples of the bacteria content of the plates, glasses, and cups are taken once a week as they come out of the dishwasher to make sure that no germs are left on them. Milk, ice cream, and water are tested once a week by the school health officer for purity. The kitchen is supervised by the chef, who takes care of the meat and soup preparation. Two women con centrate on bakng, while three others, in the serving room, are in charge of the "" fixings"" : coffee, tea, salad dress ing, and other last minute touches. Five women cook the vegetables and make salads. Serving the meal is entrusted to about seventy students, who act as waiters and waitresses. Ingredients Measured By Weight As everything is prepared on a grand scale, ingredients are measur ed, not by cups or teaspoons, but by weight. The extra food produced-- and there is always some which isn't needed-- is offered to the students who work in the dining hall in addi tion to their regular meal, which they eat just before the dining room opens. Most Absentees Friday Night Over the weekend, Mrs. Long in formed me, about 100 girls are miss ing from each meal, the lowest at tendance being on Friday night and the next lowest on Saturday night. No matter what day it is, only about half the girls go to breakfast. 4EW YORK Three-Year Dan Course Four-Year Evening Course CO-EDUCATIONAL Member Assn, of American Law Schools Matriculants must be College grad uates and present full transcript of College record CLASSES BEGIN SEPT. 24, 1951 H elp  K eep B ucknell Green U se T h e  P aths!

Secondly, Mrs. Dean compared the armament of the two super-powers. Russia with China has many men to throw into battle but many of these men are not skilled. Then too, Mrs. Dean stated that the military experts have over-estimated and exaggerated the amount, of Russian manpower. As for our side of the manpower sit uation, we can always bring in the Chinese nationalists who, with our own and our allies' troops form an army of no small size. Different Basises As for the non-material differences between the two nations, it is evi dent that they are formed on totally different basises. Our belief in hu man freedom and our pratising this belief is the basis of our nation. On the contrary, Russia does not propose human freedom, at least not in the Western meaning of the word. Their different customs and lower standard of living prohibits their accepting our form of government. A people, down trodden as the Russians have been throughout their long history, cannot be expected to grasp and to want the principles which the United States is based on. As for relations between the two countries, Mrs. Dean feels that Russia wants an isolated U. S. (Continued from page 1.)

With 173 Pints Given To Cause,"Notice the little red buttons on These patriotic students parted with a pint of their blood in Hunt Rec room on Tuesday, May 8 , for the Red Cross Blood Donor Drive. The bloodmobile, which was from Wilkes-Barre, the North Eastern Pennsylvania Blood Center, was here from two until eight o'clock. Dr. Joseph Weightman of the Bucknell Infirmary was on duty the entire time. Out of the 201 registered per sons, 17 were rejected while 38 stu dents vyere ""walk-ins""-not registered. There were seven registered nurses, two technicians and nine nurses' aides serving from the Union County Chap ter. The donors were cared for on the lapels of 173 loyal Bucknellians? o ______ _ _________________________ 14 beds. Students crowded the hall late in the afternoon, and in spite of the al most hour-long wait, the donors were in fine shape as the needle was in serted into their veins. After the blood was taken from the students, they were served refresh ments in the form of cookies, crack ers, coffee and pineapple juice by stu dent volunteers. At eight o'clock the I blood was picked up by the Red Cross j representative, and taken to a nearby processing center. The staff of the Blood Donation Center then moved off to their nex for the Bucknell organize tibn, the others being ""Ah, Wilderness"" and ""Our Town."" In addition, C"

The puzzle concerning the mysteri ous Assistant Dean of Men has finally been solved. The reason the Buck nell campus is not acquainted with this elusive gentleman is that he does not exist. Mr. D. Paul Souders, professor of mathematics, has been rumored as this man in hiding. Although Mr. Souders is not Assistant Dean of Men, he is Director of the Men's Counselors. In the past Dean Musser has been responsible for the 14 men counselors. However, because Mr. Musser has ad ditional duties with the coming of the R. O. T. _C., Mr. Souders has been ask ed to be advisor of the counseling of male students. As Director of Men's Counselors, Mr. Souders, with the assistance of Dean Musser and Mr. Howard Kieft, selects the counselors. He also meets weekly with these students .to discuss their duties and problems. Mr. Souders received his master's degree in mathematics at the Univer sity of Wisconsin."

THE BUCKNELLIAN,"THURSDAY, MAY 10, 1951."
Thus Spake Zarathustra,"In lieu of the swan song usually written as an editor's last editorial, a few lines about the B U C K N E L L IA N  seems more in order this week-- especially in view of a recent attack against publications of our kind by the editor of another college paper, the Bona Venture of St. Bonaventure University."
The,Bona Venture
"it should be explained, is unlike our own",
Student Voice in that it is subject to a direct and thorough cen,
sorship by the authorities of that school.,
The,
B U C K N E L L,
"IA N ,",
"as every student should know by now, is wholly",free from
administration or faculty intervention.,
Although our stands on,
various issues have been directly contrary to those of the admin,
"istration, we have never been reprimanded in any way.",
The as,
"sumption being, of course, that it is a student paper, financed for",
the most part by appropriations from student activity fees.,
Our,
"faculty advisor, Professor Ewing, is just what his title implies.",
Although a constant light of inspiration he has never thought of,
"dictating policy, a stand that isn't too easy to take in the face of",
occasional faculty pressure.,"An arrangement of this sort, says the Bona Venture, has re sulted in "" American secular student publications (that's us) be ing reduced to carriers of moral filth, advocates of journalistic irresponsibility and exponents of a misguided and abused defini tion of the honest principle o f 'Freedom  of the Press'."" T he editor expands on this to say that college papers of the Bona V en ture's class "" are in general the only institutions of higher learn ing in America today that will teach the student not only what the tools of writing are, but also how  they are to be used, and w hy they are to be used."" This would seem to be a pretty strong statement to leave unqualified for a paper that "" knows how  to use the tools of writing."" The writer goes on to say that the Bona Venture "" gladly accepts all just censorship."""
"With the benefit of the all-wise guiding hands of their ""ad",
"visors"" and their many years of experience, one would assume",
that the Bona Venture would be a truly superb college news,
paper.,
Unfortunately this is not the case for even a cursory ex,
amination of that paper reveals such elementary mistakes as the,
"placement of the masthead over the editorials (if there are any),",
"poor organization of advertising, and failure to keep expressions",
of opinion out of news stories.,
Although the paper is a mem,
"ber of the Associated Collegiate Press, we fail to find any printed",
indication of its national rating.,"No, if the B U C K N E L L IA N  is an "" instrument of misguided responsibility"" or a carrier of "" moral filth"" (which is absurd) we still prefer our method of learning by meeting and settling our ow n problems rather than by accepting dogm atic principles dic tated by non-students."
"However, it is nice that St. Bonaventure lets students work",
on its paper.,
W e hope these people will always have someone,
to make their decisions for them when they get out in the cruel,
newspaper world.,

NO PREMIUMS ON QUEENS . . .,"The Kansas State Collegian is a little jaded by all the queens on campus. It declares: "" Ever stop to count them? Don't. It takes too long. . . Since queens are so commonplace these days, a coed feels accom plished if she manages to get thruogh school without the hdeg"" deg r; The fifty per cent who aren't elected a queen or attendant are flattered to think they ve- kept their individuality! . . . It would be better to lean more to quality instead, of quantity and thus keep our queens from getting lost in the shuffle. * * * * *"
A DULL DOCILE BUNCH . . .,"The modem college student is alarmingly passive and ready to conform,, according to Oscar Handlin, associate professor of history, Harvard Umv.. In an article in Atlantic Monthly Handlir. remarked, ""This generation wel comed the shackles of orthodoxy--all those eager faces looking up at the plat form, waiting to be told what to believe. There was delight in dogma; know the authorities, accept the classics, and wash your problems away.. "" When I hurled these charges at groups of them, they sat hack compla cently. What I intended as epithets, they took as compliments. Released,, they would tell me they were so well adjusted because they were Bet- ter brought up. 'V . . . If Emerson's America was the country of young men because it believed in progress and had faith in itself, has our America ceased'to be the country of young men because it has lost confidence and no longer believes in itself?"" * * * * *"
PUT DOWN YOUR COMIC BOOKS AND QUIT GRIPING,"------ A recent vital student election on the adoption of a revamped constitution at the University of Oklahoma brough out exactly 63 votes. Student enroll ment at this university is 8500. Following the election, a student declared in a letter to the Oklahoma Daily that, ""From here on out there isn't a student here on this campus who has any gripe when it comes to the question of representation and politics within their chosen governing body. ""It is an outright insult to the spirit and intelligence of this supposedly class 'A' university when a meager 63 kids . . . turn out to vote on an issue that not only effects the majority of students on campus, but also for a meas ure that was fought over for many months by these same intellects. ' The angry student appealed to the Oklahoma student body to, Sacrifice your comic books, saddle shoes and high school childishness, which have'no place in a university of this stature."" * * * * * NO WAY TO GET RICH? . . . A recerit survey conducted by the U. S. Department of Labor indicates most college teachers are getting second rate salaries. Scientists, for ex ample, get the most pay when working for an industry, a little less when em ployed by the government, and least of all when teaching at a college.. Of course there are exceptions. James C. G. Conniff, who teaches at a small, eastern liberal arts college, is such an exception. He published an ar ticle in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "" I'm A Teacher Who's Getting Rich."" Only trouble is that Conniff isn't talking about money. He writes: "" Taking boys and making men who can stand on their-own two feet . . . that is the kind of spiritual property a man can occupy tax-free for a lifetime .. . Once you possess it you can never go broke."" '' * * * * * In a recent meeting devoted entirely to the problem of chapel attendance, the Earlham College Senate adopted the three following steps: to meet the cur rent situation on this campus: 1. Senate will continue to pass out cards'in chapel and assembly in order to get an accurate list of students who are habitually absent; 2. Senate repre sentatives will be posted at strategic points to speak to students who are not in chapel; 3. The executive committee of the Senate will appoint a special com mittee, drawn from the ranks of Senate and the general student body, to study the problem, adopt corrective measures, and supervise the fullfilltaent of these measures. The third motion grew out of a proposal by Earlham's President, THomas- j E. Jones. He briefly recounted the system in use here before the honor sys tem was adopted under which seats were assigned and attendance checked.. A. I student who missed a specified number of times was deprived of class credit. ""The Earlham Idea is developed by going to chapel,"" 'Dr. Jones declared.. He said that chapel attendance is not permanently on the Honor System. It is actually on a six month trial basis which has been renewed by the faculty each time it expired. One hundred per cent attendance is the goal President Jones described as the ultimate objective. He expressed; favor toward! the | Senate's taking action and suggested a committee to apply social pressure on habitual absentees. * * * * * * The University of Texas College of Fine Arts will offer a new radio-tele vision broadcasting degree next fall. The University is the first school in. Texas to offer a degree in the fast1-growing- video- fijeM. The number of U. S. universities,with television: programming courses has. jumped from 53 last year to 60 now.. Only 18 schools have television, work shops. The University's TV workshop, under the direction of E. R. Norris, is a joint project of the Department ofDrama and Radio House. An arrangement with a San Antonio television 'station enables students to use that station's, facilities much as they would a regular laboratory on the campus:."

Colleges Not Asked To Accelerate,"The U. S. Department of Defense has not requested educational institu tions to accelerate their academic programs, Robert L. Williams, assistant to the provost of the Univ. of Michigan, declared recently. Williams is serv ing as the co-ordinator to keep the University in touch with developments at Washington relating to the national emergency. He quoted an assistant secretary of the Army as saying, "" The Depart ment of the Army has no request the'colleges' and universities to accelerate their academic programs at this time."" Williams said similar views had been indicated to the University by repre sentatives of the Navy, Marines and Air Force. He pointed out that the armed forces are serious in this point of view since neither the military aca demy at West Point nor the naval academy at Annapolis had been asked to speed up their educational programs. Williams also pointed out that extensive special training programs such as colleges and universities taught for the armed forces during the last war are not contemplated at this time by the armed forces. May 4, 1951 | Dear Editor: I am addressing this only to the persons who had the audacity to take or may I use the words ""deliberately stole"" twenty-one dollars from my husband's wallet,, while he was showering after a game of tennis on Friday morning, 11:00 to 12:00 a. m. in the Davis Gymnasium. I am just a G-I's wife trying to raise a nine month old son and make ends meet on a mere $120.00 a month. I do not write this letter begrudg ingly, but if your needs were far greater than ours--I shall stop here. Sincerely, (Name withheld) Editor's Note: Students and faculty who initiated the V/heat-to-India movement and presented Mr. Saksena with a check for $330.00 in New York received this letter of thanks this week. Dear Sir: The gift you are giving is a reflec tion of your generous and kindly feel ings towards the suffering people of India. The people of India have cherished the most friendly feeling towards the people of the United States and these sentiments would be further strengthened because of the help you are now giving to India in her hour of need. The magnitude of the gift is a matter of little conse quence. What is important is the spirit behind the gift. It is this spirit of friendship and good will which lives, and consecrates human relationships. It is unfortunate that, at the pres ent time, there are people who cast doubts on our friendship towards the people of the United States. They misunderstand the meaning of friend ship. A real sincere friend is not one who flatters you and approves everything you do, but rather one who supports you fully when you are right and does not hesitate to criticize you when he feels you are going wrong. It is indeed a pity that misunder standings of this kind should exist. They are perhaps inevitable. But it is action like yours today which will resolve them. The future of the world rests with the young people of today. If they are brave and strong, patient and understanding, we can confidently look forward to an era of harmony and peace. I thank you again /o r your generous gesture. Sincerely, R. R. Saksena, Consul General of India in New York. Wmmim"

Lambda Chi Alpha Wins Cup For Third Time;,
Fishing Village Theme Retires IFC Prize,"The Bucknell Debating Society has finished the 1950-51 season with an average of .630. The group partici pated in 71 intercollegiate debates, with a record of 41 wins, 24 losses, 1 tie, and 5 no-decision debates. This total represents one of the most ac tive and most successful seasons in the post-war era of debating at Buknell. Debates were held with 36 colleges and universities. Some of these schools were entertained on the Buck nell campus, while the others were met by Bucknell either on the home campus or in intercollegiate debating tournaments. Many Trips Made Trips were made to the New York City area, to Philadelphia, to Wash ington, and to the Buffalo area. In addition the Bucknell debaters par ticipated in the Temple Novice Tour nament, in the new Kings College Tournament, the annual Mount Mercy College Tournament, the Debate Tour nament of Pennsylvania College at Temple, and in the West Point Re gional Elimination Tournament at State College. At the Mount Mercy gathering the Bucknell representa tives tied for second place with a record of six out of eight, and at the Debate Tournament of Pennsylvania Colleges, Bucknell won seven out of eight in the preliminary rounds, went on to the semi-finals, and ranked fourth in the final standings. Next Season Plans are already under way for another active season in the 1951-52 school year under the new debate manager, Bob Bimbaum. Professor Frank Merritt of the English Depart ment will continue as coach. Stu dents are reminded that an active in terest is the only formal requisite for membership on the team. Either Pro fessor Merritt or Bob Birnbaum will be pleased to speak to any interested students."

The New England fishing town theme of Lambda Chi Alpha was un animously awarded the IFC rotating cup for the best Houseparty decora tions last weekend. Phi Gamma Delta's "" Holiday Mag azine"" and Sigma Alpha Epsilon's ""Artistry In Rhythm"" were runners up with second and third places. Retire Cup Lambda Chi faithfully carried out its theme with a lighthouse, dock, and fishing boats on the outside and a complete New England village replica on the inside. By winning the cup for three times ('48, '49, '51), LCA retires the cup. The Phi Gam decorations were as international as the Lambda Chi's were local. A motor boat and a semi-French taxi-cab shared honors !on the lawn, while travel posters from all parts of the world were fea tured inside. - Musical Theme The SAE's took third place on a musical note with various instruments pictured on the outside of the house and musical scales featured inside along with sketches of famous orches tra leaders. Stan Kenton's likeness beat time with his baton above the entrance. The winning decorations were se lected on the basis of inside and out side decorations, originality, continu ity of theme and completeness of the area included. Each house was rated from 1-10 on these five points. The three judges were"" Professor Neil F. Schiffler, Mrs. Flomce Utt Focht and John H. Shott. Some Weekend! The weeknd was everything that everyone expected. Pins dropped, potential W. C. Fields were'delirious ly happy. All kinds of things happened. People fell in creeks, baseball games progressed, with much prowess dem onstrated by many would-be boy ath letes. The other house decorations lasted out the weekend somehow. Of course maybe the perspective of the decor changed, but it was all in the mind. <PSS"

Many Momentos Femmes wound up with crested momentos of the weekend, cigarette cases, cigar clippers, and othr trivia.

To Notch Seasons Sixth Win,"The Red Devils of Dickinson College invaded the University Courts yester day pm but had only the red marks of defeat at sundown as the Bison netmen outclassed the Carlisle travelers 8-1. , Only one match fell to the visitors0 and that in the doubles bracket. The remaining doubles and all singles matches went down in the records as Bison wins. Singles Notched Hank Peter's number one man, Paul Remmey, had to fight hard for the first set but came up on top 8-6. In the second set he handcuffed Dickin son's Epstein 6-0 to take the match. In the second go it was Captain Gray Rodgers.: versus the Red Devils Twain. Rogers had some trouble in the first set but took his match 7-5 and 6-4. Bison Bill Reitz downed Hoover of the visitors 6-0 and 6-1 without too much trouble. Hess Steady Skip Hess provided the thriller of the day as he downed Steiner 6-2 in the first set but had to pull the second go out of his bag o f tricks by playing 16 games before he emerged on top 9-7. A1 Goff made it victory number five for the Herd as he garnered 6-2 and 6-4 wins over Coslow from Car lisle. Nick Schloeder rounded out a perfect day for the singles as he downed Owens 6-1 and 6-1. A1 Goff and Gray Rogers were the only doubles men to drop their match as they met some very stiff competi tion in the Red Devil's strings. The other Herd teams, Mufson-Larson and Hess-Reitz won their matches to leave the Devils with mighty crimson faces when they read the final to be BU ,8 Dickinson 1. New Javelin Record 1 .

FROSH BASEBALL PRACTICE,
Netmen Lose To Maryland;,
"Remmey, Golf Cop Wins As",
Terps Annex Two Doubles,"by Bruce Swanger The Penn State bound Maryland tennis team stopped long enough in Lewisburg, Friday, to beat the Bison netmen, 6-3, on University Courts. Off To State The boys from College Park were not making a regularly scheduled visit to the local campus. Their pri mary objective was State College and the unbeaten Nittany Lions, but on the insistence o A1 Humphreys they consented to stop for the return en gagement as an added attraction to house party weekend. In a previous meeting of the two teams March 31 on the Maryland courts, the Terps downed the Bisons, 7 to 2. The well balanced Maryland team was never extended beyond the mini mum two sets in acquiring their six points. Rogers Loses In singles matches, Rogers bowed to Huyett 6-4, 6-2; Reitz lost to Mc- Cool 6-4, 6-4; Hess was victimized by Kehoe 8-6, 6-2, and Schloeder was de feated by Childs 6-4, 6-4. The Mary landers added their other two points in doubles, when McCool and Huyett teamed to down Rogers and Schloeder 6-0, 6-0 and Kehoe and Childs won over Hess and Mufson 6-2, 6-1. Bucknell's number one man, Paul Remmey, improving with each match, had little trouble in disposing of Tom Beight 6-0, 6-1 for the Bison's initial point. Goff had a little more difficul ty with his opponent, but finally emerged with Bucknell's second point by virtue of a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over O'Steen. When the hour grew late and the athletes grew hungry, the third doubles match was defaulted."

Bretz Stops Albright On 4 Hits;,
Baseballers Near Playoff Berth,by Bill LeMon * Brilliant four-hit pitching by newcomer Bud Bretz moved the Bison base ball squad one step nearer a Middle Atlantic Playoff berth Tuesday as they de feated Albright 3-1. Bretz pitched a masterful game while Bill Lane's charges jumped on Albright pitcher Mjuller for nine hits.
Trackmen Assault All-Time Marks',"Long Scores Art Long started the Bison scoring by taking first on a walk in the open ing frame and then tallied on Abe Powelson's single. Hits by DiGui- seppi and Shirk combined to send Shirk across the plate for another run in the third inning. In the home team's half of the fourth a double by Martone with no one out was turned into a run by Sitt- lings long triple which was prevented from being a home run by a brilliant throw by Franke. Bucknell's last run was scored when Webber's one- base clout was followed by a hit from the tat of DiGuiseppi, bringing the fast shortstop across the plate.. Fourth Straight This game marked the fourth straight win for the Lanemen and the seventh Middle Atlantic victory in eight starts. Bretz's sterling per formance may have demonstrated to Lane that he has one more dependable pitcher for the Middle Atlantic play offs on May 18 and 19. Two hits each by McKibbin, Di Guiseppi and Powelson coupled with one hit by Jack Webber brought their respective batting averages to .350, .469, .352 and .325. Bill Lane has issued a call for all freshmen who are interested in base ball for next year to report at the stadium on Monday at 3:30 o'clock. Coach Lane said that the practice will last for the entire week with a game between the varsity and the freshmen later on in the week."
GOOD LUCK GOLFERS,
IN JUNIATA TOURNAMENT,"Two all-time Bucknell track records have already fallen and the 1951 as sault on the record books may produce other record marks. John Schaum berg and Stan Butterworth became the first two members of the 1951 team to break existing marks when they eclipsed the javelin and shotput marks respectively in the Muhlenberg meet last Saturday. A listing of the Bucknell all-time records reveals that the oldest record now on the books is in the 220 yard sprint. The record was set by Charles Pearse, class of '01, when he traveled hte distance in 21 seconds flat. Other old records include the 4:32.6 min. mile set by Cameron A. Butt, class of TO. But also holds the two mile record with a time of 9:52.8 minutes."

"FRANKE, ROUSH HOMERS",
DECISIVE AS CHUCKERS,
SQUELCH MUHLENBERG,"by Ellwood Rowe The rejuvenated Bison nine, full of all the fire and will to win needed to be a winning combination, roared to their sixth win of the current season last Saturday as they turned back the invading Muhlenberg Mules 10-7. Sophomore Dave Lucas and senior Dick Roush collaborated on the mound in holding the opponents to nine scat tered hits. Roush, ater relieving Lu cas who started, hurled the last four and one-third innings and allowed only one hit during his stay on the hill. Fraitke Homers Successive homers by Bill Franke who batted for Cal Rough in the eighth, and Roush respectively, were the pay-off markers which accounted for four runs and spelled the margin of victory. Franke's round tripper into left center came with two men on base. Marty McKibbin singled to start the eighth and then stole second. Bill Keay, hitting for Brad Myers, was hit by a pitched ball-- setting the stage for Franke's circuit clout,, his first of the season- Earlier the Lane- men had picked up a singleton in the first and five more runs on only three hits in the1 third: The Muhlenberg aggregation from Allentown scored single tallies in  the second, third, and seventh innings and two runs in both the fourth and. fifth frames. Leading stickmen for the Mules were their number four and five hitters in the batting lineup, Jackson, .and Mazzocca, who alone acounted for over half their squad's hits. Elmo Jackson, former Allentown High standout, collected two hits out of five trips to the late while Mazzocca connected1 for three safeties in five attempts. Roush Triples Marty McKibbin had "" two for four"" ' for the victorious Herd, and Roush had a triple besides his four bagger to give him a perfect day at the plate. The win was number three for Roush; he has two defeats. Bill Franke made his homer the hard way in the eighth as he had! to scramble to his feet again after run ning over Busolitz, Muhlenberg key stone tender,, who had gotten into his way. Not to be denied, Franke sped around third and still beat the long throw in from the outfield1 in; deep left center.

"Rogers, Hess Spark Win","by Harry McSorley A  two game losing streak was halt ed by oach Hank Peters' varsity ten nis team on Tuesday afternoon, as the Bisons soundly whipped Albright Col lege by a one-sided 6-3 score on the losers' courts in Reading, Pa. Not withstanding the fact that Bison ace Paul Remmey was unable to make the trip, along with veterans Nick Scholeder and Maurice Mufson, the Bucknell netmen nevertheless flashed a consistent brand of court play to win their fifth collegiate match of the present campaign. Rogers Wins Captain Gray Rogers handled him self smoothly as he took the first two sets of his singles match 6-3,- 6-0. Likewise encountering no serious dif ficulty in his singles competition, Bill Reitz mastered his opponent with 6-4 and 6-2 scores. Maintaining the steady, accurate game which he has recently been dis playing, Skippy Hess cam ethrough after being slightly pressed in the first set to win 7-5, 6-2. Alan Goff, fresh from an impressive singles vic tory over his University o f Maryland opponent last Saturday, continued to improve his game by trouncing his Albright foe 6-2, 6-1. Bucknell captured two of the doubles matches, losing the third on a default. The combinations of Rogers- Reitz and Diffendaffer-Robb swept the doubles without being extended."

Trackmen Edged In Initial Meet;,
Counter By Drubbing Dickinson,"by Howard Macauley Bison tracksters, edged 64-62 in their initial dual encounter of the current season at Muhlenberg last Saturday, breezed home with a 90 1/2-35 1/2 drub bing of Dickinson College on the Memorial Stadium track last Tuesday. Individually, John Schaumberg and? -- ------------------------------------- -- -- Stan Butterworth erased two BU field records while competing against the Mules at Allentown. Schaumberg cracked the 1950 javelin record set by Chet Leach as he heaved the spear 183 1/2 feet. The previous mark was 181 1/2 feet. Butterworth bettered the shotput standard as set by Conti in 1936 by five inches with a 45' 4"" toss. Schaumberg Sets Pace Schaumberg, captain of the Orange and Blue harriers, paced the Bisons with 15 points, while his running mates blanked 'the Cherry and White Dickinson speedsters in five of four teen events. Schaumberg leaped to a 21' 7"" victory in the broad jump, countered with a 5' 6"" stalemate in the high jump, copped third place honors in the 880 yard run and topped the day with a 187' 6"" heave of the javelin. His toss with the Finnish spear broke his own BU record but was rendered unofficial because of a slight tailwind. Coach Bus Blum's runnerup for point producing laurels, A1 Farina, compiled 11 digits by placing second in the Century, second in the broad jump and sped to a 25.4 victory in the 220 low hurdles. Stewart, LePard Win Chuck Stewart, who collected a 10.1 win in the 100 yard dash and a 22.4 victory in the furlong, ranked third in the scoring parade while Jim Le Pard amassed nine points with a 53.2 win in the quarter-mile, second in the 220 yard dash, and third in the 220 low hurdles. Smallest Margin In edging the Bison Thinclads, Muhlenberg registered its victory by the most minute margin--two points. The Mule's Rulley stole the meet spotlight by copping a triple win while LePard and Farina tied for the Herd's scoring wreath with ten points apiece. LePard annexed the 220 and 440 yard dashes as Farina bagged seconds in the broad jump, pole vault, 220 low hurdles and a third in the Cen tury. Schaumberg reaped nine points and Stewart collected eight, while Butterworth and Bowen were the only other Bisons to garner first place wins."

xx3exxx%x%xxx%xx%xxxxxxxxxsexxsaexxxxiixxstxxxiexxsexxxxxitxx,"by Bobbie Maurer Dr. George Kunkel, professor of mechanical engineering, has risen from instructor 1920-1935, to assistant professor 1935-1944, to associate professor 1944-1948, and finally to the position of professor in 1949. P ................. - .....-- ..... -- ----- - Dr. Kunkel was bom  on a farm near Lewisburg, and as a boy he at tended a rural school in Union Coun ty. He went on to college, and grad uated from Bucknell in 1919, with the degree of B S in mechanical engineer ing. Then in 1920, he received an M. S. in mechanical engineering here. In the summer of '26, he attended the graduate school of the University of Michigan, and during a leave of ab sence from Bucknell, he received his Ph. D. degree from Cornell in 1932. The subject of his major thesis was "" Testing Radiators in a Vacuum for Direct Radiation and Convection."" Helped Build Hunt Hall Dr. Kunkel was married in 1924 to Helen Egge, a graduate of Blooms- burg State Teacher's College, and has a daughter, Nancly Lou. In past years he has been quite busy around Bucknell. In 1920 he helped draw plans for the addition to the Chemical laboratory. The next year he super vised the erection of the mechanical engineering wing o f the Engineering building. Later, as engineer for Bucknell, he supervised the grading of the North Athletic Field. In 1923 he helped remodel the Power House. The girls in Hunt Hall owe their lodging partly to Dr. Kunkel, for he supervised the erection of all the steel work for that building. Dr. Kunkel is a member of both the American Society of Mechanical En gineers and the American Society of Engineering Education, and since 1939, he has been registered as a professional engineer. He is also a member of the Lewisburg club, and his special interests include bowling, fishing, tennis, and golfing."

Prospect Of Lit Quiz Upsets,

IN DEFENSE OF SIDEMEN,"....... Every so often the Cat gets burned up about the fate of almost complete ob scurity given to the sidemen of the nation's top bands. They're just sidemen, period, and there's little at tempt on the part o f bandleaders to make more of them. Run through the big dance bands today and see how many featured musicians you can name. Not many, I'm sure. That goes for me, too. Trouble is nobody seems to want you and me to know. That may not be the conscious reason today, but it's still amazing how few leaders try to build up their sidemen. To the Cat, such an atti tude is a serious mistake, because the personal interest angle is a very im portant one in the promotion of a band. Going to hear an outfit play without knowing who is in it is very much like going to a ball game with out knowing who the players are. In the good old days (accent on the first adjective), it wasn't thus. Then everybody knew who was playing what, and, in many cases, they could even hum their recorded choruses. In the good old days, dance band busi ness was very good. Don't think that these two facts are entirely un related. What's the matter with the band leaders? Don't they care? Do they think it will interfere with their own reputations? Such thinking is both short-sighted and stupid. Band fans don't want to talk only about a lead er's hair or his teeth or the way he stands in front of a band. They're interested in the band itself, and they want to talk about all its parts. Until they're once more given an opportun ity to know the objects they're sup posed to and want to support, the band business will remain where it is today--nowhere! The CAT hears that BING CROS BY has made a "" brand-new"" epic- musical film. It is a remake of the old ABBOTT & COSTELLO opus, "" In the Navy."" The plot tells of an immigrant Irish lad who becomes a national hero by saving J. EDGAR HOOVER from the venomous clutches of the House Un-American Affairs Committee. Crosby has some fair songs in this one, including WHAT"

But somehow, possibly from the effect of unaccustomed cramming, certain individuals on our hall began to crack under the strain. I'm going to attempt a small sum mary o f this last night, better known as the "" H-Hour."" (Please confine your translation to yourself). Along about 11 o'clock my room- #mate and I are, like all little frosh, reading our lit when two small figures slip into the room. However, we didn't, pay much attention to them because people are always coming in and out. Finally, though, I became annoyed and shouted, "" LEAVE and shut the door after you!"" They left, but hearing no slam, I became very suspicious and decided to investigate. I stalked over, reached out to turn the knob ....... knob? door? No knob. No door. As I stood there in my doorless doorway, I became aware o f a small, but noticeable, pile o f doors accumu lating in the hall. Much later two apologetic figures explained to fifteen irate girls that they had to do some thing to relieve the nervous tension. After all we wouldn't want them to build up a mental block,, would we, I girls? Hm-m-m-m-. One type of Lit scholar is the girl who needs energy to study. She reads with one hand in the crackers and a jar of peanut butter in the other. She got the urge to try a new dish tonight-- stewed prunes. The directions on the box are very simple, any mad fool could follow them. But does she read directions? No. She has a sure-fire method. She retires to an unknown section o f the all's quiet and we are congratulating ourselves on such an intelligent move when we hear the front door open and close. I shut my eyes and pray for the worst. I got my wish. We had sort o f overlooked the fact that Coun sellors are privileged to take 12:90 o'clocks. Disguised in a pair of red striped pajamas, I sheepishly bid the surpris ed couple a feeble "" good night"" and crawl up the stairs. A plaid bath robe accompanied by a pair of red flannels in the general outline of my roommate follow in my wake. Min utes later, a polka-dot job, which had been unobtrusively and unsuccessfully trying to fade into a shady part of the living room, floated up the stairs. Nevertheless, all's well that ends well. It's morning now and the cold gray dawn is creeping through my window. As I begin to get dressed for my 8 o 'clock class--this hopeful thought seeps through my Lit-weary brain. Lit is just like measles t everybody gets it at one time or an other, but no one seems to have any lasting battle scars from it. Except perhaps this poor columnist who observes and records Lit scholars studying for the unavoidable-- a Lit quiz!"

Sunshine Park On Dorm Roofs;,
Results: Men With Strained Eyes,"by Shirley Kistler Swing a little more to the right Bill, a little more--There, Wow! You've got it get a load of those gams. Catch the color of the one on the far end- ooh la la. No, people this isn't two business0 -- -- ------------------------------------------------ men at a peep show, it is just the en gineers with telescopes in their sur veying instruments eyeing the Sem Gems. Who left the shades up? Shades nothing, the ladies took a slice out of the front of Hunt and now recline on a balcony indulging in their daily ritual of worship to the sun God. If your eyes are in gear, you may have noticed the same ceremony be ing enacted on Lari son roof (this re quires an airplane or an SAE pin) and in the yards of the different houses (even conducted in Spanish and French). Much time and energy .is devoted to the ceremony. To be come a member of this cult, you must first of all be willing to move all the necessary equipment from your room to the worship grounds. This con sists of oils (those only that are fit for a baby's skin quality) or creams, or vinegar, or plain water (for peas ants) to be used to protect the epi dermis and to coax the sun into trans- fering winter white into a glistening tan. Time is measured in terms of the layers of tan acquired. The most energy used is in moving equipment. Have you ever tried carrying a blan ket, a pillow (without case), bobby pins, comb, various ointments, a lit' book, and a deck of cards in one trip ? Believe me, the ladies are developing muscles. Lunch A Problem Lunch presents a problem to every sun devoter--to attend or not to at tend is the question. Stomach says attend--skin says don't. Being as there is more skin than stomach and we live in a democracy where majority rules the skins win. With each sunny day the dining hall becomes emptier and emptier, and not to be outdone the classrooms follow suit. It's real ly great of the teachers to give un limited cuts in the interest of the stu dent's health--ah such kindness. At first the goal was a tan for houseparty weekend but with this past, a May Day bum is the style. Lest I have you under the impres sion that only the Seih Gems make up this idyllic sun worshipers society, I'll add that the Kappa Sigs and the SAE's have been seen on their re spective roofs-- and they weren't fix ing the shingles either."

'Spring Fever' Reigns Supreme,""" Spring has sprung, the grass has riz, I .wonder where the students is."" The library is deserted, silence reigns in the dorms, and books are idle on the desks. It is a malady commonly known as ""spring fever."" A description of this change which0 has come over the campus is likely to cause professors to wring their hands and utter protests to their "" former"" students. From their point of view, they have cause to worry. No longer do they see students hurrying to the library. Instead, couples strolling arm in arm are taking walks and heading in the general direction of the golf course or Red Rock. If one questions them, the couples reply that they are developing "" a deeper appre ciation of nature."" Some couples consider themselves more fortunate because they have a car. Suddenly, everything from Model A 's to shiny new convertibles appear on campus so that one receives the impression that General Motors has just built a factory in Lewisburg With picnic baskets in the trunk these cars head gaily to Halfway with merry shouts and singing coming from their occupants. The holiday often starts about eleven in the morn ing, and the girls just make it back to the dorm in time to meet the twelve thirty deadline. Yes, spring is here and books, the library, and classes are a thing of the past. Help Keep Bucknell Green Use The Paths!

Sigma Delta Pi Elects,"Sigma Delta Pi, national Spanish honorary, met recently at Spanish House to elect officers for 1951-52. In discussing plans for next year, it was decided that special programs of movies and talks would be included. Lee Henry was re-elected president of the group. Other officers are Carol Cleaves, vice president and pro gram chairman, and Mary Grace Jones, secretary-treasurer. That was six and one-half years ago, when an unassuming looking man first took over the newly organ ized Bucknell Police force; the scene was the back of a grocery store; the woman, a Lewisburg matron; the hired gunman, Paul A. Lemmon-- Chief of the Campus Cops. At 'that time, the war had caused radical changes in Bucknell proced ure; for instance, women were quar tered in fraternity houses. During the winter, after hours,- women's foot prints were often seen in the snow leading away from the greek houses. Surprise fire drills and spot checks stopped that. Theft of 30-lb. Roast One of the first capers the force dealt with was the theft, by fratem ity men, from the women's dining hall, of a prepared 30-lb. roast, from under the Chef's nose. Police found the grisly remains too late to save the roast, but the students paid for it. "" I never have the car parked on the campus,"" is the standard excuse of all Bucknellians caught without per mits. The excuse seems valid except that the driver usually says it while parked on the hill. 5% Mischief Makers Automobiles, drinking, firecrackers', and pranks are the biggest worries for the police from the students. "" And 90% of the trouble,""  said Chief Lem mon, ""involves the same 5% of the students every time. Actually, the students do violate auto regulations and the like; but the more serious charges-- prowlers to peepers to bur glaries--usually aren't committed by Bucknellians."" "" But there are the jokers,"" the ! chief continued, remembering many I of the incidents he and other officers had gone through, "" For some reason, I fraternity sharp shooters took a lik ing to the clock in West College Tower. We caught them taking pot shots at it with .22 caliber rifles. Don't know why they did it, though."" At this moment, Chief Lemmon was interrupted a minute by some of the watchmen checking into the office down in West College basement, be- fore starting the long trek around the darkened campus. The three watch men comprise half the force; a relief man, a daytime officer to direct trif- fic, and Paul Lemmon are the other three. Watching the watchmen leave reminded the speaker of one of the hardest things a new watchman must learn. "" Often after dark,"" he explained, The empty buildings groan and crack, making weird sounds so that the novice officer must learn quickly the difference between a creaking plank and a falling footstep."" Missing Xmas Trees Christmas season, the first year of ficer Lemmon was here, coeds, as per custom, threw out their Christmas trees before vacation. During this time, men were serenading the Sem. Late one night, three of them sneaked up to the Girls' Honor House as Chief Lemmon ducked behind the porch) The three students disappeared as he stood up. But shortly after, they re turned-- each hidden behind a wilted Christmas tree. Scenes from Macbeth were conjured up by the lawman as he rose to met the walking woods. But "" Don't shoot mister! I'm just an old Christmas tree!""  was all one student could say before the trio dropped the tres and ran. Bucknell police have jurisdiction in any of the cities and boroughs in Union and Snyder Counties-- not just the campus. The only thing they can't do is serve subpoenas-- as one constable learned when he asked for aid to serve papers on a Bucknellian dow non his alimony dues. Salesman, minister, plain clothes- man with the State Department of Revenues, officer in the Game Com mission, time study engineer, watch man, carpenter, plasterer, instructor of mechanical engineering here, and poet; these are some of the positions Paul Lemmon has crammed into his forty-five years. As a poet, he was recognized by no less an authority than Prof. Willard Smith of World Literature fame, who uses his parody of William Blake's Tiger, Tiger in English 104. Read The Bucknellian!

The 'Old Man' Comes Through,"One of the amazing features of the May Day weekend was the announcement that the Father's Association stole the mother's thunder when the ""old men"" kicked in with a gift to the University of over $5,000. Needless to say this represents a sizeable gift in these times of inflation. One other important fact announced at the same meeting concerned the Student Loan Fund which the Association admin isters to help out students in occasional financial embarrassment. Dean Musser told the Father's that the original amount of $500 in the fund now represented a turnover of over $4,000. Quite a financial help to needy Bucknellians. It won't be his day for another month but no one helped make Mother's Day more of a success than the ""old man."""
Who's Joined Whom?,"Has Bucknell joined the Arm y or has the Arm y joined Buck- nell? No matter from which angle you prefer to look at it, the fact remains that the Arm y is officially here. Colonel Besser and his staff are busy establishing the R. O. T . C. program here and the interesting glances thrown the way of the male population represent more than idle curiosity. Mounds of Army literature are floating around and many of the underclassmen are beginning to speculate about their appear ance in khaki. The program is still somewhat of a mystery to most but the men have Colonel Barnes' promise that things will clear up before long. The best we can do now is extend a Bucknell ""hello"" to Colonel Barnes and his staff. Hello, sir, that is."

Armed Forces Day,"This Saturday is Amed Forces Day. For most college men the part they will play in the celebration of this day seems to be pretty well decided. The world situation demands the sacrifice of personal desires and no one is in a better ""position"" to ""ac cept"" the responsibilities than the college man. Few college men look forward to giving up their immediate plans for a job to accept Army service. Few men look forward to preparation for war and service overseas. Nevertheless, the die has been cast and the issue decided. It might be a good idea if everyone would stop to think a minute Saturday about the Armed Forces and their part in the destiny of the world. A little thought before this time might have pre vented the need for an Armed Forces Day. 4:30 p.m. 4:30 p.m. 4:30 p.m. 6:45 p.m. 7:00 p.m THURSDAY, MAY 17 Cap and Dagger Meeting . ........"

ROVING PHOTOGRAPHER,"------ There's a photographer "" operating"" on campuses in the south who has a unique way of taking pictures. His subjects aren't too fond o is me , if a notice posted in a women's dormitory at a southern university is any proo The notice said: "" It has come to our attention that a pseudo-photographer is operating on different college and university campuses in the Southern area. He is report ed to follow this procedure: 4 "" He calls the coed by phone, usually by name, stating that he is a pro- fessonal photographer taking pictures for magazine covers and stating that the coed has been referred to him by one of her friends; he then makes an ap pointment with the coed, takes a few pictures, and then (without the knowl edge or consent of the coed) cuts off large chunks of hair from the back of their head. * * >> * Hartford, Conn.-- (I. P.)-- Trinity College has established one of the most liberal student loan funds ever to be administered by an American college, it was announced here by President G. Keith Funston. ___ A revolving loan fund has been established with 80 per cent o f a $143,000 bequest from the late George J. Mead, an honorary Trinity alumnus and co founder o f Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Company, to be used for loans to stu dents specializing in the fields of Government, History, Economics, or Public Speaking. The bequest provides for short term loans of $100 or less to be repaid within 12 months (before graduation) and long term loans not to exceed $1,000 to be repaid within 5 years after graduation, each -without interest. The re maining 20 per cent of the bequest -will be used for prizes, lectures and other special purposes in the fields of Government, History and Economics. * * * * * Philadelphia, Pa.-- (I. P.)-- Drexel Institute of Technology has adopted plans to permit the entrance of a section o f its 1951 freshman class at the beginning of the Summer Quarter in June, 1951. This action is in keeping with recent announcements o f the U. S. Department of Defense encouraging college studnts to continue their courses of study. Concern has been express ed by representative engineering societies that the United States -will face a shortage of technically trained personnel, both in industry and in the armed forces. Dr. James Creese, Drexel's president, declared, "" We are concerned that the young men and women of this country have as much Education as possible before the time when they may be called upon for military service or defense. ""The academic year at Drexel is regularly divided into four terms or quarters. Therefore, the students now to be admitted at the beginning of the next Sum mer Quarter will be able to begin basic military training and complete all the course requirements for freshman and sophomore years by September, 1952. ; i Utilizing the Summer Quarters in 1951 and 1952, June freshmen will also be able to complete the five quarters o f training required for the R. O. T. C. Military Training Certificate. This award also enables students to qualify ! for selection for the R. O. T. C. Advanced Course at the Institute. Those se lected are subject to such deferment provisions as are set forth in current reg- gulations. At present, students entered upon the advanced course in various U. S. colleges are deferred until completion of the senior year and receipt of their commissions. * 3fC * * *"
NOT INFALLIBLE,"____ The Iowa State Daily commented: "" Republicans in general, and especially those of the more conservative kidney, in their violent attack on President Truman have added just one more plank in a tottering platform of inconsis- ; | tency. "" . . .  Republicans in congress seem to have the idea that MacArthur is God, and can do nothing which is wrong. He certainly is not infallible, despite an admirable record as a soldier."" * * * * *"
NOT ALL IT SHOULD B E -------,"The status o f civil liberties on the nation's campuses is not all it should be, according to a survey released last month by the American civil liberties union. Seventeen of 33 college newspapers reported instances of civil rights curtailment. Among the rights which were reported violated were: controversial speak ers on campus; Alumni attempts to check teaching material; faculty loyalty oaths; investigations; pressure on certain campus political groups. Eight universities and colleges, including Stanford, Michigan and Colum- I bia, reported difficulty in securing controversial speakers. Six institutions ! reported they had loyalty oaths-- California, Michigan, Notre Dame, North Carolina, Maine, Smith College and New Hampshire. All student editors reported complete freedom o f the college press, nor was there any indication that a student was ever expelled because of political j opinions. $ $ Jfc * 9k 8:30 p.m WEDNESDAY, MAY 23 11:00 a.m. Senior Chapel 10:30 a.m.-2 p.m. Phi Mu Bake S ale .....................

Say It Isn't So,"May 13, 1951 Dear Sir: Please say it isn't so. Tell me they aren't going to put a gold ball two feet in diameter on top- of the flag pole of the new. library. And please dear sir, tell me they aren't going to top this with a gold Bison plus a weather vane. What in the world are they build ing up there, a library or a deluxe stack of steel pancakes? I can't un derstand the method behind this engi neering madness. Many o f the students are worried over the prospect o f the library's be ing topheavy if those jackhammer jerks keep up their steady skyward climb.

MILLER TO PRESENT,
3RD ANNUAL RECITAL,
IN BAPTIST CHURCH,
A,"(c) 0 0 . May Day Court beauty reigneth supreme"" Mr. Russell Miller will present his third and last annual violin recital at the First Baptist Church on Tuesday, May 22, at 8136 p. m. The program. includes compositions from the Italian classical school, through the Romantic to the French Impressionistic period. Ernest Chaus- son's ""Poeme,"" for violin and orches tra, is recognized as one of the most exquisite compositions ever written for this instrument. Nadia boulang er, whose "" Nocturne and Cortege' will be performed, was the first wo man !ever tte tbe awarded the Prix de Rome in Music. Her brilliantly start ed career was Interrupted in .1918 by her untimely death at the age of 25. The most famous composition of the great Spanish violin virtuoso, Pablo Sarasate, is his "" Zigeunerwei- sen,"" or "" Gypsy .Airs."" The tune ""Golden Earrings"" is taken from this piece. Here .one must visualize a gypsy improvising melodies on his violin before a campfire. -The wild finale with its brilliant left-hand piz- zicati is an effective example of the gypsy style. The "" Introduction and Rondo Ca- priccioso"" is one of Camille Saint- Saens most famous compositions.

Lanemen Halt Temple Owls With Tenth Inning Walk; 6-5,
Bretz Relieves Roush In 9th;,
Shirk's Walk Forces In Run,"by Ellwood Rowe Forced to go into extra innings for the first time in the current season, the Orange and Blue baseball squad rose to the occasion Tuesday afternoon at Philadelphia by pushing across a run in the top of the tenth to hand Temple University a 6-5 setback--its ninth defeat of the season. For the victorious Lanemen. who are riding the crest of a five game winning streak, it was vic tory number eight as against only three sebtacks. Walk Pays Off Captain Andy Shirk, who all sea son has made a habit of drawing free tickets to first from opposing pitch ers, really made it pay off yesterday as he drew a base on balls in the top of the tenth, forcing Marty McKibbin over the plate with what proved to be the winning run. The Bisons were originally scheduled to meet the Wag ner College Seahawks at home, but the game with Temple was scheduled to fill in 'the spot left vacant by the Wagner cancellation. Marty McKibbin walked to start the pay-off tenth and went to second on a wild pitch by John Novak, who had relieved starter Tony DeLauren- tis. Bob Albert, catcher turned out fielder for this tilt, cameup with an infield single. Then Cal Kough bat ting for Art Long singled to fill the bases. Then came Shirk's walk and the victory for Bucknell. Top Two Tough The host Owls got to starter Dick Roush for four runs in the first two innings. In the initial frame they scored three times on two singles and a booming home run off the bat of A1 Bracalente. The fourth marker came across in the second inning on a base on balls, a sacrifice and an error. A singleton in the sixth ended the scor ing for the home taem. The Lanemen got back into the ball game in the third as they sent three runners scampering across home, and they forced the agme into the tenth as they tied it with two in the ninth. Jackie Webber singled home the fourth run on his second hit of the day. Shirk scored the tying run as John Havrisik booted Abe Powelson's grounder. Bretz Relieves Sophomore Bud Bretz was credited with his second win as he came on in the ninth to hurl shut out, no hit ball for two innings after Roush had been lifted for pinch runner Mai Sinclair in the top of the ninth after doubling. Roush toiled the first eight and gave up all six hits allowed the Owls. Re liefer John Novak suffered the loss for the Templers. Webber, Powelson, and Albert spearheaded the Orange and Blue's 11 hit attack as each slammed out two hits. Both teams committed two miscues behind their pitchers. Tempers flared briefly in the Temple half of the sixth. McKibbin was pulled off the bag at first by a wide throw, but he taggd the runner out, at least so it appeared to B. U. ob servers. However, the base umpire saw the play in a different light, and he called the runner safe. As per usual, the umpire's word reigned su preme, and the contest continued af ter a brief respite.

MORRIS,"MacArthur told Considine he knew Mathewson chiefly as a fine football player, and particularly long-distance punter before ""'Big Six"" came into prominence as a major league mound star. He recalled a Bucknell-Army game played at West Point near the turn of the century in which Matty kicked a pair of five-point field goals and averaged more than 50 yards per punt. MacArthur said he gave Walter Camp( originator of the All-Ameri can team idea, the name of Matty as the top fullback in the country during that season. Camp refused to O. K. Mathewson op the grounds that the Lewisburg institution subsidized its athldtes at that time.

Cop Nine Firsts In lacing their competitors, the Bison speedsters romped to nine first place victories, whieh included five field conquests and four running events. Jcjhn Schaumberg again set the pace for Bucknell as he snared a 20 foot, five-inch Win the broad jump and 173 foot, 3/4 inch javelin con quest and annexed second place hon ors in the high jump, discus and 880 yard run. Incidentally, Schaumberg in this encounter broke the current season's individual scoring record with a grand total of 19 points. A1 Farina, the Bison's diminutive flash, copped the 220 yard low hurdles in 26.4 seconds and bagged a second place in the broad jump and a tie for fourth place in the pole vault to cap ture the runnerup position in the scor ing parade. Frank Meredith, who raced away to a 4:46 mile victory and returned to bag third place in the half-mile and fourth in the two mile, coupled with Jim LePard, who gallop ed to a 53.7 win of the 449 yard dash and second position in the furlong, to round out Coach Bus Blum's top point producers. Sweep Shot Put The Herd's strongarm men, Stan Butterworth, Connie DeLoca, Sam Tschop and Bill Szabo in that order, tossed their opponents into oblivion in the shot put as they clearly swept the event. Butterworth's winning heave was 42 feet, 11 inches.

"THE BUCKNEHJAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.","THURSDAY, MAY 17, 1951,"
Art Students Hold Exhibit;,
Ace Reporter Reveals All,"itniiiititmimiiii by Bob Bell It has been brought to my attention that many people would like to know how college journalists get that way. In fact, all my fans have written to me asking just this question. In answer to both of them--here is the life story of the most charming, tal ented reporter I know--ME. I was born at an early age, in a small flat in New York. You know where New York is. It's a suburb of New Jersey. We were rather poor at the time, and it was only after my mother saw me that she went to the hospital. All in all, I had a rough baby-hood; no talc! Everything went along fine until I was three, then my parents left home. There I was; three and unemployed. I was too young to get into the Boy Scouts so I enlisted in the Air Corps. After my hitch was up I returned home having work ed out an agreement with my family --a muzzle. It was really a tough neighborhood we lived in. All the kids carried blackjacks in their pencil boxes. Of course, if you could handle your dukes you could probably live to a ripe old age--14 or 15. And talk about gambling--it got so bad that we even used to play poker with the teacher. Two guys would hold her, and the rest of us would poke her. I had a little trouble with my pri mary education. I was in the fourth grade for seven years. I wouldn't say I spent a lot of time in the cor ner, but I was the only kid in the class with a tri-cornered head. What with my dunce's cap, I was voted P. S. 75's answer to Mr. T. They finally had to promote me though--my electric razor was disrupting the class. I remember one day while I was sitting in the living room staring into the fire, my father rushed in and real ly bawled me out--we didn't have a fireplace. Aftr he calmed down a bit, he said to me, ""Bell (he could never remember my first name) Bell, how old are you."" ""Twelve,"""
I,"said. ""Twelve,"" he screamed. ""I was thir teen when I was your age."" And I can remember my first job. I was a grease monkey. I couldn't make a go of it, though, nobody want ed their monkeys greased. Then I got a job in a factory. I worked night and day, day and night. One day the boss came over to me and said, ""Bell, why are you working so hard?"" I said, ""Why boss?"" Then he told me--the factory had been closed for a month. Then I met her. What a dream! Lana Turner, Hedy Lamar, and Ava Gardner all rolled into one--372 pounds. What a girl she was. She fed me when I was hungry nursed me when I was sick, lent me money when"
t,"was broke--that girl needed me. Then we were married. We had a little trouble at the chapel, but final ly she solved the problem by going down the aisle sideways. I had a bit of trouble again when I carried her over the threshold of our little cot tage. Oh, well, I always wanted a sunken living room. After a few weeks I found she was eating me out of house and home. I decided that things could not get any worse so-- I enrolled at Bucknell. Art students have had their work on display in Roberts Hall for the past week. The predominating theme of spring represented in oils, pastels, and chalk mediums, has been express ed through landscapes, still life, fash ions and simple spring flowers. The variations are wide, but they are all typical of this season. Hint Of Spring That the red barn carries ,a hint of spring in it for Pennsylvanians, is ap parent in several paintings. Two, of the same barn, hang side by side, but the technique used on one lends to it an air of rustic disorderliness, while the other picture shows a trim red structure, so that at first glance it is not evident that both paintings have a relationship. It is obvious then, that the subjects chosen . make for variety. Landscapes of the neighboring countryside appear windswept or somber. They are true likenesses of this area, for Red Rock is easily rec ognized, and one would not have to look far to find a view from some hill side that would resemble the valley scenes portrayed. They might as easily, however, be either spring or fall scenes. Still Life Favorite A favorite interpretation of the season is by still life arrangements. Several pictures are of the same groupings, but again, the techniques ranging from modernistic to line for line exactness give an individualism to each painting. One student chose to make more interesting the bottle shapes and types of gourds by sug gesting through reflections in the bottles, other objects not in the pic ture. Such a device rouses the imag-1 ination and makes this one of the most intriguing pictures of its class. Pussy willow sprigs, the fresh yel lowness offorsythia and a vase of gay spring flowers, are, in general, some of the most effective paintings which sing of springtime with floral groups. | Spring hats and accessories have found their way into the exhibit too,, and blend in well with the mood. Sadness Contrasts In direct contrast to this seasonal theme, are a number of pictures in deep blue and black tones which im- | part a eeling of sad quietness. The light and shadow in them has"" been very subtly and well worked in. A n-! other artist has chosen to work with 1 more somber colors, but incorporates I dynamic figures that make his pic-1 tures bizarre and dramatic. Other paintings outside of the | spring mood are self portraits, bright I swatches of scenes from the art lab, and a refreshing original of the two ""Raggedy Ann"" dolls."

DUKE EL,"LINGTON came back from the west thru Chicago and headed east, with a band that jumps more than any unit Duke has had for many years. It has solid rhythm, and every man in the band is happy--and acts that way. WOODY HERMAN is in there, too. His new band sounds great and has all the earmarks of a crack dance ork. CLAUDE THORNHILL's new crew is also really something to hear. LES BROWN'S outfit is fine, as it always has been."
HARRY JAMES,"has begun a long tour of midwestern dance spots. TOMMY DORSEY's crew is leaping down in Texas, and his brother, JIMMY, is rocking them up in Frisco."
"RAY ANTHONY,","GENE KRUPA, SHEP FIELDS, and many others are producing fine dance music, and we're beginning to get some of the same on the airlanes and on records. And reports are that NBC and CBS are planning to air many remotes from ballrooms all over the country this summer. . It was just about a year ago that Down Beat planned and produced its special ""Let's Dance"" issue, designed to revive interest in dance music as such. At about the same time, Victor pressed and distributed its series of platters called ""Here Come the Dance Bands Again."" Other companies fol lowed suit, and disc jockeys joined the campaign by giving greater play to dance records than to vocal items. Now it appears that all this effort is about to bear fruit. Now that the ball is starting to roll again, maybe it will build up some momentum and everybody wil be dancing again."
FROM THE SCRAP'S CATBOOK,"--According to Walter Winchell, BING is saving two newspaper clip pings. One is a notice of his first movie in which Bing isn't even men tioned; the other is a review of a RUSS COLUMBO film which said: ""Russ Columbo has a fine voice but can't act as well as Bing Crosby, who | can't act at all."" ....... British-made I REX Records have an excellent slogan printed on their labels: ""Hear What You Like--When You Like."" That is j what the cat does when he gets tired I of listening to radio record programs and television. Some cartoons in the JAZZ JOUR- | NAL are very good. In the May, 1951 issue they show a knocked-out character with a washboard on his I lap turning his head around and say ing, ""Henry! Sound me a B-flat!"""
A GOOD ONE AND A STINKER--,"Les Brown's waxing of BLUE MOON is a warmly-voiced instrumental with a good beat and, as always with Les, gets played precisely. Fine dance music ....... The lemon is HARRY"
JAMES' MOON OF MANAKOORA,"and THEME FOR CYNTHIA. For mer is a lush instrumental so heavy it drags horribly. Harry sounds as if he were pretty tired of it. The latter is just as weary. Let me take you back to flight when I first interviewed some of' the performers and asked .them ""How did you feel when you looked at the audience on opening night?"" ' Amanda, the young ingenue por trayed by Berda Stout, said, ""My knees started to knock. And I kept wondering if the audience could see my knees shaking. I felt absolutely rooted to the spot."" Well, if Berda's knees were shaking When she walked on stage, I'rfl sure only the male members of the audience noticed it! As I thanked her and turned away, I heard the familiar bellow, ""Do I or don't I have the right to raise rab bits in my taxi?"" And quick like a bunny I knew it was Nick Schloeder, the mad taxi driver. Nick said, ""I felt scared, but after I started I was okay. I couldn't even look at the audience. I was too nervous."" The suave Prince, better known as Dick Larson, was ready to ride his English-imported bicycle on stage when I apprehended him. However, Le Prince in real life isn't half as worldly or blase as his stage charac ter would have you believe. Dick replie<f to my query with quite an unsophisticated statement. ""Nothing bothered me until I heard a familiar laugh, one of my fratern ity brothers, then I had to bite the sides of my cheeks to keep from laughing myself."" Hope Landrum, as the inimitable and immemorable Duchess, revealed an astonishing statement. In her best grande dame manner she said, ""I had such a bad cold and such a splitting headache that I didn't know what I was doing or what tljg audi ence was doing."" This rings true to the old theory that ""'Ze show must go on. The play's the thing. Keep up the good work, Hope! Cap and Dagger could do with more of, it. Bob Birnbaum, in the guise of the second Maitre d'Hotel, lifted his shag gy eyebrows and replied to my ques tion like this, ""Same old nervous re action, jitters, a little bit of the first night shakes. I was anxious and a little tense."" Well, the curtain ha another Cap and Dagger performance. The stage is dark and deserted and ""Leocadia"" is another happy memory in our 50 year book of successful per formances. But to the actors who played their parts so well, the drama of playing to the first night audience will never be forgotten. by Babs Feidler Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at the Campus Theater is Damon Run yan's ""The Lemon Drop Kid"" starring Bob Hope. Contrary to all you might think, this picture of a slightly crook ed guy who chews on lemon draps and gets mixed up with some ""old dolls,"" is good, and funny. So what if it is a take off from the story, Hope still does a good job. * * * * Thursday at the Capitol Theater in Milton is ""Raton Pass"" starring Den nis Morgan and Pat Neal. This is a mealy western and old in the bargain, Friday and Saturday at the Capitol is ""Meet the Invisible Man"" starring Abbott and Costello. * * * * Copping the honor for the worst week end of pictudes is the Strand in Sunbury. On the roster for Thurs day night is ""Molly"" (Goldburg, of course) starring Gertrude Berg, and Friday and Saturday is ""Tarzan's Peril."""
Phi Psi's Safe Looted,"Approximately $600 was stolen from the Phi Kappa Psi safe this past weekend, according to the fraternity officials. Milton State Police were called to investigate the robbery. The safe, containing all the money the men did not want to keep in their rooms, was said to be jimmied open, but no other information can be released at this rung down on * time. 111111101"

French Production Fascinates,
Exuberant C & D Participants,"by John Manbeck Leocadia. Leocadia! LEOCADIA! The publicity crews have screamed this name since the first week in April. Now you were about to view the Eng lish premiere of this French comedy. Noises issued from behind that curtain and you wondered why it moved so often. When it finally parted, you tried to read the thoughts in the actor's minds. o --... _________"
_,_________________
PAGE SEVEN,"All the participants in the produc tion of ""Leocadia,"" were exceptionally enthused about an exceptional play. The fervor began with the first phone call to author Jean Anouilh in France, and will not simmer down until com mencement. Rehearsals were long and tedious, occasionally causing tem pers to get out of control. Since the play was a fantasy, sets were hard to create. The black ""eyes"" were particularly troublesome to the Pro duction Staff. There Will Be Problems ""L"" Day drew closer, and more problems unveiled themselves. The lighting instructions wer misplaced. During the dress rehearsals, the ""champagne"" bottle repeatedly failed to pop for Bob Birnbaum, at the proper moment. On the premier of the performance, technical problems developed into personal problems. ""Leggy"" Pat Forlifer was desperately searching for half of her scanty cos tume. When it Was found at the last moment, a catastrophe--or spectacle --was averted. Broadway Producer Present The show began at 8:30 on Friday, with a Broadway agent and producer in the packed house. During Act I, Heroine Berda Stout wore the real orchid presented by Cap and Dagger. According to stage manager George Barker, the only backstage difficulty was in changing the sets between Scene 1 and 2 in Act I. Hank Pfisch- ner, the lighting manager, takes an optimistic attitude towards ""Leoca- dia's"" troubles. ""Most of the rough spots were smoothed out,"" he said. ""After all, though, they hold the show together."" The original music particularly en ticed show veteran Nancy Keller. When it played, she ""felt like doing a ballet."" Precision--Keyword The performance ran smoothly, with the stage crews working with exacting precision. Director Dick Osborn was thrilled by the successful curtain calls and the praise by the critics. Dick Larson, who was re sponsible for the set designs and ap peared in the portrayal of ""Le Prince,"" heaved a sigh of relief. In the make-up room, he confessed that ""Leocadia"" was ""one of the greatest of all plays C. and D. has produced,"" he added. ""Everyone worked >>so hard and I'm so grateful to them."" Perhaps Bill Kohland (assistant production manager) summed up the feelings and primary complaint of Cap and Dagger. ""There wasn't enough time for rehearsals. What we need is our private theater, so that the time is our own. The spirit is certainly here. Then, we could produce plays equal to any on Broad way."""
Master's Thesis Made Into,
Film About Sorority Girls,"""Take Care of My Little Girl,"" the forthcoming motion picture which delves into the sorority problem and campus snobbery, may have opened a brand new source of screen material for Hollywood. As far as is known, ""Take Care of My Little Girl"" is the first major movie to have its origin in a college student's master's thesis. Working for her master's degree at McGill University, Peggy Goodin turned in a manuscript titled ""A Crit ical Evaluation of Social Sororities."" Miss Goodin, who had earned her B. A. at the University of Michigan, eventually submitted her findings, re titled ""Take Care of My Little Girl,"" to E. P. Dutton & Co., and it was pub lished as a novel in 1950. Starred in ""Take Care of My Little Girl"" are Jeanne Crain, Dale Robert son, Mitzi Gaynor and Jean Peters. There is a large supporting cast of players who are themselves products of American colleges and universities from coast to coast."

"Leocadia,",
"""A.",
"Real Riot"" ;",
Critics Praise Publicity,"by Don Raphael As an effusive French taxi-driver put it, 'Hey, Josef--dis broad's a real not!' so was Cap and Dagger's performance of Jean Anouilh's fantasy Leo cadia, produced last Friday and Saturday flights in the LHS auditorium, a real riot of entertainment."
Q--.,"__________ _ ______________ The above comment, addressed by Nick' Schloeder with reference to Berda Stoudt, found a real person very much out of place in the world of fantasy that the Duchess (Hope Landrum) has created for her nephew the Prince, played by Dick Larson. Represents Battle The play itself, dealing with the decadence of the rich, is a battle of fantasy to conquer reality. In the end, reality wins, leaving fantasy to the world in which it belongs. While a bit abstract, the play as a whole was an enjoyable evening's entertain ment. Critics Speak At the critics forum on Sunday night, in Bucknell Hall at eight o'clock, the critics had this to say about 'Leocadia.' Mrs. Harold Cook was impressed by the fine advance publicity job. She liked the stage settings and felt that the props were adequate. The cast ing was very well done, and it afford ed her 'an adventure in the theatre.' The Duchess impressed Mrs. Cook with her fine inflection, tremendous variety of voice, but she also felt that that her walk detracted unnecessarily from the role. Short pants and a squared away beret made the Prince too much of a clean cut American boy, although Mrs. Cook believed he gave an 'ade quate' performance. Baron Hector was the kind of role that she hoped to see more of, as it was only a bit part, but none the less finely played by Web Smith. Pat Forlifer, as a hat-check girl, Mrs. Cook believed, looked like she was either at a bathing beach or in a bedroom, but never a hatcheck girl in a French night club, thanks to her costume. Mrs. Cook mentioned a piece of women's apparel that Pat's costume resembled, and felt that something should have been done about this. The two Maitre'd's were very fine she felt, and the two comic servants were also laudable. The Inn Keeper was natural, and very well done, and she also believed that Berda Stoudt as Amanda was 'very adequate.' Garvin Divides Criticism Harry R. Garvin, second speaker at the forum was 'willing and anxious to see the play again at commence ment time . . .' He divided his criti cism into sections dealing with the various structural parts of the work. The author tried to fuse real and fantasy with a suggestion in the end of a triumph of the real, and he also attempted to fuse words and music. Phone 5-8933 >>"
HELEN G. LYONS,
Gift Shop,"411 Mkt. St. Lewisburg, Pa. Poulin, who composed the music for the play, worked hand in hand with Anouilh to effect this fusion. Mr. Garvin felt that there were certain inadequacies in the handling of the humor, stating that it was not subtle enough for French humor. The nightclub scene could have been more blase, representing the class of no bility that the play dealt with. He liked Amanda, felt she was 'ex tremely successful.' She had a sense of earthiness, was not a French in genue, acted with dignity, and grew sure of her awareness of things. The Duchess should have been more of a pixie then an aristocrat, being only five feet tall in the French original. The orchestra was most excellent, al though the music at times became background music which it should not have been. Gummo From Artists Angle Blanchard Gummo approached the play from the artist's angle. He felt the pink sets in act one were a little too gaudy, and entirely too stylized. The house in the original play went back to the time of Francis the First, and Mr. Gummo felt that the house was entirely too sparse, and not clut tered enough for a house of that age. 'Borish' Prince Dick Larson's design and execution of the sets was lauded by Mary John son. Some of the sets, however could have been changed. The fireplace looked like a waste-basket in her opinion, and again, the Prince looked too 'little boyish' for his role of a weary, love-sick, individual living in a world of fantasy. The hunting scene was too dark, she believed, and it was too dark to shoot an eagle, let alone a owl. 'I liked it, and admired the entire attempt . . .' was Harvey Power's comment on the production. Willard Smith was equally enthusi astic about the play, and felt that the play was lyric, and should have been more so. He liked Billipp as the Inn keeper, and felt that he was superb. Dr. Smith felt the first set was startling and interesting, but not in keeping with the theme of the play."

Three Speakers Bob LeCates introduced the senior speakers, Bud Bush, Lynn Ruth, and Jack Maeby. They were chosen as representing three possibilities tof what students can *do after college. Miss Ruth is getting married; Mr. Bush is going on to graduate school; and Mr. Maeby is entering the busi ness field. They spoke on these dif ferent types of post-graduate plans, under the title, ""What's The Use?"" Bush To Grad School Bud Bush, stated that the main function of a university is to provide an education, and this is best acquired through the curricular and academic activities of the university. Good grades and transcripts are necessary for those wishing to enter graduate school. Moreover, in graduate school we must prove ourselves again and again, and cannot depend on past honors. He went on to say that only if we have acquired the ability to think logically and clearly and to express ourselves in the same way can we say we have been educated. The measure of the value of an education is whether we can use the knowledge we have acquired. We put too much stress on extra-curricular activities; instead we should know our limita tions and act accordingly. He said that a more genuine interest on the part of the faculty might help to cor rect these attitudes. Ruth To Marriage Lynn Ruth, spoke on how college can help to prepare us for marriage. She said the give and take which we must practice in our dorms and rela tionships with our friends can also help to prepare us for the 50-50 atti tude which a good marriage requires. Common interests too, are an impor tant part of every marriage, and col lege offers a wide variety of interests for us to choose from. Moreover, it teaches us how to keep our minds active and interesting so that our fu ture lives will not fall into intellectual ruts, so deadening to a life together. In conclusion Miss Ruth stated that college provides many advantages for our different aims. ""The first step should be to accomplish the univers ity's purpose in teaching us to think critically. From then on we're on our own in gathering other advant ages, and upon the use of our training here depends the kind of people we will become, the kind of marriage we will have, the quality of job we do, and our place in the community,"" Maeby To Work Jack Maeby, raised the question as to what value is a college education to the student who plans to immedi ately enter the business field or a trade after his four years.

Lanemen Co-Champions In MA Tourney; Finish On Road,
Orange And Blue Held,
To 4-4 Deadlock By LaSalle,"by Ellwood Rowe Gunning for their second straight MAC title, the charges of Coach Bill Lane had to be content to reign for a year as co-champions of the conference after battling LaSalle College to a 4-4 stalemate on Steel Field in Bethlehem last Friday in a tilt halted at the end of eight innings on account of darkness. The Bisons entered the finals of the' ------------------------------ - -- playoff championship by virtue of ^ C o u ,, e  M a r k ;"
Divotmen Drop Match,
To State College 8-1,"a bye after the Swarthmore College nine declined an invitation to partici pate in the playoffs, just as they had done in several previous occasions. The LaSalle Explorers qualified for the finals by eliminating the Lehigh University Engineers, who were hosts for the proceedings, earlier in the day by a 7-5 score. First Inning Blast Dick Roush did much to help keep the Herd in the throne room for an other year by holding the Explorers to seven scattered hits while striking out eight and giving up only one base on balls. The first stanza was the only one in which the Bill Haeffner tutored nine gave him any serious trouble. Murdock singled to start the game. Rodden was safe on a fielder's choice as Murdock was forced at second. Joe Gallagher, Explorer centerfielder not to be confused with Joel Gallagher starting moundsman for LaSalle, followed with another fielder's choice. Molmar, rightfielder who slammed out two hits in the game, singled, scoring the first two runs. He tallied the third run later in the inning as Shirk fumbled Tor rence's grounder. The top of the sixth found the Explorers denting the plate for the last time on two singles and a wild pitch. The Orange and Blue tossers coun tered in their half of the initial frame by chasing starting pitcher Joel Gal lagher from the mound before he had retired even one man. Of the three men that he faced, he walked two and the third man singled. McLaughlen relieved in the first with no one out and allowed only six hits and one run the rest of the way. Herd Rallys Diminutive Art Long singled to start the rally and advanced to second on a wild pitch. Shirk followed by drawing a base on balls. Hard work ing Jackie Webber sent Long home on a single with Shirk stopping at third. Powelson flied to center with Shirk checking in the second score of the inning after the catch. Jim Di- Guiseppi was safe on an error. Then Marty "" Stretch"" McKibbin, batting star o f the day, got the first of his three singles, which sent Webber across with the tying run. The Lanemen forged ahead with a ssingle tally in the fifth as Roush opened with a single, advanced to second on Long's sacrifice, and scored on Andy Shirk's single. Powelson drew a free ticket to first, and Di- Guiseppi was hit by a pitched ball which loaded the sacks. Here Mc- A top ranking Penn State golf team gained an 8-1 victory over the Evansmen Tuesday on the University course. Allen Wins In the initial foursome Bison ace Bill Allen, co-captain of the team nicked Joe Durniak 6 and 5. Hud Samson defeated Van Johnson 4 and 3 while the Nittany Lions took best ball 2 and 1. Ben Hoffman and Bill Grim lost to Goldenberg and Bowers with respective scores o f 4 and 2 and 9 and 8. The visitors again won best ball 7 and 6. Long lost to Robertson 5 and 4 and Stark was beaten by Artz 2 up. Buck- nell lost best ball 4 and 3. New Course Record Bowers, number 6 man for the Nit tany Lions, broke the Lewisburg course record set last week by Bill Allen. The visiting golfer carded a 3, three under par and a new course record."
"Face Syracuse, Colgate, And",
Penn State In Season Climax,"by Paul Ganz Bill Lane and his charges have hitched up their pants, picked out their heaviest bats, and settled back to await the toughest section of their 17 game schedule. * The booming bats o f Syracuse, Col- Laughlen escaped serious damage by getting McKibbin to pop to Sottile,! keystone tender. Clutch Push Fails The Lane tutored nine loaded the bases again in the bottom o f the eighth, their final turn at bat before \ darkness set in and halted the con test, but couldn't push across the run that would have meant victory and the undisputed conference champion ship. Once again McLaughlen had it in the clutch as he retired pinch hit ter Willie Keay on a fly ball which | Molmar gathered in for the final out in rightfield. In all, the Bisons left eight men stranded during the game while the Philadelphians left seven men on base. LaSalle entered the game boasting an 11 and 5 record as against our own very fine 8 and 3 won-lost record for the season. The encounter did not get underway until 6:00 p. m. which accounts for the game being called at the end o f eight. The Le- high-LaSalle tussle did not begin until 3:00 which necessitated the late starting time for the second game. - LaSalle ............. 300 001 00-- 4 7 1 Bucknell ........... 300 010 00-- 4"
Netmen Battle Lehigh Today;,

Remmey has won 10 of 13 singles matches this year, with several collegiate stars listed among his victims Bishop is the 1950 Missouri Valley champion and was a finalist in the National In door Junior Championships for 1950. All Vet Lineup Coach Perry Rockafellow, who is starting his 16tb season at Colgate, has an all-veteran squad to put up against the Herd. Leading the seven lettermen will be Capfc. Bill Lust, the number one singles man who pairs with Bishop for the top doubles com bination. Ed Stern and Bob Barker will team to make the second dual match. Barker, a senior, is undefeat ed in collegiate singles this season, having won 11 matches. The final doubles will be Stew Bicknell and' Ted Stanton, both of whom are slated for singles action, or Dick Millar and AI Strickler. Millar was ineligible for competition last season but has been a major factor in compiling the Raiders current 9 won, 2 lost record: The Red Raiders winning team will be the final squad that Hank Peter's green-top courtmen will face this sea son. Remmey is leading the racqueteers in the singles column with 10 wins and 3 losses. Bill Reitz and Skip Hess are in the number two spot with eight victories and five losses to their credit.

Suffer Double Shutout;,
Lose To Cornell Big Red,"by Bill LeMoit The number nine seemed to be dame fortune's gift to the Cornell golf and tennis teams last Wednesday as they scored a brace o f 9-0 victories over the Bisons at Ithaca. Golfers Fade Away * In the golf match the home team took a one sided win as Harold Evans' six charges, Bill Allen, Van Johnson, Russ Long, Ted Stark, Ben Hoffman and Gill Grim tasted defeat on the greens 'far above Cayuga's waters.' Hank Peters'  netmen suffered the second Bucknell loss of the afternoon as one o f the East's top tennis teams knocked off another victim. Sopho more ace Paul Remmey was beaten in three sets by New York district Junior Champion and Junior Davis Cup player Dockerel. It was one of the best matches, of Remmey's career as he extended the Comedian to two and one-half hours of tennis before losing, j Reitz Bows Bill Reitz, playing the number two- position; lost another close match. Rogers, Hess, Mufson and Goff drop ped their matches: In the doubles action Hess and Rog ers, Reitz and Diffendaffer, in their first varsity appearances, lost another close match. The tennis team will face its last two opponents, Lehigh and Colgate on the University courts today and to morrow. The linkmen will meet Le high on the Lewisburg greens Friday."
FOUR NETMEN IN FINAL,"Four seniors, will make tHeir final appearance against Colgate on Fri day. They are Captain Gray Rogers, Bill Reitz, Skip Hess and Dick Larson. Friday's match with Colgate will pit these four men against what Coach Hank Peters rates as the best tennis team in. the East."

Coach Lane i3 hoping that his boys can cop these re maining three tailenders and close the season on a winning note. Orangemen On Friday Syracuse will be the first big test for the Orange and Blue diamondmen. Tomorrow's battle with the Orange will pit such outstanding stickmen as Jim DiGuiseppi, Abe Powelson, and Jackie Webber, all of whom are cur rently hitting over .325, against one of New York State's finer ball clubs. Little is known about the upstate team hut a safe wager will find the going tough against the largest school on the Bison's schedule. Raiders Primed The Herd will invade Hamilton on Saturday to tangle with the Red Raid ers of Colgate University. The Raiders have an improved ball club which recently reached its peak with a thorough trouncing of Army at West Point. Outstanding player on the Raider squad is shortstop "" Nels"" MacCallum who captains Coach Red O'Hara's stickmen. The diminutive warrior batted .337 last year to lead the Indians to a 8-9 season total. The outfield is led by footballers Alan Egler and Karl Kluckohn. The likely choice for mound duty on Saturday will be right hander Clyde Monroe, and handling his slants from behind the plate will be Guy Spader. Last year Colgate edged the Herd 6-4 on the Mathewson Field diamond. A victory for the Bisons on Saturday will cause great elation for the Lane men who will be battling a squad which has downed such Eastern greats as Army, Princeton, Yale, and: Cor nell!. State Final The Nittany Lions will get a- chance to square the season's record against the Herd Tuesday at State College., Bill Lane and Company will be out to make it two in a> row on the season:.

Johnny Brown's Cool Crew,
Found Very Fine By BU Cats,"by Don Raphael Devotees of the cool sounds were really saturated with them last Friday night at the Sig house. The Johnny Brown Jazz Combo blew some rally fine sounds, to the ecstatic delight of those who are a little nauseated with the typi cal hill-billy tripe that seems to come over the air ways these days. The sounds started at nine, and played to a packed house, literally speaking. Couples swayed to the cool, rhythmic beat of the flatted fifths and sevenths that are so well known to the lover o f the cool. Upon approaching the house, sounds rem iniscent of Birdland in New York City, and the 421 Club in Philly float ed sweetly out on the evening air, tickling the approaching cats' sound- starved ears. Singing in unison, the band started off with 'Ool-Yah-Coo', and then pro ceeded to 'go'. Couples either watch ed respectfully as the band blew out the bop side, or took their courage in hand, along with their partners, and ventured out on the floor, to see if they still could get out there and really go, as is done back East, in the 'Land of Ooh-Blah-Dee.' The Jazzmen, eminating from Har risburg, first made their Bucknell debut at the Sig's 'Bowery Brawl,' returning for another frantic session at the SAE's 'Hobo-Hop.' . Contract ed for Houseparty Weekend, the band left with this engagement secured. Throughout the night, the band gave forth with the aforementioned sounds, but what really seemed to be I the extra-special touch were several I Afro-Cubop numbers played. To this 'cat', it seems that the band stacks up to any big-time band cur rently making the circuits around Fhilly or the shore. The members of the band have played in such stellar outfits as Dizzy Gillespie's, Louis Armstrong's, Guy Lombardo's, and other cool aggregations. Later in the evening, as every good cat knew would invariably happen, the band started in on the "" Go, Man, Go"" stage, which, while not the best for dancing, is very fine for listening. As the evening cooly progressed, two very talented Bucknell people stepped up to the stand, and added their tal ents. One was Bev Dunstan, one of the really gone ones, who's voice is a treat to hear. The other person was a real-cool tenor man, name of 'Hoss' DeLoca, who has 'sat-in' with the band on several other occasions. All of which makes one wonder, ' Why Don't We Do This More Often?' by Marijane Watkins"

Prof. Harold Shaffer,". by Bobbie Maurer I'll wager that many of you Bucknellians have never ventured to the third floor of the Engineering Building, except perhaps for art lab. If you do some day, you'll find an-' other large room occupied by busy en gineers under the direction of Harold Shaffer, associate professor of Engi neering Drawing, who has been with ns over 29 years. When asked why he followed the field of engineering, he simply re plied, "" I liked it."" Bom in Lewisburg, he attended the schools here, went on to Bucknell Academy, and followed an AB course in engineering. Graduat ing Summa Cum Laude in 1913, he went on to attain his BS in electrical engineering in 1914, and MS degree in 1924. He did his graduate work both here and at the University of Michigan. It wasn't until 1921 that Professor Shaffer came here to teach. Those eight years between his graduation and 1921--were the only years in which his residence was not in Lewis- bur. It was then that he worked with various companies: Westing- house Electrical Manufacturing Com pany in Pittsburgh, A. C. & F. in Milton, and the Pennsylvania Power and Water Company in Holtwood. Part of Professor Shaffer's spare time is spent in flower-gardening, though his hobbies include collecting stamps and coins. He takes life easy during the summer --  and enjoys swimming. Though he doesn't have much time for reading, he does like the National Geographic and the Reader's Digest. A Sigma Chi, Professor Shaffer is also affiliated with the Masons, the Lions Club, and is a trustee of the Presbyterian Church. A registered professional engineer in Pennsyl vania, he is a member of Tau Beta Pi, engineering honorary, and the American Society o f Engineering Ed ucation. He is also listed in "" Who's Who in Engineering,"" and ""Who's Who in the East."""

This sequel to "" Father of the Bride"" is just as good as the first picture, and perhaps a little better. The title speaks for itself, as to the content of the picture. Friday and Saturday at Sunbury is "" Painted Hills."" It's a Lassie story. Thursday and Friday at the NuWay Drive In on the road to Selinsgrove, is "" Young Man with a Horn"" starring Kirk Douglas, Doris Day, and Lauren Bacall. If. you missed this picture, try and see it.

-- Corner Market St. and Highway 15 --,"9 HUM! #i i i i i u u n i i i ii i i i M i i in n ii u i Here at Bucknell, the dull raiment of the winter is shed, and the new-at- Christmas bucjts are down to the dull gray finish that is the mode for the blase BMOC. "" Accordingly, the cords and seer sucker suits are also being broken out, and with them, fond memories of last summer, the shore, the blasts, the clean-cut living that the college- boy enjoys in the summer. Perennially popular, the button- downs are still here, along with the repp-tie. Flannels are, always in vogue, worn with the cord jacket, argyles, and those former white bucks, now in the spring shade of 'dusty grey.' On the tennis courts, the ""men favor cashmere sweaters, the traditional red-white-and-blue tennis sweater over T-shirts, and shorts. Bucknell Beau Brummel's still haven't accept ed Princeton's Bermuda Walking Shorts, prefering the traditional life guard'style white shorts. The women, needless to say, are lovely as ever. Although we prefer to consider ourselves a men's fashion expert, still we can't help notice those ultra-suave sun-back dresses that the women look oh-so-chic wearing. Many of the sun-back dresses come equipped with shoulder straps, and we can't help stealing the Universitj of Delaware's definition of them. They are worn, U. of D. sagely claims, to keep an attraction from becoming a sensation. And of course,* we have the sun- bather's, but because of obvious limi tations, Bucknell social mores being what they are, we can only surmise the prevalent mode of dress. We would venture to prognosticate that .non Towels will be the rage on '.c roof this season. In the Engineering Departmetn, we v/e the engineers' conscious of the #ason, too. They have changed from ieir usually somber dungarees and ivy-type work-,shirts to GI suntans ad T-shirts. The crew that has been keeping the cal dipsomaniac's havens tunning have changed to spring and summer styles, also. They favor white, ox- fcrd-cloth, button down shirts, that can be left open at the neck, to re lieve excessive body temperatures. Loafers or bucks are popular, as they will stand up under much beating, ike having liquids of various sorts and toxicities spilled on them, et cetera. On SSunday, the local churches see the men decked out in complete cords, with usually a solid color hose, and cordovan's still being very popular as the finishing touch. The women at church are seen in qrgandy, pique, and all the rest of that summery, frilly stuff, but here we'll have to let it go, due to a limit ed knowledge of what the well dress ed woman will wear. We know and I can comprehend shorts, cottons, polo- shirts, but we just can't fight the voluminuous yards of fabrics that the women array themselves in when they step-out. To those who are going to remain for summer-school, we would strong ly advise swimming trunks, beach | apparel and accessories, and, oh, yeah 1 -- you'll need a minimum of study material, too."

"Pastel Decor, Lounge, Books","by Shirley Kistler No, Mabel, I'm not at the Bison, and I do have to break our date. No, I'm not at the B. What! Where am I? I'm at the library."
LIBRARY.,"No, I'm not kidding, the new library is great. It has a nifty phone booth, and it's from there that I'm conducting this discourse with you. Am I Drunk? No, babe, or pete's sake, you know0* I always (it's hard to cross my fingers, arms, and legs in this phone booth) tell the truth. On the level though, this handsome new library is really something--just full of tricky gadgets--like for instance the small doors on the walls-- you just dump the waste paper in there, and the paper goes straight to--the incinera tor. Fancy, No? Fireproof And then, one end of the library's fireproof--wood just won't bum-- ruined a box of matches and two tablets proving it to the boys. What about the other end? I'm afraid that doesn't offer as much safety--I'm holding a charred door in my hands to prove it. As for furniture, those light desks can't be beaten for smart ness. The walls are done in bang-up tones. Very soothing to the eyes and nerves. All pastel shades. Six Levels Of Stacks The facilities for serving students and faculty are better than ever with every modern convenience to make service as efficient as possible. There are literally six levels of stacks but only four are to be occupied this spring. The mezzanines that over look the reading rooms contain one level of stacks each, and they cer tainly add that ultra modem look. What about classrooms? There are some classrooms in the basement which are gained by an outside en trance. Three of the semniar rooms Hepcats, jazzmen, longhairs and squares heard Bruce Mitchell and Stan Purdy discuss ""The Background and Contemporary Significance of American Jazz"" at a program held in the Lit Auditorium at 7 p. m. last night. Mr. Michell discussed the his torical development, and Mr. Purdy told about the present impact and trend of jazz. This meeting was sponsored by the Sociology of Knowl edge Seminar, under the direction of Prof. Richard DuWors. Mitchell, Jazz Collector Bruce Mitchell illustrated t h e various periods of jazz by playing records from his personal collection. A collector of jazz records for the past 25 years, he has one of the most complete jazz collections in the United States. Some of the records he used are ones that he himself recorded. The organizer of the Blue Rhythm Swing Band, Mr. Mitchell is an ar tist, singer, and jazz critic. He is personally acquainted with many famous jazzmen, and is presently writing a book called, ""Jazz at the Crossroads"" . His articles have ap peared on "" Downbeat,"" ""Jazz Tempo"" and "" Second Line'. Stan Purdy, a '48 grad of Bucknell, profit for W. S. G. A. to sell articles at the heir own price and >s are sold to other auction is no: Those v.ishin; auction state then the arti students. The W. S. G.

Books Ate Moved To New Library;,
Carnegie May Be Used For Offices,"__ _____ r* - ________ Last Monday at one o'clock, the old Carnegie library began to empty out, as many students and buildings and ground staff members removed books and loaded them oitto the wait ing trucks to be moved to the new structure. At seven o'clock, with all reference and reserve books transferred, the new Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library was officially opened to the students. Although much of the finishing up opeations is yet undone, the new building will be used from now on. Formal dedication will take place on the weekend of Commencement. When the books were moved, a platform was constructed in front of the library which extended from the door out past the front of the build ing over the front steps and which enabled the men to carry the books right into the trucks. In order to carry the books, many wooden shelves were built which could each be con veniently carried by two men. How ever, since * it would entail too much"

EASTERN RAILROADS,"time and labor to bring the books down from the second floor by hand, a slide was constructed which extend ed from the second floor balcony down through a ground floor window in the west side of the building where a truck was waiting to receive th? books. In order to prevent any books from being misplaced, each shelf or rack of books had a slip with the floor and section it belonged on in the new li brary. When the books arrived at the new library via trucks, they were brought to the correct place by means of this slip of paper and placed on the shelves under the directions of the librarians. The Carnegie building will probably be used for offices for the administra tion. The building was first occupied on September, 19905, and has served ever since as Bucknell's library. The Carnegie building was constructed from an endowment of somewhere be low $50,000 which the university re ceived from Andrew Carnegie, for the express purpose of building a library."

During college, tech niques and methods which are used in business and production are learned, and this enables the graduate to speak in the language of his employ er.

Mr. Maeby also stressed the fact that a college athletic program can have much influence on the student.
