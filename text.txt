After a summer of traffic disruption on Route 15, the underpass con-
necting Bucknell West and the main campus should be completed in
about two weeks.

Route 15 underpass

nears completion

By Steve Hoerter
Staff Writer

The University’s $450,000
underground walkway, intended to
provided safe passage under Route
15 to and from Bucknell West, is
scheduled for completion’ in
approximately two weeks, accord-
ing to Robert Naugle, director of
the physical plant. He said that the
final lane of Route 15 is scheduled
for paving today.

Naugle said that this summer
was a “terrible summer for rain, at
least as far as construction is con-
cerned.” The unusually frequent

rains that plagued the Susquchana
Valley this summer caused numer-
ous delays for campus construction
projects. Paving of the new parking
lot behind Fraternity Row, for
example, was delayed — until
yesterday.

The underpass is the latest in
a series of measures to optimize
safety at the heavily trafficked
intersection at the Route 15
entrance to the campus on Moore
Avenue. “We’ve become  con-
cerned for the safety of students at
this intersection. We have been

Lifestyles cause
town-gown strife

By Michael McGandy
Staff Wniter

Historically the relationship
between Bucknell students, espe-
cially those who live off-campus,
and the residents of the Borough of
Lewisburg has been marked by
tension. On the streets and in the
neighborhoods of Lewisburg, the
differing lifestyles and perceptions
of students and local residents per-
ennially bring them into conflict
over such issues as parties, noise
level, and property maintenance.

“] think there is always going
to be a conflict between student
lifestyles and resident lifestyles,”
said Nada Gray, Lewisburg Bor-
ough Manager. This continuing ten-
sion between students and resi-
dents, though, does have its intense
periods and its lulls. Presently the
University and the Borough of
Lewisburg are attempting to mend
and improve relations after a
stormy month of September last
year.

According to John Dunlop,
dean of student life, the 1989-90
academic year “began with a
bang,” marked by frequent citations
served to Bucknell students for
noise disturbance and a rising voice
of protest amongst local residents.

Yet after that first month, due to
concerted efforts on the part of Uni-
versity and Borough officials, the
“situation improved quickly, appre-
ciably, and stayed that way,” said

Campus prepares implementation
of Sojka’s “social-residential” plan

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Bucknell’s Greek system
faces a major overhaul this year.
On May 12, 1990, the Board of
Trustees approved all but one of
President Sojka’s recommenda-
tions for improving Bucknell’s
Greek system. Throughout this
year, Sojka, with the aid of stu-
dents and faculty, will determine
means for implementing these
recommendations.

Sojka announced his wide-
ranging proposals for the “social-
residential system” at an “Open
Forum” on May 1. Sojka’s recom-
mendations are intended to gener-
ally enhance the “social residential
system,” however, the campus was
most affected by those recommen-
dations specifically concerning the
Greek system.

Under Sojka’s plan, fresh-
men will be able to attend all
“open” fraternity and sorority par.
ties in ‘91-’92. According to Ed
Dadez, Associate Dean of Residen-
tial Life, this year freshmen may
visit fraternity houses or sorority
suites for the first six weeks of
school excluding parties. Last year
freshmen were prohibited from fre-
quenting fraternities and sororities
during the first six weeks. Addi-
tionally, Greek orgai,izations
would be limited to two “closed,”
Or invitation-only, parties a month.

Sojka’s rush proposals also
promise to put a new face on the
Greek system. After this year, only
upperclassmen will be allowed to
rush. Rush will take place in ‘91-
92 during the first ten days of
school or anytime after. Also,
Sojka proposed that every eligible
rushee be guaranteed a bid in some

Greek organization, though not
necessarily the organization of the
rushee’s choice.

Living in fraternity houses,
and to a lesser extent, sorority
suites, will be much different once
Sojka’s proposals are implemented.
All Greek organizations living in
“social-residential” be
responsible for hiring live-in house
managers. Additionally; all stu-
dents wishing to live off-campus
will need written permission from

units will

the university to do so. This
directly affects the ten fraternities
that own their houses — three fra-
ternity houses are owned by the
university, and one fraternity
(Kappa Alpha Psi) does not have a
house yet. Fraternity members will
now have to apply for permission
to live in their own houses. Sojka
has not yet provided a criteria for
who may or may not live off cam-
pus, which has fraternity members
worried that Sojka could use this to

“choke” fraternity houses of live-in
brothers.

These changes are the result
of a long process which involved
all parts of the Bucknell commu-
nity. George Jenks, assistant librar-
ian in charge of collection develop-
ment, moved that the university
“take steps to abolish the Greek
system...” in the first ‘89-90

University charts future
construction projects

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

As students return for the fall
semester, the echoes of hammers
and saws can still be heard across
the campus. The start of the $9.75
million Biology Building construc-
tion project is the largest element in
a flury of construction that includes
the Bison/Bullseye renovation, the
Route 15 underpass, the new uphill
parking lot, the new Bucknell West
intramural fields and the Psychol-
ogy primate lab renovations. When
all of the current activity subsibes,
what will be next on the University
drawing board?

dent for administration, explained
that all major capital improvements

Asbestos delays
Bison renovations

Early November opening slated

By David Murray
Staff Writer

Because of a delay caused by
the discovery of asbestos, the new
Bison, located across from. the
Bookstore in the Elaine Langone
Center, will not open until carly
November. “Because of the exten
sive nature of the construction, the
engineering firm suggested that we
should remove it,” said Mary Dor
sey, acting director of the Langone
Center. “The removal ate up all of
June and most of July,” said Barry
Maxwell, vice president — for
administration.

After the

asbestos was

removed, Hepco Construction
began renovating the space. Hepco,
which just finished renovating the
golf course club house, was the
low bidder on the Bison project.
According to Maxwell, the project
has been budgeted at $778,000, of
which approximately $441,000 will
be spent on construction. The con-
struction figure was “less than what
we anticipated it would be,” said
Maxwell, but the cost of removing
the exceeded those
savings

While the new space is being
finished, the Bison snack bar has
been relocated to the Cave, on the

U.C. gets name, facelift

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

New and returning students
will find the Elaine Langone Center
to be a locus of activity on campus
for some common and other not-so-
common reasons. Sometimes
described as the hub of the Univer-
sity and formerly named the Uni-
versity Center, the newly rededi-
cated Langone Center is typically
the site where incoming students
spend hours upon their arrival to
Bucknell. The Center is also under-
going a major renovation project
which adds to the usual turmoil
found on the ground floor level.

Indeed, despite the name
change, the Langone Center
remains very much the center of the
University for students. Within its

brick walls students purchase their
books, receive their mail, attend
classes, and take their meals. On
the floors of the Center one can
find a comfortable corner in which
to study as well as go to the offices
of Residential Life to work out
some bureaucratic difficulty. The
new Bison and Bullseye being con-
structed on the ground floor will
provide a space for students to eat,
socialize, and recreate that was
hitherto unknown at Bucknell.
Center Renamed

The creation of a new Bison
and Bullseye is the first major pro-
ject undertaken in the Center since
it was renamed to honor: Elaine
Langone, wife of Kenneth Langone
~57. Originally dedicated in 1970,
the Center was rededicated on a

weekend in May when the Univer- °

sity’s board of trustees were con-
vened for their annual spring
meeting.

Beside the placing of Elaine
Langone’s name on the facade of
the Center and her portrait in
Arches Lounge on the third floor,
the biggest change in the actual
functioning of the building relative
to the rededication is that the name
on administrative stationary has
changed. All the staff working in
the Center and the services they
provide have not undergone any
transformation due to the May cere-
mony. The Bison/Bullseye renova-
tion, though certainly altering the
internal shape and character of the
building, had been planned far in
advance of the rededication and

Dunlop.

Indeed, Dunlop is of the
opinion that the whole tenor of
town-student relations is largely
improving. Dunlop cites the coop-
erative effort of town officials,
local landlords, concerned students,
and the University’s administration
as the cause of this positive devel-
opment and increased communica-
tion between parties representing
the Borough and the University on
the Town-Gown Committee.

Student Rentals

Traditionally, a segment of
the student population has lived off
campus in rental units on streets
adjacent to the campus. Leases
passed from student to student for
years creating what amounts to a
student neighborhood comprised of
St. George, St. Catherine, South
7th, and South 6th streets. Accord-
ing to Gray, before even consider-
ing the behavior of student resi-
dents, there are certain patterns
inherent in student rentals which
detract from a residential area.

Primarily there is what she
calls a “cycle of neglect.” Some

landlords who rent to students do
so for two reasons—higher rents
can be asked since students are con-
sidered to be more affluent and less
maintenance can be offered since
Students are less demanding than a
family-oriented resident. Students
themselves, according to Gray, not
only ask less of their landlord in
terms of maintenance, but often
neglect to maintain their residence
since they lack the experience of
having to be responsible for a
home.

The result of this cycle is that
there are neighborhoods in Lewis-
burg which have been poorly main-
tained and the landlord and future
renters cannot be expected to
improve the condition of the unit.

The second negative aspect
of student neighborhoods is that
they are abandoned during school
holidays and breaks. As busy and
vibrant as the South 6th Street
neighborhood may be during the
fall and spring terms, it is desolate

during the summer This sense of a
wansient population is largely not
considered to be conducive to
attracting families and other more
permanent residents to these areas.

Indeed, according to Gray, it
is the goal of the Borough and par-
ticularly the Housing Authority of
Union County to encourage a more
stable residency base in Lewisburg.

“It would be nice to have
more family-owned or owner-
Operator housing in Lewisburg,”
Gray said, “but in moving towards
that we may have already gone as
far as we can go.” Having passed
Borough ordinances stipulating that
no more than three unrelated per-
sons can live in a residence and
calling for stricter property codes,
the Borough had hoped to limit the
expansion of student rentals.

While it is unclear how suc-
cessful these ordinances will be, it
is the case that both this year and
last year, student rentals were not
only found in the South 6th Street
neighborhood, but there were pock-
ets on Market, South Fifth, and
South Fourth streets and on other
blocks of St. Catherine Street.

“IT don’t know how you can
achieve an influx of owner-
operated housing in Lewisburg
with an open market without get-
ting involved in homesteading and
government financing,” Gray said.
The Housing Authority of Union
County is looking at the possibility
of public financing, according to
Gray, but they are not at the Stage
of serious planning.

Increased Conflict

While these issues concern-
ing the demographics of residential
neighborhoods in Lewisburg are of
ongoing importance to town-gown
relations, it is the more Particular
and immediate issues of parties,
noise levels, and public drunken-
ness that aroused the protest of the
Borough community. With refer-
ence to these complaints from the
Borough community, according to
Dunlop, unruly student behavior at,
and traveling to and from parties in
town is the direct cause.

In-town parties at student ren-
tal and students patronizing the bar

are both typical student behaviors
that are to be expected by Borough
residents, and yet the behavior
involved in these activities evoke
an unprecedented negative
response. Considering letters and
opinion articles that appeared in
The Bucknellian during that period
there appeared to be two new fac-
tors which may have exacerbated
the already-existing the conflict
between students and the local
community

The first is that social life on
campus began to change radically
as fraternities began to strictly
enforce University policies against
under-twenty-one drinking and
became less of a focal point for
socializing and drinking. One, per-
haps predictable, result was that
more students, including many
freshmen, went off-campus to
engage in those activities where
they would not be Strictly moni-
tored by campus security forces,
including Residential Assistants
and administrators from the office
of Residential Life.

In addition to an increase in
off-campus parties and the number
of people attending them, the
increasingly spread out locations of
student rentals brought students and
their parties into contact with more
local residents than before.

The result of these two trends
in student social life was that more
Lewisburg residents were affected
by students, often negatively, creat-
ing a larger and more vociferous
body of complaint. The response of
the Borough was to call on the Uni-
versity tO control its students,
accompanied by Chief of Police
Bob Heiter’s vows to arrest any
unruly students in town.

Student Neighbors

Both Gray and Dunlop are of
the opinion that these sorts of stu-
dent-resident conflicts are not
indicative of students in general,
but of a small minority of “prob-
lem” students. Unfortunately,
according to Dunlop, the behavior

of a few students gives a bad repu-
tation to the Bucknell student body
as a whole.

Gray concurred stating that
the relationship between student
renters and their neighbors who are
more permanent residents cannot
be assessed through generalities..“‘It
depends on the behavior of individ-
ual students _in_ individual units,”
she said. Gray herself has had stu-
dent neighbors over the years and
found many to be fine, while others
were quite poor.

What is necessary is commu-
nication between student renters
and their neighbors. It is important,
Gray said, for students and local
residents to “get to know each other

other as problems.” According to

unified in their desire to ease the
conflict and establish a basis for
improved student-resident relations
in the future. The new four-year
residency requirement that accom-
panied a package of recommenda-
tions approved by the trustees relat-
ing to the Greek issue appears to be
an effort on the part of the Univer-
sity to gain more control over what
sort of student lives off campus and
is in close contact with the Lewis-
burg community.

The four-year residency
Fequirement, originally proposed by
President Gary Sojka in the spring,
stipulates that the University can
demand that a student live in cam-
pus housing throughout his or her
time at Bucknell. Students, as a
result, would have to request per-

ission from Residential Life to

ent an apartment or house in
wisburg.

While Sojka has stated that

his mechanism would be used

sparingly to prevent “problem” stu-

“due to the fact that we have such
an understanding student body.” He
is enthusiastic, too, that “a lot of
stuff’s happening in the Bison.”

Food service available in the
new Bison will be greatly expanded
compared to the service formerly
available. Ross said he plans to
send out a proposed menu, “so peo-
ple are aware of what to expect.”
He anticipates take-out pizza and
char-broiled foods, frozen yogurt
and a salad bar.

Additionally, he plans spe-
cialty events like Mexican night
and seafood night. On certain even-
ings, Ross plans a “bistro kind of
menu, with table service” available.

also been suggested in discussions
on campus that this policy might be
a safety net for the University
which may be facing declining
enrollments along with other col-
leges and universities.

Considering the possibility of
empty dormitory beds, the Univer-
Sity could use the four-year resi-
dency requirement to ensure that its
residence halls are filled. At
present, though, the policy is likely
lonly to be used to restrain students
who have been cited for extreme or

hronic cases of misconduct.

Insofar as the four-year resi-
dency requirement, to be instituted
in the next academic year, Gray
said that Borough officials are

leased with the step the University
has taken.

“Tt will make it more of a

plated, “based on student behavior,

Interview

A&S Dean Gerdes prepares |
changes in curriculum

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

“T think that one thing which
is distinct about the position of
dean is that the dean is the one that
makes sure that the day-to-day
issues are dealt with,” said Dean of
Arts and Sciences Eugenia Gerdes,
who was appointed last spring. But
while the office of the dean may
concentrate on the day-to-day
events of Bucknell, Gerdes has
some plans that may significantly
affect the University.

Gerdes, who has been at
Bucknell for fourteen years as a
professor of psychology and two
years as an administrator,
expressed particular interest in reju-
venating an active concern for the
quality of teaching on the part of
the University. More importantly,
though, Gerdes is already partici-
pating in an effort to revise the Uni-
versity’s general education
program.

These “day-to-day” concerns
such as faculty-student ratios,
teaching loads, and residential col-
leges, Gerdes stated, “if taken
together do have a_ significant
impact on the institution and make
it necessary that we step back and
examine our principles.”

Two principles that Gerdes
identified as central to the Bucknell
education were quality teaching
and critical thinking, and she is
undertaking projects to support and
augment both.

“It is very clear that we are
interested in how our faculty
teaches,” Gerdes said. “This is the
place where the dean’s office has to
play a leading role.”

Gerdes cited the “mentor pro-
gram” that was adopted recently by
the faculty which would provide
teaching assistance for the junior
faculty teacher from a_ senior
faculty member outside of his or
her department.

“Tt is okay for a faculty mem-
ber to be looking for ways to
improve their teaching,” Gerdes
said. “It does not amount to a per-
sonal weakness because we were
not taught how to teach.” Gerdes
said that most graduate programs
do very little to develop the teach-
ing talents of its students who are
soon to become professors.

The most important task of
the teacher, according to Gerdes, is
to develop their students’ ability to
think critically. Responding to a
faculty that is disappointed in the
level of critical thinking in the stu-
dent body, Gerdes has undertaken
the task to coordinate a new general
education program for the
University.

“We are saying to the
faculty,” Gerdes commented, “if
you are disappointed with the criti-
cal thinking of your students, help
us develop those skills in students.”

The initial outcome of this
effort is a pilot program of Founda-
tion Seminars that is being offered
this semester for the class of 1994.
These courses are inter-disciplinary
programs which will require that
students approach the topics at
hand from a number of perspec-
tives. Examples of topics are “Zen
and the Arts,” “Learning in an
Information Age,” and ‘“Darwin-
ism: The Lamp and its Shadow.”
The class size is to be capped at
around fifteen students, with the
instructor serving as advisor to
most of the students enrolled in the
class

Gerdes said that the effort
arose out of the desire to institu-

the Greek system is sexist, elitist,
racist, and anti-intellectual. The
motion was tabled until the faculty
received the report from the Greek
Review Comittee (GRC), formed
because of incidentswhich occurred
during 1988-89. The report con-
cluded that Bucknell’s Greek sys-
tem should be retained with minor
changes. But the faculty disagreed
with the report, and they over-
whelmingly approved Jenks’
motion. After a long review pro-

tionally answer the question of
what it means to be educated. “We
have to state more explicity that
students have to see the world from
a variety of perspectives,” Gerdes
said, “not just the ones they came
to Bucknell with.” According to
Gerdes a key component of these
Foundation Seminars will be
addressing issues of race, class, and
gender which can often become
secondary issues amongst Buck-
nell’s relatively homogeneous stu-
dent body.

Explicitly addressing such
issues is part of a larger national
trend within universities respond-
ing both to recognized absences in
their curriculum and an attempt to
use education to combat the ignor-
ance that leads to violence against
minority populations on campus.

Gerdes said that, while the
situation at Bucknell is much less
severe than at other institutions,
“there is an overt sense among
some students of ‘I’m in the major-
ity—my views are right and the
others are wrong.’”

“The issues are there,”
Gerdes stated, “and although Buck-
nell is relatively homogeneous the
world is not that way.”

Beyond this initial year,
Gerdes said that there are tentative
plans to develop a program based
on the principles of the Foundation
Seminars for a larger general edu-
cation program that would replace
the present system of distribution
requirements.

This general outline of the
Foundation Seminars resembles
that of the Freshman Advisory
Seminars and Gerdes noted that
“the Foundation Seminars may not
be too far from their original pur-
pose.” Gerdes said that the Univer-
sity had not provided enough insti-
tutional support for the FAS
program and, as a result, it has not
fulfilled the hopes that people origi-
nally had for it.

A memorandum from the
General Education Committee, of
which Gerdes is a member, detail-
ing the objectives and initial stages
of planning for the Foundation
Seminars was mailed to faculty in
March and has met with a response
that Gerdes called “mixed.” Gerdes
did say that people who were
involved with FAS or the residen-
tial colleges seemed to be more
favorably inclined toward the
program.

Questions have been raised as
to whether the program would be

cess, in which Sojka had to weigh
the views of the student body, the
faculty, and the approximately 800
alumni who wrote to him, Sojka
delivered his recommendations to
the Board of Trustees on May 1.
His proposals elicited a backlash
from the faculty because they did
not feel that the measures taken
properly dealt with the charges of
sexism, elitism, racism, and anti-
intellectualism. They then circu-
lated a petition condemning elitist
organizations on campus. However,
this protest did not significantly

more historically oriented or more
concerned with current affairs and
crises—both approaches have a
body of adherents. There is also the
criticism that the approach sup-
ported by Gerdes strays too far
from a “great-books” conception of
general education.

Gerdes says that she has
already been told by critics that this
plan for creating a general educa-
tion program on the plan of the
Foundation Seminars would repre-
sent anything but —_ general
education.

Looking ahead, as a plan for
the development of the larger gen-
eral education plan out of this pilot
Project, Gerdes expressed what she
called “a very tentative plan” for a
system based on clusters of
courses.

“Instead of taking four
humanities but the University not
taking an interest in which four the
Student takes, there wold be a
theme.” The goal of such a cluster
program would be, according to
Gerdes, “not to go on ina particular
field, but to think and deal with the
world.”

“Right now, with our general
education requirement, we do not
ask that there be any coherence in
the student’s program,” Gerdes
said.

On more general issues con-
cerning her new office Gerdes said
that she understood the position of
the dean to be, primarily, the level
of administration that is directly in
contact with faculty and students
and responsible for mediating the
concerns of these groups.

As a mediator and mutual
representative of the interests of the
administration, the faculty, and the
students it is sometimes difficult to
see how the dean can be an autono-
mous position. Part of being dean,
according to Gerdes, is “keeping
things in line with the thinking of
the people in the higher levels of
administration. The dean’s deci-
sions have to fit into that context.”

Yet there is more to the posi-
tion than mediation. “There is a
delicate balance,” Gerdes added
“in having to be part of a total
administrative picture and dealing
actively with issues. I must be able
to understand the issues from those
three perspective [administration,
faculty, and student] and be seen as
having some integrity of my own.”

Gerdes said that her long
experience at Bucknell as both a
faculty member and an administra
tor have given her the ability to
understand the differing perspec
tives on the issues that concern the
University.

Asked about recent tensions
between the faculty and the admin
istration surrounding
teaching, scholarship, and recent
decisions by the University Review
Committee, Gerdes said, “I per
ceive the situation as somewhat
better than it was a couple of years
ago.”

“Tt might just be a fact of
life,” Gerdes said with reference to
the distance that lies between the
faculty and administration. “When
there are different roles there tends
to be some reservation about pco-
ple in roles other than your own.”

“Differences between people
can be extreme or they can be mini-
mal, but they cannot be completely
removed,” Gerdes stated. She went
on to say that the problems facing
Bucknell were actually part of
larger national trends in higher
education.

Issues of

affect the Trustees’ decision.
Sojka’s recommendations were
reviewed by a special comittee of
five trustees. This committee
approved all of Sojka’s recommen-
dations, except one which would
have required a minimum GPA of
2.5 to rush, as opposed to the 2.0
minimum for participation in all
other campus groups. Finally, the
Board of Trustees adopted all of the
committee’s recommendations
except the 2.5 GPA.

was unrelated to the changing of
the name affixed to the Center.

As far as the new name of the
Center gaining currency amongst
the University community, Asso-
Vice President for Student
Life Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle
said that the process would
undoubtedly take time. In speaking
with upperclassmen, Jacobsen
Weddle found many who state that,
to them, the building would always
be the University Center. Others
have taken to calling the building
the L.C., and some have begun to
refer to the Elaine Langone Center
as the E.L.C. (pronounced elk).

Stating that “the student ver-
nacular comes from its own ori-
gins,” Jacobsen Weddle believes
that students will eventually arrive
at a term which will satisfy their
tastes and eventually gain wide-
spread usage.

What is important, according
to Jacobsen Weddle, is that the
Center continues to serve as the
center of the University. Jacobsen
Weddle referred to the Center as
being “the living room of the Uni-
versity” where students, faculty,
administrators, and staff meet on an

committee is beginning its evalua-

Taylor Hall, the Botany Building
and the Old Bison, all of which will
be vacated when the new science
complex is completed. One propo-
sal suggests relocating the person-
nel department and the career
development center to the Botany
building. Maxwell expects that the
most likely use includes a combina-
tion of administrative staff offices
and classroom space. He did clearly
state that there is no truth to the

very fortunate to this point [that
there have been no accidents],”
Naugle said in a May interview
with The Bucknellian.

University administration,
students, and the engineering firm
constructing the underpass have all
expressed concern about the safety
of persons using the underpass. As
specified in a February memoran-
dum, Barry Maxwell, vice presi-
dent for administration, explained
that several measures are being
taken to insure the safety of stu-
dents. These safety measures
include 24-hour video security
monitoring and “push-to-talk”-type
microphones that will provide
direct contact with Bucknell Secur-
ity. It is the opinion of those
involved in the project that this
combination of security measures
will provide students with a signifi-
cantly safer means of access to and
from Bucknell West.

The construction of the
underpass, though hindered by
inclement weather during the sum-
mer, is on budget and only two
weeks behind schedule, according
to Naugle. He said, “all that’s left is

- the finish work” and that should be

completed in about two weeks.

egalitarian basis over meals and at
meetings.
Part of the Family

Both Elaine and Kenneth
Langone, who were the focus of the
May rededication ceremony for the
Center, recognize Bucknell as
being highly significant in their
lives. As an alumnus Mr. Langone
remained closely associated with
the University and was elected to
the board of trustees and named
chair of national giving in 1981.
Mrs. Langone, according to her
friends and family, shared her hus-
band’s dedication to Bucknell.
Married in 1956, the Langones
lived in an apartment on Market
Suet during Mr. Langone’s senior
year at Bucknell.

“Bucknell University has
been a par’ of our family,” Mrs.
Langone said in May as_ she
acknowledged the gesture Mr. Lan-
gone and the University made in
renaming the Center in her honor.

Beyond offering the Univer-
sity an opportunity to name this
central building something more
colorful than the “University Cen-
ter,” the rededication is important
relative to the University’s endow-
ment. According to University pol-
icy, at least fifty percent of the orig-

building” housing the top adminis-
trators and academic deans.

The new campus landscape
master plan is also expected carly
this semester, according to Max-
well. Included in the report will be
recommendations for on-hill park-
ing and green space. Included in
the report will be recommendations
for the Olin-Dana quad. Plans to
remove the road between the build-
ings and landscape the area have
been discussed. While the master
plan will not specifically address
the issue of dwindling open space
as a campus-wide issue, Maxwell
said, “[The Univeristy community]
is concerned about the loss of green
space, and we share that concern.”

inal cost of a building must be
donated to the University in order
that a building may be dedicated to
an individual. Barry Maxwell, vice
president of administration, put the
cost of the original construction of
the Center somewhere between $4
and $6 million. After the dedication
Maxwell said that the majority of
the donation would be funnelled
into University accounts marked
for undesignated and unrestricted
use. Other portions of Mr. Lan-
gone’s donation were placed into
the Weis Center for the Performing
Arts, the University’s endowment,
and facility funds.
