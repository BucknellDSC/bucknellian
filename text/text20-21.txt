At no time jn the intelleetual de-
velopment of the citizens of our
country has the ‘obligation of the
college and University towards poll-
ties been so great, The guidance of
the Ship of State is in the hands of
men who have tried to sense public
opinion in order to make fair and }
equitable decisions in matters of pub-1
lie policy. This has always been go in
our country and is the secret of the
permanence of the Nation. Puble
opinion is largely generated by the
attitude of men for whom the great
masses of people have sincere admi-
ration and unqualified respect, How
many men who mold pubHe opinion
are products of or are at present Iiv-
ing’ in our great colege communities?

John Erskine.in “The Moral Obli-
gation to the Intelligent'’ would have
those of us who have been trained
at great cost to our familes, our-
selves, or Univerflty Endowments,
return in some measure, the results
of that training to the community in
which we tive—the Nation to whieh
we owe allegiance. This Nation de-
mands of us that we bear arms in
time of war; Why can it not demand
that we use our minds -in time of
peace? There is a vast fund of evi-
denee for and against the League of
Nations, There are many minds
whose mental convolutions are not
affected by evidence nor by the dig-
ging into the propaganda or truth,
(as the ease may be behind if.) Prop-
aganda is not always a whole eoth
of lies, but its orfgin does not be-
speak its sincerity.

It is part of the training of the
College University man to be in a
position to make his decision on the
basis of the facts in the case, What
those facts are can only be found
by a clear analytleal study of the
causes, the oceasions and the events
which have led up to the erisis be-
fore us in the settlement of the
greatest war the world ever engaged
itself in. For what? For aggrandize-
ment, for imagined wrong, for com-
mercial supremacy of a group of
Nations, for reprisal on a war-erazed
foe—no, none of these but for the
purpose of preventing future wars in
this world of ours where men might
live together in peace, in perpetuat-
ing great constrnetive enterprises,
livinv as God wished his children to
live.

Do College Men think? Yes, college
men are capable of thinking. Are
they thinkink in this political erisis
when the world’s seenrity rests on 2
preference in Presidential candidates
in one country? Unless they do, there
is little hope that the rest of the
vast electorate will receive from the
University and College communities
any help, only guidance in making
this Nation’s Great Deeision.

this Fall, in whieh the present mem-
bers of the society, alone, will take
part.

‘PROWANT GIVES
TEAM BLANKETS

Among the thousands of Bucknell
enthusiasts, there has always been
manifested an almost unanimous in-
clination to improve our athletie de-
partment. The attempts to assist have
as a rule tuken the form of advise
and criticism of those in charge. It
is very significant that the volumes
of advise and criticisms, given and
heeded in the past, have effected the
effielency and strength of the Ath-
letic organization very very little.
And consequently, while thoge in
charge appreciate the value of intelli
gent advice and construetive eriti-
eism ,and welcome them, they, do not
value their effectiveness very highly,
and feel very certain that as a gen-
eral rule the only way to really help,
to improve our athleties is by muat-
terial contribution,

Among our friends in Lewtsburg,
there is one mun at least who shares
this view with the authorities ,and
who has always aeted accordingly.
This is John F. Prowant,
known as ‘Johnny on the Corner.”
In the dim past when‘ Bueknell foot-
ball players had to sit and shiver
when not in the play, Johnny was In-
strumental in raising a fund, among
the members of the old Lewisburg
Club, to provide them with blankets,
When funds were needed to secure
the canvas which now encloses our
field, Mr. Prowant was ready with |
his share. In every instance in whiecl
any funds of any kind were solicited
from-him, he was “Johnny on the |
spot,” and several contributions have |
come from him without any solefta-
tion whatever. It was therefore not
at all surprising, although it was a
very pleasant surprise, when just be-
fore the game last Saturday, a set of
eleven new foot hall blankets were
presented to the Athletic AssocStion,
with the compliments of John F.
Prowant and Son. /

It is a great pleasure to acknow-
ledge this gift and to express, thro
these columns, the heartlest appre-
ciation of Mr. Prowant's thoughtful-
ness and Hberality in furnishing this
mueh needed equipment, And in this
grationus acknowledgement we are
sure that we are voleing the senti-
ment of the entire student body, the
{faculty and the alumni.

“CHIC” FLORIN INTRODUCES
SOME NEW YELLS AND ASKS
FOR BETTER SUPPORT

Cheering practiee last week on the
Athletic field developed several per-
tinent points concerning that fmpor-
tant phase of all the games: namely,
cheering our teams on to victory.
Cheer leader Florin reallzcs this ne-
eessity and consequently has devel-
oped several new yeils and is working
on some more which he hopes will
urge Orange and Blue gladiators on
to greater dceds. However, yell
galore are of no avail unless properly
execuied and they can only be put
over when the student body stands
behind the cheer-lJeaders at practice
and at the games. Florin makes a | m:
plea for greater interest and better | ni
attendance at cheer practice by the
entire student body.

speaking very earnestly on the need

for the establishment in all cities of ,

municipal legal ald bureaus such as
he has recently established in Phila-
delphia of which we elsewhere glve
an account.

He sald in part, as reported by the
Philadelphia Public Ledger, “The
duty of the municipality to conduet a
legal ald bureau is just as much u
civic duty as cleaning streets and
pproviding water. A bureau to Inves-
tigate and defend impositions upon
the poor and ignorant, and to furnish
a proper and ratlenal defense for men

is just as much an obligation as to fill
the office of district attorney for the
prosecution of crimes, or to provide a
elty solicitor to enforce health man-
dates and building restrictions,”

Mr. Tustin's appeal was seconded
by Charles I. Huges, who declared
“The legal aid society is the poor
man's lawyer and gives him the es-
sential assistance he cannot obtain
elsewhere.

curriculum of Columbia University
in New York City. The course is a
part of the Department of Engllsh
and was tried ont this summer with
signal success—so go the reports re-
eelved.

The course in the writing and

under Mr. Patterson, take up the
motion pteture from on entirely dif
ferent angle.

“Wei are going to try
those students who show talent the
actual technical points connected
with the writing of photoplays,” sala
Mr. Patterson. ‘We have our labora-
tories for this right jn the motion

own classrooms, where from time to
time we show current films and at-
tempt to analyze them from all point
that could be of interest to writer
for the screen, This will inelude all of
the camera tricks and devices. The
student must have a pretty fair know

the camera, and use of the close-up,

BOWSER

‘(From Page One)
P. Reynolds saw his possibilities and
held him out of several important
games, and then put him jn on the
Hne in order to arouse him to his
greatest effort.

He stands todny as one of the
greatest fullbacks In the
He has been the outstanding indi-
vidual performer jn every game this
year,

“Bowser 1s an all-round football
player. His ability is not confined
to particular phases of the game, Ile
performs equally well as a kicker,
line-plunger, open-field runner, for-
ward passer and defensive man. His |
Hne plunging and open-field run-
ning are very spectacular. Seven of
his eight tonchdowns against Ur-
sinus and Muhlenburg were made by
straight line plunges, within their
10-yard lines, where the defense 1s
always the stiffest. The elghth was
made on a crossed signal, When he
found. himself in possession of the
ball, with no one to receive it from
him, and no interference, he dug out
for himelf, and unaided, tore thru
the entlre Muhlenburg team, shak-
ing off n half dozen tacklers and car-
rying the ball fifty-five yards to the
goal Hne.

Wis kicking ability allows oppo-
nents scant reason for any feeling of
seenrity. He sends kickoffs high into
the air and rarely drops them short
of the goal line, Wis punts re
usually forty-five or fifty yards, and
kicks the ball high enough to allow |
the ends ample time to get down the
field and dep the recelver in hts
tracks. His ability to accurately di-
rect placement ‘kleks between the

ARMISTICE DAY

From Page One

man,” “BUI” Irvin’ was the first te
reuch the neutral stage, followed
clesely by “Soup" Davis and Frank
Yownzend, Others gradually fell by
the wayside until “Red” Jones and
“Al” Mahoney were the only surviv-
ors. Lack of time and a surplus of
clothes prevented a fight to the fin-
ish. “Soup”? Davis’ Phi Gam adher-
ants rushed ta his ald with a bath-
robe, and the day was saved.

On the whole, the evening was the
best thing in the history of the col-
lege for the promotion of better fra-
ternity splrit, and may be added to
the already long Ust of events which
prove that Armistice Day was a com-
plete suecess,

Following the parade from the
Tustin Gyninasiuni consposed of the
Bucknell Band, students and cavalry
troops, a fltting celebration of Armis-
tice Day was held in the Baptist
Church at 10 o’elock in the morning.
A large crowd turned out to pay tri-
bute to the boys who so gallantly
served their country during the late
war.

President ‘'Diek'’ Mason of the

Senior Class was the presiding officer
of the meeting. The opening prayer
was made hy Rey. Peaeock, followed
by the singing of ‘America’ by the
audience,
, Dr. Hunt made the first address,
taking as his theme “What does
Arnilstice Day Really Mean.’ He said
{n part:

“We would all Hke to understand
the heart and the meaning of Armis-
tice Day. No one of us Knows how
much Armistice Day ought to mean
to us. Who knows what would have
been the situation if Armistice Day
had not come? If autocracy and mill-
tarism had conquered, what then?
Who of us can tell; but we can mere-
ly raise the qnestion, do something to
open our minds to the significance of
this great day.

What does it mean to everyone of
our men who were over there? No
one of us who was not over there can
pieture the feelings of the men
when they thought, ‘‘shall I ever see
the Statute of Liberty again; shall ¥
ever see the good old United States
again?’ And the morning of Novem-
ber 11th, two “years ago everyone of
our men over there felt that these
questions were answered far him, Be
fore that, every morning the questlon
was, what may happen to-day; to-day
may settle 1¢. The morning of Nov

we are not Guite so ¢ vuln that the:
are worth fighting for as we were b
fore. That means that we lost ground
to regain and nothing excep
loyaltgy to the truth will open th:
way for us into larger and higher
truth. That is just as true of the na-
tion

About twq generations ago an A-
n admiral cast anchor in the
harbor at Japan, He wsn’t invited. He
had distinct notice that this nation
was quite willing to remaln a hermit
nation, but the American represen-
tative was not willing that they
should and he had a heavier gun to
support hls point of view. That na-
tion which did not care to enter into
a treaty with any other natlon on
earth was induced, practically forced
to make a treaty, with the positive
would have equul treatment with th
most favored nations with which A
merica was then in treaty, When Cal
{fornia got Ured of the Chinese and
excluded them, they went to Japan
te kk labor, Then the state of Call-
tornia began to take the same atti-
ture toward the Japanese They
worked too hard and were too frugal
and saved their money too fa
There were 50,000 Japs in Califor
nla. They seemed to be afraid that
would swamp the state, The;
made so much fuss that the Japane
voluntarily stopped the Imm igration

absolute

meric

from Japan. Six months ago they stop |
which prevailed of |

ped the practice
permitting Japanese young women to
eome over to this country to be mar

d.

Lastly, a blank fact Is that at.th
recent election the people of Cali
fornla, by a very large majority,
voted to ‘refuse the ordinary rights of
itizens, of residents even, to Japa-
nese In California. Even the native-
born Ameriean children of these Jap-
enese shall not be permitted to hold

land in the state of Californian. This |
free country that’s the melting pot
of the nation with the equal right
and opportunity for All, I confess to
you I hang my head in’ shame, If
we're golng back on that policy, that
Frinciple, more than n policy, which
has been Amerlean, and resort to the
pelty, selfish method of living in this
world, we're laying up for ourselves
wrath against the day of wrath, anc
that nation, relatively inexperienced
in the international affairs, is en-
titled to the highest admiration for
the self-control, the peace, the dig-
nity, with which they have endured
the bulleying of this blg neighbor
next to them, across the Paclfie. Let
us advise our people of just what is
golng on se there may be no {gnor-
anec. Shall it be thtat these stgnifi-
eant, epoch-making years shall be
filled with such memories? If so,
we'll be worse of than we were be-
fore.”

At this point Mr. Grover Short
rendered a very beautiful vocal solo
which was much appreciated.

It was a disappointment that Ma-
jor General Clements was unable to
be present at the serlvce, but his
place was more than ably filled by
Dr. Harris, who said in part:

“We are eelebrating to-day the
second anniversary of the close of the
great war, a day of the greater re-
jolcing to all the nations of the
world. We will inquire first into the
cause of the great struggle and then
Into our own America’s part in it and
then to some results tiiat flowed out
from it.

Now it so hapened that in Central
Europe there was a people who had
been divided up into a large number
of independent pollifeal uniis. At one
time there were as many as three
hundred. There were four kingdoms
and some five or six duchies, four or
five dukedoms, some free citizens and
the imperia) provinee of Alsace Lor-
rane, A great man set himself to
uniting Germany. He would combine
in one great structure in Central
Ewrope; divine rights of kings, sov-
ereignty of the house of Hohenzoll-
ern. They shall have universal suf-
frage every man over twenty-five

The last meeting of the Mechanical
Engineering club students was one
of the best in the history of the or-
ganization. Professor Burpee had
charge of the meeting, and the at-
tendance of the Electrical Engineers’
Society swelled the attendance, Tho
organizations were addressed by Mr.
N. G. Reinicker, who is, at present,
the superintendent of operations of
the Pennsylvania Power and Light
Company at Allentown. He spoke of
power stations in general and then
touched upon and explained ‘Super-
power" systems and stations, Ile
spoke more in detail! of the steam
boiler operation end of the game and
explained the details of the 2500 h.
p. boiler located in the Detroit Kdi-
eon Company's plant in Detroit with
whom he was employed during their
construction, These are the largest
and most powerful of their kind in
the world. ‘

traveler and explorer who h sureh-
ed out all the “dark corners of the

ed parts further inland and finally
the regions of the very primitive peo

Eternal Twilight.

Iie spoke at length concerning the
Pigmies who dwell in this

are the most jovial of all the peoples
of the earth and also the most dan-

as even the whites of Europe and

America can boast. Dr.-Gell claimed | *

that the problem of civilizing Africa
will be solved when these people are
given a written language and a liter |

the continent.
The lecture cont{nued for an hour

This trip is part of the yearly pro-
gram of the Musical Clubs, which en-
deavor to bring Bucknell University
before the cyes of the public. Football
and other sports do this in large mea-
sure, but not completely, for there
is a considerable percentage of the
public which does not rate a college
acocrding to its sports but in propor-
tion with its musical and Hterary
ability. Both sports and music are in-
dispensible in this effort of advertis-
ling Bucknell, but they must work
‘hand {n hand to secure the best im-
\prdeation. With one absent, the public
[get an idea of a school poorly-bal-
anced.

In addition to advertising Bucknell
in this manner, the members of the
club will be on the outlook for good
matertal for future Freshman classes
for the university. This ts one of the
‘best works of the Musica! Clubs for
Rucknell when on trips.

The repertoire of the club has been
increased by several new songs thi:
year, and these will be used in giving
the club as a whole more appearance
on the platform. Requests that the
entire elnb apepar more often dur-
ing the course of the program, than
has been the custom have meen made
from nearly every town in which con-
certs have been given.

The solo work on the trip will be
taken care of by Ralph Hartz,
“Boby" Hartz. Don Cloward,a nd
Hobart Brown. All of these men are
sufficiently well known to dispel any
doubt as to their ability. And last,

IN SEASON’S FINAL BATTLE

Bowser Individual Star In Battle
Between Rival Teams On Wet Field

Carlisle Collegians Put Up

Hard Fight But Weight of |

Orange and Blue Is Win-
ning Factor

Wiliansport had its first taste of
college football sinee the days when
State college and the Carlisle Indian
staged thelr battles on the Seminary
athletic field, when
Dickinson lined up on the High
school athletic field Thanksglving
day. Bucknell won by a score of 20 to
6. The field was wet and that part
used as a baseball diamond was
muddy when the game started, Be-
fore the end of the first quarter both
teams looked like painted Indians,
mud from head to foot, not forgetting
thelr faces.

Captain Joe Kostes played his last
game for the university, and made
it a good one. “Tommy” Mangan
was out of the game because of an
injury to his leg received the night
before in practice, but hls position
as quarterback was ably taken by
Dayhoff, who ran the team very well.
MeDermott, the fighting end, was
also missed on the line, although
Steve Wargo filled the gap in his
best manner. Bowser, however, was
the real star of the game, and there
might have been a different story
told, had it not been for his plunges,
runs and long distance kicks.

The playing of the team on the
whole, however, was not up to the
standard set in the games with Penn,
Navy, Lafayette and Gettysburg, and
the wet wield mussed things up still
more, Added to this,
fought hard for every inch of ground
and although  eonsiderably — out-
weighed, put up a wonderful defen-
sive game. Some newspaper crities
went so far as to say that Bucknell
was outplayed in the first and fourth
quarters,

Bucknell‘ had by far the heavier
team, its Hne averaging twenty-three
pounds to the man and its backfield
twenty-eight pounds to the man
heavier than Dickinson, On a wet
field this gave them a decided ad-
vantage and they used it in battering
the Dickinson line for  eonsistent
gains.

The audience was enthusiastic and
impartial, It cheered both teams alike
the one making the play that met ap-
proval getting that approval loudly,

The ball quickly became so wet as
to almost prohibit open play. Buek-
nell tried nine forward passes, four
of wihch were completed and netted
47 yards, one was intercepted and
four grounded, Dickinson tried four
forward passes, only one of whieh
made good and that for seven yards.
One was intereepted and two ground-
ed.

Bucknell seored eleven first downs
and Dickson five, In 67 rushes Buck-
nell carried the ball 137 yards, while
Diekinson, in 33 rushes carried it 113
yards,

Bucknell punted six times. Two of |

these were blocked, once Dickinson
falling on the ball. The remaining
four tries aggregated 160 yards,
three of them golng out of bounds
and one being run back 15 yards.
Diekinson punted six times for 201
yards, All went out of bounds but
one, and it was a run back of ten
yards.

Bucknell was penalized six tlmese
for a total of 80 yards, the most seri-
ous being 30 yards, half the distance
to the goal line, when Reed was put
out of the game. Dickinson was pen-
alized twice, a total of 20 yards.

OVER FORTY CANDIDATES

At first basketball practice, over

ALUMNI MONTHLY
APPEARS AGAIN

OFFICIAL PUBLICATION FOR
BUCKNELL GRADUATES COMES
OUT IN SECOND ISSUE OF YEAR

The second number ef the present
years’ volume of the Bucknell Alumni
Monthly has made it appearance.
The paper is in its entirety an exeell
ent sheet for one of its type and pur-
pose. Its status among the publiea-
tions of the college has never been
questioned but the showing that it is
making this year will go far towards
ralsing it a number of notches in the
estimation of both alumni and under.
grads.

Prof. L. lL. Rockwell, ‘07, is the
editor of the Monthly, and it is due
largely to his efforts that the edl-
torial portion of the paper is at its
present high stage of development
Prof. 11. S. Everett, ‘12, is the busi
{ness manager, and is making hls de-
partment perform its work eredit
ably.

What is easily the feature of the
jissue is a eut of the football varsity
of 1895, the eut occupying the posi
tion of honor on the first page. In a
brief explanation below ar ven the
names of the members of the team,
together with information cencern-
ing their present positions. There are
no records of two of the men. One
face famlliar to all Bueknellians of
the present day is that of B. F.
Thomas, registrar.

Under the head of editorials is one
whieh asks the question: “What is an
Alumnus?" After asking the question
the writer goes on and answers it in
a clever way, ending up, however,
with an appeal for all those who have
fallen under the definition to become
members of the Alumni Association
| immediately. ,

The various football games which
had been played between the issuing
)o fthe first and second numbers of
the paper, are treated fully. In every
jinstance, the lineup for the game is
|given, thus adding much to the in-
terest of the writeup.

Two interesting departments are
the “Alumni Organizations” and the
“In the Public Eye.’’ The former
gives news of the affairs of the
Bucknell alumni association, and of
the various loeal Bucknell alumni as-
sociatiens throughout the state and
country. The latter devotes its space
to printing interesting facts eoncern-
ing graduates who have made good,
or who are in the process of making
good,

Seven columns of space are devoted
to personals, the arrangement of
these being made according to classes
The earliest class repreented is that
of 1876. Instead of including the last
class, 1920, in’ this list, a special
page is set aside for a resume of, the
activitic
jatfer graduation.

i On the pge headed ‘About the
Hil," is a brief summary of the most
j/important events oecurring at that

udergraduates being published in the

lance of Neing Earnest”, as its first
; Production of the year, in the Or

David H. Stewardson, the manage

The play {s a comedy in three act
hy Osear Wilde, The plot is, briefly
as follows—Mr. John Worthing, a
young Icnglishman, Hves in the coun
try with his ward, Miss Cecily Car-
dew, a sweet young girl. In order to
set to town, he has pretended to have
t inger brother, by the name oi
Earnest, who lives in town, and is
always getting into scrapes. Jack’.
friend, Algernon Montcrieff, whe
lives in town, has invented a perman-
Jent invalid, called Bunbury, whom he
must visit often, thus enabling him
to get to the country.

Jack becomes engaged to Algy’s
}cousin Gwendoline Fairfax under the
name of Ernest. This provokes Lady
| Braknell, Gwendolines mother, who
j considers an engagement by Gwen-
doline a matter to be promoted and
managed by her.

Algy makes a surprise’ visit to
Jack's place in the cbuntry and
meets Jack's ward Cecily, who be-
lieves him to be Jack’s reckless bro-
ther, Ernest. Meanwhile Jack having
determined to get rid of his pretend-
ed brother, Ernest has returned to
his country home with an explana-
tion of his brother’s death. This he
relates to Miss Prism, Ceeily’s tutor
and Dr! Chausable, the rector. Cecily
then appears and informs Jack of his
brother Ernests’ presence in the
country, whereupon Algy appears,
much to Jack’s dlseomfort. Jack
feigns a reconciliation with his reek-
less brother. While Jack is arranging
to have Algy sent away from the
country, Algy again meets Cecily
and they become engaged, she think-
{ing him Ernest. Gwendoline then ar-
' tives, Cecily stili thinking that Algy
is Jack's younger brother, Ernest, in-
forms Gwendolin that Ernest has an
elder brother who is her guardian
and also that she, Cecily, is engaged
to Ernest. Gwendolin informs Cecily
that she is engaged to Ernest Worth-
ing. This disclosure causes a quarrel.
At this stage the play has reached its
| climax and the author works the
|plot out Im a most clever and fitter-
esting manner.

Ross Kauffman Gixes Orange And

Blue Football Heroes Positions On |

His Mythical Elevens With Other
Stars.

Ross Kauffman, special sport
writer of the Philadelphia North
Americun, gives Arda Bowser, the
powerful bullfack of the Orange and
Blue place as fullback on his All-
Kastern team, and mentions Bowser
for fullback and McDermott for right
end on his All-Pennsylvania team.
Kauffman is one of the best known,
and most reliable sporting writers In
the United States, and the fact that
he has seleeted Bowser and MeDer-
mott for these positions of honor
shows that these men are really
worthy of note, His speeial article in
yesterday’s North Ameriean tould
be given careful attention by all
lovers of the great autumn sport. The
aet that two Bueknell players have

been so signally honored also goes toi

prove that the past football season

as really a sueeess, It means a lot
to the institution toe have the. names
of Bucknell players linked with those
of the stars from sueh universities
au Prineeton, Pittsburgh, Penn
State, Syracuse, Yale, Harvard and
Dartmouth. A portion of the special
article in yesterday's North Amerl-
can 1s ineluded below:

‘Backfleld material far surpassed
linemen in brillianee this season and

it would seem extremely difficult to}

plek out the quartet on the first All-
Eastern team, but there are four men
who stand out stronger than the rest
and naturally should be given the pre
ference,

Don Lourie, of Prineeton, gets our
eall at quarterback; Tom Davies, of
Pitt, and Freneh, of the Army at
halfback ,and Bowser, Bucknell, full-
back.

Bowser is not as well press-agented
as the other three. In faet, his ex-
ploits are not very well known out-
side this state, but the brand of foot-
ball that he played all year stamps
him as one of the greatest fullbacks
in the entire United States of Amer-
ica.

Playing on a Big Three team or
other big eleven. Bowser would have
been the most diseussed player in the
easl. This big boy, who weighs 190
pounds, scored 113 of Bucknell's 245
points, One hundred and_ four of
these points were made on _ touch-
downs and nine on long field goal,

respectively.

Jowser started his sensational play
Ing on Frankliln FPleld against Penn
and followed it up with an even
greater game at Annapolis, Coach
Folwellt and his assistants deciared in
mid-season that the Bueknell  full-
back was the best all-around back
seen on the Navy field in years. He
was extremely hard to stop, belng a

|Petition With Signatures of
Almost Every Student Is
To Come Before Senior
Council Tonight

A petition is being circulated
around the "Hill" and at the differ4
ent fraternity houses today to secure
an additional five days vaaetion at
Christmas time. A similar petition
was unanimously slgned by the “Sem-
J ites and the two will be presented

jointly to Senior Council at its reg-
{ular meeting this evening, with the
| idea of having that body take action
jon the plan with the faculty, The
polnis set forth in the petition are
indeed excellent ones, and should re-=
ceive the fullest consideration, Pere
haps the strongest argument in favor
of the extended vaention is the fact
that a great majority of the students
need the extra days for work at home
during the Christmas rush, the fi«
nancial outcome of which will en-
able them to return to school for the
second semester,

The student

tition believ

who arranged the pe-
that the five extra days
could be granted by the faculty with-
out resulting in too much less of
time to the student body as a whole,
as Monday, December 20th and the
nerning of Wednesday, December
22nd, being the only days in which
could held, with the pos-

ible exception of the few seattered

classes held Saturday morning. From
the general titude of the student
body already expressed, it is believed
that the petition will be ned u
ously The petition itself follow
PETITION
In vic of the faet that Senior
Couneil ts the official representative
of the Bucknell student body, we
indersigned, present this petition te
senior Council to have proper action

others of similar high standing are

WHEREAS, these first class eol-
leges also begin later in the fall, have
a week between semesters, and elose
