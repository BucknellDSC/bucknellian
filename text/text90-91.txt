After a summer of traffic disruption on Route 15, the underpass con-
necting Bucknell West and the main campus should be completed in
about two weeks.

Route 15 underpass

nears completion

By Steve Hoerter
Staff Writer

The University’s $450,000
underground walkway, intended to
provided safe passage under Route
15 to and from Bucknell West, is
scheduled for completion’ in
approximately two weeks, accord-
ing to Robert Naugle, director of
the physical plant. He said that the
final lane of Route 15 is scheduled
for paving today.

Naugle said that this summer
was a “terrible summer for rain, at
least as far as construction is con-
cerned.” The unusually frequent

rains that plagued the Susquchana
Valley this summer caused numer-
ous delays for campus construction
projects. Paving of the new parking
lot behind Fraternity Row, for
example, was delayed — until
yesterday.

The underpass is the latest in
a series of measures to optimize
safety at the heavily trafficked
intersection at the Route 15
entrance to the campus on Moore
Avenue. “We’ve become  con-
cerned for the safety of students at
this intersection. We have been

Lifestyles cause
town-gown strife

By Michael McGandy
Staff Wniter

Historically the relationship
between Bucknell students, espe-
cially those who live off-campus,
and the residents of the Borough of
Lewisburg has been marked by
tension. On the streets and in the
neighborhoods of Lewisburg, the
differing lifestyles and perceptions
of students and local residents per-
ennially bring them into conflict
over such issues as parties, noise
level, and property maintenance.

“] think there is always going
to be a conflict between student
lifestyles and resident lifestyles,”
said Nada Gray, Lewisburg Bor-
ough Manager. This continuing ten-
sion between students and resi-
dents, though, does have its intense
periods and its lulls. Presently the
University and the Borough of
Lewisburg are attempting to mend
and improve relations after a
stormy month of September last
year.

According to John Dunlop,
dean of student life, the 1989-90
academic year “began with a
bang,” marked by frequent citations
served to Bucknell students for
noise disturbance and a rising voice
of protest amongst local residents.

Yet after that first month, due to
concerted efforts on the part of Uni-
versity and Borough officials, the
“situation improved quickly, appre-
ciably, and stayed that way,” said

Campus prepares implementation
of Sojka’s “social-residential” plan

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Bucknell’s Greek system
faces a major overhaul this year.
On May 12, 1990, the Board of
Trustees approved all but one of
President Sojka’s recommenda-
tions for improving Bucknell’s
Greek system. Throughout this
year, Sojka, with the aid of stu-
dents and faculty, will determine
means for implementing these
recommendations.

Sojka announced his wide-
ranging proposals for the “social-
residential system” at an “Open
Forum” on May 1. Sojka’s recom-
mendations are intended to gener-
ally enhance the “social residential
system,” however, the campus was
most affected by those recommen-
dations specifically concerning the
Greek system.

Under Sojka’s plan, fresh-
men will be able to attend all
“open” fraternity and sorority par.
ties in ‘91-’92. According to Ed
Dadez, Associate Dean of Residen-
tial Life, this year freshmen may
visit fraternity houses or sorority
suites for the first six weeks of
school excluding parties. Last year
freshmen were prohibited from fre-
quenting fraternities and sororities
during the first six weeks. Addi-
tionally, Greek orgai,izations
would be limited to two “closed,”
Or invitation-only, parties a month.

Sojka’s rush proposals also
promise to put a new face on the
Greek system. After this year, only
upperclassmen will be allowed to
rush. Rush will take place in ‘91-
92 during the first ten days of
school or anytime after. Also,
Sojka proposed that every eligible
rushee be guaranteed a bid in some

Greek organization, though not
necessarily the organization of the
rushee’s choice.

Living in fraternity houses,
and to a lesser extent, sorority
suites, will be much different once
Sojka’s proposals are implemented.
All Greek organizations living in
“social-residential” be
responsible for hiring live-in house
managers. Additionally; all stu-
dents wishing to live off-campus
will need written permission from

units will

the university to do so. This
directly affects the ten fraternities
that own their houses — three fra-
ternity houses are owned by the
university, and one fraternity
(Kappa Alpha Psi) does not have a
house yet. Fraternity members will
now have to apply for permission
to live in their own houses. Sojka
has not yet provided a criteria for
who may or may not live off cam-
pus, which has fraternity members
worried that Sojka could use this to

“choke” fraternity houses of live-in
brothers.

These changes are the result
of a long process which involved
all parts of the Bucknell commu-
nity. George Jenks, assistant librar-
ian in charge of collection develop-
ment, moved that the university
“take steps to abolish the Greek
system...” in the first ‘89-90

University charts future
construction projects

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

As students return for the fall
semester, the echoes of hammers
and saws can still be heard across
the campus. The start of the $9.75
million Biology Building construc-
tion project is the largest element in
a flury of construction that includes
the Bison/Bullseye renovation, the
Route 15 underpass, the new uphill
parking lot, the new Bucknell West
intramural fields and the Psychol-
ogy primate lab renovations. When
all of the current activity subsibes,
what will be next on the University
drawing board?

Barry Maxwell, presi-
dent for administration, explained
that all major capital improvements

all construction requests on a yearly
basis, assigning them to one of

Asbestos delays
Bison renovations

Early November opening slated

By David Murray
Staff Writer

Because of a delay caused by
the discovery of asbestos, the new
Bison, located across from. the
Bookstore in the Elaine Langone
Center, will not open until carly
November. “Because of the exten
sive nature of the construction, the
engineering firm suggested that we
should remove it,” said Mary Dor
sey, acting director of the Langone
Center. “The removal ate up all of
June and most of July,” said Barry
Maxwell, vice president — for
administration.

After the

asbestos was

removed, Hepco Construction
began renovating the space. Hepco,
which just finished renovating the
golf course club house, was the
low bidder on the Bison project.
According to Maxwell, the project
has been budgeted at $778,000, of
which approximately $441,000 will
be spent on construction. The con-
struction figure was “less than what
we anticipated it would be,” said
Maxwell, but the cost of removing
the exceeded those
savings

While the new space is being
finished, the Bison snack bar has
been relocated to the Cave, on the

U.C. gets name, facelift

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

New and returning students
will find the Elaine Langone Center
to be a locus of activity on campus
for some common and other not-so-
common reasons. Sometimes
described as the hub of the Univer-
sity and formerly named the Uni-
versity Center, the newly rededi-
cated Langone Center is typically
the site where incoming students
spend hours upon their arrival to
Bucknell. The Center is also under-
going a major renovation project
which adds to the usual turmoil
found on the ground floor level.

Indeed, despite the name
change, the Langone Center
remains very much the center of the
University for students. Within its

brick walls students purchase their
books, receive their mail, attend
classes, and take their meals. On
the floors of the Center one can
find a comfortable corner in which
to study as well as go to the offices
of Residential Life to work out
some bureaucratic difficulty. The
new Bison and Bullseye being con-
structed on the ground floor will
provide a space for students to eat,
socialize, and recreate that was
hitherto unknown at Bucknell.
Center Renamed

The creation of a new Bison
and Bullseye is the first major pro-
ject undertaken in the Center since
it was renamed to honor: Elaine
Langone, wife of Kenneth Langone
~57. Originally dedicated in 1970,
the Center was rededicated on a

weekend in May when the Univer- °

sity’s board of trustees were con-
vened for their annual spring
meeting.

Beside the placing of Elaine
Langone’s name on the facade of
the Center and her portrait in
Arches Lounge on the third floor,
the biggest change in the actual
functioning of the building relative
to the rededication is that the name
on administrative stationary has
changed. All the staff working in
the Center and the services they
provide have not undergone any
transformation due to the May cere-
mony. The Bison/Bullseye renova-
tion, though certainly altering the
internal shape and character of the
building, had been planned far in
advance of the rededication and

Welcome to Bucknell

Welcome class of 1994.

By now you’ve bought your books, your schedule is for the most part set, and you have a few budding
friendships. Your R.A., along with the rest of Residential Life have told what you can not do while you're here at
Bucknell. And, invariably, they have given you an overly optimistic characterization of what you may accom-
plish during your years at this fine institution

What we have presented on these four Pages is a short glimpse of what Bucknell is. These are the happen-
ings of a university entering its second century of existence: construction, academia and the on-going dilemma of
how to grapple with student life.

Act 31, and the university’s interpretational enforcement of the Commonwealth's law, precludes us from
drinking in the privacy of our own dormitory rooms, crowding into fraternity house basements to socialize and
have a beer - and in some views, from generally having a good time. But alas, we are adjusting, albeit slowly.

The Greek system, a long-standing and revered tradition here at Bucknell, has sustained some pretty heavy
damage, mostly in terms of lofty criticism by fac ulty, staff and community. Most Greeks and alumni are upset,
yet seem to be adapting to the notion of restructuring. Again, the administration and the often obscure “powers
that be” embodied in the Board of Trustees, have dictated a very drastic change. The ball has now been handed
down to us. We are to work within a predecided framework to restructure “our” system

The Bison/Bullseye renovation project is slated for completion in early November. And the same folks who
are bringing you playfair and exciting dinners with celebrities like Gary Sojka and Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle,
are planning all kinds of neat activities with which you may occupy your time during Your Stay here at Bucknell
This, you must think, is the good news. It’s change - student space seems to be receiving the priority it should
have received years ago; students will now have an updated social space all to themselves. It’s about time

The really good news, other than the fact that the University has spent over $10 million in the past year
building buildings, is that opportunities for you abound at Bucknell. Whether it’s running for class representative
in the Bucknell Student Government (BSG), running track, joining a fraternity or sorority or becoming a member

of one of the other organizations on campus - there is a veritable plethora of opportunity

You have the chance to be political, journalistic or even artsy. This is what Bucknell is all
nity. Opportunity for individual growth, to explore the vast wealth of knowledge that is our f
finally seek out those deeper things in life and yourself. You have only four years in which to cove

Carpe Diem

This is what you can do at Bucknell. You can effect change on campus and better student lif
tantly, you can expand your own horizons. While we can’t go as far as to say that “
you will get back out,” as Residential Life staffers will try to firmly impress upon you, we do belie

cept of opportunity and student empowerment. This is your chance, make the most of it

Don’t fall into the trap set for you that is orientation. Orient yourselves, and form your Own perspectives

Dunlop.

Indeed, Dunlop is of the
opinion that the whole tenor of
town-student relations is largely
improving. Dunlop cites the coop-
erative effort of town officials,
local landlords, concerned students,
and the University’s administration
as the cause of this positive devel-
opment and increased communica-
tion between parties representing
the Borough and the University on
the Town-Gown Committee.

Student Rentals

Traditionally, a segment of
the student population has lived off
campus in rental units on streets
adjacent to the campus. Leases
passed from student to student for
years creating what amounts to a
student neighborhood comprised of
St. George, St. Catherine, South
7th, and South 6th streets. Accord-
ing to Gray, before even consider-
ing the behavior of student resi-
dents, there are certain patterns
inherent in student rentals which
detract from a residential area.

Primarily there is what she
calls a “cycle of neglect.” Some

landlords who rent to students do
so for two reasons—higher rents
can be asked since students are con-
sidered to be more affluent and less
maintenance can be offered since
Students are less demanding than a
family-oriented resident. Students
themselves, according to Gray, not
only ask less of their landlord in
terms of maintenance, but often
neglect to maintain their residence
since they lack the experience of
having to be responsible for a
home.

The result of this cycle is that
there are neighborhoods in Lewis-
burg which have been poorly main-
tained and the landlord and future
renters cannot be expected to
improve the condition of the unit.

The second negative aspect
of student neighborhoods is that
they are abandoned during school
holidays and breaks. As busy and
vibrant as the South 6th Street
neighborhood may be during the
fall and spring terms, it is desolate

during the summer This sense of a
wansient population is largely not
considered to be conducive to
attracting families and other more
permanent residents to these areas.

Indeed, according to Gray, it
is the goal of the Borough and par-
ticularly the Housing Authority of
Union County to encourage a more
stable residency base in Lewisburg.

“It would be nice to have
more family-owned or owner-
Operator housing in Lewisburg,”
Gray said, “but in moving towards
that we may have already gone as
far as we can go.” Having passed
Borough ordinances stipulating that
no more than three unrelated per-
sons can live in a residence and
calling for stricter property codes,
the Borough had hoped to limit the
expansion of student rentals.

While it is unclear how suc-
cessful these ordinances will be, it
is the case that both this year and
last year, student rentals were not
only found in the South 6th Street
neighborhood, but there were pock-
ets on Market, South Fifth, and
South Fourth streets and on other
blocks of St. Catherine Street.

“IT don’t know how you can
achieve an influx of owner-
operated housing in Lewisburg
with an open market without get-
ting involved in homesteading and
government financing,” Gray said.
The Housing Authority of Union
County is looking at the possibility
of public financing, according to
Gray, but they are not at the Stage
of serious planning.

Increased Conflict

While these issues concern-
ing the demographics of residential
neighborhoods in Lewisburg are of
ongoing importance to town-gown
relations, it is the more Particular
and immediate issues of parties,
noise levels, and public drunken-
ness that aroused the protest of the
Borough community. With refer-
ence to these complaints from the
Borough community, according to
Dunlop, unruly student behavior at,
and traveling to and from parties in
town is the direct cause.

In-town parties at student ren-
tal and students patronizing the bar

are both typical student behaviors
that are to be expected by Borough
residents, and yet the behavior
involved in these activities evoke
an unprecedented negative
response. Considering letters and
opinion articles that appeared in
The Bucknellian during that period
there appeared to be two new fac-
tors which may have exacerbated
the already-existing the conflict
between students and the local
community

The first is that social life on
campus began to change radically
as fraternities began to strictly
enforce University policies against
under-twenty-one drinking and
became less of a focal point for
socializing and drinking. One, per-
haps predictable, result was that
more students, including many
freshmen, went off-campus to
engage in those activities where
they would not be Strictly moni-
tored by campus security forces,
including Residential Assistants
and administrators from the office
of Residential Life.

In addition to an increase in
off-campus parties and the number
of people attending them, the
increasingly spread out locations of
student rentals brought students and
their parties into contact with more
local residents than before.

The result of these two trends
in student social life was that more
Lewisburg residents were affected
by students, often negatively, creat-
ing a larger and more vociferous
body of complaint. The response of
the Borough was to call on the Uni-
versity tO control its students,
accompanied by Chief of Police
Bob Heiter’s vows to arrest any
unruly students in town.

Student Neighbors

Both Gray and Dunlop are of
the opinion that these sorts of stu-
dent-resident conflicts are not
indicative of students in general,
but of a small minority of “prob-
lem” students. Unfortunately,
according to Dunlop, the behavior
of a few students gives a bad repu-
tation to the Bucknell student body
as a whole.

"Misdeeds and stories of mis-

deeds are like rabbits, they multi-
ply,” Dunlop said suggesting that
those misdeeds have been applied
to more students than they should
be.

Gray concurred stating that
the relationship between student
renters and their neighbors who are
more permanent residents cannot
be assessed through generalities. “It
depends on the behavior of individ-
ual students in individual units,”
she said. Gray herself has had stu-
dent neighbors over the years and
found many to be fine, while others
were quite poor.

What is necessary is commu-
nication between student renters
and their neighbors. It is important,
Gray said, for students and local
residents to “get to know each other
as people before they know each
other as problems.” According to
Gray this responsibility lies with
both the student and the local
resident.

Four-Year Residency

Both Dunlop and Gray stated
that, while tensions in town-gown

relations may continue to exist, the
Borough and the University are
unified in their desire to ease the
conflict and establish a basis for
improved student-resident relations
in the future. The new four-year
residency requirement that accom-
panied a package of recommenda-
tions approved by the trustees relat-
ing to the Greek issue appears to be
an effort on the part of the Univer-
sity to gain more control over what
sort of student lives off campus and
is in close contact with the Lewis-
burg community.

The four-year residency
requirement, originally proposed by
President Gary Sojka in the spring,
stipulates that the University can
demand that a student live in cam-
pus housing throughout his or her
time at Bucknell. Students, as a
result, would have to request per-
mission from Residential Life to
rent an apartment or house in
Lewisburg.

While Sojka has stated that \

this mechanism would be used
sparingly to prevent “problem” stu-

dents from living in town, it has
also been suggested in discussions
on campus that this policy might be
a safety net for the University
which may be facing declining
enrollments along with other col-
leges and universities.

Considering the possibility of
empty dormitory beds, the Univer-
Sity could use the four-year resi-
dency requirement to ensure that its
residence halls are filled. At
Present, though, the policy is likely
only to be used to restrain students
who have been cited for extreme or
chronic cases of misconduct.

Insofar as the four-year resi-
dency requirement, to be instituted
in the next academic year, Gray
said that Borough officials are
pleased with the step the University
has taken.

“Tt will make it more of a
reward to live off-campus,” Gray
Stated, “based on student behavior,
academics, and attitude.” The new
University policy, according to
Gray, should act to “filter out
troublemakers.”

second floor of the Langone Cen-
ter, while space in the Scullery will
be used to provide additional Bison
seating.

To supplement food service
available in the Bason itself, Hank
Ross, director of dining services,
predicted that “‘in the interim, we’ ll
cook burgers and things on a gas
grill on the grass outside” the Lan-
gone Center. He also suggested
“Putting a cart on the mall up by
the library” which will sell coffee,
drinks, and pastries during the
breakfast hours.

Ross believes such stop-gap
measures will be well received,

“due to the fact that we have such
an understanding student body.” He
is enthusiastic, too, that “a lot of
stuff’s happening in the Bison.”

Food service available in the
new Bison will be greatly expanded
compared to the service formerly
available. Ross said he plans to
send out a proposed menu, “so peo-
ple are aware of what to expect.”
He anticipates take-out pizza and
char-broiled foods, frozen yogurt
and a salad bar.

Additionally, he plans spe-
cialty events like Mexican night
and seafood night. On certain even-
ings, Ross plans a “bistro kind of
menu, with table service” available.
He also hopes to use glass and
china utensils to replace the dispos-

able products previously utilized.

Dorsey, also believes the new
Bison “should be worth waiting
for.” Along with the plans of dining
services, Dorsey said that many
Programs are planned for the new
space, including live entertainment
on weekend nights and feature film
showings during the week. Before
the new space is completed, Uni-
versity social programming will be
held in alternate locations such as
the Terrace Room, the Langone
Center Forum, and Larison Dining
Hall.

Interview

A&S Dean Gerdes prepares |
changes in curriculum

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

“T think that one thing which
is distinct about the position of
dean is that the dean is the one that
makes sure that the day-to-day
issues are dealt with,” said Dean of
Arts and Sciences Eugenia Gerdes,
who was appointed last spring. But
while the office of the dean may
concentrate on the day-to-day
events of Bucknell, Gerdes has
some plans that may significantly
affect the University.

Gerdes, who has been at
Bucknell for fourteen years as a
professor of psychology and two
years as an administrator,
expressed particular interest in reju-
venating an active concern for the
quality of teaching on the part of
the University. More importantly,
though, Gerdes is already partici-
pating in an effort to revise the Uni-
versity’s general education
program.

These “day-to-day” concerns
such as faculty-student ratios,
teaching loads, and residential col-
leges, Gerdes stated, “if taken
together do have a_ significant
impact on the institution and make
it necessary that we step back and
examine our principles.”

Two principles that Gerdes
identified as central to the Bucknell
education were quality teaching
and critical thinking, and she is
undertaking projects to support and
augment both.

“It is very clear that we are
interested in how our faculty
teaches,” Gerdes said. “This is the
place where the dean’s office has to
play a leading role.”

Gerdes cited the “mentor pro-
gram” that was adopted recently by
the faculty which would provide
teaching assistance for the junior
faculty teacher from a_ senior
faculty member outside of his or
her department.

“Tt is okay for a faculty mem-
ber to be looking for ways to
improve their teaching,” Gerdes
said. “It does not amount to a per-
sonal weakness because we were
not taught how to teach.” Gerdes
said that most graduate programs
do very little to develop the teach-
ing talents of its students who are
soon to become professors.

The most important task of
the teacher, according to Gerdes, is
to develop their students’ ability to
think critically. Responding to a
faculty that is disappointed in the
level of critical thinking in the stu-
dent body, Gerdes has undertaken
the task to coordinate a new general
education program for the
University.

“We are saying to the
faculty,” Gerdes commented, “if
you are disappointed with the criti-
cal thinking of your students, help
us develop those skills in students.”

The initial outcome of this
effort is a pilot program of Founda-
tion Seminars that is being offered
this semester for the class of 1994.
These courses are inter-disciplinary
programs which will require that
students approach the topics at
hand from a number of perspec-
tives. Examples of topics are “Zen
and the Arts,” “Learning in an
Information Age,” and ‘“Darwin-
ism: The Lamp and its Shadow.”
The class size is to be capped at
around fifteen students, with the
instructor serving as advisor to
most of the students enrolled in the
class

Gerdes said that the effort
arose out of the desire to institu-

faculty meeting. Jenks argued that
the Greek system is sexist, elitist,
racist, and anti-intellectual. The
motion was tabled until the faculty
received the report from the Greek
Review Comittee (GRC), formed
because of incidentswhich occurred
during 1988-89. The report con-
cluded that Bucknell’s Greek sys-
tem should be retained with minor
changes. But the faculty disagreed
with the report, and they over-
whelmingly approved Jenks’
motion. After a long review pro-

tionally answer the question of
what it means to be educated. “We
have to state more explicity that
students have to see the world from
a variety of perspectives,” Gerdes
said, “not just the ones they came
to Bucknell with.” According to
Gerdes a key component of these
Foundation Seminars will be
addressing issues of race, class, and
gender which can often become
secondary issues amongst Buck-
nell’s relatively homogeneous stu-
dent body.

Explicitly addressing such
issues is part of a larger national
trend within universities respond-
ing both to recognized absences in
their curriculum and an attempt to
use education to combat the ignor-
ance that leads to violence against
minority populations on campus.

Gerdes said that, while the
situation at Bucknell is much less
severe than at other institutions,
“there is an overt sense among
some students of ‘I’m in the major-
ity—my views are right and the
others are wrong.’”

“The issues are there,”
Gerdes stated, “and although Buck-
nell is relatively homogeneous the
world is not that way.”

Beyond this initial year,
Gerdes said that there are tentative
plans to develop a program based
on the principles of the Foundation
Seminars for a larger general edu-
cation program that would replace
the present system of distribution
requirements.

This general outline of the
Foundation Seminars resembles
that of the Freshman Advisory
Seminars and Gerdes noted that
“the Foundation Seminars may not
be too far from their original pur-
pose.” Gerdes said that the Univer-
sity had not provided enough insti-
tutional support for the FAS
program and, as a result, it has not
fulfilled the hopes that people origi-
nally had for it.

A memorandum from the
General Education Committee, of
which Gerdes is a member, detail-
ing the objectives and initial stages
of planning for the Foundation
Seminars was mailed to faculty in
March and has met with a response
that Gerdes called “mixed.” Gerdes
did say that people who were
involved with FAS or the residen-
tial colleges seemed to be more
favorably inclined toward the
program.

Questions have been raised as
to whether the program would be

cess, in which Sojka had to weigh
the views of the student body, the
faculty, and the approximately 800
alumni who wrote to him, Sojka
delivered his recommendations to
the Board of Trustees on May 1.
His proposals elicited a backlash
from the faculty because they did
not feel that the measures taken
properly dealt with the charges of
sexism, elitism, racism, and anti-
intellectualism. They then circu-
lated a petition condemning elitist
organizations on campus. However,
this protest did not significantly

more historically oriented or more
concerned with current affairs and
crises—both approaches have a
body of adherents. There is also the
criticism that the approach sup-
ported by Gerdes strays too far
from a “great-books” conception of
general education.

Gerdes says that she has
already been told by critics that this
plan for creating a general educa-
tion program on the plan of the
Foundation Seminars would repre-
sent anything but —_ general
education.

Looking ahead, as a plan for
the development of the larger gen-
eral education plan out of this pilot
Project, Gerdes expressed what she
called “a very tentative plan” for a
system based on clusters of
courses.

“Instead of taking four
humanities but the University not
taking an interest in which four the
Student takes, there wold be a
theme.” The goal of such a cluster
program would be, according to
Gerdes, “not to go on ina particular
field, but to think and deal with the
world.”

“Right now, with our general
education requirement, we do not
ask that there be any coherence in
the student’s program,” Gerdes
said.

On more general issues con-
cerning her new office Gerdes said
that she understood the position of
the dean to be, primarily, the level
of administration that is directly in
contact with faculty and students
and responsible for mediating the
concerns of these groups.

As a mediator and mutual
representative of the interests of the
administration, the faculty, and the
students it is sometimes difficult to
see how the dean can be an autono-
mous position. Part of being dean,
according to Gerdes, is “keeping
things in line with the thinking of
the people in the higher levels of
administration. The dean’s deci-
sions have to fit into that context.”

Yet there is more to the posi-
tion than mediation. “There is a
delicate balance,” Gerdes added
“in having to be part of a total
administrative picture and dealing
actively with issues. I must be able
to understand the issues from those
three perspective [administration,
faculty, and student] and be seen as
having some integrity of my own.”

Gerdes said that her long
experience at Bucknell as both a
faculty member and an administra
tor have given her the ability to
understand the differing perspec
tives on the issues that concern the
University.

Asked about recent tensions
between the faculty and the admin
istration surrounding
teaching, scholarship, and recent
decisions by the University Review
Committee, Gerdes said, “I per
ceive the situation as somewhat
better than it was a couple of years
ago.”

“Tt might just be a fact of
life,” Gerdes said with reference to
the distance that lies between the
faculty and administration. “When
there are different roles there tends
to be some reservation about pco-
ple in roles other than your own.”

“Differences between people
can be extreme or they can be mini-
mal, but they cannot be completely
removed,” Gerdes stated. She went
on to say that the problems facing
Bucknell were actually part of
larger national trends in higher
education.

Issues of

affect the Trustees’ decision.
Sojka’s recommendations were
reviewed by a special comittee of
five trustees. This committee
approved all of Sojka’s recommen-
dations, except one which would
have required a minimum GPA of
2.5 to rush, as opposed to the 2.0
minimum for participation in all
other campus groups. Finally, the
Board of Trustees adopted all of the
committee’s recommendations
except the 2.5 GPA.

was unrelated to the changing of
the name affixed to the Center.

As far as the new name of the
Center gaining currency amongst
the University community, Asso-
Vice President for Student
Life Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle
said that the process would
undoubtedly take time. In speaking
with upperclassmen, Jacobsen
Weddle found many who state that,
to them, the building would always
be the University Center. Others
have taken to calling the building
the L.C., and some have begun to
refer to the Elaine Langone Center
as the E.L.C. (pronounced elk).

Stating that “the student ver-
nacular comes from its own ori-
gins,” Jacobsen Weddle believes
that students will eventually arrive
at a term which will satisfy their
tastes and eventually gain wide-
spread usage.

What is important, according
to Jacobsen Weddle, is that the
Center continues to serve as the
center of the University. Jacobsen
Weddle referred to the Center as
being “the living room of the Uni-
versity” where students, faculty,
administrators, and staff meet on an

be vacated when the new science

sal suggests relocating the person-
nel department and the career

tion of administrative staff offices

very fortunate to this point [that
there have been no accidents],”
Naugle said in a May interview
with The Bucknellian.

University administration,
students, and the engineering firm
constructing the underpass have all
expressed concern about the safety
of persons using the underpass. As
specified in a February memoran-
dum, Barry Maxwell, vice presi-
dent for administration, explained
that several measures are being
taken to insure the safety of stu-
dents. These safety measures
include 24-hour video security
monitoring and “push-to-talk”-type
microphones that will provide
direct contact with Bucknell Secur-
ity. It is the opinion of those
involved in the project that this
combination of security measures
will provide students with a signifi-
cantly safer means of access to and
from Bucknell West.

The construction of the
underpass, though hindered by
inclement weather during the sum-
mer, is on budget and only two
weeks behind schedule, according
to Naugle. He said, “all that’s left is

- the finish work” and that should be

completed in about two weeks.

egalitarian basis over meals and at
meetings.
Part of the Family

Both Elaine and Kenneth
Langone, who were the focus of the
May rededication ceremony for the
Center, recognize Bucknell as
being highly significant in their
lives. As an alumnus Mr. Langone
remained closely associated with
the University and was elected to
the board of trustees and named
chair of national giving in 1981.
Mrs. Langone, according to her
friends and family, shared her hus-
band’s dedication to Bucknell.
Married in 1956, the Langones
lived in an apartment on Market
Suet during Mr. Langone’s senior
year at Bucknell.

“Bucknell University has
been a par’ of our family,” Mrs.
Langone said in May as_ she
acknowledged the gesture Mr. Lan-
gone and the University made in
renaming the Center in her honor.

Beyond offering the Univer-
sity an opportunity to name this
central building something more
colorful than the “University Cen-
ter,” the rededication is important
relative to the University’s endow-
ment. According to University pol-
icy, at least fifty percent of the orig-

building” housing the top adminis-
trators and academic deans.

The new campus landscape
master plan is also expected carly
this semester, according to Max-
well. Included in the report will be
recommendations for on-hill park-
ing and green space. Included in
the report will be recommendations
for the Olin-Dana quad. Plans to
remove the road between the build-
ings and landscape the area have
been discussed. While the master
plan will not specifically address
the issue of dwindling open space
as a campus-wide issue, Maxwell
said, “[The Univeristy community]
is concerned about the loss of green
space, and we share that concern.”

New alcohol policy implemented

Student groups find problems with new penalties,
BSG ad hoc committee formed to investigate

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Bucknell’s new alcohol pol-
icy was put into affect on Septem-
ber 7, 1990. The policy, authored
by John P. Dunlop, Dean of Stu-
dents, and approved by President
Sojka, completely outlines the uni-
versity’s rules governing alcohol,
and sanctions for violations.

The policy, which all stu-
dents received by campus mail, is
dated August 31. According to
Dunlop though, students did not
receive the policy until September
6, making Friday September 7, the
first full day that students were
aware of the policy.

The policy includes manda-
tory punishments for both individu-
als and groups that increase with
each violation. Dunlop will be issu-
ing an addendum for group sanc-
tions. As the policy stands now,
groups face two weeks for their
first violation. Dunlop’s addendum

T.I.P. begins work on social/
residential recommendations

By Andrew Cohen and
Bob Ritter
Staff Writers

Students, faculty, administra-
tors, and alumni met to discuss the
future of Bucknell’s “social-
residential” system on Sunday Sep-
tember 9, 1990. The 83 people who
attended the meeting, now mem-
bers of the Trustee Implementation
Planning (TIP) task force, are
charged with the task of developing
a vehicle for instituting the social
reforms that the trustces enacted on
May 12, 1990. Many faculty mem-
bers stayed away from the work-
shop because of dissatisfaction with
the proposals being discussed.

Dave Skena 92, president of Buck-
nell Student Government (BSG),
and Charlotte Jacobsen-Weddle,
vice president for student life, will
co-chair the task force’s steering
committee. President Gary Sojka
formally opened the meeting by
stressing the importance of student
participation in deciding their own
future. “It has to be a student led
thing, but there has to be structure...
Students are to lead us to the
answers that we want.”

Skena and Jacobsen have
altempted to develop such a struc-
ture by creating five task teams
focusing on different areas of the
plan: Changes in the Greck System,
Residential Changes, Social

Tim Murrell leaves Bucknell today after eight year of service to the
university in the Office of Security and Safety

Murrell takes job at
Butler University

By Theresa Kane
Staff Writer

Timothy Murrell ends four
years of service to the University as
Director of Sccurity and Safety
today. Starting Monday, September
17th he begins work at Butler Uni-
versity in Indianapolis, Indiana in
the capacity of Director of Public
Safety.

According to Murrell, Buck-
nell is conducting a national search
for his replacement. In the mean-
time Michael Amarante, Patrol
Supervisor, will be Acting Director.
When asked if someone currently

on the Security and Safety staff
would be considered for the posi-
tion, Barry Maxwell, vice-president
for administration, stated that there
are no intemal or local
candidates.”

Murrell says that he has
“enjoyed his time at Bucknell” and
is proud of what has been accom-
plished in the last four years espe-
cially the installation of a central-
ized life-safety alarm system, the
publication of crime prevention
materials, and improved relations
with the Lewisburg police.

Changes, the Freshman Year Expe-
rience, and the Residency Require-
ment. Each team was given target
completion dates for its recommen-
dation to Sojka. Sojka must then
approve the recommendations or
send them back to the particular
task team to be reworked. (Each
task team chose a chair at the meet-
ing on Sunday to serve on the
Steering Committee with Skena
and Jacobsen).

According to Jacobsen-
Weddle, the teams will have open
weekly meetings. She described the
Task Force as ‘“‘very much a sun-
shine process where we’re open in
our discussions and deliberations.”
Though she did add that “executive
sessions” might sometimes be
neccessary.

John Peeler, professor of
political science, expressed reserva-
tions about the implementation pro-

will stiffen the penalty to two
weeks of social probation for cach
infraction that occurs during a
group’s first violation. For exam-
ple, an unregistered party carries
four violations: 1) not registering
the party; 2) failure to hire a secur-
ity monitor; 3) failure to hire a bar-
tender; and 4) alcohol outside of
the segregated drinking area. Each
violation in this scenario would
result in two weeks social proba-
tion, and thus the group would face
eight total weeks of social
probation.

Dunlop concedes that Act 31
played a major role in the new pol-

icy. “Misuse of alcohol is an
inc ing concern to the Univer-
Sity as it was to society in general
and state legislatures... [The legisla-
ture made] it very clear that they
passed Act 31 for universities.
They know drinking has been very
very prevalent.”

Some student groups have
voiced concem over certain aspects
of the policy. Specifically, Buck-
nell Student Government (BSG)
unanimously passed a motion to
create an ad hoc committee to look
into where money collected from
fines will go, and possible alterna-
tives for group sanctions.

Currently, money collected
from both individual and group
fines is being held in escrow.
According to George Smimoff,
author of the motion, the committee
will attempt to come up with a fair
system for dispensing this money
to campus groups.

Smirnoff also expressed con-
cer over the issue of mandatory
sanctions for group violations. He
noted that compulsory punishments
only punish the fact that some vio-
lation was committed while they
fail to “punish the [specific]
crime.”

While Dunlop and BSG had
come close to reaching agreement
on all other aspects of the policy,

Caf worker charged in
theft of $8,000 in goods

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

In response to the arrest of a
Bucknell employee for the theft of
food products this July, Dining Ser-
vices and the Office of Security and
Safety have formulated a new sys-
tem to oversee the procurement and
use of consumable goods. Accord-
ing to Hank Ross, director of din-
ing services, these additional secur-
ity measures will include locked
containers and bins, the accounting
for items as they are transferred
from the warehouse to the Langone
Center, and a closer regulation of
who holds keys

The employee who is accused
of removing these items from the
cafeteria, Jerry Lee Yordy, waived
his right to a preliminary hearing
on Sept. 6. Based upon his and his
defense counsel’s decision to waive
this hearing, Yordy will face
charges of theft and receiving sto-
len property—both are determined
to be felony 3—in Union County
Court.

Rudinsky, and arresting officer Ser-
geant Barry Hosterman of the East

Ferraro cleared of
criminal charges

By Travis Elliott
Staff Writer

Bucknell University wres-
ling coach Robert Ferraro was
cleared of a worthless check charge
at a preliminary hearing held in
August. Milton District Justice Wil-
liam Kear ruled that the prosecu-
tion had failed to prove that Fer-
raro, the president of Decathlon
Athletics in Milton, knowingly
approved a check for which there
were not sufficient funds.

According to the testimony of
Decathlon employee Jan Clemens,
she wrote the $1,300 check at Fer-
raro’s request to BTR Inc. on
March 20 to cover back rent due on
Decathlon’s Milton office. Clemens
also testified that sufficient funds
were available to cover the check
until another employee wrote more
checks which could not be covered
on March 21.

BTR official Richard Bower-
sox testified that when the check
was returned for insufficient funds,
he sent a certified letter to Decath-
lon, but that letter was returned
unopened. Bowersox then notified
Milton police Detective Charles
Dugan Jr. who subsequently filed
the charge against Ferraro.

In response to the charge Fer-
raro said, “A false police report
was filed by the Milton police, and
T intend to find out why.”

Bowersox also filed a
civil suit on behalf of BTR, Inc.
which ended in a judgement against
Decathlon for $3,289.50 in past due
rent. In a similar suit, Allison of
Rochester, Inc. was awarded
$747.92 for past due invoices that
Decathlon had failed to pay. Fur-
thermore, Ferraro and Michael
Conners, Decathlon co-owner,
were named as co-defendants in a
civil suit filed by Duane Dotta for
$4,054.90 in unpaid invoices.

In March of 1988, Ferraro
was charged with setting up, main-
taining, and selling or exposing for
sale a lottery numbers game, all in
violation of Section 5512 of the
Pennsylvania crimes code, a misde-
meanor of the first degree. The pro-
gram, which was a fund- raiser for
the Bucknell wrestling club,
involved the sale of calendars
which were informally linked to the
Pennsylvania State Lottery. How-
ever, the case was dismissed when
Ferraro returned the participants’
monies and explained that he was
unaware of the illegality of the
fund-raising operation.

Ferraro has been the wres-
uing coach at Bucknell for 17
years. In 1986 and again in 1988,
he was chosen as coach of the year
in the East Coast Conference. In
addition, Ferraro posted his 100th
win while coaching at Bucknell on
Feb. 10, 1988.

Buffalo Township police force on
July 3, Yordy admitted that he had
taken items from the then Univer-
sity Center.

According to the statement of
probable cause found in the public
record, over $8,000 in goods were
determined to have been removed
by Yordy between March and May
1990. As of May 5, Sccurity and
Dining Services had been alerted
Yordy had been distributing goods
such as bleach, ketchup, olives, and
coffee to the Winfield Auction
Center and Stahl Sale Galleries in
West Buffalo Township. Of this
total dollar figure, $4,219 in goods
was found stored on Yordy’s prop-
erty in Winfield.

Ross was unable to add many
particulars to the case as he said he
had been away during the time
Yordy’s arrest. But Ross did say

that he had noticed increased usage
of certain items which were typi-
cally not depleted at a high rate.

“Finally, I did not know
where these items were going or
what was happening to them,” Ross
said. These incidences of not being
able to account for items were
exacerbated by the sheer volume of
food and non-food products that is
used by Dining Services. Ross esti-
mated that in food alone Dining
Services spends over $1.75 million
every year.

The new security measures
are meant to diminish the possibil-
ity that persons can casually
remove food from the cafeteria as
Yordy did. Officer James Middle-
ton of Security and Safety stated
that “the procedure put in place will
make that type of activity unlikely

Staff Writer

After great anticipation and
nine months of delays, the new
uphill parking lot behind fraternity
row was opened last week, adding
94 student parking spaces and 64
staff spaces. Although the new lot
will help case overcrowding, auto-
mobile registration figures reveal
that uphill student parking is still
overcrowded.

The Office of Security and
Safety has issued 545 red parking
decals to students residing in
Swartz, Kress, Trax and Roberts
Halls, while only 358 parking
spaces are available for those stu-
dents. There are a total of 154 bluc,
or open, spaces available in the
new parking lot and the stadium
lot, but these spaces are not cnough
to erase the deficit on the hill.

While the total number of Univer-
sity-controlled student _ parking
spaces on campus excedes the
number of decals issued, Richard
McGinnis, associate professor of
civil engineering and chairman of
the parking committee, noted that
this total does not include on-street
parking on campus, including 170
spaces along Moore Avenue.
McGinnis explained that these
spaces alone ensure that there are
more than enough parking spaces
on campus. Despite the problems
uphill, McGinnis said that “no new
parking projects are planned at this
time,” since all registered vehicles
can be accommodated on campus.
The parking committec’s
first meeting of the semester is
scheduled for next weck. Among
the topics on the agenda, McGinnis
said that the relocation of staff

Staff in the finance department
have had to relocate to the
Chemistry building due to poor
air quality.

By Natalie Dunlap

Problems with the indoor air
quality at Marts Hall have caused
discomfort for members of the
finance department and have led to
their relocation to the basement of
the Chemistry Building.

Two rooms on the figst floor
of Marts Hall are the normal loca-
tion of the finance department.
Members of this department were
experiencing what Charlotte Han-
selman, manager of financial ser-
vices, described as “typical upper
respiratory symptoms.” These
symptoms included watery eyes,
irritated nose, sore throat, sinus
headaches, and occasional chest
pains. People with previous aller-
gics generally were affected most
by the air in this area of Marts.

Hanselman, who experi-
enced these discomforts herself,
said that approximately 12 of the

efforts encompass Phase Two.
Phase Three will further expand
the program to include fraternitics.
Phase Four will involve uphill resi-
dence halls.

Trutt says that Puskarich
will continue as the student repre-
sentative mecting with students,
resident assistants, and the Inter-
Fraternity Council to help the
Bucknell community recycle
properly.

According to Trutt, the main
aim of the program is to decrease
the amount of trash gencrated by
the University and to comply with
Act 101, a Pennsylvania law man-
dating that municipalitics and insti-
tutions like Bucknell begin recy-
cling efforts. The program
currently costs the university
money, but in the long run the
funds collected from the recyclable
goods and the moncy saved in gar-
bage hauling costs will more than
make up for it.

Bucknell generates 1700
tons of trash a year, cnough to fill
Davis Gym twice. The University
pays $42/ ton to haul the trash

away, amounting to a total of over
$70,000/ year. Puskarich stated that
with a successful plan, the amount
of trash could decrease by as much
as thirty percent.

Both Puskarich and Ben
Marsh, Associate Professor of
Geography, urge everyone to
beware of packaging when shop-
ping. According to Marsh, a com-
mon misconception is that “you
can do anything as long as you
recycle.” Marsh and Pushkarich
suggested that as consumers we
beware of products that are over-
packaged and buy ones that do not
have several layers of wrapping.
Bringing canvas bags to the book-
store and grocery store is a simple
way to avoid non-biodegradable
bags.

Puskarich received praise
from Trutt and Marsh for her work
in the project. Marsh stated that
“Penny did an extraordinary job in
helping the University.” He also
praised the “impressive coopera-
tion from the University.”

Puskarich said that first year
students are cooperating with the
program. She said socicty as a
whole must change its attitude and

we should talk about.” When asked
about a plan which would switch
the 41 staff and service spaces in
the Trax lot with the 40 red decal
spaces in the new parking lot,
McGinnis said, “That’s certainly a
possibility, [since] it would add 50
percent to the parking for Kress,
Trax and Roberts.” He said such a
Proposal had not been considered
previously because “we decided not
to make any plans until after the
opening” of the new parking lot.
McGinnis said the parking
committee will also be discussing
methods for combatting chronic
abusers of campus parking, includ-
ing the possible use of a “boot,” a
device which locks onto a car's
wheel, preventing the car from
being moved. He said the proposal
calls for the "boot" to be used on
vehicles belonging to students with
eight or more parking tickets, as

staff out

15 members of the finance depart-
ment experienced some form of
these symptoms. Generally the
symptoms were “short-lived,” and
once out of that area of the build-
ing, people did not suffer any
discomfort.

At this point, the source of
the indoor air quality problem
remains unknown. Dennis Hawley,
assistant director of the physical
plant, is coordinating the investiga-
tions in Marts Hall. Three different
indoor air quality consultants have
looked into the situation. Such
steps such as changing air filters,
adjusting air flow, and putting
more fresh air into that section of
the building have been attempted.
Most recently, experts have looked
for microbiological growth in the
air and are now waiting for the
results of these tests.

Hanselman is pleased that
“all steps have been taken” in these

well as unauthorized vehicles
belonging to freshmen. In
extreme cases towing may also
be used.

McGinnis justified the
proposed measures, saying, "If
{students} are abusing parking
priveleges, they shouldn't take
spaces from someone abiding
by the rulcs." McGinnis also
said that an open forum for the
campus community will be held
before any changes are
finalized.

Among other proposals may
be a plan to block out a row of
parking spaces in Bucknell West
nearest to the intramural ficlds for
blue (open) spaces. McGinnis said,
“Tt really doesn’t make sense to
have all yellow [spaces] out there”
since visitors to Bucknell West cur-
rently have no place to park legally.

investigations and that the univer-
sity as well as other outside organ-
izations have been “doing every-
thing possible” to find the source
of the problem. Barry Maxwell,
vice president for administration,
also praised the progression of the
situation when he commented that
“the finance office staff has been
remarkably understanding and
cooperative through this frustrat-
ing process.”

While Marts Hall is going
through what Hanselman referred
to as the “sick building syn-
drome,” the finance department
has been temporarily relocated to
the lower level of the chemistry
building. The offices that can be
found there are Student Accounts,
the Cashier, the Check Cashing
Window, Student Payroll, and the
Director of Accounting and Busi-
ness Services.

Electrical fires strike
SAE and 7th St. House

By Tara G. Gilligan

An electrical fire reported at
6:45 a.m. on Aug. 20 damaged the
walls and cciling of the kitchen at
Sigma Alpha Epsilon. The fire
was attributed to an over-loaded
extension cord, used to plug in two
industrial-size kitchen appliances.

Because the fire broke out
several weeks before the start of
school, no students were present at
the time of the fire.

Jim McCormick, Director of
Safety, said the extension cord,
which was attached to both an
upright freezer and an industrial
refrigerator, melted, starting the
fire. Firemen extinguished the
blaze before it spread to other parts
the house.

Costs of the damage are not
available. The university and the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter are
currenuly discussing who will pay
for damages. Because the fire was
not caused by faulty wiring,
McCormick said, “I think the fra-
ternity should be held responsible
for any damages; replacing any
equipment that was lost.”

Chris Daniels, president of
SAE, said, “Right now we’re
working with the university just to
take care of the slight damage.”

Daniels expressed concern
over the safcty of students in the
fraternity. “What we’re concerned
about is just the wiring in the
kitchen,” he said.

According to Gerry Com-
merford, Assistant Dean for Hous-
ing, the fire was not the result of
deficient wiring in the building.
“The university has a premium on
safety. All of our buildings are up
to date, and all of the wiring is up
to date,” he said.

In addition to the fire at
SAE, the university has been
plagued by other minor electrical
fires. A fire which broke out on

Apr. 20 in a third floor bedroom at
the Seventh Street House also
resulted from an overworked
extension cord.

Elcctrical fires such as these
are not new to the campus.
According to McCormick, an aver-
age of five or six electrical fires
break out on campus each year.
McCormick cited a number of
causes for these electrical fires.

“We can run the whole
gambit: smoking in bed, the use of
candles, unattended pots on a
stove,” McCormick said, listing a
few of the causes of dormitory
fires.

No students have been hurt
in any of the campus fires. In the
event of a fire, sprinkler systems in
all of the buildings would be acti-
vated. All residential buildings
with wood rooms arc equipped
with up to date smoke detectors
and sprinklers.

Both McCormick and Com-
merford have worked on programs
to reduce the threat of fire. During
the summer, the university sent
students a list of appliances, such
as toaster ovens and microwaves,
to leave at home. Commerford
said “the safety and security are
only as good as the people living
in the facilities. Our staff can only
do so much.”

The first step in reducing
the number of fires, McCormick
said, would be to “stop cooking in
our rooms. No cooking appliances
in the rooms.”

“We do fire safety inspec-
tions throughout the course of the
year,” Commerford But
because students know about the
inspections in advance, they are
not entircly effective, according to
Commerford. He said that many
students remove cooking appli-
ances from their rooms prior to the
Inspection.

sanctions for group viola-
tions were “left up in the air”
when the spring semester
ended. Because of the
urgency to have the policy in
effect by this fall, Dunlop
opted for group sanctions
that would act as a deterrent
by revealing the “exact mag-
nitude of the consequences.”
According to Dunlop, the
policy would have been
incomplete had the univer-
sity merely written prohibi-
tions into the policy without
allowing students the benefit
of knowing the
consequences.

This does not preclude
another form of group pun-
ishment as long as there is a
system where students are
aware of the consequences
for breaking the rules, and as
long as President Sojka gives
his approval.

cess, which he said has “lost sight
of the basic principles of Sojka’s
recommendations.” Later this
week, Peeler, academic coordina-
tor for the residential colleges, said
that he would participate in the
review process because of “my
obligation to that program.”

Peeler, however, attacked the
lack of structure in the implemen-
tation process, citing the “real dan-
ger of losing sight of the principles
and the goals of the University
without constant attention from the
stecring committee.” [The com-
plete text of Peeler’s Icttcr appears
below]. Some other TIP members
also expressed reservations about
the structure of the task force.

While Peeler feels the co-
chairpersons “certainly have the
best of intentions”, another mem-
ber explained, “[Jacobsen-Weddle]
seems to be trying to siccr our
committce’s focus through ‘polite
suggcstions.””

Among the 83 members of
the University community present
at the TIP workshop there were
less than a dozen faculty members.
Peeler blamed the “insufficnt atten-
tion to [the faculty’s] principles in
the recommendations, [causing] a
great many to fecl rather

marginalized.”

Two of the principle partici-
pants in last year’s review process
had paid little attention to the TIP
Process, but echoed Pecler’s com-
ments about faculty involvement.
George Jenks, collection develop-
ment librarian and the author of the
faculty motion to abolish the Greek
system, said, “I don’t suppose
much is going to happen, but I
think they’re trying to get many to
Participate. There’s not great
enthusiasm, [since] the whole pro-
cedure is counter to what the
faculty wanted.”

Steve Becker, chairman and
associate professor of physics, also
an outspoken critic of the Sojka
recommendations, said that “the
faculty are too busy doing other
things.” Becker went on to say that
the Trustces “are meddling in cam-
pus affairs, [since they] shouldn’t
be approving detailed
recommendations.”

Speaking about the faculty
members who stayed away from
the workshop, Skcna said, “It’s
unfortunate we don’t have their
opinions to hear, [but] | don’t ques
tion their dedication to the Univer
sity. They also realize that by not
getting involved it will be casicr to
comment on the implementation

The Bucknellian

plan.”

Sojka stressed the importance
of the TIP task force, alluding to
adage that “Tomorrow may never
come, [and] I hope you, like me,
are beginning to realize that.” How-
ever, Sojka was also quick to stress
the opportunitics that the task force
has, calling the process “‘an extraor-
dinary opportunity, an opportunity
not to get by, not to smooth things
Out, not to take care of business...
but an opportunity to make Buck-
nell a university for other universi-
tics to emulate.”

Sojka explained that the
problems that the University is
dealing with are the same problems
that plague society as a whole.
“Social interractions are the one
arca where we seem to make no
real progress... The social problems
that bedevil humanity today are the
same ones we dealt with in the
cave, and you have an opportunity
{to change them].”

Sojka went on to describe
the TIP task force as “hands on
social science.” Jacobsen echoed
Sojka’s tone by stressing the uni-
versity’s “goals for the develop-
ment of students as total persons...
[who] have some awareness of
value that will in fact make society
a better place.”

Objections to TIP voiced

Dear Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle:

I want to express as clearly as I can my principal concerns with the TIP process. First, as I said Sunday,
the structure of the implementation process carrics the grave danger of losing sight of the underlying princi-
ples that should be served (i.c. the mission and goals of the university, the principles articulated by Gary
Sojka in his report to the Board (adopted by the Board)). 1 am not sure, with an cssentially toothless stecring
committee, that we will get the kind of rigorous, careful thinking that is necessary here

Second, I think the constitution of the task gi

roups is likely, in at Icast some cases, to Iead to proposals

calculated to vitiate or indeed evisccrate the purposes of the President's proposals. There is no assurance at

all that advocates of fundamental change will have an adequate voic

¢ in some of these groups. The Steering

Commitice has no authority; it is Icft to the president alone to assure that the reforms really serve their osten-
sible purposes. The idca that students should be principally responsible for redesigning the social/residential
life that students have largely shaped heretofore docs not serve the mission of the university very well. How
can we expect these same students, unaided by us, to produce anything better? Are we not educators?
Finally, I am very concemed that the procedure you project allows no Opportunity to either the BSG or
the Faculty for input. The report simply goes to the President. I would urge that a step be added, prior to the
report to the President. And in the same vein, I would urge that we go beyond the annual report mechanism
to provide for a full view of the situation after three or four years.

Student center survives the test of time

Since its construction, the former UC has been a big topic of conversation.

By Sue Basalla
Staff Writer

For many of us, the renaming
of the University Center as the
Elaine Langone Center last spring
seemed redundant and ridiculous.

“What’s wrong with calling it
the UC?” we asked. “We can’t just
Start saying ‘Langone Center’ when
it’s the same old place!” After all
of these years, who’s going to say,
“Yea, I stopped off at the Langone
Center to get my mail?” It just
doesn’t sound right.

And so we kept calling that
comerstone of our campus, that hub
of our hometown, that essential
everyday edifice, the “UC.”
Nobody could stop us. You'd think
that we'd built the place ourselves
and Elaine was trying to steal the
credit.

But now, back on campus
after summer vacation, we hear the
new freshmen (those misguided
youths) actually using the new
name in sentences like, “I think the
biology lab is in the basement of
the Langone Center.” Suddenly, we
realize that in a few years everyone

will be saying “Langone Center”
and call us old fogeys for clinging
to the out-dated “UC.”

Why do we care if a 20 year-
old building is renamed? Obvi-
ously, we (like all humans) resist
change. So imagine how the cam-
Pus reacted to the construction of
the UC in the first place. Seeing the
grassy hill on the corner of Moore
Avenue and 7th Street taken over
by a hulking brick monster wasn't a
simple transition for the Bucknel-
lians of the 60’s and 70’s.

Everyone agreed that a cam-
pus center was needed, but when it
was completed in 1970, not every-
one approved of the building itself.

B.U.C. (Before the Univer-
sity Center), the Bison squatted
Next to Vedder, the Bookstore
crowded itself into Carnegie and
three cafeterias stretched across
Larison, Swartz and Cooley Halls
Most of the Kress art collection
hung in the Bertrand Library. The
various clubs and committees took
refuge in the dimly lit corners of
dormitories and class buildings.

Yet, this new all-
encompassing campus center was

not received without some trepida-
tion. According to George Jenks,
librarian at the time of construction,
the new University Center was
described by a professor of his
acquaintance as architecturally sim-
ilar to “an Albanian railway sta-
tion.” Others suggested that paint-
ing the UC arches golden. would
complete the building’s resem-
blance to a McDonald’s.

As time passed, however,
people grew accustomed to the UC.
Jim Hammerlee, director of student
activities during the early years of
the UC, commented that it was “the
first major building on campus with
a different kind of architecture. At
first there was some feeling that the
new building intruded, but now it is
generally well-received.”

Within a few years, the name
Langone will grow familiar and
smooth on our tongues, just as the
UC building’s harsh edges have
blended into the background of
grassy hills. Time will take care of
it all...until the biology building is
finished.

Courtest of University Archives

Before the completion of the Langone Center, student facilities such as the Bison were scattered across the
campus. Here, in the 1950’s, the Bison was located next to Vedder in the building where the current biol-

ogy labs exist.

Masonry and student life

“All of us are going to be bricks
as we work to implement the trustee’ s plan

— Ed Dadez

Bricks. We are all bricks. Bricks in a process that is to give “vitality and beauty to this master plan [of a

University system]” in the words of Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle.

Bricks are regular, hard, consistent and inanimate objects. Bricks don’t vary too much on the whole.

They're heated and molded into the desired shape. Bricks are commonplace and dull. Bricks lack imagination,

they’re all the same size and shape. But best of all, bricks all fit nicely into place.

Trustee Implementation Planning (TIP) is all about bricks it seems — and their mason. It’s about homoge-

neity, regularity and a good, tight fit

Our social-residential system, one of the most significant aspects of student life at our fine University, is

being shaped. It’s being molded to fit a blueprint and it’s been assigned a specific time schedule. The future of

student life at Bucknell, a university in it’s second century, is being determined in six short months.

Participation in this grand scheme is by the few: the fraternity and sorority presidents, representatives from

the offices of Student and Residential Life

delegates from Bucknell Student Government (BSG) and a handful of

interested students, alumni and neighbors from the Lewisburg community. A nice grouping of truly concerned

individuals, but not a representative group of all of the concerns on this campus.

Where are the throngs of students that paraded around campus last semester? Where are those that marched

on the Academic Quad or compiled reports on the “isms” of our flawed system? Have you forgotten the cause

that you were fighting for?

After a full house in Vaughan Literature Auditorium last semester, fewer than a dozen members of the

faculty are involved in TIP. Where has the concern of the faculty gone? What happened to their genuine effort to

“improve” our University

) Inaction, they must know, speaks for itself.

Most faculty don’t want their hands sullied by such work. “If it can’t be my way, I will have no part,” they

are saying. They have washed their hands of the problems and their concerns with our social-residential system.

Thcy have given up and moved on

What then are we Ieft with? What is TIP? TIP is made up of the few, only the most concerned. Those will-

ing to offer their time and input on an issue that should be very dear to our community. But without all compo-

nents of our community represented, without all of the data and points of view available, how can TIP be

expected to satisfy all of those who are and will be affected?

Instead of becoming involved, many students and faculty have tumed a blind eye. Instead of working

within the system to cffect change, they have chosen not to participate, leaving the task of recreating a social/

residential system at Bucknell to the mason and her bricks.

Open letters to the Bucknell communit

Senior questions G

I really appreciated getting
the letter concerning the Senior
Gift Drive. I’m glad to hear some-
body is doing something for Buck-
nell. If I were to give money to this
wonderful cause, what in the world
would it be spent on? What’s the
purpose of this Gift Drive? Who’s
going to benefit, and in what ways?
How is this a class project, and why
should I contribute? I think that you
did not include very vital aspects of
this campaign in your recruitment
letter. I will let you know that with-
out this information I see no reason
at all why I should even consider
helping or contributing to this
effort.

Why did your letter state that

a stecring committee composed of
15 classmates has been established?
There are only 12 listed on the
sheet that was included with your
letter.

Besides, | think that the
wording of your letter needed to be
more carefully written: “While
financial contributions are an inte-
gral aspect of this program...” If the
financial contributions are not the
primary aspect of this program,
then what is happening to the
money? I’m sorry to be so critical
of your letter, but after reading it, it
has not informed me of why I
should get involved. It only tells
me why I shouldn’t be involved.

Michael Klemen ’91
September 7, 1990

Dear Mike:

I would like to express my
appreciation for your letter regard-
ing the Senior Gift Drive. The
questions that you have addressed
in your letter are legitimate con-
cerns that many seniors must be
asking themselves when they hear
about this project. I trust that this
letter will provide a better under-
standing of the Senior Gift Drive
and its extraordinary value to the
University and local communities.

The Senior Gift Drive has
become an annual tradition at
Bucknell. It was first established 22
years ago when the Class of 1968
raised $12,000 in a 10-year pro-
gram. At that time, all the money
donated was placed in a holding
fund. During the 10th year reunion,
the class voted on a tangible gift to
be donated to Bucknell in the name
of their class.

Since then, although the tra-
dition has remained, the program
itself has undergone several
changes. In 1989, the designation
of the gift changed. Rather than
placing our money in a holding
fund, it will be given to the Annual
Giving Program. The money that is
pledged annually will be spent
annually. We are now able to
choose how our money is spent and
to see the immediate results of our
gifts.

Our donations can be allo-
cated to any of four funds: The

Annual Fund, The Association For
The Arts, The Bison Club, and the
Engineering Fund. The Annual
Fund is used to meet the pressing
needs of the University. Money
donated to this fund goes toward
maintaining the University’s prop-

ift Drive,
chairman Daniels responds

Dear Chris:

erty and facilities, scholarship
funds, or the addition of computers
around campus. The Association
For The Arts provides funding for
the performing arts endowment,
gallery exhibits, the poetry pro-
gram, or any concert offered to the
University and local communities.
The Bison Club provides money
for Bucknell’s athletic programs. It
goes toward athletic facilities and
the modern equipment available to
students free of charge, recruiting,
and team travel. Those who choose
to donate to this fund may specify
that their money goes to a specific
sport. For example, if I want to
donate to women’s soccer, I may
do so. The Engincering Fund is
used to update and improve the
College of Engineering. The ficld
of engineering is constantly chang-
ing and new equipment must be
purchased to maintain the high
quality of education in the depart-
ment. The money that we pledge
and eventually donate over the next
five years will be factored into the
budget of the fund we specify.

On a more personal note,
Bucknell University has provided
us with an outstanding education.
We will always cherish the friend-
ships we’ve made, as well as the
opportunities for personal growth
and achievement which Bucknell
has provided us. To Michael and
the rest of my classmates, I hope
I’ve provided an adequate explana-
tion of the Senior Gift Drive and
trust that you will give back to a
place that gave you so much.

Freshman speaks out
on sexism and racism

Dear Editor:

Here we are at Bucknell Uni-
versity in the year 1990; going into
the twenty-first century, and we are
still perpetrating racism and sex-
ism. I thought that the reason we
came to this fine institution was to
get the best education possible, so
that our generation could make a
difference.

Maybe at this point I need to
define “Education.” The American
Heritage Dictionary says that to
educate is ““(1) To provide with esp.
formal schooling; teach. (2) To
stimulate or develop the mental or
moral growth of.”

Let me also define the word
moral: “(1) Of or concerned with
the discernment or instruction of
what is good and evil. (2) Being or
acting in accordance of good
behavior. (3) Arising from con-
science. (4) Having psychological
rather than tangible effects.”

We came here to learn how
to become the next leaders of this
country, but the behaviors and atti-
tudes we display are that of ignor-
ant people. The following examples
will depict what I am referring to.
The majority of the students, Amer-
ican and foreign, walk past each
other for three and four years with-
out giving each other a “smile” or
even saying “hello.” Do you think

this is leadership material? In the
cafeteria, we sit at the same tables
with each other and rudely exclude
other races and sexes of people
from joining into general conversa-
tions. Do you think this is leader-
ship material? We purposely refuse
to give eye contact to those who are
making an cffort to be friendly or
to speak, pretending that they are
not there or that we don’t see them.
When you do things like that, it
shows how ersatz you really are,
and it burns the hell out of me.

Tam a Freshman here at

Bucknell University, and on many
occasions I have been madc to feel
like I did not belong because of my
race and sometimes because of my
gender. There is a perpetuating dis-
play of separatism on this campus
that needs to cease immediately.
This is not adult behavior, nor is it
the behavior of any person who is
learning to become a professional
in any field. The only thing that
you will learn from this type of
behavior is how to become a good
twenty-first century bigot.

My tuition is the same as
everyone else here. My class
assignments are made the same as
everyone else here, and my goals
are the same as everyone else here,
that is to get “my degree.” We do
not have to love cach other, but we
must respect cach other, and live
together while we are here.

It is possible for me to learn
from you, and for you to leam from
me. Do not let old attitudes and lics
stop our “growth.” We can take a
better quality of life to our new
communities when we leave here if
we Start now. Let go of the fear and
labels; let us get to know each other
and share our experience, strength
and hope with each other.

It is not necessary to act
superior, or think of yourself as
being superior, to feel good about
yourself. Let us all show some
human kindness toward each other.
Then go out into the world and

make a difference. We are the peo-
ple who have the opportunity to
make sexism and racism a thing of
the past. So please, listen to your
conscience; if you don’t have one,
try some of my suggestions and
you will develop one. I implore
you, to let the buck of hatred and
indifference stop here.

Bison

By Peter Lalos and Marc Haimes

Here I am sedately standing in line waiting to
be fed while making sure no one from the clevator
tries to sleaze in without wailing; and you know,
there is something about owning an ID card that
really scares me. Of course I have a lot of time to
contemplate the matter now because this particular
caf line seems to be moving along with the same
rapid momentum as Great Aunt Agnus (the one
with the walker) the time I tricd to help her across
Route 70. . . But that incident happened a long time
ago, and the Mack truck company did scttle out of
court. I just wish I hadn’t Ieft my key chain with the
handy card holder attachment in the emergency
room that day, because later on at dinner I discov-
ered I was missing something very, very impor-
tant......CWindchimes and flashback theme).

So there we are in line at the caf discussing
schedules and making conspicuous glances at this
one girl who was so hot that the other day at Play-
fair, she reccived a standing ovation without even
requesting onc. At last the time came for me to
present my vital card, so it could be run through that
litle slider thingee. Right pocket empty, Icft
pocket... . No, that’s my Bison Beverage Buster;
it’s not here! I’ve lost my student I.D. (the first four
notes of Becthoven’s fifth strike in the
background)!

I pleasantly explained my situation to Bertha,
the jolly woman working the machine, while my
Playfair scope rolled her eyes and resorted to perus-
ing her “What’s Happening” for the third time. I
politely asked Bertha if just this once, considering I
was on a 7-3 meal plan, she could be so kind as to
Ict me pass by. Well, Bertha looked at me as if I had
neglected to place my tray in every second bin on
the conveyor belt, and coldly stated that if I didn’t
have my ID, she needed cash. Otherwise I should
quit holding up the line and get lost.

Me: (reaching into pocket): Will I get the
money back?”

Bertha: (sighing): Do you know your social
security number?

Me: (shifting nervously): Well uh. . . 215-
11... 215-11... kind of forgot it, but I'll still get
my moncy back, right?

Bertha: (after two minutes of hysterical
laughter): Not.

Humbled, I handed over all my moncy

Tales

Wednesday night showing of “Steel Magnolias”),
slouched through the door, and took the first drip-
ping wet tray that popped up. . . a RED one (Bee-
thoven’s fifth is again heard off in the distance).

I quickly began piling food on my tray in an
effort to catch up to my group. You know, for six
bucks you would think they’d Iet me get stuffed
shells AND “chicken” nuggets at the same time.
After deciding on the shells and taking a small salad
with Icttuce, ham, and tomato, but no cheese, I
grabbed two or three dozen shot-glass size drinking
cups and proceeded to fill them with various juices
and sodas (its always a culture shock going home
for the holidays and having to drink just one bever-
age out of one normally-sized container). Then I
picked up my utensils along with fifty or sixty nap-
kins and went over to the salad dressing bar. You
ever wonder why they have a salad dressing bar, but
no salad bar? I tried to get close enough to the
“light” Italian dressing (or was that chocolate
sauce? I never can tell) to scoop some on my salad
without making a mess; unfortunately some jerk
had plopped a huge tray of food down on the ledge
right by the dressing bins and gone off in search of
an extra pat of butter, blocking everyone’s access to
the dressing/chocolate sauce (I’m still not sure yet).

After a few minutes of contorting my body
into various positions in vain efforts to get at the
ladle, I gave up and went to sit down. But WHAT’S
THIS?!? WHERE THE HELL DID MY FRIENDS
GO, WHERE ARE THEY?!?! I clutched my tay,
eyes scarching wildly, as millions of people turned
to note my lost expression and the fact that I was. . .
ALONE! Okay, keep calm, start walking down an
aisle, and LOOK like you know where you're
going; keep an car out for them in case they’re call-
ing me. 1 CAN’T FIND THEM!!! God, I must look
SO stupid right now...

I was squinting so hard during this futile
search for my friends that I failed to notice another
tray-carrying student who had also been ditched. He
was trying to break the land speed record in circling
the perimeter of the caf, praying that his friends
(who were already cutting into their cream of broc-
coli soup) would notice him. He didn’t sce me
either. Unknowingly, I backed toward him... Una-
ware, he came directly at me. Then it happened, I

Environmental problems
need more than rhetoric

By Mary Smolka

Earlicr this summer, I was
flipping around the channels on the
T.V., and came across a rather
interesting program on VHI1. It
wasn’t a program, rcally—more
like a thirty minute political com-
mercial. Clips of stars talking about
the environment were mixed in
with pictures of oil spills, contami-
nated beaches and smog. Every few
minutes you were told to “Vote
against pollution. Vote for the Big
Green.”

At first, I was glad to sce that
stars were
encouraging
people to exer-
cise their right
to vote. For
whatever _rea-
son, people look
up to singers
and actors, and
trust them more
than they trust the ordinary Joe. I
was heartened by the fact that these
stars would use their fame and rec-
ognition to encourage civic
responsibility

But the more I watched, the
more disappointed I became. This
was not an intelligent, political dis-
course—it was an appeal to your
emotions, plain and simple. This is
fine if you’re picking out china pat-
terns, but when it come to dealing
with highly complex issues such as
the environment, a simple “We’re
good, you’re bad” isn’t going to do
anyone any good.

Who among us is going to
stand up and say “I love pollution!
Soil my beaches! Destroy my
lungs! Build a toxic waste dump in
my backyard! Please!” No one, of
course. So, we’re agreed. Pollution
is bad, clean is good. Where do we
go from there?”

That’s the question this pro-
gram failed to answer, except to
say “Vote for the Big Green.” And
this wasn’t much of an answer

Parent attacks University’s administration

Dear President Sojka:

This letter is being addressed
to you as you have made it very
clear, over the past four ycars, that
you are the sole responsible person
on the Bucknell campus for any
and all matters
pertaining to
academic excel-
lence, social
life, tenure and
promotion, fund
raising, ad nau-
seam. In my
opinion, the uni-
versity would
have been better
served if you had persevered mag-
nificently at the traditional role of a
college president: a fund raiser. No,
you have to become embroiled in a
tenure dispute with the Economics
Department. Your redeeming grace
is that you appear to be an advocate
for the student as opposed to the
ball and chain that is your Vice
President for Student Life, Dr.
Jacobsen.

My son, Brian I. Caudill, was
a mid-year graduate of Bucknell
University. The diploma states Jan-
uary 13, 1990. I want to heartily
thank you for the over-Iengthy lead
time you gave to RSVP a gradua-
tion reception with your highness
and other, I assume, equally
socially elevated personages. I
think it was brilliant beyond mag-
nificence your choice of a week-
day evening, an evening that a not-
so-wealthy working parent paying
for tuition could find a burden to
attend. Knowing the pitiful cndow-
ment that Bucknell is heir to, I trust

that the tum-out was small enough
to avoid unnecessary expense.

On June 3, 1990, my son, his
mother and I attended the formal
graduation ceremony from your
ennui encrusted academic halls and
its accompanying cooperative plan-

SL

Am | proud that my son has graduated from
Bucknell University? Yes, proud that he

survived...

—

ning for the social/academic future
of its students.

Those “students” it came to
be more obvious as time passed
from matriculation to graduation
secmed to consist of trustecs,
administrative officials, faculty,
and the occasional idealistic and
naive real student. Unfortunately
you all appear, in writing, to have
been products of poorly taught cur-
ricula consisting, solely, of Sociol-
ogy, Psychology, and Management
101 and only of the introductory
chapter (singular) at that!

Am I sick that I spent
approaching $60,000 to read in var-
ious university publications that
you (administration, trustees,
faculty) can look no further than
the preservation of the status quo
(your own turf, everyone else be

damned) and any deviation is tanta-
mount to blasphemy because you
have advanced degrees? Yes. I feel
so fortunate that I quit teaching on
the college level 18 years ago,

because if Bucknell is any example,
the level of higher education and its
administration and teaching and
respect for its students has
regressed and, judging from the
pathetic attempt at a graduation cer-
emony, that fine art has made no
advances either

Am!
proud that my
son has gradu-
ated from Buck-
nell University?
Yes, proud that
he survived the
bullshit, lack of
cooperation on
the departmental

and administrative level wherein
compromise only exists for the
privileged (read degreed, tenured,
titled), not for the student’s best
educational
opportunity.
Check with
Dean Pyper and
see if a curricu-
lum change in
the Political
Science Depart-
ment did not
force upperclassmen into repetition
because there can be no compro-
mise. Just possibly, the Dean will
remember my son’s rather irate
reaction.

Will I recommend Bucknell
University to a future applicant?
Only if he/she is majoring in engi-
nccring and even then I wish him/

her luck with the dead wood, the
tenured, the self-satisfied, the lazy,
the “those who cannot, teach.”

As a professional theatre per-
son, I sce you have, in the Weis
Center, a lovely mausoleum with
no one to tell you how to make it
work, artistically. Ah “‘appear-
ances;” they shall substitute for
content and viability. How very
typical of Bucknell University. I
pray for you.

If I could have one basic fer-
vent prayer answered for all higher
education that I have encountered
as a teacher, student, parent-plcase,
God, let’s not be concerned with
appearances but with does the facil-
ity, the program, the teaching (not
percentage of Ph.D.s on the
faculty) WORK?

So, what do I want from this

ED

Unfortunately you all appear, in writing, to
have been products of poorly taught

curricula....

SNS

letter? I want no more communica-
tions from Bucknell University. I
want no more “money begs.” (Less
than two weeks from graduation I
receive a “beg” from something
called Bucknell Parents or some
such organization.) I’m afraid the
notion of having to continue to pay
Bucknell for the “privilege” of my

cither, since the program never
mentioned exactly what the “Big
Green” was, or what it entailed.

This lack and distortion of
facts scemed to characterize the
entire program. I remember onc
spokesman saying in his “your-
children-will-die-of-cancer-if-you-
don’t-do-this” voice, “Remember,
if you’re over 21, vote for the “Big
Green.” Over 21? As I recall, 18
year olds were given the right to
vote almost a generation ago. Why
should we trust their facts on envi-
ronmental damage when they can’t
even get the voting age right?

...when it comes to dealing with highly com-
plex issues such as the environment, a sim-
ple “We’re good, you’re bad”

do anyone any good.

“It’s time to stop listening to
the so-called ‘experts’ and start tak-
ing care of the environment our
own way,” Jane Fonda suggested. I
would like to suggest to her that
onc of the truc hallmarks of a wise
person is knowing when onc is in
over one’s head. Yes, there are
many things that ordinary citizens
can do that will make the world a
cleaner place; however, many of
the problems we face are complex
and technical, and require a certain
amount of technical knowledge to
even understand, much __ less
unravel.

But that’s not what the pro-

isn’t going to

ducers of this show would have you
think. Vote for the “Big Green” and
all your environmental problems
will be solved.

To really clean up the earth,
we’re going to nced a lot more than
empty rhetoric. We're going to
need action. Co-operative action.
Instead of telling people to go it on
their own, celebrities should
encourage the public to work with
the scientists and engincers who
have the background to understand
the technical effects of pollution.

Pollution became such a
problem in the first place because
.of a lack of

information.
Nobody knew
that prolonged
exposure to
chemicals could
be harmful.
Nobody knew
that unlined
landfills could
leak contaminants to surrounding
groundwater. Nobody knew that
there was a threshold amount of
garbage the world could absorb
before it began fighting back.

Lack of information and
knowledge caused the problem of
environmental damage. It is only
by increasing our knowledge and
disseminating our information to all
sectors that we can meet the chal-
lenges the environment presents us.

lis as an environmental engineer.

Freshman
Forum

By Richard Polt and James Joseph

A wise man once said that a body whose voice remains
unheard for too long will inevitably lose its power of speech. In giv-
ing the freshmen a forum through which they can be heard we have
chosen not to remain silent. This is the first of many commentaries
which will be published weekly under a designated freshmen col-
umn. In addition to expressing our personal opinions, we hope to

articulate the views of the Cl
As Bucknell University f

s of 1994.
$ a new decade, a plethora of poli-

cies and ideas will be considered and actually implemented.
Immersed in this flux of ideas and opinions, we feel that we are a
“transition” class subject to the decisions of the administration and
the upperclassmen. Upon the announcement of new proposals and
plans, the students who compose the Class of 94 cannot be caught
tonguc-ticd. It is true that freshmen lack the insight and experience
to change campus policy. However, in an environment where we
total onc quarter of the undergraduate population, our voice needs to

be heard.

By varying the subject matter and tone of this column from
weck to week, we hope to cover many aspects of campus life.
Among these topics are student parking, the lack of freshman auto-
mobile privileges, the Greek system, a§ well as issues outside of
Bucknell. The intent of our column is not to condemn school related
issues, but to critique them in a constructive fashion

Though we have been here for only two wecks, we have
already found a host of topics on which we are cager to write. If
there are any particular issucs which you would like us to address,
please contact cither of us through The Bucknellian. We would
appreciate any feedback you wish to share during the coming
wecks. Our long journey together begins now.

Improvisational artist holds workshop

By Ashley Shrader

This week the Bucknell
Department of Theatre and Dance
and the Bucknell Association for
the Arts hosted guest improvisa-
tional artist Richard Bull to help
kick off the departments’ new
Improvisational/Movement for
Actors course. Bull has spent the
past week working with the Buck-
nell Dance Company and other
theatre and dance students in com-
position, jazz, modern dance, and
TH393 Seminar in Contemporary
Performance. The grand finale of
this residency will be a joint
improvisational dance concert with
the five-member Richard Bull
Dance Theatre (Cynthia Novack,
George Russell, Vicki Kurtz, Sally
Souders, and Richard Bull). The
concert will be held in Tustin Stu-
dio Theatre today, at 5:00 p.m.
(admission is free). Bull also
worked with the Bucknell Dance
Company and utilized improvisa-
tional techniques which will lead to
a piece slated for the company’s
Fall Dance Concert

Richard Bull began his
professional life as a jazz pianist,
and then turned to dance as a per-
former, choreographer, and direc-
tor. He has also worked as an edu-
cator at New York University,
SUNY Brockport, and Wesleyan
University. The Richard Bull
Dance Theatre is a company of
dancer/actors who work with chore-
ographic and theatrical improvisa-
tion. In daily rehearsals movement
ideas and textual concepts are
explored, developed, and eventu-
ally organized into scenarios which
become repertory works. Spontane-
ity and invention continue even
when a work is “finished,” and no
two concert performances of the
same work are identical. The pro-
cess is very much like the process
used in jazz music. Audiences
share in the exciting immediacy of
this creative, interactive experi-
ence. So, if you are not participat-
ing on stage, you can still become
an integral part of this unique per-
formance today at 5:00 p.m. in Tus-
tin Studio Theatre.

Dante Painters featured in Gallery

The works of five major
American abstract painters will be
exhibited in Bucknell University’s
Center Gallery Sept. 14 to Oct. 28.

“Primal Denouements: The
Dante Painters,” features the works
of Linda Gentile, Peter Pinchbeck,
Richard Pugliese, Edwin Ruda and
Joe Walentni, artists who mect
weekly at New York’s Cafe Dante.

According to Robert Metz-

ger, Center Gallery director, the
five artists have been influenced by
the philosophy of French writer
Merlcau-Ponty, who saw painting
as an expression of vision and
existence.

“Merleau-Ponty was a phi-
losopher who wrote that painters
see not only the object they’re
painting, but they see themselves
while they’re painting,” said Metz-

Our Man-Made Hell

A rock, a piece of Earth a piece of time,

Electrons spinning round, form bonds so close,
Those wondrous mountains seem to us sublime,
While released tension formed that sight beauteous.

The atoms search for peace of balanced state,
But never find it, hence we have our Earth,
‘Where some to peace and happiness relate,
But most never discover beauty 's worth.

Music sets the mood of life in doubt,
Taming temperamental minds of men,
Using nature's peaceful calming clout,
To sooth the spirit time and time again.

Nature's breach of contract is man's fluke,

We bite the hand which fed us yesterday,

‘We have our peace which comes from fear of nuke,
While thriving forests turn to stumps of grey.

Greenhouse comes from human's greedy need,
Our Lust was god, and now we pay the price,
We've grown.this vengeful man created weed,
To careless humans, nature's not so nice.

Synthetic drugs, granted cure disease,

But Kill our youth in other forms like crack,

‘The fit survive while others fall to knees,

And rot their limbs strung out on drug's weak rack.

Roach infested minds I call a plague,

A plague to clean corruption from our land,

You choose sham Hell, but soon for peace you il beg,
I teach that peace, to learn you'll hold my hand.

Struggling field hockey looks to improve

By Scooter Van Kirk and Julie
McCausland
Staff Writers

The Bucknell women’s field
hockey team this year will feature
an extraordinary amount of youth,
retuming no players with more than
two seasons of college experience.
But last year’s graduation did little
to dissolve the Lady Bison’s
nucleus of starters, co-captained by
Jeanette Aurand ‘92 and Meghan
Clark ‘92. Bucknell will also be
supplemented with seven talented
freshman, many of whom will be
major contributors this fall.

La

The Lady Bison will look improve
on last year’s record when they fin-
ished with a 7-11-2 mark, but fol-
lowing an 0-3 start they hope to
turn it around this weekend.

The Bucknell women opened
their 1990 campaign September 4,
suffering a 2-1 defeat against the
Michigan State Spartans. The
majority of the game focused upon
the mid-field, where the play of
both teams which were very evenly
matched. The contest was scoreless
until late in the first half, when
Bucknell’s Sue Wells ‘93 scored
with a forceful drive to put the
Lady Bison on top 1-0, a lead they

carried into halftime.

Although Bucknell played
impressively to start the second
half, they could not convert any
offensive attacks into scores. Mich-
igan State tumed the momentum
into their favor by hounding the
Lady Bison with their tenacious
style of play. With ten minutes
remaining, the Spartans got the
break they were looking for. State’s
Sharon Hill pushed her pass across
the goalmouth to teammate Brigid
Kiley, who followed through for
the goal, knotting the game at 1-1.
The Spartans quickly capitalized
again on a shocked Bucknell squad,
as Lisa Besser shuffled one past
Lady Bison goalie Danielle Ward
“93 in a chaotic moment following
a corner pass for what turned out to
be the winning score.

The Lady Bison, however,
quickly regrouped and pushed the
ball deep into the Michigan State
zone with a resurgent offensive
counterattack. Less than three min-
utes remained when the Spartans
jeopardized their lead by giving up
a penalty stroke to Bucknell.
Sweeper Katrina Mueller ‘93 aimed
for the corner and let go on one her
patented rocket shots, but the shot
carcened just outside the post ena-

The women’s volicyball tcam
is putting the frustration that went
along with last year’s 2-26 overall
record behind them, and they are
bringing a positive attitude along
with a new coach and new league
into the 1990 season.

Coach Cindy Opalski, who
in four years at Clarion University
compiled an overall record of 92-
46 and one league championship,
will be at the helm replacing former
coach, Vicki May.

The Lady Bison will also be
participating in the Patriot League
this year as it begins its first full
season of play.

“We playcd most of the
teams that are in the conference last
year,” said Kara Forosisky ‘92.
“We know we’re a good team and

we should do real well in the
league.”

Coach Opalski has a young
but experienced squad, as the Lady
Bison lost only one player to gradu-
ation last year. Among the starters
for Opalski this season are co-
captains Kristin Colbert ‘91 at mid-
dle hitter and Forosisky at outside
hitter.

“As captains Kristin and I try
to set an example on the court and
in practice. We serve as role mod-
els for the other players and we just
try and keep everyone motivated
and focused,” said Forosisky.

The other starters include
seticr Dee Scinta ‘92, who was
named to the Colonial League All-
Tournament team last fall, Kath-
Icen Sullivan ‘92 at middle hitter,
Sarah Mesaros ‘93 at outside hitter,
and Mary Jordan ‘93 at right side
hitter. When the Lady Bison need

The Bucknellian

An armchair QB’s guide to the NFL

By Mark Griffith
and Eric Smith
Staff Writers

Can the San Francisco 49ers three-peat as world chémpions is the
most debated question among football fans as the 1990 NFL season
begins. Another hot topic is whether an AFC team can even compete in a
Super Bowl--let alone win it. This season Promises to be interesting as
these and other developments will be focused upon in the following five
months of football action. Parity appears Prominent this ycar, as we sec
noteworthy improvements from the Jets, Chargers, Buccaneers, Falcons
and Lions. So without further ado, we present our 1990 fearless football
forecast (teams listed in projected order of finish):

When looking at the AFC East, one has to wonder how the Buffalo
Bills will not end up on top. In what has to be the weakest division in the
league, Buffalo should cruise to its third consccutive division title. Corne-
lius Bennett, Bruce Smith and Shane Conlan Icad a particularly strong
defensive unit. The only question is whether or not quarterback Jim Kelly
will live up to the superstar potential that has haunted him throughout his
NFL career. The Miami Dolphins only hope is that Dan Marino can aver-
age five touchdowns per game, because this defense will give up at least
four. Without Eric Dickerson for the first six weeks of the season, the
Indianapolis Colts will be lucky to win two games during this stretch.
Indy will have to rely on its above average defense, and hope for a quick
professional adjustment by rookie quarterback Jeff George. Will Blair
Thomas be the New York Jets savior? Not with this offensive line. But his
addition, as well as off season coaching changes could make the Jets a
-500 tcam. The offensively inept New England Patriots, on the other hand,
made no substantial moves since last year’s dismal season, and .500 is but
a distant dream.

The AFC Central promises to be a Dawg fight with all four teams
possessing Icgitimate shots at playoff berths. The Cleveland Browns
should vault back to the top of this division on tough defense and an
explosive offense. Bernie Kosar, if healthy, has several weapons in agile
receiver Reggie Langhorne and running backs Kevin Mack and Eric Met-
calf. One can also expect to sce the Cincinnati Bengals in the thick of
things at scason’s end. James Brooks is a proven runner on a powerful
offensive squad that will sce wild card action in January. Though the
Pittsburgh Stcclers and Houston Oilers cach have wild card chances, both
will nced offensive help. The defense-oricnted Steclers continuc to have a
mediocre quarterback controlling the offense. The running duo of Merrill
Hoge and Tim Worley wiil need All-Pro performances to compensate for
Bubbyball. Jack Pardee’s run-and-shoot in Houston must mature before
serious division hopes can be considered.

The AFC West poses a problem, as we have a split decision: one
vote goes to the Kansas City Chicfs. Last year’s conference- leading
defense will pave the way for Marty Schotcnhcimer’s gallant retum to
post-season play. The tandem of rookic Percy Snow and All-Pro Derrick
Thomas should give the Chiefs that distinction once again. Although the

| offense is hampered by an average quarterback, the hard running of Chris-

tian Okoye will provide the needed offensive punch. Our other prognosti-
cator goes with the Los Angeles Raiders. The Silver and Black, under
coach Art Shell, will play old Raider defense, no matter what city they’re
in. Combined with the likes of Bo Jackson and the speed of Willie Gault
and Tim Brown, the offense will be dynamite. A strong ycar out of Jay
Schrocder is all that is needed to Iead L.A. to the top of the division. The
Denver Broncos must wonder what it takes to win the big one. Low
morale will be their downfall. Behind the offensive leadership of John
Elway and the help of Mile High Stadium, the Broncos will look to a
wild-card spot. The San Diego Chargers look to youth in a scason that
may hold many surprises. A solid defense lead by lincbacker Billy Ray
Smith and rookie lineman Junior Scau may ambush unsuspecting oppo-
nents. Offensively the Chargers are led by QB Billy Joe Tolliver, but with
a weak offensive linc, scoring will be tough. The Scattle Scahawks are a
tcamsinking fast. A poor offense and a pitiful defense will result in a
nightmare. Look for three wins as a milestone.

The NFC East is always a tough division with fierce rivalrics,
Look for the New York Giants to reign supreme. Any defense that has
Lawrence Taylor, Pepper Johnson, and Carl Banks will dominate a
game. Combined with the crafty wisdom of Phil Simms and good look-
ing running of rookie Rodncy Hampton, the Giants offense can com-
pete with any team. Strong offensive line play will result in a Giants
division crown. On the heals of the Giants will be the Washington Red-
skins. QB Mark Rypien could blossom into one of the leagues best with
the help of wide-outs Gary Clark, Art Monk, and Ricky Sanders. The
defense, behind veterans Wilbur Marshall and Charlcs Mann, appears
strong enough to stop anyone. Look for a strong showing come play-off
time. The Philadelphia Eagles, though remaining competitive this sca-
son, will encounter some difficulties. A strong pass rush behind line-
man Reggie White cannot overcome problems in the secondary. Look
for Randall Cunningham to be productive when flushed from the
pocket, but contain Randall and you contain the offense. The Dallas
Cowboys and Phoenix Cardinals will battle for basement rights. Dallas
needs two more years and six more draft picks before a winning season
is in sight, while the Cardinals best hope might be for another change of
scenery.

In the NFC Central the Green Bay Packers should pull out ahead.
With a little Majik, the Packer offense will role. Add to this the NFC
leading receiver in Sterling Sharpe, and the offense will have the punch
needed to win, Linebacker Tim Harris anchors a good defense that can
stop the run. If the defensive line can apply some pressure on opposing
quarterbacks, look out for the Pack. The Minnesota Vikings, Chicago
Bears, Detroit Lions, and Tampa Bay Buccancers all pose a minor
threat to Green Bay. The Vikings have become the team with all the
potential but no production. Run Herschel Walker from the I-formation
and the Vikings might surprise people. The Bears are in need of a quar-
terback. Jim Harbaugh won’t cut it, but running backs Neal Anderson
and rookie Johnny Bailey might help. In addition, Dan Hampton’s ten
knee operations can no longer anchor the defense, Barry Sanders and
the run and shoot could make things interesting in Motown, but they are
still lacking the defensive talent to talk of post-scason Ppossibilitics. It is
a crucial year for Vinny Testaverde to prove he can play in the NFL.
Another year of experience for Testaverde and the addition of rookie
Keith McCants make the Bucs an improved tcam, but not quite playoff
material.

Most fans attention will be focused on the NFC West this season
as the San Francisco 49crs attempt for their third consecutive Super
Bowl championship. How can one pick against them? Not only do they
field one of the most talented tcams in the league, but their discipline
and sense of team play is unparalleled. The leadership of Joe Montana
will give the Niners the division title once again. Early season injurics
will keep the Los Angeles Rams from winning the division this year,
but they are an assured wild card team and will be extremely tough in
the playoffs. The Ram offensive line should give quarterback Jim Ever-
ett the time he needs to connect with deep threats Flipper Anderson and
Henry Ellard. No clear sense of leadership will haunt the New Orleans
Saints this season. How long will the unproven John Fourcade lead the
offense? A quarterback controversy will develop between Bobby
Hebert and Fourcade if the Saints do not win carly. The biggest prob-
lem facing Jerry Glanville and his Atlanta Falcons is their presence in
the NFC West. A definitcly improved tcam, but still a cellar dweller.

This brings us to Super Bowl XXV. Here are our individual
predictions:

Eric sees the Rams over the Chicfs.

Mark thinks the Giants over the Raiders,

two pass receptions—a_ 13-
yarder and a 44-yarder. He then
opened up the second half with
an explosive 75-yard kickoff
return for his eleventh career
touchdown with the Bison. A
three-time letterman for Buck-
nell, Erb has caught 63 passes
for 1162 yards during his distin-
guished carcer with the Bison.

Cross-country to face
Connecticut tomorrow

By Jennifer Walsh

The Bucknell men’s cross-
country tcam placed first in the Sep-
tember 8 Lafayette Invitational
Tourney, a five-mile race in which
Bucknell accumulated 40 points and
defeated LaSalle by two points.
Thomas Wuchenich ‘92, Judd
Jarden ‘93, David Howard ‘93, Tom
Eagleson ‘93, and Todd Vincent ‘92
were the five top finishers for the
Bison. Wuchenich placed fourth,
just 30 seconds behind LaSalle’s
Schwind, who won the meet in
26:18. Bucknell’s Jarden, Howard,
Eagleson, and Vincent came in sev-
enth, cighth, tenth, and cleventh,
respectively.

LaSalle finished a close sec-
ond in this preliminary meet, tally-
ing 42 points as the Explorers
placed two of the top three runners.
However, some of Bucknell’s Iead-
ing runners did not compete in this
preliminary race.

Next weck should provide a
clear perspective on the scason’s
Outlook, as the men’s tcam will
compete in their first official meet

of the scason, against Rutgers,
Manhattan, and Connccticut.

In running against a team as
strong as Connecticut, Bucknell
will face a tough test to increase its
167 dual-match consecutive win-
ning streak which dates back to
1974. The Bison’s 16-year stretch
is one of the most impressive in
the history of NCAA athletics.

The runners, however, don’t
anticipate to feel much pressure
due to “the streak.”

Norbert Berenyi ‘91
asscricd, “We'd like to keep the
streak going, but that won’t be
foremost on our minds. Everyone
will just be looking to run as well
as they possibly can.”

As far as strategy is con-
cerned, Berenyi said that the Bison
would “pretty much just be keying
in on U-Conn in general—not indi-
vidual runners.”

Tomorrow’s meet will also
mark the first race for the
woman’s cross-country team this
season. The women will compete
against teams from Connecticut,
Rutgers, and George Mason.

Tennis defeats UMBC

By Chris Mosunic

The yellow ball bounced in
Bucknell’s favor during the
women’s tennis match last Sunday,
at the University of Maryland Balti-
more County. UMBC was hounded
by Buckneli’s strong offense and
winning altitude

The Lady Bison crushed the
Opposition in 18 straight sets en
route to a 9-0 victory. In second-
singles, Kymm Carlson ‘94 cruised
to a 6-1, 6-0 win. Kim Thompson
‘93 also breezed through — her
fourth-singles match 6-1, 6-0.
Thompson and Carlson then

tcamed up to capture the first-
doubles match, once again by the
score of 6-1, 6-0.

To many of the players this
seemed to be a preliminary warm-
up to their big match against Army
tomorrow. As Elizabeth Murphy
commented, “The match was a big
confidence booster for us. Amy
will be tougher but we don’t know
exactly what to expect - this being
their first year with women’s tennis
as a varsity sport.”

The Bucknell football tcam

urday, as visiting Hofstra Icft

game with a 1-0 record, and a new

Maranzana commented, “We have
talent and ability, but not so much
that we can afford to make mis-
takes and still win.”

The Bison opened up the
game strongly as Craig Cavlovic

‘91 intercepted a pass by Rhory
Moss on Hofstra’s third play from
scrimmage. Bucknell capitalized
off the turnover, marching 47 yards
on five plays, culminating with a
13 yard pass from Todd Hatajik ’91
to Lester Erb ‘91.

On Hofstra’s next possession,
Bucknell again intercepted a Moss
pass. This time Mike Cramton ‘91
returned the pass 31 yards to the
Hofstra 17 yard line. This set up a
20 yard ficld goal by Todd Krutch-
koff ‘91 and the Bison stormed off
to a 10-0 Icad half way through the
first quarter. The Dutchmen, how-
ever, came back strong taking the
ensuing kickoff 77 yards for a
touchdown in just over three min-
utes, to knock the deficit down to

But that was not the end of
the scoring in this explosive first
quarter of football, as Bucknell
scored on the last play of the quar-
ter when Hatajik connected with
Erb for a 44 yard touchdown. The
extra point was blocked making the
score after the first 15 minutes of
play, 16-7 in favor of the Bison.

The second quarter opened
with a Hofstra touchdown, closing
the gap to 16-14. The remainder of
the quarter was extremely sloppy,
with a total of five tumovers, three
interceptions by Hatajik, and a fum-
ble and an interception by Hofstra.

Play picked up for Bucknell
to begin the second half, before
things started to fall out of reach.

bounce here or there can often
make the difference between vic-
tory and defeat. Coach Reynolds’
1990 team is taking this scason one
game at a time, in hopes that the
ball will bounce in their favor.

The Bison seemingly have a
nice mix of youth and experience to
Start Out this scason.

The team is led by senior ti-
captains Terry Pelino, Brandon
Poe, and Kirk Loric. Lorie and Poe
should provide defensive stability
to an otherwise young and inexperi-
enced backficld.

“IT am concerned about our
defense,” says Reynolds. “We need
to climinate errors and minimize
menial mistakes.”

Yet, through three games to
date, the defense seems to be hold-
ing up well, achieving shutouts
over Dickinson College (1-0), Sus-
quchanna University (8-0), and
Temple University (1-0). Temple
Provided the most trying contest,
warranting Reynolds to describe
the game as “winning the hard
way.”

One strength the Bison seem
to be developing is their depth in
goal. Returning for Bucknell is
Scott Racck ‘91, who had five shut-
Outs for the team last ycar. Mark
Wriglcy ‘94 is also having an out-
standing fall while sceing plenty of
action in the net. Reynolds is giv-
ing them cqual time, and will Ict
the test of time dictate who will
remain as the keeper for the dura-
tion of the scason.

Pclino is the leader of a solid
midficld corps that has many
returning contributors. Reynolds is
optimistic about his midficlders,
and thinks they will be successful if
they “are consistent and keep the
game quick and simple.”

The offense is fronted by last
year’s scoring leader, Ken Gulick
“91. Gulick has already earned
Patriot League Player of the Week
honors this season for his hat trick
against Susquchanna. Backing him
is Chad Hellman ‘92 who had a
score in the Susquehanna game, as
well as the lone goal in the Dickin-

son contest.

Reynolds is concerned that
“sometimes we hold the ball too
long and fail to take advantage of
the opportunitics created by the
opponents’ mistakes.”

“As a team I feel that we are
mentally tough and can hold off
the pressure of a tight one gaol
game,” assesses Reynolds. “We
necd to keep fighting and play con-
sistently at a level better than our
opponents. I feel we can beat any
tcam on our schedule, but also, we
could lose to any team on the
schedule.”

Bucknell will be tested carly
in the fall campaign as they travel
for road games tomorrow at
Lehigh and Tuesday versus Drexcl

“These next six games arc
crucial for us,” insists Reynolds.
“We need to get off to a good
start.” So far, with a 3-0 record and
three shutouts under their belts, it
appears that the Bison are well on
their way.

After hosting the Annual

in addition to regular afternoon
workouts.

Bison quarterback Jeff Kelly ’92 rolls to his left in order to elude the Hofstra pass rush. Kelly injured his
shoulder late in the fourth quarter of the 42-29 loss to the Flying Dutchmen.

Erb began the third quarter by run-
ning back the opening kickoff 75
yards for his third touchdown of the
day. The kick return touchdown
was the first for the Bison since
Dan Scocca ‘91 returned one 84
yards versus Colgate in 1987.

The excitement was short-
lived, however, as Hofstra con-
verted on their next four posscs-
sions for three touchdowns and a
field goal, to open up a comfortable
36-22 lead. The quarter would end
with the same score, but not before
Hatajik would throw his fourth
interception and be replaced by Jeff
Kelly ‘92.

In the fourth quarter, Kelly,
in his second series, engineered a
73 yard drive in just two and a half
minutes. He was successful on 4 of

5 passcs in the drive, including a 40
yarder to David Berardinclli ‘93,
which sct up a touchdown of 6
yards to Matt Walsh ‘93. This
closed the gap to just seven points,
and with over ten minutes to play,
there still seemed to be hope for the
Bison

The hope was further intensi-
ficd when Bucknell stopped a Hof-
stra drive on their own four yard
line by recovering a fumble. The
hope ended shortly thereafter, when
Kelly threw an interception that
was returned 27 yards for a touch-
down to finish the scoring at 42-29.

A kcy to the outcome of the
game was how thoroughly the
Dutchmen outplayed Bucknell in
the second half. The Bison were
outscored 28-13. They were out-

rushed 124 yards to 17. In all,
Bucknell had 8 turnovers and
allowed 457 total yards.

When asked about the tumo-
vers, Maranzana stated, “There’s
no excuse. We just weren’t protect-
ing the ball.” On the subject of the
five interceptions he explained,
“We didn’t do a good job protect-
ing the quarterback. Our quarter-
backs were trying to make things
happen when theve wasn’t much
there.”

On Saturday the Bison will
travel to Lafayctte, attempting to
improve on their 0-1 record. Last
year, Bucknell defeated Lafayette
54-33 at home. This will be the first
conference matchup for the Bison
this year, and thcir first ever in the
newly formed Patriot !.cague.

Bucknell’s defense, shown here converging on a Susquehanna attacker, has performed admirably thus far
this season. In the Bison’s initial three wins, they have yet to be scored upon.

Intensity level high as
water polo starts season

‘92 and Chris Retzler ‘93 to pro-
vide veteran leadership. The
remainder of the squad showcases
promising freshmen and
newcomers.

The Bison regisiered strong
performances against the New
York Athletic Club A and B teams,
which are primarily composed of
Bucknell alumni. Later the Bison
played its most challenging game
against arch-rival and perennial
powerhouse Slippery Rock. The
standing-room-only crowd  pro-
vided Bucknell with tremendous
support, and despite losing 7-5, the
Bison were optimistic about their
chances in this weckend’s Eastern
League Tournament, held at the
U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis.

Kachmarik said that “the
guys were really up for the game

and turncd in a fine performance.”

As the top 16 teams of the
East will participate in the upcom-
ing tournament,  cighth-sceded
Bucknell looks to make a statement
against strong competition. The
Bison open against a tough Army
squad, and depending on the out-
come of the game, Bucknell may
face other Mid-Auantic rivals, such
as Iona and Navy.

Kachmarik has been pleased
with her team’s progress and deter-
mination thus far this scason,
stressing that “their attitude and
work desire are incredible. This is
the hardest working group I have
ever worked with at Bucknell.”

It appears this young polo
tcam has the intensity and dedica-
tion for completing a successful
season.

Bucknell Student Government President Dave Skena ‘92 debuts the
new Student Buying Card at Sunday’s BSG meeting.

Student buying card
unveiled by BSG

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

The Bucknell Student Gov-
emment, in cooperation with an
off-campus marketing firm, will
soon be distributing a Lewisburg

Discount Card to all members of

the Bucknell community. The card,
given free of charge to students,
faculty, staff and their families, will
entitle the bearer to various dis-
counts at local businesses which
have purchased space on the card.
Bucknell Student Government’s
distribution of the card brings
renewed attention to the Univer-
sity’s controversial sales and solici-
tation policy, since two Bucknell
students were denied University
permission to market a similar card
on campus last spring.

Dave Skena ’92, BSG presi-
dent, explained that V.I.P. Services,
a marketing firm, contacted the
businesses involved. The _ busi-
nesses pay a fee determined by the
size and location of their advertise-
ment on the card. Five percent of
all money collected from the busi-
nesses then goes to BSG, which

distributes the card on campus.
Skena said that the final amount
BSG will receive has not yet been
determined, pending a final
accounting by VIP. Services.
Skena also said “We don’t know
what we’re going to use [the funds]
for yet.” He went on to explain that
the primary purpose of the card is
not to generate additional BSG
funds, but to “provide a concrete,
tangible service to the University
community.”

Both Skena and John Dunlop,
dean of students, explained that the
card does not violate the sales and
solicitation policy, since the pro-
ceeds benefit BSG, and are not for
a student’s personal profit.

The current University sales
and solicitation policy states that,
“Except with written approval,
sales and solicitations on campus or
in residential units are prohibited.
Approval for sales and solicitations
must be obtained from the dean of
students.” Before the current policy
was adopted in 1985 student sales
and solicitations were permitted as

BSG votes to ban chalk writing
on University-owned property

Congress to reconsider resolution on Sunday

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

In a vote that may spark a
campus-wide debate on the issue of
first amendment rights, the Buck-
nell Student Government last Sun-
day approved a motion to recom-
mend that the University ban all
writing on its sidewalks. The
motion, passed by a vote of four-
teen to ten with three abstentions,
will be reconsidered this Sunday.
The motion to reconsider will be
the first item on the BSG’s agenda.

The author of the motion,
Keith Eisenstein '92, a class repre-
sentative to the BSG, stated that he
put forward the motion in order to
respond to what he perceived to be
a strong sentiment amongst the stu-
dent body against chalking on the
sidewalk.

Class Representative Brian
Selmeski ‘92, who led the opposi-
tion to the motion, stated that this
step encroaches dangerously on
first-amendment rights. “There

Bio building progress continues

second phase of new Science Complex is well underway

By Tara G. Gilligan

Scenes of construction next
to the year-old chemistry building
have hardly gone unnoticed by stu
dents in the first few weeks of
school. The construction site is the
location for the new $12 million
biology building set for completion
by the fall semester of next year.

The building, which will
actually be attached to the existing
chemistry building, is part of a
three stage project to update the
facilities of the science depart-
ments. Updated laboratories anc
research facilities to be used by
faculty and students and will be
located in this building.

“In a nutshell, the existing
quality of our biology facilities ha:
for years not kept pace with the
quality of faculty, the quality of the
students, and the quality of the pro-
gram. It was necessary to upgrade
the facility,” said Barry Maxwell,

Senior Gift Drive proceeds
amid growing concerns

By Travis Elliott
Staff Writer

With the kick off of this
year’s senior gift drive, some sen-
iors have expressed their discontent
with the university and their intent
not to contribute to the senior gift
drive. The goal for the senior class
of 1991 is to raise $115,000 and to
improve on the record of 77% sen-
ior participation. Seniors are being
asked to pledge $100 per year for
the next five years.

Maggy Rislow, assistant
director of annual giving, said,
“The percentage participation of
the senior class is the most impor-
tant aspect of the senior gift drive.
A number of corporations request
alumni participation percentages
from Universities; they don’t want
to donate to a University which is
not supported by its own alumni.”

Since 1987, the participation
percentages of seniors have fallen
from a high of 77% to only 64% in
1990; however, the total monetary
contributions from the classes have
been steadily rising from $85,253
in 1987 to $136,910 in 1990.

Rislow explained that
Bucknell has a well-developed sen-

ior gift drive compared to other uni-
versities. She also noted that other
universities have requested infor-
mation on Bucknell’s senior gift
drive so that they can emulate the
success of the program.

One disgruntled senior,
Michael Klemen ’91 contended that
tuition should cover the costs of
education, but he also said, “As a
student, I see what the University
could really use. Money does not
seem to be the correct band-aid.
The way that the senior gift drive is
organized, I don’t know where my
money is going or how it’s being
spent.”

Klemen also said that he
might feel more obligated to donate
if the university had a list of their
specific needs, and he could choose
to donate to a specific projects
which he would deem worthy.
Chris Daniels "91, chairman of the
senior gift drive, recanted that stu-
dents do have the option of ear-
marking their donation to one of
four existing funds.

The Annual Fund is the main,
all encompassing fund which
includes all academic departments
at Bucknell as well as financial aid.
In addition seniors can send their

contributions to the Bison Club, the
Association for the Arts, or the
Engineering Fund. The Bison Club
is an athletic fund which com
pletely subsidizes student use of
Bucknell’s gym facilities as well as
providing specific teams with addi-
tional monies. The Association for
the Arts goes to subsidize those
events which come to the Weis
Center, and finally, the Engineering
Fund pays for some of the expen-
sive equipment and higher salaries
which are characteristic of the engi-
neering department.

Rislow also said, “Very few
people really realize that alumni
subsidize every student that attends
Bucknell. Even without financial
aid, students only pay about 70% of
the actual costs of attending the
University, due to the generosity of
alumni.”

The senior gift drive is set up
as a pyramidal management struc-
ture, with 15 seniors on the steering
committee acting as coordinators.
Each steering committee member
coordinates the activities of his or
her subordinate captains, and each
captain in return manages five cam-

tual thought and expression at a lib-
eral arts university,” Selmeski said
in support of his position.

This form of writing, known
as “chalk-talk,” became a more
common method of communication
last semester among some organi-
zations, both recognized and clan-
destine at Bucknell. According to
Eisenstein, this chalking of the
sidewalk is a form of graffiti which
should be prohibited.

“The motion is designed to
protect the physical appearance of
he campus. We have one of the
nicest campuses in the Northeast
and the appearance of chalk is dis-
Tuptive,” Eisenstein said in expli-
cating his motion.

Eisenstein did say, though,
that his motion was not intended to

protect the political appearance of
the campus.” Much of the chalking
that has been done has been overtly
political and representative of posi-
tions which are directly in conflict
The most prominent has been the
chalking of a feminist organization

called Partnership of Women

vice president for administration.
Maxwell serves as head of the Sci-
ence Facilities Planning Commit-
tee, responsible for coordinating
the project.

Jack Harclerode, biology pro-
fessor and member of the commit-
tee, said he hopes the building will
be finished by next fall. “We would
like it to be done by the last day of
August next year. but with the
delays we’ve had, that may be
stretching it,” he said.

Delays several
forms, according to Maxwell.
“Material delays can often be a
problem and weather delays can be
a real problem and totally out of
our control,” Maxwell said.

According to Harold Rearick,
construction progress
“could be faster.” He sited the
removal of asbestos from Olin Sci-
ence to be the cause of a two week
building delay. “We had to shut
down for a few weeks while they
took out the asbestos,” he said.

But according to Maxwell,
this delay had been accounted for.
As part of phase II, which includes
the building of the biology build
Olin building
underwent renovations

As far as weather goes, Rear-
ick said that if the roof is not up
before the first snow, delays could
result. “I have my doubts as to
whether we'll be on the roof by
then,” he said.

The project, now at Phase II
in the three-phase plan, will eventu-
ally include the building of a psy-
chology facility. All stages are
being funded separately. Phase II
will cost approximately $12 million
dollars, much of which Maxwell
hopes will come from donations.

In addition, the university
will be “drawing on reserve funds
on the assumption that campaign
pledges will replace those reserve
funds that we’re using to fund the
project.”

“We took what’s called a $7
million bridge loan this past June
for a seven year period. That will
fund part of the $12 million pro-
ject,” he said.

The new facility will accom-
modate an expanding field and
advanced research, according to
Harclerode.

The basement of the biology
building “will contain things like
the animal facilities,” he said. On
that floor will be areas for holding
animals in temperature—regulated

When reached for comment
P.O.W.E.R. and another organiza-
tion that engages in chalk-talk,
Friends of Lesbians and Gay Men,
both expressed their opposition to
the BSG’s resolution on the
grounds that it limited dialogue
within a university environment
that should encourage
communication.

A representative from
P.O.W.E.R. stated that their organi-
zation’s “actions are on the whole
benign, yet it is apparent that the
BSG’s primary attack is against us,
since we are the ones who chalk the
walkways most frequently.”

According to Eisenstein, it
was not the political content of the
chalking that provoked his opposi-
tion, but the form of expression
itself. Eisenstein said he opposes

eral laboratories will be set aside
for freshman and sophomore biol-
Ogy majors.

President of the service fra-

Romeo expressed concern that a
ban on chalking the sidewalk
would limit of her organization’s
ability to advertise for events such
as the Red Cross blood drive.
Alpha Phi Omega, which was the
first organization on campus to use
chalk-talk, has found the chalking
of the sidewalk to be an effective
method to attract people to their
philanthropic activities.

Further, Eisenstein said, “I do
not think that first amendment
rights are being violated. We are
not telling anyone not to express
their opinions.” He cited that there
were many other forms and medi-
ums through which students can
communicate without chalking on
the University’s sidewalks.

Selmeski, however, argued
that “if this motion were to become
policy it is going to discriminate
against everyone, but mostly
against groups that have few other

been in existence a long time, pro-
vides a service to students, [and] is
not purely for personal gain.”

She said the present policy
was enacted “to be a mechanism
for making sure students are not
inundated” by student entrepren-
eurs. Dunlop said that another main
reason for the policy’s adoption
was “our sensitivity to criticism
from local merchants, [who] had

&Y

increasing concerns about competi-
tion from business activities on
campus. According to Dunlop, the
University receives ten percent of
the net receipts of the News Ser-
vice, which is allowed to use the
Bucknell name.

Skena responded to such
exceptions by saying, “I didn’t
make the sales and solicitation pol-
icy, and I can’t say I agree with
every aspect of it, but BSG found a
way to provide a service to the
Bucknell community while work-
ing within the present structure,
whether it is followed or not.”

Bill Farrell "92, an outspoken
critic of the current University pol-
icy, accuses the administration of
“censoring needs.” He claims
“Bucknell’s definition of service is
questionable,” since any successful
business must provide a_ service
needed by its customers, who value
the service enough to pay for it.
Farrell also pointed to the adver-
lisements for magazines, credit

cards and other products in the
classrooms of the academic build-
ings as another example of a double
standard in the University’s “philo-
sophical problem with students
making a profit.”

Last semester, Farrell submit-
ted a proposal to the Committee on
Complimentary Activities (CCA)
which would allow individual
entrepreneurship, while such activ-
ity would be approved and regu-
lated by a student/faculty commit-
tee, and both sales and advertising
would be limited; CCA examined
and rejected the proposal. Farrell
feels the policy should be broad-
ened to allow “a regulated student
entrepreneurial program in which
young entrepreneurs would be
given the chance to see their ideas
and talents put to work.”

Farrell fecls the BSG Dis-
count Card “is positive for the
Bucknell community, [since] it lays
the groundwork for what is to
come.” He is optimistic that stu-

dents may be able to take over the
production of the BSG card next
year.

Farrell’s optimism raises the
question: if an outside vendor is
allowed to conduct business on the
Bucknell campus and retain 95 per-
cent of the profits from the venture,
can a student operate in precisely
the same way? Dunlop said “the
policy might permit” such an
arrangement, but that such a ven-
ture had never been proposed by a
student.

Dunlop said that outside ven-
dors are currently allowed “in prac-
tice but not in policy.” He feels the
University should “develop criteria
for approval of outside vendors or
student entrepreneurs,” and that
student businesses should be
allowed “but we would have to do
it exactly the same as for outside
vendors.” Dunlop concluded that
“since we allow [outside vendors],
we need to put it down in writing,”
and that he will posssibly propose
that CCA consider the matter.

Coin prices on copiers double

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

In an effort to encourage the
use of copicr debit cards, the Ellen
Clarke Bertrand Library has raised
the cost of making copies with
coins. The cards, which are
described by library personnel as
more convenient, will allow stu-
dents to continue to make copies at
a cost of five cents each, while
those without debit cards will have
their copying costs doubled to ten
cents per page.

This change in price, which
only effects copiers in the library,
is an effort to promote the use of
the debit cards, as well as to discou-
rage people not associated with
Bucknell from using the library’s
copying facilities.

“The whole objective is to
make it easier for students to make
copies. We would also like to dis-
courage non-Bucknell people from
making use of the machines,” said
Joanne Young, associate director of
the library.

A random sampling of stu-
dents using the copier machines
found that most had a debit card
and considered it to be more con-
venient than using coins. Marnie
Bartholomew ‘94 said she used the
card “because it is cheaper and I do
not feel like carrying change
around.” As far as the extra cost of
using coins is concerned, she
stated, “It does not really bother
me. I see it as an incentive to use
the card.”

Amy Rogers ‘91, while con-
sidering the card to be a good idea,
found it “kind of annoying that you
have to pay an extra five cents to
use coins. They should not punish
you if you do not use the card.”

Responding to questions as to
whether the library was punishing
people for using coins, Young said,
“If you want to think of it as a pen-
alty, it is a penalty. We like to think
of it as an incentive.”

“We are trying to make all
the information the students and
faculty need available as quickly as
possible,” said Young. “The pur-
pose of the library is to encourage
freedom of information.”

Raising the cost of copies

made with coins is also intended to
discourage non-Bucknell people,
who are unlikely to have a debit
card, from using the library’s copi-
ers. According to Young, the
library has received numerous com-
plaints from students who have
been kept waiting to use a copier
by people from off-campus. The
library presently has seven public
copiers and one copier reserved for
faculty use.

According to Jim Muchlicr,
director of administrative services,
the copiers in the library are “an
extension of their information ser-
vices” and library-related uses
should have priority over others. In
this respect public use is a problem,
Muchler said, since many people
use the library’s facilities for their
personal copying needs.

Further, Muchler said that the
cost of copier paper has risen dra-
matically over the last four months,
increasing twenty-five percent to
$5.30 per a thousand sheets. In the
face of these increases the Univer-
sity is “practically the only public
copier in town charging a nickel.”
As a result, Muchler stated, many
people from town are using the
Library as a copying center.

Muchler said that the Univer-
sity does not view its copiers as a
source of profit and attempts to
operate them as close to cost as
possible. The library, according to
Young, operates on the same pol-
icy. The added cost for not using
the debit card is not expected to
bring in much extra revenue.

“In fact,” said Young, “if the
cards are used, as we hope they will
be, there will not be any extra
funds.” Young also stated that the
increase in cost for those using
coins, was not being used as a
means to create revenue to cover
other expenses within the library.

Despite the rising cost of
Paper at least one local copy center,
Lewisburg Office Equipment, is
still charging five cents per per-
sonal copy.

Angie Sheets, an employee at
the store, said that they also make
copies at three and four cents for
professors and non-profit organiza-
tions. "We already have quite a

number of students and professors
who have us make copies for
them,” Sheets said

While the transition to the
debit card is raising the cost of cop-
ying in the library, it may actually
keep the cost of copying down in
the future. Faced with the increas-
ing cost of paper, Muchler said,
“The reality is that we will have to
raise the cost of copies in the
future.” The benefit of the card is
that costs can be raised in incre-
ments, rather than jumping from
five to ten cents. Muchler said,
though, that he did not see the cost
of copying rising in the short term

According to Muchler, the
debit card appears to be the way of
the future for accessing services on
the Bucknell campus. It is his goal
to pul the present magnetic stripe of
the debit card on the student ID, as
well as expand the function of that
second magnetic stripe

“We are closer and closer all
the time to integrating the vendor
stripe onto the student ID,” Much
ler said. The vending company
appears to have an integrated card
that works, but it is yet to be tested
by Bucknell

The functions of the second
magnetic stripe could also be
expanded to include access to vend
ing machines and
According to Eric
Schmidt, the University’s purchas-
ing agent, these magnetic stripes
have the potential for a whole range
of vending services. Currently a
contract with Pepsi Cola Co. using
the debit system on a trial basis is
being considered, but the status of
the University’s examination of this
possibility is uncertain.

Schmidt did state that there
would be difficulties integrating all
of these vendor services onto a ID
card which will still need to per-
form the functions it does now: pro-
viding borrowing privileges at the
library, meal plan and declining
balance accounts, and the ability to
charge merchandise at the book
store. Considering these logistical
problems, according to Schmidt,
students cannot expect such a mul-
lipurpose card until some time in
the future.

machines.

gram and hopes
“they (all faiths)
can work
together to bring about unity.”
Building on this, both Father
Angelo and Mr. Hammerlee hope
to form some sort of student coun-
cil or very inclusive organization in
the chapel for people of all faiths.
As Mr. Hammerlee sums
up their sentiments, “This assign-
ment is a very gratifying one.”

By Michael Curtis

A new network to replace
Waterloo MacJanet has been
installed on campus. Waterloo

vices Staff member

nell, AppleShare i

on these computers

Shields stated that the new
network will have problems, and
will be slower, but more reliable
than the aging MacJanet. Apple-
Share makes it possible to per-
form software installation and
maintence much
an previously

efficiently

Students have already
noticed this slowness. Keith Over-
ton ‘93, BCS Student Assistant
stated that “It seems to take a lot
longer. People are starting to com-
plain.” The general student reac-
tion to the new network was
summed up with Julia Stout ‘93
wondcring, “Why did they have to
change it?” She said it was a has-
sle at first, but she has found it
easy to use.

Another change made by
BCS this year is introduction of a
policy allowing only one copy of
a document to be printed on a
printer. This is implemented in the
software, and many students have
found it to be annoying

Later in the semester as part
of the changes, all IBM computers
will be on a campus-wide net-
work, also. The new IBM lab in
the Chemistry Building will be the
first to have the new connections,
and, like the Macintoshes, the
IBMs will also require startup
disks in the future

Cartel using US
weapons

Government officials in
Columbia announced that dozens
of weapons given to the Nicara-
guan contras by the United States
are ending up in the hands of
Colombian drug cartels. Officials
fear that the flow of arms could
increase.

American authorities have
acknowledged in the past that
about 80 percent of the drug traf-
fickers’ weapons come from the
United States. Colombian govern-
ment officials are worried and
angered by the shipment of contra
weapons, which they blame indi-
rectly on the United States.

At the same time, intelli-
gence units in Colombia and the
United States are investigating
reports that a boatload of sophisti-
cated weapons, sent from Italy,
arrived in Venezucla and was
shipped to Colombia in early Sep
tember. The arms may signal a
new link between the drug cartels
and organized crime in Italy and
Spain to provide and distribute
cocaine in Europe.

USSR to vote on
private property

Soviet president Mikhail Gor-
bachev called for a nationwide refe-
rendum on whether to allow private
ownership of land, a_ proposal
which violates a fundamental prin-

ciple of communism.

In addressing the federal par-
liament, Gorbachev stated that the
decollectivization of land was too
important to leave to a small group
of politicians.

Allowing referendums is a
novel political concept within the
Soviet Union. Soviet officials pre-
dicted that it would take at least six
months to organize a viable refe-
rendum on land ownership.

Winnie Mandela
faces charges

Winnie Mandela, wife of
African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, was charged by
the South African government with
kidnapping and assault in connec-
tion with an abduction in 1988 of
four youths.

Mandela's bodyguards are
accused kidnapping the victims
and taking them to the Mandela
home, where Mandela and the
guards allegedly beat them. One of
the victims was taken away by a
bodyguard. Five days later the
boy's body was found in a field
with stab wounds to his throat.

The youths were suspected of
being police informants.

The decision to prosecute
Mandela could complicate negotia-
tions between the government and
the ANC concerning fundamental
changes in the nation's political
Structure.

EC toughens
stance on Iraq

The European Community
announced that the 12 member
nations are expelling all Iraqi mili-
tary ataches and limiting the move-
ment of Iraqi diplomats.

The Community said that
they would consider extending
enforcement of the United Nations
embargo against Iraq to include air
traffic. Officials stated that the
United Nations Security Council
must back an expanded boycott so
that it is effective on a global basis.

EC action was criticized by
American officials as muddled and
meck. But last week’s raids on the
French, Dutch, and Belgian diplo-
matic compounds have resulted in
more forceful actions.

lraqis bolster
forces in Kuwait

The Iraqi goverment has
sharply increased the numbers of
tanks and troops in Kuwait and
southern Iraq, the Defense Depart-
ment announced Tuesday.

The buildup appears to be
defensive in nature and would
make it more difficult to push Iraqi
forces from Kuwait militarily.

Iraq moved 95,000 more
troops into Kuwait and southern
Iraq within the past two weeks,
bringing the total to about 360,000.
Military analysts say that up to 40
percent of the troops belong to pre-
mier military units.

Pro-choicers
battle Souter

Two abortion rights leaders
told the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee Tuesday that Supreme Court
nominee David Souter should not
be confirmed to the court. In
response, several senators told
them that Souter was the least hos-
tile nominee that they could expect
from the Bush Administration.

Kate Michelman, executive
director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, and Faye
Wattleson, president of the Planned
Parenthood Action Fund, remained
uneasy. Michelman testified that
"we remain intensely concerned
that, if confirmed, he would destroy
17 years of precedent and cast the
deciding vote to overrule Roe v.
Wade," the 1973 ruling establishing
a constitutional right to an abortion.

Souter ended his testimony
before the senate committee Mon-
day, virtually assured of
confirmation.

Budget negotia-
tions stall

The budget negotiations at
Andrews Air Force Base stalled
early the week, allowing another
self-imposed deadline to pass. Con-
gress and the administration said
that an agreement was not in sight.

If no agreement is reached by
October 1, across-the-board spend-
ing Cuts are to take effect automati-
cally. The cuts could reach $105.7

billion.

The negotiators were dead-
locked over President George
Bush's proposal for a capital gains
tax cut. Democratic bargainers
insisted that any capital gains cut
would disproportionally benefit the
wealthy and must therefore be
linked to an increase in income
taxes on the rich. In addition, dif-
ferences increased over spending
cuts as Democrats scaled back the
cuts they were willing to accept.

Atlanta to host
‘96 Olympics

The International Olympic
Committee chose Atlanta to be the
site for the 1996 Summer Olym-
Pics, the one hundredth anniversary
of the modern Games.

Atlanta proposed a_ plan
whereby $1.2 billion in private
funds will be spent to hold the
games. The Games are expected to
add over $2.6 billion to the regional
economy.

The Olympic Committee was
attracted by Atlanta's
facilities, secure environment and
prospect of
revenues.

Keating indicted

fraud charges Tuesday and jailed
after he was unable to post a $5

communicated.”

If the resolution withstands
Selmeski’s motion to reconsider on
Sunday, it will move onto the
administration for consideration.
Eisenstein expressed confidence
that the resolution would be
accepted by the administration and
stated that he had been given assu-
rances from an administrator in the
spring that they were in favor of
ceasing chalk-talk.

When reached for comment,
President Gary Sojka said that he
was “stunned” by the BSG’s reso-
lution and did not feel able to reply
immediately. “This is a very seri-
ous issue and I am not ready to
comment,” Sojka stated, “this is
the sort of thing that bedevils
Superior Court Justices.”

John Dunlop, dean of student
life, stated that he believed that
chalk-talk “in and of itself is not
wrong and is not open to prohibi-
tion. This sort of expression is pro-

tected by the first amendment.” So
long as chalking stayed away from
forms of speech that would be con-
sidered name calling or tasteless
and it was not used on buildings,
Dunlop said, any writing which
elicits thinking is positive. “People
who want to limit speech are whis-
tling Dixie,” Dunlop said, “they are
just out to lunch.”

Eisenstein said that he was
motivated to present his motion by
what he considered to be a wide-
spread opinion on the campus that
chalk-talk is an objectionable form
of speech. Faced with the possibil-
ity that last Sunday’s resolution
will be reversed by a congress that
will contain ten new freshman rep-
resentatives, Eisenstein stated that
he was prepared to offer a motion
for a student referendum.

moment if the freshman representa-
tives will be able to vote on Sun-
day. David Skena “91, president of

defaces and detracts from this beautiful campus,

and Whereas: There are many less disruptive and cleaner meth-
ods to publicize messages and opinions,

Therefore Be it Resolved: that BSG recommend that chalk talk
be banned to all students and student organizations.

bers being present for such a
motion which deal explicitly with
old business. Today, Skena and
Dunlop were scheduled to meet to
clarify this issue.)

A student referendum on
chalking, Eisenstein believes, is
likely to be in favor of the aboli-
tion of chalk-talk. “Right now I am
going off my understanding of the
student body and I believe that
they are dissatisfied with this mode
of communication.”

If such a referendum were
held there is the possibility that
students may not respond to chalk-
talk itself, but the most common
example of it usage, the messages
written by the feminist organiza-
tion P.O.W.E.R. Since last spring
P.O.W.E.R. has been chalking the
University’s sidewalks with quotes
from men and women which high-
light concerns over the present
state of relations between the
sexes, Their activities have been
met with much dissatisfaction and

disapproval from many members
of the campus community.

If a referendum were used by
the BSG, Eisenstein stated that he
“would not be able to say exactly
what the students were reacting to,
but I wouid hope that they would
not be voting against the content of
the chalk-talk.”

Selmeski said that he thought
“unfortunately that the BSG is in
touch with the majority of students
and their opinions,” in that they
wanted to ban the chalking of
organizations such as P.O.W.E.R.
According to Selmeski, though,
majority rule must operate within
the limits established by civil rights
and constitutional law; he believes
both protect the activity of chalk-
talk.

If the motion to reconsider
fails Selmeski said that he would
consider resigning his post on the
BSG. “The BSG has done a lot of
things that I do not agree with, but
this is the only act that I have seen
that offends me,” Selmeski said.

According to Rislow, “The

Rislow concluded by saying,
“The generosity of alumni enables
a number of students to be able to
attend Bucknell. Your association
with Bucknell does not end when
you graduate.”

Daniels emphasized the
future and said, “A lot of things
have happened in the past that a

with, but that’s over. We want to
put all those things behind us and
plan for Bucknell’s future so other

A federal appeals-court judge
issued a temporary injunction last
week barring the University of Ari-
zonafrom continuing construction
on an observatory on Mount
Graham.

The Sierra Club obtained the
injunction against the university
claiming that the building would
disrupt the habitat of an endangered
species of red squirrel.

The Graham County Sheriff's
Department reported vandalism at
the site. Debris was placed in drain-
age culverts. In a rainstorm, the
road to the construction area would
have been flooded. Also, the lock
on the gate to the site was cut open.

Stanford preps
for quakes

Stanford University has bur-
ied a dozen containers containing
food and emergency supplies on its
campus that could be used in the
event of another earthquake.

The fiberglass containers,
measuring five feet tall and nine
feet wide, contain prepared meals,
enough to feed 10,000 people for
two days. The temperature within

the containers will be kept at 58
degrees, cool enough to preserve
the food for 20 years. The contain-
ers also hold tools, stretchers,
radios, and flashlights.

Barbara Tiernan, Stanford's
health and safety-systems coordi-
nator, said the containers are to
serve the University's 8,500 stu-
dents who may be left homeless
after an earthquake.

The  umiversity sustained
$140 million in damage from the
earthquake in San Francisco last
October.

Poli-sci professor researches
world problems in Bangladesh

By Rob Schroeder

What do you picture when
someone mentions Bangladesh? Do
you envision masses of people
draped in exotic clothes, sur-
rounded by run-down buildings?
Perhaps strange religious ceremo-
nies come to mind; the ones you’ve
seen on PBS or in National Geo-
graphic. Or maybe you think of
poverty, uncleanliness, and one of
the lowest standards of living in the
world. For a country so far away
from Bucknell and from our lives,
it’s natural that we think of these
images. Yet when someone men-
tions Bangladesh to Harry Blair, a
professor of political science, he
hears an important part of his life
being mentioned. I recently spoke
with Dr. Blair about his latest trip
there, and about his deep interest in
both Bangladesh and India.

Dr. Blair was in Bangladesh
for the thonth of August, 1990, as a
consultant to review a United
States aid program. This program,
called the Private Rural Initiatives
Project, was designed to help Ban-

gladeshi Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGO's). These
organizations are non-profit and
designed to promote community
uplift programs such as adult liter-
acy, building schools, and organiz-
ing youth groups. Also, since a
large part of Bangladesh livelihood
comes from farming, agriculture is
one of the main focuses of the
NGO. Dr. Blair explained that the
organizations emphasize “how-to”
farming techniques for crops like
tomatoes, bamboo and fruit trees.
Working with and building up the
community was the essential point
he stressed.

The object of this particular
project was to establish links
between Bangladesh’s numerous
NGO’s. Because of the large num-
ber of these organizations, Dr
Blair’s group was responsible for
helping to find the best methods of
inter-NGO communication. When
properly managed, these organiza-
tions can influence various social
lobbying groups and present a
strong case for some of Bangla-

desh’s most pressing problems to
ils government.

As team leader of the Private
Rural Initiatives Project, Dr. Blair
put his long association with Ban-
gladesh to work. He has visited the
country over ten times, speaks its
language, and has a long resume of
degrees, projects, publications and
field experience related to it. He
has done several rural development
projects in both Bangladesh and
India and continues to study public
policy both in south Asia and the
United States. In addition to his
scholarly research, he has worked
for the US Agency for International
Development, the World Bank, and
the Swedish International Develop-
ment Authority, among other
organizations. There is always the
emphasis on community develop-
ment, always the humanitarian con-
cern in Dr. Blair’s work.

While interviewing Dr. Blair,
I was impressed by his lengthy
study of not only an area, but of
problems that face the whole world.
He has used his field experience to

interpret universal concerns. Food
problems plague our globe. Poverty
is a never-ending problem for some
nations. Development and public
policy are constant concerns for all
governments. So are economic con-
flicts and social justice. By the end
of our talk I was convinced that
alleviating these problems were Dr.
Blair’s professional and personal
interests. I was assured of my
hunch when he told me why he
keeps going back to Bangladesh
and India. It’s the feeling that you
can have some impact on problems,
he said; that you can make a
difference.

The combination of these
feelings and his draw to south Asia
is what keeps taking Harry Blair
back. Back to those countries that
in reality look a lot like what we
picture them to be poor, underde-
veloped nations in need of a hand.
I’m sure that he will return to Ban-
gladesh as long as he feels he can
do something not only for that
country but for the advancement of
humanitarian causes world-wide.

Surviving life without the Bison

By Donna Walsh

Here we are, having gone
three weeks “cold turkey” without
the old Bison, and we’re still sur-
viving. The lack of this Bucknell
institution has certainly affected us
all (we may even be studying
more?!?), but for the Bison, regu-
lars, it has been a very difficult
time to endure.

Much of the anxiety felt is
self-inflicted, though. We were all
curious to see the new Bison and
Bison junkies especially looked for-
ward to spending long hours in the
renovated snack bar. Many 1990
graduates even felt somewhat
cheated that they would miss out on
the proposed improvements.

For many, this feeling of
anticipation made the return to
campus from the summer seem
like a “thrill of victory/agony of
defeat” commercial. With sweaty
palms, pounding hearts, and smil
ing faces Bucknellians approached
the U.C. After months of waiting,
we were finally going to see the
new Bison! But, alas, the Bison
was still boarded up! The sign read
“Snack Bar Located in the Cave”
The Cave? It had to be a cruel
joke. If the anticipation felt a few

minutes ago felt like the thrill of

victory, then this must be the
agony of defeat!

After climbing to the second
floor, a Bison junkie’s worst fears
were confirmed. There was a tiny

sign with the words “Snack Bar”
and an arrow pointing to the Cave,
and inside was the tiny, brown-
haired woman in the white uniform
seated at the cash register. What
have they done with our Bison?
Julia Polyak ‘91 spoke for us all
when she said, “I’m glad the Bison
is being renovated. Right now,
though, I miss it, even though it’s
still in operation. It’s just not the
same as what we’re used to.”

A closer inspection showed
that many of the ingredients that
made up the old Bison are still
present, but the old atmosphere is
definitely lacking. Sure, the refrig-
erator is stocked with cartons of
iced tea, there are tubs of Ben &
Jerry’s in the freezer, and the 3-
cent double-bubble gum is still for
sale. But cheese sticks are no
longer on the menu, and neither are
Bison breakfasts. In fact, the old
chalk-board menu is gone, too! The
lunch crowd found other places to
eat, and most importantly, no one
seems to just relax and spend time
there anymore.

These losses are especially
significant because the Bison was
more than just a snack bar, it was
herapy! Bucknellians could count
n the Bison as a permanent study
reak, or a meal prepared just the
way you liked it, or a place to
drown your sorrows in junk food!
"Its the cave," remarked Tom
Quinn '91. "It's just not the same."

There is some good news,
though. We are only a few, short
weeks away from the renovated
Bison that we were promised, and
the new Bison promises to be even

Ten tips:

By Marc Hames

Well, it’s three weeks into
school and according to Caf fre-
quenters, the food is getting just a
litde dull. To make matters worse,
the preparation personnel is
extremely understaffed with two
workers gone, and two more soon
to be leaving. However, it still
might be possible to beat the odds,
and get a livable meal with mini-
mum hassle. Caf worker and Buck-
nell student, Reenie Cummings
GR, offered me the following
advice for making mealtime more
pleasant:

1. “Don’t come during
rush hour (12:00, 5:00)." (At
these times the workers get kind of
stressed out and are apt to verbally
abuse a student innocently asking
for an extra chicken burger. Diners

better than it was before!

Mary Byerly, manager of the
Bison, vowed that the old favorites,
including cheese sticks and Bison
breakfasts, will still be featured on
the menu when the new Bison
opens. However, a variety of new
foods such as freshly baked pizza,
croissants, frozen yogurt, and ice
cream sodas will also be offered.
So, for all of you upperclassmen,
just close your eyes and remember
the way things used to be, and for
all of you freshmen, you’ve got a
great thing to look forward to!

2. “Read the menu board
located above the servers." (This
way it is possible to identify the
food before actually putting it in
your mouth.)

3. “If you don’t see some-
thing, ask." (There are all sorts of
goodies, especially ice cream, in
those freezers behind the counter.
So if all they have is “Nutty Bud-
dies” which you do not care for,
just politely explain this fact to any
of the workers who will be more
than happy to drop everything and
fish out a “Chief Crunchee” from
the bottom of the freezer for you.)

(Unless they’re moving.)

6. “Soup is always a safe

and hide your plate somewhere

what you can do with sugar, milk,
and a couple of tons of Bisquick.)

usually serve it on parent’s week-

The

First Amendment first

With the passage of a resolution by Bucknell Student Government (BSG) last Sunday

advocating the banning of “chalk talk,” the University community is once again grappling

with the distinction between graffitti, vandalism and free speech.

The concept of sidewalk chalking was first brought to the attention of our Community

when Alpha Phi Omega received University permission last year to chalk sidewalks in order

to promote their blood drive. The Partnership Of Women Engaged in Revolution
(P.0.W.E.R.) followed Alpha Phi Omega’s lead and began chalking the sidewalks to educate
us about the oppression of women in society. Recognizing P.O.W.E.R.’s cause as legitimate,
both Dean of Students John Dunlop and President Gary Sojka approved of P.O.W.E.R.’s

activities as long as non-permanent writing materials were used, and obscenities were left out

of their messages.

Those supporting the BSG resolution say that all chalking should be banned, claiming

that it is an eyesore to an otherwise aesthetically pleasing campus. What they overlook is

every American citizen’s fundamental right to freedom of speech.

The current system provides for University (i.e. administrative), oversight of groups

interested in using the campus’ sidewalks as a forum for responsible communication. While

we recognize that the sidewalks are University property, we would hope that the University

would hold to Constitutional principles and allow all groups to write on sidewalks. Equal

opportunity and access should be permitted

ple notification.

without prior review or consultation, but sim-

The BSG resolution passed last Sunday night was adopted without full representation of

the student body. The Freshman class had no opportunity to voice its opinion on this very

important matter. As the resolution comes up for reconsideration this Sunday night, we

encourage the BSG to analyze this issue closely and realize the dramatic impact that this

encroachment on first amendment rights would have on student’s lives at Bucknell.

The BSG will be setting a dangerous precedent by passing a resolution that restricts our

freedom of speech. Clearly campus aesthetics should not be held in higher regard than the

principles embodied in the Constitution of the United States.

Ferraro criticizes news story,
claims defamation of character

Dear Editor:

I have read the article in the
last Bucknellian concerning the
Bucknell wrestling coach, written
by Travis Elliott. I must seriously
question the intent of the author. I
would charge him with irresponsi-
ble joumalism that borders on defa-
mation of character at the very
least.

The responsibility of the
media is to report the news and not
to create the news. I would strongly
advise the Bucknellian staff to
report the facts and not try to dam-
age anyone's character by creating
a story. The story, as printed, is
slanted, sensationalized, inaccurate,
and very misleading.

I will attempt to tell the story
as it really happened.

Bob Ferraro was a 50 per
cent owner and an absentee partner
in Decathlon Athletics, Inc. which
is a private enterprise. Michele
Connors was the office manager of
Decathlon Athletics and not a part-
ner in the business. Jan Clemons
was the clerk in the business who
wrote a check to BTR, Inc. for the
rent payment. There was enough
money in the account at the time to
cover the check.

Michele Connors then wrote
other checks to pay various
invoices. However, she was not
aware that Jan had written a check
to BTR, Inc. The other checks were
cashed before the BTR check.
Therefore, the BTR check came
back insufficient funds.

A false police report was
filed by Detective Dugan of the
Milton Police Department. He
claimed that Bob Ferraro person-
ally wrote the check to BTR, Inc.
knowing there was no money in the
account to cover the check. Detec-
tive Dugan interviewed Jan Clem-
ons and was well aware that she

wrote the check and at the time
there was money in the account to
cover the check
The charges were immedi-
ately dismissed by the Milton mag-
istrate. I am in the process of filing
a law suit against
Detective Dugan and
the Milton Police
Department for an
obvious defamation of
character
Decathl
on Athletics
went out of
business in
May of
1990.
If the
Bucknellian
is interested in
the personal life of Bob
Ferraro they should
know that he has been
happily married to the
same woman for 20
years and has three
wonderful children. His
son, Bobby, was a two
time high school wres-
uing champion as
well as a national
high school wres-
tling champion. He
was the all-time
leading scorer for Lewisburg High
School in soccer shattering the old
record by 31 goals. He also gradu-
ated high school with a 3.9 GPA
and is presently a freshman at
Bucknell.
1 am entering my 18th year as
Head Wrestling Coach at Bucknell.

I have produced 31 Conference
champions as well as an NCAA
Division I All-American. We have
had 34 wrestlers represent Bucknell
at the NCAA Championships in the
last 15 years. Bucknell is presently
ranked in the top 25 of
all Division I teams in
the country.
Iam also the

our recrea-
tion depart-
ment from 17

leges and universities.

ents that are being used

ute goods around

been nominated
to be the Execu-
tive Director of the National Wres-
ting Coaches Association which
represents over 50,000 wrestling
coaches in the country.
The above are facts about
Bob Ferraro.
The incident that you printed
about Decathlon Athletics hap-

pened in April of 1990. I am disap-
pointed that Travis Elliott feels a
need to dig up dirt that is five
months old and then puts it on the
front page of the school newspaper.

If you are interested in the
private lives of the coaches, then
for all those coaches that do not
have private enterprises, let’s find
Out who was delinquent in paying
their telephone bills in 1985.

It is unfortunate that our
newspaper is not more current and
more responsible. I hope that in the
future the Bucknellian checks thor-
oughly into the facts and uses better
judgment before writing a damag-
ing story.

Sincerely,
Bob Ferraro, Wrestling Coach

Senior praises
Caudill letter

To the editor:

It is reassuring to see that someone clsc notices these things
(Mr. Gordon Caudill 9/14). However, in my praise of Mr. Caudill’s
letter I will be succinct, and propose a course of action.

If you could agree with the sentiment, and maybe even the spe-
cifics of Mr. Caudill’s letter, don’t give to Bucknell. If you must give
(over and above the heinous amounts you’ ve been forced to give in
the ‘Rip-Off-O’Rama’ Bookstore) give to a club or a sports team or

even your fraternity or sorority.

Mr. Caudill’s closing was correct. Students don’t count. But

alumni do. (But only

a potential source of income.) Make it clear

now that your intentions to give are contingent upon changes you
want to be made. I know its cliché but do: “Make a difference,” at

least try to.

Student responds to racism letter

Dear Editor,

IT am writing in response to
Juarrannetta McNabb’s letter con-
cerning sexism and racism on
campus.

Juarrannetta’s letter really hit
home. As a fresh-
man, I too was
annoyed at the
amount of
unfriendliness and
snobbery on cam-
pus. However, I
never considered it
to be related to my
race or sex (I am a female minor-
ity). I just thought the campus was
full of ignorant snobs. But perhaps
what I observed was racism. To put
it simply, I am not a WASP.

When I first arrived at Buck-
nell, I was looking forward to meet-
ing new people — an meet them I
did. However, in most cases, the

next time I saw him or her, I was
blatantly ignored (despite my
hello). This was not an isolated
case. It happened almost all the
time. It became so common that I
was surprised any time my hello

What kind of person can ignore you
after you have talked with him or her
during a meal or in another

student’s room?

was returned. Is this normal? I
think not. What kind of person can
ignore you after you have talked
with him or her during a meal or in
another student’s room?

Needless to say, I have
become accustomed to being
ignored on campus. Now when I
am introduced to new people, I

don’t expect them to acknowledge
my presence the next time I see
them. I find myself ignoring them
as well. In other words, I have
learned to be unfriendly here at
Bucknell. So, I apologize to Juar-
rannetta because I
may have been one
of those people
who failed to say
hello to her. I truly
am sorry. But,
please understand
that there are other
people who once
felt the way you do now and that
there are friendly people here —
but like me, they have been condi-
tioned to be cold and snobby. What
a wonderful thing to learn at
Bucknell.

Freshman Forum | Need for chalk-talking on
campus questioned

By Richard Polt

I don’t know about other freshmen, co-ed halls on campus, but
mine is irking me in a big way. It’s not that I don’t get along with
my hallmates, in fact it’s quite the opposite. A lifetime of stories and
private jokes have been generated in the three weeks we've lived
together. The problem is the “No Hook-Up” policy instituted by the
women as a means of maintaining hall friendships forever and ever.
In plain language, the chance of a non-platonic relationship is out of
the question. This policy lacks foresight and can prove to be a con-
straint on the feelings two people may have for one another.

In fairness to the women of the hall, I should briefly state their
side of the story. They believe that a “hook-up” with a male member
of the hall will lead to an uncomfortable situation because A) They
will be living together for the rest of the year and can not be con-
fused about their feelings toward each other and B) other people will
find out and jump to false conclusions

At this point most of you are probably saying to yourselves,
“is this guy serious?” Well, I’m actually not, but the joke itself is
one which has been made by many freshmen males during the last
couple of weeks. The joke is harmless, but it is indicative of a situa-
tion which does exist and I’m not thrilled about it.

Freshmen guys are in a state of limbo. Girls our age are scout-
ing for upperclassmen while girls younger than us do not exist in
Lewisburg (at least I haven’t seen any). It really doesn’t bother me
too much because I know that one day I’ll be a senior and I'll con-
vince some freshmen girl that I’m really a respectable person. I do
find it amusing, however, that this ornate system of deferential rela-
tionships has become so much a part of the college experience. One
footnote: it has come to my attention that apparently, upperclass
girls are looking to meet the freshmen gentlemen. I have seen litle
evidence of this but I’ll keep an eye out for such a phenomena.

At any rate, I’ll have plenty of time to “male-bond” with all
my friends who are in the same predicament as I am. I also can be
grateful for the fact that I’m not living in a hall with a bunch of
cheap girlfriends, but one with girls who I can trust and talk to about
anything

The Bucknell Student Gov-
emment has passed a motion which
suggests that the University admin-
istration ban chalk-writing on the
campus sidewalks. The wording of
the resolution, which passed by the
narrow margin of a 14-10 vote,
States that due to the
availability of other
means of communi-
cation, especially
ones which do not
affect the aesthetic
environment of the
campus, the Univer-
sity administration
should ban chalk-
writing. Why would
our BSG _ propose
what appears to be
such a blatant offense
against the Constitu-
tion and against our
freedom of speech?

To answer this I
would suggest we
take a closer look at
what is really at issue here.

As the motion now reads,

there are two strong arguments

Senior comments on change
in chapel’s Mass attendance

By Christine Zapotocky

and parties to attend to do some-

When you notice something
unusual happening on campus,
something wonderful, even, you
want to tell people. I have recently
observed something on Sunday
afternoons which I feel should be
recognized.

I’ve been attending the 4:00

around to make us do anymore.
Secondly, the church is unfa-

Mass at Rooke
Chapel, as I have
for the past four
years, but this
fall there is a dif-
ference. Since
my freshman
year, the atten-
dance at Mass
has been declin-
ing at an
astounding rate.
The few of us
that continued to
attend the  ser-
vices arrived
from the library,
toting our books,
and sat scattered
in that huge
chapel. We were
like little islands,
avoiding each
others’ space and
eyes, finally
sprinting to the
caf when Mass
was over.

Attendance
often picked up
around finals’
time, of course,
and during the
basketball season
our starting team became the most
devout Catholics on campus, but an
overall lack of enthusiasm per-
vaded our religious lives.

Religious devotion itself is
quite taboo here at B.U. The relig-
ious organizations on campus have
to use food and videos to lure mem-
bers, and I’m
sure I lost the
attention of at
least fifty per-
cent of the read-
ers of this letter
when they hit
the word
“Catholic”.

When we
come to college,

Mass itself is different, too.

antine—not Roman—Catholic, the

But something is changing in
the attitude of Catholics on campus.
At Mass this week, I was astounded
that the chapel was so packed. And

become our friends by the end of
the sixty-minute service. The choir
sings a greater portion of the Mass,
and the entire congregation sings
with them, which is a modern-day
miracle in itself. More students
directly participate in Mass than
ever before, as ministers, readers,
and ushers. And the bread that is
used for Communion is baked by
students on a
Friday night, no
less, while their
friends are get-
ting ready for a
wild night at the
fraternities.

I think
most of _ the
credit for this
“rebirth” = must
go to. Father
Angelo, a new
face on campus.
His enthusiasm
has been contag-
ious, and he’s

his ideas for
creating a “com-
munity” of Cath-
olics.  Person-
ally, I'd also like
to believe that
this enthusiasm
has always been
within all of us,
too, but because
of the indiffer-
ence —_ towards
religious devo-
tion on this cam-
pus, it’s been

hibernating and only needed a bit
of coaxing to be reawakened.

Why am I writing this?
Maybe because I think there should
be more of an acceptance of relig-
ious devotion on campus. And even
more than that, I’m hoping to
inspire a few Catholic students who
might have tried
the Bucknell
religious _—pro-
grams at one
time and decided
to give it up out

cliques, but bump elbows with

have too many classes, meetings, complete strangers, who somehow myself...

within it worth supporting. First of
all, the BSG is not suggesting that
there should be a ban on all expres-
sions of opinion on campus. It has
simply requested a ban on one par-
ticular activity which detracts from
the aesthetic appeal of our campus.
There are an incredible num-
ber of other outlets for the groups

on this campus to express their
views. Those who claim that this
ban is a clear violation of individ-
ual freedom of speech are just
denying the fact that the groups
who use chalk-talk still have access
to many other forms of communi-
cation. I feel especially strongly on
this point, as it is my sole job as
opinions editor to print the views of
the Bucknell community. Along
with the opinions page of The
Bucknellian, groups may speak
through other publications on cam-
pus such as the Catalyst, Sentinel,
or Bucknell Forum, through signs
in the U.C., signs in dorms, on the
campus radio station, through fly-
ers, mailings/notices of meetings,

and any other creative means they
can come up with to get their point
across and to rally support. There
is certainly a medium here for
every point of view.

Another significant part of
this argument is the magnitude of
this change. How many groups
would a ban on chalk-talking

affect? Some will argue that it is
irrelevant whether it affects two
groups or twenty, but I believe that
it is relevant. Obviously, there are
many other means to communicate
on campus and groups are taking
advantage of them, as the current
number of
minimal.
The second aspect of this
motion which I feel deserves atten-
tion is the issue of whether the
mess caused by chalk-talking is
aesthetically pleasing. Bucknell
has a beautiful and well-cared for
campus. The administration spends
a great deal of money keeping the
grounds and buildings in excellent
condition. When individuals write

chalk-writers is

their temporary grafitti all over the
sidewalks, it detracts from the
environment.

These writings often remain
for several days, long after the
blood drive has already occurred.
and the feminist quotes have been
read and re-read and responded to
obscencly and angrily. The rain

comes, as it
always does, and
rather than wash-
ing away the
chalk, it usually
smears and
blurs. We are
then left with
illegible — mark-
ings and a
brightly-colored
mess.

Another
aspect of this
argument
involves the
responses to the
writings. Last
semester, Buck-
nell had some

serious problems with responses to
chalk writings. Many of them were
obscene, hurtful messages, which
the University had to come along
and clean up. I understand that it is
not the groups who currently have
permission from the University to
chalk-talk that are writing these
vile things, but the obscenity is in
response to their writings. If we
eliminate the provocation of
obscenity on the campus sidewalks,
we climinate the obscenity on the
sidewalk. There is just no need for
the community to have to see this
mess every day on the academic
quad when there are many other
means available on campus in
which to express one’s opinion.

Student addresses Caudill’s
Criticism through open letter

By Mark Leister

I was shocked by last weck’s letter, from Mr.
Gordon R. Caudill to President Gary Sojka, con-
cerning the vast number of injuries that have appar-
ently been inflicted upon the poor carcass of Mr.
Caudill by Bucknell University. He has obviously
been struck to the quick and can think of no better

recourse than
to pen a fer-
vent attack at
the University
community.

I would
like to address
this piece to
Mr. Caudill;
however, he
has made it
all too clear

that he wishes there to be “no more communications
from Bucknell University.” Thus, I am forced to
write an open letter to him with the scant possibility

of it one day catching his eye.

Mr. Caudill,

“Robocop II” falls short

By Lee Guzofski

Hello Bucknellians and welcome to the fabulous world of
cinema where magic and reality come together and create a visual
smorgasbord of... oh, the hell with it.

Not that I’m against a wordy and circuitous intro like this
but, the movie I wish to discuss is Robocop 2 and, to be honest, it
isn’t worthy of that much effort. However, for the glory of Bucknell
and the teeming hordes of movie reviewer groupies everywhere, I
shall press ever onward...

Robocop 2 is a predictable romp in which our “hero” is
back; but this time in a world plagued by a vicious narcotic called
“Nuke.” He tries to stem the traffic of this drug by hunting down the
evil Caine, psychotic cult leader and all-around meanie. At any rate
(and to make a miserable story short), Robocop’s circuits get repro-
grammed, turning him into an overly courteous Roboweenie. Then
Caine’s mind is placed into a super metallic monster. Of course, the
movie “climaxes” with Roboputz fighting a destructive battle with
the Caine-bot.

Okay, look, I enjoyed the first Robocop offering. I’ll even
admit that against my better judgement. This film, however, was
complete and total maggot-ridden garbage. It was a slime trail
tracked across the face of modern cinema by the slug of gratuitous
violence and gore. This movie was a non-stop documentary on the
merits of turning blood into movie dollars. Really, it is an upsetting
statement on modem society and I for one, I for one... 1 for one am
getting carried away. If you are a fanatic for gladiator films and/or
biology documentaries such as “The Miracle of Blood” or “Your
Insides Out,” then this is the film for you. However, if you’re some-
one who might enjoy something with, oh say... ANY SORT OF
WORTH, then you can (and should) ignore this film. In summation,
this film was doggie doodle. Thank you; have a nice yesterday and a
pleasant next Thursday.

Editor’s note: Lee Guzofski will review a newly released movie each
week in the Arts and Entertainment section of The Bucknellian.

“Nobody’s Child” unifies artists

Musicians come together to aid the Romanian Angel Appeal

By Jon Elliot

The late 1980s saw the crea-
tion of a phenomenon which linked
well known musicians with a needy
charity, of which Live-Aid, Farm-
Aid and Amnesty International
were a few of the more popular
concerts which drew the world’s
attention.

The 1990s, but a few months
old, has witnessed the release of
three, quite impressive albums
which have followed the examples
set by Live-Aid and its spinoffs.
Along with Roger Water’s The
Wall: Live In Berlin and the gala
production of Knebworth ‘90, both
of which were produced to benefit
charitable causes, Olivia Harrison,
Barbara Bach, Yoko Ono and Linda
McCartney have collaborated to
compile an all-star album dedicated
to the long-term aid of the thou-
sands of Romanian orphans who
suffer from deprivation.

Nobody’s Child: Romanian
Angel Appeal (Warner Bros.), like
most compilations of it’s kind, is
bound to have it’s ups and downs,
yet from the Bee Gees to Guns N’
Roses little fault can be found with
the choice of artists and song
selection.

Oddly enough, this string of
fifteen songs has never been
released prior to the production of
this album. There is a creatively
diverse collection of artists who
have contributed their talents to this
effort.

The music ranges from the
Traveling Wilburys title track,
which is their first piece of released
material since the untimely death of

Art Review

Exhibit appeals to
philosophical artists

By Cynthia Levinson
Staff Writer

“Primal Denouments: The
Dante Painters” opened in the Cen-
ter Gallery last Friday. The opening
was preceeded by a dinner and a
panel discussion, both of which
were in conjuction the 15th Annual
Conference of Merleau-Ponty
Circle.

Merleau-Ponty was a French
philosopher who maintained the
belief that painting is an outlet
which enables the artist to vision
and existence through the medium
of paint. The Dante painters are a
group of five New York artists who
meet weekly at the Cafe Dante.

The works are quite varied,
and seem to be unified only by
their common belief in the Mer-
leau-Ponty philosophy.

The panel discussion which
preceeded the gallery opening was
attended by Bucknell staff and
faculty members as well as mem-
bers of the conference. The panel
was comprised of the artists and a
number of philosophers. Although
the discussion was interesting, it
was a bit too lengthy, and the phi-
losophers lost the bulk of their
audience early on in the discussion.
Thus, much of the audience missed
the opportunity to hear the artists
speak about their works.

The exhibit itself shows that
the artists are commited to express-
ing themselves through their art
and doing so in an abstract fashion.
Their art may appeal to some view-
ers more than others, but it should
convey to everyone that it is art
with philosophy and intent behind
it.

compilations of such depth and

with the exception of possibly one

Cornelia — 1803

By Jim Seibert

Every afternoon the sun blew through that window
and it built a buttress of dust

braced against the oak floor.

And Cornelia sat

with those diamonds,

making them dance in her palms,

their prisms shattering light across her face.

She held them to her tongue and her lips,
and then to the window pane,

holding them between the sun and her eyes.
They scratched lines in the glass
like white eyelashes.

And when she began to carve the “C”
she must have seen

the front driveway,

its crumbled oyster shells

unravelling like a bolt of white cloth
across the Virginia green.

Tobacco, rows of broad (gaves, green as money
being piled onto carts.

Slaves, an army of ants
carrying loads back to a nest,
their backs sweating,

their bodies dampening

and fertilizing the earth.

In the distance she must have seen the huts
and their smoke, rising like free-floating cotton.

Cornelia kept scratching her name and the date,
putting the last curve in the “3”

seeing the soundless leather

brush the backs of negro men.

Field hockey registers
first win at Georgetown

By Scooter Van Kirk and
Julie McCausland
Staff Writers

The Bucknell women’s ficld
hockey team defeated the George
town Hoyas 3-2 last Sunday in
overtime, capturing its first win of
the season

After a disappointing 0-4
start, the squad was ripe for a vic
tory as they clashed with the highly
touted Hoyas.

“The game started out slug-
gishly,” attested Bison Coach Jen
Averill. “We made several foolish
mistakes in the first half.”

Because of this lapse the
Hoyas jumped to a quick 1-0 lead
on a goal by Georgetown forward
Liza Fox. Less than one minute
later, Steph Carfley ‘93 put in what
coach Averill described as “an
amazing goal.”

The ball was crossed in front
of the goal by Sue Wells “93 and
deflected into the upper comer by
Carfley, who used a_ difficult
reverse stick move to tie the game
at 1-1

The score remained
unchanged until the end of the first
half when the Bison conceded a
goal to end the half with the score
2-1 in favor of the Hoyas. The

Bison came out much stronger in
the second half, and played without
the errors that had plagued them
throughout the first half

It was not until late in the
second half that the Bison were
able to pull even on a goal by co-
captain Jeanette Aurand ‘92, off an
assist from Al Baldwin ‘94

Another Hoya drive on goal
was rejected by the tenacious Bison
defense to end regulation in a 2-2
tic, sending the game into overtime.

Georgetown had an opportu-
nity to score early in the extra ten
minute period, but failed to capital-
ize. With three minutes left in over-
timethe Bison were awarded a cor-
ner at the Georgetown goal.

The teamwork of veteran cor-
ner specialists Meghan Clark ‘92
and Katrina Mueller ‘93 resulted in
the winning score by Amber Baxter
‘92, who sent her becline drive
careening by a helpless Hoya
goalie for Lady Bison victory

Army fights off

women’

By Christopher Mosunic

The women’s tennis squad
dropped its record to 1-1 last Satur-
day in a close match against the
Lady Cadets of Army, 5-4.

Women’s tennis is a new var-
sity sport at Army, and the Lady
Bison did not know what to expect.

As it turned out, the Lady
Cadets were a force to be reckoned
with. The most grueling match of
the afternoon involved Kymm Carl-
son ‘94 and Army’s top player.

Though Carlson lost the first
set 6-0, she battled back in the
second.

They were neck and neck for
the entire set before won the tie-
breaker 18-16, giving her the
match.

During the match Carlson
protested three line calls made by
the Army player, as she felt on the
short end of the stick in the
disputes.

Carlson commented, “I was
really nervous the first set and let
her get away, but by the second my
game was at its height and if it
hadn’t been for those calls on my

s tennis

set points, I think I could have run

, away with it.”

Bucknell’s strong singles play
was highlighted by Mary Ann
Benack ‘92 and Karen Stagliano
“92. Both players defeated their
Army counterparts in straight sets.

“T just got up on her and
didn’t let down,” said Stagliano.

These two powerhouses then
com.ined their skills and put away
their opponents in a doubles match,
winning 6-1, 6-3.

Coach Rose
impressed with
performance.

She assessed, “4-5 is very
respectable against Army. They
were just a little better off of the
mark. If it weren’t for the nerves,
we might have won.”

The Lady Bison will face two
Patriot League rivals this weekend,
as they travel to Lafayette tomor-
row and Lehigh on Sunday.

Coach Ewan commented,
“Lehigh is just a notch above
Lafayette but  they’re both
extremely tough. If we’re a little
more aggressive and trust our game,
we can win both of these matches.”

Ewan was
Bucknell’s

the first half to take a one-goal lead
at halftime.

“American surprised us with
their speed,” stated Averill. “There
was confusion and we had trouble
containing their offensive drives.”

The second half was a one-
sided match, with American main-
taining and lengthening their lead.

The first half momentum
carried the home team into the sec
ond period, where they immedi-
ately scored on a penalty shot.

Bucknell’s second and last
goal of the day came on an unas-
sisted effort by Wells.

In the waning minutes of the
half American scored an insurance
goal to clinch the win, 4-2.

As Averill reflected on the
weckend, she explained that the dif-
ference in play between Saturday
and Sunday was the team’s ability
to anticipate the plays at
Georgetown.

Bucknell will travel to Holy
Cross and face their first Patriot
League opponent, who according to
Averill, looks strong and has shown
great promise so far this season.

This will be the first ever
match-up between the Bison and
Crusaders, and following a week of
hard practice, Bucknell hopes to be
well prepared for an intense match.

A look back at 16 years of excellence

By Mark Abrahamsen
Staff Writer

Dynasty is a word that is
often overused today in the world
of sport, as long and legitimate runs
of supremacy are few and far
between. But one of the most
impressive true dynasties in NCAA
history concluded Saturday at
Bucknell. Last weekend the Bison
men’s cross-country team had its
record of 167 consecutive dual-
meet victories snapped, when it lost
to a powerful UConn.

Though many casual sports
fans only care about the Univer-
sity’s revenue-producing teams,
football and basketball, the cross-
country team’s domination over
opponents since 1974 has gone
largely unnoticed by the typical
Bucknell onlooker.

During the historic run, the
Bison have rolled to 15 consecutive
East Coast Conference champion-
ships, and have placed in the top
three of the prestigious IC4A post-
season championship meet six
times.

Coach Art Gulden, who has
held the Bison reins throughout the
streak, played down the signifi-
cance of the record despite its
impressive figures.

“The streak wasn’t very
important,” assessed Gulden,

a

“What really matters is how we’ll
be running at the end of October (in
the Patriot League Championships).
Hopefully we'll react well to the
defeat, and perhaps the loss will
prepare us more for future meets
better than the casy wins.”

The question of whether the
Bison can recover will be put to
test in just two weeks, as they
travel south for the West Virginia
Classic.

There Bucknell will run
against powerful Pittsburgh, the
same school who nearly ended the
streak in 1988. In that meet hosted
by the Panthers, the Bison
squeaked by with a close 26-29
victory.

One has to look way back to
Oct. 5, 1974, when Bucknell last
lost a dual-meet. On that date in
Philadelphia, a tough Lehigh team
pulled out a close victory.

The Bison that year were co-
captained by Frank Carroll ‘74 and
Bruce Hyde ‘74, who led the team
to eight consecutive wins after the
Lehigh defeat, including second-
place finishes at the E.C.C. and
IC4A championships.

The following year Bucknell
got sweet revenge against Lehigh,
defeating the Engineers 27-30. The
Bison cruised through E.C.C.’s,
and captured their first IC4A title
Bucknell duplicated the double

championship in 1980.

The Bison almost saw their
streak severed in 1985, when they
faced a very tough Iona team in
New York City.

As the meet went down to the
final runner on each squad, Buck-
nell held on for a grinding 28-29
triumph. But for most of the 167
wins, the Bison just ran away from
all of its competitors, and though
the record streak is over, Bucknell
will continue to put out an incredi-
ble group of runners at every meet.

It’s not often when Gulden
has had to explain a defeat, but the
creator of this dynasty offers the
following perspective: “You’re
never prepared to handle something
of this nature. But we'll see if we
can turn it into something positive.
If we can implement what we’ ve
leamed from it, we should come
out a better team.”

Perhaps a burden has now
been lifted from the runners, and
even though the university may
never witness a streak of that size
ever again, Bucknell cross-country
is still sitting comfortably on top of
the Patriot League.

As for the next 16 years, only
time will tell if the Bison can main
tain their standard of excellence
that has kept them at the pinnacle
of their sport for the past two
decades.

Staff Writer

Bucknell hosted its ninth
annual invitational volleyball tour-
nament last weekend, looking to
post some big wins in a strong ficld
of competition. Loyola (Md.), took
top honors, with Bucknell finishing
in fourth position. Rounding out
the field, Rider and Cleveland State
second and third, while St. Francis
finished last.

"We were really psyched for
Loyola and Cleveland State since
they both beat us at the Loyola tour-
nament," said co-captain Kara Foro-
sisky '92. "We knew if we played
well we could beat them.”

Before Bucknell could get
their hands on Loyola and Cleve-
land State, they had to deal with
Rider College. Bucknell came into
the match all fired up, but so did the
Lady Broncs. The first two games
fell in favor of Rider 16-14, 15-10.
However, this didn't break the spirit
of the Lady Bison as they held on to

crushed stopped Bucknell’s come-
back hopes, though, by taking the
fourth game 15-9. Bucknell had 45
kills in the match, led by their two
captains, Forosisky with 13 and
Kristen Colbert '91 with 10.

"It was a really good match
for us," said first year coach Cindy
Opalski. "We just fell into slumps
at times where we weren't passing
the ball that well and that's all they
needed to stay on top."

The next opponent, Loyola,
had little difficulty with Bucknell,
as the Lady Bison dropped three
straight games to Loyola 15-10, 15-
10, 15-6. Loyola, led by its two all
tournament selections, senior setter/
hitter Gina Iarocci and sophomore
hitter Mary Percoco, took advan-
tage of Bucknell's nincteen recep-
tion errors and seven ball handling
errors to seal the victory for
Loyola.

After getting the early part of
Saturday morning off, Bucknell
had time to reflect back upon previ-

ous matches. Coach Opalski
thought it was time for a change in
the offensive scheme. The Lady
Bison switched their standard 5-1
offense, 5 hitters and 1 setter, to a
6-2 offense, 6 hitters and 2 setters.

"What it does is give our
team a more optioned attack," said
Coach Opalski. "Instead of going
to Dee (Scinta '92) all the time we
can now go to Mary(Jordan '93) as
well. It takes some of the pressure
off Dee and allows us to utilize her
defensive skills a bit more."

"I love it," stated Jordan.
"It’s a lot more responsibility, but it
gives us more options."

The offensive change seemed
to work well. Bucknell rolled to a
3-1 victory over St. Francis and
seven different players recorded at
least three kills in the match. Lead-
ing the way was junior hitter Kath-
leen Sullivan who had seven kills,
four aces, and four digs.

Young golf team looking to gain
experience; finishes 15th at F&M

By Jamie Diaferia

The varsity golf team opened
the 1990 season with a fifteenth
place finish in a field of twenty-
four participants at the Franklin &
Marshall Sheraton tournament over
the weekend. The tournament, held
in Lancaster, was “encouraging”
according to Coach Tommy
Thompson, because it demonstrated
that despite having a young team,
the Bison golfers could still be
competitive in a difficult league.

While he does concede that
there is room for improvement
through experience, he sees no rea-
son why the team cannot perform
well in the upcoming Georgetown

Tournament in
Virginia.

The Bucknell team began the
tournament on Sunday by shooting
a combined 324, which was enough
to place them thirteenth behind
Delaware, Georgetown, and Seton
Hall, among others. Captain Mike
Smigie ’92, and Don Hansen ‘94
both led the team in the opening
round with a score of 77, while
another freshman, Doug Dollen-
berg, shot an impressive 80 to help
the Bison cause. Dave Fries ‘93
and Scott Miller ‘93 struggled a bit
in the early rounds, however, shoot-
ing 90 and 92 respectively. The
next day, conditions on the course
became a factor, as high winds

Fredericksburg,

often led to unpredictable shots.
Fortunately, the team was able to
adjust to the change, as Fries, Han-
sen and Dollenberg all shot 83.
Meanwhile, Miller and Smigie shot
82 and 88 respectively.

Coach Thompson = was
pleased with the performance of the
team because he feels that despite
the fact that he has a young team,
they handled themselves well and
played like a team with experience.
“I’m encouraged,” he said. “We
still have to develop some consis-
tency in all five travelling players,
but I feel that, on the whole, there
is a lot to be pleased about.” He
also feels that despite the loss of
senior John Ingham, two time all

East Coast Conference player, this
year’s team is stronger. “We defi-
nitely have more depth this year,”
said Thompson. “I have more con-
fidence in our one through five
players.”

This Friday and Saturday the
Bison will participate in the
Georgetown Invite. Coach Thomp-
son is excited at the prospects for
his team, although he has no partic-
ular goals that he would like to
achieve. “I am really just looking
for steady improvement in all five
players. We are thinking more in
terms of the spring season, and not
so much how we do this fall. We
are a hard working team, and we
should do all right.”

Women’s soccer still winless after
2-1 loss to Nittany Lions yesterday

By Anne Taback

In women’s soccer action
yesterday afternoon, Penn State
defeated Bucknell 2-1, keeping the
Lady Bison winless this season at
0-4. All of the scoring came in the
first hal’, as Bucknell’s Amy
Krause ‘91 tallied the opening goal
just 3:36 into the game, giving the
Lady Bison an early one goal
advantage. Krause’s score came on
the assist of midfielder Christina
Baselga ‘91.

The Nittany Lions were
undaunted, however, as Charity
Grims scored the equalizer at
16:32. Just 12 minutes later Penn
State’s Jeanine Baldino
what turned out to be the game
winner on a ball that sailed past the
outstretched arms of goaltender
Kim Fekel ‘93.

The Lady Bison hope to turn
things around as they travel to Phil-
adelphia for tomorrow’s game
against the UPenn Quakers.

Last Saturday Bucknell fell to
the Delaware Blue Hens by a score
of 3-1.

scored

Bucknell fell behind early in
the game when the Blue Hens were
able to score at 13:00. They capital-
ized again on a corner kick with
just one minute remaining in the
half to take a 2-0 advantage into the
locker room. Co-captain Dana Esse
“91 believed that the second goal
“was a good shot, it was just over
Kim’s head.”

According to Coach Toby
Lovecchio, “it’s difficult to get
behind 2-0 and that’s what we’ve
done all three of our games.” How-
ever, Bucknell took advantage of
an opportunity given to them in the
second half when the ball was
kicked out of bounds by the Blue
Hens. Forward Krause was able to
score off a corner kick at 21:36,
closing the gap to 2-1. According
to both Esse and Krause, the Lady
Bison played sluggishly in the first
half, but improved as the game
went on, until the Blue Hens
secured the game with an insurance
goal late in the contest, giving Del-
aware a 3-1 victory. Krause felt
that even though Bucknell lost the
game, “it was pretty even in the

second half. We put more pressure
on them.”

Although Lovecchio feels
that Delaware played a better game
and deserved to win, he is not dis-
couraged. “I have confidence in our
team,” he said. “They’re working
hard, they don’t give up, they try
hard and want to win.” He added
that the squad is improving with
each game it plays.

Esse feels that part of the
problem is lack of confidence. “It’s
just a mental problem,” said Esse.
“But we’re really up and we know
we've been improving a lot. We’ve
just played three really good
teams.”

One definite major problem
that the Lady Bison are having is
the lack of speed. This week,
Lovecchio has tried different work-
outs in order to teach his team other
things that will hopefully make up
for the speed deficiency. He wants
the team “to be able to think before
the other team can react fast
enough. We might not be faster but
we can be quicker in movements.”
He added, “it’s tough to replace

speed—we’ll do it any way we
can.

The Delaware game was very
difficult for the defensive players,
who were continually being chal-
lenged. Lovecchio commented,
“they were doing all they could do,
but to keep it up for 90 minutes is
tough.”

Goalkeeper Fekel played an
outstanding game with 18 saves.
Lovecchio also added that right
back Genine Streeper ‘92, who had
recently been injured, played an
excellent game as well. Lovecchio
feels that the team has to work on
stopping high shots, or eliminate
those shots entirely. “The team is
young,” he said, “and a lot of
things I’m trying to teach them are
new to them. I’m impressed with
the way some girls have picked
their game up a notch—if they all
can do that it'll help.”

Looking ahead to tomorrow
at Penn, the Quakers are the only
Ivy League school with a non-
varsity women’s soccer team,
although Lovecchio feels that they
will be very competitive.

‘96 Summer games

By Mark Abrahamsen
Staff Writer

Atlanta was awarded the
1996 Summer Olympics at an
announcement made in Tokyo
Tuesday by International Olympic
Committee President Juan Antonio
Samaranch. The decision marks
the third time in 16 years that the
United States will host an Olympic
Games. Lake Placid was the home
for the Winter Games in 1980,
highlighted by America’s “Miracle
on Ice;” Los Angeles was the site
for the 1984 Summer Games,
memorable for Carl Lewis’ four
Gold Medals, Mary Lou Retton’s
gymnastics triumph, and the U.S.
basketball team steamrolling past
opponents on its way to easily win-
ning the Gold Medal.

As Atlantans partied in the
streets of the city’s Underground
entertainment and shopping com-
plex, Mayor Maynard Jackson pro-
claimed, “I feel like an exclama-
tion point has just been placed on
the life of our city. We won’t let
the world down.”

Auanta’s effort began in
1988, when the United States
Olympic Committee chose the
“capital of the South” over Minne-
apolis-St. Paul. Getting the Games
concluded nearly three years of
intense lobbying and cost Atlanta
over $7 million, but that invest-

Volleyball

By the time the Cleveland
State game rolled around fatigue
had caught up with the Lady Bison.
Bucknell could only muster one
block the entire match. They also
ran into problems passing the ball
which negated the effectiveness of
the 6-2 offense, plus they encoun-
tered some problems at the line as
they gave up seven service errors in
the match.

*The team's attitude is really
Positive and we're playing together
a lot better, plus our new offense
makes us quite varied. All we need
to do is improve upon our serve
receive and try to keep our emo-
tional level consistently high."

Individual leaders for the
tournament were Forosisky who
compiled 31 kills over the tourna-
ment and had a 23% hitting per-
centage. Forosisky was also the
only Lady Bison named to the all
tournament team. Sullivan also had
a strong toumament as_ she
recorded 24 kills and a 36% hitting

ment turned out to be a bargain.
The announcement will generate
approximately $3.5 billion into
the state’s economy. For a sum-
mer fortnight over half a million
spectators, 16,500 athletes and
coaches, and 6,000 journalists
will attend the festivities.

The southern mecca had
been locked in a battle with five
other citics trying to receive the
bid: Athens, Greece; Toronto,
Canada; Belgrade, Yugoslavia;
Melbourne, Australia; and Man-
chester, England.

In addition to having access
to the Omni and Fulton-County
Stadium, the city has many new
facilitics currently under construc
tion or in the works to be built
before ‘96. A 75,000-seat Georgia
Dome will house basketball and
gymnastics; an Olympic Stadium
accommodating the opening/
closing ceremonies, equestrian,
soccer, and track and field will
seat 85,000; a natatorium for
swimming and diving; and a velo-
drome for cycling.

The IOC’s decision ended
any serious hopes for Salt Lake
City’s bid for hosting the Winter
Games in 1998 (to be announced
in 1991), as Olympic officials
have traditionally been hesitant
for awarding the Games to the
same country in back-to-back
Olympics.

percentage. Scinta and Jordan
combined for 78 assists on the
tournament.

On Tuesday the Lady Bison
uied to rebound from the long
weekend in a match against the
University of Maryland in Balti-
more County. Bucknell wasn't on
top of its game, however, as they
fell to UMBC 15-6 15-10 15-8.
Coach Opalski was forced to go
back to the 5-1 offense as Bucknell
couldn't get its passing game going
the first two games. In the third
game, Bucknell held off UMBC at
10-6 when Colbert came up with
three straight blocks, but the Lady
Bison couldn't get their serving
game going as they struggled with
a 30% point/serve ratio.

"You can't win serving
30%," sad Opalski. "I feel we
played a little better than the scores
indicate. UMBC is a strong club
which executes very well. We've
got a week to rest and work on
things before we play Villanova, so
I think we'll be in good shape.”

Staff Writer

Bucknell scored ten points in
the second half off two Lafayette
turnovers to win 24-14 in its first
Patriot League match-up of the
season.

The victory, which moved
the Bison to 1-1 overall, was
sparked by a ball control ground
game and a solid defensive effort

The Bison backfield rushed
for a total of 272 yards, led by
Brian Henesey ‘92, who ran for
103 yards, and Craig Cavlovic ‘91,
who rushed for 87 yards on just 14
carries in his first game at fullback
after being moved from linebacker.

Coach Lou Maranzana
assessed the move by saying ‘“‘Cav-
lovic played fullback in the pre-
season, and Jeff Wall ‘93 and Char
ron Anderson ‘93 were banged up.
He did well in there and sparked
the offense in practice. We started

the game with it, and it worked
well.”

Bucknell struck first in the
contest with a 63-yard drive in five
plays. The score came on a 15-yard
pass play from Todd Hatajik ‘91 to
a wide-open Matt Walsh ‘93, who
scampered down the sideline for
the touchdown. That made the
score 7-0 with 8:10 to go in the first
quarter. The touchdown pass was
set up by four straight running
plays, including a 13-yard sweep
by Walsh, and a 32-yard gain up
the middle by Cavlovic to Lafay-
ette’s 18-yard line.

Following unsuccessful
drives by both teams, Lafayette
took the ball on Bucknell’s 42-yard
line. Tom Costello, the Leopards’
leading rusher, took a pass from
quarterback Tom Kirchhoff and
broke a tackle before he was even-
tually brought down on the six-yard
line. Three plays later, Kirchhoff
again connected, this time on a 7-

Student seating changed

With the move of the football team to the west (pressbox)
side of the field for this season, there has been some confusion as to
where spectators are allowed to sit. There is not a “home” side of
Christy Mathewson Memorial Stadium. Because we need to meet
the seating needs of several groups of people, and because nearly all
of these people want the prime, 50 yard line location, it is not possi-
ble to designate a home or visitor side.

It has been my contention that Bucknell students should be
given the very best seats available for watching games. This policy
is unique to Bucknell. In an effort to give students the best seats pos-
sible, and to meet demands of alumni, friends of Bucknell, visiting
team fans, and special groups, we decided that the students would
most likely prefer the sections R, S, T, U, and V on the east side of
the stadium. An “informal” poll confirmed this decision. These seats
are from the 50 yard line to the goalline. However, now it seems that
the cheerleaders and others have decided that everyone should sit
behind the football team on the west side of the stadium. We have
sold all of the reserved seats on the west side of the stadium for four
of the remaining five home games. For this reason, students are
encouraged to sit on the east side, as they have in the past few years,
in sections at midfield designated solely for students.

Should students or others admitted free with I.D. wish to sit
on the west side, they will not be permitted to sit in the reserved sec-
tions C, D, E, F, G. The far end sections of the west side (A, B, H, J)
are the only sections available for upcoming games. Ushers will be

present to assist spectators.

Your support of the football team and the athletic program is

greatly appreciated.

yard touchdown to Dave Baird to
tie the score at seven with 3:48 left
to play in the first quarter.

That ended the scoring in a
first period which was completely
dominated by the Bison. They
amassed 125 yards on the ground
while holding the ball for over ten
and a half minutes of the quarter.

The second quarter was
rather uneventful until, with just
over five minutes left in the half,
Lafayette’s Jim Hodson missed a
44 yard field goal wide to the left.

Bucknell took possession and
Hatajik completed a 20-yard strike
up the middle to Jeff Pape ‘92. But
two plays later, Dennis Barnes ‘91
fumbled after catching a Hatajik
pass.

Lafayette recovered the ball
on its own 46-yard line and went
five plays in 43 seconds for its sec-
ond touchdown of the afternoon.
All of the yardage came via the
pass, with the last a six-yarder
caught by Dave Duer in the midst
of three Bison defenders in the end
zone.

Bucknell regained posses-
sion, down 14-7, with just over a
minute to play. The kickoff was
fumbled initially by Cavlovic but
picked up by Dan Scocca ‘91, who
returned the ball to the 39. Hatajik
began the “two-minute drill” with
two short completions to Bames
and Scocca of nine and eight yards
respectively.

After an overthrown ball,
Hatajik dropped back, scrambled
left and hit Scocca for a 23-yard
gain. Bucknell used a time out to
stop the clock and discuss strategy.
The decision worked perfectly as
Hatajik, on a play action fake to
Walsh, connected with Lester Erb
“91 in the left corner of the end
zone for a 21-yard touchdown to tie
the game at fourteen with only 16
seconds left in the half.

The Bison run defense per-
formed admirably in the first half,
as the Leopards were held to just
12 yards rushing on 11 attempts.

Coach Maranzana was ini-
tially concerned that the defense
wouldn’t play well after Cavlovic,
the leading tackler last year, was
moved to offense. “The defense
would certainly suffer without him.
There was slack to be taken up, but
we were pleased with the way
Kevin Kane ‘93 played last week,
and there were other linebackers
that can help us. It also helps us
that our defensive line continues to
improve.”

While the third quarter did

not produce any score, Bucknell
played opportunistically in the
fourth quarter. Bill Higgins ‘91
intercepted a Kirchhoff pass at the
Bison two-yard line and returned it
23 yards to the Bucknell 25. The
Bison then ate up 8:07 on the clock
using 17 plays to eventually take
the lead 21-14 when Hatajik rolled
right and connected with Pape for a
four-yard TD.

The completion was Hata-
jik’s third touchdown pass of the
day. Bucknell again intercepted
Kirchhoff just three plays later. The

hero this time was Trevor Smith
‘91, who had also intercepted a
pass earlier in the day.

The Bison took possession at
Lafayette’s 38-yard-line and drove
down to the 13. The drive was
sparked by Walsh, who found a
hole up the middle before cutting
right and gaining 13 yards on the
play. The Bison eventually capital-
ized off the Leopard miscue as
Todd Krutchkoff ‘91 nailed a 30
yard field goal to give the Bison a
24-14 win.

Bucknell will be at home

tomorrow to face Columbia Univer-
sity. Last year, the Bison won eas-
ily 27-12 on the road and are
favored again in this year’s contest.
Cavlovic believes that an effort
similar to the one against Lafayette
will provide a victory. “The team
looks good. We’ve got to go out
and be physical like we did last
week,” he said. Coach Maranzana
believes that “Columbia improved
dramatically in the past two years.
We have had tough games against
them in the past, and the team is
hungry to get a win.”

Cross-country’s dual-meet
win streak ends after 16 years

By Jennifer Walsh

The Bucknell men’s and
women’s cross-country teams both
exhaled a sigh of disappointment
after last Saturday’s meets while
they inhaled a breath of determina-
tion to carry them through the rest
of their season, as the men lost to a
phenomenal team from UConn, and
the women dropped races to both
George Mason and UConn.

For the men’s team, the loss
was particularly frustrating and his-
toric, as it marked the first time that
a Bison cross-country team did not
win a dual-meet in 16 years. The
dynasty ended following167 con-
secutive victories in dual-meets.
The Bison lost to UConn 36-22,
while also defeating Manhattan and
Rutgers by identical 15-50 scores.
UConn posted the top three finish-
ers, with runner Andy Ball coming
in first overall with a time of 25:04.
Jason Cahilly ‘92 was the leading
Bucknell finisher, arriving fourth at
the finish line, thirteen seconds
behind Ball. Following Cahilly
were teammates Matt Deardoff ‘92
and Norbert Berenyi ‘91, who fin-
ished fifth and sixth, respectively.

Naturally, one of the major
concerns now facing the men’s
team after its loss pertains to how
they will handle the defeat, and
what possible influence it will have
on the rest of its season.

Cahilly said, “The race and
streak are over, past, gone, history,
old news. We’ve got to look ahead.
We've got some big meets coming
up, and we have to look at the
future.”

Cross-country Coach Art

Gulden also expressed the idea that
the most important thing is to get
on with the season.

“The streak isn’t very impor-
tant,” stated Gulden, “‘because all
early meets are just preparation for
later on in the season. I’m not
excited about losing to UConn, but
the world didn’t end for me or for
the team. I think the key to this race
will be how we react to the loss.”

Gulden also stressed the need
to put things in proper perspective.

“Most people don’t know
how good they (UConn) really are.
They’re at least one of the top ten
in the nation, and I think the only
people who realize right now just
how good they are, are their coach
and me.”

Among other positive factors
from the race, Gulden also cited
that UConn, not an East Coast Con-
ference member, is not Bucknell’s
primary competition. According to
Gulden, “It’s only important to beat
them in November to avenge our
loss. Will they still be this much
better than us in November? No.
We'll be a whole lot closer.”

Saturday’s meet was a bit of
a surprise for the Lady Bison, as
teams from UConn and George
Mason defeated Bucknell 29-27
and 33-22, respectively.

“We were pretty close to
George Mason—we probably
should’ve beat them. UConn sur-
prised us. We didn’t think they
were that good,” commented Gul-
den. He also remarked that Buck-
nell runner Kelly Marsh ‘91 had
run very well for her team, but
again stressed that the reaction to
the loss will be the most important

factor in determining the outcome
for the rest of the season.

“We need to run tougher in
the middle of the race, and I think
they realize that. If we can learn
from that, then that’s the significant
point,” said Gulden. “We took a
Test in the middle—sort of like
what happened in the guys’ race.
But we don’t train for now, we
train for November. Now that
we’ ve learned, it’s how we react.”

Marsh, who placed third
overall for Bucknell with a time of
18:29, said that the Lady Bison
could improve upon by running
together as a team.

“The coaches are geared
towards getting us ready for Octo-
ber rather than for the first meet in
September,” commented Marsh.
“And I'd rather be running fast at
Easterns than now. Every single
person can contribute. The coaches
have told us ‘there’s no dead wood
on this team,’ and | think that’s
great.”

The cross-country teams do
not race again until Saturday, Sept.
29, at the West Virginia Invita-
tional. They will face competition
against many teams, including
Ohio State, Kent State, Pittsburgh,
and West Virginia.

“Our schedule doesn’t get
any casicr,” said Gulden. “We have

a major test every two weeks—our *

most difficult schedule ever. We
must improve every week.”

Gulden singled out Pitts-
burgh as one of the toughest teams
that the men will face in the next
meet, while both Pittsburgh and
West Virginia should provide a
strong challenge for the women.

Men’s soccer suffers first defeat

By Chad Bown

The men’s soccer team
started the week off well with a 1-0
win over Lehigh on Saturday
before suffering their first defeat of
the season, a 3-0 loss to Drexel on
Tuesday.

The Bison travelled to Beth-
Iehem, Pennsylvania last Saturday
to face Patriot League rival Lehigh.
The teams played to an even score
in the first half, with Bucknell find-
ing itself in control of most of the
action, yet unable to capitalize on
any scoring opportunities.

Forward Dave Moser ‘91
scored the lone goal for Bucknell
early in the second half on a quick
drive that found the ball nestled
cleanly in the upper right hand cor-
ner of the Lehigh net.

The team then struggled
through the rest of the second half
but managed to hang on for the
victory.

“We were lucky in that we
were outplayed for a good bit of the
second half,” said Coach Reynolds.
“We need to apply and sustain bet-
ter pressure of our own over the
full ninety minutes.”

Bad luck finally caught up to
the Bison on Tuesday in the form
of Drexel University. Bucknell con-
tinued its road trip with a stop in
Philadelphia to play what Reynolds
called “a good team that came at us
hard.”

“We hung in there tough in the first
half,” continued Reynolds, “‘but we
were flat.” The score approaching
halftime was still 0-0, and the team
was in pretty good shape. Had it
not been for a tough break when a
Ken Gulick ‘91 shot on goal hit the
post, the Bison may have found
themselves with a lead and the
momentum heading into the second
half.

Early in the second half, goal
keeper Mark Wrigley ‘94 lost his
footing on the slick turf and
allowed the first goal scored by a
Bucknell opponent this season.

It gave Drexel a 1-0 lead and
proved to be the only score the
team would need. Drexel added
two more goals later in the game to
seal the victory.

“Only a couple of our
players played a real, solid game,”
indicated Reynolds. “Next to
[Chad] Hellman [‘91], [Brandon]
Poe [‘91], and [Kirk] Lorie [‘91],
we didn’t play up to our potential.”

“Maybe the loss will open
our eyes to some of our weak-
nesses,” Reynolds continued. “We
make too many unnecessary tumo-
vers and we have poor ball control.
We need to improve our heading
technique and we have to have
more movement off the ball.”

“We need better leadership
from a few of the players on the
team,” Reynolds said. “Besides the
captains, we need some of the

younger guys to step in and
encourage each other. We need to
take a more positive approach to
some of our games this season.”
When asked about tomor-

row’s game with Holy Cross in
Worcester, Massachusetts, Rey-
nolds was a bit skeptical.

Jan plan changes propose

Faculty to consider alternatives Monday

By Steve Firestone

The January Program, after
drawing criticism for low partici-
pation levels, appears to be headed
for major changes which would
include an alteration of the present
“partially voluntary” status of the
program. The changes which may
be instituted result from statistics
unearthed in the March 1990
Interim Report and a subsequent
recommendation by the Commit-
tee on Instruction (COI) to stimu-
late the program from several
directions.

The Committee on Instruc-
tion’s attempts to amend the defi-
ciencies in the current program

stem from what chairperson Andrea
Halpern, associate professor of psy

chology, termed “severe problems”
with participation on the part of
both the
faculty. Although figures from the
1990 January Program were una:
vailable, the 1989 figures show that
35% of Bucknell students partici-
pated in the program; the lowest
rate was found among seniors, only
21% of whom participated.

BSG ban on chalk
writing rescinded

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

After more than an hour of
vigorous debate, the Bucknell Stu-
dent Government overturned its
previous resolution to ban writing
in chalk on the University’s side-
walks. While the BSG did decide
not to act against such ‘“chalk-
talk,” it did pass a resolution to
charge a committee with consider-
ing whether it should recommend
criteria by which the practice of
sidewalk chalking can continue at
Bucknell.

The elimination of chalk-talk
on the grounds that it was graffiu
and detracted from the aesthetic
appeal of the campus had been the
object of junior class representa-
tive Keith Eisenstein’s motion that
was passed on Sept. 17.

The motion to rescind Eisen-
stein’s resolution passed the con-
gress on Sunday night in a roll call
vote—twenty one votes to ten with
six abstentions. Such a motion,
according to Dave Skena ‘91, pres-
ident of the BSG, means that
Eisenstein’s motion or one resem-
bling it cannot be brought before
the congress again.

The other related motion
which passed the congress pertain-
ing to chalk-talk resolved to
“assign [the] Students Affairs
[committee] with the responsibility
of creating criteria, if any, for
chalk writing and have them bring
back their criteria, if any, for BSG

approval.” The rationale for the
motion, according to its author, rep-
resentative Rick Scott ‘93, was to
address BSG and campus concerns
that “chalk writing not get out of
control.”

The debate on the rectitude of
banning chalk-talk was renewed by
junior class representative Brian
Selmeski when he put forward a
motion to rescind the previous
week’s resolution which had passed
by fourteen votes to ten with three
abstentions.

Selmeski, who had suggested
that he might resign from the BSG
if Eisenstein resolution stood, said
of this Sunday’s vote, “I am
pleased and impressed with the
congresses’ performance tonight. I
pleased that I can continue to be a
representative with a _ clear
conscience.”

In passing _Eiisenstein’s
motion on Sept. 17, Selmeski said
that he believed that the BSG had
acted too hastily on an issue that
demanded serious discussion.

(The reconsideration of
Eisenstein’s resolution had to be
initiated under a motion to rescind,
since according to the parliamen-
tary procedure by which the BSG
conducts its proceedings, a motion
to reconsider is only possible dur-
ing the meeting in which the resolu-
tion in question was passed. As a
result, the new freshman represen-
tatives were able to vote on the sub-

Greeks blame Security,
administration for abuses

By Lisa Hirschkorn
Staff Writer

Students are voicing increas-
ing discontent over the University’s
enforcement of the alcohol policy.
With a slumping morale, Greeks
are frustrated by recent actions
taken by the Office of Security and
Safety as well as the administra-
tion. The fraternity houses are
being charged amidst “ridiculous”
searches, unreasonable demands,
and delayed adjudications.

Brent Edmonds ‘91, president
of Lambda Chi Alpha, explained
that his fraternity has endured two
incidents that “‘were fairly ridicu-
lous.” According to Edmonds, it
was last semester during a talent
show that “security came through
our house seven times in the course
of three hours. You would think
that after the second or third time
they would realize that we were
just having a talent show and noth-
ing was going on.”

John P. Dunlop, dean of stu-
dents, explained that the adminis-

ration has no knowledge of such
yecurrences. “The reports never

ested anything like that. There
was never anything that I read that
hints that that kind of thing has
happened.

Additionally, Edmonds spoke
f another incident at a party during
the first week of school when “one

the Security Officers went up to
third floor and demanded to go

) a back bathroom. We told her

t there was nothing going on in
bathroom and to go ahead and

st us...that even if. we wanted to

e couldn’t really fit anything in
that bathroom, it’s a private area.
And she said no, ‘I want to get in
there and see it.’ So I opened the
door for her, and there was nothing
in there. There was just a brother in
the process of going to the bath-
room. She just said ‘ok’ and left. It

didn’t even phase her that it was a
men’s bathroom.”

Mike Amarante, interim
director of security and safety,
defended the officer’s actions by
explaining that the officer was
investigating “‘a public bathroom, it
wasn’t private so we have to check
it, and we have found kegs in bath-
rooms before...We don’t go into
private areas, and it just so happens
it was a female officer.”

There are also reports of
Security entering closed rooms.
Sigma Alpha Mu president Trevor
Stoyer ‘92 reported that two secur-
ity officers opened “a few” closed
doors and entered rooms around 7
p.m. on a weekday two weeks ago.
The brothers, who were upstairs in
the living room, did not see security

enter the premises initially but after
seeing the car parked outside “one
of the brothers came downstairs
and asked them ‘what are you
doing?’ As soon as they were con-
fronted the security guards said
‘we’re just looking around’ and
they left. The older officer did
mention something about a new
security guard but that was it.”

Responding to this policy of
opening doors, Dunlop said, “I
haven’t heard about opening any
private room doors but the rule
with them is reasonable cause. You
don’t even try to gain access into a
private room unless you have rea-
sonable cause to believe that a uni-
versity policy or regulation or state
law is being violated

Hazardous waste incinerator
proposed for Union County

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

After weeks of public spect
lation,
announced last Friday for the con
struction of a hazardous
incinerator in the
Industrial Park in Gregg Township,
near the village of Allenwood. The
site, in northem Union county, is
approximately seven miles north of
the Bucknell campus. A citizens
group, the Organization United for
Ecology (QUE) has
block the construction of the incin-
erator, and enjoys the support of
many of Union County’s
officials.

The group, headed by Clyde
Peeling, local and the
owner of Reptileland, held an inter-
est and organizational meeting on
Sept. 17. A standing-room-only
crowd which spilled outside the
doors of the Allenwood Fire Hall
was shown a videotape document-
ing health problems at two hazard-
ous waste incinerators and was
urged to bring other residents into
the group and to contact govern-
ment officials.

Plans for the incinerator have
been rumored since last month,
when the Pennwood Construction
Company, based in Philadelphia,
began purchasing land for the pro-
posed 700 acre industrial park,
located between Route 15 and the
Susquehanna River. U.S. Pollution
Control Inc. (USPCI), a Houston-
based subsidiary of Union Pacific
Corp., announced Friday that it has
purchased Pennwood’s interest in
the park for $6 million and will
construct a hazardous waste inciner-
ator on the northemmost 400 acres
of the site, with a total capacity of

75,000 tons of waste per year.
According to a USPCI spokesman,
the $100 million project is expected
to generate up to 200 jobs.

The company has also been
negotiating with several groups to
purchase railroad right-of-ways in
the area, since plans call for most
of the waste to be shipped to the
plant in railroad cars. The company
has purchased three miles of track,
and is negotiating for another four-
and-one-half mile section needed to
link the incinerator to Conrail’s
Buffalo to Harrisburg line. The
route would carry rail cars loaded
with hazardous material through
Sunbury, Milton, West Milton and
New Columbia on their way to the
plant.

Opposition Lines Up

In early September the Gregg
Township supervisors passed a
motion opposing the construction
of the incinerator, The Union
County Commissioners have also
voiced opposition to the project,
along with Bob Garrett, director of
the Union County economic devel-
opment council. Garrett addressed
the Sept. 17 OUE meeting, raising
several concerns. Garrett read a
prepared statement, since he said
that he had been threatened with a
lawsuit by USPCI if he publicly
attacked the company. Garrett said
there has been a great deal of inter-
est by a wide range of businesses in
the industrial park, and that “we
need not accept an unwanted com-
pany” at the site. Garrett is con-
cerned that the project “may inspire
more of the same” kind of projects
in the area, which is near Interstate
80; the highway has been dubbed
“trash alley” because of the large
volume of waste transported from

that the motivation and purpose of
the program would be changed
According to Steven Becker, pro-
fessor of physics, “At present, stu-
dents in Jan Plans are there because
they choose to be; this proposal
will change the tone of the January
program.” He, along with Owen
Floody, chair and professor of psy-
chology, and others, also take issue
with the resulting size of classes
during the term if attendance were
mandatory. Floody stated, “Assum-
ing minimal participation, we’ll

third of the faculty at work during

average out to about 30 students

would ruin one of the goals of the
Jan Plans: intimacy with students.
Halpern answered these concerns,
stating, “There is really no change
in what is expected of the faculty,
but faculty are being asked to take

Class of ‘95 would have to com-
plete at Ieast one January Program
as a requirement for graduation. All
classes thereafter would be required
to complete at least two programs
which would yield a “physical
result” (ie. a paper, performance,
or written reflection).

Also important to students
would be the proposed change in
the length of the program. The COI
recommended that the term be cut
down to approximately three weeks
to combat the problems Bucknell
students traditionally face in enter-
ing the job market later in the sum-
mer than students at other universi-
ues. To add further credibility, the
Director of the January Program
would be given faculty status and
would oversee the functions of a
new committee which would be
designed to assist the director.

The sweeping changes in the
Jan Plan could be adopted into pol-
icy as early as the next faculty

The Bucknellian

Petition Demanding Justice for Students

“Bucknell’s residential character provides a setting for institu-
tional programs and practices that exemplify compassion, civility, and
a sense of justice.”

We feel that these ideals, from the University’s Mission State-
ment, do not exemplify the University’s current practices towards stu-
dents and their organizations. There exists a double standard regard-
ing the treatment of and unreasonable sanctions against different
organizations, as well as a prevailing attitude that students are ‘guilty
until proven innocent.’ Furthermore, our personal freedoms are being
violated by the continual and unfounded harassment by some unsym-
pathetic administrators. Finally, the administration grants no effective
power to student regulatory agencies.

We the undersigned, believe the above statements reflect that
our basic rights as students and citizens are being violated, and that
Bucknell is not upholding its Mission Statement.

If what happened on your inside
happened on your outside, would you still smoke?

Chi Phi boycotts

By Darren Millman
Staff Writer

As the Senior Gift Drive
approaches the $30,000 mark,
program organizers optimistically
hope to make the goal of
$115,000 a reality. One member
of the Class of 1991, Travis
Barry, is determined to do his
part to ensure that the gift drive
does not live up to its supporters’
expectations.

Barry, a member of Chi Phi
Fraternity, has drafted a policy
statement echoing the sentiments
of the ten other members of the
Chi Phi Class of 1991 (see Let-
ters to the Editor, page 10). This
statement describes the group’s
intention to abstain from contrib-
uting towards the gift drive. The
rationale behind this decision,
continues the statement, is to
send a message to the University
that it would be nonsensical for
the Chi Phi Class of 1991 to con-
tribute towards an_ institution
which, according to Barry, is
determined to realize “the even-
tual destruction of the Greek
System.”

While attempting to explain
the emotional motivation behind
this action, Barry made it clear
that it is not a personal vendetta.
“We've got nothing against the
gift drive, per se,” he stated, “and
nothing against any of the people
working for [the gift drive]. We
really don’t have anything
against the University, as such.
We are simply trying to make a
statement, and we feel this is a
powerful way of doing that.”

When asked to clarify pre-
cisely what the desired message
the Chi Phi group would like to
send to the University, Barry
responded by stating that “should
the University continue with
these activities so clearly aimed
at the Bucknell Greek System,

real hell is going to break loose,
and [the University] is going to
pay for it where it hurts them
most.”

The Chi Phi group’s aspira-
tions clearly go beyond their per-
sonal boycott. It is their hope that
the campus’ Greek population,
approximately 60% of the under-
graduate enrollment, will join in
their effort to make a statement.

Darren Shaw ‘91, one of
the gift drive’s Area Coordina-
tors, as well. as a member of
Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity,
reacted to the Chi Phi letter by
explaining that while he, and oth-
ers working in support of the gift
drive, would like to see 100%
participation, they understand it is
a personal decision each member
of the class must make.

In response to Barry’s com-
ments regarding the University’s
attitude towards the Greek Sys-
tem, Shaw stated, “I too am frus-
trated with some of the adminis-
tration’s policies against the
Greek community, but I person-
ally can recognize the benefits of
a Bucknell education.”

“Tam proud to be a member
of the Greek community”, contin-
ued Shaw, “but I feel it is narrow-
minded to believe that being
Greek is the only reason for being
on the Bucknell campus.”

Mike Dominguez ‘91, Inter-
fraternity Council president, said
that IFC had no plans to discuss
the Chi Phi action, since IFC con-
siders the decision to participate
in the gift drive to be purely per-
sonal. Samantha Gladish ‘91,
Panhellic Council president, said
that she received a copy of
Barry’s letter late this week, but
that she knows of no similar
actions planned by sorority mem-
bers. Gladish said that the subject
“would probably be brought up”
at Panhel’s weekly meeting on
Tuesday.

The Bucknellian

Student mistakenly interrogated
Senior Gift Drive | by policein fake ID case

Freshman read his rights by police at Security Office

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

The East Buffalo Township
Police with the assistance of the
Office of Security and Safety, has
concluded an investigation into a
misrepresentation of age case that
involved the interrogation of three
Bucknell freshmen. One of those
interrogated, David Barry ‘94, was
falsely accused of the offense.

According to Barry, he was
called by Security and “they told
me to come down... [When] I asked
why they said ‘I’m just a dis-
patcher’ and they didn’t even tell
me.” But Barry figured that “it was
something routine” and was not
worried.

According to Barry, “when I
got there, there was an East Buffalo
Township [officer] with two secur-
ity agents.” Understandably sur-
prised by the situation, Barry said
“May I ask what’s going on?’ And
then they [Officer Robert Huffman,
Patrolman for East Buffalo Town-
ship Police] read me my rights.”

Lewisburg District Attorney
Graham Showalter’ explained that
reading someone his or her rights is
“up to the officer to determine,” but
“generally, it’s when your in cus-
tody,” that is, when “you're
restricted in where you can go.” It
is unclear as to whether Barry was
indeed in custody, but according to
Barry, “It phased me, but I knew
that’s what they had to do.”

Barry explained that, after
being read his rights Huffman
“handed me an ID, and he said
‘that’s you,’ and I said no that’s
not. [Then he asked me] ‘Where
were you tonight?’” Barry
explained that he could account for
all of his hours and “would even
give proof if you want.”

At this point, according to
Barry, “He [Huffman] handed the
Picture around to the two security
agents and they said ‘that might be
him and that might not be him.’”

“Then the policeman told me
since it’s my first offense that if I
come clean now they’ll go light on
me,” Barry said. However, he

maintained his innocence and told
Huffman, “‘Don’t even bother tell-
ing me that because I don’t care
cause I didn’t do that.’”

After this Barry was let go,
but told that the police would be
back in touch with him “because
the investigation was still continu-
ing.” Although the police did catch
the real offender, who was fined
$350 and had his driver’s license
suspended for 90 days, Barry has
not been informed that he is no
longer a suspect. “It’s been a week
and they still haven’t gotten in
touch with me... If I didn’t know
{that the case had been closed] I
would still be wondering if I was
under suspicion.”

As for Security’s limited role,
Mike Amarante, interim director of
Security and Safety, explained that
it is standard procedure for the
police to question students sus-
pected by the police at the Security
Office, since that would be less har-
rowing than being taken to the
police station in town,

Barry noted that Security was

very compassionate for the most
part. “I thought they were decent
about it, but they shouldn’t have let
him [Huffman] do that to me.”

Huffman refused to com-
ment on “any aspects of the inves-
tigation because that’s privileged
information.” But he did explain
the error by saying, “He strongly
resembled the guy who committed
the offense.”

Huffman explained that the
error could have “possibly”
occurred when the police were
given the false identification by the
Beer Barn. The name on the identi-
fication was Ted Barry. David
Barry believes that the police
checked under the last name
“Barry” in the freshman directory
and saw that he resembled the pic-
ture on the ID.

The police did a license plate
check on the car which was at the
Beer Barn. After locating and
interrogating the driver, police
caught the real perpetrator, Ted
Berry ‘94, four hours after Barry
was interrogated. Ted Berry has
since transferred

Gorbachev gets
new powers

The Supreme Soviet granted
President Mikhail Gorbachev emer-
gency economic powers Monday,
despite warnings from Russian
republic leaders that they will not
tollerate any infringement on their
sovereign rights.

Gorbachev argued that he
needed the special powers to pull
the nation out of its economic
crisis.

The Soviet president now has
the authority to implement wage,
price, budget, and finance policies.
The Supreme Soviet could chal-
lenge the directives, but its
approval is not required

Iraq prepares
for chem. attack

Iraq has prepared chemical
decontamination sites along its
southern border in the event of a
chemical weapons attack, accord-
ing to American intelligence
reports.

The sites, numbering about
six, are to the north of the Kuwaiti
border. The facilities are designed
to decontaminate vehicles and per-
sonnel, enabling Iraq to handle a
large number of forces if attacked.

A Bush admnistration official
said the conspicuous nature of the
facilities may be designed to send a
signal to discourage military action
to push Iraq from Kuwait.

Bush urges
sanctions be
suspended

President Bush told South
African President F. W. de Klerk
that he would attempt to get Con-
gress to modify or suspend sanc-
tions against South Africa.

According to the sanctions
legislation, the president may seek
to modify or suspend the sanctions
if four of the five conditions set by
the law are met. So far the South
African government has lifted the
ban on democratic parties and
entered negotiations with black
leaders, fulfilling two conditions.
The Bush administration hopes that
in the next few months South
Africa will meet two more condi-
tions: freeing all political prisoners
and ending the state of emergency
in Natal province.

During his meeting with Con-
gressional leaders, de Klerk said
that he wants to build an American
style constitution for his nation,

with the principle of one man, one
vote.

Air blockade
around Iraq
begun

The United Nations Security
Council voted Tuesday to further
tighten the blockade against Iraq by
imposing an air blockade. The vote

was 14-1. Cuba cast the only dis-
senting vote.

Thirteen of the fifteen Secur-
ity Council delegations were
headed by their countries’ foreign
ministers, a gesture intended to
demonstrate the seriousness of the
vote to Iraq.

The resolution cuts Iraq’s air-
line links with the rest of the world,
except those the Security Council
approves for humanitarian reasons.
The resolution also authorizes
detention of Iraq’s merchant fleet.

Teen parents
cost U.S. $22B

Teenage pregnancy cost the
federal government about $22 bil-
lion in welfare payments last year,
according to a study released
Monday.

The government, through
food stamps, welfare, and Medicaid
benefits, spent $21.55 billion in

1989 for familics in which the
mother was a teenager. Close to 9
million adults and children were in
such families.

According to the report,
about one-third of all families that
started with a teenage birth ended
up on public assistance. The study
covered families that had a birth to
a teenager even if the birth took
place several years ago.

Leaders prepare
to miss budget
deadline

The White House and con-
gressional Democrats prepared sce-
narios this weck to keep the federal
government running when the new
fiscal year begins Monday and to
turn the automatiic spending cuts
into an advantage. President Bush
said he would veto any extension of
the October 1 deadline of the cuts.

Bush planned to use an
obscure legal opinion, issued duri-
ing the Carter administration, to
keep "essential services" running,
even though there is no money to
pay for them. This plan, given to
Senate Republicans in a meeting
with Chief of Staff John Sununu,
was greeted with criticism from
Senators who claimed this was an
intrusion of Congress's constitu-
tional spending power.

EATING
RIGHT
CAN HELP
REDUCE
THE RISK

And since a 12-year study shows that being 40%
or more overweight puts you at high risk, it makes
sense to follow these guidelines for healthy living!

Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables rich in
vitamins A and C—oranges, cantaloupe,
strawberries, peaches, apricots, broccoli,
Cauliflower, brussel sprouts, cabbage.

Eat a high-fiber, low-fat diet that includes
whole-grain breads and cereals such as
oatmeal, bran and wheat. Eat lean meats, fish,
skinned poultry and low-fat dairy products.
Drink alcoholic beverages only in moderation.

From page 1

According to Charlotte
Jacobsen Weddle, associate vice-
president for student life, Security
has both a “monitoring role” and
“special responsibilities” that are
“determined by the Director of
Security and Safety. Security has
the responsibility to take control
twenty-four hours
a day, seven days
a week. They have
the responsibility
to enforce Univer-
sity policy, which
often means tak-
ing extra
precautions.”

Other _ inci-
dents where stu-
dents feel that
Security has over-
Stepped its bounds
were reported by
Tau Kappa Epsi-
lon and Kappa
Sigma. Mark
Roessler ‘92, pres-
ident of TKE
reported that
Security walked
into TKE during a
weekend night
when the house
was empty and
entered a closed
room. “It was a
little ridiculous,”
according to
Roessler, because
“there was nobody
here and we didn’t
have a registered
party. Security
had no reason to be
in the house...there
was no cause for
them to be here.”
Roessler said that five men were
sitting in the room and “just hang-
ing out with some music playing in
the background, but it was not even
loud. Two security guards came in
the room and said they were just
‘doing a routine check’...they said
“you guys got to keep it quict’.”

According to Kurt Mull °92,
a member of Kappa Sigma, Secur-
ity conducted spot checks when no
brothers knew that they were in the
house. Mull reported that on a
recent Friday night at 1:30 a.m.,
two security guards walked into a
room and they said “...we found 10
kegs in your walk-in and we need
to see an officer now.” Mull said
that they had entered the house
through the back door and headed
straight for their walk-in refrigera-
tor, located in the basement. “The
guys were not drinking and there
was not a party going on...the base-
ment was completely dark and
there was no loud music...the offi-
cers said they were just doing a
routine check.”

Greek leaders have com-
plained of the delays and discrepan-
cies between Security’s so-called

“extra precautions’ and the adminis-
tration’s policy. According to Pete

Epsilon, “Security does things, and

Sigma Chi President Eric
Belcher ’91 reported that his house
did not receive the report of alleged
violations from last May unti! the
first week of September. In a letter
addressed to President Sojka,
Belcher said “for the first time, I
have seen no security report outlin-
ing the details of the alleged viola-
tion.” Belcher explained “Dean
Dunlop gave us the ‘choice’ of tak-
ing an automatic three weeks of
social probation or scheduling a
hearing with the IFC Peer Review
Board to decide the matter. Dean
Dunlop informed me that if we
opted to have our case heard, and
we were found guilty, that we
would be facing a more severe pen-
alty. As the alleged violation
occurred in May, it was impossible
for me to find anyone who remem-
bered the events of the evening.
Twenty-four members of our frater-
nity have since graduated, and I
was not prepared to track them all
down in order to see if they might
be of some assistance in the mat-
ter...our Fraternity was forced to
opt for the Dean’s ‘compromise’.”

Dean Dunlop explained that there
were seven groups who received
alleged citations resulting from
House Party Weekend, on May 5,
and that “everybody knew that
alleged infractions had been
reported and were being investi-
gated. The IFC Review board was
up to its navel in cases...groups
were just lined up taking their
turns...they

couldn’t have pos-
sibly gotten to
these matters until
next fall anyway.”
Dunlop added “To
six of the seven
groups it was
clear because they
did not complain.”

“If they had
gone before the
Peer Review
Board,” Dunlop
said, “they would
have gotten the
full particulars of
the case of materi-
als.” Dunlop
explained his
‘compromise’ as a
“bargain  deal...If
the IFC had deter-
mined the sanc-
tion, their previ-
ous record would
have been taken
into account and
every one of those
groups would
have gotten more
than I gave them.
I kind of cut them
a break due to the
delay and what-
ever. I don’t know
precise

amount of Sigma

Chi’s _ violations
but they would have gotten more
weeks of social probation had they
been found guilty...and Eric knows
that because he’s kept track of how
many offenses Sigma Chi had.”

Dunlop explained “I
remiss in not putting this in writing
as ‘unfinished business.’ The rea-
son I didn’t feel much urgency to
do that is because Dadez
announced at the IFC meeting that
we had unfinished business from
House Party Weekend. Some
groups had been written up,
charges were pending, and they
would be dealt with in the fail. And
his recollection is that he told the
groups who they were.”

Belcher also voiced concern
about an alleged violation during
the Freshman Orientation period
which the administration followed
up with an automatic probation
without tial. Sigma Chi, along
with seven other fraternities,
received letters from Jacobsen
warming them against “Any further
violations...” Jacobsen explained
that the letters were not a “you
have been found guilty” charge but
they were an “interim suspension

Enforcement of alcohol sanctions
found to be tougher on Greeks

“Students have been telling
me ... that there is a difference
between the way Residential Life
investigates [alcohol violations]
and Security does,” said John P.
Dunlop, dean of students, in an
interview this week. According
to Mike Amarante, interim direc-
tor of security and safety, Secur-
ity was given the responsibility
for monitoring fraternities at a
meeting “of the Deans and Tim
Murrell.” Because residential life
has retained monitoring responsi-
bilities in residence halls, frater-
nities are treated differently than
students living in residence halls
when it comes to alcohol viola-
tions. Recent incidents seem to
reveal a pattem of uneven
enforcement of the University
Alcohol Policy.

According to Kevin
O’Brien, vice-president of Chi
Phi fraternity, on Sept. 8, one Chi
Phi brother and two other stu-
dents were caught with cups of
beer in the fraternity house. After
a search of the common areas of
the house, a tapped keg was
found in the house’s refrigerator.
According to O’Brien there were
few other brothers in the house,
but the house was subsequently
charged with a group violation of
the Alcohol Policy.

On Aug. 28, according to
Dunlop, eleven underage stu-
dents were caught drinking by
Gerard Turbide, downhill area
coordinator, in Carey House,

saying until this is adjudicated
don’t do things that are likely to
exacerbate’’ existing problems.
According to Jacobsen, the
“interim suspension’ is a pending
adjudication” and there are “differ-
ent strategies” behind the sanctions
and the suspensions.

Dunlop further explained the
‘interim suspension’ as “a putting
things on hold so you don’t make
matters worse. It looked like they
had done something wrong...it was
a warning saying don’t complicate
things by business as usual or
something. It looks like a punish-
ment because they’ve stopped dead
in their tracks but it’s a protective
‘stop dead in your tracks’ rather
than a sanction or punishment.”

Kappa Sigma, another one of
the seven houses to receive an
“interim suspension” letter from
Jacobsen, waited two wecks until
their case was adjudicated and
received an explicit warning for the
“thirty-five to forty freshmen
present” when Associate Dean

which is part of the Social Justice
College. Several others left when
they saw Turbide. Upon further
investigation a tapped keg was
found in the bathroom, Charges are
pending against the individuals
who were caught, but no group
charges against either Carey House
or the Social Justice College are
pending, according to Dunlop.

Dunlop explained that the
reason for filing individual charges
as opposed to group charges was
that “the residential life staff mem-
bers that investigated that did not
report anything that suggested that
the event was at the initiation of or
under the sponsorship of the Social
Justice College. Furthermore, it
was the first night of orientation, all
of the students were freshmen, and
not all of the students cited came
from Carey house or the Social Jus-
tice College.”

According to Dunlop, Tur-
bide investigated the situation thor-
oughly before coming to this con-
clusion. Dunlop explained that the
determination of group or individ-
ual charges in the case of tapped
kegs is based on “how many people
were involved, who purchased the
keg, and where it was.”

Many Greeks would argue
that if the same situation that devel-
oped in Carey House, i.e. a tapped
keg in a common area, had hap-
pened in a fraternity, that the house
would face group charges. The dif-
ference, however, was that Resi-
dential Life made an effort to ascer-
tain whether or not it was a group
violation.

“Those groups and/or organi-
zations who hold — functions/
activities on University owned or

Mary Dorsey entered their house
According to Greg Geissenberger
92, a brother of Kappa Sigma,
“Mary Dorsey saw a bunch of
freshmen go by SAE, go by
Sammy, and then walk into Kappa
Sig. Then she came in the house
and needed to talk to an officer
because we had allowed freshmen
into the house before we were
allowed.” Geissenberger said that
the brothers did not know if they
were freshmen and there was not a
brother standing at the door “check-
ing everyone’s i.d. to find out if
they were.”

“Although Freshmen were
more than 50% of the problem,”
Dorsey said, “It is the responsibility
of the fraternity to ensure freshmen
are not in the houses...it’s a tough
problem.” Dorsey explained that on
the first night that two houses were
allegedly charged with having
freshmen, she went around and
“asked for an officer” at each of the
fraternities. Dorsey said “I

controlled property, with alcohol
involved, are required to follow
the guidelines and policies set
forth by the Bucknell University
Act 31 Task Force [University
Alcohol Policy Relating to Stu-
dents and Students Organiza-
tions, Revised 6/90],” according
to a pamphlet sent recently to all
members of the Bucknell com-
munity from President Gary
Sojka. The University Alcohol
Policy states that for fraternities,
“alcoholic beverages cannot be
present in public areas of chapter
houses except at approved, regis-
tered events and in approved
quantities.” The policy for resi-
dence halls is similar, saying that
“alcoholic beverages may not be
present in Common areas of resi-
dence halls, except during regis-
tered events approved by the
Office of Residential Life.”

In each of the incidents, all
students were individually cited
for underage drinking while in
the Chi Phi incident, the frater-
nity was additionally charged
with holding an unregistered
party and related offenses.

Student concern centers
around the fact that when frater-
nities are found with tapped kegs
in common areas they are auto-
matically charged with group vio-
lations even if there is just one
brother involved. Although he
denied this as a prima facie prac-
tice, he did note, “I don’t recall a
case in which a keg was found in
a house in a common area that
charges were not filed against the
house.”

(Next week the oversight of
Security will be investigated.)

reminded them of the policy they
had received earlier that week..”

In response to Kappa
Sigma’s difficulty in identifying
freshmen, Dorsey said “I would
assume that if you saw a group of
thirty to forty people, you would
ask them who they were and what
they were doing.“ Dorsey
explained that while driving by in
her car, “I watched the same group
walking down Seventh Street and
stopping at a couple of places” but
the only house they entered was
Kappa Sigma. Dorsey said “By the
time I went around the block and
parked my car, they still had not
come out.” Dorsey explained “the
freshmen have a responsibility too
but that it is difficult, by myself, to
get the names and i.d.’s of a group
of thirty people.” According to
Dorsey there has been a least one
freshmen who came out of a frater-
nity charged with underage
drinking.

New Jersey to Pennsylvania dispo-
sal sites near the highway. Garrett
noted that the township “has paid
its dues with negative develop-
ments” such as the Allenwood Fed
eral Prison Camp and the Lycom-
ing County Landfill, and said the
incinerator project may adversely
affect a proposal to expand the
prison. Garrett is concerned about
the general health risks of the pro-
ject, as well as the specific danger
that a derailment may cause a haz
ardous waste spill into the Susque
hanna River. Garrett said that the
incinerator could affect the Univer
sity because Lewisburg

and because the danger that other
businesses, such as chemical and
pharmaceutical companies, may be
attracted to the areca,
endangering “the pristine nature of
the county.”

Union County State
Russ Fairchild has also

record against the project, question-
ing the ability of the state Depart-
ment of Environmental Resources
to monitor safety at the site, saying
that, “The question is how good is
DER at actually monitoring a facil-
ity on a daily basis? Fiscally I
frankly don’t see any more money
coming to enhance monitoring
capabilities for any government
agency.” Fairchild has also ques-
tioned the location of the incinera-
tor in rural Union County, since
over 80 percent of Pennsylvania’s
hazardous waste is generated in
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.

Professor advocates incineration

Michael LaGrega, professor
of civil engineering, is a former
director of hazardous waste plan-
ning for the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania

LaGrega, who was responsi-
ble for overseeing the implementa-
tion of Pennsylvania’s 1986 plan
for thermal disposal, is an expert on
hazardous waste disposal and an

The Bucknellian

advocate for incineration. He feels
“state-of-the art incinerators are
safe. The risks are much lower”
than with other disposal methods,
such as storage or burial, “but
that’s not to say they are risk-free.”
LaGrega feels that “there is clearly
a need for these types of disposal,
{since] there is no alternative for
organic [hazardous] waste.” The
two main dangers for harmful emis-
sions from incineration, according
to LaGrega, lie in changes in the
feedstream into the buraer, and in
poor operation of the facility.
While there is a danger that toxic
materials such as cadmium, nickel,
mercury and dioxins may be
released in air emissions, LaGrega
explained that most harmful emis-
sions are released if waste is burned
at an improper temperature, but that
modem incinerators “have very
elaborate control systems [and] the
feedstream shuts off if the tempera-
ture drops” below an acceptable
level. He also noted that “there are
rather stringent air toxin regula-

tions” regarding emissions.
Whether an incinerator only
accepts the types of wastes for
which it is designed, LaGrega said,
“is a function of how good the
management plan is, and how good
the company is, [since] the only
way you can get assurances is if the
management at the top will see you
get proper controls.” He explained
that USPCI is “not a new com-
pany” and “has a reputation for
being responsible” at similar facili-
ties the company operates. LaGrega
noted that with a large, established
company such as Union Pacific,
there is little danger the company
will go bankrupt and disappear,
leaving an abandoned, contami-
nated site.

Campus opinion split on issue
Unlike LaGrega, some stu-
dents and faculty members oppose
construction of the Gregg Town-
ship incinerator. Bucknell’s Earth
Action group will be attempting to
recruit members for OUE on cam-

pus in the coming weeks. Accord-
ing to Matt Cohn ’93, one of the
organizers of the effort, Earth
Action will be setting up tables in
the Langone Center mall to solicit
members of the campus community
to join OUE and to sign petitions
against the construction of the
incinerator.

Ben Marsh, chair and asso-
ciate professor of geography, con-
cedes that “[{hazardous waste]
exists, and you have to put it some-
where, and incineration, in some
ways is greatly preferable” to other
methods of disposal. However,
Marsh questioned the safety of
incineration in a number of areas,
chiefly “serious health concerns,
which are not the same as serious
health problems.” The difficulty, he
said, is that the relatively low levels
of toxins involved make the long-
term effects hard to measure, and
“since the data is unclear, people
can interpret it either way.” Marsh
also noted that while new incinera-
tors incorporate _ state-of-the-art

technology designed to maximize
safety, “to say that the design of the
plant is adequate is not the same as
saying that the implementation will
be adequate, or perfect....The
design can be adequate and the
operation isn’t, [since] the exis-
tence of technology isn’t the same
as trusting” the operators. Marsh
pointed to the Peach Bottom
nuclear plant in southern Pennsyl-
vania, in which control room opera-
tors were found to be sleeping on
the job, as an example of the dan-
gers inherent despite the presence
of safety systems.

Marsh also addressed the
“equity issue” involved, since “[an
incinerator] ends up somewhere, in
somebody’s neighborhood.” Marsh
believes the decision was made to
locate the project in Union County
because “central Pennsylvania has
such agreeable people, who tend
not to be political or activist. They
tend to trust the government and
corporations.”

Dinner held for committee of a thousand

Robert Rooke ‘13 was present this Saturday for a dinner that was held for the major contributors to the
Campaign for Bucknell. Rooke, who has a tradition of giving to the University, dedicated Rooke Chapel
to his parents in 1964. Bucknell raised over $90 million from 1983 to 1990 through the Campaign. The
money is being used for, among other things, physical improvements to the campus, such as the new Sci-

ence Complex.

CUT "

By Andrew Cohen and

Staff Writers

September 21-23 was desig-
nated as the “Weekend of a Thou-
sand.” Those people who have-
made major contributions to the
Campaign for Bucknell, which
took place from 1983 to 1990,
were on hand to celebrate the most
successful fundraising drive in the
history of the University.

The theme for the weekend
was “Ninety in Ninety.” The week-
end was in celebration of the $90.9
million that was raised during the
Campaign for Bucknell.

The dinner was attended by
several members of the Board of
Trustees, among them, Chairman
Lee Idleman who spoke to the
guests and stressed the importance
of fundraising to function of the
university. Robert L. Rooke ‘13,
secretary emiritus of the Baord of
Trustees, was also in attendance.

Alumni ranging the spectrum
of age were there to show their
support for the University.

Bucknell enters the new dec-
ade in a much firmer financial posi-
tion, allowing for, among other
things, new facilities, scholarships.
and faculty chairs.

stance of Eisenstein’s resolution
within the context of the motion to
rescind.)

“I feel the BSG should not
take any stance on chalk-talk until
we have a better understanding of
federal and municipal laws on this
issue,” Selmeski stated to the con-
gress. “We are acting without a
great deal of foresight.”

This appeal to first amend-
ment concerns was challenged by
John Dunlop, dean of students, who
stated that he believed that the Uni-
versity’s private status meant that it
had the right to limit the form of
expression if it saw fit.

“This clearly is a property
issue,” Dunlop said clarifying com-
ments he made to The Bucknellian
last week. “The University owns
the sidewalks and to write on them
is a privilege given to you, not by
the Constitution, but by us.”

Eisenstein, in defending the
resolution he authored, supported
Dunlop’s reading of the issue as
one of property rights and not first
amendment rights. By attempting

to ban chalk-talk, Eisenstein said
that he was not trying to limit
speech, but to protect the appear-
ance of the campus which which
the community shares.

“If this motion to rescind
passes we lose control of our prop-
erty,” Eisenstein stated. “This
chalking is detracting from the
campus; one of the reasons I came
to this campus is because it was
one of the nicest in the Northeast.”

Selmeski addressed the issue
of property rights, stating that “by
rescinding this resolution we are
actually retaining control of our
property.” Such a resolution, he
went on to argue, set a precedent
for limiting student expression and
predetermining how students may
interact with their campus
environment.

Alternate representative Jeff
Mastracchio ‘91, warned the con-
gress that it should not let the con-
cern for aesthetics override the
importance of conveying ideas and
information. He also questioned
whether or not people were voting
on the form of expression, as Eisen-

Th Bucknellian

Stein’s resolution states, or on its
content.

Chalk-talk has become an
increasingly popular method for
Organizations to present their politi-
cal messages or advertise campus
events which they sponsor. While
the practice was originally begun
by the service fraternity Alpha Phi
Omega, the organization whose
writing has drawn the most atten-
tion has been the Partnership of
Women Engaged in Revolution
(P.O.W.E.R.) which uses the chalk
writing to address gender issues
and the status of relations between
the sexes.

Arguing for the rescission of
the resolution to ban chalk-talk,
representative Tony Graves ‘93
drew an analogy between construc-
tion projects on campus and the
chalking of the sidewalk by groups
such as P.O.W.E.R. Though some
might find the actual construction
of these new buildings unsightly,
he said, everyone is pleased with
and convinced of the value of the
completed structure.

The chalking which some

consider to be aesthetically offen-
sive can be approached in the same
manner. What chalk-talk is doing,
Graves said, “is building your mind.
You want new ideas, this is the way
to get them.”

P.O.W.E.R. has consistently employed chalk writing in making students aware of

its message.

Eisenstein’s point that ban-
ning chalk-talk would not have the
effect of limiting speech due to the
availability of other mediums of
communication was supported by
Carl Zeckerberg ‘91, a class repre-

sentative, who suggested that fliers,
posters, and newspaper articles can
all serve as effective forms of
expression.

Those organizations which do
use chalk as a means of communi-
cation “should choose
a form = which is
socially acceptable,”
Zeckerberg said. “Is
there really a majority
of people who like this
chalking?”

The motion to
rescind, though, did
pass by a clear margin.
Eisenstein had_ stated
in an interview on
Sept. 19 that if his res-
olution was overturned
that he would move to
hold a student referen-
dum on the issue. After
the vote in favor of res-
cission Eisenstein
attempted to make a
motion, but was unable
to before the congress
voted to adjourn itself.

Eisenstein
declined to comment
on the congress’ proceedings con-
cerning chalk-talk at the conclusion
of the meeting

Skena stated that he “was
content that the BSG acted respon-
sibly on this very important issue,
“and that he would formally with-
draw Eisenstein’s resolution from
administrative consideration.”

The motion to charge the Stu-
dent Affairs committee with exam-
ining whether it would be beneficial
to establish a code by which side-
walk chalking can proceed at Buck-
nell, Skena considered to be a
“good idea.” Selmeski, while he did
express concern that the BSG was
considering sanctioning something
which he had been trying to unfet-
ter, was not opposed to Student
Affairs exploring policy options
concerning chalk-talk.

After this issue has been con-
sidered by the Student Affairs com-
mittee, chaired by Sandi Green ‘93,
it will return its recommendations
to the congress where they may be
approved, rejected, or amended.

A look behind the doors of
Cooley Hall now and then

By Lisa Lipari

Did you ever wonder where
all that mail from Bucknell comes
from? Who writes all those letters?
Who stuffs the envelopes? Well,
the answers lie in Cooley Hall.

The heart of the University’s
contacts with the outside world,
Cooley Hall is the location of
Bucknell’s Public Relations, Publi-
cations and Development offices. It
is here that detailed files are kept
on all alumni since the first gradu-
ating class, and where the planning
for most major events at Bucknell
occurs. The University Relations
office handles everything from
organizing reunions and theme
weekends for alumni to sending out
mailings for prospectives. Accord-
ing to Marsha Scott Gori, Editor of
Bucknell World, the main objec-
tive of the University Relations
office is “keeping track of people,”

which is why a professional clip-
ping service is used to find out any
noteworthy information about
Bucknell graduates. The articles are
saved and kept with the person’s
records at Cooley Hall. Letters of
congratulations are sent out for
weddings, birth announcements,
promotions, and special occasions
in the lives of Bucknellians.

The Development Depart-
ment also includes the Annual and
Deferred Giving offices, which
deal mainly with fund raising.
Large sums of money are given to
Bucknell by alumni, parents and
friends and the Giving offices are
instrumental in maintaining corre-
spondence with these benefactors.
Special days, such as Scholarship
Day, are organized so that these
benefactors can see exactly what
their gifts have done for the Buck-
nell students who have received
them.

The publications _ office,
located on the second floor of
Cooley Hall, is primarily involved
in media and public relations.
Bucknell World, whose readership
includes alumni, parents, faculty,
administration, staff, seniors,
friends, corporations and founda-
tions, and others, contains informa-
tion about Bucknellians and “Class
Notes,” a section which contains
stories, anecdotes, and tidbits writ-
ten by former  Bucknellians.
According to Gori, “We’re one of
the last places you can get pub-
lished” because Bucknell World
publishes many articles submitted
by alumni. Gori said that while the
department has greatly expanded,
they have done so conservatively
and have been able to maintain a
steady level of production.

“The amount of work that
comes out [of this office] is unbe-
lievable. We have a large support
staff who are the foot soldiers...it
has always been a tradition to have
professional and support staffs
working together,” said Gori.

But Cooley Hall was not
always the center for Bucknell’s
outside correspondence. Built circa
1880 and later named for Robert L.
Cooley 36, trustee and Alumni

Dear

Dear Wanda,

It’s only the third week of
classes and already I’m stressed
out! At this rate I'll never make
it through the semester. Do you
have any suggestions?

Dear Stressed,

Don’t worry. We all feel this
way sometimes. Stress can work to
your advantage if you know how to
handle it the right way. Emotion-
ally, stress leads to moodiness,
sleeplessness, and lack of concen-
tration. Physically, stress leads to
upset stomach, headaches, skin
rashes, and insomnia. Here are
some helpful tips:

EAT WELL: ice. fruits, vege-
tables, and fiber. Avoid that candy
bar; fatigue will follow the original
sugar high.

SLEEP: don’t skimp on your
zzzzz’s and make sure you avoid
those stressful thoughts before
bedtime.

EXERCISE: take a walk, do
aerobics, lift weights, swim...
Bucknell has an amazing variety of
exercise options.

TALK ABOUT YOUR
FEELINGS: talk to your friends or
give Psych Services a call. They
are located in Lowry House and are
always eager to help. The phone
number there is 523-1604. Many
students use this resource so there’s
no need to feel any embarrassment.

Most of all, give yourself a
break! Don’t set goals that are too
difficult—most pressure comes
from within.

Dear Wanda,

My roomate brought some-
one home last weekend and they
hooked up while I was in the
room. I pretended to be asleep
because I was embarrassed.
What should I do if it happens
again?

Representative, the hall was origi-
nally used by Bucknell as a frater-
nity house for Theta Upsilon
Omega (1928-1938), which was
later called Sigma Phi Epsilon. The
fraternity was disbanded after
WWII and the house was given
back to its previous owner until the
University purchased it in 1943.
After that it was used as a men’s
dining hall, the University Cafete-
ria, boarding facilities for upper-
classmen, as office space for the
Central Susquehanna Intermediate
Unit, and, finally, as the headquar-
ters for University and Public
Relations.

Because it is located away
from the center of campus (on the
comer of Malcolm street and Uni-
versily avenue), some who work at
Cooley feel that they are isolated.
Gori said that they sometimes feel
like a separate entity, but that they
all stick together. “It’s better that
we’re here...we’re easy to find...and
alumni come here to the ‘external
relations triangle.’ That is, the
Alumni House, the President’s
House and Cooley Hall.” She
added, “Even though we’re located
off campus we feel like we're a
part of everybody.”

anda

Dear Unwilling Voyeur,

If you have a good relation-
ship with your roommate, a polite
request from you should solve the
problem before it can happpen
again. Simply tell your roomy that
you are delighted they are having a
good time, but you are a light
sleeper. Suggest that you would be
happy to stay in a friend’s room if
you were forewarned. Make sure
you do not sound accusing or hos-
tile; starting with “I felt embar-
rassed” or something similar will
keep your roomy off the defensive.

If you do not have a good
rapport with your roommate, ruin-
ing the mood might do the trick.
Next time he or she attempts to
sneak in with a hook-up, “wake up”
loudly; explain you want a drink of
water and say, “do not let me dis-
turb you” on your way out. Try not
to sound TOO hostile or sarcastic;
they may decide to stick around
just to spite you. If the “friend” is
still there upon your return (give
them a few minutes to say good-
bye), tell them you are going to
read for a while and explain that
they should just pretend you are not
there. If this does not affect the
happy couple, suggest that since
they are not overly concerned with
privacy, perhaps the hall lounge
would be more appropriate. Trade-
offs can work as well—for exam-
ple, promising not to tell anyone
about her padded bras if she prom-
ises not to hook-up in your
presence.

Send your problems to:
Dear Wanda, c/o The Bucknel-
lian, Box C-3059.

Cooley Hall, now home to the university’s public relations, publica-
tion, and development offices, once housed a fraternity and a men’s
dining hall.

Let’s Do Lunch

Bucknell Golf Club
Smoketown Rd.
Hours: Starting Oct. 1
Closed Mondays
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday

With Steve Hoerter and Julie Bachman
Staff Writers

One of the best kept secrets in town has to be the new dining
facility at the Bucknell Golf Club. It’s not a “members only” situa-
tion...so if you are a student, faculty member, or Lewisburg resident
you are automatically eligible to wine, dine, and (whatever else you
want to do) in this stylish establishment surrounded by the breath-
taking rolling links of the B.G.C

Last year a significant number of dollars were allocated to the
refurbishment of the old country club building. A dining room and
snack bar were part of the plan...and it tumed out very nicely.
Numerous tables have pleasant scenic views of the out-of-doors, or,
if you are in a sporting mood, you can catch the “game” on the tele-
vision. (It would be an ideal place to catch the Bears’ game on a
Sunday afternoon.)

Steve and Julie were in a state of flux, so they watched the
tube and, for a bit of entertainment, watched some “golfers” go 8
over par on the 10th hole.

Julie decided to sample the chicken salad platter ($2.75) and
an order of french fries ($1.00). Neither was particularly spectacu-
lar, but the presentation was impressive. The chicken salad was
served on a bed of lettuce and cabbage with carrots, celery and
tomatoes. Carr’s Table Water Crackers also accompanied the meal.
The chicken salad may have been a bit more tasty...there really was
no unique taste. The french fries were average- again, there was
nothing appreciatively superb about them. (Julie suspects that the
chicken salad may be the same that is served in the cafeteria.)

Steve dined on a turkey club ($2.85) and an order of fries. He
thought the club was excellent and filling. He felt that the fries were
“better than McDonald’s but not better than Wendy’s.” (Steve is
on a health kick and really appreciates Wendy’s use of vegetable oil
instead of beef tallow.)

The prices at the Bucknell Golf Club are irresistably low. The
helpings were very generous and the service was distinguished.

The B.G.C. serves breakfast on the weekends only. Lunch
and dinner are served daily and a large assortment of items are avail-
able...from salads, burgers, and sandwiches to buffalo wings and
soups.

Steve and Julie are in a great mood this time...unlike last week
we did not require the use of antacids to get through the day. Ona
scale of one to five bison (one being the lowest and most humiliat-
ing number possible) we rate the Bucknell Golf Club three bison.

Stay tuned for the long-awaited “Wine, Dine, and Well...Never
Mind” coming next week in this very section.

Bison Tales |A Chat with the mayor

Henaricks talks about Bucknell, his job, and his interests

By Peter Lalos
and Marc Haimes

The other day I was head-
ing to an afternoon lecture, just
watching the campus construc-
tion workers race each other to
the Porta-John, and, you know,
there’s something about psychol-
ogy class that really scares me.

.. Hold it. Let’s get this
cafeteria business out of the way
first. Somebody cue me.

WHAM! SPLATTO!

So before I knew what
happened, I’m sporting this
joker’s chicken fajita on my
shirt. He mumbles something
like, “I hope they let me get a
second entree anyway,” and
walks back to the serving line.
Meanwhile, the entire caf has
erupted into joyous applause—
it’s a form of relieving stress for
them, I know, but I need it like a
third nostril. Well, at least I
found my friends— they’re the
ones holding up the scorecards.
9.7, 8.6, 9.2, 10.0, 9.8... I’ve had
better wipeouts.

I sit down with them, and
immediately everyone _ starts
busting on what I’m eating.
Have you ever sat down at a
table where everyone actually
liked what you were eating? I
just can’t see this scene: “Man,
that looks absolutely scrump-
tious... Hey fellas, look at this
spread! Damn, gimme some of
that!!!” It?s not meant to happen.

But I digress. Anyway, my
entree-splattered shirt is begin-
ning to look like a Van Gogh
painting by now, and my tum-
coat buddies are still blistering
me for my decision to go with
the raw carrot lasagna. I was
pretty fed up with the whole
affair, so I got up to cool off my
nerves at the soda dispenser. Bad
call. The Cherry Coke machine
had a familiar sign on it: Sorry.
Out of order. I couldn’t help but
thinking that this situation would
make for an intriguing psychol-
ogy dissertation... Are they hon-
estly feeling remorse since
they’ve run out of this drink, or
is it more a sense of embarrassed
inadequacy? Let’s get down to
brass tacks, here.

Like a dingbat, then, I
tried the Sprite dispenser (it was
the only one without a yellow
card). It spat out a clear froth of
carbonated water, along with a
sound reminiscent of a cat spew-
ing up one mother of a hairball.
Why is it that an inexplicable
sense of shame comes over you
when this happens? Why don’t
they simply stamp “Rejected!”
on my forehead while they’re at
it? At once I noticed that people
were starting to gather and mur-
mur amongst themselves. These
soda machines always make me
feel so neurotic.

Back outside, I found my
friends scoping like madmen
while they ate. A time honored
tradition; nothing new here. As I
watched them work out, though,
the practicality of this situation
bothered me. After all, how hot
can people look while they’re
snarfing down a_ stromboli?
Besides, it’s been clinically
proven that 63% of all caf acci-
dents occur due to excessive
scoping. Perhaps if that dingle-
berry at the salad bar hadn’t
been on the lookout for a one-
nighter... Ah, but this is mere
conjecture.

It was at this point that I
noticed something going on with

my buddies that is common to
all hard-core scammers— and
that is, the longer a person
scams, the harder he chews
what’s in his mouth. In fact,
after awhile they begin to down-
right grind it to death. It’s for
this reason that I recommend the
cafeteria’s roast beef to these
people. Fascinating, this classic
inner struggle of the scoper:

ID: Man, is dis caf scope heaven
‘er what?

EGO: Hold thy tongue, knave.
Verily, this is a hall of
nourishment, and_ little
else.

ID: Hey, some people might
even argue wid’ dat...
Whoa, senorita! Make my
night!

EGO: Forsooth, thou art an
embarrassment to thine
gender. Abstain, sayeth I,
Abstain!

ID: Aw, gimme some slack, you
quiche. ‘An loosen up yer
chassis belt, while yer at
it!

EGO: That would be “chastity
belt.”

ID: Whatever. Man, dig them
carouselambras!!!

EGO: Yeesh.

I suddenly snapped out of
my reverie as I noticed that the
other guys were stuffing a magi-
cal pot pourri of raw egg, oat-
meal and chicken burgers into
one of my glasses. I’m not cer-
tain why people do this—
maybe it has something to do
with an unresolved Oedipal
complex. At the very least, it
usually signals the end of the
meal. One of the guys stood up,
and the rest of us hastily fol-
lowed suit (Apparently, it’s one
of man’s greatest fears to be left
behind at a cafeteria table). This
is what’s known as the clash
between autonomy and _ self-
doubt.

Over at the tray line, we
got yelled at because we didn’t
take the paper products off of
our plates. Anyway, it was at
this juncture that I faced a famil-
iar problem. I think we all know
what I’m referring to: The
dilemma of tying to retain
some modicum of dignity and
poise while the caf workers look
at what atrocities you’ve com-
mitted on your tray. Somehow
when you receive the worker’s
pained expression, the aesthetic
value of your pudding sculture
of “The Thinker” doesn’t seern
so appealing anymore. Pulling
our collars up around our faces,
the five of us beat a hasty retreat
out of the cafeteria, taking two
steps at a time down the
stairwell.

... Well, there you have it.
Now, as I trudge off to psychol-
ogy class with about 17 books
under one arm (I’m not secure
enough in my masculinity to use
two hands), I thrust my free
hand into my empty right
pocket. I find myself reflecting
on my irrational fear of meal
cards, and shudder. The insensi-
tivity of it all—the sum of
human worth reduced to nothing
more than a thin piece of coded
plastic... speaking of which,
where the hell is my ID?

By Sean Grass
Staff Writer

Lewis Hendricks, Jr. That’s
a name that all Bucknell students
should know, though probably less
than ten people on campus have
any idea who he is. Even so, Lewis
Hendricks, Jr. is very much aware
of the students of Bucknell Univer-
sity. Part of his job is ensuring the
safety and well-being of all of us
here at Bucknell. At the same time
he must satisfy the citizens of the
community surrounding the cam-
pus. Striking that sometimes pre-
carious balance is what the mayor
of Lewisburg must do, and Lewis
Hendricks, Jr. always strives for
that compromise.

“I’m elected by the people of
Lewisburg, and I still want to pro-
tect the safety of Bucknell students
here. So I’m an in-between guy,”
he tells me from the comfort of a
recliner in his living room. “I try to
work for everybody. That’s my
job.”

So the mayor must straddle
the tense line that is the relationship
between the Bucknell students and
the Lewisburg residents. The ten-
sion between students and residents
is essentially never-ending, as the
mayor admits. Hendricks says the
problem has always been particu-
larly acute in the 6th St., 7th St,
and 8th St. areas, where the greatest
concentration of student apartments
is located. Complaints of noise, dis-
orderly conduct, and the like are
common in these areas.

A smile draws across his face
and he says, “The kids can have as
many parties as they want, so long
as it is under control.” The mayor
realizes that partics and some wild
behavior are to be expected, and as
long as there are no complaints
from neighbors and no public dis-
plays of drunkenness or rowdy
behavior, there is
normally no
problem. Simple
respect for the
tules and regula-
tions of Lewis-
burg is the key.
Says Hendricks,
“You're going to live by the bor-
ough ordinances, and that’s the way
it’s going to be.”

According to the mayor, the
relationship between the town and
the university has indeed improved
in recent years. Several years ago
the students of Bucknell were, as
Hendricks puts it, “a real pain in
the neck.” Although the students
spent a great deal of money in the
shops of Lewisburg, that benefit
was outweighed by the trouble they
would cause roaming the city
streets. Now that story is changing.
The mayor says that the addition of
the Weis Center, as well as various
university-sponsored programs, has
provided an attraction for students
to spend their time on campus. This
is one explanation for the improve-
ment in relations.

Other factors have also
played a vital role. For instance,
residents of 6th St. hold neighbor-
hood gatherings so that the students
living there can acquaint them-
selves with their neighbors. Also,

| There is a difference in Law Schools

borough officials have begun to
meet with representatives of the
Bucknell Student Government to
provide an opportunity for an airing
out of problems in the university-
borough relationship and to discuss
possible solutions.

But the key to the improve-
ment in relations has been the great
rapport between Lewisburg offi-
cials and Bucknell’s administration.

between Bucknell’s administration
and the borough government “is at
a ten.”

The mayor does admit to
some concerns about the effects of
the university’s new and more
stringent alcohol policy for this
year. He believes that the new pol-
icy “probably will” make things
worse as parties are moved off
campus and into Lewisburg as a

Lewis Hendricks relaxes in his living room as he talks about life since
his recent retirement, allowing him to concentrate more on his mayo-

ral duties.

Each quarter, Hendricks tells me,
he and other borough officials meet
with President Gary Sojka and a
team of university administrators in
what they call a “get-together.” The
groups discuss problems, policy
changes, and policy alternatives.

“I’m elected by the people of Lewisburg,
and | still want to protect the safety
of Bucknell students here.”

Each side tries to keep the other
informed about the problems that
face it. Staying abreast of the prob-
lems is crucial.

Overall, Hendricks _ says,
“The town and the university
administration do have a good
working relationship.” He empha-
sizes that this is particularly true
since Gary Sojka took over as pres-
ident of the university. With Sojka,
Hendricks says, there has been “a
big difference —
an improvement
in working rela-
tions.” He also
lauds outgoing
Director of
Security and
Safety Timothy Murrell as an
excellent man to work with, and he
has a note of sincerity in his voice
when he says that Murrell will be
missed. Of course, Hendricks has
no qualms about saying that the
whole administration has been very
good to work with. Right now,
Hendricks says that the relationship

result of the tougher alcohol regula-
tions. Borough police may just
have to crack down harder. Hen-
dricks says, “In the past, we used to
give wamings” to some offenders,
but that this year there will be “no
more warnings. The police hate to
be babysitters.”
Yet he is quick to
add that the bor-
ough will do
whatever is nec-
essary to main-
tain good living
conditions in
Lewisburg. Incidents of public
drunkenness and improper behav-
ior—such as an incident three
weeks ago in which a Bucknell stu-
dent was found passed out at 2:30
a.m. on the curb of St. John St—
merely leave “a bad taste not only
for the Bucknell people but for the
community.”

But, generally speaking, Hen-
dricks states, “The borough as a
whole has accepted Bucknell.”

“The kids can have as many parties
as they want, so long as

it is under control.”

That seems to suit him just fine.
Now into his twenty-first year in
Lewisburg politics, including eight
years on borough council (of which
five were spent as council presi-
dent) and twelve years plus as
mayor, Lewis Hendricks, Jr. would
prefer to have as little friction as
possible between residents and stu-

dents. Recently retired, Lewis
(friends call him “Lew” for short)
would like to spend as much time
as possible at home enjoying the
company of his wife and pets. His
four little dogs, all of them differ-
ent breeds, are ...rambunctious, to
say the least. Lew says they’re just
like kids. His parrot, Chico, never
stops talking and squawking, and
he can even whistle the Star-
Spangled Banner when he has a
mind. In addition, a few aquariums
of tropical fish sit in his living
room, one of them serving as the
middle portion of his glass coffee
table. Yes, there is plenty to keep
him occupied at home; even so, he
has his late nights.

His wife Jeanne peeks around
the corner from the kitchen to ask,
“Did he tell you that sometimes he
doesn’t get home ‘til midnight?”
Yes, he did. Lew tells me that his
average work week is about fifteen
hours for his mayoral duties. Only
one or two of those hours is spent
in the office. The rest of the time is
taken up by meetings, groundbreak-
ing ceremonies, and responding to
phone calls from residents with
problems. He says they are prob-
lems that at times border on...

“Ludicrous,” I offer.

He agrees with a smile, but
he insists that to the person with the
problem, the problem is as impor-
tant as if “a tuck came through my
yard and knocked down my front
porch.”

The mayor was bom in
Lewisburg, but moved with his par-
ents to Milton where he attended
school. He moved back to Lewis-
burg with his wife in 1952. Now he
lives with his wife, his dogs, his
parrot, and his fish. The mayor has
a daughter who lives away from
home, but a picture of her sits on
the shelf behind his chair. With so
many things in one house, the
home is transformed into a show-
place. There truly is something
interesting to look at in every cor-
ner as you are serenaded by Chico,
who loves country music. And in
the midst of it all, Mayor Lewis
Hendricks, Jr. sits at ease in his
armchair and shoots the breeze
with me. “I just try to be a friendly
person. I try to work for every-
body.” After a moment he adds, “If
a Bucknell student has a problem
and they need to talk to me, my
phone number is in the book. I
know you don’t vote me in, but
you're still part of the community.”

That seems to be a great asset
to the Bucknell student body, so I
ask him how long he plans on
being mayor, and he says his term
is up in Novem-
ber of 1993. Will
he run again?

“No way!”

laughs, “no
way!”
I
quote you on that?” I kid him.

He says “yes,” but his wife
chimes in “no” from the kitchen.
So I guess it’s hard to say. But
either way, Lewis Hendricks, Jr.
will remain what he is, a man who
just likes people and who wants to
do the best he can for people in
every way.

It ain’t broke; don’t fix it

January at Bucknell is quiet and peaceful. The setting is in fact bucolic. Few
students grace the halls and pathways, while professors work to prepare materi-
als for the coming semester and delve into deeper, research-intensive studies in

their fields.

The Committee on Instruction (COT) wants to change this setting. Citing the
Middle States Accreditation mid-term review as a basis, COI has presented a set
of recommendations to the faculty hoping in earnest that something will change.
They want to see a Bucknell student body that is required to participate in a pro-
gram that was designed to be voluntary and self-enrichment oriented. And they
want to see a faculty that is already overworked and overloaded forced to offer
programs for unmotivated and uninterested students. Who has COI been talking
to? Certainly not the students, and very likely not our faculty.

“Does the January program need to be fixed?,” COI queries. Phone calls and
letters from parents are cited — made out to number in the hundreds. COT tells
us that these letters remind us “that the role of January in the Bucknell education
is not clear to those beyond campus.” Furthermore, they assert, “The expense of
an unproductive January — in student time, in housing fees, and in postpone-
ment of the start of summer — seems not to be justified to parents and students.”

According to whom?

Both students and faculty take advantage of the current January Plan system.
This time is used by students for self-enrichment, both on- and off-campus,
travel and as an opportunity to help finance the exorbinant costs of a Bucknell
education. Untenured and tenured faculty alike use this time for research and to
prepare materials for classes to be held in the Spring.

By what standards is the COI judging whether student time is productive or
not during January and if our January Plan has been justified? When did COI
hold open meetings and forums to solicit student opinion and when was the stu-

dent body notified of these pending recommendations?

Bucknell University exists to fulfill the needs and wants of its student body.
Students clearly enjoy the opportunities and freedoms of the current January plan
— and faculty needs and deserves this time for research and to prepare for spring

classes.

What then is the issue?

BSG member speaks out

To the Editor:

I have heard it many times
before, “What does BSG do any-
way?” Students, too concerned
with books or booze, time and
time again have simply written
off the true value of their student
government. Attempting to avoid
hypocrisy, I must admit that I
also have asked that question at
various times during my stay
here. My main reason has been
that I
believed that
any real lib-
eral changes
that BSG
proposes, to
assist with
the dragging
of the univer-
sity out of
the political stone age in which it
now flounders, would either be
drastically modified or ignored so
that it would fit comfortably
within the moderate to neocon-
servative school policy that the
administration so dutifully
enforces. However, my hypothe-
sis was dependent on the assump-
tion that the Bucknell Student
Government was for liberal
progress, which I now see was
simply a mirage.

On September 16, 1990,

the student government of Bucknell
University almost single-handedly
eliminated any real sign of social
and political progress that this cam-
pus has made in the past few years.
With a 14-10 vote, the Reaganphil-
lic young men and women passed a
resolution to ban “chalk-talk.” You
ask why the big deal? Well, chalk-
talk showed me that there were
some minds on this campus that
were capable of doing more than

just computing the three most

public knowledge....

essential elements of life: GPA,
Cups still remaining in a keg, and
the all-important size of their bank
accounts. It showed that this cam-
pus had a true social conscience,
and was interested in true progress.

So just what made this propo-
sal any more important than any
other BSG has passed? Well, this
proposal fit nicely within that
school policy for which I have now
run out of adjectives and meta-
phors. In other words, if the stu-
dents did not want chalk-talk

because of how disgusting it
makes the campus look (you
know...look at all the major dam-
age it has done), I feel that would
have been the only reason the
administration needed to at least
put limits on this criminal act.
With that problem behind, we all
could have gone on believing
that all is perfect in the bubble.

Well, it was realized how
important this proposal was, so
the next week the student govern-
ment gave
themselves
another
chance to
examine the
issue, and lo
and behold,
the resolution
was over-
turned, once
again removing the lethal
weapon status from a piece of
chalk.

For this issue, a congress
member requested a roll call
vote. That is where everyone
must vote individually, and not
by the normal show of hands.
This is a way of checking on just
what side of the political fence
each person stands. When this
vote is requested, it is supposed

Junior agrees with Mass opinion

To the Editor:

I am not usually one to write
a letter to a newspaper, or even
express my opinions verbally on
campus, but this week I found it
necessary to change this. I am
responding to an Opinion’s article
in last week’s Bucknellian in which
a senior student expressed her
views about the Catholic mass and
community on campus.

I am a member of the Steer-
ing Committee for CCM (Catholic
Campus Ministry), and every Sun-
day for the past two years I have
attended the 4:00 pm mass in
Rooke Chapel. Every Sunday I too
have felt the lack of student partici-
pation and warmth that should be
present during a service geared to
the college community. Something
is different this year and I am glad
that other students besides the
CCM members are noticing. No
longer do I feel apathetic or disap-

pointed when leaving church, but
instead I feel genuinely uplifted
and closer to my fellow Catholic
students. As each Sunday passes,
mass is becoming more crowded
and Bucknellians are smiling and
actually singing together.

For those of you who have
never attended a Catholic mass on
campus, you may not understand
what an astounding difference this
semester is from ones past. For stu-
dents who have tried coming to
mass before, yet haven’t experi-
enced the new service this year, I
encourage you to attend. Granted,
we could not have done it without
the guidance of our new priest
Father Angelo Maraldo, but he
could not have made this difference
by himself. I'd like to believe that
deep down all of us had this spirit
within us, and we were just looking
for a way to let it out. Each week a
few of us returned to church hoping
that it might have changed and it

would give us that feeling of a
community which many of us were
accustomed to at home. Well, now
it has changed and instead of run-
ning out of church as soon as mass
is over, students socialize after-
wards, and that feeling of commu-
nity is continuing to grow.

I'd like to thank everyone for
the positive comments I’ve been
hearing around campus about mass.
It makes us in CCM feel that what
we’ve been doing for the past few
years is worthwhile. I'd also like to
thank everyone for giving me a
chance to feel I am actually part of
a Catholic community on campus
now. Finally, I want to encourage
everyone who was as frustrated
with the 4:00 p.m. mass in the past
as I was to try it again. It makes a
great study break, and hopefully it
will mean something to you too!

Chi Phi boycotts Senior Gift Drive

To the Members of the 1990
Bucknell Senior Gift Drive Com-
mittee, their Administrative Super-
visors, and to Whom It May
Concem:

We, the Class of 1991 of the
Chi Phi Fraternity, wish to inform
the proper persons of our intentions
Not to contribute to the 1990 Senior
Gift Drive.

Our purpose in this decision
is to indicate to the administration
of this institution our sincere dissat-
isfaction with the University’s
inconsistent, underhanded, and
clearly antagonistic policies regard-
ing Greek life. Hence we flatly
refuse to support a tribute, lest it be
misinterpreted as an approval of the
University’s recent actions. Why
should we honor with our support
an institution which has so vehe-

mently sought to destroy the way of
life we enjoy? Fraternity and soror-
ity members comprise approxi-
mately 60% of the Bucknell under-
graduate population; this is an
action to demonstrate the outrage
of that large group. Clearly there
are serious flaws in the Greek sys-
tem at Bucknell; to deny this would
be ludicrous. The administration,
however, has clearly embarked
upon an effort which is aimed,
despite their pacifying assurances,
at the eventual destruction of the
Greek system. While our contribu-
tions would surely not directly help
the administration to pursue our
demise, this is a symbolic gesture
of defiance. Now more than ever
we must speak out in defense of
our treasured brotherhoods and sis-
terhoods. We refuse to fund our
destruction.

We furthermore wholeheart-
edly encourage other organizations
within the Inter-Fraternity system,
and our counterparts in the Panhel-
lenic system, to follow our lead in
protesting Bucknell University’s
persecution of the Greek System.
Our decision should not be consid-
ered a spiteful or vicious attack
upon Bucknell University as a
learning institution, nor upon those
persons who have chosen to work
on or contribute to the Drive. Nei-
ther do we wish to cast doubt on
the Senior Gift Drive itself; the
Drive is a fine tradition, but Greek
seniors should consider the mes-
sage they are sending with their
donation.

Most respectfully yours,

Free speech or vulgarity? A fine line.

By Laura Haden and
Mark Leister

The issue of censorship is one which touches all
American citizens. One current example of controversy
over censorship involved the banning of 2 Live Crew's
albums and concerts. Many of you have probably never
seen any of their lyrics before, yet have supported 2
Live Crew simply under the blanket of “free speech.”
Saturated with the music industry’s continual blurbs on
the ever-persecuted 2 Live Crew, Americans have been
naively convinced that the controversy is unfounded.

However, this summer I was finally allowed to
review some of 2 Live Crew’s “good time” lyrics
through an opinion by George F. Will entitled “Amer-
ica’s Slide into the Sewer” printed in the July 30, 1990
issue of Newsweek. Will’s piece was the first opportu-
nity I found to critique the lyrics and their implications
for myself. Reviewing the actual lyrics certainly altered
my view on music censorship, but even more than that,
his piece also caused me to re-examine that fine line
between freedom of speech and simple vulgarity.
Will’s commentary speaks to issues affecting us at
Bucknell, and I believe our community should be given
an opportunity to sample questionable free speech as
Will sees it:

I regret the offensiveness of what follows. How-
ever, it is high time adult readers sample the words
that millions of young Americans are hearing.

Which words are lyrics, which are testimony?

In a Manhattan courtroom testimony continues in
the trial of young men
accused of gang rape
and other sadistic vio-
lence against the Central
Park jogger in last
April's “wilding”  epi-
sode. “We charged her
and we got her on the
ground. Everybody
started hitting her and
stuff, and she’s on the
ground and everybody's stomping and everything... I
grabbed one arm, and this other kid grabbed one arm
and we grabbed her legs and stuff. And then we took
turns getting on her.” They did it for fun, for
entertainment.

“After she was hit on the head with the pipe, did
someone take her clothes off?”

“Yeah.”

“OK, who took her clothes off?”

“All of us.”

“Did somebody have sex with her?”

“Yeah.”

“Did a lot of people have sex with her?”

“Yeah.”

When arrested a defendant said, “It was some-
thing to do. It was fun.” Where can you get the idea
that sexual violence against women is fun? From a
music store, through Walkman earphones, from boom

boxes blaring forth the rap lyrics of 2 Live Crew:

To have her walkin’ funny we try to abuse it

A big stinking p—y can't do it all

So we try real hard just to bust the walls

That is, bust the walls of women's vaginas. 2
Live Crew's lyrics exult in busting women—almost
always called bitches— in various ways, forcing anal
sex, forcing women to lick feces. “He'll tear the p—y
open ‘cause it's satisfaction.” “Suck my d—, bitch, it
makes you puke.” That's entertainment.

This is medicine. The jogger lost most of her
blood, her temperature plunged to 85. Doctors strug-
gling to keep her alive had to tie down her arms and
legs because, even hours after the attack, while in a
coma that would last weeks, she was flailing and kick-
ing as if “in a fighting stance.” Her face was so disfig-
ured a friend took 15 minutes to identify her. “I recog-
nized her ring.”

Do you recognize the relevance of 2 Live Crew?

I'll break ya down and d—k ya long

Bust your p—y then break your backbone.

The furor (if anything so evanescent can be
called that) about 2 Live Crew has subsided, for two
reason. Saturation journalism, print and broadcast,
around the clock, quickly wrings the novelty out of sub-
jects, leaving them dry husks. Then, if someone raises
the subject again, the answer is a journalistic shrug:
“Not again. We've already done that.” But for 2 Live
Crew the tour rolls on and the money rolls in.

Anyway, the “fury” over the lyrics was feigned.
It had to be because everyone dependent on journalism
did not learn what the offending words were. Media
coverage was characterized by coy abstractness, an
obscuring mist of mincing, supercilious descriptions of
the lyrics as “explicit”
or “outrageous” or
“challenging” or
“controversial” or
“provocative.” Well,
now. Provoking what,
precisely?

From the jogger
trial: “Steve was hold-
ing her with his leg
and someone was rip-
ping off her clothes and pulling her down. She
screamed and Steve held her while Kevin pulled down
his pants and had sex with her. Steve hit her with a
brick twice.”

Fact: Some members of a particular age and
Social cohort—the one making 2 Live Crew rich—
stomped and raped the jobber to the razor edge of
death, for the fun of it. Certainty: the coarsening of a
community, the desensitizing of a society will have
behavioral consequences.

Juan Williams of The Washington Post is black
and disgusted. The issue, he writes, is the abuse of
women, especially black women, and the corruption of
young blacks’ sensibilities, twisting their conceptions
“of good sex, good relationships and good times.”
Half of all black children live in single-parent house-
holds headed by women. The black family is falling
apart, teen pregnancy regularly ruins lives, the rate of

poverty is steadily rising and 2 Live Crew “is selling
corruption—self-hate—to vulnerable young minds in a
weak black America.

No morals: In such selling, liberals are tools of
entertainment corporations. The liberals and the cor-
porations have the morals of the marketplace. Corpo-
rations sell civil pollution for profit; liberals rational-
ize it as virtuous tolerance in “the marketplace of
ideas.” Not to worry, yawn The New York Times edito-
rialists, “The history of music is the story of innova-
tive, even outrageous styles that interacted, adapted
and became mainstream.” Oh, I see: First Stravinsky's
“Rite of Spring,” now 2 Live Crew's “Me So Horny.”
("T won't tell your momma if you don't tell your dad | I
know he'll be disgusted
when he sees your p—
y busted.” ) Innovative.
When that is “main-
stream,” this will be an
interesting country.

2 Live Crew, who
are black, resemble the
cretinous Andrew Dice
Clay, the white “come-
dian.” There is nothing
new about selling the
talentless to the tasteless. What is new is the combina-
tion of extreme infantilism and menace in the profit-
driven degeneration of popular entertainment. This
slide into the sewer is greased by praise. When jour-
nalism flinches from presenting the raw reality, and
instead says only that 2 Live Crew's lyrics are
“explicit” and “controversial” and “provocative,”
there is an undertone of approval. Antonyms of those
adjectives are “vague” and “bland” and “unchalleng-
ing.” Somehow we never reach the subject of busting
vaginal walls.

America today is capable of terrific intolerance
about smoking, or toxic waste that threatens trout. But
only a deeply confused society is more concerned
about protecting lungs than minds, trout than black
women. We legislate against smoking in restaurants;
singing “Me So Horny” is a constitutional right. Sec-
ondary smoke is carcinogenic, celebration of torn
vaginas is “mere words.”

Words, said Aristotle, are what set human
beings, the language-using animals, above lower ani-
mals. Not necessarily.

harassment.

What are the common threads connecting Will’s
argument to Bucknell University? Our detachment
from the “real world” does not shelter us from the
issues of free speech, sexism, and blatant disregard for
basic human respect. Last semester, the Bucknell com-
munity was bombarded with very similarly degrading
rhetoric—so similar, in fact, that even the words sound
the same....

In the May 11, 1990 issue of The Bucknellian,
Jessica Henry, a Bucknell senior, brought a blatantly
sexist incident to the attention of our community. A
“Step show” performed by the Kappa Alpha Psi frater-
nity provoked this response:

There is...a fine line between the — P'S
exercise of free speech and

.. After an exciting first step dance, one of the Brothers
explained there was something called a “Kappa-tude.”
At first amused by this witticism, I was soon seething.
It seems this “Kappa-tude" gives the Kappa brothers
license to completely degrade and mock women.
According to their song, Kappas can “cum” in
women's eyes, ears, and between their legs at any time
and any place, and women love it—by virtue of their
“Kappa” status.

Another song consisted, in large part, of the
Phrase “motherf—-er.” I could not believe I had actu-
ally paid $4 to hear six men chant “motherf—er!!”

In the April 6, 1990 issue, J.T. Klopcic, a junior,
penned his reaction to
the messages he found
scribbled on the cam-

sidewalks, the

handiwork of an organi-
zauion calling _ itself

M.U.F.F. (Men Upset

by F—-ing Feminists):

— Gary Sojka

Quite simply, _ this

chalk message read, “A

woman is first and fore-
most life support for a p—y.” ...if the sexist remarks
found scrawled on the sidewalk represent even a small
sample of campus opinion, then the feminists’ case for
sexism here at Bucknell has been proven

Finally, even President Gary Sojka found the
sexist and racist trends on campus to be intolerable,
and chose to express his concern in his May 4, 1990
letter to the Editor:

... Offensive comments, lewd references, and unflatier-
ing portrayals of women and members of minority
groups have appeared in chalk on the sidewalks or
have been shouted at students in passing. There is, of
course, a fine line between the exercise of free speech
and harassment... However, operating within the
realm of protected free speech, some members of our
community seem to take pleasure in taunting, abusing,
and otherwise “bashing” their fellow students. It is my
personal opinion that although protected speech may
apply, such behaviors are clearly an abuse of the right
of free expression. I abhor the vulgarity, the malicious-
ness, the lack of sensitivity and tolerance such behav-
ior bespeaks.

This is the point where Bucknell meets the out-
side world. These views that President Sojka expresses
echo the voice of George Will. The abuses that we find
on our Own campus, protected under the pretense of
free speech, are equivalent to those which make front
page headlines of the nation’s newspapers.

Freshman Forum

None of

us here at Bucknell are strangers to the mixed feelings

which we all felt before our arrival at college. The end of summer was
accompanied by a sense of great anticipation. Rather oddly, emotions

such as fear and sorrow were common as well. Almost no one could

of Mom and Dad. By the same token, few people wanted to say good-

bye to their high school sweethearts or part with the friends who had

Any surprises? For your
sakes I hope not, but I am sure that
there are. The people listed above
are your representatives, and it is
your duty to see to it that they vote
the way you want. So you ask what
do I do? Well here are just a few
things that I feel are necessary:

1) Never underestimate the
power of BSG, or for that matter,
any group on this campus.

2) Make sure that you
express your feelings and concerns
to your various representatives.
They are called representatives
because they are supposed to be
representative of your feelings
about an issue, regardless of
whether they feel that is the case or

shared every special moment with you. But the hopes of freedom, par-
ties and new faces pulled you away from the familiar security blanket
which you call “home.”

That was one month ago almost to the day. We have started to
make new friends and we have certainly been to enough parties. In ret-
rospect, was it everything we expected? This is the time when home
Starts to seem farther and farther away. As strange as it may seem, I
have heard people say that they miss those same parents who thirty
days ago were so “restrictive and unfair.” I will not go as far as to call
this homesickness, but I will say that in an environment where we
have been faced with so many new and difficult experiences, it is
expected that we will yearn for that security which is so hard to find in
the hustle and bustle of college life.

It is at this point in the year when we somehow “forgot” to do
any of our English reading and it seems that all of our work is catching
up with us instead of us with it. Our lives, so it may seem at times, are
in a state of near total disarray. Is this really the independence and
responsibility that we wanted for so many years? One girl assured me
that it is not. She tried to convince me that “we should not have to do

ways it is. We are slowly being introduced to the state of confusion
which we call life. Isn’t it fun?

As semi-reality crashes down on us freshmen, people begin to
panic. It is my advice to sit back, calm down and put things in perspec-
tive. While your social life and grades are important, let’s try to pre-
serve a little sanity. When the experience is over, friendships and
grades will more than likely be more stable than they are now and we
will be able to look back and examine the results. I am sure that the

Living Colour comes on strong

By Jon Elliot

In 1988, Living Colour
released their debut album entitled
Vivid, which gained mainstream
acceptance with such MTV hits as
“Cult. of Personality” and
“Glamour Boys;” yet many
labeled Corey Glover, Vernon
Reid, Muzz Skillings and Wil-
liam Calhoun as the up-and-
coming “black rock and roll
band” to hit the pop charts

But to the educated histo-
rian, musical or otherwise, it
was such artists as Little Rich-
ard, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino
as well as the countless number
of African-American bluesmen
(and women) who actually
“invented” what has been
labeled Rock and Roll by main-
stream America.

eye-opening rhetoric, the mood
seems to be lost in what is Reid’s
only attempt on Time’s Up to
release himself from the album’s
theme, that being a cultural educa-
tion of the masses.

The lyrical tempo is once
again raised in “New Jack Theme”
and “Someone Like You” which
flow as smoothly as Reid’s guitar
work, telling the stories of inner-
city life, junkies, racism and teen
pregnancy.

It is not until “Elvis Is Dead”
that we see Colour’s lighthearted

seriousness come to the forefront.

With a guest “rap” by Little Rich-

ard, talk of Elvis being spotted in

shopping malls creates a light tone

on a subject which Reid creatively

manipulates to fit the album’s
theme (Elvis was a hero to most/
But that’s beside the point/ A
Black man taught him how to
sing/ And then he was crowned
king).

“Type,” the first single and
MTV video from the album, is
undoubtably the pinnacle of this
considerably solid work. What
follows in the remaining seven
tracks is, lyrically, in step with
the first half of the album, but
musically Living Colour is one
creative step beyond.

“Information Overload”
opens with a computerized, syn-
thesized gut-wrenching Vernon

* Reid lead, ultimately blending
into a solid prucussion sound. It
is Queen Lalifah and Doug E.
Fresh (of Rap fame) who lend
their vocal ability to the bass
sounds of “Under Cover of
Darkness” (Queen Latifah),
“Tag Team Partners” and
“Solice of You” (Fresh).

It is, therefore, the rhyth-
mic bass sounds of “Ology,”
void of Glover's vocals or
Reid’s guitar, which sets the

pace for what proves to be a strong
Skilling bass-oriented finish to
quite an astonishing work displayed
by what Living Colour hopes main-
stream America will take as a seri-
ous talent in the Rock and Roll
community, rather than using the
group’s African heritage as a
means of musical asessment.

Weis Series Begins

By Julie Bachman
Staff Writer

Here’s your chance folks. Its
time to become a cultured, edu-
cated, and well-versed-in-the-arts
individual. The Weis Center kicks
off its performance season tonight
with a version of Shakespeare’s
“Two Gentlemen of Verona,” a
comedy about the betrayal of broth-
erly friendship by romantic love,

The play will be performed
by The Acting Company, the offi-
cial touring entourage of the John
F. Kennedy Center for the Perform-
ing Arts in Washington, D.C. This
touring ensemble was founded in
1972 by Margot Harley and John
Houseman. It is the only perma-
nent, professional reperatory thea-
tre touring nationwide and_ has
promulgated the likes of Patti
LuPone and “A Fish Called
Wanda’s” Kevin Kline.

Over the years, the Company
has received numerous awards,
including the Los Angeles Drama

Critics Circle Award and several
Obies. It has traveled more than
400,000 miles in 46 states, per-
forming its reperatory of 66 plays.

William Boswell, director of
cultural events at Bucknell,
plugged, “I’m very pleased that we
were able to attract such a high
quality theatrical company and I
consider us lucky to have the
opportunity to see Shakespeare so
well and professinally perfomed. It
should proved to be a rare treat...a
great play done in an understanda-
ble, clear and, I expect, very funny
manner.”

So don’t miss tonight’s per-
formance by what Boswell consid-
ers, “One of the finest theatre com-
panies in America to perform one
of the greatest comedies ever
penned.” This performance is being
raved about ladies and gentle-
men...DON’T MISS IT.

For ticket information, call
the Weis Center Box Office before
5:30 tonight, at 524-1000. (Or get
your tickets at the door.)

Poet in profile

By Christena Johnston

Lisa Coffman (pictured at
left) is Bucknell University’s resi-
dent poet for the sememster. Coff-
man was born in Virginia and grew
up in Tennessee. She became inter-
ested in poetry at an early age, but
chose not to pursue this interest in
college. Instead, Coffman majored
in computer science at the Univer-
sity of Tennessee. It was at college
that Coffman took a writing work-
shop and realized her true interest.
Following her college graduation in
1985, Coffman went to New York
University to complete her masters
degree in the University’s writing
program.

Coffman writes poetry and
fiction. Her fiction has appeared in
“Violet.” Her poetry, drawn from
family, history, friends and stories
collected from personal experi-
ences, is a type of lyrical verse
about herself or those she knows.
Her works have been published in
“Arc,” “The Minetta Review,” and
“West Branch,” Bucknell’s literary
magazine.

Currently, Coffman is explor-
ing with free verse and experiment-
ing with different forms, meters,

rhythms and styles in her poetry.
Although Coffman also writes short
stories, she gravitates toward
poetry since she finds it easier to
work with poems than stories.

In addition to writing poetry,
Coffman is a staff writer for The
North Jersey Herald and News.
At times she thought she wanted to
teach, but decided that being a jour-
nalist and having a job in the “real”
world would be the best thing to
do. Being a journalist however, is
more difficult than one expects.

Currently she is enjoying
campus life at Bucknell and having
a chance to break free of New York
City, where she has lived for four
years. She is thrilled to be the resi-
dent poet at Bucknell, and she is
happy to be recognized on campus
as a poet as it is oftentimes difficult
to be recognized solely on the basis
of one’s writing.

Coffman’s stay at Bucknell
will be a real shaping time fo her
work since she has the opportunity
to concentrate on her writing every
day. Coffman’s goal is to create a
book of peotry. Along with her
writing, she is collaborating on a
creative writing workshop, and
helping to critique poems. She is

The Blind Man's Norm

By Charles MacAulay Heflin

His mind is pounding in and out,
Computers blinking orange and green,
The men around him scream and shout,

His eyes are fixed upom this screen.

‘The caffeine makes his body shake,
His breath is short, his heart is fast,
His coffee makes him stay awake,
His frenzied state all day will last.

Choked with phones so black and loud,
Eardrums pierced by screaming greed,
Ulcers, headaches, cash endowed,
With buying and selling with speed.

Black with smoke his lungs are scarred,
Lighting, puffing, streams of grey,

‘The end of his ring finger charred,
From lighting cigarettes all day.

In his throat and out his nose,
Rings of smokey drifts he blows,
As he screams his ulcer grows,
When he ll burst nobody Knows.

Buying, selling, trading stock,
‘Ticker tapes are whizing by,
Racing trades against the clock,
All which ends at buzzer's cry.

Some never leave this business craze,
Travelling home in money's spell,
Spending evenings in a daze,
Trapped in greed's ulcerous well.

Fluctuations of a price,

Can turn a calm into a storm,
So if you're tired take this advice,
Don't fool around with blind man's norm.

Use your mind and work from there,

And don't let worries rule your life,

Keep your mind clean and think with care,
Then working days won't end in strife.

Rhythm Kings
entertain alumni

By Ally Kambach

On September 22, The Man-
hattan Rhythm Kings performed at
the Weis Center. The three mem-
bers, Hal Shane, Brian Nalepka,
and Tripp Hanson, performed
music from the 20’s, 30’s, and
40’s.

The Rhythm Kings have
appeared at Carnegie Hall, Radio
City Music Hall, and the Kennedy
Center. They toured Russia with
Broadway star Tommy Tune in
1988. They have been a part of
several PBS music specials includ-
ing the Emmy Award-wining “Cel-
ebrating Gershwin”.

The group has appeared with
artists such as George Burns, Dom
Deluise, Judy Collins, Helen
Reddy, Gregory Hines, Chita Riv-
era, and the Rockettes. Recently
they completed their third album.

The concert was the climax
of a weekend designed to celebrate
the end of Bucknell University’s
fund raising campaign. The audi-
ence, the majority of whom were
contributing alumni, had been
treated to a weekend of activities in

thanks for their generous gifts and
pledges. The performance was pre-
ceeded by an elaborate dinner for
the alumni which was held in the
Fieldhouse. $90.9 million was
raised for the University in its
recent campaign.

The Rhythm Kings combined
classic music with tap dancing to
create a show which was musically
and visually exciting. Accompa-
nied by pianist Jeremy Kahn and
drummer Amie Kinsella, the trio
was free to dramatize their selec-
tions. The tap dancing by Shane
and Hanson was enthusiastically
received by the audience. Songs
performed, such as “Yes Sir, That’s
My Baby” and “Puttin? On The
Ritz”, bridged the gencration-gap
so that young and old were able to
enjoy the same sounds.

People who shyed away from
this evening of “classic music”
turned their backs on the beginings
of rock and roll. Their enjoyment
of the music spilled into the audi-
ence. Enthusiasm was the over-
whelming effect. I enjoyed listen-
ing to this distinctly different
sound.

also available to students to discuss
their writing from 2:15 to 3:15p.m.
every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. Her office is located in
Bucknell Hall.

Coffman is also involved in a
modem dance class which she finds
extremely interesting as it is “cross-
training in another art.” Although

she won’t be dancing in perfor-
mances, the dance company has
expressed interest in choreograph-
ing a piece to one of her poems for
a December dance recital.

Last night, Lisa Coffman
gave a poetry reading in Bucknell
Hall.

Bucknellian

Gen. Lee Speaking | Joe Ely opens next Friday night

By Lee Guzofski

Greetings once again
Bucknellians! It is I returning to
offer my insights into the world
of cinema. This week I had the
pleasure of viewing Presumed
Innocent starring Harrison Ford,
Brian Dennehy, and Bonnie
Bedelia. This film was an adapta-
tion of Scott Turow’s novel of
the same title. A novel which I,
regrettably, have not yet read.
But then I think, who cares? I
review movies, not novels...

This was the story of
Rusty Sabitch, district attorney
extraordinaire who is framed for
the murder of one of his col-
leagues, Carolyn Polhemus.
However, she wasn’t just any
colleague; au contraire dear
reader, Rusty had a torrid love
affair with her, an affair that
threatened to end his marriage.
(Ooh, ooh, twist that plot!) At
any rate, she has been ruthlessly
killed in what appears to be a
rape attempt and Rusty, upstand-
ing member of the community
and all-around neato guy, is sud-
denly thrust into the role of
prime suspect. The rest of the
story revolves around Rusty’s
attempts to prove his innocence.
To tell any more of the plot
would be to do a cruel injustice
to you, the reader...

Firstly, Harrison Ford is
my favorite actor on the face of

the planet. Not that you care, but
I wanted to get that out of the
way because I was biased from
the start. However, this film has
actual merits of its own, even
though Ford trades in his fedora
and bullwhip for a briefcase and
wingtips. The plot twists and
winds its way from one suspense-
ful scene to another, leaving the
viewer breathless. Ford is bril-
liant in his role as the plagued
prosecutor although his haircut is
the most pathetic “do” since his
role in Blade Runner. Bonnie
Bedela, formerly known only for
her role as Bruce Willis’ wife in
the Die Hard films, plays a stun-
ningly intriguing wife. Okay,
here’s the deal: Harrison Ford
kicks big box-office tushie with
his amazing portrayal. The story
is entrancing, throwing doubt on
virtually everyone, even up to the
very end. WOW, what a flick! In
summation, I would recommend
this film to anyone who enjoys
an intelligent, suspenseful, bril-
liant movie that leaves the audi-
ence feeling completely satisfied
and involved with the characters.
If this sort of quality film doesn’t
appeal to you; well, there’s
always Robocop 2... Thank you,
have a nice yesterday and a
pleasant next Thursday.

Quartet with a twist

Soldier String Quartet gives
classical music a new image

By Joyce Dollinger

On Wednesday, the Soldier
String Quartet, performing classi-
cal, jazz, and avant-garde type
music, will make their first Buck-
nell appearance. The group’s per-
formance will mark the beginning
of the Gallery Series musical per-
formances of the year. The series is
performed in the Center Gallery of
the Elaine Langone Center.

The “Quartet” was formed
during the spring of 1985 by Dave
Soldier who is the leading musician
and composition writer for the
group. His music uses “poly-
rhythms and syncopations derived
from funk and serial techniques and
frequently include rock drum sets,”
which he sythesized from working
with Bo Diddley in the past. Mr.
Soldier also has a Ph.D in neurobi-
ology from Columbia University.

The other members of the
group are: Laura Seaton, first vio-
linist; Ron Lawrence, violinist; and
Mary Wooten, cellist. On Wednes-
day the Soldier String Quartet will
have a fifth musician. Michael
Suchorsky is a drummer who
toured six years with Lou Reed. He
will be accompanying the band for
the evening.

The extensive repertoire of
The Soldier String Quartet might
cause some confusion among new
listeners The “Quartet” plays vari-
ous types of music in order to
express their varying ideas and var-
ying musical tastes.

The group’s music represents
at least fifty new works by different
artists such as; Elliott Sharp, who
leads a new wave band called Car-
bon, Nicholas Collins, Ivan Wysch-

negradsky, Iannis Xenakis, Joanne
Brackeen, Teo Macero, Diana
Mecklley and Richard Peaslee. The
Quartet entertains as well as
records albums with; Elliott Sharp
& Carbon, Amina Claudine Myers,
Tom Cora, Nicholas Collins, Wil-
liam Schimmel, the Tango Project,
Teo Macero and the SEM
Ensemble.

In addition, the Quartet is
currently in residence for the Amer-
ican Festival of Microtonal Music.
They also play the annotated works
by some American greats like
Muddy Waters, James Brown, and
Tito Puente.

The Soldier String Quartet
has two albums out, Sequence
Girls (Rift Records), focusing on
the music of Dave Soldier, and
Hammer, Anvil, Stirrup (SST),
collaborated by Elliott Sharp for
the group. Their third album,
Sojourner Truth (Newport Clas-
sics), will appear in January of
1991,

Although the name might be
deceiving at first, the Soldier String
Quartet is not your typical ties and
tails quartet. The group’s style and
repertoire are quite different from
the traditional notion of clssical
music. During the past year the
group has been receiving a good
deal of attention in New York City
and has played at Lincoln Center
and at city clubs, such as CBGB’s.
They have also traveled throughout
Europe and North America on tour.

The Soldier String Quartet
will be performing Wednesday at 8
p.m. in the Center Gallery. The
concert is titled “Five Little Mon-
sters.” The Gallery Series is open
and free to the public.

Staff Writer

Next Friday, Joe Ely, noted
guitarist and singer will be opening
for Little Feat. Ely has been play-
ing Texas roadhouse rock for the
past twenty years. He released his
first album, titled Joe Ely (MCA),
in 1977, and he has continued to
perform and record throughout the
past two decades.

The band which Ely currently
plays with has been with him for
five years. Ely finds that his inspi-
ration comes from his band. “The
band has always influenced the
way I approach a song and the way
that I sing it.” That influence
should be loud and clear in Ely’s
performance next Friday night.

His band’s influence on his
music should also be quite notica-
ble in his new album, Live at Lib-
erty Lunch (MCA), which will be
released in mid-October. The
album was recorded last spring at
Austin’s Liberty Lunch. It is Ely’s
sixth album on MCA, but he also
has a couple of albums produced by
other recording companies.

Throughout his career, Ely
has made tour appearances with
greats such as The Rolling Stones
and Tom Peity. Around the time of

The Soldier String Quartet will be performing “Five Little Monsters” on Wednesday night in the
“Country Blues #2,” by Muddy Waters and “Round Midnight,’

Down on the Drag (MCA), Ely’s
album released in 1979, The Joe
Ely Band was invited to tour with
The Clash in Europe. Other
national acclaim which Ely has
recently received was the naming
of his album, Masquerade (MCA),
as “one of the top albums to
emerge from the 1970s.”

It seems as if time is on Ely’s
side, as each year his natioal rec-
ogntion increases, and he becomes
more publicly recognized as a solid
musician. In the past decade Ely
has performed at Live Aid and
appeared on The Roy Orbison Trib-
ute, and famous singers such as
Linda Ronstadt have personally
recognized Ely’s talent. She was
noted as saying, “Joe Ely is a true
original. This is real Texas Rock
and Roll at it’s finest.”

The Joe Ely Band is expected
to produce a strong opening act.
Ely’s attitiude about the stage is
one of enthusiasm as well as
respect for the audience. “Before I
step foot on a stage, I make certain
thet I’m damn-sure ready. I don’t
get on the stage if I’m feeling just
ho-hum. I am cosiderate of every
crowd, whether it’s in Helsinki or
Amarillo, it doesn’t matter where I
am. If people have enough time to
get out of their houses to see a

Two weekends ago, Buck-
nell’s water polo squad traveled to
the U.S. Naval Academy in Annap-
olis for the annual Eastern League
Tournament, featuring the top polo
squads this side of the Mississippi.
The Bison first played Army in
what Coach Lynn Kachmarick
called “a very solid game.”

Bucknell came out strong and

never looked back. After jumping
to a commanding 7-2 halftime edge
over the Cadets, the squad cruised
to an 11-5 victory. John Zeigler ‘91
and Walter Kelly ‘92 led the way
with three goals apiece. Kevin
Schroth ‘92 and Kelly also contrib-
uted three assists. John Bradbury

registering 12 saves.

top seed. Though the Bison gave a

their new 6-2 offense. However,
the Wildcats were ready to meet the
challenge when the Lady Bison
arrived. Villanova took three
straight games from the squad 15-
10, 15-8, 15-5, dropping Bucknell's
record to 2-7.

“If there is such a thing as
playing well and losing, then we
did it,” said Coach Opalski.

The Lady Bison went right
after the Wildcats from the opening
serve with their 6-2 offense, a for-
mation which utilizes two setters.
The key players in the 6-2, Dee
Scinta ‘92 and Mary Jordan ‘93,
who dished out a total of 28 assists
for the match, with senior co-
captain Kris Colbert putting down
ten for kills. Other good bearers of
the 6-2 were co-captain Kara Foro-

nova spikes, and Scinta was able to
come up with five digs.

“They [Villanova] had a
really impressive warm-up, but our
kids were not intimidated,” said
first-year assistant coach Anne
Marie Larese. “We played really
well in spurts, but we were just
lacking a little consistency in our
serve reception.”

Bucknell will try to improve
upon their league-leading .282 hit-
ting percentage when they travel to
West Point to take on Army tomor-
row in their first Patriot League
match of the season. The Lady
Bison will also face Colgate,
another member of the Patriot
League, while they are at Army.

The

tremendous effort, they bowed to
the Bears in double overtime, 8-6.
Tim Smaldone ‘90 led Bucknell
with a hat trick of three goals,
while Zeigler added three assists.

The Bison played their third
and final game of the day against
arch-rival Iona. Though tired fol-
lowing an already long afternoon,
Bucknell registered a fine perfor-
mance before yielding 10-7. Kelly
led a balanced attack of seven
Bison scorers, contributing two
goals. Smaldone and Chris Retzler
“92 added two assists apiece.

The next day, Bucknell
played its final game of the long
tournament against Princeton.
Kachmarick simply stated, “We
played great and won.” Schroth led
the Bison with a couple of goals
and three assists, while Kelly
scored a triplet of goals and added
a single assist in an 11-6 winning
effort. John Bradbury played
exceptionally in goal, tallying nine
saves. This win capped what Coach
Kachmarick dubbed “‘a great week-
end.” Bucknell finished 7th among
a field of 16 teams.

This past weekend, the polo
team traveled to Brown University

Bucknellian

in Providence for what proved to be
a very challenging tournament.
Bucknell played the top three teams
in the nation: #1 Cal-Berkley, #2
UCLA, and #3 Cal-Irvine. The Cal-
ifornia teams overpowered Buck-
nell and won easily, but Kachma-
rick stressed, “We were able to
leam something from each game.
Even though we lost big, the team
stayed tough, and never gave up.”

With this past weekend
behind them, the polo team is look-
ing forward to another competitive
weekend at Villanova for the Wild-
cat Invitational Tournament. The
Bison will face Johns Hopkins and
Cornell in the opening two rounds.

The polo squad has made
some great strides thus far this sea-
son. Kachmarick notes, “You can-
not only measure success by wins
and losses. It’s the attitude and
growth of our team, which has con-
tinued to be the best group I have
ever coached here.”

With the strong support of
their coach behind them and and
intense competitive attitude within
them, Bucknell should rank favora-
bly —_ against its upcoming
Opponents.

Golf places tenth out of fifteen
in Georgetown Invitational

By Jamie Diaferia

The golf team participated in
the Georgetown Invitational last
weekend in Fredericksburg, Vir-
ginia, placing tenth in a fifteen-
team field. The tournament indi-
cated definite signs of improvement
from the F&M Sheraton Tourna-
ment a week earlier, in which
Bucknell finished fifteenth in the
24-team tournament.

At Georgetown the Bison
averaged eighty strokes per person
which, according to Coach Tommy
Thompson, is regarded as an excel-
lent score, especially for such a
young team.

With the success of the past
weekend, the Bucknell golfers are
looking ahead to the Susquehanna
Tournament on September 28th, in
which Thompson has decided to go
with a revamped team.

The Bison opened last week-
end’s tournament on a sunny Fri-
day by shooting a combined 322,

which was two strokes better than
the opening round of the F&M tour-
nament a week earlier.

Don Hansen ‘94 led the team
once again, shooting a 77, followed
by Scott Miller ‘93, who shot a
respectable 79. Doug Dollenberg
“94 and Dave Fries ‘93 also played
well, shooting 82 and 84 respec-
tively, while captain Mike Smigie
“92 struggled a bit early on, shoot-
ing an 89.

The scores for the day repre-
sented significant improvement for
the team, thus gaining them confi-
dence for the next day.

Along with the arrival of the
second day of the tournament came

-the rain, as play was delayed for 45
minutes. The team played well
despite the conditions, as Hansen
once again led the team, shooting a
74, and finishing at 151 for the two
days, good enough to place 13th
overall. Dollenberg shot a 79 to fin-
ish at 161, in 38th place. Fries, Smi-
gie and Miller also played well, as

Beats Lafayette, loses to Lehigh

By Christopher Mosunic
Staff Writer

The Bucknell women’s tennis
team remained at .500 after a 1-1
weekend, as they defeated Lafay-
ette on Saturday but fell to Lehigh
on Sunday. The Lady Bison put on
a strong performance each day and
kept their record even at 2-2.

In the Lady Bison’s match at
Lafayette, Bucknell was led by its
strong doubles squads and out-
standing single performances by
Karen Stagliano ‘92, Stephanie
Ryer ‘91, and Kymm Carlson ‘94.

Bucknell came out on fire
and held on for the remainder of
the match. Coach Ewan com-
mented, “This is the first time in a
number of years that we have
beaten Lafayette. Every team mem-
ber contributed to this win.”

Stagliano led Bucknell’s
charge against the Leopards, drill-
ing her opponent 6-0, 6-2.

Also winning their singles
matches were Carlson and Ryer.

Carlson pummeled her oppo-
sition 6-0, 6-4. Ryer took the first
set easily, but she had her hands
full in the second. The set went
game for game until the players
reached a tiebreaker. Each competi-
tor matched one another point for

point. At 6-all Ryer took two
Straight to take the tiebreaker 8-6
and the match.

Each of the doubles teams
performed admirably. Though all
three matches went three sets,
Bucknell was victorious in every
effort.

Mary Ann Benack ‘92 and
Carlson played fiercely, winning
the first set and forcing a tiebreaker
in the second. Benack and Carlson
took the tiebreaker (7-1) for the

they shot 80, 84
respectively.

Hansen was pleased with the
results, remarking, “It was really
encouraging that, despite the
inclement weather, the team was
able to gain ground and surpass
some teams like Seton Hall.”

Dollenberg agreed, saying,
“The team’s score in the tourna-
ment was encouraging, but still
allows us room for improvement.”

Coach Thompson was espe-
cially excited about the way the
team played over the weekend.
“There was definite improvement
since last week,” he said. “I am
very encouraged. To finish tenth
when you’re playing with teams
like Princeton and William and
Mary is impressive. We’re getting
closer to having four good scores
each time out, and now we are just
looking to break 310.”

With the Susquehanna Tour-
nament coming up, Thompson has
decided to go without three of his

and 86

regular players, as he is opting to
try three untested players. Hansen
and Miller will be joined by Glenn
Hertzberg ‘92, Chris Curti ‘94, in
addition to a player yet to be
named.

The tournament will be a one
day affair, and will not include the
caliber of teams that have been
included in the last couple of
tournaments.

“The tournament is important
for us in that it will determine how
some of the other players can play
under pressure,” said Thompson.
“So far I have been pleased with
the way our freshmen, Dollenberg
and Hansen, have responded to the
tournaments. Now I want to see
some other players.”

This, and other future tourna-
ments, are all “tune-ups” according
to Thompson, as the ECAC Fall
Championships rapidly approach in
mid-October. “That is when we
want to do well,” said Thompson.
“Tam very optimistic.”

Field hockey loses to Colgate in OT

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

Patriot League foe Colgate
defeated the Lady Bison field
hockey team 1-0 in a hard-fought
overtime battle yesterday.

Goalie Danielle Ward °93
played remarkably, making 14
saves, before Colgate attacker
Ruthie Lynn scored the game's
lone goal 7:37 into the overtime
period.
The loss dropped Bucknell’s
record to 1-6 (0-2 in the Patriot
League). Colgate improved its

record to 4-1-1 (2-0).

With its second conference
match behind them, the field
hockey team has only two confer-
ence games remaining in the 1990
season. There will be no confer-
ence playoffs this year for the
Patriot league, and the only
playoffs in which the Bison could
aspire to compete would be the
E.C.A.C., which invites teams
with .500 records or better. Conse-
quently, the Lady Bison are con-
centrating on improving their play
and in turn, their record.

Last Saturday, the Lady

Bison gave their best performance
to date despite losing the game 1-0
to Patriot League opponent Holy
Cross. Holy Cross is an up-and-
coming team that has defeated such
well-established teams as Brown
and Boston College by no less than
three goals each this year.

The game was characterized
by strong midfield and defensive
play which held the game in a
scoreless deadlock until late in the
second half. Co-captain Jeanette

“92 had one of the most exciting
matches of the day. Their first set

the second the Lady Bison regained
their composure, winning the sec-
ond set tiebreaker 7-3.

Then Bucknell finished off its
final doubles victory of the after-
noon, as Ryer and Wyckoff won
the third set 6-4.

Bucknell played tough
against against Lehigh, but lost to
the Engineers 5-4. Coach Ewan
was extremely happy with the

teams’ play. She said, “In the past
Lehigh has beaten us 9-0; to go 4-5
with them was terrific.”

Stagliano and Ryer were vic-
torious in their singles play, and
Benack played well in defeat.

In doubles action, Lehigh’s
two top players just couldn’t be
beat. Benack and Carlson played
well, but Lehigh was hot and would
not let the Bison mount a formida-
ble challenge.

The #2 and #3 Lady Bison
doubles teams came through with
victories. Thompson and Stagliano,
and Wyckoff and Ryer cruised to
victories in their respective
matches.

The team will host Delaware

Women’s soccer beats Wilkes
in capturing first varsity win

By Anne Taback
Staff Writer

The Bucknell women’s soc-
cer team got its first victory at var-
sity status Wednesday with a 5-0
win against Wilkes University.

The team was confident and
excited going into the game.
According to Coach Toby Lovec-
chio, “they were up for this. After
the game was cancelled at Penn,
their anticipation increased and they
were looking to win.”

The team's confidence finally
paid off. Early in the game, Buck-
nell midfielder Amanda Head ‘92
rocketed a shot that Colonel goal-
keeper Diane Gibbs barely
deflected wide of the net. Keeping
the offensive pressure, Lady Bison
forward Kathy Ott ‘91 passed to
Chris O’Lare ‘93, who drilled a
shot from eight yards out for the
first Bucknell tally at 3:36.

The goal marked the first
time this season that the Lady Bison
had the opening score.

Bucknell's second goal came
at 9:08, when sweeper Stephanie
Porcaro ‘93 passed to midfielder
Christina Baselga ‘91. Baselga
notched her first assist of the game
when she fed the ball back to Por-
caro, who fired a 25-yard shot into
the back of the net.

Midfielder Janine Hudson
‘93 followed with Bucknell's third
score of the game at 24:17 in the
first half. Forward Amy Krause ‘91
passed to Baselga, who took a shot
that rebounded off the keeper. Hud-
son was there to follow up with a
shot about seven yards away from
the net.

In the second half, right back
Genine Streeper ‘92 made a direct
kick 30-yards out into the top of the
box. Forward Alyssa Meade ‘94
took control of the ball and then
took a 17-yard shot that found the
back of the net.

The last goal of the game
came in the second half, when at
40:38 Ott was able to score on a
cross from forward Tina Fields ‘94,

Field Hockey

From page 15

Aurand ‘92 said,” We played our
best game so far and the concepts
we have worked on are falling into
place—the team is starting to gel.”
The Lady Bison had good defen-
sive contributions from center back
Dana Bruce ‘92, fullback Amber
Baxter ‘92, stalwart goalie Danielle
Ward ‘93, and right mid-field
Aurand. Ward made nine saves in
the game and is fourth in the con-

-

ference with a save percentage of
856.

The Bison have struggled
throughout the year to play two
strong halves back to back. After
last Saturday, the team have shown
that it can face a top-ranked team
such as Holy Cross and be strongly
competitive.

Throughout most of the sec-
ond half, the Bison fought hard to
turn back the advances of the Lady
Crusaders and generate a cohesive

Although the Lady Bison had
built a commanding lead going
into the second half, Lovecchio
said, “They played for ninety min-
utes. They played hard the whole
game.”

The game was a big victory
for the Lady Bison, as it boosted
their morale. According to Lovec-
chio, “We went almost a month
without getting a victory and that’s
a long time. This was great for
them. They’ve worked hard,
they’ve never given up and it
finally came... they deserved to get
this victory.”

Midfielder Julie Cooling ‘94
agrees, “The ability was always
there and we just put everything
together. We’re a lot more confi-
dent.” Lovecchio labeled Cooling
as a tireless worker.

Bucknell displayed great skill
on the field. The defense was solid;
Wilkes only had seven shots,
opposed to Bucknell’s 29, and the
game was mostly played in their
half of the field.

attack of their own. It looked as
though the score would remain tied
until, with ten minutes remaining in
the game, Holy Cross converted
offensive surge into a goal.

The goal was controversial,
according to both the players and
Coach Averill. “It was a blatant off-
sides,” exclaimed high strung coach
Averill. The Holy Cross forward
dribbled past the Bison defense and
towards Bucknell goalie Ward,
creating a one-on-one situation.

The defense kept the Colo-
nels from having any good opportu-
nities for shots. Goalkeeper Bridget
Collins ‘94 played the entire game
and had many excellent saves.

The team has improved its
work on headers as well. Lovecchio
commented, “The girls directed the
ball with their heads instead of hit-
ting it anywhere which is some-
thing we were trying to work on.
We were passing the ball well,
moving to go to a space or to create
something. That was nice to see.”

Lovecchio feels that every
person that played contributed in
one way or another. He said, “Eve-
ryone got to play a fair amount of
time...we used 18 players. It was a
good team effort.”

Tomorrow's game against
Lehigh is being postponed. The
Lady Bison's next game is Tuesday,
when the team will host Gettysburg
at 4 p.m. Says Cooling, “We’re
glad to have the win now and we’re
looking to beat Gettysburg. We
really want a winning season.”

Behind the Bucknell defense, a sec-
ond Holy Cross forward camped
out by the goal for the pass and
slammed it home, giving Ward no
time to react.

The Lady Bison refused to
accept defeat and made one last
valiant effort which was rejected by
the Holy Cross defense at their own
goal line. Aurand explained,
“Though we could not capitalize,
we worked hard to hold them to
one goal. The score does not reflect
the effort involved,” commenting
on the disappointing loss.

Coach Averill praised her
team by saying, “I have seen great
progress in their play and they’ve
shown an aggressive style as well
as good anticipation [of their oppo-
nent’s moves].”

The Bison will travel to Eas-
ton, Pennsylvania, this Saturday to
face Patriot league power, and
Bucknell nemesis Lafayette. So far
this year Lafayette has continued
its annual winning campaign and
has posted a record of 4-1-0 with
no conference, games w date.
Lafayette, like Holy Cross, is anti-
cipated to be an aggressive and fast
team.

Staff Writers

In a follow-up to our daring football forecast two weeks ago, we
have retumed with more fearless predictions regarding some of this
week’s NFL action. For the past week and a half, we have crossed the
country to bring you nothing but the most accurate, reliable, up-to-the-
minute report on eight teams vying for Sunday supremacy.

Miami Dolphins (2-1) at Pittsburgh Steelers (1-2), 1 p.m.

Favorite: Miami by 1 1/2

Though the Dolphins will be hard Pressed to score points against
another superb defensive unit, the Steelers have been hard pressed to
Score points against anyone this year. Look for the acrial attack of Dan
Marino to eventually crack the Steel Curtain, as Miami squeaks by ina
low scoring game. A field goal should be the difference, so take the
Dolphins and give the point and a half.

Chicago Bears (3-0) at Los Angeles Raiders (3-0), 4 p.m.

Favorite: Los Angeles by 1

In this battle of undefeated teams, look for defense to control the
tempo of this classic match-up. Since both squads have dominating
defenses, we feel that offense will be the deciding factor. Behind the
strong running of Neal Anderson plus the better-than-anticipated play

of Jim Harbaugh, the Bears will end the Raiders’ perfect home record
under Art Shell. Take Chicago plus one.

New York Jets (1-2) at New England Patriots (1-2), 4 p.m.

Favorite: Pick ’em

Following a tough Monday night loss to the Buffalo Bills, the
Jets have an opportunity to regroup against one of the league’s weaker
teams. New England is still reeling from the 41-7 thrashing at the
hands of Cincinnati, and we expect the Jets to run up the score in this
game as well. The only problem is that the Jets Swiss cheese defense
has proven that they too can be manhandled. The Jets should prevail,
but watch for an offensive explosion (or a defensive collapse, which-
ever you prefer).

Washington Redskins (2-1) at Phoenix Cardinals (1-2), 8 p.m.

Favorite: Washington by 7

When these two teams squared-off three weeks ago, the Red-
skins impressed everyone with a 31-0 hammering of the Cardinals. But
times have changed, and so have the Redskins. Since the opening
week, Washington has lost to the 49ers, and barely beat the lowly
Cowboys at home. This week, the ‘Skins will be operating without
their starting quarterback, Mark Rypien. And don’t forget Phoenix
showed some life shocking division rival Philadelphia two weeks ago.
Though Washington might prevail, seven points is too much to con-
cede. Take the Cardinals plus a touchdown.

please note that the A’s starting centerfielder has all but wrapped-up

Athlete of the Week

Todd Hatajik ’91

After a day in which he orchestrated a 41-16 victory Over
Columbia University, Bison quarterback Todd Hatajik ‘91 sur-
faced as the clear choice for Athlete of the Week honors. Hatajik
utilized precision passing, completing 18 of 21 passes for 224
yards and four touchdowns. His completion percentage of .857
surpassed the previous Bucknell record, set by Scott Auchenbach
last season.

The four touchdown passes equalled the school record,
which is shared by five players. Hatajik’s performance earned
him the honor of Patriot League Offensive Player of the Week.

Each of the previous seasons, Hatajik has served as the
understudy to Auchenbach, Bucknell’s All-time passing leader.
Hatajik will attempt to once again lead the Bison to victory this
Saturday at Cornell.

Bison record books. Now the time
has come for Hatajik to come in
and shine, which is exactly what he
did last Saturday, leading Bucknell
to a 41-16 thrashing of Columbia at
Christy Mathewson Memorial Sta-
dium. The Bison look to improve
on their 2-1 record tomorrow, as
they face the Big Red of Cornell.

Hatajik, who hit on 18 of 21
passes for 244 yards and four
touchdowns against Columbia,
broke the Bucknell record for com-
pletion percentage (.857), and tied
the school record for touchdown
passes in a game (four). Hatajik
was named Patriot League Offen-
sive Player of the Weck for his
efforts.

Bucknell’s passing attack
was combined with a steady ground
game. The Bison rushing attack
gained 200 yards, and was led by
Brian Henesey ‘92, who scampered
for 82 yards on 19 carries.

on the five-yard line.

Barnes took a vicious hit and
had to be taken off the field. The
early prognosis indicates that

Barnes’ injury will require surgery ~

that would force him to miss the
remainder of the season.

Coach Lou Maranzana com-
mented, “His loss will have a sub-
stantial impact on the team. We
will miss him as a player. He
caught a lot of passes for us and
blocked well.”

On the ensuing play, Matt

to put the Bison up 7-0.

By Chad Bown
Staff Writer

The men’s soccer team upped
its record to 6-1 by adding two
more wins this week with victories
over Holy Cross and Millersville.

The Bison concluded their
four-game road trip at Worcester,
Massachusetts last Saturday. Buck-
nell’s Alex Kogan ‘94 and Dan
D’Angelo ‘92 opened the Bison’s
scoring in the first half, propelling
Bucknell out to a 2-0 lead just 20
minutes into the game.

Holy Cross’ Sean Casey cut
the deficit to 2-1 with a goal off a
direct kick at 37:00, but the Bison
midfielder Terry Pelino ‘91 quickly
countered with a score of his own
to restore the lead to two goals
heading into halftime.

“We had an excellent first
half where we started off really
strong,” said Coach Reynolds. “The

super-turf is a tough surface to play
on, but we made a few changes in
the lineup and had good intensity in
controlling the pace of the half.”

However, Holy Cross came
out with some pressure of their own
in the second half and controlled
play before Casey scored off
another direct kick. With just under
ten minutes remaining, he had cut
the Bison’s lead to 3-2.

But the Bucknell defense
came through under pressure and
managed to hang on for the narrow
victory.

“We just came out flat in the
second half,” said Reynolds. “We
were outplayed, yet we were lucky
that Holy Cross couldn’t capitalize
on more of our mistakes. It was a
good victory, and I’m pleased with
the win. I’m just disappointed in
our performance throughout the
second half.”

Tuesday night found the Mil-

settle for a 22-yard field goal by
Todd Krutchkoff ‘91 with 1:11 left
to play in the first quarter.

Bucknell received the foot-
ball early in the second quarter

after Columbia’s Tom Boccafola
missed a 46-yard field goal.

The Bison marched 71 yards
in 11 plays, taking almost five min-
utes off the clock before Hatajik,
on third and eight, connected with
Lester Erb ‘91 for a 19-yard touch-
down. Erb was barely able to make
the catch on the far sideline as he
kept one foot in bounds while fall-
ing out of the end zone.

The drive was highlighted by
a 14-yard first down pass from Hat-
ajik to Marc Harrison ‘92, and a
12-yard quarterback scramble by
Hatajik. The touchdown put the
Bison into a commanding 17-0
lead.

But the lead was short lived
as Columbia stormed right back on
its next possession. Following the
kickoff, the Lions drove 66 yards in
eight plays, culminating in an 11-
yard touchdown run up the middle
by Greg Abbruzzese on a draw
play.

Columbia received the ball
again after Bucknell was forced to
punt, and the Lions moved 64 yards
in ten plays, highlighted by seven
consecutive complete passes. The
drive ended with a 39-yard ficld
goal by Boccafola as the time ran
out in the half. As the teams
entered the locker room the score
stood Bucknell 17, Columbia 10.

Coach Maranzana felt the
Lions earned their way back into
the contest. “It was not a letdown
by us. I give them credit for coming
after us. We were not as good at
stopping them in the second quar-
ter. That put the game on the
ropes.”

After allowing the Lions back
into the game, Bucknell just as
quickly slammed the door follow-
ing halftime advice from Maran-
zana. The coach said, “I told them
to try harder. The situation was a
test for the team. It was a measure
of our self-confidence and our
determination. We needed to
respond.”

The offense did just that, tak-
ing the kickoff and running the ball
ten straight times. The Bison cov-

ered 63 yards before Hatajik threw
his first pass. After Hatajik called
two consecutive time-outs without
running a play, he found Pape in
traffic for a nine-yard touchdown,
extending the Bison’s lead to 24-
10.

Columbia got the ball back,
but on its third play Trevor Smith
‘91 made a diving interception on a
low-thrown ball. After the turnover
Hatajik connected with Erb on a
post pattern for a 52-yard touch-
down, making the score 31-10.

Columbia battled back, how-
ever, and on its next possession the
Lions controlled the ball for over
three minutes before scoring on a
two-yard carry by Abbruzzese.
Columbia attempted the two-point
conversion but failed, leaving the
score at 31-16.

After each team was forced
to punt, Bucknell looked to its run-
ning game. With ball control and
time-killing in mind, the Bison
drove 58 yards converting on a
four-yard pass play from Hatajik to
Dan Scocca ‘91 with 11:24 left to
play for Hatajik’s fourth touch-
down of the afternoon.

Bucknell increased its lead
again as back-up quarterback Scott
Mitchell ‘94 led a 21-yard drive to
set up a 37-yard field goal by
Krutchkoff, finishing the scoring at
41-16.

Tomorrow the Bison will
travel to Ithaca, New York, to take
on Cornell University in a non-
conference matchup where Buck-
nell will face its second Ivy League
opponent in as many weeks.

Maranzana notes, “Cornell is
the best team we’ve played yet.
They did everything they wanted
against Princeton. They were win-
ning against Colgate until Colgate
came up on them and squashed
them in the second half.”

The final score of that game
was Colgate 59, Cornell 24. Buck-
nell will look to take advantage of
the momentum generated by its
two-game winning streak. Last sea-
son Bucknell was defeated by Cor-
nell in Lewisburg, 20-9.

stop at home for the road-weary
Bison.

Ken Gulick ‘91 scored the
first Bison goal on a well executed
header off of a crossing pass from
Jon Mackenzie ‘93 at the 16:00
mark of the first half. At 5-6 and
142, Mackenzie used his speed and
determination in a gutsy perfor-
mance throughout the game.

He sparked Bucknell with a
goal of his own with just over six
minutes left in the first half to
extend the lead.

Mackenzie and Gulick used
their talents in creating havoc for
the Millersville defenders through-
out the evening. Bucknell displayed

a solid defense in the second half,
and goalie Mark Wrigley ‘94 made
a couple of fine saves to preserve
the 2-0 win.

“The key to tonight was that
we came out strong and attacked in
the first half,” said tri-captain Terry
Pelino ‘91, who played adeptly in
controlling the midfield all game.
“We’ve had trouble in the second
half of many games this season, but
we played consistently for the
entire game and had a solid 90-
minute effort tonight.”

“We knew Millersville would
play a solid game, and we knew it
wouldn’t be easy.” stated a more
contented Reynolds. “I’m pleased
with our defensive performance
and the play of our [full]backs. We
attacked well offensively keeping

the ball wide, and we got some
good crosses.”

Bucknell plays a tough con-
test tomorrow at home against Col-
gate, whom they lost to 3-0 last
year.

“They play hard and steady
and take advantage of their oppo-
nents’ mistakes,” said Reynolds.
“We need to come out and play
alertly and enthusiastically and be
ready for a close game.”

Bucknell is now 6-1 and into
the depth of their schedule, which
includes important matchups with
many of the other contenders in the
newly established Patriot League.
Tomorrow’s contest should be a
good prediction on how the Bison
will fare against some of their new
rivals.

Alcohol policy modified

Improvements made to group sanctions

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Recent student concern has
resulted in progressive changes in
the group sanctions section of the
new Alcohol Policy, according to
Mike Dominguez ‘91, president of
the Interfraternity Council (IFC).

Dominguez explained that
increasing discontent among stu-
dents and low morale in fraternity
houses prompted him to seek
changes in the treatment of groups

under the policy. “The administra-
tion was getting a lot of negative
feedback from the students as to
how the alcohol policy and security
and safety has been dealing with
enforcing the alcohol policy. So I
and others in the executive council
went in to speak with Dean of Stu-
dents John Dunlop on several occa-
sions about how several parts of
the alcohol policy were inequitable
and put IFC in a position of impo-
tence in which it could no longer
determine the sanctions and would

Trustee Access Day

to be held

today

Similar day to be held April 12

By Natalie Dunlap
Staff Writer

Eleven members of the
Board of Trustees held an “Access
Day” today for all members of the
Bucknell University community.
This program, initiated by Board
Chairman Lee Idleman, marks the
first of its kind and will take place
again next semester on April 12.

Today’s Access Day was
designed to give members of the
faculty, support staff, administra-
tors, and students an opportunity
to meet individually or in groups
with board members. Any topic
ranging from personal interests to
departmental concerns and univer-
sity policies could be brought to
the attention of the board members.
and discussed with them. Idleman
explained that the board wanted “to
keep this [Access Day] open-ended.
We leave it to members of the
campus community to set the
agenda. We want to hear what you
have to say.”

In addition to providing
members of the community a
chance to voice concerns and per-
spectives, Access Day also gave
board representatives an opportu-
nity to meet with and get to know
more personally various members

of the campus community through
the informal 15 or 30 minute
sessions.

The eleven members of the
Board of Trustees who were availa-
ble for meetings today from 10:00
a.m. until noon and 1:30-3:00
p.m. were Herbert Barness, Stewart
Berelson, Douglas Burt, Roy
Gavert, Lee Idleman, Henry Lam-
bert, Ken Langone, Jim Nevels,
Marilyn Parks, Jack Swanson, and
Robert Streeter. Joan D’Angelo,
assistant secretary to the Board of
Trustees explained that everyone
involved in Access Day was
“pleased with the geod response of
people requesting meetings.”

Following the meetings
today, a panel program, moderated
by Idleman, was held in the Gallery
Theatre of the Elaine Langone Cen-
ter beginning at 3:00 p.m. This
part of the program was open to
the entire campus community and
anyone could come and go as their
schedules permitted. The panel pro-
gram served the same purpose as
the morning meetings but, in addi-
tion, gave board members an
opportunity to address some of the
concerns and perspectives brought
out through the individual and
small group sessions.

no longer receive any part of the
monetary fines which it uses for
positive programs.”

Dominguez explained that
after the particulars of the changes
were worked out between the IFC
and Dunlop, a meeting was “‘sched-
uled with Dean Dunlop, Ed Dadez,
Mary Dorsey, the executive board
of both Panhel and the IFC, and
certain student leaders such as the
president of BSG and RHA to dis-
cuss these matters. Dean Dunlop
basically outlined the changes as
we had = gone over them
previously.”

There are four basic changes
regarding the group sanctions part
of the alcohol policy. First, accord-
ing to Dunlop, the role of peer
review will be re-extended. “The
sanctions will not be mechanically
applied, rather they will serve as
guidelines and modifications of
them can be proposed on a case by
case basis.” He added that “there
would have to be mitigating and
extenuating circumstances for mod-
ifying a particular sanction.” Dun-
lop will retain the right to approve
or send back the peer review
board’s recommendation.

Secondly, the IFC and Pan-
hel “‘are working out a schedule so
that half of the probation time will
be able to be traded for community
service for only one violation,”
according to Dominguez. Dunlop
added that this “alternative service
plan was the idea of Mary Dorsey.”

Thirdly, the executive coun-
cils of IFC and Panhel “will sit
down with the New director of
security and safety to discuss
things such as private vs. public, a
definition of probable, or reasona-
ble cause, and to develop a set sys-
tem... so that each fraternity can
expect to be treated in the same
manner.”

Finally, Dunlop is consider-
ing a proposal to distribute mone-
tary fines resulting from group vio-
lations, saying, “IFC has. been
asked by me to prepare a proposal
of its own [for fraternity fines].

Oversight of security
raises tough questions

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

The Department of Security
and Safety is in the midst of what
some might call a crisis in its per-
ceived legitimacy by students.
Regardless of whether it is the fault
of the administration, security, or
the students themselves, recent stu-
dent outbursts have shown that
security does not have the confi-
dence of the student body. Mike
Dominguez °91, president of the
Interfraternity Council | (IFC)
explained that “student confidence
in security has diminished mainly
because they feel that security has
been overstepping their bounds and
that the alcohol policy is not being
enforced equitably in residence halls
andfraternities.”

Much of this concern arises
from the fact that students feel
security has a free reign. Students
are for the most part unaware of the
procedures available to redress con-
cerns. Dominguez explained that in
the Residential Life office there are
grievance forms one can fill out
against an RA, but that no such
structure exists for security.

Security is charged by the
Policy and Procedure Manual for
Patrol Officers with certain ethical
responsibilities from the Law
Enforcement Code of Ethics.
Among these, is the duty “to
respect the Constitutional rights of
all persons to liberty, equality and
justice.” It would seem then, that
there are definite limitations upon
security, i.e. the same limitations
that would apply to police officers.

This is not the case though,
as John Dunlop, dean of students,
explained, the “campus is private
property, and there are certain rules
and regulations and constitutional
rights that cover public institutions
and public officials that don’t cover
private property. There are things
that are not binding to us because
we are a private institution.”

In addition to the private
property argument, Barry Maxwell,
vice president for administration,
explained that there are other differ-
ences that exempt security from
constitutional limitations. “Their
function is considered different that
a police officer. If there’s been a
violation of the law, they’ll contact
the police. So they’re really not act-

ing as police officers, they’re acting
as security officers. There’s a sig-
nificant difference and a very impor-
tant distinction between a police
role and a service role.” Maxwell
conceded though, that in the eyes of
students this distinction has become
blurred with phrases such as “‘secur-
ity busted us,” now commonplace.

Notwithstanding, security
does not have any legal prohibi-
tions on its enforcement of univer-
sity policy. There is one other main
area of ethics that appears in the
Law Enforcement Code of Ethics.
“T will be exemplary in obeying the
laws of the land and the regulations
of my department.” As explained
above, the laws of the land do not
restrict security based on their ser-
vice role at a private institution.
Thus, the only restrictions upon
security are the regulations of the
administration.

The Community Living
Handbook does lay out the only
written restriction on security when
it says that neither residential life
nor security may go into private
areas without “reasonable cause.”

See ACCOUNTABILITY, page 5

Administration reacts to
recent student petition

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Discontentment on the part of
students, seen in the recent petition
demanding justice within the
administration, has prompted
administrators to respond to the
state of morale in the university
community. Charlotte Jacobsen
Weddle, associate vice-president for
student life, responded to the peti-
tion noting that she and President
Gary Sojka (who was out of town
this week) were in agreement as to
the problems and possible solutions
to this wave of student unrest.

According to Jacobsen Wed-
dle, the petition was a healthy
expression of student sentiment.
She said, “I think it is a very
healthy thing for students to use
every resource they have at their
fingertips,” though she expressed
amazement and disappointment that
some people had been “shouting
out windows, telling perspective
students” not to come to Bucknell.

John Dunlop, dean of stu-
dents, explained that he has been
acutely aware of the problem of
lowered morale among students. “I
have been increasingly aware that
morale was low and getting lower
among Greeks and I understand
where they’re coming from and why
they feel so concerned... A number
of the things that bother them
should concern us, and do, and I
think that the fact that we are con-
cerned is becoming more evident.”

As far as specific action by
the University, Dunlop has sug-
gested “items for the Council on
Greek Life’s agenda,” including the
problem of morale. One of these
items is a meeting with leaders
from IFC and Panhel, and two of
the authors of the petition.

Jacobsen Weddle proposed a
“think tank group on_ general
issues, but if there’s specific grie-
vances” people should come
forward.

Jacobsen Weddle stressed that
the university is not a totalitarian
environment. “It’s not as though
this is a repressive society.” She
noted that administrators regularly
meet with students on “how to con-
structively build the future.”

Dunlop echoed the sentiment,
“Not everything is the way they
perceive, but there are some things
that are worthy of our looking at
hard and being concermed about.”

One problem Jacobsen Wed-
dle found with the petition was in
its clarity. “The dilemma is, unless

the petition is extremely clear on
what the principles are, it can be
very confusing for the people who
receive it to know [what the princi-
ples are}.” She explained that it is
necessary to delineate “general ver-
sus specific issues.”

Weddle explained, “I’ve heard
Tumors about this, but no one’s
come forward. We do need people
assertive enough [to come for
ward].” According to Jacobsen Wed
dle, everyone in the university

Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle, associate vice president for student life,

expression of student sentiment.

Jacobsen Weddle said that the
specific complaints could be regis-
tered within the existing framework
of the University. “If it’s possible
that there are violations of univer-
sity procedure, that should be inves-
tigated.” When asked about the

reports to someone, “there is abso-
lute supervisory accountability for

The Bucknellian

An evening with Security on patrol

By Lisa Hirschkorn
Staff Writer

Editor’s Note: The following arti-
cle was based on the writer’ s experi-
ence in the back of a security car,
and her interviews throughout the
evening with Sergeant Delores Staf-
ford, and with Officers Alain
McGoun and Jon Weaver

There was little excitement
for the officers of Security and
Safety on patrol Wednesday night,
simply standard operating procedure.
In maintaining security and safety
on campus, they responded to fire

night, there are three (or sometimes
four) officers patrolling in separate
cars but during house checks the
supervisor, along with another offi-
cer, will team up with one car
while at least one other officer
patrols the rest of campus. It is
standard policy for Security to
monitor houses every Wednesday,
Friday, and Saturday night, but
spot checks occur on other nights
as well.

Beginning with the Univer-
sity-owned fraternities downtown,
the checks proceeded from Sigma
Alpha Epsilon to Sigma Alpha Mu
and then Kappa Sigma. Unlike the

alarms, provided escorts, and moni-
tored activities at fraternity houses.

After joining Sergeant
Delores Stafford and Officer Alain
McGoun at 10 p.m., our evening
began with a slow start. During the
first hour of patrol, approximately
10:15 to 11 p.m., we made our
rounds throughout campus. The car
circled the golf course, fraternity
row, Seventh Street, the downhill
fraternities, the Weis Center, the
golf course again, and repeated the
rounds going at a speed of perhaps,
twenty miles per hour. From the
car, the officers double-checked
lights of buildings, made a brief
stop at the Weis Center, and contin-
ued on their way until a call from
President Gary Sojka’s house came
over the radio. A fire alarm had been
activated at Sojka’s house, close to
11 p.m., and the pace of our eve-
ning momentarily took a 180 degree
tum. Within a minute, the car
arrived on the scene and was aided
by the other security car on patrol.
By 11 p.m., the action had ended
and we returned to the Office of
Security because Officer McGoun
was going off duty, and Officer Jon
Weaver was joining us for fraternity
checks.

At approximatively 11:15
Sergeant Stafford and Officer
Weaver began their “monitoring
role” throughout the fraternity cir-
cuit. As there were no registered
parties, we spent about one and one-
half hours monitoring the houses,
but routine fraternity checks on
weekends can occupy most of their
night. According to Weaver, Secur-
ity generally spends from around 10
p.m. until 2 or 3 a.m. to monitor
houses, and, he said, “There have
been nights when we haven’t gotten
to them all” because the process is
more time-consuming when Secur-
ity has to shuffle through crowds of
students at parties. On any given

other houses, their front doors had
been previously locked by student
security monitors, and the officers
had to use their keys. Upon enter-
ing, the two officers went their
separate ways —one downstairs,
one upstairs— and walked through
hallways, basements, and most
common areas. After checking each
house, Stafford made notes on her
fraternity list, but no charges were
recorded until we reached Sammy.
At Sammy, four students had been
drinking in the basement when
Stafford went down there but they
ran away before she could get their
names. Therefore, Stafford spoke
with Trevor Stoyer ‘92, president
of Sammy and explained to him
the charges. When asked by Stoyer
if the charge would be treated as an
individual or group violation, Staf-
ford said “I don’t know. That’s up
to Residential Life to decide.”

After checking FUI, the
security car headed uphill to Tau
Kappa Epsilon. The officers con-
tinued with their procedure of one
person taking the downstairs com-
mon rooms while the other took
the hallways upstairs. Yet, other
than talking with students, the
Security officers had few immediate
priorities on their hands. Across
the way, at Chi Phi, the officers
did record a security violation
because their front door was latched
shut. The officers were unable to
enter the house with their keys
(Security has keys to all of the fra-
ternities) and had to knock on a
room window to get a fraternity
member to open the door.

Throughout the evening, the
officers responded, inside the car, to
students comments that were
printed in The Bucknellian last
week. “There are grey areas for
Security because of judgement calls
but the rules are pretty black and
white,” said Sergeant Stafford.

Stafford explained, “We have the
authority and ability and we’re paid
to make judgement calls.” Stafford
exemplified such a judgement call
at Lamda Chi Alpha. While walk-
ing through the hallway of Lamda
Chi Alpha’s main floor, Stafford
spotted a case of Busch sitting on a
shelf of an open closet. They did
not ask to see a fraternity officer
but merely informed the brothers
seated in the living room, and
warmed them about removing the
beer from the closet.

As the security car proceeded
with its first round of monitoring
all the fraternities, there were sev-
eral other houses which also
appeared to violate the the Univer-
sity’s alcohol policy. Upon enter-
ing the basement door of Sigma
Phi Epsilon, the officers immedi-
ately noticed six empty kegs situ-
ated on top of the bar area. They
realized the kegs were empty after
shaking each one, but the presence
of a keg, empty or full, at a non-
registered party is also a violation.
Yet they did not ask to see an offi-
cer in the house.

According to Stafford, Secur-
ity will check out a house before its
scheduled party if they have ques-
tions concerning any information
from the registration form that
houses submit to Residential Life.
“We ask them where the security
monitors will be, how big the party
will be, or anything that we think
is unclear,” Stafford said. If the
security car returns to a house later
in the night and the party does not
meet these demands —“...for exam-
ple, if the house has 10 kegs when
they said they were only going to
have 6,” Stafford said— then the
house would receive a violation.

Stafford explained, “The only
way to do our job if we’re not
going to be liable is to do it by the
book. We all have our different

on them for liability reasons. Staf-
ford explained that the officers have
“Log Sheets” and “we have to fill
them out. They know when we’re
in there [the fraternity house] and
when we come out.”

Approaching Sigma Chi, we
saw three students, apparently on
lookout for Security, standing out-
side the front door. While pulling
up to the house, the officers pre-
dicted that one of them would go
inside when they noticed the Secur-
ity car, and it turned out the officer
was right. The officers proceeded
with their routine but after hearing
neither sounds of a party nor seeing
any open beers, Security moved on.
Earlier that evening, Officer Alain
McGoun had claimed, “an officer
would never go into a room unless
another officer was being trained [if
one security officer were training a
new officer]. If we would do some-
thing that infringes on someone’s
rights, then it’s a poor judgement
call.”

McGoun had also explained
that when Security responds to fire
alarms at fraternities, they often
charge houses with alcohol viola-
tions. McGoun cited an incident at
Delta Upsilon where Security
responded to a fire alarm that went
off outside the bathroom and, when
Security walked by, they saw a
tapped keg through the doorway.
According to McGoun, “students
said that we infringed on their
rights.” Stafford added, “the door
was open and bathrooms are com-
mon areas.” In other instances, fra-
ternities have left closet doors open
when there are tapped kegs or cases
of beer inside and Security sees the
alcohol while walking through the
houses on their routine checks.

According to McGoun and
Stafford, Security procedures are
standard, and students would face
harsher punishments if Lewisburg

Stay on their [the fraternity’s] good

During my first hour patrol-
ling with Security, Officer McGoun
had said, “Students nark on other
students,” and Security must
respond to their complaints. Out-
side Lamda Chi Alpha one evening,
a student told Security there was a
keg in the bathroom, but the stu-
dent wouldn’t give her name. Staf-
ford said “I couldn’t get the name of
the individual because that would
have been an infringement on her
rights.” Security claims that they
often receive such anonymous com-
plaints and that it is their job to act

Whereas the police would issue
citations immediately, McGoun
explained that “we take a name, list
it on the residential hall violation
sheet, and that person is sanctioned
by Residential Life.” Compared to
state law repercussions, both
McGoun and Stafford agreed that
“two weeks [of social probation] is
a small price to pay.” Stafford
claimed that “Even if students break
the rules and they know they’re
breaking the rules they look at us
as the bad guys.” She said, “People

Security policies at four
Pa. schools compared

By David Murray
Staff Writer

In light of the questions being raised about our Office of
Security and Safety, The Bucknellian has contacted Directors of
Security and Safety at four of our “frame of reference” schools:
Lafayette College, Swarthmore College, Dickinson University, and
Gettysburg College. The policies and procedures implemented at
those institutions may be contrasted with our own.

On the question of entry into private student residence hall
rooms, the four Directors were unanimous. All must have ‘probable
cause’ to enter such a room, and all four compared their procedure
with that of “a regular police force.” The only exception to the
‘probable cause’ rule is in the event of imminent life or property
damage such as a hostage situation or a fire.

Two of the schools’ policies further stipulate that Security
must obtain a judicial search warrant prior to entering a student’s res-
idence hall room uninvited, and at Lafayette, a “search authorization
from the Dean of Students’ office” must be obtained.

At the universities surveyed which have fraternity and sorority
houses on campus, the Security policy was similar. Private student
rooms can not be entered without ‘probable cause’ or an imminent
threat to life or property; however, the public areas of fraternity
houses, including bar rooms, hallways, and lounges, are patroled fre-
quently. At Dickinson, Dick Eckenrode, the acting director of safety
and security, added “but we don’t send in guys unannounced” and the
Director at Swarthmore, Owen Redgrave, mentioned “we don’t go in
except by invitation, but typically we’re invited to go in.” He con-
tinued, “{Security and the fraternities) have a fairly open
relationship.”

In general, Eckenrode of Dickinson said that a student’s room,
whether in a residence hall or a fraternity house, should be considered
“the same as a private home” when it comes to search and seizure.
“We don’t want to just walk in the door and check on some girl,”
Eckenrode joked. Furthermore, he believes that ‘probable cause’
“should be a policy everywhere.” Hugh Harris, Lafayette’s director of
security and safety, added that obtaining a ‘search authorization’ and
entering a student’s private room is both “uncommon” and “very
infrequent.”

Concerning the issues of oversight and evaluation, The Buck-
nellian has learned that at all four educational institutions, the direc-
tor of security and safety reports directly to an administrator (a vice
president, a dean, a treasurer, and the head of the business office). In
addition, however, three of the schools currently utilize a committee
system to review the practices and policies of Security, and discus-
sion about forming such a committee is currently taking place at the
fourth school, Gettysburg.

At Swarthmore and Dickinson, security and safety committees
meet regularly to evaluate the department. The committees are com-
prised of students, faculty, and staff, and are chaired by the director of
security and safety. Recommendations from those committees con-
cerning changes in Security’s policies and practices go to the over-
seeing administrator for review and potential inclusion in university
policy. At Lafayette, no standing committee exists, but Harris says
committees are formed “as needed” to review problem situations.

Bush hopes for
diplomatic fix
for Middle East

President Bush spoke to the
United Nations General Assembly
Monday and stated that he was
hopeful that a diplomatic solution
could end the tensions in the Per-
sian Gulf.

While he said “the annexa-
tion of Kuwait will not be permit-
ted to stand,” Bush said that “there
may be opportunities for Iraq and
Kuwait to settle their differences
permanently.”

A senior Bush administration
official said that the president was
trying “to remind people that the
diplomatic option is still our pre-
ferred option.”

Chinese plane
crash kills 120

A hijacked Chinese airliner
crashed into two jets at the airport
in Canton, killing at least 120 peo-
ple and engulfing the aircraft in
flames.

The flight was hijacked on its
way to Canton from Xiamen by
two men demanding to be taken to
Taiwan or Hong Kong. It is unclear
why their demands were rejected or
whether this led to the crash.

The crash was the worst air

disaster ever in China. Prime Min-
ister Li Peng flew immediately to
Canton to view the site.

Germany
becomes one

After forty-five years of divi-
sion, Germany became a reunited
nation Wednesday. A copy of the
Liberty Bell, a gift from the United
States, rang from the Berlin city
hall as the West German flag was
raised over the Reichstag at the
stroke of midnight.

President Richard von Weiz-
sacher stated that “in free determi-
nation, we would like to fulfill Ger-
man unity in freedom. We are
aware of our responsibility for
these tasks before God and people.
We want to serve peace in the
world and a united Europe.”

After the statement, a crowd
of about one million broke into
singing the German national
anthem. The celebrations continued
with ringing churchbells and blar-
ing 0om-pah-pah bands.

US and USSR
work for peace
in Angola

The United States and the
Soviet Union have indicated that
they are willing to police a poten-
tial cease-fire and elections in order
to end the 15-year civil war in
Angola.

The superpowers have a
strong influence over Angola
because of their support for differ-
ent factions. Moscow gives $800
million annually in military aid and
stations 1,100 advisers in the Afri-
can nation. The United States pro-
vides $60 million in covert aid to
the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).

Despite a withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops in the last two
years, fighting drags on. Officials
fear a famine in the next six months
if peace is not reached.

Exxon files
claims on Alas-
kan oil spill

The Exxon Corporation filed
claims against the federal govern-
ment for the costs of the Exxon Val-
dez oil spill, saying that the Coast
Guard was responsible for the envi-
ronmental disaster.

The claims, filed with the
Coast Guard, are not a lawsuit, but
indicate that Exxon may eventually
sue the government.

The request was made under
Coast Guard regulations permitting
people or corporations to be reim-
bursed for damages caused by the
Coast Guard’s activities. A com-
pany spokesman said the claim “is
an administrative requirement
under the law, in order to preserve
future legal options with regard to

any potential litigation involving
the federal government.”

President
speaks on bud-
get agreement

President Bush went on tele-
vision Tuesday to explain and gain
support for the budget agreement
worked out between the White
House and Congress.

The President claimed that
the bipartisan package had to be
passed or the country faced a reces-
sion. The package calls for tax
increases on gasoline, alcohol, and
tobacco along with cuts in Medi-
care and other social spending.

Congressional Democrats
want the plan to be passed with
Republican and Democratic votes.

Conservative Republicans, how-
ever, are criticizing the program
and threaten to vote against it.

Souter voted
onto Court

The Senate voted 90 to 9
Tuesday to confirm Judge David
Souter as the Supreme Court’s
105th justice.

In nearly four hours of
speeches on the Senate floor before
the vote, supporters of Judge Souter
claimed that he would preserve fun-
damental constitutional values,
while opponents charged that not
enough was known about his posi-
tions on critical issues.

Chief Justice Renquist will
swear in Judge Souter Tuesday
morning, in time to hear arguments
later that day in the Supreme Court.

an anti-Semitic passage from Adolf
Hitler’s Mein Kampf.

In its official credo under the
masthead, the paper printed the fol-
lowing quote: “I believe today that
I am acting in the sense of the
Almighty Creator. By warding off
the Jews, I am fighting for the
Lord’s work.”

The editors of the Review
issued an apology Monday saying
that the passage had been “slipped
in” without their knowledge into
the paper’s credo.

The Review , whose views
on homosexuals, blacks, and
women have rocked the campus
since the paper’s founding a decade

Accountability

From page 1

Although this leaves security virtu-
ally unregulated when it comes to
public areas, it also leaves what
constitutes “reasonable cause” open
to interpretation.

Ed Dadez, associate dean of
residential life, has come up with
the most comprehensive written def-
inition of reasonable cause in a let-
ter to the editor, March 3, 1989,
The Bucknellian. In the final anal-
ysis Dadez conceded that reasonable
cause “is a judgement call which the
RA is authorized to make as long as
it is \ by factual information under
the guidance of the professional
staff.”

Dadez attempted to clarify the
definition with some examples: “‘1)
people getting sick in the hallway,
2) beer cans or plastic cups in the
hallway, 3) spilled alcohol on the
carpeting, 4) people staggering out
of rooms, 5) sounds of drinking
games, 6) large numbers of people
coming and going out of a room,
and 7) loud music.”

But even these are not strin-
gent guidelines as Dadez conceded,
“Any one of these items may be
enough to believe that a violation is
occurring; however, we believe that
the RA will use common sense and
prudent judgement...” Dadez noted

that in some cases it might take as |
many as four of these factors to |

constitute reasonable cause.
More — importantly,
explained that although this defini-

tion applied to members of the res- |

idential life staff, he was not sure
that security followed the same
procedures.

When asked if there was a
clear definition of reasonable cause,
Maxwell, who is in charge of
administrative supervision of secur-
ity explained that “the university to
my knowledge does not have that
term defined. Whether that’s a term
that’s defined within the legal pro-
fession I don’t know.”

In fact, there is no such defi-
nition within the law; the legal
term is “probable cause.” Lewisburg
District Attorney Graham Showalter
explained that “probable cause has
to do with the minimum degree of
evidence sufficient to show the
defendant has committed a crime.”
The criteron for making a search is
probable cause which was opera-
tionally defined by Showalter as
“knowledge as to specific evidence
in a specific location.”

Maxwell acknowledged that
security does not have to follow
such stringent guidelines, and that,
as with residential life, “I suspect it
comes down to a judgement call.”

Therefore, it appears that
security has no formal restrictions,
though according to Charlotte
Jacobsen Weddle, vice president of
student life, there is a process to
redress grievances against security.
Initially, complaints are to be filed
with the Director of Security and
Safety, and then to Maxwell if the
problem is not solved.

Dominguez explained that
students do not see this as a legiti-
mate process. “Without a set of pro-
cedures with something in writing,
I don’t believe that students would
be confident that their concern
would be addressed if it was handled
with a meeting with the director of
security.”

As an_ intermediate step
between the director and Maxwell,
the Committee on Complementary
Activities (CCA) could become
involved. But as Rick Gateau ‘92
explained, “In the past we’ve gone
to the department head at the end of
the semester to receive his report.”

Gateau did express interest in
increased relations with security
including “one member who will be
assigned as a liaison to security...”
But on the whole, CCA is con-
strained by what “President Sojka
gives us to look at - for example,
vandalism.” Though Gateau said he
did not wish to “pinpoint one
issue,” he does want to look into
“more coordination between residen-
tial life and security.”

As of yet, CCA is not pre-
pared to oversee security and adjudi-
cate grievances.

Addressing complaints to
Maxwell seems inadequate as well
since, according to Maxwell, “The
director of security reports to me.
But the director provides all the

guidance, direction, and first line
supervision.” Maxwell’s rigorous
job duties demand that he be some-
what removed in his supervision of
security.

Thus, the dilemma remains.
Security has no written procedural
limitations concerning their con-
duct in public areas, and the “rea-
sonable cause” prohibition in pri-
vate areas has never been formally

The

defined and is in Maxwell’s words,
“a judgement call.” Administra-
tively, students are not aware of
their options; these options,
though, appear to be limited as
well; students do not have confi-
dence in addressing problems to the
Director of Security, CCA is not
prepared to handle complaints, and
Maxwell simply cannot provide
“first line supervision” of security.

A lot of campus rapes start here.

Whenever there’s drinking or drugs, things can get out of hand.
So its no surprise that many campus rapes involve alcohol.

But you should know that under any circumstances, sex without
the other person's consent is considered rape. A felony, punishable
by prison. And drinking is no excuse.
Thats why, when you party, it's good to know what your limits are.
You see, 4 little sobering thought now can save you from a big
problem later.

Local bed and breakfast
blends hospitality with history

By Claire Davidson

During the early days of
America, the pineapple, that sweet,
prickly covered fruit that is so com-
mon to us today, was a rare food
and hardly found in the home. If
your host offered you a pineapple
the offer let you know you were a
very special guest and were wel-
come in their home. The pineapple
therefore became known as a genu-
ine symbol of hospitality, as a way
of saying “you are welcome here.”

Charlie North, the innkeeper
of the Pineapple Inn which is
located in downtown Lewisburg
commented on why he chose this
particular name for his business.
“We want to try and make the
name come out in what we do. It
becomes more personal which is
how it should be,” he explained.

Charlie North and his wife, Debo-
rah, both agree that the special
aspect of a bed and breakfast com-
pared to a large hotel is that you are
able to establish a close relation-
ship with your guests.

The North’s decision to open
up this type of business was made
mainly because they wanted to
create an environment for their
children where both parents would
be around all the time. “Our chil-
dren always have a mother and a
father. It was the best thing for our
family,” commented Deborah
North. “I wouldn’t do anything
else. I opted to raise a family and I
haven’t regretted it at all,” added
Charlie North.

Charlie North, who received
a bachelor of arts from the Univer-
sity of Florida in hotel/restaurant
administration previously worked

for the Washington Hilton as the
director of convention services, a
very high-pressure job with unusual
hours, according to both Charlie
and Deborah North. Charlie’s job
was to set up the physical aspects
of the conventions that were held at
the hotel, so he was ultimately
blamed if anything went wrong.

In November of 1983 they
moved to Danville, where Charlie
North worked as the initial consul-
tant at the Inn at Turkey Hill in
nearby Bloomsburg. In order to get
a loan from Sedacog, a government
agency that helps small businesses,
the inn had to hire a professional in
the field of hotel management:
Charlie was their man. However,
when he finished his work there,
his family had to decide whether
they would return to Washington,
back to the stressful job he previ-

ously had, or look for an alternative
solution.

The Norths felt very comfort-
able in the Lewisburg area, having
lived in Danville, and liked the peo-
ple in this area, so they decided that
for the benefit of their family they
would start to look for places to
open a bed and breakfast. Through
their realtor they found the building
which is now known as the Pineap-
ple Inn.

The building was originally
constructed in 1867 by Louis
Palmer, who was also the original
architect for Roberts Hall. It is a
federal style house built in the Vic-
torian era, reflecting the character-
istics of a federal revival home in
the mid-nineteenth century. On
March 1, 1985, Charlie and Debo-
rah North opened their doors and
since then the inn has become a
very popular place for parents of
Bucknell students to stay.

The North’s next task was to
find furnishings for the inn. A few
days after they bought the house,
Charlie North was browsing in a
local antique shop for various
pieces of furniture. The owner of
the store, an eccentric old man,
took an interest in the newly
formed bed and breakfast. Later
that week the man visited the house
and made the Norths a proposition.
He would provide all the furnish-
ings for the upstairs and downstairs

and whatever he furnished would
be put on sale. The Norths sold
almost all of the furniture provided
by the man. Soon after, however,
the old man passed away and in his
will he stated that the North’s were
able to buy all the furnishings from
his estate. This is ultimately from
whence their furnishings came.
This once old, unlived-in house
became an elegant, cozy bed and
breakfast where people visiting the
area could stay.

Student Profile

Russian exchange student
enjoys studies in U. S.

By Susan Elolampi

This year, Bucknell wel-
comes Pavel Usikov, its first
exchange student from the Soviet
Union. Pavel was born in East Ger-
many and now lives in a flat in Bal-
ashikha, a small industrial town on
the outskirts of Moscow. He lives
with his father who is a senior offi-
cer in the Red Army, his mother,
and his older brother and is the first
member of his family to come to
the United States.

Pavel has come to Bucknell
for one year to study economics, or
more specifically, the U.S. eco-
nomic system. Like many other
Soviet students, Pavel feels that the
model of the Soviet economy
doesn’t work and is in turn looking
for different ways to reform the
Soviet system. In economic terms,
the Soviet labor force is cheap,
where one must work one day to
earn the money for a pack of cigar-
ettes or three days to earn the
money for a meal at McDonald’s.
Fortunately for Soviet students,
they don’t have to pay to continue
their education as American stu-
dents do.

Pavel attends the Moscow
Plekhanov Institute of Economics.
He has studied English for about
three years as well as German. As
he explains, until recently, the
Soviet Union has been a “locked
country” where people have had no
use for foreign languages. Now the
Soviet Union is being integrated
into the world and students are
eager to study different languages
and cultures.

PEACHB

“The U.S. educational system
is very flexible compared to that of
the Soviet Union,” explains Pavel..
For example, here at Bucknell, one
may take a wide variety of courses
outside of his major but in the
Soviet Union, one may only take
the courses which fall within the
major. Pavel is also amazed with
the amount of writing American
students do and would recommend
this to improve the Soviet educa-
tional system. The reading assign-
ments are much larger here too.
Soviet students take notes at lec-
tures and only read their textbooks
at the end of the semester when
they borrow them to prepare for
exams. Yet, one fault Pavel sees
with the U.S. system is the lack of
time to ask questions in class about
the reading assignments, but notes
that the willingness and availability
of professors to meet with students
outside of class provides extra help.

Surprising to Pavel is the
warm reception he has received in
the U.S. In the Soviet Union, for-
eigners are perceived almost as
“aliens.” For example, an “Ameri-
can” is simply a label representing
“flourishing, rich, someone that
May give a souvenir.” American
cigarettes are popular and expen-
sive because they hold the “Ameri-
can” label. He makes the analogy
that the U.S. is like a color televi-
sion with many different colors and
the Soviets, in black and white,
want the freedoms and benefits too.

Pavel feels that living stan-
dards in the Soviet Union show no
sign of improvement. With all of
the political instability, the barrier

In addition, Charlie North prepares

guests every moming. The menu is
another special characteristic of the
inn. He provides homemade bread
with fresh strawberry jam, farm
eggs any style, Amish bacon,
french toast, freshly pressed apple
cider and orange juice. He also has
a special selection of Walnut Acres
Granolas for those who choose a no

possible,” commented Charlie

Stronger. “The first step,” explains
Pavel, “is Tecognizing the
problem.”

Most striking to Pavel, is the
self-confidence and independence
of Americans. Most Soviets are
inclined to be a part of a group.
Yet, “Americans still have a very
good social life,” comments Pavel.
“There is something for all.”

As Pavel says, he “may be
the first, but not the last Soviet
exchange student. We must all
make a future together, and study
together, not apart.”

Bison

By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

It’s Sunday afternoon, and
I'm in Bertrand Library (where
else?) attempting to decipher the
“key words” that seemed to
make perfect sense when I jotted
them down as notes during lec-
tures this week; there’s some-
thing about taking notes that
really scares me. However, I
don’t have too much time to
think about that right now, in
fact, I can barely concentrate on
my work because of this idiot
next to me who keeps on sniffing
every 3 seconds. You know his
type: he plops his books down
really hard on the desk, takes a
full seven minutes to crinkle
papers and open and close his
binder rings, then, when you
finally think he has settled down
to quitely do his work, he lets out
a serious of sporadic sniffs so
obnoxiously loud, that you can
vividly picture the mucus being
sucked up his nasal passage into
his brain where it proceeds to
harden, thus destroying any cere-
bral capacity for intelligent
thought or politeness.

A few years ago, I had the
incredible luck. of taking the
SAT’s with not one, but THREE
sniffers. As the test progressed
and the barrage of stereo snot

sucking continued, I wrestled
with an uncontrollable urge to
throw down my “Reading Com-
prehension” section and blud-
geon the inconsiderate hypo-
chondriacs with my number two
pencil. Today, I think a better
alternative would be to move up
to the top level (cutthroat sec-
un) of the library and leave Mr.

Deviated-Septum alone to relish

in his phlegm.

So I hide my three cans of
contraband soda in my backpack
and climb the five winding car-
peted flights, settling down at a
carrell next to a girl who looks
vaguely familiar. That's right,
she was in one of my classes last
year and we talked at a party.
Considering it was pretty
crowded and the music was kind
of loud, our conversation wasn’t
too bad, it went something like
this...

Me: (spotting girl) Hi!

Girl: (trying to block out “Jungle
Love” being played at 425
decibels) WHAT?!?

Me: Hi, i’m in your Freshman
Seminar... “Medical Appli-
cations of Underwater
Ditch Digging, a Feminist
Perspective.” Remember?
WHAT?!?!!1!

(putting my mouth two

inches from her ear and

Girl: Oh yeah!
Me: WHAT?!?
After that sparkling repar-

Tales

tee, I decided to take my room-
mate (who had discovered that
funnelling gin after eating caf
stromboli can lead to slight pangs
of gastric distress) home. He
spent the rest of the evening
flinging things around the room
and puking into an orange juice
container. I could have accepted
this tantrum except for the fact
that he inadvertently tore up my
history notes and flushed them
down the toilet.

Actually, I guess that
wasn’t too big a deal because my
notes weren’t very good anyway.
I can never understand those peo-
ple who sit in the front row
hunched over their perfectly
organized binders and hold their
multi-colored clicky pens less
than two inches from the paper in
an effort to document every sin-
gle action occurring in class that
could, in some remote way, effect
their test grade. These people are
the ones who begin writing and
flipping pages frantically, before
anyone has actually entered the
classroom.

I have in the past made an
effort to make my notes more
extensive, but some factor always
seems to prevent me from doing
it. Last year, I had one English
professor who’s chalkboard legi-
bility skills indicated a failure to
complete “Prescription Writing
101.” He also enjoyed emphasiz-
ing facts by pressing extra hard
with the chalk, which would then
make a neat noise while it split in
two and went flying into the front
row (hitting the kid with the
multi-colored clicky pen).

I was excited when I dis-
covered that my Geology
Prof. had slightly better handwrit-
ing. . . except he talked really fast
and made absolutely no sense. A
typical lecture usually sounded
something like this: Okay, Now
thisisa Sedimentarystone andthis-
isa Metamorphicstone andthisisa

and your boyfriend answers the
phone. What do you tell her?
Explain that:

-it was the pizza delivery
man from the 24-hour place

-your voice always sounds
hoarse in the moming

—it was your hallmate, she’s
been taking steroids

-it was the
machine

—you deliberately answer in a
low voice to deter obscene callers

-someone from upstairs was
in to borrow a cup of milk

answering

1B. (Males) Ditto and your
girlfriend answers. Explain that:

—you were practicing to be a
Michael Jackson impersonator

—you had just sucked down a
serious amount of helium

-you are finally hitting
puberty and your voice cracked

-the school nurse is there to
administer Sudafed

—you host regular coed dawn
Study sessions

2. The Unwanted Visitor. As
you see him/her coming toward
your room:

—quickly grab the phone and
pretend you’re having a serious
conversation

-shut off your lights and
stereo so there’s no sign of life

feign nausea and run for the
bathroom, stay there

—put the stereo on volume 10
and lock your door

When the football team from
Lafayette challenged our boys to a
game in 1883, they could hardly
decline. Without a team and with-
out a field, these young men orga-
nized what was later to become a
major part of Bucknell’s sports pro-
gram. Lacking a coach, they
leaned the rules of the game
through books and trained the
twelve man team (eleven players
and one substitute) in two weeks.
On Thanksgiving Day, 1883, our
boys and Lafayette’s played the
first football game in Bucknell his-
tory. There were no school colors,
no cheerleaders, no band and no
grandstand. There weren’t even
that many spectators. There was,
however, the Bucknell spirit and
the desire to prove that we could do
whatever we set our minds to. By
the way, we lost (59-0).

Four years later, a committee
was delegated to decide upon
Bucknell’s school colors. The com-
mittee members, Dr. William V.
Hayes ‘88, Harry Kelly ‘88, and
John Minnick ‘88, met in October,
1887 in the apartment of Mrs. Wil-
liam E. Martin. On the back of one
of Mrs. Martin’s chairs was a silk
ribbon. It was blue and orange. The

committee quickly took a liking to
this color and decided that they
would present these as Bucknell’s
official school colors.

By the early 1900's Bucknell
was rapidly expanding and_ its
sports program was in full swing.
As with every school, Bucknell
needed a mascot. Dr. William C.
Bartol thought it appropriate to
have a bison, since Bucknell is
located in Buffalo Valley and is
close to Buffalo Creek, Buffalo Mt.
Little Buffalo Creek, and Buffalo
Cross Roads, all named after the
herds that once roamed the area. In
1923 the bison was adopted as the
official mascot, and in October,
1940 a real baby bison was pre-
sented to the booster club for the
centennial homecoming game
against, ironically enough, Lafay-
ette. The baby bison died the fol-
lowing May, and the Bucky Bison
we know today soon followed.

Certainly those early pioneers
never dreamed of Bucknell as it is
today, but they were instrumental
in starting something that is an
important part of Bucknell’s his-
tory. From that first dirt field to
Matthewson stadium...you’ve come
a long way, baby.

Stein Haus

323 Market St., Sunbury
286-1261

Open daily for lunch and dinner

Welcome to “Wine, Dine and well...never mind,” a critical look
at some of the better (we hope) dining establishments in the greater
Lewisburg metropolitan area.

Steve and Julie are in search of “the alternative”...a place to dine
when you’ ve already experienced every entree at Rusty’s, Scarlet D’s
and Front Street Station.

The Stein Haus, located on Market St. in Sunbury, can be one of
those alternatives, if you stay away from some of the seafood dishes.

The atmosphere is rather geriatric, full of older people and deco-
rated with an extensive latticework. Although relaxing, the atmos-
phere was a bit too subdued,

One of the bonuses of the evening was pianist Glenn Grove,
who tickled the ivories for our dining and cocktail lounge entertain-
ment. Saturday nights feature Glenn from 7 to 10 p.m.

Julie sampled the Chicken Oriental ($8.95), a dish chock full of
Juicy chicken medallions and stir fried veggies served up on a bed of
rice. The portion was simply amazing — too much for Julie to handle
on her own. Julie complemented her Chicken Oriental with the soup,
salad and bread bar ($1.50), which she found to be average. The Ched-
dar Cheese soup was tasty, but the salad and bread segments of the bar
were limited.

Steve dined on what he thought would be a tasty seafood treat
— barbecued shrimp served on linguini, The shrimp itself was not
barbecued, but drenched in a light barbecue sauce. Steve was rather
disappointed and surprised, for he had never encountered this method
of preparing barbecued shrimp.

Steve also went for the soup, salad and bread bar, which he
found to be a nice complement to his meal. Even though Stein Haus’
bar is not as extensive or appetizing as Hoss,’ it did the trick,

Stein Haus offers an extensive menu — from lobstertail ($15) to
tenderloin tips burgundy ($11). Stein Haus’ offers a wide range of
entrees that will satisfy the most finicky restaurant patron.

Stein Haus is open for both lunch and dinner seven days a week.
Julie and Steve give Stein Haus three bison and say check it out!

Not so reasonable

Remember guidelines? Yes, the very same things that students are given every time alcohol
sanctions are changed, and the things that seem to appear on every other page of the Student

Handbook.

Did anyone ever bother to think of establishing guidelines for the Office of Security and _
Safety? The answer lies in the catchword “reasonable cause” and in the office of Vice Presi-
dent for Administration, Barry Maxwell.

The Community Living Handbook contains the only written restriction on Security, when it

comes to breaching students’ rights of privacy, when it says that the Office of Security and _
Safety along with Residential Life can only enter private areas of residence halls and fraternity
houses if they establish “reasonable cause.”

The question, then, is just what is “reasonable cause’”?

i is or her hands on
After a hearty search through all of the materials that a student can get his or on
there seems to be no printed definition of “reasonable cause.” In fact, Barry Maxwell said this
week that “the University, to my knowledge, does not have that term defined.

Meanwhile, Ed Dadez, associate dean of residential life, prefers to refer to a letter to the editor
printed in the March 3, 1989 edition of The Bucknellian as the source for the definition of

“reasonable cause.”

The Administration seems to have come up with this nebulous term on its own and to suit its
own purposes. According to “frame of reference” schools in the Commonwealth of Pennsylva-
nia, all university security departments strictly abide by the /egally defined term “probable
cause.” Some even mocked the idea that Bucknell’s Office of Security and Safety can enter
private rooms without any form of warrant.

Just where do we stand? With no clear, or even publicly printed, definition of “reasonable
cause” how is anyone to know within what bounds the University and it agents can act?

In order for students to be expected to obey the laws, the laws, and the definitions of terms
used to enforce those laws, must be public knowledge. Likewise, if Security’s enforcement of
University policy is expected to be uniform, specific guidelines must be set forth for Security

to follow.

When is comes to the oversight of Security and Safety, it is Barry Maxwell who holds ultimate
authority. Maxwell is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the actions of Security and
Safety and, ostensibly, ensuring that Security does not overstep its bounds while it fulfills its
role of providing for the security and safety of the University community.

In the case of oversight, however, practice and written policy are painfully divergent.
Maxwell clearly does not have the time, given all of his other duties, to adequately oversee the
day-to-day operations of Security. Yet, there is an obvious need for an oversight body.

A committee comprised of students, faculty, administrators and the Director of Security and
Safety must be established to formulate the fundamental guidelines necessary for the ethical

operation of Security.

It is time that Bucknell took another look at the Office of Security and Safety and, more :
importantly, the lack of guidelines that have been set forth for them to follow. How about it?

January term allows for learning without formality

By Michael McGandy

Last week’s editorial in the
Bucknellian titled “It ain’t broke;
don’t fix it” concluded with the
query, “What then is the issue?”
The topic, of course, was the pro-
posed changes in our January pro-
gram suggested by the Committee
on Instruction, chaired by Andrea
Halpern. In this column I would
like to add to this discussion and
clarify just in what sense the Janu-
ary term is “broke” as the COI and
others believe.

The January term, as it stands
presently with only a 35% partici-
pation rate, is simply not efficient.
Students are not on campus or, if
they are, are just not participating
in the program; they are doing
they’re own thing, so to speak. A
month passes without the Univer-
sity knowing where those students
were—if they were building their
minds or destroying them—since
none of their activity was accred-
ited. A whole month of a student’s
life cannot be accounted for in the
Registrar’s files.

A disturbing predicament,
you say. Well just think of the
faculty loitering about without a
class full of disinterested students
to lecture at. Though the publishing
ante was raised a couple years
back, these academicians still seem
to find time to behave in all sorts of
unpredictable and, again, unaccred-
ited ways. What better way to
ensure that a delinquent faculty,
many of whom have slid back into
bad habits after being tenured,
remains in harness?

This has all been a bit sarcas-
tic, but I believe the picture it sug-
gests is accurate. For the issue that
the Bucknellian editorial could not
identify is indeed efficiency and
accountability. The whole tenor of
the proposed changes to January
program reeks of a concern for effi-
ciency, or making sure that the path

of prosperity and proper time man-
agement is chosen. In many ways
the COI is giving some strong mar-
keting advice to those unable to
effectively package and market
themselves.

What I mean by _ these
remarks, if most students have not
caught on yet, is this: the signs of
success and ability are found on
paper, in how you document your
activities. Seniors who are begin-
ning to consider interviewing and
have typed up their first resume
have gotten a taste of this and cer-
tainly will learn in their first inter-
view. At our age and in our posi-
tion—that is, without permanent
and successful employment—we
must be striving, we must be seek-
ing to better ourselves, and we

script. This has nothing intrinsi-
cally to do with education, but a
great deal to do with accountability.
Obviously, to the parent, “educat-
ing” is taking place during the
autumn and spring terms because
all of these criteria are present. At
the very least it appears as if there
is education taking place, and per-
haps that is all that matters. It is
certainly all that matters in terms of
appealing to the job market, and
that is something most parents are
quite concerned about.

It is my hope that the faculty
will resist equating structure with
learning and admit that credits,
classes, and “physical results” do
not necessarily mean that anyone is
leaming—student or professor.
This will require some bravery

Simply, it seems to me that the January
term as it stands now is an ideal time for
students to take a few chances ...

rr

must be writing it down all the
while. Remember, if it can’t be
documented it does not mean
much.

The COI wants students to be
participating in a January program
at least two years of the four spent
here as an undergraduate. These
classes or projects must yield a
“phiysical result;” that is, there must
be evidence of your time spent on
campus. Further, the January term
will be shortened to three weeks to
ensure that students can get those
“good” jobs, those “resume build-
ers” I have heard so much about.

Hundreds of parents are said
to have complained that, in effect,
the January program as it stands
now does not seem purposeful. But
let us be honest—what does “pur-
Pposeful” mean to a parent, most
parents? Rules, strictures, “physical
results,” and a mark on the tran-

since it suggests that, for all the for-
mality—rules and results—of the
autumn and spring terms, there is
the possibility that there are stu-
dents who are not being educated. I
believe that anyone who has spent
some time in the academy will have
to admit that this is, sadly, the case.

Now, I do not wish to be mis-
taken as someone who finds no
value in traditional forms of educa-
tion or, worse yet, a Bucknell edu-
cation. On the whole our present
system, more consistently than any
other I can think of, provides ample
Opportunity and resources for
Meaningful intellectual activity to
occur. Simply, it seems to me that
the January term as it stands now is
an ideal time for students to take a
few chances and search out just
what they find to be meaningful.
For eight months of the year stu-
dents search for meaning within the

formal academic context; and a
month of independent pursuit (with
the provision that the University’s
resources are there if desired) con-
tinues to be a valuable institution.

If I might engage in a bit of
pop-psychology, it has often
occurred to me that the generation I
am a part of fears to make mis-
takes. Now, if I judge the senti-
ments of those hundreds of parents
and the COI correctly, it appears
that our parents and university fear
our mistakes as well—the mistakes
reflect badly on them. Rules must
be made such that students cannot
“waste” their January. But I would
hold that it is more valuable to
allow for mistakes to be made, than
to curtail the range of choices that
face students in order to prevent
mistakes. Further I would challenge
the notion that these unaccounted
Januaries are actually without pur-
pose or wasteful; or at least I would
put forward the possibility that
required and accredited Januaries
might be just as wasteful if our cri-
terion is learning and _ not
documentation.

Finally, these requirements
proposed by the COI are antitheti-
cal to the spirit in which the Janu-
ary term was created. While not
wishing to romanticize 60’s cul-
ture, the climate at that time did
seem to promote a valuing of learn-
ing for its own sake. In this spirit
the January term was created to
allow for creativity, for possibility,
while fully recognizing that these
valuable things necessarily began
within a realm of choice and free-
dom. What is creative in fulfilling a
requirement? What is the energy
invested and the value derived?
Ask the professors who teach
courses that serve as lah require-
ments, that teach many of Buck-
nell’s “intro” courses—the answer
is the following:

The passion to provide the
documentation, accountability, and

efficiency that our would-be sui-
tors—employers and _— graduate
schools—require should not make
us forget why the January term was
instituted and delude us as to what
these requirements will actually
achieve. We should be working to
revive a climate that will encourage
Students to spend their Januaries at

Bucknell, in Lewisburg. I, too,
would like to see more folks—
students and professors—around in
January. Yet to institute these
requirements would be to approach
the whole situation in a backward
manner and choose—as is too often
the case at Bucknell—form over
substance.

Freshman Forum

By Richard Polt

Recently, I have noticed a lot of admissions tour groups wander-
ing around the campus. They stroll by me on the Quad next to Cole-
man and they overrun me at the bookstore in the U.C. As I pass these
high school students beginning their quest for higher education, | am
overwhelmed with a sense of pity. They are entering what could be the
most confusing, tedious and hellish period of their lives. My intentions
are not to dissuade any youngsters from taking this necessary and criti-
cal step. I simply want to share some of my college entrance stories in
the hopes that fellow Bucknellians can relate.

I vividly remember sitting in Freas Hall last year, clueless, wait-
ing for my tour of Bucknell to begin. Coming from a graduating class
of 62, I was awed by the people, buildings and way of life to which I
was so foreign. I recall how embarrassing it was when the tour walked
into some guy’s dorm room at 8:00 a.m. Sunday morning and my
mother started asking intelligent questions like, “Do you use a bucket
to carry your toiletries to the bathroom or do you just carry them in
your hands?” Toiletry transportation was number 52 on my list of
important things to ask, right below number 51, which was the average

Boxer shorts to ‘Jockeys’ ratio.

Other things perturbed me as well. I’m sure that I wasn’t the
only kid whose father grabbed every piece of literature in sight for me
to read. I expected to get a copy of the “Student Handbook” and a
“Freshman Profile,” not “Bucknell’s Guide to Campus Plumbing: A to

Zz”

There was also a sense of hatred which I felt towards all other
students in the admissions halls or on my tours. I knew they were my
competition, and I wasn’t going to let them show me up, under any cir-
cumstances. Being that I didn’t know who to impress anyway, I proba-
bly appeared a bit foolish when I began listing my avocational inter-

ests to the cafeteria workers,

But now it’s time to stop complaining. The hard work and hours
of research did have a big payoff. As a member of the Bucknell com-
munity, I have begun the next important step in my education. And if
some wide-eyed mother asks me if I have a bucket for my toiletries, I
can proudly say, “Yes! I have a big bucket—a big, black, plastic
bucket with holes in it so the water can drain out!”

‘Little Feat” steps up to the microph

Tonight's concert features Representing the Mambo

By Jon Elliot
Staff Writer

Known as one of the most
underrated American rock and roll
bands with what many call a live
performance surpassed by few, Lit-
Ue Feat will preform tonight at
Davis Gym at 8 p.m. In support of
their most recent release, Repre-
senting the Mambo (Warner
Bros.), Little Feat will light up
Bucknell after a highly successful
solo tour this summer, as well as
opening a number of shows for
Jimmy Buffett.

Little Feat recently regained
national, and international recogni-
tion after their 1988 release, Let It
Roll, which included such hits as
“Cajun Girl,” “One — Clear
Moment,” as well as the title track.
But it was in fact more than twenty
years ago, October, 1969, for that
matter, that, current members Bill
Payne (keyboards, vocals) and
Ritchie Hayward (drums) and ex-
member Roy Estrada came together
under the guidance of ex-Mothers
of Invention member, the late Low-
ell George. Originally named
Country Zeke and the Freaks, a Los
Angeles based psychedelic band,
George soon changed the name to
Little Feat due to his fear that the
group would soon be labeled a
country and western band because
of their original name. After a year
of playing small clubs in southern
California, Little Feat was sur-
prised with a record offer by War-
ner Bros. records. Little Feat, their
debut album, was released in 1971
and included a handful of future
hits, including the original version
of George’s always welcomed
stage performance of “Willin’.”

Although Little Feat had a
hard time reaching an American

audience, their combination of
Cajun, blues, country and rock
gained tremendous popularity in
Europe. It was not until Little
Feat’s second release in 1972, Sai-
lin’ Shoes, that the group secured a
foothold in the American music
scene which was being forged by
such bands as Jefferson Airplane,
the Grateful Dead and The Doors.
This 1972 release included such
Feat hits as “Cold, Cold, Cold” and
“Tripe Face Boogie.” Unpleased by
the progression with the group’s
first two albums, bassist Roy
Estrada left the band to pursue
other interests, and George
recruited Kenney Gradney to
replace Estrada, Paul Barrere on
guitar and vocals and percussionist/
conga player Sam Clayton to give
the band a new six-man sound.

Dixie Chicken, Little Feat’s
first release as the newly formed
sextet, produced what was their
strongest effort to date, with such
hits as “Fat Man In the Bathtub” as
well as the title cut. Yet the group
saw little success and soon after
disbanded. George contributed to
musical efforts by such artists as
Robert Palmer and John Sabastian
until Little Feat once again
regrouped to release Feats Don’t
Fail Me Now in August, 1974.
Oddly enough, this, their first truly
successive album, saw major crea-
tive strides being taken by Payne
on “Oh Atlanta” and Barrere’s tal-
ent on “Skin It Back,” and less of
an emphasis on George’s individual
skill.

Little Feat’s record of succes-
sive annual releases continued in
1975 with The Last Recorded
Album which showed the group’s
continued inner strife. Payne and
Barrere collaborated on a good
number of the tracks, including

Flatliners intrigues

By Lee Guzofski
Staff Writer

Greetings yet again Bucknellians! It is the General once again
bidding you well and wishing to offer any “insight” that I may (or may
not) have regarding the world of cinema. Well, now that that crap is
out of the way... this week I was able to see Flatliners Starring Keifer
Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and Julia Roberts as brilliant, if not a tad bit
deranged, med school students. Sutherland stars as the ingenius young
doctor Nelson who comes up with the revolutionary idea of travelling
beyond the veil of death to unlock the secrets therein. Although he’s
extremely intelligent, he is a few sandwiches short of a picnic...

The film is a post mortem parade through the religious and
philosophical theories regarding death. Deep stuff. As Nelson says
when asked why he wants to do this, “Religion’s failed, philosophy’s
failed, it’s up to physical science.” His experiment is, in a manner of
speaking, a success. HOWEVER, each person brings back with them,
upon revival, their sins or guilt in a physical form. Nelson says,
“Somehow we brought our sins back with us, and they’re pissed.”

This film was, in short, incredible. As long as one suspends
disbelief for the majority of the movie, it is a stunningly well-done vis-
ual masterpiece which has, as another strength, myriad subtle nuances.
For instance, when Julia Roberts is revived there is, scrawled on the
bathroom wall the famous quote from Friedrich Neitzsche, “God is
dead.” Most impressively, the film closes with a painting of Prome-
theus, the mythic mortal who stole fire from the gods and gave this for-
bidden knowledge to man. An excellent closing statement to a movie
that was largely concerned with Nelson seeking fame and fortune.

In my estimation, this film was the summer’s best. It was as
fresh and as brilliant as a big, old lime green jello mold that your mom
just made and put in the fridge. Just the thing to cure the summer dol-
drums. I highly recommend it: (the movie, not my mom’s jell-o...)

“All That You Dream.” It wasn’t
until two years later, 1977, that the
group finished their sixth album in
seven years, Time Loves A Hero
was not as critically well received
in America as it was abroad and did
not add much stability to the
group’s continued turmoil.

It is at this point in Little
Feat’s history that the group real-
ized that their strength rested in the
energy of their live performances.
What the band decided to try was
recording two live concerts, in Lon-
don and Maryland, and combine
the two in their 1978 release of
Waiting for Columbus, which
ultimately became the group’s only
gold album.

After producing the Grateful
Dead’s Shakedown Street in 1978,
George began working on his first
solo project, thus creating what
many saw as the end of the Feat.
Thanks, ll Eat It Here was
released in March of 1979, and a
short three months later, Lowell
George was found dead of an “acci-
dental drug overdose” at the age of
34. Although George devoted some
time prior to his death to a future
Little Feat album, he died before
the band could complete their work
in the studio. Released in Novem-
ber, 1979, Down on the Farm was
completed by Payne and Barrere,
with George’s vocals having been
recorded prior to his death. Upon
it’s release, Little Feat decided to
call it quits, which proved, aside
from a Payne supervised compila-
tion of Little Feat practice tracks
and demos entitled Hoy Hoy, that
Little Feat was no more.

It was not until 1988, what
amounted to nine years after the
group’s break-up, that Little Feat

Shakespeare

By Jill Myrom

How would Shakespeare
react if he knew that his comedy,
The Two Gentlemen of Verona,
had been adapted to fit the back-
drop of the age of American Wild
West? Incredible as it sounds, The
Acting Company of Washington,
D.C. has indeed _ significantly
altered the setting, costumes, and
hair styles in Shakespeare’s play,
for the benefit of the “modern”
audience.

Their version of the play,
enacted last Friday night as a part
of the Weis Center Arts Series, was
filled with anachronisms that did
not allow the audience to imagine it
has been romantically transported
back to the 16th century for three
hours. Instead, we were bombarded
by references to twentieth century
images, such as the cowboys and
Indians backdrop, which provided
the setting for a great portion of the
comedy. An oversized cactus domi-
nated one side of the stage, while a
saloon-style doorway stood
propped arbitrarily on the other,
details which necessarily conflicted
with the constant verbal references
to Verona and Millen (Milan).

The storyline itself rang a
bell even for those who had not
seen or read Two Gentlemen
before, perhaps because the themes
of the play were neither new or
unique to this comedy. The major

elements of the play included the
betrayal of a friend in order to win
a beautiful woman’s hand, the
betrayal of one’s true and faithful
love, the self-centered father who
creates conflicts to keep the lovers
from marrying, and of course, the
happy resolution which leads to a
double wedding, the trademark of
many Shakespearean comedies.
This play has been termed a
“minor” comedy of Shakespeare’s
by Benét’s Reader’s Encyclopedia
of Literature, perhaps due to the
common nature of the plot.

The Acting Company, how-
ever, tumed this “minor” plot into a
major success, judging from the
audience’s frequent outbursts of
laughter. The humor of the script
was indeed at the forefront of the
acting; the actor’s interpretation of
the play showed sensitivity to the
nuances of Elizabethan humor.

The comedy of the play was
derived primarily from the many
clown characters. While the clowns
held relatively minor roles in the
plot, they nevertheless were the
ones who prompted the main char-
acters into action.

The presence of the clowns,
who dressed in baggy polka-dotted
Suits, Oversized plastic shoes, rode
scooters and often fell with a crash
off either side of the stage,
reminded the audience of two
things: that despite the moanings of

the lovestruck gentlemen, the play
was a comedy, not a tragedy, and
secondly that this was not a tradi-
tional rendition of the script.

The costumes of the clowns
were contemporary portrayals of
clowns, rather than Elizabethan
Fools. Speed, the head clown, so to
speak, introduced the most anach-
ronisms of all the others in the play,
by whistling the theme to Gilli-
gan’s Island, as well as the theme
to the game show Jeopardy. Speed
also recited a clip of his verse in
Tap, caricaturing Black diction and
mimicking the scraping of records
against needles. This was one of
the few scenes of the play which I
found to be potentially offensive.
Like David Letterman, Speed made
fun of everyone, but I nevertheless
was not convinced that a white
actor attempting to do Shakespeare
in rap was necessary to the progres-
sion of the play, since it was obvi-
ously a construct of the director,
not of Shakespeare.

On the whole, the play was
lighthearted and well-conceived.
The audience responded with
enthusiasm, although the couple sit-
ting next to me did leave at inter-
Mission, never to return. The play
managed to extract itself from the
16th century, creating a “timeless
niche,” says Chris Bittenbender, a
member of last Friday’s audience.

Jonathon Wise/The Bucknellian

Lady Bison defender Katrina Mueller ’93 stretches out for a loose ball during Bucknell’s last home game
against Colgate Sept. 27. The field hockey team is continuing to search for the right offensive formula, as
goals this season have come at a premium for the Lady Bison.

By Scooter Van Kirk and
Julie McCausland
Staff Writers

Defense is an extremely
important part of team sports, and

the Bucknell field hockey team has
shown that it is more than capable
of showcasing excellent defensive
play. But offense is equally neces-
sary and Lady Bison have yet to
find sustained attacks. In addition

to not scoring many goals in nine
games this season, Bucknell simply
can’t muster the offensive drives
which consistently result in scoring
opportunities.

Last Saturday the Lady Bison

Water polo sweeps
Villanova Tourney

By Scott Pollins
Staff Writer

Last weekend, Bucknell’s
water polo team traveled to Villa-
nova last weekend for an eight-
team tournament featuring strong
eastern squads. The Bison finished
first, going undefeated in four
games. Host team Villanova fin-
ished second, George Washington
placed third, and Johns Hopkins
took fourth.

Bucknell’s first game was
against Johns Hopkins. The Bison
jumped out to a commanding 11-2
lead and cruised to a 14-5 victory.
Kevin Schroth “92 and Danny
Brown ‘93 led the Bison surge by
scoring 3 goals each in the first
quarter.

Dan Killinger ‘92 and Walter
Kelly ‘92 individually added two
goals as well. John Bradbury ‘92
played a tremendous game in goal,
compiling 12 saves. In an effort to
give all her players ample playing
time, Coach Lynn Kachmarick

played her starting groups for the
first half of the games, while she
played her younger and inexperi-
enced players the second half.

The Bison next faced Cor-
nell. Bucknell clearly outplayed the
Big Red, winning 11-2. The Bison
jumped to an 8-0 halftime bulge
and never looked back.

A.J. Zottola ‘92, Schroth, and
Kelly led a balanced Bison attack
in which seven players scored. John
Bradbury turned in another fine
game in goal, registering nine
Saves.

After winning the first two
games with relative ease, the Bison
continued their excellent play by
crushing George Washington 16-7.
Bucknell stormed to an 11-2 half-
time lead. Brown led Bucknell with
4 goals. Tim Smaldone ‘Gr and
Zottola added 2 goals each. Win-
ning this game qualified the Bison
for the championship game against
host Villanova.

Bucknell played a_ strong
steady game and won the champi-

onship 11-4, Schroth again rose to
the occasion by scoring 5 goals.
John Ziegler ‘91 added 2 goals.
Bradbury played his best game of
the weekend. He tallied 15 saves,
while holding Villanova scoreless
in the all-important first and fourth
quarters.

Kachmarick commended her
team on “a good team perfor-
mance.” Many of the younger
players scored their first goals of
the season. Kachmarick main-
tained, “We were much stronger
than any of the competition.”

This weekend, Bucknell will
travel to Fordham University in
New York City for its first week-
end of Mid-Atlantic League play.
The Bison will face arch-rivals
Slippery Rock, Fordham, Prince-
ton, and Queens. Kachmarick
added, “This will be a very tough
and exciting weekend.”

With the polo team playing
as well as they are now, there is no
telling how far this dedicated and
intense group could go.

Cross-country fares well
in West Virginia Classic

By Jennifer Walsh
Staff Writer

The Bucknell men’s and
women’s cross-country teams met
with a fairly successful fate as they
defeated the majority of their com-
petition at the West Virginia Classic
on September 29.

The women’s team, which
was forced to run without captain
Kelly Marsh ‘91 due to bronchitis,
ran especially well for its setback of
Marsh’s absence. The Lady Bison
ran strong, defeating both Pittsburgh
and Cleveland State, while losing to
West Virginia, as the Mountaineers
posted the lowest score of 19 points.
Bucknell tallied 57 points, while
Pittsburgh followed with 63, and
Cleveland State with 114.

The top five runners for the
Lady Bison were Helene Wieting
‘91 (eighth place, 20:15), Gena
Abraham ‘93 (tenth, 20:42), Colleen
O’Mahan ‘91 (twelfth, 20:54), Kris-
tin Opdyke ‘93 (thirteenth, 21:00),
and Kris Dearorff ‘93 (fourteenth,
21:07).

Overall, Bucknell ran well
throughout the five-kilometer race,
Coach Gulden said the team had
“some much improved times”,

despite the loss of Marsh and the
defeat to West Virginia.

“We weren’t going to beat
West Virginia even if Kelly was
there, but losing her made it a lot
harder to beat Pitt,” commented
Gulden.

Wieting agreed, “We just
tried to pull together as a team,
because cross-country is generally a
team sport. I think it showed we’re
a really tough team.” Wieting, how-
ever, disagreed that the improved
scores were a surprise. “We worked
out a lot, and it finally began to pay
off,” she said. “We should start per-
forming better now.”

Gulden _ assessed, “The
women would’ve beat George
Mason in the last race if we’d run
as well as we just did. We ran
exactly the way we wanted to run,
and we were very tough in the mid-
dle of the race.” The only area of
improvement needed in that race
was, according to Gulden, “to be
more aggressive in the first mile.”

The women’s next meet will
be the Hunter College Invitational,
a race that Gulden describes as
“usually fairly competitive.” The
Hunter Invitational will be held at
Vancourtland Park.

The Bucknell men’s cross-
country team came out with results
similar to those of the women at
West Virginia, as they defeated the
mountineers 35-74, yet lost to Pitt,
23-35.

The top five finishers of the
men’s team who figured in Buck-
nell’s scoring were Matt Deardorff
“92 (third place 25:59), Bob Kelly
“92 (sixth, 26:44), Matt Loeffler ‘92
(seventh, 26:54), Jeff Loomis ‘92
(ninth, 27:01), and Norbert Berenyi
“91(tenth, 27:05).

Perhaps the most important
factor of this race was not simply
how Bucknell performed against
the teams Pittsburgh and West Vir-
ginia, but how the team reacted to
the UConn loss, ending an amazing
Bison dual meet winning streak in
cross-country just two weeks before
the West Virginia Classic.

Gulden “The team reacted
good. I don’t think it hurt us to lose
a meet. I think they bounced back
pretty well, and they’ll have to
bounce back again, every two
weeks [when a meet is held].”

Gulden added, “We still need
to improve in the middle; some of

faced conference foe Lafayette on
the Leopard’s home field, and suc-
cumbed in their fourth consecutive
1-0 loss. The statistics painted an
accurate picture of Lafayette’s
strengths and Bucknell’s
weaknesses.

The Leopards set up an
excessive amount of scoring oppor-
tunities for themselves, (17 corners
and 21 shots on goal) which pro-
duced the winning tally, while lim-
iting the Bison to a mere five shots
on and three corners. “Lafayette
was very aggressive, but it was a
poised aggressiveness,” com-
mented Averill. “Out of the eleven
Lafayette players on the field, there
were eleven players who wanted to
score.”

Goaltender Danielle Ward
‘93 played “the game of her life”
according to both Averill and co-
captain Jeanette Aurand ‘92. Ward
is now second in the Patriot league
with a save percentage of .873 - up
from fourth place last week.

Reflecting on the tough loss,
Ward commented, “We got lucky
on a lot of defensive saves. They
pounded us, but we didn’t give in.”

Ward has made good use of
last year’s bench time, which was
spent learning from Bucknell’s all-
time save record holder Maria Kee-
sling ‘90, and has more than ade-
quately filled her shoes.

“Each player needs to set
their own goals,” said Coach Ave-
rill. “There are personal goals as
well as team goals, and both are
required for a successful team.”
Averill wants to increase the num-
ber of shots and thus, the goals will
follow.

Averill has several things she
wants to work on with the team,
with consistency being a primary
issue. ““We’ve had scoring opportu-
nities, no problem. I want more
elbow grease on the shots — I

mean really cracking the ball.”
Averill also plans to “do some net-
working” on offensive corners.

Most importantly, Averill
feels that building self-confidence
in her individual players is para-
mount to having her team play as
one whole unit.

The Cornell game played
yesterday at Cornell’s home field
occurred too late to be included in
this article. As of Tuesday, the Big
Red were 2-4-1 overall and 1-2 in
the Ivy League. Cornell’s loss to
Lafayette by a score of 4-0 has
heartened the Bison, who look to
take advantage of the fast-playing
turf and outpace the Big Red.

This weekend the Bison face
Patriot league arch-rival Lehigh on

Saturday at noon and non-
conference opponent LaSalle on
Sunday at Ip.m., each at
Lewisburg.

Lehigh is struggling this year,
and Averill fully expects a well-
matched game against the Engi-
neers. LaSalle is 2-5-1 this season,
and has recently lost to Lafayette 5-
0. The Bison will be looking to
avenge last year’s 1-0 loss to the
Explorers.

Editor's note:

The Lady Bison traveled to Cornell
yesterday evening for a clash with
the Red Raiders. Game results
were not available at the time of
publication.

yet to discover a potent offensive formula.

Volleyball drops first two
Patriot League matches

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The Bucknell volleyball team
started its Patriot League play on a
down note last weekend, losing to
Army and Colgate at West Point.
Army handed the Lady Bison their
first league loss, as the Lady Cadets
played impressively in winning in
impressive fashion 15-4, 15-2, 15-
8, moving their record to 11-3
Spruce (2-0 in the Patriot League).

Colgate capitalized on Buck-
nell’s day of struggle by also
defeating the Lady Bison in three
straight games, 15-7, 15-4, 15-2.
The Red Raiders increased their
record to 9-3 (1-1). With the two
losses, Bucknell fell to 2-9 (0-2) for
the season.

“The level of play in the
league is much higher than what we
had earlier in the season,” said set-
ter/outside hitter Mary Jordan ‘93,
“there was an extra pressure that
hasn't been there before.“

Army, led by Patriot League
Player-of-the-Week B.J. Martin '92,
had no problem in handling Buck-
nell's new 6-2 offense, as they only
gave up 14 points in the entire
match. Even though Bucknell was
dominated, there were positive
things that came from the match.
The most significant was the
aggressive play of Colleen Conway
’94, who had three kills and had a
.250 hitting percentage for the
match,

“Colleen did some great
things for us coming off the bench,”
said Coach Cindy Opalski. “She
didn't play intimidated at all and
she played real aggressively when
she was in the game. I said earlier
in the season that she improves
each time she steps on to the floor,
and this a great indication of that.”

“T really wasn't expecting to
go in,” said Conway. “When I
went in I was really nervous, so I
just tried to do everything I was

taught and I hoped it would work, I
guess I was on.”

Colgate caught Bucknell off
guard in the second match, as they
took advantage of Army's stinging
victory over the Lady Bison earlier
in the day. The Red Raiders, who
posses great defensive players, (3
out of the top 5 dig leaders in the
conference) were able to hold
Bucknell to just 13 points in the
match. Kathleen Sullivan ‘92 led
all Bucknell scorers with 5 kills and
1 block, while Meg Kinney ‘92
came in and put down 4 kills and
hit .300 for the match.

“Army by far is the best team
we have seen in terms of size,
intensity, quickness and depth, and
we played a little bit timid,” said
Opalski. And when it came time to
play Colgate I think we still had a
little bit of the Army game in us, so
we weren't at our best.”

“T think one of the most sig-
nificant things this weekend is we
know we played the best two teams
in the conference,” continued Opal-
ski, “When you go into games like
these you can take one of two
roots. First there is the negative

it has made me more determined

ing to the team.”

The Lady Bison will look to
improve their record on the road
tomorrow, as they travel to Seton
Hall to face the Pirates in a non-

the Lady Bison hope to tack on
some wins to their 2-9 start.

Tennis wins three

By Christopher Mosunic
Staff Writer

The Bucknell women’s tennis
team had a terrific past week. The
Lady Bison went undefeated in
three matches against Saint Francis,
Franklin & Marshall, and
Delaware.

Coach Rose Ewan reached a
milestone in her career by winning
her 100th match against Delaware,
as the Lady Bison defeated the Blue
Hens Saturday 5-4.

The competition was
extremely tough. Kymm Carlson
‘94, Karen Stagliano ‘92, Stepha-
nie Ryer ‘91, and Jennifer Wyckoff
“92 all took their matches in three
sets.

Elizabeth Murphy ‘94 com-
mented, "This was one of the most
exciting matches of the year. It
came really close, but Kymm and
Kim pulled off a doubles win that

took us for the win.”

The most exciting victory of
the day came from Ryer. She
played hard but Sherry Haideri of
Delaware just scraped by to win
the first set 7-5. Ryer rebounded to
win the second set by the same 7-5.

The third set turned out to be
a barn-bumer. With endless vol-
leys and many heart-stomping
shots at each other, until the ladies
reached a tiebreaker, which Ryer
won 10-8. Though Bucknell's
singles players played well, the
squad’s doubles teams struggled.
Mary Ann Benack ‘92 and Stagli-
ano were shut down by the strong
Delaware doubles team of Tara
Finnegan and Katherine Adams.
Finnegan also beat Benack for a
Blue Hen singles win.

Carlson and Thompson then
won their doubles match easily 6-3,

thing we could possibly do we did
right. We just couldn’t find the
back of the net.”

Lovecchio continued, “We
were stringing together passes, and
getting shots which was nice to
see. Defensively, except for two or
three lapses, I thought we played
pretty well.”

Unfortunately one of these
lapses allowed a goal in the second
half when Gettysburg got a breaka-
way as the Bullets made a good
transition moving the ball from
their defenders to their strikers.

nell defense and made a shot from

taken down by one of the defend-
ers. The resulting foul led to a pen-
alty kick for forward Kathy Ot ‘91.

On Ow’s first kick, the Bullet
goalkeeper Tiffany Bridges moved
too soon giving Ott a second oppor-
tunity. This doubled the pressure on
Ott, but she scored on the following
shot, a beautiful goal to cut the lead
in half at 83:52.

The Lady Bison kept the
pressure on, playing well both
offensively and defensively, but
were unable to score again. Goal-
keeper Bridget Collins played the
entire game, compiling thirteen
saves.

“We had some excellent
opportunities to score,” said Lovec-

in their own end area giving the
Bison a chance to tie the score with
a penalty kick.

Kirk Lorie ‘91 took the kick
and blasted a shot that hit off the
crossbar and bounced back to the
Bison leaving them with another
point blank attempt on goal. But
this shot also missed, striking Col-
gate keeper Gonzalo Bearman
directly in the chest, wasting
another golden opportunity.

Bucknell could not manage to
keep the pressure on, and had only
one other legitimate attempt at
scoring when a Gulick header
found its way past Colgate’s Bear-
man but went just wide of the net.

Alex Roe finished off the
game for Colgate by adding an
insurance goal past second-half
keeper Mark Wrigley ‘94 with just
over 13 minutes remaining, dimin-
ishing any hopes the Bison had of a
comeback.

“We just didn’t come out the
way we could today.” said a down-
cast Terry Pelino ‘91. “Our heads
weren’t into it, and we paid the
price for it.”

“We showed a definite lack
of poise and composure in the sec-

chio. “We were unfortunate in that
some of these opportunities were
stopped.”

Sweeper Shannon Smith ‘92
said, “We had a slow start. We got
it together in the second half, and if
we'd had more time we would
have gotten another goal. We
always start out flat and then we
get going.”

Krause agreed, “We start the
game out slow, we let them get a
quick goal and then we finally start
playing. We came out well after
halftime but then we _ were
unlucky,” she said. “It’s pretty frus-
trating, actually. We just seem to be
a second half team.”

Even Lovecchio commented
that “we usually play teams better
in the second half...it was a game
we could have won. They weren’t
any better than us or any worse.”

There are some things the

ond half,” continued Reynolds. “It
wasn’t a horrible game, it was just
one of those days.”

The team continued their sea-
son with a contest last Tuesday at
Bloomsburg. Bucknell controlled
play for most of the first half, but
found themselves down 1-0 when a
low percentage shot from Tom Jer-
amez found its way past Racek into
the upper left-hand corner of the
Bison net.

Bucknell showed signs of
becoming flustered, before recover-
ing with a score of their own five
minutes later. Gulick penetrated the
Bloomsburg defense and launched
a crossing pass which Jon Macken-
zie ‘93 promptly headed into the
net.

From that point on Bucknell
controlled play, but just couldn’t
manage to capitalize. Finally, after
continuously knocking on the door
throughout the second half, Buck-
nell added another goal when
Gulick again beat the defense and
scored with ten minutes remaining
in the contest.

The final result was a 2-1
Bison victory, and a sigh of relief
from both the coaching staff and

team hopes to improve on before
its game tomorrow at Temple.
Smith said that the team has to
work on marking and talking, but
assured, “We'll play well against
Temple.”

Krause is looking forward to
the game as well; she feels that the
primary aspect the team needs to
work on is to be ready at the begin-
ning of the game.

Lovecchio thinks that the
Lady Bison have to try to take
more shots. “We must shoot to
score,” he stressed. “We've just got
to play for ninety minutes, and be
intense and aggressive for the
entire game.”

Lovecchio feels that being
able to play intense for the com-
plete game will make everything
else fall into place. Tomorrow’s
game with the Owls will be tough,
but the Lady Bison are optimistic
that it will produce another victory.

“Tt wasn’t as close a game as
the score might indicate,” said
Reynolds. “We had good penetra-
tion throughout the second half, and
if weren’t for a bit of bad luck, the
score could have just as easily been
4-1.”

The team continues play
tomorrow as it hosts Patriot league
foe Army, and then plays former
ECC rival Towson State on
Tuesday.

When asked to comment on
the Army squad, Reynolds

said,"We’ve never played them
before, but I have a feeling they’ll
be deep, talented, and very
aggressive.

As for Towson State, they’ ve
got a lot of players back from their
conference championship team of
last year, They’ve got the person-
nel, and we're going to need a
tough performance to beat them.”

Bucknell is now 2-1 in the
Patriot League and 7-2 overall. The
Bison need two solid performances
this week if they wish to keep their
hopes of post-season play alive.

Comell took the Bucknell punt,
which was downed on the Big
Red’s own 1-yard line. A few playa
‘later, Higgins picked off his third
pass of the season. The Bison took
the ball the 30 yards, ending with a
one-yard sneak by Hatajik up the
middle to make the score 28-14.
The drive was highlighted by a 14-
yard completion from Hatajik to
Scocca to the Cornell three-yard
line.

Bucknell increased its lead to
35-14 on its next drive. After stop-

the Bison took over the ball on the

for his third touchdown of the day.
The score was set up by two earlier

“Last year, they only won

Bison must watch out for sopho-
more Jarrett Grier, who in his colle-
giate debut, rushed for 111 yards

increase their winning streak to

surprises golf team

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

The golf team finished
twelfth in a twenty-two team field
last Friday in the Susquehanna
Tournament. The invitational held
in Hazleton, PA, was somewhat of
a setback for Bucknell, as the team
turned in relatively high scores in a
fairly uncompetitive field.

Coach Thompson did not
express concern over’ the results,
however, despite the fact that the
ECAC qualifier is rapidly approach-
ing (Oct. 4). He feels that the tour-
Nament was not an accurate repre-
sentation of the team, as only two
of his regular five players
participated.

The squad entered the Sus-
quehanna Tournament last week
with a largely revamped team and
an entirely new set of expectations.
Thompson tried a new team which
consisted of regulars Scott Miller
“93, and Don Hansen ‘94, and the
first-time players Glenn Hertzberg
“92, Chris Curti ‘94, and Howie
Livingston ‘93.

According to Thompson,
“The purpose in the change was to
see a new set of players, and how
they would react to the pressures of
a tournament.” As a result, the
scores were the highest yet for the
young team.

Livingston led Bucknell,
shooting an 83. Miller, Hertzberg,
and Curti followed with an 84, 85,
and 87, respectively. Most surpris-
ing was Hansen’s 90 for the day, an
uncharacteristically high score for
the usually steady player. While the
scores were high for the team, the
players are not concerned.

“The team just wanted to
make sure we eradicated all of our

6-0, securing the Bucknell victory.

The Bison easily defeated
Saint Frances 6-0 on Sunday. Each
player won her match in straight
sets, but due to rain the doubles
matches were cancelled. Bucknell
was declared the winner and
increased its record up 4-2.

Tuesday Bucknell beat Frank-
lin & Marshall 4-2 in Lancaster,
PA. Bucknell won four of the six
singles matches, as doubles play
was cancelled because of darkness.

Franklin & Marshall proved to

lackluster play before the ECAC
qualifier on Thursday,” said Han-
sen. “I obviously took care of that
myself.”

Miller added, “We can play
better. We just weren’t mentally
into (the tournament) as much as
we should have been. We have a
decent shot at qualifying for the
ECAC.”

Coach Thompson agreed,
“We didn’t play very well.” The
field of teams was less competitive
than others in the past, leaving
open the possibility of the Bison
finishing in the top five, had they
broken 320 for the top four players.

In the ECAC qualifier, Buck-
nell will be facing many of the
same teams that they will see in the
spring. For this reason, the ECAC
tournament can be considered an
indication of how the golfers will
fare against others in the spring.
The tournament will be held on the
same course as the F&M tourna-
ment, where the Bison played its
first tournament this season.
Thompson feels this will be a defi-
nite advantage for them, as the
team already has a feel for the
conditions.

One of Bucknell’s team goals
is to beat Lehigh, one of the
tougher squads playing at ECAC’s.
With a score of 320 or better,
Thompson is confident that his
team can break the top ten and the
players can achieve they goal.

The team will face several of
the same schools that they will see
at the ECAC qualifier when they
play in the Norstar Bank classic,
scheduled for Monday. Thompson
has a great deal of confidence
going into both the ECAC qualifier
and the Norstar Classic, predicting,
“We will be ready.”

Football rolls over oe 42- 21

Bison annihilate second straight lvy League foe, improve record to 3-]

By Scott Brown
Staff Writer

Led by the powerful running
of Brian Henesey ‘92, the Bison
football team rolled to its third
straight victory with a 42-21
trouncing of Cornell last Saturday
The win ran Bucknell’s record to 3-
1, its best start since 1981.

The key to the game was
Bucknell’s strong offensive attack.
The Bison amassed 425 total yards,
including 250 on the ground. Hene-
sey led all rushers with 159 yards
on 26 carries. This placed him
eighth overall on the Bucknell all-
time rushing list. Henesey hopes to
continue his current success, as he

is averaging over 100 yards a
game.

“It's every running back’s
dream to have a 1,000 yard sea-
son,” said Henesey. “That is my
goal this season but it sure will be
tough to keep up this pace.”

Quarterback Todd  Hatajik
‘91 had another sensational week,
throwing for 175 yards on 14 of 18
passing. In his last two games, Hat-
ajik has completed 32 of 39
attempts.

As they have done in the
three previous games, Bucknell
scored first, taking the early advan-
tage. On its first series the team
drove 76 yards on 11 plays to take
a 7-0 lead. On the drive the Bison

Tuesday the women’s soccer
team suffered a disappointing 2-1
loss at home against the Gettysburg
Bullets. The record of the Lady
Bison now stands at 1-4 after
notching their victory last week
against Wilkes.

The first goal for the Bullets
came at 31:50 in the first half,

when Gettysburg forward Emily
Brown was able to score off an
assist by teammate Heather
Shenefiel.

The Lady Bison came close
to tying the game when forward
Amy Krause ‘91 shot a direct kick
which hit the inside of the post and
bounced out, but there was no one
there to follow it up before a Bullet
defense player took control of the
ball.

accumulated four first downs,
including a conversion of a third-
and-twenty from Cornell’s 37-yard
line. A 23-yard completion from
Hatajik to Dan Scocca ‘91 kept the
drive alive. The touchdown was
scored by Craig Cavlovic ‘91 ona
one-yard plunge, his first score
since 1987.

Bucknell got the ball back
three plays later after Mike Augs-
berger ‘91 recovered a Comell
fumble on the Cornell 48. Bucknell
drove the field 52 yards in 5.27 cul-
minating with another one-yard run
by Cavlovic for the score. The 12
play drive consisted of 11 rushing
plays, constituung 49 of the 52
yards.

The first quarter ended with
Bucknell holding a commanding
14-0 lead, primarily due to the
strong rushing attack. The Bison
had 128 total yards for the quarter,
94 of which were on the ground.

For the season the Bison have
won when they have rushed the ball
well. In this three-game winning
streak, the offense has rushed for at
least 200 yards in each contest.

Henesey stressed the impor-
tance of the running game by stat-
ing, “It opens up the passing game.
It is important to run. The running
and passing games complement
each other.”

Coach Lou Maranzana
agreed, “The running game abso-
lutely correlates to winning. We
have to run to get everything else to
work. It keeps people away from
being down our throats so that we
can pass the ball. It offers us some

zone situations to go against. The
running allows us to possess the
ball and keeps our opponents off
the field. At worst, if we run well
we can punt the ball down field to
set up our defense with good ficld
position.”

After neither team could con-
vert on their initial possession of
the second quarter the ball went
back to Cornell. They drove 67
yards on nine plays to cut the mar-
gin to 14-7 finishing with a five-
yard rush off left tackle by Scott
Oliaro, 1989 Ivy League Sopho-
more of the Year.

Bucknell didn’t falter though,
as they drove right back into the
end zone on its next possession to
again post a two-touchdown advan-
tage. The drive, which began at its
own 25-yard line, ended with a
seven yard scramble around the
right side by Hatajik. This drive,
unlike the previous two scoring
drives, was mainly done through
the air.

Hatajik connected on all four
of his passing attempts for 58
yards, including completions of 16
and 18 yards to Lester Erb ‘91.

With just over three minutes
left to play in the half, Cornell took
the kickoff and marched from their
own 37 to the Bucknell eight yard
line with the help of some careless
mistakes by the Bucknell defense.
Twice, the Bison defense was
nailed with personal fouls, account-
ing for 24 extra yards on the Cor-
nell attack, as well as stopping the
clock for the Big Red as time was
running out.

With great protection from fullback Craig Cavlovic ’92, quarterback
Todd Hatajik ’91 looks downfield for an open receiver.

With a first down on the
eight-yard line, Cornell attempted
three straight runs but were denied
each time, the final two tackles
coming from Corey Castellani ‘94,
who led the Bison with ten tackles
for the day.

Comell called a time-out to
discuss whether to attempt a 17-
yard field goal or go for the fourth
down conversion with only 31 sec-
onds left to play in the half. They
decided to go for the touchdown,
and the move proved effective as
Oliaro scored his second touch-
down of the game making over left
end to bring the the halftime score

to 21-14.

Coach Maranzana was not
pleased with the way the half
ended, stating “They had a 50-yard
drive and we gave them 30 yards of
it. It was really dumb. Mike Augs-
berger was trying to strip the ball as
the runner was held up, and (Bill)
Higgins ‘91 raised his leg to protect
himself from someone stepping on
him but it looked like we were
retaliating. We just can’t have that
happen.”

The second half started with
an unsuccessful drive by the Bison.

According to head coach
Toby Lovecchio, “We were very

wasn’t playing man-to-man defense

But after halftime the Lady

The Colgate men’s soccer
team was not intimidated by Buck-
nell’s 6-1 record, as it took advan-
tage of some costly Bison mistakes
and left Lewisburg with a 2-0 vic-
tory last Saturday.

Game day weather was over-
cast and the field was noticeably
wet, thus contributing to the game’s
sloppy play. The contest was filled
with many _ penalties, which
resulted in one red card, five yel-
low cards, one penalty kick, and
numerous minor injuries.

The Bison came out slow in
the first half both offensively and
defensively, and the Red Raiders
took the instant advantage. Colgate
capitalized on a miscommunication
between the Bucknell defense and
goalie Scott Racek ‘91 at 5:49 of
the first half. Colegate’s Scott Cole-
man got a foot on a loose ball in
front of the Bucknell net for a
quick tally past Racek and an early
1-0 Red Raider lead. To make mat-
ters worse, the Bison lost their lead-
ing scorer Ken Gulick ‘91 for the

remainder of the half just two min-
utes later when he was injured on a
collision in front of the Bison net.
As a result, the Bison found them-
selves unable to mount any offen-
sive pressure, and were forced into
their own end for nearly the entire
half. Bucknell did get a break just
before halftime when Colgate’s Jon
Carter was ejected from the game,
leaving the Red Raiders to play the
remainder of the contest with only
ten men on the field.

“Emotionally, we came out
ready to play in the first half, “ said
Coach Reynolds. “We were just out
of sync, like a record playing on the
wrong speed. The first goal we just
gave away because of bad commu-
nication, poor execution, and bad
decision-making.”

The Bison started the second
half hoping to capitalize on their
one-man advantage. _— Bucknell
caught what seemingly looked to
be the break they needed when the
game referee made another suspect
call just two minutes into the half,
He whistled Colgate for a penalty

Bucknell nationally
ranked in liberal arts

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Bucknell was ranked at
the top of the second quartile for
“National Liberal-Arts — Col-
leges” finishing just out of the
top twenty-five, in the October
15 issue of U.S. News & World
Report.

The ranking incorporated
academic reputation, student
selectivity, faculty resources,
financial resources, student sat-
isfaction, SAT/ACT scores of
Students, acceptance rates, edu-
cation of faculty, student to
faculty ration, total spending per
student, and graduation rates.

President Sojka said that
he “can’t be too upset with
where we are... [Because Buck-
nell is] in with some awfully
good people.”

Sojka explained that the
top twenty five category is very
tough to break into. “If I look at
what they call the top twenty-
five in that category I honesty
think probably twenty-two of
them without much argument
would have to be considered
institutions with a little bit more
going for them than we’ ve got in
terms of endowment, student to
faculty ratio, the prestige of the
faculty, pre-college preparation

of students, selectivity... all of
those things.”

Sojka did express dissatis-
faction at the whole idea of “rank-
ing colleges” for several reasons.
He has argued in the past that the
idea is misleading to students
who go by the rankings as
opposed to finding out about
schools for themselves.

In past years Sojka found
fault with the categorization of
schools. “When Bucknell was
called the best comprehensive
university east of the Mississippi
{along with St. Olaf] a few years
ago we objected on_ several
grounds. 1) East of the Missis-
sippi says very plainly a regional
institution and we feel that we
qualify as a national institution...
2) We were in what they call
comprehensive universities and
that was an ill defined group of
frankly mismatched institutions
with little in common.” Now
Bucknell is classified as a
“National Liberal-Arts College”
which Sojka feels puts the Uni-
versity “in the right group, that is,
a nationally based highly selec-
tive prestigious institution.”

Sojka also responded to
reports that the University’s
selectivity has gone down as evi-
denced by the fact that Bucknell

Bison plans further delayed

By Tara G. Gilligan
Staff Writer

Material delays, caused by
the crisis in the Persian Gulf and
the threat of economic recession,
have set back the completion of the
Bison renovation project by
approximately two weeks. The
Bison, a student social center
located on the bottom floor of the
Langone Center, should open on
Nov. 16 despite earlier indications
that it would open November 1.

The contractor, architect, and
several administrators set the final
date during a job meeting yester-
day. According to Mary Dorsey,
acting assoc. dean of orientation
and activities, the construction will
end on the afternoon of November
16. During the evenings of Novem-
ber 16 and 17 the Bison Program-
ming Committee wil sponsor a
grand opening celebration.

Several problems attibuted to
the delayed opening. “There’s any
number of problems that have
cropped up. I can’t really point to
any particular one saying this is a
hold up, “ said Jim Hostetler, man-
ager of construction.

The most pressing delay cur-
rently is the difficulty in obtaining
materials, especially furnishings,
necessary for completion. Hostetler
said that vendors are weary of
stocking shelves with excess mate-
rials because of the threat of eco-
nomic recession.

Middle East lecture series
examines US role in Gulf

By Natalie Dunlap
Staff Writer

The International Relations
Program has been sponsoring a
series of lectures examining the
Persian Gulf Crisis. These weekly
lectures began September 18 and
will finish in November with a
panel discussion.

Stephen Stamos, professor of
international relations, spoke on the
“Economic Aspects of the Gulf Cri-
sis” Tuesday October 9. One of his
main focuses was the production
and consumption of oil for various
countries. Through his talk, he tried
to show “our gluttonous use of
petroleum” which he determined to
be 8,264 barrels of petroleum per
day in the U.S. or 17 gallons per
second.

Another area of analysis was
the global ecomony before and after
Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. Stamos

observed that “most of the enthu-
siasm and euphoria for the integra-
tion of Western and Eastern
Europe has burst because of the
Persian Gulf Crisis.”

Conceming a Gulf war, Sta-
mos believes that “to be willing to
go into a war which could sink a
country into a state of depression is
suicidal.” He did say, however,
that if the choice is between an
early war or a sustained war, he
would choose an early war: “We
can’t afford to make this a pro-
longed effort either in waiting or in
a prolonged war...not with the con-
sequences.”

Stamos’ final point was the
energy policy in the United States.
He summarized that we have “to
stop burning fossil fuels.” He
observed that “any one carryover
from the late *70s is the concentra-
tion on energy conservation.” He
believes that this is our only hope

for a sustainable future and that if
the U.S. would have steadily con-
centrated on this issue instead of
“just renewing interest in our prob-
lem with fossil fuels when some-
thing like this [Persian Gulf Crisis]
happens,” we would not be in this
position of contemplating war.

In earlier lectures, both Dick
Peterec, professor of geography
and international relations, and
Tom Travis, professor of political
science and international relations
and director of the International
Relations Program, predicted that
war is likely before the end of the
year. Travis maintains, “There is no
room for compromise. A major war
is coming.” The kind of war that
this is likely to be and the conse-
quences of such a war will be dis-
cussed this coming Tuesday by
Tansa Massoud, visiting assistant

Construction on the Bison progresses amid delays stemming from economic woes resulting from the Per-

sian Gulf Crisis.

“We're finding that with a
recession either imminent or likely
and people not knowing exactly
what’s going to happen in the Per-
sian Gulf, vendors are just ner-
vous...about tying up money in
inventories,” said Hostetler. As a
result, contractors are finding it
more difficult to attain materials.

As an example of the types of
delays affecting the renovation pro-
cess, Hostetler said that “some of
the tile that’s supposed to be
installed in the building is aboard a
ship between Italy and Texas. This
is a tile that would normally be in
stock and we’re attempting to expe-
dite the process.”

Mary Dorsey, associate dean
for student acitivities, discussed the
effects of the Persian Gulf crisis in
regards to the Bison renovations.
“Apparently the situation in the
Persian Gulf is delaying some of
the materials for delivery. I guess
there’s a demand for material from
other sources that have a higher pri-
ority than what we have here,” she

said.

Hostetler expected another
shipment of materials by the end of
the week. “If we get that and the
final third comes in in a week or
two weeks, I think we’ll be in good
shape for that mid-November
date,” he said.

These most recent delays
have inconvenienced the Bison Pro-
gramming Committee, which will
schedule events to be held in the
newly renovated center. “It’s frus-
trating that they cannot give us a
date because it makes our lives mis-
erable,” said Steve Wolin, chair of
the committee, before the decision
on the completion date.

The committee does have one
event, a dance marathon co-
sponsored by Students Against
Muscular Sclerosis and the Buck-
nell Student Government, planned
for Dec. 7. That date, according to
Hostetler, is fairly safe. “I can’t
conceive of anything that could
delay us that long,” he said.

Other delays have affected

the renovations, as well. “It was
possible, at one point, that we
would have had to delay this pro-
ject a whole year,” said Dorsey,
referring to the unexpected need to
remove asbestos from the area.
“There was a delay of the
start of the project this summer
caused by the need to remove the
spray-applied fire-proofing material
which...contained asbestos,” _ex-
plained Barry Maxwell, vice presi-
dent for administration. The fire-
proofing contained 10-15% asbes-
tos and was of no threat to staff
working in the building. However,
the asbestos could have posed a
threat to construction workers.
After removing the asbestos,
another type of fire-proofing had to
be applied. “The contractor did that
for us, but that took a week and
under any sort of change, the con-
tractor is entitled to ask for an
extension to the contract,” said

January Plan proposal to
be reconsidered by COl

Laura Landsiedel/The Bucknellian

Andrea Halpern, chairman of
the Committee on Instruction,
discusses the future of the Jan
Plan with the faculty.

By Anne Ervin

During a_ special faculty
meeting Monday, the faculty sent a
proposal to change the January Pro-
gram back to the Committee on
Instruction (COI).

COI’s proposal included a
graduation requirement for student
participation, a shortening of the
January term from four to three
weeks, and the creation of a special
council to oversee the entire
program,

After some discussion, a
straw vote was taken to gauge the
faculty’s feelings on these two
issues. A vast majority of the
faculty members were against the
proposal; thus, they decided to send
it back to COI for reconsideration.

ROTC survives FTX

This is the third time that the
faculty has postponed definitive
action on the January program. The
first time the faculty pushed back
consideration from September to
their October meeting. At the Octo-
ber meeting the faculty began dis-
cussion of COI’s proposals with ten
minutes left in the meeting, and
decided to hold this special
meeting.

The January program has
been under scrutiny due to declin-
ing faculty and student involve-
ment. It is estimated that only
thirty five percent of students par-
ticipate in the four week program.

The faculty will again discuss
the future of the Jan Plan when
COI comes back with another set of
recommendations.

professor of political science.

Travis began organizing this
lecture series at the beginning of the
semester when the Persian Gulf cri-
ses developed. Lectures are held on
Tuesday evenings from 7-8 p.m. in
the Olin Science Auditorium with a
brief question and answer period
following each Jecture.

Travis, as well as the other
faculty in the International Rela-
tions Program, has been “pleased
with the turn out of about 50 to 70
students at each lecture. We hope to
make this lecture series an annual
event where each year there would
be a lecture series on a critical inter-
national event.”

Travis initiated the lecture
series because, “The International
Relations Program sees as its pur-
pose not only to educate Interna-
tional Relations majors but also the

general campus community about
important international issues.”

Speakers for the seven lec-
tures are members of the Bucknell
faculty. Travis explained that there
are “remarkably strong faculty
resources at Bucknell so that we
can recruit lecturers from our
midsts to cover these complicated
and multifaceted topics.”

The entire lecture schedule
including the dates, topics, and lec-
turers are as follows: September
18—"Geographic and International
Legal Dimensions of the Gulf Cri-
sis” by Richard Peterec; September
25—“Historical Sources of the
Gulf Crisis” by Richard Waller,

went deep into its waiting list this
past year. He explained that “eve-
tywhere in the U. S., selectivity’s
gone down because there are about
a third fewer students there today
than there were eight or nine years
ago and so everybody’s in their
wait lists.”

According to Sojka though,
Bucknell’s relative selectivity has
increased because “if you look
around, we’re one of the few
places that made our class target
this year.” He noted that there is “a
lot of doom and gloom out there,”
and that “some of those places [in
the first quartile] have got serious
problems with empty beds...
they’re very worried about keep-
ing their dorms running.”

Sojka noted that Bucknell is
holding its own although “it’s a
tough time out there.”

Bombing linked
to Libya

American investigators said
this week that newly uncovered
evidence concerning the December
1988 bombing of a Pan American
jumbo jet points to Libyan involve-
ment in assembling and planting
the bomb

The inquiry into the bombing
had focused on evidence that Iran
hired a Syrian-sponsored terrorist
group, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General

Command, to bomb the airplane.

The new evidence indicates
that the Popular Front’s leader,
Ahmed Jabril, hired agents of Col
Muammar el-Quaddafi, leader of
Libya, to plant the bomb after
Jabril discovered that Western
intelligence agents had penetrated
his organization.

UN condemns
Israeli shootings

The United States asked the
United Nations Security Council to
approve a resolution condemning
Israel for excessive use of force in
halting violence against Jewish
worshippers at the Western Wall,
the holiest site in Judeism.

The severe wording of the
resolution was in part an attempt to
hold the Arab coalition together
against Iraq. Not since the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon in 1982 has
the United States supported a reso-
lution directly condemning Israel or
one which did not balance the criti-

cism with criticism for Palestinians
as well.

The situation began when a
few dozen Israeli police closed the
Al Aksa mosque in Jerusalem, the
third holiest site in Islam. In
response, about 3,000 Palestinians
rioted outside the mosque and
threw stones and bottles down on
Jewish worshippers at the Western
Wall below. Troops opened fire on
the crowd, killing nineteen

Bush flip-flops on
tax issue

After signing a stopgap spend-
ing measure to keep the federal gov-
ernment operating, President Bush
said he would consider raising
income tax rates for wealthy Ameri-
cans. A few hours later, he aban-
doned the position after strong
opposition from Republican
senators.

Democratic leaders were
“totally thunderstruck” by Bush’s
reversal, said one senator. Immedi-
ate Democratic reaction was
unclear, but the President’s actions
likely ruined any chance of changes
in either capital gains or income tax

rates and made bipartisan compro-
mise much more difficult.

Congress passed a resolution
Monday financing government
spending at last year’s levels up to
October 19. The White House and
Congress now must write a new
budget in one week after rejecting a
plan written by White House and
Congressional leaders over a four
month period.

Navy does not
accept women

A “considerable segment” of
faculty, staff, and midshipmen at
the United States Naval Academy

believe that women have no place
at the facility, according to an inter-
nal academy review made public.
The report by the academy’s
Women Midshipmen Study Group
was one of four studies commis-
sioned after it was disclosed that a
former midshipman, Gwen Marie
Dreyer, had been handcuffed to a
urinal and photographed by at least
eight male midshipmen on the eve
of the Army-Navy football game.
Despite fourteen years of
women being accepted into the
academy, women must still face
“low-level sexual harassment” as
“normal operating procedure” in
some classrooms and among some
students, according to the report

The contractor, Hepco. Con-
struction Co., did request an exten-
sion of a few days, which the uni-
versity was obliged to grant.

Additional problems resulted
from day to day delays. “We’ve had
other delays. Every construction
project is a problem in progress and
most of them you are able to sur-
mount,” Hostetler said.

Plans for the stage area
include a hardwood floor, specially
treated in the south. The floor
arrived incorrectly treated, causing
a delay of approximately ten days,
according to Hostetler.

Delays of this sort are typical
to-construction projects, Hostetler
said, and “those sorts of things can
sometimes be compensated for dur-
ing the course of the project.”

But because of the quick pace
of construction, dealing with even
day to day problems is difficult.
“We’re not able, on a fast-track pro-
ject of this nature, to bounce back
from a lot of the little glitches that
are thrown to us by the vaguery of
construction,” said Hostetler.

Aside from the cost incurred
from the abatement of asbestos, no
additional costs accompanied the

struction contract and the construc-
tion costs associated with the pro-
ject were not impacted adversely
by that delay,” said Maxwell.

The approved project budget
of $778,000. The construction
accounts for an _ estimated
$441,000, the guaranteed maxi-
mum price. According to Hostetler,
the actual cost of construction
should approach, but not exceed,
this figure. The remaining
$337,000 budgeted for the project
will cover furnishings.

“It’s a little bit unusual that
the Physical Plant would order all
the furnishings for the project, but
Barry Maxwell has gone on record
saying when the project opens he
wants everything in place and he
thinks we should make one grand
display of the whole project,” said
Hostetler.

As long as the contractor
completes the project within a few
weeks of the expected completion
date, he should not suffer any
losses. The only adverse effect,
according to Maxwell, is that “the
construction period will run a little
bit longer than we had originally
estimated.”

Healthy surprises greet
visitors at Walnut Acres

By Jen Marshall

Walnut Acres is a cool place.
I could tell right from the start,
when my tour guide Dennis gave
me a free Walnut Acres farm hat.
“Since this is a food processing
area,” he firmly said, “EVERY-
ONE has to wear a hat.” I happily
set my green and white paper hat
on my head, ready to experience
organic farming. “Did you know,”
Dennis proudly announced, “that
people have been spotted all over
wearing these hats? They wear
them to fairs and to concerts and
just about anywhere!” I liked Den-
nis a lot, but 1 wondered what kinds
of concerts he went to. I didn’t
have much time to think about Den-
nis’s probable barn jamborees star.
ring Bobby Hayseed Joe, because
he started talking about Walnut
Acres farm almost faster than I
could write.

Walnut Acres, located about
thirty minutes from Bucknell in
Penns Creek, is a world famous
organic farm. (And you thought
that there wasn’t anything exciting
for miles around this side of Phili-
delphia!) Walnut Acres was
founded by Paul and Betty Keene

{

‘

i

Unusual organically produced foods such as cookies, veggie burgers,

in 1946, a farming couple dedicated
to chemical-free agriculture. Paul
and Betty met while teaching at a
mission school in India. It was
there that they became interested in
organic farming, and decided to
move their agricultural adventures
to Pennsylvania. Deeply in debt
after puchasing land and then farm
equipment, Paul and Betty had just
enough money to convert the land’s
existing crop of apples into an
apple butter called “Apple
Essence.” Somehow, the food critic
from the New York Times tasted
it, and then wrote a glowing review
of Walnut Acres’ first product. Paul
and Betty were suddenly swamped
with mail order requests for Apple
Essence, which they sold for one
dollar a quart. Walnut Acres today
Produces over two hundred and
fifty farm fresh, organic products.
There is a store and small dining
area at the farm, and a catalogue of
tasty, but healthy treats can now be
had at your nearest mailbox. Den-
nis informed me that Walnut Acres
has customers from all over, even
from Africa and Tasmania

Dennis began our tour in the
warehouse, which was adjacent to
the store. The warehouse was large,

chased at Walnut Acres in nearby Penns Creek.

and full of stacks of boxes marked
“corn chowder.” I saw a few Wal-
nut Acres workers moving crates
and pushing hand carts. They
weren’t wearing hats, and I was
beginning to suspect that Dennis
just liked to make visitors look like
geeks. The only thing memorable
about the warehouse was it’s
extreme cleanliness. Everything at
Walnut Acres seemed to sparkle.
Other than that, it was an average
warehouse.

Our next stop was the gigan-
tic refrigeration room. Since Wal-
nut Acres doesn’t use preserva-
tives, refrigeration is neccessary to
keep their products fresh. Dennis
had an interesting trivia fact for us
while we toured the forty degree
store-room. Did you know that on
the average, the food that you buy
and eat from the supermarket has
traveled TWO THOUSAND miles
before it reaches your stomach?!
Yikes! Walnut Acres looks better
and better, seeing as most of their
products are produced and pack-
aged on the premises

Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. The
machines are pleasantly antiquated,
and an air of kinship pervades
among the bakers. Cookies and
breads are made fresh, with mini-
mal use of sugar and salt. Almost
all of the baking process is done by
hand. Everything is made in small
batches, because most things at the
Walnut Acres store only sit on the
shelf for two weeks. Compare that
to the twinkie that’s probably been
sitting on Weis’ shelf since the
stone age!

We visited the packaging
area, and the mail room. All of the
workers seemed to love each other
so much. They were smiling and
chatting and listening to country
music. (And most of them weren’t
wearing hats!) Dennis soon
explained the family-like atmos-
phere of Walnut Acres. Everyone
practically IS family! Mothers,
daughters, fathers, sons-in-law and
cousins all work together at Walnut
Acres. The two women managing
the mail room were mother and
daughter, and they worked together
all day, everyday without tearing
each other’s eyes out. I was
impressed. Walnut Acres is an
employee-owned company. The
longer a person works there, the
more company stock they can own.
As a result, job turnover at Walnut
Acres is miminal.

At last, we got to go shop-

Traditions steeped

by Cindy Levinson
Staff Writer

Bucknell has had a long his-
tory of interesting traditions, some
of which are still common today.
For example, the “Freshmen Fif-
teen” is attributed to the “hoagie
lady” who came to the dorms every
night with a cart filled with freshly
baked chocolate chip cookies,
chocolate milk from Betchel’s
Dairy and hoagies.

One of the fondest memories
of Win Springer Brickmeier (63)
as written in “Kiss—on the first
date?” in Bucknell World (Septem-
ber, 1990) was the serenades. Fra-
ternity members would stand below
a balcony in their fraternity blazers,
holding candles, sing serenades to
the sweetheart of their fraternity. It
was every girls dream to be
admired by a frat.

Some lingo, as found in the
B.U. Traditions file in the Bucknell
archives, includes the phrase “Hell
Week” which refers a time in the
fall after school has started when
freshmen women appear without
makeup and wear weird things at
the request of sophomore women.
“Sem” was the name given to the
Women’s College that came from
when the boys called on the girls at
the Women’s Seminary once a
week and stayed until nine o’clock.
An “import” was a girlfriend who
came to stay for a weekend and
was often treated poorly by the
women in the Sem. What is now
called the Bison, was called
George’s. Words like “Soash”
(sociology), “Sike” (psychology),
“Poly Si” (political science), and
“Fizz Ed” (physical education) are

still used today.

Many of the traditions,
though, involve freshmen hazing
and general harassment of the
freshmen class by the sophomore
class. In 1909, a former Bucknell
student, Wm. A. Bartol wrote a
booklet entitled Bucknell Tradi-
tions. He refered to freshmen with
names such as “papoose” and
“ignoramus.” Upperclassmen
would shout “Freshmen Look!” and
then begin pointing at and mocking
freshmen. He also included a satiri-
cal characterization of freshmen as
follows:

I. Freshmen wear regulation
Postage stamps on their pates.

II. Freshmen keep their toot-
sies warm with shoes.

III. Freshmen keep on the
everlasting forward march and let
the other classmen loaf.

IV. Freshmen eat, drink,
sleep, attend recitations, functions,
and walk or breathe only on Partic-
ular request. Understand!

V. Freshmen are it in the uni-
versity game of tag.

In an article entitled “Rebel
in a Birdcage” by B. Winston Bar-
rett (’31) in Bucknell World Guly,
1987), there are stories of how one
freshmen was “paddled severely
enough to draw blood.” The author
relates how he was accused of not
speaking to anyone, especially
upperclassmen, so he received
three swats with the paddle and had
to wear a birdcage on his head,
opening the little door each time he
opened his mouth to speak.

Beginning in the late nine-
teenth century and continuing until
the 1970’s, the freshmen and soph-

omore classes participated in class
scraps. The two classes lined up
about 30 feet apart and when a gun
was fired, they ran at one another
and tried to pull members of the
other class over their own start line.
Freshmen often wore green cross
marks on their faces.

There were also proclama-
tions posted around the campus by
the sophomore class. Several of
these can be found in the Bucknell
archives. In 1908, the sophomore
class made one, addressing the
freshmen class as “Ye sophisticated
Clods of verdure,” proclaiming that
they must be in bed before seven
o'clock, contribute to a fund for
Soda water for the sophomore girls,
and their milk bottles must be ster-
ilized. The class of 191] said,
“Freshmen must shine shoes, run
errands, empty ‘gym’ buckets,
clean rooms, and make themselves
generally useful to Sophomores and
upperclassmen.”

The proclamation of the class
of 1913 read: See yourselves as
others see you...the infinitesimal,

wise heterogenous specimens of
pestiferous _parsites... pimps,

Freshman elected to top position |Let’s Do Lunch

With Julie Bachman and Steve Hoerter

of Key Club International

By Claire Davidson

Dee Bothelo, a freshman this
year at Bucknell, recently finished
her second term as a trustee of Key
Club International. Key Club is a
school service organization that
encourages involvement in the
community. It is completely run by
high school students and includes
more than 133,000 members in
more that 3,800 clubs in the United
States, Canada and 12 other
countries.

Dee became involved in Key
Club in Michigan, when her brother
who was a member of the club
brought her to one of théir local
meetings. She took an immediate
liking to the club and decided to
became a member herself. “I loved
it. It was so much fun.” However,
when Dee’s family moved to Man-
chester, New Hampshire, there was
no Key Club established in their
district. Dee therefore decide to
start a club with the help of a
nearby district.

In the summer before her jun-
ior year and her move to Manches-
ter, she decided to run for interna-
tional trustee. “As I knew I was
moving I couldn’t run for governor

of the district. Therefore I decided
to run for international trustee. I
didn’t want to stop serving,” she
explained. Dee was elected one of
14 trustees at the International Con-
vention in Anaheim, California.
The following year she was re-
elected at the convention in
Orlando, Florida

During her first year as trus-
tee she represented all of New Eng-
land and Michigan. In her second

term she represented East Canada,
the Caribbean Islands and Michi-
gan. “I was a link between the
international and district and state
levels,” explained Dee. She
attended district board meetings
where she would help the districts
run their particular club. “My job

to get people involved,” she
explained. She also had to make
sure that all the by laws were being
upheld in the constitution.

Dee’s involvement was not
just limited to the role of a trustee.
She also served on two committees;

she remarked. Dee also gave
speeches and held workshops, help-
ing to train the new and upcoming
leaders. “I ran educational activities

tee and the District Services com-
mittee. The purpose of the first
committee was to “plan the entire
program that the key club will be
run On next year,” commented Dee.
They were the group who were in

charge of creating the Key Club
theme which next year will be to
renew your committment to the
community and home and to main-
tain academics.

The second committee was in
charge of establishing programs to
help districts build their clubs, to
generally strengthen each individ-
ual district. They also judged mem-
bers of the Key Clubs for outstand-
ing officer awards, an honor which
Dee received herself for outstand-
ing board member.

For Dee, the advantages of
being involved in Key Club far out-
weigh any disadvantages. “The
only disadvantage was that it took a
lot of time. I had to make a lot of
sacrifices for Key Club but they
were well worth the benefits I
received,” commented Dee.

Dee explained that the num-
ber of people she met and got to
talk with was the biggest advantage.
“I even got to learn how to give
speeches to an audience of 2500
people.” She has traveled all over
the world, to such places as China,
Canada, Aruba, the Bahamas, Ber-
muda and all across the United
States. “I met all these people
whose goal was to serve. Ali the
people I met was an incredible
experience that I will never forget,”
she explained.

Dee’s goal now is to go to
law school. She has a double major
in political science and education
and is also taking courses in history
and English. “I mostly want to keep
up my GPA,” she commented. Dee
also hopes to get involved with The
Bucknellian, the yearbook and the
literary magazine.

Animal Behavior professor abuzz
with information about bees

By Jen Marshall

Professor David J. Fletcher,
of Animal Behavior Studies, I was
sure had an impressive collection of
deadly killer bees and ferocious fire
ants. I imagined his basement to be
filled with menacing hives and
carefully locked ant farms. With
these frightful images in mind, I
excitedly set out to interview this

bug-friend of a professor. After a
few wrong turns, I located his
office—B10 of Coleman Hall. It
was empty. Hearing voices in the
next office, I ventured across the
hall. I asked the man sitting there if
he was Professor Fletcher. He said
“no.” “Great,” I thought, “He for-
got that I was coming and now I’m
not going to have an article and my
editor is going to hate me...” The

“am David Fletcher. Let’s go into

him back to B10, ready to conduct

act like a happy guest on The

a stinger bigger than your last mea-
sles vaccination, The thought of
these monsters on campus would
inspire fear in any football player’s
heart. Professor Fletcher wants
everyone to know that there ARE
NOT any “killer bees” at or near
Bucknell. The bees that he keeps in
harmless hives in his lab are mere
honeybees. Real “killer bees” are
truely called the “African bee.”
These bees are smaller than the
honeybee and their sting would
hardly cause instant death. There
is, however, reason to fear the
African bee’s eventual migration
into North America.

The African bee was brought
to South America for research pur-
Poses some years ago. Recently, 26
colonies accidentally escaped and
have been travelling north. These
bees are expected to reach the
lower states by the summer of
1991. If the African bee is harm-
less, then why are we concerned?
Nine to nineteen million dollars of
american agriculture relies on the
controlled use of bees for pollina-
tion. The African bee does not lend
itself to pollination. People can
work alongside the honeybee with
a relatively low risk of being stung,
but the same is not true of the Afri-
can bee. The African bee, although
Not poisonous, is extremely agres-
sive. Workers would be continu-
ally stung and the agricultural bal-
ance would be upset. If the African
bee population displaces the hon-
eybee population, then commercial
beekeepers and American farmers
would be in trouble. Obviously,
action has to be taken.

Professor Fletcher is not only
a professor at Bucknell, he is co-
chairperson of The Beekeeping
Advisory Board of Pennsylvania.
The problem of the African bee
migration is of high interest to him.

cussed, and all agree that action
will be taken on a state level. Any-
one interested in fine detail of the
African bee problem can read a
book that is co-edited by Professor
Fletcher himself. The book, as of
now untitled, will be published
soon.

As Professor Fletcher ex-
plained all of this to me, I forgave
him for his earlier lack of enthu-
siasm. He probably thought that I
was going to write a sensationalist
article worthy of The National
Enquirer. Admittedly, | had vague
ideas in that general direction, but
after my interview with Professor
Fletcher, I saw that the issue
deserved a lot more respect. Profes-
sor Fletcher has devoted a number
of years to the study of the social
evolutions of ants and bees. He has
lived in Africa, teaching at the Uni-
versity of Natal in South Africa. He
DID have fire ants at Bucknell
some time ago, but fire ants don’t
like Pennsylvania. It’s too cold for
them. Professor Fletcher had to give
them away to a colleauge at the
University of Texas. What a Christ-
mas present.

To the Editor:

A curious thing happened last

well. We, P.O.W.E.R., placed vari-
Ous quotations between the library
and the Langone Center last
Wednesday, all of which were
taken from the written remains of
many famous men. The reason we
did this is not to insult anyone’s
intelligence and assume that stu-
dents had not known that these men
had, to a twentieth-century mind,
many faults, but rather to highlight
them in order to show what our col-
lective history is. The words we
copied are not generally placed in
standard textbooks on philosophy
nor italicized in works of literature
by the editor; they are easy to miss.
One reason it is so simple to disre-
gard such misogynist sentiments is
because we seem to be so quick to
explain it all away with statements

such as: he was only saying what
everyone else from his era was say-
ing; he was actually more progres-
sive than the others; you can’t
judge a sixteenth-century man with
twentieth-century values. And

Fetal Protection safeguards industry...Finally

Policy is a means of preventing birth defect litigation—not discriminating against women

By Mark Leister
Staff Writer

An issue laden with the tradi-
tionally weighted language of dis-
crimination and rights of the
unborn recently entered the realm
of the highest court in our nation.
The exact nature of the case is that
of fetal protection in industry and,
following on the heels of the ever-
heated abortion issue, the sides are
digging in for a fight.

There can be no denying the
importance of the issue—it has the
potential to impact nearly 20 mil-
lion jobs and affect nearly a fifth of
the blue-collar work force. Women,
aged eighteen to fifty-five who can
bear children, could be forced from
industrial positions that are deemed
high health risks to any future chil-
dren the woman may bear.

The specific case revolves
around Johnson Controls’ present
policy of excluding women of
childbearing age from its factory
because of high lead concentrations
in its plant. The Milwaukee-based
car-battery manufacturer has found
it wiser to exclude women and risk
discrimination suits than to open its
doors to the many liability claims
that arise from -associated birth
defects.

The opposition, primarily
female employees and the National
Organization of Women (N.O.W.),
has deemed this policy discrimina-
tory and lacking in scientific valid-
ity. It claims that this standard is an
unjustified means of excluding
women from the higher paying
industrial-level jobs. What it is, in
reality, is an effort to finally protect
industry from unnecessary
litigation.

So...do we make an effort to
protect the manufacturers from law-
suits, women from discrimination,
or fetuses from birth defects? For
the purpose of this issue, I contend
that first and foremost, the rights of
the fetus are irrelevant and the
Supreme Court will probably
agree—why? Precedent. 3

First, our courts have been

unable to decide exactly what to do
about the rights
of the unborm.
The nation is
already in a
quandary — over
Roe v. Wade and
its relevance to
many issues; the
Court is certainly
not going to
write an opinion
that will under-
mine that still
undecided case.

Second,
this case does not
hinge on the
issue of morals;
it is an issue of
law, and that, I
believe, is what
the Justices will
address. The
question is
straightforward;
is the exclusion
of women from a certain division
of industry to curb costly birth
defect litigation appropriate? For
these reasons, the Supreme Court
will probably avoid the fetal rights
question at all costs and instead
focus on the battle between manu-
facturers and women. But there’s a
twist.

There is no substantiated link
between the production of eggs and
sperm and the disorders associated
with lead. Therefore, it is important
to realize that men, whose sperm
contribute only genetic material to
the fetus, cannot be considered at
risk.

However, women, in whom
the entire developmental process
Occurs, are at risk, because damag-

ing levels of lead can be passed
from the mother to the fetus. And
seemingly little can be done to alle-
viate that risk. The Occupational
Safety and Health Act (O.S.H.A)
has brought about firm standards
for safe lead levels in industry.
These levels, which are far from
harmful to adult humans, are well
above the safe range for fetuses.

I tried to kiss her she started
sneezing!

First Guy: Duuuuuude?!?

Second Guy: I can’t wait to
do it again tonight!

First Guy: Are ya gonna play
Heave And Leave?

Second Guy: Yeahhhhhh

This aspect of the issue has
sparked debate as well. If levels
can be lowered to within the adult
safe-range, why can’t the manufac-
turers be forced to lower them to
meet levels safe for fetuses as well?
The National Association of Manu-
facturers has the answers.

First, industry has already
met the O.S.H.A. standards which
were very costly. Plus, the factory

divisions in ques-
tion had high lead
concentrations to
begin §with—that
was the nature of
the problem. For
instance, the man-
ufacturing _pro-
cess of car batter-
ies requires steps
that expose work-
ers to large quan-
tities of lead. It
would be incon-
ceivable, if not
entirely impossi-
ble, to lower the
levels to fetus-
safe standards.
Second, if
the levels could
be reduced, they
would be very
costly, and unless
the levels were
absolutely _ negli-
gible, suits could still be filed. It
would require the near eradication
of lead in the workplace to protect
the company against birth defect
litigation.

Finally, there is the question
of to whom the manufacturer has
the greatest responsibility. The
company employs adults, not
fetuses; it should not be forced to

_lMy platform is

re}

tailor its production to fetal health
levels. It should be required to pro-
mote the health of the individuals it
originally hired. Worker safety and
fetal safety cannot be considered
synonymous.

But the companies have not
been completely uncaring. They
have tried to work with their female
employees. They claim that they
have tried to eliminate the quarrel-
some elements of their policy by
encouraging voluntary relocation.
General Motors (G.M.) imple-
mented a five-year program some
years ago, that entitled anyone to
work in the company’s high-lead
areas—with one request. They
encouraged their childbearing-
aged female employees to transfer
to other, less hazardous, sections of
the plant if they were planning
families.

How successful was this pro-
gram? Moderate (at best). G.M.
reported that over the five years,
there were six pregnancies in the
high-lead division—one of which
resulted in a fetus with severe birth
defects and a barrage of costly
litigation.

It is for this exact reason that
the manufacturers have begun to
implement policies such as the one
before the Supreme Court. Compa-
nies must have a means of protect-
ing themselves from the costly liti-
gations arising from lead-related
birth defects. If there were another
way to guarantee that such lawsuits
would not surface, I’m sure the fac-
tories would accept it; since no
such options are presently availa-
ble, the exclusion from hazardous
high-lead workplaces of fertile,
childbearing-aged women should
be permitted.

The lights of Memphis still
look bright for “Little Feat”

By Jon Elliott
Staff Writer

Friday night Davis Gym and
all who were present experienced a
performance which is difficult to
describe in words. The energy and
music which flowed through the
guitars, drums, bongos and mando-
lins of Warner Bros. recording art-
ists Little Feat will be felt for quite
some time on Bucknell’s campus.

At a point in the university’s
history when campus-wide social
events are few and far between, the

Bucknell Concert Committee suc-
cessfully provided a glimmer of
hope in a sea of general student
apathy and discontent. To see more
than two thousand fans, both young
and old, singing along to such Lit-
ue Feat classics as “Fat Man In the
Bathtub” and “Oh, Atlanta” was a
pleasant sight for fans to see and
surely for the band as well.

After the nearly six hours of
stage set-up, and an exciting sound
check which included “Rad
Gumbo” and a obscure version of
“Sailin’ Shoes,” I had the fortunate

Little Feat has had an excellent career thus far and continues down
the road to success with their next album coming out in August.

Dozens of courses are being offered by the Craft Shop. These courses
range from learning to use a loom to making pottery on a wheel.

opportunity to be able to sit down
with drummer and original band
member Richie Hayward and dis-
cuss the many things which have
made Feat tick for so many years.
This opportunity only came after a
quite a bit of waiting in order to
receive permission for the inter-
view from the appropriate
managers.

Hayward, sitting at a make-
shift banquet table in the weight
room annex of Davis Gym,
answered my questions with the
flare and enthusiasm of a starry
eyed newcomer being interviewed
by Barbara Walters. I began by
observing that Little Feat has run
the gamut of live performances,
from headlining a show, to opening
for the Grateful Dead, to playing in
front of almost three thousand col-
lege kids in Lewisburg, Pa. Simul-
taneously, the band has been able
to keep up an energy-filled perfor.
mance surpassed by few, and I was
curious as to how the band main-
tains such energy and good spirits.
Hayward résponded by saying “We
just do it. There’s no secret. It’s not
bad.”

And that’s the way Hayward
spoke throughout our conversation:
soft, sincere and to the point. He
said what was on his mind, and
unlike many rock stars of today
was not caught up in the hype of
being a big star. He seemed to
enjoy the idea that what he and the
late Lowell George started twenty
years ago is still strong enough to
be of interest to fans both young
and old. Hayward continued by
responding that Feat has been on
the road since April 26 and expects
to finish the Representing the
Mambo tour in mid-November.

Little Feat’s history has been
a roller coaster ride of ups and
downs, and Hayward feels the
group is stronger and “better now

Little Feat percussionist/conga player Sam Clayton put on an excellent performance last Friday night.

than we have ever been. The future
looks very promising. And we
intend to keep going for years.
Until our minds make promises that
our bodys can’t fill.”

Hayward explained to me
that Little Feat decided to re-group,
after a nearly nine year hiatus
because they “missed playing
together. And now we’re free to do
more. Not because we needed to
pay the rent. It was just time to get
together and give it a go. It’s a
drummers dream.”

As a proliferate Rock and
Roll drummer, Hayward’s child-
hood musical influences revealed
what his performances reflect on
stage. As a purist, it was not sur-
prising to hear him say the Big
Bands, Jazz, and the Blues molded
the way that he plays today. Hear-
ing Hayward mention people like

Count Basie, Miles Davis, Ray
Charles and Muddy Waters as indi-
viduals whom he admired growing
up enabled me to link Hayward’s
bright past with his even brighter
future

We wound up the rather intri-
guing and me
with an off-the-cuff conversation
about sponsorship of big name
groups by major corporations. His
views on the recent “sell-outs” by
the Rolling Stones and the Who
were quite surprising. He didn’t
mind the idea that Mick and the
boys were being sponsored by Bud-
weiser saying “I don’t care. It’s
business. Just as long as the corpo-
ration isn’t harmful, like Dupont, or
something like that. I wouldn’t
mind being sponsored, it would
mean more money in my pocket,
it’s just that nobody has asked us.

ngful conversation

It’s a business.”

Richie Hayward not only
keeps the beat to one of the liveliest
rock bands around today, but at 44
years old, he also speaks with the
flare, spunk and naive optimism of
a college freshman. Now entering
their third decade on vinyl and on
tour, Hayward says that Little Feat
iS Just as strong and possibly even
stronger than they were in the ’70s
with George at the helm.

Upon completion of this tour
in November, Little Feat expects to
take a short break and plans on
going back into the studio to stan
working on their third album since
regrouping in 1988. Hayward
explained that the group has some
of their new material down on
paper already, and that they hope
the new album will be released in
August of next year.

Craft Shop opens down under

By Lydia G. Neuman

Anyone who has ever applied
his or her hands and brains to a
material to make something, write
something or produce something
from nothing and experienced joy
through this process, should iden-
tify with Langdon Warner’s state-
ment, “knowledge of natural pro-
cesses is the very basis of all arts
which transform raw materials into
artifacts. Possession of the myster-
ies of a craft means nothing less
than a power over nature gods and
it creates a priest out of the man
who controls it.”

The relocation of the Craft
Shop to the ground floor of Hunt
Hall is facing delays of what may
amount to several weeks. Craft
Shop director Molly Ross praised
the efforts of the physical plant in
aiding the move and hopes the
delay will not mean that classes—
many of which are already full—
will have to be rescheduled.
Although the new site in Hunt is
preferable to some of the other pos-
sibilities—the boonies of the obser-
vatory, to name one remote sugges-
tion—the program will suffer from
the loss of the centrality offered by
the UC.

According to Ross, last year’s
open forums to discuss the matter
of relocation were well-attended by
both students and members of the
community on behalf of the Craft
Shop. Yet for some reason, an array
of craft opportunities has been dis-

After facing problems of all shapes and sizes, the Craft Sho
Hall. Although the location is less than desireable, it is gi

placed from an already insufficient
space to one that is even less
adequate.

The electrical system in
Hunt—a building in which hair-
dryers are outlawed—is incapable
of supplying the power needed to
run all four pottery wheels at the
same time. The lack of any exhaust
system at all makes the use of kilns
an impossibility, and means that no
ceramic work can be fired. Enroll-
ment in pottery classes has already
overflowed beyond capacity; wait-
ing lists had to be started on the

very first day of registration.

Against the odds, the Craft
Shop has thrived since Ross ini-
lated the venture eighteen years
ago. Seventy-four students enrolled
in a wide variety of classes and
workshops during the 1990 January
Program and Ross feels confident
that current delays are minor and
Says they should not stop anyone
from registering and seeking
information

Over the years, the program
has retained an identity that is sep-
arate from the Art Department,

those who are experienced or seri-

The energy of the Craft

Kaufman’s presence is not new to
the Bucknell campus. Last fall she
choreographed “Angels Fear to
Tread” for the Bucknell Dance
Company’s winter performance.
This piece illustrated her ability to
enrich and expand the existing
dance program at Bucknell.

Kaufman is returning this
semester to teach three dance
courses: Ballet I, Modern I and
Modern II. She is also working
with the Dance Company, choreo-
graphing and dancing in pieces
slated for this year’s winter
performance.

Chris Kaufman has spent the
last five years in New York danc-
ing with such artists as Ralph Len-
non and Kenneth Rinker. She has
performed at The Dance Theater
Workshop in pieces which she per-
sonally choreographed. These are

they’re not really brothers, but this
doesn’t seem to have hindered their
success. In fact, the Flying Karama-
zov Brothers are anything but
unsuccessful.

The group has made quite a
name for itself through itsnational
and international _ performances.
They have made several appear-
ances on NBC’s “Today,” “The Pat
Sajak Show,” “Late Night with
Joan Rivers,” and “Merv Griffin.”
The group has also put on their
own specials on Showtime and
PBS. Their PBS special won an
Emmy for Outstanding Entertain-
ment Programming.

Other performances have
ranged from participation in the
Edinburgh International Theatre
Festival (not once, but three times)
and two appearances at the Hong
Kong International Festival of Art.
The Flying Karamazov Brothers

have also had two successful runs
on Broadway, and co-starred in the
hit movie, “The Jewel of the Nile.”

So, “Why,” you ask, “are
these successful performers coming
to Lewisburg?” It seems to me that
their appearance tomorrow night at
8:30 p.m. in the Weis Center has
something to do with some good
planning here on campus. The Fly-
ing Karamazov Brothers should
definitely appeal to your younger
brothers and sisters, your parents,
and who knows, Bucknellians,
maybe you too will enjoy a differ-
ent sort of Saturday night entertain-
ment for a change! This perform-
nace definitely looks like
something worth checking into. So,
for all of you students who are
lucky enough to have your parents
here for the weekend, good luck
and don’t forget to enjoy
yourselves!

Ibsen’s

By Karen McCann

The Department of Theatre
and Dance announces the first pro-
duction of its 1990-91 season, Ros-
mersholm, by Henrik Ibsen. Set in
19th Century Norway, the story
centers on a man and a woman
drawn together by hopes of a future
liberated from the
restrictions of
their times. Their
efforts are under-
mined by past
secrets, inner
voices and politi-
cal realities which drive them to
bold action at the play’s Startling
conclusion.

Robert Gainer, Director of
Rosmersholm and Chair of the
Department of Theatre and Dance,
adds, “This play marks a turning
point in Ibsen’s playwriting career.
The author begins to explore how
human existence is defined both by

General

the tensions in our public lives and
in our innermost private realms.
Rosmersholm’s protagonists’ lives
are shaped by the disturbing social
Pressures around them, as well as
the complex psychological realities
that confront them from within. It
is a challenging and rewarding play
to realize for both the director and

Ghost was absolutely boo-tiful

Yes, yes; it is I once again.
No stop, you’re too kind. Well,
enough of the formalities; let’s
get down to business: movie
reviews, those fiendish capsules
that are supposed to tell you, the
reader, whether a movie (that
you’ ve probably already seen any-
way) is worth seeing. Kind of
pointless and condescending,
don’t you think? But, for those of
you who just can’t get enough and
have devoted your lives to read-

The movie that I took in this

Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore

when Sam (Swayze) is murdered,
his spirit stays in the physical world
to protect Molly (Moore). The
movie’s plot revolves around
Sam’s discovering the motives
behind his murder and solving not
only that crime, but a money-
laundering racket in the bank he
worked in.

Personally, on the surface I
thought that this sounded like the
dumbest idea for a movie since The
Stuff (which was about killer ice
cream). I mean let’s be honest, who
wants tO see a supernatural com-
edy, suspense, whodunit, love story
that takes place on the ethereal
plane? Not me, said I. However...

Patrick Swayze just dirty
danced his way into my heart, as
did Demi Moore who cried more
tears than Tammy Bakker, but
always at the right moment.

Men’s soccer tops Army, falls to TSU

Bison face critical Patriot League test at Lafayette tomorrow

By Chad Bown
Staff Writer

Following the men’s soccer
team’s 3-1 victory over Army last
Saturday, Ken Gulick ‘91
explained, “We came out with our

heads into the game.” When the
Bison come out firing and manage
to play a solid first half, they gener-
ally win the ball game, as their 8-3
record indicates. Such was the case
versus the visiting Army squad, but
the exception proved true in a very

Calvin Hill speaks
at Weis Center

By Mark Abrahamsen
Staff Writer

Former National Football
League Rookie of the Year Calvin
Hill presented a public lecture last
Sunday in the Weis Center. The
presentation, attended by approxi-
mately 250 Bucknell students, was
focused primarily on the evils of
drugs and alcohol in all phases of
the sports arena.

Hill, a 1969 Yale graduate,
was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys
out of college and had many super-
lative years as one of the finest
wide receivers in the NFL. When
Hill first started witnessing athletes
taking drugs in the early 1970’s, he
never gave it much thought to it, as
amphetamines and marajuana were
thought of as popular, “recrea-
tional” drugs of the times.

On a Monday night game the
Cowboys were in Texas Stadium

when Hill noticed a peculiar ban-
ner in the stands. “South Amer-
ica's Team” said the sign, and the
message perceived to Hill was that
the public seemed to know that
many of the Cowboys were sub-
stance abusers. This helped "wake
up" Hill to know that there was a
problem of drug use within the
franchise.

For the majority of the lec-
ture, he spoke primarily about
alcohol, and how its affect can be
detrimental to the body and mind.
Hill presented an eight-point test to
help one determine if a friend were
an alcoholic, while emphasizing
the idea that one should think of
the consequences when he or she
decides to drink.

Hill is currently a career
planning advisor/drug counselor
for the Cleveland Browns, and he
speaks at different college cam-
puses whenever possible.

Crew acquires varsity
status, buys new boats

By Amanda Kessler

The Bucknell crew team is
enjoying its first season under var-
sity status. The team now has the
advantages of other varsity sports
and is continuously upgrading its
program. The seasen got off to a
flying start with the purchase of two
new Vespoli shells, which will
allow the team to compete at a
higher level than it had in previous
seasons. This new equipment, along
with a growing student interest in
the sport will hopefully result in an
increased achievement record for
the Bucknell crew team.

Many novice men and
women came out for the sport this
fall. They are hard at work, not only
learning how to row, but also
understanding the large amount of
dedication crew asks from the indi-
vidual. Rowers rise at 5 a.m. on
numerous mornings of the week,
have practice, and return to campus

before most Bucknellians even hear
the ring of their alarms. Certainly it
is the sport for the morning person
and the undedicated are quickly
weeded out.

The crew team will celebrate
its varsity status tomorrow during
Parents’ Weekend. All parents of
rowers are invited down to the
landing for a barbeque and the
christening of the new Vespolis.
Scheduled to speak at the event are
Head Coach John Skotedis, crew
President Robert Hinton, 1989
men’s captain Andrew Schoudel,
and tentatively, Rick Hartzell,
Bucknell Director of Athletics.

All boats will row in demon-
stration races to introduce the par-
ents to the Bucknell crew program.
Following the rowing demonstra-
tion, the team will sponsor an infor-
mal lunch for all parents and row-
ers. The events are expected to
begin at 9:30 a.m., and should end
by noon.

Strange game on Tuesday versus
Towson State.

Army and the Bison played
before an estimated 970 people last
Saturday at the East Field. Bucknell
exerted its dominance from the out-
set, and almost scored on their first
possession, when Brandon Poe ’91
lofted a crossing pass that Jon
Mackenzie °93 headed just wide of
the Army net.

Bucknell did manage to capi-
talize just 5:16 into the game when
a Mackenzie cross took a crazy hop
past Cadet keeper Rich Pellegrini
right to a waiting Gulick, who
promptly headed it into a wide-
open net for a quick 1-0 advantage.

The Bison kept the pressure
on, and just two minutes later Terry
Pelino ’91 led an attack through the
heart of the Army defense and then,
with a nifty pass, hit a streaking
Gulick who knocked a shot past
Pellegrini for his second goal of the
contest.

At that point in the match
Army finally settled down and
managed to generate some offense
of their own, The Bucknell defense
seemed a little out of sync without
the injured Chad Hellman 92, but
keeper Scott Racek *91 made up
the difference with an outstanding
first half in which he had several
fine saves.

Pelino added some more
insurance at 32:00 when he took a
Gulick pass and hit a screamer into
the Army net for a 3-0 halftime
lead.

Army’s Branden Carteen
broke up the shutout bid with a sec-
ond half goal past keeper Mark
Wrigley ’94, but the Bison defense
tightened up and managed to hang
on for the victory.

“It was a good win,” indi-
cated Coach Reynolds, “but I have
some reservations because we were
outplayed in the last 35 to 40 min-
utes. Our first half was good in that
we had several opportunities to
score, and we stuck it in the net.”

Gulick, who scored his team-
leading sixth and seventh goals in
the contest, as well as adding an
assist, had this to say about his
club’s strong start this season:
“We've got a really good squad this
year all the way up and down the
field. We’re strong at most every
position, and we’ve got good team

chemistry. Also, we’ve really come
together as a unit this year.”

The Bison hosted Towson
State on Tuesday for a non-
conference game with their old
ECC rivals. Pelino voiced the
team’s confusion and _frustation
with the 1-0 loss stating, “It was a
game where we played as well as
we have all season, in fact, I think
we dominated much of the
contest.”

“We did a lot of things well,
and it was actually one of our best
totally complete games of the sea-
son,” stated Reynolds. “But, you’ve
got to look at the wins and losses in

this game.”

Bucknell played an excep-
tional first half, and did everything
they needed to do, except put the
ball in the net. The Bison’s best
scoring opportunity came when
Alex Kogan °94 took a shot that hit
off the crossbar, and rebounded
right back to Bucknell, but the team
faltered in its second attempt as
well.

The second half opened and
found itself being very similar to
the first 45 minutes. With the wet
grass, both teams found it difficult
to make quick cuts and changes of
direction, so the play was noticea-

lt te aie

bly slower. Both teams applied sub-
Stantial pressure, but Bucknell had
the best opportunities to score. Yet,
on this day, some golden second
half attempts by Brandon Poe '91,
Kogan, and Dan D’Angelo ’92 all
found themselves just wide of the
net. Frustration was evident on both
sides as there was a lot of finger
pointing, minor penalties, yellow
cards, and bickering with the ref-
eree. Unfortunately, Towson took
advantage of the frustrated Bison
and found the opportunity they
were looking for when the Buck-

Field hockey thrashed by Penn State
after victories over Lehigh, LaSalle

By Scooter Van Kirk and
Julie McCausland
Staff Writers

The field hockey team trav-
eled to Penn State yesterday, where
it succumbed 9-0 to the Nittany
Lions. Penn State, a national pow-
erhouse ranked #2 in the country,
had little trouble with the Lady
Bison. Bucknell drops to 3-9 this
season, while Penn State raises its
record to 10-1, with its only defeat
coming to Old Dominion. This loss
snapped the Lady Bison’s two-
game winning streak of the previ-
ous weekend, where they notched
their first conference win.

Few things could have ‘gone
wrong for the Lady Bison last
weekend, as they defeated Lehigh
and La Salle with a resurgent
offensive effort supplemented by
their ever-ready defense. On Satur-
day the Lady Bison rolled over
Patriot League member Lehigh 3-1,
notching their first league victory
this season, as their record stands at
1-3 in the conference. Sunday the
Lady Bison shutout a struggling La
Salle team 1-0.

In addition to these two wins,
forward Almyra Baldwin ’94 was
named Patriot League Player of the
Week for her impressive role in
both wins.

Tt was a long week for Buck-
nell, who weathered a twelve hour
road-trip to Cornell just a day

before the long weekend. At Cor-
nell the Lady Bison were forced to
adjust their ranks due to the loss of
key starters Meghan Clark ’92 and
speedy forward Alison Arth °93.
The Lady Bison fell to the Big Red
2-0, but were undaunted as they
came into their league game against
Lehigh.

Bucknell ended a three-week
offensive drought with a barrage of
shots on goal as well as many well-
played opportunities. The multitude
of shots, which resulted in the long
sought goals, were generated by an
attack which coach Averill termed
“remorseless.”

The relentless Lady Bison
notched 35 shots to their oppo-
nents’ 16 and nearly doubled
Lehigh’s 7 offensive corners with
12 of their own. Bucknell’s
repeated offensive  onslaughts
resulted in two scores after shots
were rebounded off the goalie.

Early in the game a bee-line
drive from Sue Wells ’93
rebounded off the Lehigh goal-
tender and was followed through
by Stephanie Carfley *93 to put
Bucknell on the scoreboard. Less
than thirty seconds later, the Lehigh
goalie was again beat by Wells.

Wells collected her own
rebound to score the second goal of
the game for the Lady Bison. She
assessed, “Our offense didn’t give

The aggressive play was still
not over for the Bucknell attack, as
Almira Baldwin scored giving the
Lady Bison a three-goal advantage
into halftime.

Lehigh managed a goal in the
last ten minutes of the second half
from Laurie Leigh-Manuel. Except
for this defensive lapse the Lady
Bison played a solid game on both
ends of the field.

Once again the defense was
anchored by stalwart goalie
Danielle Ward "93, who recorded

Former hoops star Leggett 90 {NCAA institutes new
joins the European pro ranks

By Chris Drowne

Almost every _ basketball
player from CYO league to the col-
legiate ranks dreams of playing
professionally. For former Buck-
nell basketball star Greg Leggett
"90, this dream became a reality
this past summer when he signed a
one-year contract with the Union
Gmunden Basketball Club in
Austria.

Leggett, a co-captain of last
year’s Breakin’ Bison, will receive
a $1,000 monthly salary, an apart-
ment, a car, and possible incentive
bonuses based on individual and
team play.

In his first article of a
monthly column for his home-
town’s newspaper in Vienna, Vir-
ginia, Leggett wrote, “I’m still hav-
ing a hard time believing that I’m
actually getting paid to play basket-
ball! It’s a good feeling.”

Gmunden is one of nine
teams in Austria’s two-division
league which begins play in mid-
October. Each team is allowed one
American, but some players give
up their United States citizenship
status to play for a team that
already has an American on its ros-
ter. Leggett and former Temple
Owl Mike Vreeswyk are the lone
Americans for their respective
clubs.

As far as the caliber of play,
Leggett compares it to “(Colle-
giate) Division II, but everyone
plays hard and the league is said to
be tough.”

Keith Fenton °91, former
teammate of Leggett and co-captain
of this year’s Bucknell basketball
team said, ““Greg’s overall skills for
a player his size (6’6”, 198 Ibs.) are

Women’s soccer crushes

By Anne Taback
Staff Writer

The soccer season is about
half over, and Bucknell’s Lady
Bison celebrated with a smashing
10-3 win over the Temple Owls.
The team has been steadily improv-
ing since its first game, and as a
first year varsity squad, they have
come a long way.

Coach Toby Lovecchio is
encouraged and optimistic about
his team’s success. “We’re at the
point now where I thought we’d be
and we’ve done pretty much what I
thought we’d do in terms of work-
ing up to certain levels as time
went on. Now we can really com-
pete against the teams we’re up
against.”

He feels that everyone on the
team has improved greatly, stating,
“In the beginning, we could hardly
even head the ball, we weren’t
Stringing together passes, we
weren’t playing good defense...
from that first day everything has
improved. The girls’ confidence
level has increased, we have a
couple of wins, we’ve stayed in
some games that we possibly could
have won.”

Lovecchio hopes the team
will stay at the level it is at and
keep getting better. Lovecchio has
been trying to teach them “soccer
sense,” almost a sixth sense about
what to do on the field that only
comes from playing. “The more
they play, the more they’ll get that
soccer sense and the more they’ll
be able to do things on the field by
second nature. You just know what
to do and when to do it, to think
before you get the ball... and when
you do that and go up against a
team that doesn’t, you win. That’s
the difference when we go up
against teams that are better than
us—teams that were able to do
things a lot smoother than we were
able to do but we’re getting there.

well suited for the European style
of play.”

Leggett joins ex-teammates
John Watson (England) and Bo
Heiden (Finland) as Bucknell
alumni playing basketball in the
European leagues. He became the
twelfth player to play profession-
ally after playing for head coach
Charlie Woollum. “All of the
European teams are looking for
skilled players 6’6” and taller,”
said Woollum. “We (the United
States) have a great deal of talented
big men that they lack in Europe.”

Al Leslie, Bucknell’s all-time
scoring leader, was selected by the
Indiana Pacers in the second round
of the 1981 NBA draft. Other
Bucknell players who played in
Europe are Jaye Andrews, Bob
Barry, Deb Okorodudu, Mike
Page, Ed and Steve Sigl, and David
Shehadi.

The non-German speaking
ex-Bison will spend the next eight
months in Gmunden, a Northen
Austrian resort city located about
25 miles from Salzberg. So far he
has managed to keep himself busy
by traveling throughout Austria,
golfing, partying, and dining out
with his new teammates. Leggett,
who is understandably enjoying his
Stay, said, “This place is beautiful.
The food is fantastic! I haven’t yet
cooked a meal in my apartment.”

With all the distractions,
Leggett has still managed to play a
little basketball while in Austria.
In fact, he has impressed the team’s
general manager enough to have
them pay for his girlfriend to come
over and visit. A four-year letter-
man at Bucknell, Leggett compiled
an impressive basketball resume,
compiling 1,142 career points in

The girls are great. Being the ener-
getic and hardworking group that
they are, they're trying to do it...
they’re very coachable.”

Obviously everyone’s efforts
are paying off. Although Temple is
a club team and does not count in
the standings, it was a big victory
for the Lady Bison. The offense
was extremely good, exploding for
a total of 10 goals.

The first goal of the game
was scored by Bucknell at 2:00,
when forward Tina Fields ’94 was
standing six yards away from the
goal and, on a beautiful cross by
midfielder Kathy Ott ’91, put the
ball in the back of the net with a
header. Temple followed up with a
quick goal at 3:00 after a scramble
in front of the net.

After a cross from midfielder
Mandy Head '93, forward Amy
Krause ’91 gave Bucknell the lead
once again at 7:35. However, Tem-
ple tied it up once again at 8:40
with a shot above the head of goal-
keeper Jessica Livingston ’92.

Midfielder Janine Hudson
"92 scored the next goal for the
Lady Bison at 15:15, and although
Temple scored once more at 20:30,
it was their last goal. Midfielder
Alyssa Meade 91 converted on a
pass from Hudson to score at 28:10
in the first half and midfielder Ou
scored the next two goals assisted
by Hudson and Fields.

The Lady Bison continued
their stampede after halftime, when
they scored four more times. The
sixth goal came at 55:15 when
Fields took a shot which rebounded
off the Temple goalkeeper and
Krause was there to follow it up.
Hudson scored the next goal unas-
sisted at 75:00.

At 80:20, Head passed the
ball to forward Chris O’Lare ’92,
who converted on the midfield pass
for the ninth goal. The tenth and
last goal of the game for the Lady
Bison came with less than eight

minutes left in the game when
defender Nicola Stojak ’92 crossed
from the left to Meade, who took a
shot about six yards out for the
goal.

Goalkeeper Livingston
played an excellent game, compil-
ing nine saves. Livingston had pre-
viously decided that she wasn’t
happy playing soccer and that she
was going to take a break from the
team. Since both first and second
suring goalkeepers were injured,
Lovecchio called her and asked if
she would play in net against Tem-
ple. Livingston agreed, came to
Practice last Friday, and helped the
Lady Bison get their victory.

Lovecchio feels that as the
game went on, the defense played
tougher than in the beginning and
that made all the difference.

“They played excellent soc-
cer in the last twenty minutes of the
first half and the full forty five min-
utes in the second half. The big dif-
ference in the game was that we
were in much better condition; our
physical fitness was much better
than theirs. We were stringing
together passes, finalizing them
with good opportunities and then
converting those opportunities.”

The Lady Bison are begin-
ning to play better as a team. “The
last two days of practice were the
best I’ve seen all year,” said Lovec-
chio. “They’re knocking the ball
well, moving well, playing good,
aggressive defense and I think their
attitude is such that they’re feeling
better about themselves and it
shows when they’re on the field.”

Hudson added, “Up to this
point our offense has been minimal,
this time we scored a lot of goals.
We seem more unified now than in
the beginning of the season... we’re
becoming more of a team now.
We’re coming together and getting
to know each other a lot better...
it'll be a promising season next
year. I’m optimistic, I think we’ll

over in Europe,” added Fenton.
“He said that he only plans to play
this season and then return to the
United States.”

Whether this is his last sea-
son of playing or not, Greg Leggett
has already achieved the dream of
millions of basketball players
around the world.

Temple

come out with a decent season this
year, though.”

However, the loss of last
Wednesday’s game against
Bloomsburg was disappointing. The
Lady Bison played extremely well
in the first 20 minutes.

Early in the game, Krause
took the ball from one of the
defenders, passing it to Fields who
rocketed an eight yard shot into the
net.

The Huskies retaliated, coun-
terattacking and finally tying the
score with a comer kick that got
past goalkeeper Stojak. The Lady
Bison continued to play well in the
second half, winning a lot of the 50-
50 balls and playing good defense.

Unfortunately, Bloomsburg
capitalized on a ball that hit a bump
in the field and flew over one of the
Bucknell defenders. The Lady
Bison were unable to score after
that and the final score of the game
was 2-1.

Hudson summarized it well,
saying that “we dominated most of
the game, we just couldn’t get it in
the net as much as we needed to.”
The last time they played Blooms-
burg, the Lady Bison were defeated
4-1, according to Lovecchio, “it
was a game we could have won.
We played pretty good soccer.”

Although it lost to Blooms-
burg, the team is keeping the Tem-
ple victory in mind and is looking
forward to clashing with the Blue
Jays tomorrow.

Co-captain Christina Baselga
"91 had to get stitches after getting
hit in the face with the ball at
Bloomsburg and will not play.

Elizabethtown is a Division
Ill powerhouse, ranked in the top
20 nationwide.

However, Lovecchio is opti-
mistic about his team’s success: “I
think we'll be ready for Elizabeth-
town,” he said. “If we can contain a
couple of their key players we can
play with them.”

drug-testing policy

By Mark Abrahamsen
Staff Writer

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has
implemented a new drug-testing policy this fall requiring all Divi-
sion I football players to participate. Originally brought before
NCAA legislation last January, the current policy states: 1) All
Division I football playing schools will be tested: 2) A medical
crew will be sent to each campus to conduct the testing; 3) All costs
will be covered by the NCAA; 4) A 48-hour notice will be given to
each school prior to testing; 5) 36 student-athletes, selected at ran-
dom, will be tested initially; 6) Tests will be administered for Possi-
ble steroids, diuretics, and “urine manipulators”; 7) Any school may
be tested more than once during the fall season.

This new policy marks the first time that colleges may be
tested during the regular season of a particular sport; testing has
been administered by NCAA officials at various post-season cham-
pionship events in prior years.

The passing of the issue has caused a controversy among col-
leges and universities across the nation. Bucknell belongs to a
minority of Division I schools which oppose the new legislation,
citing that the mandatory drug-testing infringes on Constitutional
rights. Rick Hartzell, Bucknell director of athletics, said that the
policy was “personally demeaning and an invasion of privacy.”
Hartzell also added that since Bucknell doesn’t offer full athletic
scholarships to students, the pressure to win at all costs here may
not be quite as big as other schools.

Most of the athletic departments in the Patriot and the Ivy
Leagues share similar views regarding the issue, but a large major-
ity of NCAA universities in “big-time” conferences (e.g. Big-10,
SEC, ACC, Big-8, Pac-10) favor the new policy. While public state
schools would appear more apt to have drug problems within the
athletic department than a school like Bucknell, the larger universi-
ties feel they need to support the drug-testing procedure so that, at
least on the surface, they have nothing to hide in their athletic
programs.

In today’s world of intercollegiate athletics, sports are more
of a business than just a game between individuals or teams. In the
1980's, scandals rocked universities from Coast to coast, where the
NCAA levied sanctions against schools in many different viola-
uns, primarily involving drug abuse and illegal recruiting. Okla-
homa, Florida, Southern Methodist, Oklahoma State, South Caro-
lina, Clemson: the list of sorry universities goes on and on

Even Notre Dame, a school thought of by many football fol-
lowers as the “cleanest” of any Top 25 national power, recently
received an extreme amount of unfavorable publicity when a former
Irish football player told Sports Illustrated in August that a consid-
erable number of Notre Dame players were consistently using ster-
oids, and that the Irish coaching staff encouraged players to take the
performance-enhancing drug in order to increase body strength and
bulk.

Stanford is a school that joins Bucknell in its Opposition of
the NCAA’s legislation. The NCAA News reported October 1 that
“NCAA-mandated drug tests for student-athletes at Stanford violate
the California constitutional right of privacy, the California Court
of Appeals said September 25 in upholding a lower-court decision.”
The Stanford ruling may set a precedent for other adamantly
opposed universities that wish to challenge the policy in court.

Now that it is mid-October and half of the football season is
over, Hartzell doubts that Bucknell will be tested this year. “The
NCAA has over 200 Division I and I-AA schools, and it would be
nearly impossible for the investigators to get around to every one in
the nation,” explained Hartzell.

A rumor floating around the sports offices is that Cornell is
the only school from either the Ivy or Patriot League in which the
NCAA has expressed an interest. But the Ithaca, New York, school
has yet to be tested, and there is absolutely no sentiment that Cor-
nell would be involved in any sort of drug problem

With the crackdown on steroids and other drugs around cam-
Puses the past few years, the NCAA does seem serious about ban-
ishing drugs from collegiate athletics. Hartzell believes the stricter
laws have been effective, to a degree. “I don’t think steroid use was
as rampant as it was a couple years ago,” notes Hartzell

As for the future, one of two Possible outcomes is bound to
happen; either athletes will continue to use body-building drugs to
gain more strength and speed, as they will discover more “masking
agents” to foil the testing system, or more young competitors will
realize that the short-term “benefits” of steroids aren’t worth the
negative long-term effects, and will discontinue using any sort of
drugs.

Hartzell witnesses, “I think most People have the right mis-
sion in mind then they work with college athletics. They want to
help people succeed, grow, and mature. I believe with all the scan-
dals people are realizing drug use is not something that’s helpful in
the long run.”

All-Blacks capture season’s first victory

By Mitch Benton and
Mark Spina

Bucknell’s men’s rugby club
traveled to Lancaster to take on
Franklin & Marshall Saturday, look-
ing for its first victory of the young
season. The All-Blacks squandered a
sixteen point first half lead two
weeks ago, and fell to East Strouds-
burg, 20-16. They met with more
disappointment the following week,
as a late penalty kick sailed wide of
the goalpost and the team was forced
to settle for a 66 tie with
Millersville

As Bucknell entered the game
the All-Blacks knew that the key to
success would be to eliminate the
sloppy play that had plauged them
throughout the earlier matches.
However the trend continued early,
as a number of miscues almost lead
to an F & M score

It was at this point that Buck
nell righted themselves with a num-
ber of long runs that brought the ball
into the Diplomat half
remained for most of the

period

These runs included a scramble
from outside center Mark Spina
*92, who took a pass from the
scrumhalf, Dave Keim ’91, at the
22-meter line and raced in for the
try.

The successful two-point
conversion kick by Howie Fetzer
*93 gave the All-Blacks a 6-0 lead.
Fetzer then closed the first half
scoring with a late penalty kick to
give the squad a 9-0 advantage.

Franklin & Marshall opened
the second half inspired, as their
pack drove over the try line for an
early score. The conversion failed,
leaving the All-Blacks lead at 9-4
At this point it appeared as though
Bucknell was ready for another
one of the second half letdowns
that had haunted them all season.

However the squad’s deter.
mination was echoed by team co-
captain Kaim’s statement after the
game, “We could have let their-
score get us down, instead we got
fired up and controlled the rest of
the game.” Keim led the ensuing
charge with a 15 meter run into the

found its way onto the foot of Jay
Normile who hit a skidder past
Wrigley into the lower left hand
comer of the net. The score came at

26:35 of the second half and gave
the Tigers a 1-0 lead. Bucknell did
not fold and caught some luck when
the game referee ejected two Tow-
son players with just under ten min-
utes remaining to give the Bison a

try zone and with Fetzer’s kick,
the score stood at 15-4. The final
Bucknell try came as the pack, led
by second row Chip Bousum ’91
and prop Chuck Gabler °92,
forced Franklin & Marshall into
their zone, where the duo col-
lapsed on the ball for the score.
The conversion was unsuccessful,
and the final score was 19-4.

When asked _— afterward
about the keys to the victory, co-
captain Bousum said, “Although I
don’t think we played our best
today, it was an encouraging
game. The team played well and
really came together after their
score. I was mostly impressed by
the play of the pack, who won the
ball often and got it out to the
backs.”

This pack play was led by
the strong techniques and tackling
of second row Steve Dowart '91
and prop Matt Minnick ’93. The
All-Blacks look to continue their
winning ways against a strong
squad from West Chester, behind

the Bison, and they lost a game in
which they had clearly outplayed
their opponent.

“The bottom line in this game
is taking advantage of your Oppo-

nt,” said Reynolds. “You have to
finish off a score when you have
the chance to score and we didn’t
that game. But the team shouldn’t
get down about this one. Keith
Goodling ['92], Brandon Poe, Evan

The toughest part of the sea-
son lies still down the road for the
Bison, and includes a crucial game
tomorrow at Lafayette.

“We played a sloppy game
against them last year, but I don’t
anticipate such this seaon.” said
Reynolds. “They’re a real solid ball
club and I’m amazed they beat
Fordham, who is the class of the
league this year.”

Bucknell (3-1 in the Patriot
League) can control their own des-
tiny and get into the league playoffs
with wins over Lafayette (2-1) and
Fordham (2-1) on October 20. With
six regular season games left, there
is a wide-open race for the Patriot
League title.

“We don’t even have a .500
record wrapped up yet,” indicated
Reynolds. “Our season is just get-
ting underway right now.”

Fearless NHL predictions

By Mark Griffith and
Eric Smith
Staff Writers

In the 1980's, the National Hockey League belonged to the
Islanders and Oilers, or so it seemed. Why did the other nineteen
teams even bother playing considering that only two other teams man-
aged to wrestle Lord Stanley’s Cup away from the dual dynasty? But
last Thursday, the 1990 NHL season opened and a flurry of new talent
could make the 1990’s the decade of perhaps...the Buffalo Sabres? Or
could it be that the “1940” chant that has rocked The Nassau Coli-
seum during Islander-Ranger brawls will soon be obsolete? Far-
fetched as it may seem, these are just two of the teams that see the
entrance to the Nineties as a ticket to hockey fame.

Below we give our predictions for teams we expect to see life
in hockey’s second season, listed in order of projected finish.

Patrick Division

Late-season acquisitions of Bernie Nichols and Mike Gartner
make the New York Rangers one of the biggest offensive threats in
the league. The Rangers also offer a very strong game in net with John
Vanbiesbrouck, Mike Richter, and newly acquired Mark LaForest.
Barring injuries to its top guns, this team should not be threatened by
the rest of the division. The New Jersey Devils have a healthy mix of
veterans and youth, helped by last year’s trade for Peter Stasny. The
Devils, though, will need a better performance from team captain Kirk
Muller, as well as from Soviet defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov to
make a run at first place. Another second place finish for New Je rsey
is in the cards for 1990-91. The Washington Capitals shocked many
fans last season with their play-off performance, eliminating both the
Rangers and the Devils. The style of play was characterized by impec-
cable defense. Unfortunately, Scott Stevens, a cornerstone of the
Washington defense is gone, and third place will be an accomplish-
ment. Pat LaFontaine is the only reason why the New York Islanders
will squeak into the fourth position in the Patrick Division (if you
don’t count the fact that Mario Lemieux will be out of a Pittsburgh
Pengu as uniform for at least two months).

Adams Division

If the Buffalo Sabres impressed you last year, now add former
Winnipeg standout Dale Hawerchuk to the likes of 40-goal scorers
Pierre Turgeon and Dave Andreychuk. The Buffalo defense is strong
and Darren Pupa is one of the league’s best in goal. It could be a ban-
ner year in Buffalo. The Boston Bruins come off a season with a
league high 101 points. This team has many weapons to work with,
such as 50-goal scorer Cam Neely. The Boston defense, led by Ray
Bourque, gave up the fewest goals in the league last year, and can be
expected to be equally tough this year. The addition of Denis Savard
to the Montreal Canadiens make the Habs another legitimate con-
tender for the Adams crown. But without Chris Chelios, the defense
cannot stand up to the Sabres and Bruins. As luck would have it, the
Hartford Whalers will easily back into the play-offs, considering the
Quebec Nordiques managed only 12 wins all of last season. Still,
Hartford is no push-over and players such as Ron Francis and Pat Ver-
beek will make this team interesting to watch.

Norris Division

Brett Hull has turned the St. Louis Blues into Stanley Cup
contenders. His 72-goal season last year will be tough to match, but
off-season acquisitions of Scott Stevens and Geoff Courtnall give the
Blues the depth they need to take top honors in the Norris. The Chi-
cago Blackhawks, minus Denis Savard, are still a team to reckon with.
In order for success to come Chicago’s way, Adam Creighton and
Greg Larmer need to pick up the slack of the departed Savard. With
Mario Lemieux out at the start of the season, and an aging Wayne
Gretzky easing his output, could the player of 1990 be the Detroit Red
Wings’ Steve Yzerman? The play of this man will lift Detroit out of
the Norris cellar into the play-offs once again. The play of the Toronto
Maple Leafs last season can be described as one-sided. The offense
attacked opposing defenses scoring 337 goals last season, third high-
est in the league. Unfortunately, Toronto gave up 358 goals, also third
highest. A rough style of play should make the Leafs play-off bound
again.

Smythe Division

In the most competitive division in hockey, the Edmonton Oil-
ers should once again reign supreme. Edmonton has five players who
scored 30+ goals last year. The defense is questionable, though, and
could open the door for other Smythe hopefuls in the chase for the
division crown. The Los Angeles Kings are running out of time to
convert the Gretzky Deal into a Stanley Cup, as was predicted. The
addition of Tomas Sandstrom, along with Luc Robitaille make the
Kings an offensive threat, but a lack of defense will haunt the Kings
again. Giving up 337 goals last season leaves much for improvement.
One of the league’s more surprising team’s this year could be the
Winnipeg Jets. The addition of Phil Howsley should make up for the
loss of Dale Hawerchuk, whose attitude had been sliding in recent
times. More offensive production will be needed, especially from
Tomas Steen (only 18 goals scored last year) to help the Jets over-
come the Oilers. What happened to the 1989 Stanley Cup Champions,
the Calgary Flames? Firing their head coach upon elimination from
last year’s tournament was not the answer, but possibly the start of
their problems. Though still a quality team, the Flames will be victi-
mized by a strong division and will have to settle for a fourth place

Golf concludes fall
on disappointing note

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

The golf team finished its
season this past week by participat-
ing in the ECAC Qualifier on
Thursday, October 4, as well as the
Norstar Bank Classic on Tuesday,
October 9.

The results for the two tour-
naments were fairly unimpressive,
as the average score for the team
on both days was an 89.

Coach Tommy Thompson
remained extremely optimistic
despite the setback, explaining that
he feels the play of the last half of
the season is not a fair representa-
tion of the team he expects to see
in the spring.

The ECAC Qualifier was
held on Thursday, despite heavy
periods of rain and wind. These
poor course conditions, coupled
with a lack of practice the week
before combined to crush the
team’s hopes of qualifying for the
ECAC Fall tournament.

Don Hansen ’94 led the team
with an 85, followed by captain
Mike Smigie ’91 and Scott Miller
93 with 87 and 89 respectively.
Doug Dollenberg °94 and Dave
Fries 93 rounded out the bottom
with a 91.

The team shot a combined
352, while the winning team shot
312, a fairly high score for a win-
ning team. While the players refuse
to blame the weather, they did
speculate that the lack of practice
was the major reason for their poor
play.

The team did not fare much
better in the Norstar tournament, as
they finished seventh in an eight-
team field. Once again the condi-
tions were poor, as it rained for
much of the day.

The course was an especially

difficult one, as it was used in 1989
for the U.S. Open where it pro-
duced fairly high scores.

Hansen led the team once
again with an 82, and Fries was the
only other player to record a score
below 90, as he shot an 86. Miller,
Smigie, and Howie Livingston ’93,
playing for Dollenberg, all shot in
the 90’s, recording scores of 90, 93,
and 99 respectively.

The team shot a combined
351, while the winner shot a 319.
The conditions clearly were a
major factor in the poor results,
however, as quality teams such as
Comell and Princeton each shot
341.

Coach Thompson chose to
ignore the events of the past week,
as he noted that they were clearly
not the same team as they were in
the beginning of the year. “I’m dis-
appointed,” he said, “but not dis-
couraged. We played some good
tournaments early on, especially
the Georgetown tournament.”

It was in the Georgetown
tournament that the team averaged
80 strokes per person to finish
tenth. Referring to the lack of prac-
tice time, Thompson remarked that,
for various reasons, there just
wasn’t enough time to play as
much as they wanted.

He feels, however, that there
is no reason to look negatively on
the season. “I prefer to remain an
optimist,” he stated. “I’m very
pleased with our two freshmen,
Hansen and Dollenberg. They are
as good as any two freshmen I’ve
seen in ten years.”

As for the spring season,
Thompson remarked, “We just
have to look for consistency. I
would like to see four good scores
each time out. If we can do that,
we'll be a viable team. I’ve seen
them do it before.”

Volleyball drops
sixth straight

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The women’s volleyball
team’s losing streak reached six last
weekend, as the Lady Bison lost
two more matches, dropping their
overall record to 2-11.

Bucknell squared off against
Big East power, Seton Hall, in the
first match, and dropped three
straight games to the Lady Pirates
by the scores of 15-3, 15-12, and
15-0. The Lady Bison’s hard luck
didn’t end their, as the lost three
straight to Columbia 15-3, 15-5, 15-
8.

Bucknell tried using its new
6-2 offense (6 hitters and 2 servers)
against Seton Hall, and it worked
for a while as Bucknell put together
a balanced offensive attack, scoring
12 points in the second game.

However, the Lady Pirates
were just too tough on defense in
the end, as they totally shut down
the 6-2 attack, allowing no points in
the entire third game. Co-captain
Kris Colbert 91 had one of the bet-
ter performances for the Lady
Bison recording 3 kills, 5 solo
blocks, and had a hitting percentage
of .200.

“T think the (6-2) offense is
working much better now,” said
setter Dee Scinta 92. “Mary (Jor-
dan °93) is becoming more comfort-
able with the position, and it just
adds more height to our front line,
because she is up there for three
rotations. It has raised our level of

play, so now we just have to go out
there and win one.”

Bucknell’s woes continued
against Ivy League rival Columbia
as well. The Lady Lions jumped all
over Bucknell in the first two
games of the match allowing the
Lady Bison only eight total points.
In the third game Bucknell jumped
out to a 6-0 lead, but Columbia
mounted a strong comeback, allow-
ing the Lady Bison only two more
points in the remainder of the
game,

Co-captains Kara Forosisky
"92 and Colbert each had six kills,
and substitute hitter Meg Kinney
*92, who has seen a lot of action
lately, had six kills of her own.

Bucknell will have a chance
to better its record this weekend as
it will host St. Francics and LaSalle
on Saturday. The team will take on
LaSalle at 10 a.m. and St. Francis
at 2 p.m. The Lady Bison have
already beaten St. Francis twice
this year.

“Right now we just have to
go out there and challenge our-
selves,” said Coach Cindy Opalski.
“We've been a little frustrated
lately because we know we should
be competitive. Our attitude has
been great and we just have to treat
the rest of the season as an entire
new season and forget about our
record.”

“We can all feel it,” said
Kinney, “we're right on the verge
of breaking out of this losing
streak.”

Both the Bucknell men’s and

Kutztown followed at a dis-

However, the lack of tough

the Bucknell women and their

Gulden remarked, “We were

is an excellent sign for the women,

more weeks. Their next meet is
October 27 at the Patriot League.

“There should be no adverse
effects that we don’t have another

question of whether or not his team
would be at a disadvantage by not
racing for so long. “We're getting

Football tramples Towson Sf. 55

Bison surge to best start since 1972 with fourth-straight victory

By Scott Brown
Staff Writer

The superlatives keep rolling
for the Bucknell football team this
year as the Bison reach the half-
way point of the season. The team
is off to its best start since 1972
and the wins are coming in dra-
matic fashion.

With the 55-26 win over
Towson State this past weekend
the Bison have become the first
team at Bucknell to have three suc-
cessive forty-point games since
1951 behind the offensive leader-
ship of quarterback Todd Hatajik
’91. Hatajik entered the game as
the nation’s second leading passer
in Division I-AA. Against Towson,
he passed for a career high 254
yards on 14-21 passes with two
touchdowns and one intetception,
his first in three weeks.

Bucknell dominated
facet of the Towson game as they
set a school record for first downs
with 33 while holding the ball for
almost 39 minutes of the game
They outrushed the Tigers 309
yards to 107, and outpassed them
259 yards to just 169. The rushing
total was the highest for the Bison
in ten years

Coach Lou Maranzana attrib-
uted this success to several factors.
“The offensive line is first. They
have been working hard together
for a while, now that most are sen-
iors. They take pride in what they
do. [Craig] Cavlovic *91 helps in
the back because he is physical and
determined. The tailbacks are
doing well. [Brian] Henesey ’92 is
having a great year and Matt
Walsh 93 is a really good player.
Kevin McElvene °93 is just wait-
ing for his chance.” The offense
showed their complete dominance

every

“a

in converting 9 of their eleven pos-
sessions for the game.

The tone of the game was set
early as Towson’s initial drive was
unsuccessful because of a dropped
pass that would have been a sure
touchdown. Bucknell took over
after Towson was unable to convert
a fourth down and eleven. Hatajik
started the drive with a 15-yard
completion to Cavlovic. After four
straight rushes by Henesey and an
incomplete pass, Hatajik connected
to Dan Scocca ’91 who made an
acrobatic grab for a 41-yard gain
down to the two yard line. On the
next play, Henesey rushed into the
endzone for the 7-0 early lead

On the next series, the special
teams got into the act when Eric
Jantzi °91 slipped though the line
and blocked a punt. He recovered
the loose ball and scampered 25
yards into the endzone to make the
score 14-0.

Bucknell’s defense stopped
the Tiger’s flat offense on the next
series and received the punt on
their own 21. Twelve plays later
the Bison were again in the end
zone as Walsh broke a tackle and
carried the ball the 12 yards for the
score. This touchdown brought the
score to 21-0 and the rout was on
The drive was highlighted by two
runs of 18 and 16 yards by Henesey
and a 14-yard pass from Hatajik to
Jeff Pape ’92.

The second quarter began
with a Towson punt. Bucknell took
the ball and began to drive follow-
ing a 22-yard pass from Hatajik to
Lester Erb °91, but on Hatajik’s
next pass, he threw an interception
as he was heavily rushed. The ball
was returned to the Bucknell 17.
Two plays later Chris Goetz con-
nected with Dewey Bares on a
pass that brought the ball down to

a ce

the one-yard line. It took the Tigers
three attempts but they finally put
the ball in on a carry by Jarrett
Grier.

Bucknell continued with the
pressure as soon as they got posses-
sion of the ball. In 9 plays covering
76 yards, the Bison scored on Hene-
sey’s second rushing touchdown of
the day, an 11 yard scamper up the
middle. It was his third touchdown
of the season. The drive consisted
of 3-3 passing by Hatajik for 40
yards

Four plays after that score, the
Bison retained possession as Trevor
Smith ’91 thwarted the Tiger drive
with his team-leading fourth inter-
ception of the season. Led by the
passing of Hatajik, the team drove
down the field using the clock
effectively. Hatajik completed a 14-
yarder to Erb and then a 27-yard
pass to Pape. Maranzana called
timeout with 38 seconds remaining
in the half, and the Bison punched
the ball in the remaining two yards
on a pass play from Hatajik to Pape.

The half ended with the Bison
in from 35-6. Bucknell had already
accumulated 303 total yards includ-
ing 184 yards in the air on 11 of 14
passing.

Henesey led all rushers with
71 yards on the ground. “We played
better than we’ ve played all year. It
was the best first half we have
played defensively,” stated Coach
Maranzana.

Bucknell began right where
they left off after receiving the ini-
tial kick. Cavlovic ran for 19 yards
on two carries and caught a pass for
another 14 yards. Hatajik then kept
the ball on a quarterback option,
and raced for ten yards. This was as
far as Bucknell could progress and
they were forced to kick. The result
was a 47-yard field goal for Todd

Tennis enjoys 3-0 week

By Kymm Carlson and
Christopher Mosunic
Staff Writer

The women’s tennis team
continued its winning streak last
week with relative ease, defeating
Colgate, Hofstra and Shippensburg
behind a winning attitude.

Last Saturday Bucknell
defeated one of its more formidable
opponents, Colgate, 6-3. After the
Red Raiders defeated the Lady
Bison on many previous occasions,
Bucknell was ready to retum the
favor. Karen Stagliano ’92, Steph-

anie Ryer ’92, and Kymm Carlson
*94 all breezed to victory in each of
their singles matches.

Elizabeth Murphy '94 made
her first singles appearance as the
Lady Bison’s sixth-seed, and was
triumphant in her debut. Murphy
commented, “I was really pumped
to play and there was no way I was
going to let down my teammates in
an important match like this one
against Colgate.”

In doubles play, Kim Thomp-
son ’93 and Carlson topped their
opponents 6-4, 6-1. Mary Ann
Benack ’92 and Stagliano were

;

deafeated, while Ryer and Jennifer
Wyckoff ’92 won in three hard-
fought sets.

The Lady Bison traveled to
Hofstra the following day and
crushed the Flying Dutchwomen
9-0.

Benack, who has played
many tough matches this year, once
again provided the most exciting
action of the day. Benack, the
Lady Bison’s #1 singles player,
struggled at the outset of the match
against Hofstra’s top seed, losing

When he wasn’t running through the Towson State defense, tailback Brian Henesey ’92 attempted to go
over the oppositon. Henesey led the Bison rushing attack with 115 yards on 19 carries.

Krutchkoff ’91. It was his longest
career field goal and his fifth
straight for the season.

Towson came back with a
touchdown of their own but again
failed the conversion resulting in a
38-12 score. Bucknell, though,
came right back as they drove 74
yards for the touchdown. The
touchdown was scored on a 42-
yard bomb from Hatajik to Erb.

“Lester’s catch was just a
play action pass where he got
inside the safety. They made a mis-
take. He ran a good pattern,” com-
mented Maranzana. For the day Erb
caught four passes for 92 yards. For
the season, he has 21 receptions for
359 yards, and a 17.1 yard average,
all three team-highs.

The highlight of the drive
was a personal foul committed by
Towson that gave the Bison a first
down instead of having to punt on
fourth and 20.

Bucknell scored again in the
third quarter on a 41-yard field goal
by Dan Levine ’93, his first ever at

the varsity level. This was set up by
a powerful 19-yard run by Hene-
sey. That rush put him over the 100
yard mark for the third time this
season. It gave him 115 yards for
the day. For the season he has
amassed 527 yards on 105 carries,
for over five yards a carry. He is
averaging over 105 yards a game, a
pace which, if continued, would
place him well over the 1,000 yard
mark for the season.

Bucknell got the ball back
again after another Towson State
touchdown and missed conversion.
They raced 52 yards down the field
culminating the 9 play drive with a
13-yard touchdown run by Jeff
Wall ’93, his second of the season.

This final carry was set up by
two runs of 14 and 19 yards by
McElvene. This put the score at 55-
18 before Towson scored again 54
seconds later. The Tigers converted
on the two-point attempt leaving
the score at 55-26. Bucknell then
ran Out the remaining 7:47 of the
game on their last possession.

Bucknell hosts the Princeton
Tigers tomorrow during Parents
Weekend. It will be the team’s
third contest against an Ivy League
opponent this year. The Bison won
easily in their previous two games
against both Columbia and Cornell.
Last year, the Bison were 2-2 ver-
sus the Ivy League.

Princeton is coming off a 27-
23 win over Brown last week.
Overall Princeton is 2-2, 1-1 in the
Ivy League. Commenting on the
Princeton game, Maranzana
explained, “They got beat their first
game of the season, like us, and
have gotten better. The other loss
was to Colgate at home and Col-
gate’s tough.

They lost Judd Garrett, prob-
ably the best player in the Ivy
League the last five years. The
team is developing a new personal-
ity without him. They have a good
quarterback and a good tailback.
They have big people that are prob-
ably the best athletes as a group
we've played.”

Water polo goes 2-1
in Fordham Tourney

By Scott Pollins
Staff Writer

Last weekend, Bucknell’s
water polo team traveled to Ford-
ham University for the first of two
league tournaments. The Bison had
a good solid weekend, turning in
fine performances against rival
Mid-Atlantic Conference squads.

Bucknell’s first game was
against perennial foe Slippery
Rock. Both teams played an
2xtremely even and tough game,
putting the game into overtime.
Slippery Rock eventually edged
Bucknell in an exciting double
overtime game, 13-11.

Danny Brown ’93 and Walter
Kelly 92 led Bucknell with 4 and 3
goals respectively. John Bradbury
*92 played an outstanding game in
goal, registering 21 saves. Coach
Lynn Kachmarick stressed that “the
guys played very tough.”

The Bison next faced a strong

Princeton squad. The Tigers were
coming off a big upset victory over
Iona on Friday night, so Bucknell
was anticipating a great game. As
expected, both teams played ue-
mendous defense.

The score was deadlocked at
6-6 after regulation, forcing the
game into overtime. After two
intense overtime periods, the score
was still tied at 6-6. It took two sud-
den death periods before captain
John Zeigler °91 put away the win-
ning goal. Again Brown and Kelly
led the Bison with 4 and 3 goals
respectively.

Veterans Zeigler and Mead
Briggs ’91 played strong defense,
while goalie Bradbury had another
great game in the goal.

Bucknell’s final game was
against Queens University. The first
half was close, ending with the
Bison leading a tight contest 8-6.

The Bison exploded in the
second half, and pulled away win-

ning 17-9. Leading the surge was
Kelly, who netted 4 goals in third
quarter alone, en route to a 5 goal
performance. Zeigler and Kevin
Schroth *92 contributed 4 goals
each. Brown also registered 3
scores.

Coach Kachmarick main-
tained that her squad had “a good
solid weekend.”

This weekend, the Bison will
be without their coach. Kachmarick
will be traveling to Budapest, Hun-
gary to play with the Women’s
National Water Polo Squad. Assist-
ant coach Jim Harvey ’89 will take
over the squad when the team trav-
els to MIT in Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts for an Eastern Water Polo
Association tournament.

Seeded #1, Bucknell looks to
demonstrate their polo strength
against such teams as Princeton,
Boston College, and MIT,

The Bison will play #8 seed
Villanova at 8 a.m. on Saturday.

Colgate adopts similar
social-residential plan

By Lisa Hirschkorn
Staff Writer

The president of Colgate’s
Inter-fraternity Council, Jamie
Lane, knows about the effort to
eliminate the Greek system—first
hand. “It is indicative of what’s
happening across the country,” said
Lane. On September 22, the Col-
gate trustee’s recommendations to
their Residential Life were
approved.

Similar to Bucknell, residen-
tial life at Colgate is in the process
of evolution. The similarities
between the universities focus on
the central role of Greek life. Col-
gate is a small liberal arts college
which maintains a predominantly
Greek history. With nine fraterni-
ties and five sororities, approxi-
mately 55% of men and 45% of
women are Greek. Last spring,
however, Colgate’s faculty brought
the status quo into question. The
faculty recommended that the
Greek system be abolished by the
fall of 1994,

The course of Colgate’s

reforms recalls the diagrams that
President Sojka presented in the
Weis Center last spring. In Buck-
nell’s case, the Greek review pro-
ceeded from the Greek Review
Committee (1988-1989) to the
faculty motion (1989), After the
GRC’s findings, the Faculty vetoed
the Greek system, and Sojka made
his recommendations to the trus-
tees (May 1). With the Trustee
Implementation Program (TIP) the
recommendations will be effective
for the 1991-1992 academic year.

“The vast majority of com-
mittees in TIP are made up of stu
dents,” according to Gerry Com-
merford, dean of Residential Life.
Commerford explained “our model
was influenced by twenty-eight
institutions that we corresponded
with last January.” Residential Life
based their modifications on meet-
ings and conversations with admin-
istrations and students at other uni-
versities. “We’re influenced by
other institutions, so it lends us to
believe that other universities are
influenced by us,” Commerford
added.

Average Scared

At Colgate, the Greek
Review Committee was called the
Special Committee of Residential
Life and was composed of eight
trustees. Following the faculty
motion (Spring 1989), the Special
Committee studied the residential
life system for over a year. Accord-
ing to IFC President Jamie Lane
‘91, Colgate has an implementation
committee which represents the
whole university: students, alumni,
parents, faculty, and administration.
“There is potential for things to be
worse but there is mixed reaction
about specific policies.” Lane said,
“...the ‘no pledging’ policy and the
new bid rules are in conflict with
national policies.”

“After talking with national
presidents this week, I don’t know
how things are going to exist with
the University guidelines,” Lane
said. Because the University’s
guidelines are in conflict with the
national rules, Colgate’s fraternities
will have two choices. Lane
explained that either fraternities can

Morale problems persist

Administration seeking solutions

By Tommy Abel
Staff Writer

The issue of low student
morale has again come to the fore-
front as students passed out a leaf-
let condemning the university at the
football game against Princeton on
Saturday, October 13.

The leaflet focused on the
perception that “Bucknell Univer-
Silty is using a double standard to
manipulate the students into giving
up their basic rights as American
citizens.” This perception stems
from the fact that the university is
exempt from abiding by Constitu-
tional restrictions in its enforce-
ment of the laws of the state of
Pennsylvania, namely Act 31, since
it IS a private institution.

The leaflet asks, “Why is the
University following the law of the
State in the case of Act 31? How
can it claim that it can ignore cer-
tain laws in order to enforce others?
This is a blatantly abusive system
where those in charge of enforcing
the law don’t have to answer to it.”

Additionally the authors of
the leaflet chastised the university’s

“diminishing respect for auton-
omy.” The leaflet asked people to
“Consider the scope of the adminis-
tration’s authority over our lives...
It tells us: 1) when gathering we
must inform them (registered
party); 2) to limit how many of us
gather (invite lists); 3) to limit
when and how often we gather
(limiting the number of social func-
tions); 4) we must segregate our-
selves by age or class (twenty-one-
year-old sections, restriction of
interaction with freshmen). We
allowed ourselves to be subject to:
5) routine and uncalled-for security
raids (thanks, but if there is trouble
we will call); 6) random room
searches without reasonable suspi-
cion (whether a door is open or
closed).”

The leaflet symbolized “frus-
tration don’t know
what to do because usual student
channels totally
ignored,” according to an author of
the leaflet. The leaflet summarized
this sentiment when it explained,
“The nature of this document is
reacuionary and not radical.”

One of the authors of the leaf

because we

have been

Ict explained that “our ultimate
goal is to exert as much pressure
on the administration and trustees
because it seems that they mold
our lives at Bucknell virtually
unchecked by what we think. We
want to prevent that, we need to
prevent that from happening if we
are to truly develop as individuals,
rather than having the administra-
tion ‘develop’ us.”

Student sentiment confirms
that the issues raised in the petition
are indeed troubling to the student
body. Senior Rob Hess has noticed
the languishing state of morale
across the board. “Moral on cam-
Pus is probably the lowest it’s ever
been. I’m a third brother that has
come to Bucknell, so I’ve encoun-
tered the B.U. experience since
1983 through my brothers being
here and it hasn’t been until
recently, my sophomore year, that
I’ve seen a slow decrease in the
basic social atmosphere at
Bucknell.”

Students frequently complain
about the lack of social opportuni-
ties at Bucknell and the lack of
“respect for our rights,” according

See MORALE, page 2

Sojka assesses Bucknell

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

“These are not easy times.
My opening statement in the uni-
versity’s annual report is a little
gloomy. I’m announcing, as I think
most of the trustees already know,
that this is an.extraordinarily diffi-
cult period in American higher edu-
cation.” The position of America’s
universities is becoming exceed-
ingly problematic, according to
President Sojka. One such problem
facing Bucknell is that of decreased
morale.

Sojka acknowledges as recent
student sentiment clearly shows
that “there is a major morale prob-
lem.” In trying to pinpoint the
cause of this problem Sojka cited
several “contributing factors,”
among them: the fact that the Bison
has not been completed, therefore
limiting social possibilities; the
abundance of fraternities that were
on probation earlier in the semester
which “deprived the campus of a
place to go and things to do”; and
finally, student unrest as to the
enforcement policies of security.
Sojka crystallized the problem
when he explained that “people just
sense there’s an awful lot of change
going on.”

Sojka sees the changes that
are taking place at Bucknell as part
of a national movement in which “
{the pendulum] would swing back a
little bit.” He stressed that this is, in
fact, a problem that is not limited to
Bucknell. “Exactly what’s been
going on here has been going on at
Lafayette.” According to Sojka, the
reason for the unrest everywhere is
that “we’re in a national and partic-
ularly a Pennsylvania period when
life in college is not going to be
what it was, and nobody who’s
going through it is going to like it.”

Among those who do not like
it is Sojka himself. The idealism
that Sojka brought into the presi-
dency has been twisted due to
external circumstances. “I came to
a school that I thought was a lot
like the place where I was an
undergraduate, and I really like
undergraduates. I wanted to be the

stuff. I really work at that, and the

This role seems especially

troubling for Sojka because he gen-
uinely enjoys interacting with stu-
dents. After several meetings with
student groups to discuss the
morale problem Sojka said, “I wish

Administration receives mid-term grades

Survey Analysis
By Brian Davison
Staff Writer

With all of the professed
unrest among the students, The
Bucknellian decided to ask students
their opinions on top administrators
and on Bucknell in general, right
now, and what they thought of
Bucknell a year ago.

Two weeks ago The Bucknel-
lian sent a direct mail survey to a
total of 288 students in the sopho-
more, junior, and senior classes.
Slightly over 11% were returned.

The survey results, while not
surprising, show some of the
administration as doing an above
average job, and others not doing
as well. In addition, some adminis-
trators, namely, Vice-president
Shinn, Vice-president Greaves, and
Vice-president Maxwell had a large
percentage of students who did not
have an opinion, showing, as one
student remarked, “This reflects my
awareness of their jobs and

and independents. “The social life/
scene at Bucknell has definitely
gone downhill and due to that stu
dent attitude and morale has also
gone down. Bucknell has recently
tumed into a soft of ‘suit

ing that she feels “that security this
year has taken away our freedom. I
feel that I am always doing some-

my privacy is not important. If they

the notion of a “suitcase school”
saying that “college students need a
release from studies, especially at
such a demanding institution. Thus,
if it is a hassle to relax and/or have
any sort of fun, they will go else-
where. This is clearly occuring at
this campus, as all one needs to do
is look at the empty spaces in park-
ing lots on the weekends of resi-
dence halls and fraternities.”

One student predicts, “In a
couple of years, the way things are
going, this campus will be non-
Greek, dry, and even more boring
than it is now.” Comments a senior,
“The point is that, due to the
administration’s negative attitude
toward [the students], a bitter atti-
tude is forming. If the university
does not rid itself of the bureau-
cratic bison droppings, it is going
to see a change in its student popu-
lation. I for one do not want to see
that change. Until Bucknell allows
us to be casual and gives us credit
for being free-thinking, young
adults, the administration is only
going to promote bitterness and
frustration. They will certainly not
achieve a state in which the princi-
ples they seek are achieved.”

The genesis of a policy

Legal basis of the alchol policy explained ...

By David Murray
Staff Writer

Many students are asking
questions these days about our
alcohol policy, and how it’s
enforced. They wonder who

created the policy,

News what it has to do with

Analysis Pennsylvania Act 31,

= and when it will

change again. Students also won-
der why it seems so “harsh.”

It tums out that the policy is
a creation primarily of General
Counsel and Secretary of the Uni-
versity Elias Abelson, with some
input from John Dunlop, dean of
students, and Timothy Murrell, for-
mer director of security and safety.

It also turns out that our pol-
icy is a direct result of Act 31, and
that its intention is to provide a
recourse for the University in the
event of a catastrophic cident
involving a Bucknell student. To
understand the policy, however,
Abelson believes we must first
understand what led up to the
enactment of Act 31.

HISTORY

According to Abelson, there
were two significant precursors to
Act 31. “First was the growing
national realization in the early
1980s that (1) the majority of acci-
dents on the road are alcohol
related, and (2) that the largest
responsible group is late-teen driv-
ers.” That realization led the fed-
eral government to encourage all
States to raise the legal drinking
age to 21.

Second was the Pennsylvania
host liability rule. It said that the
host of a gathering at which alco-
hol is present is virtually com-
pletely responsible for the actions
of guests under 21, and not at all
responsible for the actions of
guests over the age of 21.

Abelson used an example
involving two people, one the day
before his 21st birthday, the other
the day after his 21st birthday,
drinking at Abelson’s house. If
they both got in their cars and
killed someone, Abelson said, he
would be responsible for the sub-
21-year-old, but not at all responsi-
ble for the over-21-year-old. “Now
this is a stupid rule,” Abelson said,
“but it’s a Pennsylvania rule, not
my rule.”

Additionally, Abelson said,
two 1987-1988 events spurred the

Pennsylvania legislature to action
on Act 31. First were the Princeton
“eating club’ incidents where two
under-age students fell into comas
after having been forced to drink
alcohol by their peers. Second was
the direct personal involvement of
several Pennsylvania _ legislators
and their families in cases involv-
ing drunk drivers

ACT 31

In general, Abelson believes,
laws that arise as a response to
problems “tend to be less than sub-
ue.” It was this aumosphere, accord-
ing to Abelson, that bred Act 31
Act 31 itself, according to Abelson,
very simply states “that it is a crim-
inal offence for a person [or institu-
tion] to furnish alcohol to a minor.”
The problems of interpretation
begin, however, with the word ‘fur-
nish.’ The Pennsylvania legislature
further defined ‘furnish’ as “allow-
ing a minor to possess alcohol on
property or premises owned or con-
trolled by the person [or institution}
charged.”

Again, however, a question
of semantics arises. What does
“allowing” mean? How far can the
definition carry? To answer that
question, Abelson believes we must
look to the courts, which have
defined ‘allow’ in this instance as
“to create an hospitable environ-
ment for the possession of alcohol.”

It should therefore be the
University’s mission, in Abelson’s
mind, “to make a reasonable effort
to make certain that we have not
created an hospitable environment”
for the possession of alcohol by
under-age students.

IMPLEMENTATION AT
BUCKNELL

Act 31 became effective on
May 1, 1988, and according to
Dunlop, “in the fall semester of ‘88
we began to realize the implica-
tions of that act for us.” President
Gary Sojka then formed the Act 31
task force, consisting of Dunlop
and Murrell, and chaired by Abel-
son, to, in Dunlop’s words, “decide
what now was encumbent on the
University” as a result of the new
law.

“Mr. Abelson agreed to
rough out for us what he thought
we had to do as a consequence of
the court cases and the law,” said
Dunlop. After extended debate
between Dunlop, Abelson, and to a

lesser extent Murrell, the task force
issued its first report, which was
simply a refinement of Abelson’s
original ‘roughed-out’ suggestions

That report was released for
public comment in December of
1988, and the deadline for com-
ments and suggestions was set as
February 15, 1989. Dunlop conjec-
tures that the number of comments
received was low primarily because
much of the University community
was unavailable during the sugges-
tion period.

After considering the com-
ments that were received, the Act
31 task force issued its second and
final report to the President’s coun-
cil. According to Dunlop, “that
report contained very few changes
from what [Abelson] had originally
suggested.”

The President’s council
released the policy on May 19,
1989 in a memorandum entitled
“Bucknell University Policy State-
ment on Alcohol.” The specific
details of the policy were developed
later by Dunlop and the office of
student life, but he insists “every
thing flows from the work of the
Act 31 task force which Mr. Abel-
son chaired.”

CONCLUSION

In the final analysis, Dunlop
succinctly summarizes the current
situation. “That’s clearly what
we’re doing,” he says, “we are elab-
orately trying to cover our institu-
onal rear end.” Dunlop continues,
“{Abelson’s] approach for doing
that is to reduce risk, almost elimi
nate risk if you possibly can. You’ ll
see that our policies are designed to
do that.”

At the same time, Abelson
makes clear that the “feelings of
anger and frustration” students have
“must be directed to the legislature
that formulated the law and not to
the administration” of the Univer-
sity. He compares it with the cur-
rent budget debate over a gas tax. If
a nine cent-per-gallon tax is
imposed, he says, motorists would
be foolish to complain to a gas sta-
tion owner; they must voice their
concems to the Congress which
enacted the law.

On the whole, Abelson’s
actions seem no more than prudent
steps to keep the University, again
in Dunlop’s words, “out of court
and out of jail. He’s the expert, and
I’m hard pressed to disagree with
him.”

Officials discuss
Ethiopian peace

Two senior Bush administra-
tion officials have met secretly with
the Marxist government of Ethiopia
and Eritrean rebels in order to
revive peace talks that broke off
nearly one year ago, according to a
State Department official.

American officials are not
optimistic that a settlement can be
reached anytime soon. These meet-
ings may, however, establish a
framework for talks between the
government and the rebels while
also involving the United States
and the Soviet Union.

The Ethiopian government
faces famine and reductions in
Soviet aid, while the Eritreans fear
that Iraq, which American officials
believe has supplied the rebels with
weapons in the past, is preoccupied
with the international blockade.

Senate to hold
ethics hearings

The Senate Ethics Committee
voted Tuesday to hold public hear-
ings next month concerning allega-
tions that five senators improperly
intervened with federal officials on
behalf of Charles Keating, owner of
a failing savings and loan.

The investigations will look
into whether Senators John McCain
of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio,
Dennis DeConcini of Arizona,
Alan Cranston of California, and
Donald Riegle of Michigan, over-
stepped Senate rules by meeting
with federal regulators and taking
other steps to help Mr. Keating and
his associates. The five senators
received $1.3 million from Keating
and his asscoiates as contributions
to their campaigns and other
causes.

The Senate has never before
conducted disciplinary hearings
into the conduct of so many sena-
tors. The five senators will be
asked to testify.

Congress OKs
more spending

Despite the plans to reduce
the federal budget deficit, House
and Senate negotiators agreed on
$22.6 billion more in social welfare
spending for a wide range of pro-
grams in this fiscal year than in the
year that ended September 30.

The agreement devised by
members of the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees would
provide $182 billion for the Depart-
ments of Labor, Education, and
Health and Human Services for this
fiscal year, a 14 percent increase in
spending over the same period last
year.

The full House quickly
approved the bill on Tuesday. Sen-
ate approval is expected, as is Pres-
ident Bush’s signature.

Dole resigns as
labor secretary

Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole announced Wednesday that
she will resign her post to take a
position as president of the Ameri-
can Red Cross.

Dole confided that the job
was frustrating because it did not
allow enough political recognition
and because of the limited scope
available for program initiatives,

She has complained in the
past that John Sununu, White
House chief of staff, has led negoti-
ations with Congress over a mini-
mum wage increase, a traditional
area of the Labor Department.

Phi Kappa Psi house negotiations stall

By Travis Elliott
Staff Writer

Phi Kappa Psi’s Pennsylva-

‘nia Gamma House Corporation, the

local alumni chapter association,
and Bucknell University are final-
izing an agreement which would
sell the Phi Psi house and its sur-
rounding property to the Univer-
sity, according to Paul Pigman, the
President of Penn Gamma.

Pigman said, “There is a final
agreement which we are ready to
sign; We do not have any further
requirements of the University nor
do they have any further require-
ments of us.”

A major obstacle to the re-
colonization of Phi Kappa Psi at
Bucknell was overcome in August
of this year when the courts dis-
missed a petition for the dissolu-
tion of the Penn Gamma House
Corporation that had been negotiat-
ing to sell the Phi Psi house to the
University. The suit was filed last
year by a member of the local
alumni association with the support
of Phi Psi’s Executive Council
because they opposed the terms of
the sale which were being nego-
tiated between Penn Gamma and
members of Bucknell’s
administration.

Pigman gave a number of
justifications for the sale of the
property to the University. Accord-
ing to Pigman, “We [the Board of
Directors of Penn Gamma] feel that
the atmosphere of student attitudes

and the Chapter’s inability to over-
see the house make the sale of the
house to the University the best
option.” He explained that the Uni-
versity would be better able to
oversee the Phi Psi chapter than
members of the board of directors
because the board members are not
in close daily contact with the
fraternity.

Pigman noted that the Uni-
versity has taken a hands off atti-
tude in the past, but now it has
decided to take an interest in gov-
eming student behavior. Pigman
said, “Bucknell will be able to man-
age the facility in a more prudent
manner. It was the behavior of stu-
dents that caused the whole prob-
lem in the first place.”

According to the statements
of the Executive Council, the pro-
posal would sell the Phi Psi house
and its surrounding property to the
University for a fraction of its real
value and did not adequately guar-
antee that Phi Psi members would
have continued rights to live in the
house.

Pigman said that under the
Current proposal the Phi Psi broth-
ers will have the right to live in the
house, and that right can only be
revoked with the approval of the
board of trustees. Thus, any
changes that the faculty would like
to make in the agreement must first
be approved by the board of trus-
tees. Pigman also noted the if the
University decides to sell the house
in the future, it must offer it to Phi

Psi first.

According to the Executive
Council of Phi Psi, it supported the
lawsuit because “under Pennsylva-
nia law, a corporation charged with
failing to pursue its objectives must
show cause to avoid being dis-
solved. The Executive Council rea-
sons that in attempting to give the
house away with no hard guarantee
of future use, the House Corpora-
tion would relinquish its charge of
holding property for the Chapter
and of promoting the Chapter’s
best interests.”

The judge in the case refused
to dissolve the Penn Gamma House
Corporation.

According to an article in the
Fall 1990 issue of The Shield of
Phi Psi, the court stipulated that the
sale of the house would have to be
voted on and approved by the
majority of Phi Psi’s local alumni
association.

Paul Pigman responded, “It is
absolutely not the case that a for-
mal vote has to be taken by the
members to approve the sale.” He
explained that the court’s decision
simply required that the members
be notified of the actions being
taken by the House Corporation in
accordance with Section 59-23 of
the Pennsylvania Statutory Code.
Pigman said that mail had been sent
out informing members of the
actions of the board of directors
and calls had been made to inform
members of meetings.

DeCerchio speaks with IFC

By Tommy Abel
Staff Writer

As the tensions between Uni-
versity Security and the student
body continue to increase, Frater-
nity presidents and IFC Representa-
lives were given the opportunity to
meet with the new Head of Secur-
ity, Vincent DeCercio. DeCercio
took full advantage of his time with
the Greek representatives by intro-
ducing himself and outlining his
detailed program which targets the
increasing problems between Uni-
versity Security and the campus
community. DeCercio also fielded
questions by the Representatives
and commented extensively on
present situations at Bucknell.

DeCercio comes to the Buck-
nell campus from Drexel Univer-
sity where he held the position of
head of security for three years.
Before Drexel, DeCercio headed
the Security Department at Bryn
Mawr College for 7 years. DeCer-
cio quickly defined the responsibil-
ity that his department had to the
University and to the Student body,
“to make the University a safe
place for students to pursue their
academic interests.” He went on
further to state that he is a strong
advocate of student rights and par-
ticipation, and that he would adopt
an “open-door” policy in managing
the Security Department. DeCercio
exhibited his sincerity to the Greek
body by stating that he will run a
Department which emphasizes

Openness, communication, and
understanding, characteristics
which did not seem present before.
DeCercio continued to develop his
rapport with the Greeks by admit-
ting that he felt there was a break-
down in the System, or at least in
the way it was enforced before his
arrival.

Mike Dominguez, president
of the IFC, voiced some of his con-
cerns and hopes for DeCercio and
his department. Dominguez stated
clearly that he was not asking
Security not to enforce University
policy, but instead to find a more
professional and more equitable
method of enforcement. Domin-
guez’s suggestions, which ranged
from swift and accurate reporting
of all incidents to a modified
method of patrolling, were all well
accepted by DeCercio.

DeCercio was given the
Opportunity to present his plan for
dealing with the recent problems
between University Security and
the fraternities. First, he wishes to
meet with all of the concerned par-
ties (Greeks, Security, Student Life,
Staff). From there he can move to
his second step, to evaluate the
information and create an ad hoc
Security Advisory Committee. This
committee would be made up of
Greeks, student representatives,
Security, Student Life, newspaper
staff, and other administrators. He
stressed the fact that this body
would not be a figure-head type

group, but instead would have the
opportunity to actively contribute to
Security policy. Third, the Depart-
ment will define the University pol-
icy and their interpretation of Penn-
sylvania law in writing. They will
also list a proper security procedure
and common abuses in writing. The
Department will also revise and
create the procedures and sanctions
which are needed to address the var-
ious violations and abuses. All of
these lists and definitions must get
the approval of the Security Advi-
sory Committee before they are
implemented. Finally, he will work
with the committee to implement
these procedures. Also the Security
Advisory Committee will become a
permanent body used both to hear
complaints and as a sounding board
for new ideas.

DeCercio then addressed the
concems of the Greeks in atten-
dance. He guaranteed that there
would be swift accurate reporting of
all incidents and that these reports
“will not release any student
names.” This would allow both the
offenders and the IFC Judiciary
Committee to better prepare them-
selves prior to meeting. DeCercio
also promised to develop a clear
definition of “reasonable cause”
which would be approved by stu-
dent groups including the IFC. He
ageed with representatives that:
equal treatment of all organizations
is a necessity, a committee in liai-
son with Security must be devel-

that students at Bucknell have
expressed an interest in recoloniz-
ing the Penn Gamma Chapter.

Chris Mitchell "92 heads a
group of Bucknellians who are cur-
rently trying to re-establish Phi Psi
on campus. According to Mitchell,
an interest group has already been
formed, and it should be officially
recognized on campus this spring.

Mitchell said, “The National
is going to try to raise enough
money to restore the house so
hopefully it will be nationally
owned, but if not, the University
will purchase it and fix it up by
next fall.”

According to Mitchell, the
administration has been receptive
to the group’s wish to restart Phi
Psi at Bucknell. Mitchell said,
“There have been a number of
roadblocks to recolonizing Phi Psi,
but the University has been the
most cooperative of everyone. The
administration has been very help-
ful and enthusiastic.”

According to Phi Psi’s
national, the property has appre-
ciated from its original cost of
$65,000 to nearly $1 million.

It is estimated that restoring
the house to a condition which
would be comparable to that of
University residence halls would
cost $335,000, and an $18,000
mortgage is still outstanding on the
property.

Using the restoration figure,
the trustees authorized the adminis-
tration in May 1988 to negotiate a
purchase price for the property
which would not exceed $350,000.

According to estimates of Phi
Kappa Psi’s Executive Council, the
proposed agreement would transfer
the title of the house, the land, and
an adjacent lot to Bucknell for only
four percent of its actual replace-
ment value.

In the article in The Shield of
Phi Psi, the Phi Psi National
expressed its disappointment with
that offer and the House Corpora-
tion’s proposal which would, in
essence, “give it [the property] to
the University.”

Pigman countered that Buck-
nell will agree to pay the entire
expense of fixing up the house. He
claimed that it would be pointless
for the Corporation to bear the
expense of renovating the house,
only to have it poorly managed.

Phi Psi Fraternity Headquar-
ters surveyed all Penn Gamma
alumni and asked them if they sup-
ported the sale of the house to
Bucknell. Of the nearly 25 percent
of alumni who responded, 97 per-
cent preferred to have a Phi Psi
corporation managing the Chapter
house, and three percent supported
the sale of the property to
Bucknell.

One alumnus replied, “I am

leaders

oped, and that Security needs to
maintain the level of respect and
trust that it receives from students.
Several “grey areas” did come into
discussion, such as the implementa-
tion of individual sanctions instead
of group sanctions, when only a
few members of an organization are
in violation of University policy.
Amother “grey areas” that came into
question were the concepts of pri-
vate property and probable cause.
DeCercio promised that his Depart-
ment would quickly develop an
acceptable answer to those ques-
tions. Finally, DeCercio assured the
representatives that University
Security would adhere to the mis-
sion statement of the University,
exemplifying compassion and civil-
ity, and that the Security Advisory
Committee would help create a sys-
tem of accountability for those
involved in enforcing University
policy.

Vincent DeCercio informed
the Greek representatives present
that he was committed in, “remov-
ing you [the Greeks] as part of the
problem and making you part of the
solution.” DeCercio made a strong
impact on those present. His “‘open-
door” policies and his participatory
style of management were well
received by all. DeCercio wants to
be a more actively involved Direc-
tor of Security. “My style is to
bring students into the governance
process and students have risen to
the challenge very well.

The university estimates that it would take $335,000 to repair both the
inside and outside of the Phi Kappa Psi house.

very disappointed in the poor com-
munication from the House Corpo-
ration and/or that of the Penn
Gamma Chapter. I am very willing
to help however I may to save the
house from University ownership/
control.”

Phi Psi chapters have lost
houses at Stanford University,
Dickinson College, and Franklin
and Marshall College in the past
because their property transfer
agreements did not contain explicit
renewal options. Phi Psi National
fears a similar fate at Bucknell.

The Executive Council of Phi
Kappa Psi said, “Bucknell would
be permitted at any time to declare
that the house is no longer used as a
residence hall and could thereby
evict all members on four months’
notice and never again make the
house available to the Chapter.”
The Council also noted that the pro-
posal does not include a guaranteed
option to renew Phi Psi’s right to
occupy the house after the initial
ten-year term.

Bucknell currently owns and
operates Kappa Sigma, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Alpha
Mu as residence halls. Elias Abel-
son, general counsel of the Univer-
sity, noted that the guarantee of
occupancy does not exist with these
University owned fraternity houses.

Although the Executive
Council admitted that these three
fraternities have reported no prob-
lems with their agreements with
Bucknell, it expressed worries that
the University attitudes toward fra-
ternities might change in the future,
citing Bucknell’s new social resi-
dential plan as a recent change in
the University’s attitude toward
Greek organizations.

Pigman contended, “If the
University as a whole wants to get
rid of the Greek System, then fos-
tering a fraternity is pointless. It
takes a partnership between the fra-
ternity and the University to create
a meaningful organization.”

The Shield of Phi Psi article
also stated, “The Executive Council

is not inherently opposed to selling
the house to Bucknell; its main con-
cern is that the property is not trans-
ferred for a fraction of its value
with no solid assurances of contin-
ued Phi Psi occupancy.”

Elias Abelson, general coun-
sel for the University, confirmed
that Bucknell is still negotiating
with Phi Psi in regards to the future
of the house.

The administration suspended
Phi Kappa Psi’s charter in Spring of
1988 and then set August 31, 1990
as the first possible date for reor-
ganization. When the dispute
between the Phi Psi National and
it's local alumni association
erupted, the University withdrew
from negotiations and proclaimed
its neutrality on the issue.

In a letter to Phi Psi Head-
quarters, the University stated the
chapter would not be allowed to
reorganize until the 1991-92 aca-
demic year because of the dispute
within the fraternity and also
because of the upcoming changes
and uncertainties in Bucknell’s
social-residential structure.

explained that either fraternities
can go unrecognized by nationals
or stay with nationals and go unrec-
ognized by the University. Yet,
under the new residential policy,
fraternity houses would be sub-
jected to the same stipulations as
other off-campus housing units. “If
it came down to it, the fraternities
would have to be recognized by the
University,” Lane concluded.

The changing residential sys-
tems indicate that national fraterni-
ties and sororities need revisions of
their own. Commerford suggested
th here be “a different kind of
membership development in
nationals...the
always had are not consistent with

practices they’ve
where we are in 1990.”
Bucknell’s student
agreed that the creation of TIP as
well as Colgate’s similar model

leaders

will improve students’ image of the
University. Dave Skena ‘92, presi
dent of Bucknell Student Govern-
ment, said “students will realize
that the problem of

dential changes is not specific
, “the trus-

social/

. 1 <a j
to Bucknell ena said

tees have let TIP pound out the
details...1 hope for Colgate’s sake
they let the directives be carried out
by students.” Mike Dominguez ‘91,
IFC President, viewed TIP as “a
broad cross-section of the Univer-
sity in deciding how recommenda-
tions are going to be implemented.”
Yet, according to Dominguez,
“Colgate might have taken a wiser
step into implementation period.
Bucknell is allowing one year
which doesn’t leave much time for
planning.”

Charlotte Jacobsen-Weddle,
Associate VP for Student Life,
believed that the _ similarities
between Colgate and Bucknell
“can’t be accidental” because Col-
gate’s Dean of Students was
directly informed of the changes at
Bucknell, Weddle explained “Col-
gate looked at what we had dome
and what Dickinson had
done...we’re moving in parallel, but
clearly different directions.” Wed-
dle believes the changes “clearly
suggest that the president’s and the
trustees’ vision is one that Colgate
has found a positive or convincing
model.”

Greek philanthropy contributes
to off campus community

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

Fraternities and sororities
hold an important position, not only
on campus, but within the Lewis-
burg community. Most Greek
organizations form philanthropy
committees to decide which service
projects the group will donate
money to. These philanthropies
range from donating food and
clothing to sponsoring a room at
the Ronald McDonald House.

Fraternities often become
involved in at least one philan-
thropic project. Chi Phi visits the
United Methodist Church once a
year for a round of bingo. Around
St. Patrick’s Day, fraternity broth-
ers sell green carnations in the Lan-
gone Center; proceeds go to benefit
Muscular Distrophy.

Hosting the Special Olympics
is Chi Phi’s most time-consuming
task. The house has hosted the
games since 1984. “This year, the
brothers of Chi Phi look forward to
our first nationally sanctioned
games, which means that our best
athletes are able to compete in
national competitions,” said Wade
Bendele.

In preparation of the games,
Chi Phi fraternity brothers go to
weekly practice sessions for the
athletes, attend meetings of Central
Susquehanna Valley Special Olym-
pics Committee (CSSO), and assist
in other CSSO functions. The fra-
ternity raises $5000 for the games
each year by soliciting local
businesses.

Also working with area chil-
dren, Sigma Chi participates in the
Big Brothers/Big Sisters program.
Ten fraternity members spend four
to five hours a week with little

brothers. The whole fraternity has
helped with the Big Brothers pro-
gram by hosting a barbecue after
one football game, by planning
Halloween and Valentine’s Day
parties, and by painting and remod-
eling the Big Brothers/Big Sisters
office.

Sigma Chi also helps Santa’s
Snippers, who support Susque-
hanna’s Women in Transitions. The
fraternity helps a needy family
from Lewisburg.

Money for Sigma Chi service
projects comes from the Sig Derby.

For its services Sigma Chi
received an award for philanthropic
excellence from the Interfraternity
Council.

The funds for Lambda Chi’s
service projects come from an
annual Lambda Chi Alpha Road-
race, held this year Oct. 13. Money
raised goes to the Food Pantry, run
through the First Baptist Church in
Lewisburg.

“The Food Pantry serves over
200 local needy families. Last year
the $1500 was used to buy turkey
dinners for people served by the
Food Pantry,” said Timothy
Amman, race organizer.

Last year Lambda Chi raised
$1500 from its race. This year, the
fraternity will be able to donate
$2000 to the Food Pantry.

The 82 brothers of Lambda
Chi spent a total of 500 hours on
the project.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE)
collects food for local churches,
visits an elderly persons home, and
tutors high school students. SAE
claims to be the firsi fraternity to
begin a recycling program on
campus.

SAE’s philanthropic concerns
are campus-wide. To increase alco-

hol awareness and faculty interac-
tion programming, the fraternity
initiates open forums on pertinent
topics.

The philanthropy office of
SAE has raised thousands of dollars
for local and national charities. The
money, last year, came from a soft-
ball marathon, which SAE co-
sponsored.

SAE, too, has been recog-
nized for its achievements. Last
year, the fraternity received its
eighth consecutive Chapter
Achievement Award. Two years
ago SAE won the Mosely Award
for Zeal, given to the best chapter
nationally.

The achievement Phi Gamma
Delta seems most proud of is the
collective 3.1 grade point average
of the brothers. Still, brothers com-
mit 2000 hours each year to com-
munity service.

From money raised at the fra-
ternity’s three on three hoops tour-
nament and Luigi Fiji, Phi Gamma
Delta contributed over $200 to the
Lewisburg food and clothing drive
and to the Lewisburg little league
defending champions.

Sororities, too, engage in
philanthropic projects. Beta
Gamma, which is Bucknell’s only
local sorority, received the Panhel-
lenic Award for Philanthropic
Excellence last year. The sorority
raises money for the Ronald McDo-
nald House in Danville. Beta
Gamma raises approximately $3000
each year towards the program; the
consistency of such funds has
allowed the sorority to agree to
donate $15,000 over the next five
years for room sponsorship at the
Ronald McDonald House.

Soviet anchorman reflects on

By Natalie Dunlap
Staff Writer

Boris Notkin, leading Soviet
television anchorman and com-
mentator, entertained members of
the Bucknell community in Rooke
Chapel on Monday, October 8 as
part of his five week lecture tour of
the United States. His lecture about
the culture and people of the
Soviet Union was followed by an
open question and answer session
and was sponsored by the Bucknell
Student Lectureship Committee.

Notkin is watched by over
40 million Soviet citizens as
anchorman and commentator for
the Soviet television program
“Good Evening, Moscow” which
is best described as a_ cross
between “Good Morning, Amer-
ica” and “60 Minutes.” He is a Pro-
fessor of Rhetoric at the University
of Moscow and holds a doctorate
in Soviet social history. In addi-
tion, he has published three books
and over SO articles on political
rhetoric and political psychology
and has served as an interpreter for
several U.S. presidents during their
visits to the Soviet Union.

Sitting informally at the front
of the chapel, he conducted his lec-
ture just as he does his television
program. Through his discussion
he attempted to answer the most
frequently asked questions about
the Soviet Union and its people
illustrating many of his points with
a joke. Following his lecture, he
welcomed questions from the audi-
ence establishing the motto, “You
ask me all the questions you like,
and I answer all the questions I
like.”

One of Notkin’s first focuses
was to explain who in the Soviet
Union is against change, or who
constitutes the  anti-perestroika
forces. He described the system
that Stalin created as _ being
“extremely easy to run” as com-
pared to the delicate U.S. system.
For 80 years, however, people fol-
lowing this system have opposed
democratic changes. Notkin used a
popular joke to illustrate the types
of leaders that the Soviet Union
has had and why change has been
such a struggle: “Stalin proved that
one can be in power as long as one
lives. Khrushchev proved that any-
body could be in power, and
Brezhnev proved that nobody
could be in power.”

He described three separate
groups that used to exist in the
Soviet Union as those at the top,
the semiconductors, and those at
the bottom. Those at the top gave
the orders and those at the bottom
had no impact on the decision mak-
ing. Those in the middle level were
called semiconductors because they
allowed the commands to go from
the top to the bottom but never in
reverse. Although these particular
groups do not exist as such in the
Soviet Union today, Notkin still
believes, “We have to completely
restructure the whole government
structure of the Soviet Union... of
the republics... the subordination.”

Another major point of inter-
est on which Notkin concentrated
was the enormous amount of short-
ages in the Soviet Union. He
described the Soviet Union’s eco-
nomic situation as “the worst
aspect of our restructuring through
perestroika”. The ultimate task is to
go from what has been called a
planned economy to a market econ-
omy. In the past, all economic
aspects had been planned by the
State Planning Committee. Here,
again, Notkin used a joke to dem-
onstrate the effects of this planned
form of economy: “What will hap-
pen if the State Planning Commit-
tee is moved to a desert? The
answer: At first nothing will hap-
pen. Then there will be shortage of
sand.”

Notkin noted that shortages
have never been as severe as
recently in the Soviet Union. In
January, there was no soap and
detergents. This caused the miners
to go on strike because they could
not wash after their shifts. Next
came the sugar crisis because the
whole country was engaged in
moonshining. At the onset of peres-
troika, the Soviet government
began a severe anti-alcohol policy,
very similar to the America’s Pro-
hibition. As Notkin revealed, “We
repeated all your blunders in Prohi-
bition—all, and had absolutely the
same results.” These results being a
rise in crime rate and moonshining.
Tobacco and bread shortages fol-
lowed these.

Notkin has his. own belief
about the sources of these short-
ages, “In my opinion, it is a combi-
nation of the old planned economy
plus inefficiencies of the new sys-
tem.” According to a public opin-
ion poll, many people in the Soviet

Union have their own views about
the cause of these shortages: 12%
blamed Gorbachev's _ perestroika,
18% blamed the planned economy,
33% thought the shortages occurred
as sabotage of the conservatives,
and 36% blamed the “shadow econ-
omy”, or black market, which con-
stitutes one-quarter of the economy
in the Soviet Union.

Notkin admitted, “I don’t
know still what is the reason of
these shortages or this wide spread
corruption, but I’m absolutely sure
that with any luck these facto-
ries...become private, we shall not
have this wide-scaled _ steal-
ing...because nobody has _ yet
learned how to steal from oneself.”
He further explained, “In all my
shows, I advocate and champion the
transition to real free market econ-
omy as soon as possible and to pri-
vate property as soon as possible.”
It is the conservatives who do not
want this transition. To them, mar-
ket economy is “‘a kiss of death”.

He has realized that the Soviet
Union “should not try to be unlike
everybody else.” Notkin pointed out
that the leading countries in the
world have many differences, but
they also have many things in com-
mon like democracy, freedom of
speech, private property, and free-
dom of religion. He described these
common aspects as “universal for
the prosperity of the nation.” He
believes that market economy is
also essential, “Without market
economy, you are bound to rot. You
are bound to stagnate. But if you
have it, it does not guarantee that
you will prosper.” A transition to

weeks, an annual round-robin rac-
quetball tournament, and two candy
sales produce the $3000 needed
each year to maintain the sorority’s
level of contribution to its
philanthropy.

The seven other sororities are
chapters of national organizations,
which often have their own philan-
thropies. “Our national philan-
thropy is Tri Delta Children’s Can-
cer Charity. Each chapter decides
the specific cancer they want to
work with; our chapter supports the
Geisinger Children’s Hospital in
Danville,” said Kim Higgins, presi-
dent of Delta Delta Delta.

For this project, the sorority
raises funds by selling mums for
Parent’s Weekend and candy apples
at Homecoming.

In addition, Tri Delta sisters
“provide assistance for an elderly,
invalid Tri Delta Alumna that lives
in Lewisburg,” said Higgins. And
the sorority raised $50 to buy an
acre of South American Rain For-
est. The acre has become part of the
Rain Forest Preserve.

Kappa Kappa Gamma’s list
of philanthropic projects over the
past year includes making “weekly
visits to the Lutheran Village to
serve meals and talk,” tutoring stu-
dents at Milton Jr. High School, and
co-sponsoring with Sigma Pi Epsi-
lon a Halloween party for children
of the community, according to
Becky Bunting, philanthropy chair.

Reaching beyond the Lewis-
burg area, the sorority “held a raffle
to raise money to sponsor a child in
Mexico,” said Bunting.

The sisters of Kappa Kappa
Gamma also plan to participate in
the upcoming dance marathon,
sponsored by Students Against
Muscular Distrophy.

changes

democracy and market economy
will not just happen by itself; the
people must work to make it grow
and to ensure its prosperity.

His lecture ended with an
explanation of a common miscon-
ception about why Soviets do not
smile. Actually, as Notkin
explained, it is not that Soviets do
not smile, but rather that there are
only two cases when Soviets do
smile. One is when they are very
happy to see a certain loved one,
and so they smile with joy. The
second is when something is
extremely funny. It is just a matter
of culture. In America, a smile
means politeness, and one that does
not smile is “hostile” or “mali-
cious.” Soviets should not be pre-
judged as hostile or malicious,
because in accordance with their
culture, they do not smile at
strangers.

Notkin does see good things
happening in the Soviet Union.
Gorbachev has recently been
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
There are many more religious
freedoms, and of course, there is
glasnost and freedom of the press.
Notkin is pleased that the Soviet
Union is not feared in the world as
it once was. He expressed a posi-
tive Soviet attitude toward Ameri-
cans and explained one of the ways
his country benefits from the U.S.,
“Americans are liked in the Soviet
Union. We tend to overlook your
problems ... your disadvantages,
and try to learn from your advan-
tages and your merits in order to
make life better in the Soviet
Union.”

waste incinerator in Union County
began circulating, the two sides in
the intensifying battle met face-to-
face for the first time in USPCI’s
first informational meeting on the
proposed $100 million project on
October 18.

Nearly 1,000 people jammed
the auditorium at the Warrior Run
Middle School to hear officials of
USPCI and its parent company,
Union Pacific Corp., explain
details of the facility, planned for
700 acres of land in Gregg Town-
ship, north of Allenwood, and allay
public concerns about the incinera-
tor’s safety. The crowd, which was
decidedly opposed to the plan, sat
somewhat patiently through a slide
presentation, but ten succeeded in
shouting down Union Pacific
Chairman Drew Lewis, when he
began to speak. Lewis was forced
to abandon his prepared remarks
and proceed directly to a question
and answer session when residents
began to take to the microphones
set up for that purpose.

Lewis was repeatedly ques-
tioned on the assurances of safety
are residents have in the plan, and
on the sincerity of USPCI’s inter-
est in public input on the plan.
During the September 21 press
conference to announce the pro-
ject, Lewis said USPCI would not
“try to jam things down [the]
throats” of area residents, a posi-
tion he reiterated during the meet-
ing, saying “‘we’re here to give you
the information to make a decision
with.” He explained that the infor-
mational meeting was the begin-
ning of a two-year process of pub-
lic hearings mandated by the
Pennsylvania Department of Envi-
ronmental Resources, in which the
company hopes to show residents
the incinerator “will be construc-
tive, and will provide approxi-
mately 1,000 jobs for the commu-
nity. [We want you] to realize it
will be a constructive part of the
community.” However, when
asked directly whether the com-
pany would abandon the plan in
two years if the public response
was still negative, Lewis
responded directly, saying “The

answer is no.” Lewis’ response
caused nearly one third of the audi-
ence to walk out of the auditorium
in protest.

When asked what assurances
of the incinerator’s safety the pub-
lic would have, Lewis explained
that, under law, Union Pacific’s
$12.5 billion balance sheet is on the
line for any damages caused by the
facility, and he dismissed sugges-
tions that the company post a bond
or place money in an escrow for
Gregg Township as further insu-
rance against environmental dam-
age or health problems in the area.
Lewis also said that “we cannot
remove ourselves from liability for
the site,” even is Union Pacific
were to sell either the facility or
USPCI. When asked how individ-
ual citizens would be able to bring
claims against USPCI if they feel
their health is damaged by the
incinerator, Lewis said only that
Union Pacific “is a responsible cor-
poration with responsible
management.”

When asked why Union
County was chosen for the inciner-
ator when most of Pennsylvania’s
hazardous waste is generated in the
southern half of the state, Lewis
explained that the site was chosen
because “it meets the geological
criteria, and because of the poten-
ual for economic development” in
the Susquehanna Industrial Park, of
which USPCI will be the owner
and anchor tenant.

The hostility evident at the
meeting has been building since
early September, when the Organi-
zation United for Ecology (OUE)
began organizing local support
against the proposed incinerator,
which would burn 70,000 tons of
organic hazardous waste per year
and feature on-site burial of the ash
in an above-ground ‘“monofill,”
preventing any contact with
groundwater supplies. Since the
plans were first rumored the Union
County Commissioners and nearly
every municipality in the county
have gone on record against the
plan, along with Union County
State Rep. Russ Fairchild and
Union County Economic Develop-
ment Director Bob Garrett. In addi-
tion, the Allenwood Fire Company
has said it would not guarantee fire
protection to the facility, which is
within its coverage area.

Quakers find unity in
silence and diversity

By Rob Schroeder

Imagine a typical Christian

church service. The preacher
preaches in a loud tone, instructing
the congregation, representing the
word of God. Passages are spoken
from the scriptures. Music can be
heard. The congregation’s
collective voice recites
prayers and sings songs.
The church is alive with
sounds and the spoken
word. Silence—except for
the few moments of sub-
dued prayer—is practically
shunned.

Now imagine, if you

can, a service with no
voices, no music, no
preaching and no sound.
The members of this con-
gregation simply sit in
silence. Before their formal
meeting its members do as
any other might do: chat
noisily amongst themselves
about their daily lives, greet
friends not seen since last
week, laugh and talk them-
selves into a closely-knit
community. But during the
meeting, the members of
this particular Society dis-
tinguish themselves from
any other denomination, by
sitting in complete and total
silence. I recently sat in on
one of these meetings of
the Religious Society of
Friends, a denomination
more commonly known as
the Quaker sect.

“Silence,” said former Buck-
nell religion Professor Gerald
Cooke, a member of the Society’s
Lewisburg meeting, “is for each
person to seek the divine in him-
self.” Professor Cooke and Eliza-
beth Marsh, (mother of Ben Marsh,
professor of geography) spoke can-
didly with me before the meeting
about the Quaker faith in general,
and about its similarities with other
religions. Mrs. Marsh stressed the
contemplative aspect of the faith,
equating the practice of silence
with Buddhist meditation. “Silence
itself is a kind of very simple ritual;

it gets everyday preoccupations out
of the way,” Professor Cooke
explained. He went on to tell me
that the notion of individual divin-
ity had Biblical roots, that God
breathed life into all creatures He
made. “Divinity,” Mrs. Marsh
went on to urge, “is in every

person.”

During the hour-long meet-
ing (service), I felt certain that
each of the nine members present
was trying to seek the divinity they
believed in. Though not a Quaker,
and not even religious, I experi-
enced a relaxation, a feeling of
community in that silence. The
meeting was held in the English
department library in Vaughan Lit-
erature Building, a soothing setting
perfect for the meeting. We sat in a
horseshoe-shaped arrangement, on
plain chairs. Some members’ eyes
were open, some were half-closed.

The hum of the air conditioner and
the ticking of the clock on the min-
ute every minute were the only
sounds in the library. People sat
normally in their chairs or in a
quasi-meditative position, with
their backs straight. All their faces
were introspective and thoughtful

Having attended Catholic services
earlier in my life, I got the sense
that the Quaker’s faith is not easily
adopted by those acquainted with
the kind of service imagined ear-
lier. For those used to sermons and
instruction, a silent Quaker meeting
might be uncomfortable. Another
tenet of the faith is the absence of
creed. To be a Quaker is to search
individually for spiritual meaning,
without organized guidance. Yet at
the meeting I attended, all of the
nine members had come to the faith
from different denominations. One
had been Jewish. One member was
even a former United Methodist
minister. The Society has drawn its
Friends since the 17th century. The
faith originated in England, and
has, since its founding, spread all
over the United States, with its
largest following in the Mid-west.
The Society’s heritage, though, is
strongest in the East. Pennsylvania,
in fact, was founded by a Quaker,
and still claims a sizable group of
Friends from among its residents.
There has been a meeting at Buck-
nell since 1953, Mrs. Marsh said.
While silence is the norm
at a Quaker meeting, expression is
encouraged. I was surprised to hear
the first, which came from Eliza-
beth Marsh. She spoke without
inhibition about an “awesome”

meeting of Friends in Philadelphia
she had recently attended. Through-
out her monologue she thoughtfully
talked about the Quakers’ associa-
tion with peace movements, disar-
mament, and their general opposi-
tion to war. As a group and as
individuals, she said, there is much
to be done. Addressing the
Situation in Iraq, Mrs.
Marsh claimed that the
“burden rests on any one
of us, any one of us could
be the next one” to be
called to fight. But she
then went on to talk about
a voice, “the voice of rea-
son, wisdom, the Divine
voice” that Quakers seek to
discover in themselves as
they sit and contemplate.
This voice of God that
Quakers believe to be
within them is what makes
up their opposition to war,
and concerns them with
humanitarian struggles. I
was told of the Society’s
involvement with foster
child programs, their oppo-
sition to capital punish-
ment, and the extensive
amount of other commu-
nity services and volunteer
work that is done. Locally,
Friends work with Susque-
hanna Valley Women in
Transition, and hold meet-
ings and study sessions at a
nearby prison. Quakers are
“not unaware of what other
people’s plights are,” said
one woman. “The time we
spend in meeting, with ourselves,”
claimed another member, “helps us
realize what’s important and helps
us respond when there are
callings.”

During and after the meeting
the subject of what a Quaker is and
does was brought up frequently. By
the end of my stay with these
unique people I found it indeed
“hard to put [my] finger on what a
Quaker is,” as member Juanita
Bishop said it would be. Yet even
though opinions differed and
debate actually occurred after the
meeting, there was definitely the
“unity in diversity” that Mrs,
Bishop spoke of. Clearly the unity
was created by the collective
humanitarian concern, and the
belief that “there is that of God in
every person,” and that “every per-
son has that core goodness inside of
them.” Silence, the main tool of the
Quaker, is for finding just that.

Note: Though there happened
to be no Bucknell students at the
meeting I attended, Mrs. Marsh
informed me that Bucknellians do
come from time to time, and are
always welcome. The meetings are
held Sunday mornings from 10:30
to 11:30 am in the Department of
English library, in Vaughan Litera-
ture Building.

Dear Wanda

Dear Wanda,

Someone on my hall is
constantly coming into my
room and asking to borrow
things (food, clothes, tapes,
etc.). That would be fine with
me but it’s like pulling teeth
to get anything back. When it
is returned, it isn’t always in
good condition. I don’t know
how to refuse when she asks
for something - what can I
do?

Pushover

Dear Pushover,

You will have to be asser-
tive if you want to keep your
belongings. You may feel rude
or uncomfortable saying no, but
it sounds as if your hallmate has
no consideration for you or your
Possessions. There are a number
of ways you can handle the situ-
ation. One method is to tell her
that when you have lent her
things in the past, it has been
difficult to get them back.
Explain that you would rather
not lend your belongings under
these conditions. If you don’t
want to be deadly serious, keep
your tone light to let her know
you aren’t angry. If she takes
you by surprise, tell her that you
were planning on using the
belonging or that someone else
is using it. Good luck!

Dear Readers,

Here are some more
uncomfortable situations and
how to handle them:

1, The Leech. That ran-
dom person who is forever skip-
ping class and wanting to bor-
Tow your notes. Explain that:

-you had dozed through
class and you didn’t take notes

-your handwriting is illeg-
ible and show a sample

-you’re going to Spain
next semester and you take all
your notes in Spanish

-it’s against your religion to
share your intellectual ideas

-you feel that it’s unfair to
miss class so much while you go
every day

2. The Excuse. You slept
through your eight o’clock and
attendence was mandatory. Here
are some original excuses:

-your roomate eloped to
Peru, taking all of your clean
underwear

-the Caf ran out of Captain
Crunch and you were forced to
wait until a new shipment arrived

-you had to stay in your
room to hear the New Kids on the
Block Hour on the radio

-someone had Crazy Glued
your door shut

-you felt you needed more
time to fully reflect on the
assignment

For your specific classes:

Archaeology 100 - you
found a dust bunny under you
bed that appeared to date back to
the 1800's, it had to be studied
and catalogued

Psychology 100 - your Id
had taken control of your mind
and you could not fight your urge
to retum to bed

Philosophy 100 - as you
were leaving for class you had a
flash of insight into the tue
meaning of life and you had to
write it down (then the paper
spontaneously combusted)

Spanish 100 - you needed
to fly to Spain and get in some
practice before class

Biology 100 - the month-
old leftover ravioli that was in the
corner of your room mutated into
a camiverous life form, you
needed to study it under a
microscope

Bison

By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

Well, it’s 12:00 and I think
1 would like to spend the next 20
minutes getting hit on the head
and shoved into walls by my fel-
low laid-back —_ Bucknellians.
Time to check mail! So I clutch
my 462 page version of The
Odyssey, which my English Pro-
fessor has told the class to study
while noting use of alliteration,
(there’s something about English
professors that really scares me)
and use it machete-style to chop
a path through the polite people
who have determined that a
packed mail room is an ideal
place to peruse postcards or
engage in leisurely conversation.
I haven’t had this much fun
since the time I got wedged in-
between the Ritz Bits and the
Very-Fine Fruit Juice while
waiting on line at our spacious
new “Temporary” Bison. When I
reach the correct alcove, I kick
aside the piles of What's Hap-
pening? tossed on the floor and
crouch down to peer inquisi-
tively inside my box. What’s
this?...some kind of red card...
Oh my God... It's telling me I’ve
got a PACKAGE!! YEAHHHH!
I snatch the precious pink parcel-
purveying particle and enthusias-
tically squeeze through the
swarm of students in an attempt
to reach the front desk and claim
my prize!

After I replace the stupid
slip which turned out to be for
my box-mate, I head into the
Bookstore to cheer myself up by
doing some discount shopping.
Wow, look at this! Cotton boxer
‘shorts...normally sold at K-Mart
for 97 cents but you can get
them here at the B.U. Book-
store, with little miniature Bison
printed on them, for the bargain
price of just $27. Or, if you're
not into having large brown
mammals plastered proximate to
your privates, you can invest in
this attractive orange and blue
B.U. Golf Umbrella yours for
just...(ha ha) don’t even worry
about it! Charge it now, and fret
later! Just remember to pay your
bills on time, or else they will
send Bucky to your room with
his. special orange and blue B.U.
brass knuckles....

So I wander amidst the
orange and blue (of course) B.U.
lingerie until finally I break
down! I find myself heading
toward the back of the establish-
ment....1 am approaching the
spot which contains the ever-so-
tempting yellow and_ black...
CLIFF NOTES of the classics.
And how about this...ONE 43
page version of The Odyssey just
crying out for some eager young
student to take him away from
the terrible store and give him a
home. This wonderful learning-

Tales

aid could acquaint me with all
nuances of the distinguished and
enlightening epic...in less than
twenty minutes. Now I can
watch “Santa Barbara” later
today.

But hold on for one sec-
ond! My English Professor
encouraged the class to be free
thinkers...which basically means
(according to the content of his
lectures) that we should relate
everything in the story to sex. I
don’t need any help to do that.
Although, I guess I was kind of
disillusioned on the first day of
class when he strolled into the
room and began asserting the
REAL meaning of the thor in
Sleeping Beauty. Next, we dis-
cussed Cinderella’s eagerness to
loose her “Glass Slipper.” Our
professor ended the lecture by
proclaiming, “I’m not saying that
Snow White was a tramp, but
every morning she woke up feel-
ing Dopey!”

Throughout this semester, I
have learned that there is an
entire universe of phallic sym-
bols...besides the one in front of
Vedder Hall. Swords, daggers,
feathers, grass, aerosol contain-
ers, and fireflies can all be seen
in a different light. I now no
longer give my papers bland
High Schoolesque titles like
“Twain’s Use of Colors” or “The
River as a Road.” My first A in
the class was awarded to me
when I wrote an essay entitled
“Huck’s Brief Flirtation with
Nymphomania, and Jim’s use of
the Sexual Trinity to put Huck
back on the ‘Blue’ (calmer) Path
of the River.”

I guess I do wonder,
though, why every single lecture
in class seems geared towards
our dangling modifiers. Does the
professor enjoy seeing the entire
class shift uncomfortably, as the
men casually lift their books
onto their laps? Well... proba-
bly, but I’m just disappointed
that no one ever pointed out to
me sooner that reading anything
besides those digest-sized maga-
zines on the top shelf of the mag-
azine store (the ones with inter-
esting and  thought-provoking
stories like, Rub a Dub Dub, 17
People, 8 Parakeets, 3 Rolls of
Plastic Wrap, and a Can of Tuna
Fish in a Gatorade filled Hot
Tub,) could be so educational! I
guess I never realized how many
great authors there are besides
Nameandaddress Withheld. You
know, now that I think about it, I
kind of like my English class...
and my professor!

I continue to contemplate
the countless joys of the classics
as I carry my purchase to the
counter...a bag of M&M’s to
munch as I read my 462 pages.
“Santa Barbara” can wait.

Lee Idleman discusses

views of campus issues
Chairman of the Board of Trustees talks about the Greek system,

social alternatives, admission drops and more...

By Sue Basalla
Staff Writer

Current chairman of the
Board of Trustees, Lee Idleman,
sits back comfortably in his chair
while speaking articulately and
confidently of the “simpler” days
he spent at Bucknell in the 1950's.
Graduating in 1954 with a B.S. in
commerce and finance and a minor
in history, Idleman remembers the
less complicated times when, as
assistant to the athletic director, he
could easily call up the head of
sports at Temple and work out a
mutually convenient time for a
home football game. Idleman also
reflects upon the years he spent in
KDP fraternity, living downtown at
120 6th Street doing “his share of
underage drinking.” As I question
Idleman about the state of Bucknell
today, his aspect changes and a
look of concern shadows his face.
Immediately putting all nostalgia
aside, Idleman concentrates on
explaining his role in creating uni-
versity policies that will be accepta-
ble both to students who protest
infringment on their rights and to
society which demands greater
conservatism.

What was the situation with
alcohol and the Greek system in
the 50's?

“About 2/3 of campus were
Greek...In the best of my memory,
life was simpler to the extent that
there was an unwritten rule that the
campus was private property. thus
there was no pressure on the admin-
istration to end drinking per se
except as it interrupted activities or
as people got out of control...I think
to some extent there was less drink-
ing because it wasn’t quite so dar-
ing or exciting to do it...Today it
seems to be almost a dare situa-
tion.../n loco parentis applied at
that point....In the 60's and 70's
those rules disappeared and every-
one was free to do what they
wanted and the school had no
authority or obligation so the pen-
dulum swung very far in that direc-
tion. Now it’s come back, and
we’re expected to exercise a degree
of control; we’re required by fed-
eral and state law and we find our-
selves in the unfortunate position of
having to administer very unpopu-
lar laws.”

What did the fraternity
mean to you while you were here
and how did it change after-
wards? What would you say to
the students witholding Senior
Gift Drive donations in protest of
Greek system changes?

“As the chairman of the
board, of course, I’m interested in
collecting whatever we can...but I
have to be realistic about it to real-
ize and to recognize my own feel-
ings and attitudes as you asked in

your question. I was glad to get out
of here. Four years of study seemed
endless, there was always an
assignment hanging over your
head, Lewisburg seemed small and
confining and, as you say, to the
extent that your loyalties at that
point really hadn’t been formed or
shaped very well and I think it
takes later years to come to the
realization of what you have gained
from it and what it did mean to

Maybe we should be doing that
three nights a week in order to give
them an outlet and have some kind
of constructive activities without
always seeming to come to the
lowest common denominator of 18
year-olds drinking more than they
should.”

On admissions drops:

“We're a little concerned

you. My family moved around a
great deal when I was young and I
skipped a grade, so I came to Buck-
nell as a fairly young 17 year-old.
For me, the fraternity was a home
away from home in the sense of
establishing some roots with a
group of people who were ready-
made built-in friends. I don’t feel
that I was excluding other people; I
have several close friends who
were not Greeks, one was my
freshman roommate and we’re still
very close....there is no question
that that is a group I can identify
with, but I feel that Bucknell
comes first and the fraternity
comes second in terms of your loy-
alites and your committment.”

On social alternatives:

“I happened to have a chance
to catch the tail-end of the concert
(Little Feat] last night and I was
very pleased to see an awful lot of
kids seeming to have a very good
ume in a non-alcohol environment.

about admissions drops in the past
couple years which may be related
to concerns about social activites
as well as demographics and
prices. I think students need to be
aware that this same problem is
occuring at lots of other schools,
both in and out of Pennsylvania.
They’re not alone in being perse-
cuted at the moment. Society in
general has decided that they don’t
want teenage drinkers at this point.
This may change; we went through
an era when no one was allowed to
drink, the . Prohibiton Era...
They’ve changed the voting age,
the drinking age, the driving age,
but unfortunately, or whatever you
want to call it, the students here
today are in this time warp and
unfortunately society today does
not want teenage drinking and we
are expected to enforce those rules.
It's awkward and unpleasant and
difficult, but there doesn’t seem to
be much choice about it.”

Moving away from the
Greek issue, I understand that

there is a new landscaping plan
being developed.

“We have retained a firm to
do a master plan of the cam-
pus...The campus used to face the
downtown area.. now it faces more
toward Route 15. It’s changed the
sightlines, some of the older trees
are dying—a variety of things need
to be addressed to improve the
visiblity of the campus.”

Why is an attractive cam-
pus important and how can you
justify spending funds to make
an already beautiful campus
more beautiful when there are so
many concerns about not enough
financial aid, not enough diver-
sity and about retaining faculty?

“The plan may involve a
commitment of major funds over a
number of years, but whatever we
do it must fit within the operating
budget, be practical and make
sense. We spend a_ substantial
amount of money every year on
maintenance—we try to renovate
one of the dorms every year...
think you’re aware of the stadium
renovations. That was over a mil-
lion dollars but I think most people
would agree that was a well-spent
sum in view of the attractiveness
which that former eye-sore gives us
in one of the main entrance areas of
our campus. We weigh all these
decisions. Financial aid is certainly
important...As we have increased
tuition we have increased financial
aid even more.”

If you could change one
thing overnight, what would you
do?

“IT would like to see that
today’s students can study and
leam and play hard and enjoy them-
selves without having alcohol as a
part of it. It may be Utopian; it’s
what society is asking at the
moment and requiring of us. I
guess that the sooner the students
get that message and move to ty
and make the best of it, the happier
they’ll be and can get on with a
more positive outcome. It’s very
painful, I enjoyed my years here
when there was less pressure on
these issues and I did my share of
underage drinking but that does not
excuse the issue or tell you where
we are today. As a result, we have
no choice but to recognize that this
is the law of the land and hope that
we can defuse the adversarial rela-
tionships which don’t serve anyone
very well...We’re looking to the
students to help design a fabric of
social life on this campus, more
special interest groups, more
unique and different housing
arrangements, more activi-
ties...whatever will serve to create
a more positive Bucknell experi-
ence for our students.”

Wine, Dine and
well...never mind

With Julie Bachman and Steve Hoerter
Staff Writers

Shannon's

Sunbury
988-1907

As Julie and Steve wound their way down a woodsy gravel
road toward Shannon’s Restaurant, the mood was quite anticipatory.
The premises of the final destination were rather quaint and invit-
ing...for a moment they might have been in the Great North Woods
of Wisconsin, But, upon entering, things went frighteningly awry.
Their first clue should have been the simulated hardwood carpeting
on the floor. The second clue should have been the way the menu
was organized...categorically by price. Instead of listing entrees
under “chicken,” “seafood,” or “beef” categories, surf & turf would
be listed under the $18.95 column. WHAT A CLASSY JOINT.

You have probably gathered by now that the ambiance of this
place is rather dismal and tacky. The tables are arranged like a mess
hall on an Army base and the floor is in fact covered with the worst
carpeting you could find. In all fairness, it should be noted for the
record that even though Julie and Steve are elitists, they did enter this
restaurant with a positive, tolerant and receptive attitude.

Julie chose to dine on the ever-popular Chicken Peaches &
Cream, (The $7.95 version...yes, there were two versions.) Accompa-
nying this mysterious dish was a salad, served “family style,” in a
bowl large enough for a sumo wrestler to bathe in. The entree also
came with choice of vegetable and potato.

In retrospect, Julie commented that her meal was “interesting
and different...but not something to be recommended to the more dis-
ceming dining patron.” The salad was hearty...but the thousand
island dressing lacked any special quality.

Steve, too, could not resist the intriguing and enigmatic sound
of “Chicken Peaches and Cream.” His response was quite similar to
Julie's, yet Steve decided to take it one step further by issuing a word
or two of warning to perspective diners: “Do not eat the chicken and
peaches at the same time. It confuses the palate.”

Julie and Steve thought they might have stumbled on to the
perfect alternative dining experience for fellow Bucknellians. Unfor-
tuneatly, the only good thing that can be said about Shannon’s is that
they serve a good Genny Light and do not seem to care about your
age. Julie and Steve do not recommend Shannon’s and assign a mea-
ger, yet charitable, two Bison to the establishment.

The Campus Theater: A
shared piece of history

By Donna Walsh

Many Bucknellians routinely
take advantage of the ready-made
study break found in the form of
the Campus Theater. While at the
theater, students can forget their
worries and cares, abandon their
books for a few hours, and dream
about Julia Roberts or Patrick
Swayze. Lewisburg townspeople,
as well, frequent the old-fashioned
movie-house. Since its establish-
ment in Lewisburg, though, the
Campus Theater has been much
more than a source of entertain-
ment. The theater has had an inter-
esting history within the commu-
nity, and its proprietors have come
to occupy a significant role both on
campus and in town. Yet, this sense
of history can hardly be experi-
enced during a two-hour movie!

The Campus Theater was
originally owned as part of a nine
theater chain located throughout
Pennsylvania. The owners were
four immigrant brothers living in
the Philadelphia area who had
found themselves, by some strange
fluke, in the film industry. Mr. Har-
old Steifel, a son of one of the orig-
inal owners, eventually took over
the theater in Lewisburg, and ran it
in addition to a second theater, also
located on Market Street. After
closing the second movie-house,
Mr. Steifel concentrated his efforts
on the Campus Theater, which still
remains in the Steifel family.
Today, Mr. Steifel’s widow, Jackie,
operates the Campus Theater from
the very same desk that has been
used since the theater was built.

As proprietor of the local
movie-house, Mr. Steifel became a
well-known figure in the commu-
nity. Patrons remember him best as
standing in front of the theater, next
to the parking meter, and saying
“hello” to movie-goers as they
bought their tickets. After his death
in 1988, patrons donated a bronze

star, reading “Harold Steifel Stood
Here”, They placed it in the pave-
ment in front of the theater, next to
the parking meter, in remembrance
of Mr. Steifel’s habit of greeting
his customers.

The Steifels were  well-
known in the Bucknell community
as well. Mr. Steifel, who was a
Bucknell graduate and Sigma
Alpha Mu brother, served as
advisor to Sigma Alpha Mu for 35
years. Mrs. Steifel characterizes
this relationship as an active one,
recalling that her husband attended
each of the fraternity’s meetings
and that they both acted as chape-
rones for Sammy’s parties in years
past.

The Campus Theater has also
demonstrated its dedication to local
charities and needy causes. For the
past three years, the Theater has
been hosting an annual charity
show in Mr. Steifel’s name. Mr.
Steifel had always expressed an
interest in the community, and was
dedicated to making improvements

where he could, so the charity
shows were designed as a tribute to
him, Past shows have benefitted the
public library and the Evangelica
hospice. The third annual charity
show was held this past week, and
the proceeds will benefit the Sus
quehanna Valley Women in Transi
tion. Volunteers from the Bucknel
community and from Lewisburg
cooperate to make the annual bene-
fits a success. Regarding this con
tinued service to the community in
her husband’s name, Mrs. Steife
said, “He would well approve of
that.”

With the annual charity show
just over, the Theater will soon be
in preparation for the next big event
—- the 50 year anniversary of the
Campus Theater in Lewisburg. It is
actually quite remarkable that such
a theater has survived the trend
toward malls and large movie com-
plexes. Despite changing trends in
the industry, however, the Campus
Theater has remained virtually the
same in many ways during the past

The 50-year old marquee of the Campus Theater is the original one
which was installed when the theater was built.

50 years. The facade bears the orig-
inal orange and blue colors in
honor of the university, and the
foyer is still decorated with bison
and athletic figures. The marquee is
the original one erected 50 years
ago. Much of the interior also
remains unaltered, and the conces-
sion stand has even resisted change
in that it was never redesigned to
incorporate an ice machine!

Despite the aforementioned
similarities, the Campus Theater
has witnessed some changes over
the years. The second floor, which
is no longer accessible, was once a
U.S.O. during World War II. The
young Army and Navy men who
were in training programs at the
university, as well as the women
studying there, used to come to
socialize on the second floor of the
theater. More recently, a Bucknell
Management 101 Company made
some improvements to the inside of
the theater as part of its service pro-
ject last year. Mrs. Steifel noted
that the theater was just equipped
with a “wrap-around, stereophonic”
sound system, which would
enhance the sense of realism in the
picture. She is also planning to
repair the seats and do some paint-
ing in the theater before the anni-
versary celebration in January.

Although there are very few
of the large, old-fashioned theaters
still in existence, it seems as if the
Campus Theater will face contin-
ued success in Lewisburg. Mrs.
Steifel said that people seem to
‘enjoy the ambiance of the whole
place.” Moreover, there is a shared
sense of history between the thea-
ter, community, and university. So
if you’re in search of a mode of
procrastination, take a walk to the
Campus Theater and take a step
backward in time to look at a part
of the history of Bucknell and
Lewisburg.

Actors succeed: Ibsen falls short

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

The swirling pattern of politi-
cal and personal conflict of Ros-
mersholm saw both its realization
and undoing on the Coleman Thea-
ter stage in a parents’ weekend pro-
duction of Henrik Ibsen’s drama.
Despite fine acting on the part of
the Bucknell company and expert
directing by Bob Gainer, it was
clear that the ambitious Ibsen, often
considered the father of the realist
genre, had crafted a play which
took a theater company beyond lim-
its of reason and credibility.

A drama that had spiraled
upward with wondrous tension and
intensity for three acts, collapsed
under its own weight in the fourth
leaving the cast unable to salvage
the emotion and anxiety which had
undergirded the entire structure.

Yet, the Rosmersholm script,
particularly in the first three acts,
did create moments of anxious
beauty which allowed the cast to
match Ibsen’s writing with their tal-
ents. The performances of Mary K.
Cullison as Rebecca West and
Andrew Garman as John Rosmer
were particularly noteworthy. Dur-
ing Monday night’s performance
both actors were able to fully
embody their characters in almost
flawless performances which went
far beyond stage direction and sug-
gested the passion and turmoil
which tormented the souls of West
and Rosmer.

Garman effectively conveyed
the rarified passion of Rosmer as
the bourgeois intellectual. The soft-
ness of his voice and frailty with
which he held his body allowed
Garman to create the aura of a man
who would necessarily retreat to the
certainty and comfort of the ideals
of his family tradition. Indeed, John
Rosmer came alive in all his sad
beauty and weakness in Garman’s
performance.

It is the character of West
upon which the entirety of Rosmer-
sholm’s action tumed and Cullison
performed this crucial role quite
well as she was able to render the
many nuances and subtleties exhib-
ited in the multifarious character of
Rebecca West. It was West’s devel-
opment as a character which guided
and determined Rosmer’s path and
her personal history and acts which

provided the network of intrigue
which undergirded the immediate
context of the drama.

Cullison was brilliant is this
crucial role; her voice was meas-
ured and calculatedly appealing as
she directed the thoughts and
words of the other characters. Cul-
lison’s strength was her ability to
convey meaning and emotion
silently with a gesture or the subtle
changing of her posture. The
expressiveness of Cullison’s eyes
and facial features belied the calm
of her voice and exhibited the
social turmoil in which she and the
other characters were engaged.

As the play faltered in the

consumed in the horrific necessity
of West and Rosmer’s suicidal act,
could only laugh, albeit a bit
nervously.

Director Bob Gainer, com-
menting on Ibsen’s script, said that
while the play is realistic in charac-
ter, there is a strong element of the
Poetical; the last act, then, would
represent a poetical leap and not an
incongruity in a realistic structure.

“Although the play is realistic
in form, the accumulation and pro-
gression of the actions of the char-
acters are metaphorical and poetic
in nature and artificially represent
the change of consciousness in the
characters lives,” Gainer explained.

“Rosmersholm” was performed on campus last week by the Depart-
ment of Theatre and Dance. Pictured here are Mary Cullison ’91 as
Rebecca and Andrew Garman ’91 as Rosmer.

fourth act, Cullison and Garman,
along with the rest of the cast,
remained consistent and strong in
their roles while, unfortunately, the
writing itself unraveled their char-
acters. In this final scene the inter-
meshing of private and public, the
realms of the emotional and intel-
lectual, resolves itself as West and
Rosmer are compelled by the spir-
its of tradition and the guilt they
invoke to forsake their professed
ideals.

In the final moments as West
and Rosmer walk arm in arm
toward the swift water of the mill-
race in order to sacrifice their lives
where Rosmer’s wife Beata, at the
prompting of West, had months
before, the tragedy became absurd.
Tbsen’s characters strangely
offered melodrama in the place of
tragedy, words came forth which
seemed sudden and mechanical,
and the audience, rather than being

Speaking
“Specific Blights”

By Lee Guzofski
Staff Writer

Hello Bucknell! I hope you
all had as wonderful a break as I
did. I hope everyone got the
opportunity to take in a fine fea-
ture film or two. Well, I sure did!
I saw Pacific Heights, starring
Matthew Modine, Melanie Grif-
fith, and Michael Keaton. It was
an interesting movie, to be sure,
but it did have a few specific
problems...

Modine stars as a sheepish
husband named Drake Goodman,
Griffith plays his girlfriend, and
Keaton delivers a stunning por-
trayal of the villain Carter Hayes.
The plot centers around Modine’s
character trying to prove that he
is the man about the house and
will take care of everything. That
is, everything after the fact that
the couple has sunk themselves
deep in a financial hole after pur-
chasing their dream home (a
“unique fixer-upper opportu-
nity”). In essence, they are mort-
gaged up to their respective
wazoos and have placed all of
their time, effort, and love into
this house. Enter Keaton...

Michael Keaton’s character
is indeed what makes this film.
He plays a man who is incredibly
intelligent and makes his living

off of using other people, so
much so that he generally ruins
his victims’ lives. The character
of Carter Hayes is so compel-
lingly evil that the entire move
eventually revolves around him.
Quite a far cry from Mr. Mom
and Batman...

However, the movie is just
too bizarre, blatant, and random
to ever really succeed. For exam-
ple, Modine’s character, the hero,
is named Goodman. He lives in a
beautiful all-white house in a
friendly, “Howdy neighbor” type
town. Then we have Keaton,
whose entrance is made driving a
black Porsche, appearing over a
hill. Please... My favorite part of
the film comes when the Home
Shopping Club is on TV offering
a “Faux Pony Desk Set”, that’s
right, a desk set covered in faux
pony fur. The desk set, analogous
to the film, is intriguing, differ-
ent, but a little too blatant and
weird to be of much value. In
summation, this film is interest-
ing, but not worth full price. Kea-
ton’s performance does, how-
ever, make it a possibility
whenever it come to the Campus
Theater. Have a nice yesterday
and a pleasant next Thursday.

“The very extravagant theatrical
gesture of the suicide represents the
poetic and symbolic climax of the
play.”

Tbsen’s writing, though, was
inadequate in suggesting the poten-
tial of the characters of West and
Rosmer to make such poetical
leaps. There are minor intimations
of the extreme act that concludes
the play such as West’s statement
as the end of second act that she
may “go the way go the way Beata
went.” But these words are quite
inadequate to suggest the severity
of character would be necessary to
determine suicide to be the proper
response to their responsibility for
Beata’s death.

Aside from these deficien-
cies in the script, all other aspects
of the production—including the
preparation of the set and the light-
ing—were of a professional
quality.

Speaking after the week-
end’s performances, Gainer lav-
ished praise on the cast. “Ibsen
knew that he was creating very psy-
chologically complex characters
and I was pleased with the ability,
commitment, and talent that the
Bucknell cast brought to their roles.
I was impressed and edified by the
Bucknell cast.”

Indeed, it is precisely the
complexity of Ibsen’s characters,
the twisting and intertwining of
identities into a creative fabric, that
makes Rosmersholm a drama of

WU

Enjoy these

interest. As a result the actors, espe-
cially Cullison and Garman, had to
not only define their own charac-
ters, but enter into a creative
dynamic of revelation; each charac-
ter being continually recreated and
the actors necessarily being in tune
with this growth and in a sense play
a number of characters.

Rosmersholm is a social
and psychological drama set within
the social and political turmoil of
Norway in 1886. At Rosmersholm,
the family seat of the clerical Ros-
mer family and a bastion of local
tradition, the struggle between the
forces of theoretical liberalism and
conservatism takes concrete form.
John Rosmer and Rebecca West
attempt to create a new and enlight-
ened life for themselves in, as Ros-
mer states, a “sense of calm and
happy innocence” and Rosmer
makes preparations to “create a lit-
ue light and happiness in those
places where for so many years the
Rosmer family has created nothing
but darkness and misery.”

Yet, while West and Ros-
mer profess their faith in a new
humanity, they do so under the
gaze of the family patriarchs and
matriarchs whose portraits hang in
the parlour.

This plan for a new and
liberated life is confronted by the
character of Dr. Kroll, authentically
rendered by Tom Quinn. The loud
and crude Kroll, the brother of the
deceased Beata, undermines West
and Rosmer’s plan with his conflic-
tual ideology, his knowledge of
Rebecca’s questionable past with
her mentor Dr. West, and the ghost
of Beata that he bears with him.

Ultimately it would be
these rememberances of the past
that would undo both Rosmer and
West as they both take their life in
order to atone for their past acts, to
appease the shades that haunt Ros-
mersholm. As West said in the first
act, “its the dead that cling to
Rosmersholm.”

Kroll, then, represents the
audible voice of the past, of tradi-
tion, which not only opposes Ros-
mer and West, but condemns them
and their dreams. Quinn effectively
presented the rhetoric of Kroll,
replete with abrasive and somewhat
hysterical voice of a Norwegian
conservative fearing that “discord
and subversion” was on the verge
of dissolving traditional society. If
Quinn’s performance could be said
to be lacking in any manner, it was
that his creation of Kroll’s charac-
ter through facial expressions and
gesture which was not on par with
his verbal presentation.

The focus of Rosmer-
sholm, though, was the intellectual
and emotional development of
West and Rosmer and the demise
of their notions concerning human-
ity due to the corrosive force of tra-
dition. To this end the lesser char-
acters of the play served to further

Alumnus performs in
Weis center tonight

By Cynthia Levinson
Staff Writer

Hang your hat on home-
coming and go straight to the
Weis center tonight! Alumni and
students alike should find
tonight’s opera-in-concert perfor-
mance of Handel’s Acis and
Galatea of great interest for more
reasons than one.

Handel’s two-act operatic
pastoral was written in 1718. It is
the “tragic story of the sea nymph
Galatea and her lover, the young
shepherd Acis.” Galatea is also
loved by the jealous Polyphemus,
but his love is not returned by
Galatea. For this reason, Polyphe-
mus crushes Acis beneath a boul-
der. The grief stricken Galatea
transforms Acis into a river bear-
ing the same name.

The empassioned opera will
be conducted by noted conductor
and Bucknell graduate of 1973,
Rudolph Palmer. Palmer was a
music major at Bucknell and is an
active alumnus. He is an
acknowledged expert in Baroque
repertory, and has taken a special
interest unearthing, performing,
and recording a number of rela-
tively unknown works. Some of
these works, such as Baroque
Cantatas as Versailles and
“Romantic Handel Cantatas”
have received quite a bit of
acclaim in the music world.

As a musician, Palmer
appears quite frequently in con-
cert. He plays the piano and organ
and is also a member of the con-
ducting and composition faculty
of the Mannes College of Music.
In addition, Palmer functions as
associate conductor for the Fair-
field County Chorale. He has
composed quite a number of
pieces, some of which were com-

the character development of West
and Rosmer, prefiguring and guid-
ing their movement toward self-
realization.

The minor characters of
the production were all rendered
with talent and a concern for
authenticity. Emery as Mrs. Hels-
eth, William Lippincott as the aes-
thetic anarchist Ulrik Brendel, and
Joshua D. Brinen as the liberal
Politico Peter Mortensgaard all
complemented the central charac-
ters in addition to their solid indi-
vidual performances.

Lippincott and Emery had
the difficult task of portraying
aging characters as Gainer chose
to use a Cast entirely composed of
students. Makeup and costume
could not quite render the youthful
Lippincott aged, but his clever per-
formance certainly brought out the
eccentric and tragic hollowness of
Brendel’s revolt against tradition.

missioned for the New York Bas-
son Quartet, the Amor Artis Cho-
rale and the Fitzwilliam String
Quartet.

Tonight’s performance of
Acis and Galatea will feature the
Brewer Ensemble of original
instruments, soloitsts Julianne
Baird, tenor Grayson Hirst, tenor
Frederick Urrey, and __bass-
baritone John Ostendorf. The
Rooke Chapel Choir will also be
featured in tonights performance.
They will be conducted by Wil-
liam Payn, an associate professor
of music here at Bucknell. This
opera will be the first performance
in the Weis Center’s Reverbera-
tions Series.

Tonight’s performance will
begin at 8 p.m.. Tickets are availa-
ble at the Weis Center Box Office
for $20. Everyone is encouraged
to attend. It is a special occaision
when Bucknell is able to feature
its own students, faculty, and
alumni in a_ performance along
with other noted musicians and
performers. The entire production
should be one of a very high cali-
bur and is definitely worth seeing.

Emery also had difficulty
in taking on the weight of Mrs.
Helseth’s years at Rosmersholm,
with more spring in her step and
flair with her duster than we would
have expected of the older woman
the script seemed to demand.
Indeed, Gainer opted to accentuate
Emery’s age and remake Mrs. Hels-
eth as a young maid. While Emery
was placed in a difficult in this dif-
ficult position Gainer and Ibsen she
performed well and effectively
evoked the white horses of Rosmer-
sholm and placed the dead continu-
ally before West and Rosmer,

In the role of Mortens-
gaard, Brinen was consistent and
emanated the solidity and practical-
ity of the politician who knew the
political struggle to be, not one of
ideals, but power and influence. As
a freshman, Brinen shows promise
and should be seen often on the
Coleman Theater stage.

taking a “could care less” attitude toward student life, morale at Bucknell has sunk to new lows.

The Trustee Implementation Planning (TIP) process continues to mystify most students. While rumors about
changes run rampant, TIP subcommittees have yet to publicly announce any proposals for implementation next
fall. Students, and the entire University Community, are in limbo, not knowing whether they can sign leases for
apartments in town or how their Greek organizations will be affected a year from now.

Security and Safety continues to be seen as a threat, rather than an entity with our safety and security in mind.
Students question why sexual harrassment on the golf course receives little attention in comparison with the Uni-
versity’s unyielding breaches in enforcing the alcohol policy. From the reaction of security officers, it is clear that
a very significant rift has developed between the student body and the Department of Security and Safety — rifts
that should have never been allowed to develop and seemingly grow larger day by day.

For the first time since the divestment demonstrations of the early ‘80s, students are coming together to confront
the administration, only this time the issues are closer to home. Many students view the administration as the new
“evil empire” and are displeased with what they see as its inaction on students’ issues.

Survey results released today indicate a clear drop in student satisfaction with both Bucknell and several key
administrators. All of these factors add fuel to the fire and yield a potent result — widespread and overwhelming

dissatisfaction.

But are these perceptions accurate?

A close look behind the scenes reveals an administration that is not just concerned with student morale, but one

that is actively pursuing the answers to our problems.

Bucknell is in a state of transition; with vast changes in our social-residential system underway, we must realize
that confusion and misunderstanding are common components of the process. Through TIP, the University is
attempting to dispel rumor and replace it with fact. It is only a matter of weeks before students will be getting

their first glimpse of what the Bucknell of the ‘90s will look like.

With a new director in place at Security and Safety, changes are already underway. A permanent advisory com-
mittee is being formed to look into the day-to-day operations of security and recommend changes. Our new direc-
tor has demonstrated in a short ten days that he is concerned with the mistakes of the past and addressing the con-

cerns of the present.

Changes seem to be underway on all fronts.

As the Universtiy Community pushes through these months of transition, students must begin to see the light at

the end of the tunnel.

Be assurred that your needs and concerns are being addressed by the administration. In the weeks ahead changes
in structure and practice within our University will readily become apparent.

Now, however, is not the time to stop. Continue to voice your concerns, but with the realization that our adminis-

tration is genuinely concerned and willing to act.

Flexible benefits program proposed by
Administration needs a second look

By Mark Leister
Staff Writer

A very important decision
must be made in the near future
by Bucknell employees. A propo-
sal to change the present
employee benefits system to a
new “flexible
benefits” —sys-
tem has been
put forth by the
Administration
and a_ great
number of peo-
ple simply do
not understand
the potentially
unfavorable ramifications of the
new system.

Most traditional _ benefits
programs require each employee
to contribute a set amount to the
program; that
divided by a previously devised
formula and every employee gets
the same amount of coverage in
each area.

This system presents prob-
lems, however, because not every
person needs the same amount
and type of coverage. For exam-
ple, some employees may have
spouses with outstanding medical
benefits. Why should the Buck-
nell employee have to pay a per-
centage into Bucknell’s medical
plan? It’s wasteful.

Enter, flexible benefits.
Since each person has different
needs and desires, this option
allows employees to determine
where their funds will go. For
example, more money can be
pushed into a dental plan while
less can go to the medical plan.
Even better is the aspect that if
you don’t think you need a large
amount of coverage or you have
other coverage, you can cancel
your Bucknell benefits plan. It
sounds great—but there’s one

MY GOD! LOOK WHAT THEY
PRINTED IN THE

money is then:

important flaw.

Insurance and benefits are
based upon one necessary element:
a payout coffer. Participants pay
premiums which go into this fund
and the insurance company pays
bills out of it. Since the majority of
this money comes from the healthy,

It is possible that with an exodus of
employees from Bucknell’s program and
consequentially diminished funds, (the
insurer) could decide that Bucknell is

simply too great a risk.

there is nothing more important
than keeping the young, low-risk
employees in the program because
they contribute necessary funds into
the coffer while removing very lit-
ue themselves.

Young, healthy people pay
into the system as a means to two
important ends. First, they protect
themselves for the future; money
paid in while they are young and
healthy will be used to take care of
them when they get older. Second,
the money that is
paid by healthy
folk comprises the
main body of a
fund out of which
claims are now
paid. This system
is ancient and
proven. By
encouraging the young to protect
their futures, society has been able
to care for the sick and elderly.

The flexible benefits pro-
gram, however, could very well
undermine this time-proven system.
For example, as young, low-risk
people begin to leave the Bucknell
program, the monetary foundation
begins to disappear, leaving only
those who need Bucknell’s benefits
or consider themselves to be at

serves only to sap valuable time.
TIP also operates under the
spirit of compromise; no one
involved in the program will get
exactly what she/he wants. The key
is understanding the other point of
view. The faculty needs to under-
stand that they cannot educate in a
vacuum. The construction of a Uto-
pia has little worth when its lessons
cannot be practically applied
“beyond the bubble.” Likewise, the

students must learn to see through
the faculty’s eyes; if students do
not attend this University primarily
to learn, what purpose do they have
here, but to detract from the learn-
ing of others?

TIP is attempting to establish
a middle ground, with concessions
to both sides and an idea of a clear
social structure to strive for—one
that supports the best that society
has to offer, including input from

high-risk for illness. Instead of the
fund staying relatively full, it
begins to decline—no one knows
exactly how fast, but it declines
nonetheless.

What is the reaction? The
insurance company realizes that if
the foundation dwindles away to
nothing, it will
soon be paying
Bucknell
employees’
claims out of its
own pockets. Its
only recourse is
to raise the pre-
miums of those
still in the sys-
tem. This increase can lead to a
two-fold effect. First, Bucknell’s
system becomes less and less com-
petitive because its rates keep ris-
ing—much to the dismay of Buck-
nell’s employees, this gets very
expensive and it causes even more
people to seek better rates else-
where. Second, if the premiums
can’t increase fast enough for the
insurance company to feel it has a
secure fund, it will cancel Buck-
nell’s plan altogether.

At last Monday’s faculty meeting,
many professors admitted to having
little understandin

tem’s ramifications.

This may sound like an exag-
geration, but it isn’t. The fact is, the
College of the Holy Cross in
Worcester, Massachusetts is deal-
ing with this problem right now.
They implemented a program simi-
lar to the one Bucknell is proposing
with comparable flexible options
and the identical provider, Blue
Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS).

The problem developed
because BCBS requires a certain

make

of the new sys-

level of “employee involvement”
from the insured _ institution.
When this level goes below a cer-
tain minimum limit the insurance
company cancels the program.
The College of Holy Cross is dan-
gerously close to that minimum
limit and BCBS sees that its pay-
out coffer is getting too low. If the
college isn’t careful, it could have
its benefits program dropped.

The harsh reality of this
example is that this situation
could very well occur here. Buck-
nell is dealing with the same insu-
rance company and a system
which would allow low-risk indi-
viduals the option to leave part of
the plan, It is possible that with an
exodus of employees from Buck-
nell’s program and consequen-
tially diminished funds, BCBS
could decide that Bucknell is sim-
ply too great a risk.

But this situation would
arise years from now and some
people simply don’t realize how
far ahead one must look to see
flaws in a system. Others, how-
ever, have been able to sense the
problematic nature of the flexible
benefits system.
At last Monday’s
faculty meeting,
many professors
admitted to hav-
ing little under-
Standing of the
new system’s
ramifications.
These statements are  proof-
positive that there needs to be
more discussion of the proposed
system among Bucknell’s
employees before a decision is
made.

The new flexible benefits
package has its advantages...and
its disadvantages. Make sure you
know what you’re getting into,
before you get into it.

It is here that TIP has its
greatest difficulty: we cannot draft
appropriate members of the campus
community—we can only hope that
they will choose to participate. If
there is concern among the faculty
that Greeks will dominate the com-
mittee on Greek life, it is fruitless
to avoid the issue and point to the
committee’s recommendation as
biased after the fact. The faculty

must be involved from the outset.
Each recommendation will be

committee meetings; if a segment
of the community has no input, it
has no one to fault but itself if the
TIP results seem unappetizing.

represented in the program: faculty

Picture it: burger boxes
outlasting the pyramids

By Paul Shrivastava

Each year we generate more
than 150 million tons of garbage, in
the form of 250 million tires, 2 bil-
lion disposable batteries, 28 billion
glass bottles and jars, 50 million
tons of paper and 18 billion dispos-
able diapers. We then dump these
materials into one of our overbur-
dened waste sites where they sit for
hundreds of years. This year 50%
of our cities will run out of landfill
space to store these treasures. We
are in the throes of a garbage crisis.

The worst part of this prob-
lem is that we are headed down the
wrong track to its solution. Corpo-
Tations, government agencies and
environmentalists have enthusiasti-
cally endorsed the idea that recy-
cling is the solution. This is wrong-
headed for two reasons. First,
actual levels of recycling in the
United States are abysmally low.
Less than 5% of garbage generated
is recycled. We generate more trash
each month than we recycle each
year.

Second, all this talk of recy-
cling has conditioned the American
public to believe that it alone is
responsible for the problem and for
finding the solution. Consumers are
not the source of garbage; they only
discard the excess that manufactur-
ers put into products. Waste disinte-
grates so slowly because most
products and packages are highly
over-engineered by manufacturers.
Primary responsibility for the solu-
tion should be in their hands, where
it rightly belongs. They design the
containers that are built to outlast
the pyramids. Certainly, it is easier
to regulate a few thousand manu-
facturers than to coordinate the
recycling efforts of 200 million
consumers.

Recycling is a useful idea
that needs to be encouraged, but
should not be mistaken for a solu-
tion. Besides, it is impossible to
effectively recycle _ significant
amounts of waste without investing
in an expensive recycling infra-
structure. Countries like Japan that
have developed successful recy-
cling programs have done so by
providing a variety of laws, moni-
toring agencies, municipal services,
equipment, personnel and informa-
tion to make them work.

Recycling also__heavily
depends on action by citizens. This

most important groups. They will
bear the effects of the recommenda-
tions long after the rest of the
present student community is gone.

We are not asking that every-
one on campus join a committee,
but we do need to hear more ideas.
All committee meetings are open—
attend one and give an opinion or
an idea.

We want the new recommen-
dations to fit the campus easily, not

dependence on voluntarism is the
Achilles heel of the entire idea of
recycling. Let’s face it. Can a soci-
ety in which less than half the peo-
ple vote or fill out census forms be
expected to voluntarily recycle its
garbage? Probably not.

The real solution to the gar-
bage crisis lies in not generating
unnecessary garbage in the first
place. Product manufacturers think
of disposability as producing inex-
pensive and short-life products that
consumers can afford to simply
throw away. They need to rethink
this concept. Product design should
seek to minimize not only the cost
of the product, but also the cost of
disposing it. The real cost of dis-
posing a product, such as a tire or
battery, is incurred over hundreds
of years of its useless life in land-
fills, and may be more than the cost
of the product itself.

Packaging manufacturers
need to design materials that are
relative to expected product life. If
the time taken from production to
consumption of coffee, or deter-

gent, or soft drinks, is six months,
do we need to wrap them in mate-
ial that lasts for 500 years?

Consumers can help by sub-
stituting disposable products with
renewable ones whenever possible.
In fact, renewable products often
turn out to be less expensive in the
long run. For example, used over
five years, an electric razor costs
about $15 per year. Disposable
razors cost about $35 per year and
also generate 750 pieces of plastic
and metal, as opposed to one piece
of waste from an electric razor,

If we fail to implement effec-
tive garbage control strategies, we
may invite the fate envisioned by a
satirist paraphrasing Robert Frost:

Some say the world will end in fire

Some say in ice,

Some say it will go with the bang of
a big explosive device.

But at the risk of sounding
Sarcastic,

I say the world will choke on

Football champs of 1965 honored

By Darren Millman
Staff Writer

When the 5-2 Bison football
squad returns to Christy Mathew-
son-Memorial Stadium tomorrow to
clash with the Red Raiders of Col-
gate, it will also represent the
homecoming of a Bucknell football
team from years ago. At halftime of
the game, the university will be
honoring the 1965 Middle Atlantic
Conference champions as they cele-
brate their 25 year reunion.

The 1965 Bison went 6-3,
continuing the winning ways of the

the year before. Head Coach Car-
roll Huntress directed the Bison to
their first MAC title in his first sea-
son at Bucknell. Huntress went on
to coach at the University of Ken-
tucky and then moved to the pro-
fessional ranks as an assistant
coach for the New York Jets.

Tight end Tom Mitchell 66
concluded one of Bucknell’s most
illustrious athletic careers, catching
59 passes for 850 yards and six
touchdowns. Mitchell still holds

Injuries:

An athlete’s greatest fear

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

In the 1988 NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and the
L.A. Lakers, Isiah Thomas of the Pistons hobbled his way around the
court as he played with a severely sprained ankle. Most people would
have been on crutches for days. Similarly, Lawrence Taylor of the
New York Giants played several football games last year with a
broken ankle. Under normal conditions, Taylor would have been in a
cast for weeks. Scenes such as those just described raise several
important questions that pertain to more than just professional sports.
High school and college players are limping onto sports fields each
week despite the risks of serious injury. Unfortunately, the reasons for
these common occurrences are not completely clear, and the chances
that change will occur are very slim.

The problem of athletes playing with serious injuries is one that
is not only relevant to professional sports. The Bucknell football
team, just like any other college athletic program, places a great
amount of emphasis on winning. As a result, the pressure that exists
to perform well undoubtedly filters down from the coaching staff to
the players. Each player knows in the back of his mind that injuries do
not help the team; consequently, they attempt to cover up those inju-
ries that will keep them out of the next game. Often these injuries are
more serious than the player is aware of, and more damage could be
done than what he thinks is possible.

Mike Augsberger ’91, a free safety, is an example of a player
who might have become permanently hurt had he not have listened to
the Bucknell trainers. In a game earlier this season, Augsberger
injured his shoulder, but he felt that the problem was not that serious.
After being checked by Mark Keppler, Bucknell Head Athletic
Trainer, the senior felt that he should be allowed to play because the
pain was tolerable. Keppler and Associate Athletic Trainer, Barry
McGlumphy, diagnosed that nerve damage had been done to Augs-
berger, and that if he continued to play could be detrimental to his
health. Though he protested, said McGlumphy, the co-captain now
realizes that it would have been foolish to play.

While it is clear that there is a strong desire to play in a game
though injured, the reasons why are not quite as understandable. Den-
nis Barnes ’91 is a player whose football career at Bucknell is over as
a result of a tear in the anterior cruciate ligament of his right knee. His
experiences with playing injured have led him to formulate a theory
about the question of why there is such a strong desire to play hurt.
“You really have to love the game,” said Barnes. “Sometimes players
aren’t ready to give it up. When you’re in the game, the pain is not
that bad. You block it out. It’s the next day that it hurts. You just have
to learn to suck up the pain.”

McGlumphy agreed with Barnes that players have a remarkable
ability to block out the pain. “It depends on the player, and whether he
has the ability to overcome physiological pain,” said McGlumphy.
“I’ve seen some players that become so intense you can’t even talk to
them during the game.” McGlumphy feels that the sentiments of
players like Barnes, are what ends player's careers, as they develop a
sense of being “invincible.”

“Athletes tend not to look at the ‘countability factor,’” said
McGlumphy. “Players do not realize that we are responsible for them.
They don't look down the road. All they see are the immediate
rewards. They know that once the playing days are over, the glory's
all gone.”

As a result, McGlumphy added, players lie to the trainers about
not having injuries in order to not miss games. “They will make their
own decisions based on passed experiences with injuries,” said
McGlumphy.

The trainers have an important role in the decision about
whether a individual should be allowed to play or not. There are sev-
eral factors which enter into the decision of the trainer because they
are accountable to some degree, should a player have a major injury
in a game in which he should not have played. One point for the
trainer to consider would be the field of study for the players. For
example, a medical student with a fractured finger would be less
likely to be given the go ahead over a psychology major due to the
need for dexterity in the medical field. Another factor would be the
pressure from the coaching staff for a particular player to be on the
field come Saturday. Often the desire to win is more important than
the player's comfort during a game. This is not to say, however, that a
coach would send a player on the field if it were known that perma-
nent damage could result. Basically, if the trainer is aware of the
injury, it is up to him to give the players permission to play each
week.

Clearly there is a wide ranging problem throughout the country
with athletes either lying about injuries, or simply ignoring them
while they place themselves in great danger. The rewards evidently
outweigh the negatives in the eyes of the players, as the immediate

glory is ultimately more powerful a force than the pain one feels after
the game. There are hidden risks involved that most athletes are not
aware of, however, as the trainers are more qualified than the players
to assess conditions such as nerve injuries. Unfortunately, it is only a
matter of time before a seemingly trivial injury becomes a tragic fatal-
ity, and the athletic community will finally wake up.

The Oakland Raiders of the
American Football League signed
Mitchell in 1966, and he went on to
enjoy a long and successful profes-
sional career, predominantly with
the Baltimore Colts.

Defensive back/quarterback
Bob Marks °67 described Mitchell
as “the cream of the crop. He had
good speed for someone 6-3, 220
pounds.” Mitchell and Marks both
earned the honor of being named to
the All-Pennsylvania team.

“Multi-faceted” was the word
which Marks chose to describe the
1965 Bison, and judging from the
fact that no less than six Bucknell

players were members of the All-
Conference squad, his assessment
holds true.

Mitchell, tackle Paul Maczu-
zak '68, center Geoffrey Traub ’66,
defensive end Ed “Bub” Morgan
"66, defensive lineman Jim Henn
"68, and Marks represented the
Bison on the All-Conference team.

Bill Lerro '66 utilized pin-
point passing to complement his
drop-back quarterbacking _ style.
Lerro completed 93 of 171 passes
for 1303 yards and four
touchdowns.

Coach Huntress utilized the
skills of Marks to spell Lerro and

keep opposing defenses off bal-
ance. Marks’ roll-out style allowed
him to complete 29 of 45 passes
for 379 yards and eight touch-
downs. He also rushed for 249
yards on 42 carries with five
touchdowns.

Tailback Bob Coons ’66 led
the Bison ground game running for
662 yards and seven touchdowns
on 153 carries en route to the MAC
rushing title. When he wasn’t
recovering from injuries, tailback
Bruce Smith ’68 rushed for 379
yards and four touchdowns on 88
carries.

Other

standouts included

light end Ron Kinsey ‘66, who
hauled in 33 passes for 455 yards
and one touchdown, and Don Len-
hard ‘67, who caught 12 for 188
yards and two touchdowns.

The members of the team
will have no shortage of exciting
memories to recall as they come
together 25 years later. The high-
light of the season was the victory
over Delaware in which Marks
orchestrated a fourth quarter 97-
yard touchdown drive to clinch the
MAC title.

At least twenty players are
expected to attend the Homecom-
ing Day ceremonies.

Joe Markulike ’90 takes
his shot at pro baseball

By Chris Drowne

According to New York
Mets scout Pete Smith, “About
one out of every 10,000 Little
Leaguers makes it as far as the
minors.” Bucknell's Joe Marku-
like '90 beat those odds.

Signed as a free agent this
past June, Markulike played for
the Idaho Falls Braves of the Pio-
neer League. This single-A short
season introduces players to the
roller coaster life of professional
baseball.

Late night bus trips from
Salt Lake City, Utah, to Medicine
Hat, Canada, wear on the players,
as well as performing on bug-
infested playing fields.

But they do it for the
“moments in the sun,” such as
signing an autograph on your own
baseball card for a young fan, giv-
ing hitting clinics, and putting on
a professional uniform.

The decision to play with
the Braves was not as easy as
most would think, Markulike, a
GTE Academic All-America from
1988 - 1990, declined a substan-
tial job offer from General Elec-
tric in favor of the league mini-
mum $850 per month.

Marulike said, “The G.E.
offer was tough to pass on, but
my grandfather, uncle, and other
members of my family passed up
their shots to play baseball
because they had to work. I didn't
want to miss my shot.”

The long bus trips provided
some of the more memorable
moments of the season. While
traveling to Salt Lake City for a
crucial game in the pennant race,
the bus was forced to pull over to

the side of the road around 1 a.m.

due to low air pressure in the air §

brakes. After an unsuccessful

attempt to fix the problem, the bus- §

driver and an
walked to try and call for help.

When they failed to return,
the manager sent Markulike and
another player out to find them,
which they did. The clock showed
6 a.m. before another bus would
pick the team up for their game.
Understandably, the Braves com-
mitted countless errors in helping
Salt Lake City to an easy win that
afternoon.

The Williamsport native
attracted many scouts to Bucknell
with his .395 career batting aver-
age. In his senior season Markulike

finished fourth in the nation in bat- §

“ProCards®

ting with a .454 average, as well as @

in the top ten in triples.

The Chicago White Sox had §
shown the most interest but didn't

draft him after selecting a number
of middle infielders in the early
rounds.

Markulike is still not positive
about his future. He's currently tak-
ing graduate courses in mechanical
engineering at Bucknell. After this
semester, he will likely go to work
for General Electric.

One future event that Marku-
like is sure about is his upcoming
marriage to fellow Bucknellian Tif-
fany Cook in June.

“If (the Braves) call me up
and tell me that they want me to
play for them, I might return,” said
Markulike. “But there are many
factors that made me believe that
the minor league lifestyle wasn't for
me.”

Among other Bucknell gradu-
ates, former teammate Ted Aceto

Markulike ’90 has realized what for most is just a dream as he is pic-
tured here in his own professional baseball card.

‘89 was just recently released after
playing for the Columbia and Port
St. Lucie Mets. Andy Nezelek '87
is still pitching for the Braves AAA
team in Richmond.

Markulike concluded, “If I

don't play again at least when I'm
older I'll be able to say that I gave
it a shot.” That shot at playing pro-
fessional baseball fulfilled Marku-
like’s dream, a reality that few Lit-
tle Leaguers experience.

PatriciaWay ’94 dribbles away from a Delaware opponent during the Lady Bison's scoreless tie with the

18th-ranked Blue Hens.

Women’s

By Anne Taback
Staff Writer

The Bucknell women’s soc-
cer team continues to struggle as a
varsity squad in its inaugural year
of play, as the Lady Bison lost two
games before Fall Break, falling to
Elizabethtown and Penn State. The
consecutive defeats of these two
games drops Bucknell’s record to
1-6 for the season. Elizabethtown, a
nationally ranked powerhouse, was
probably the toughest team the
Lady Bison will have to face all
season, but the Penn State game
proved to be a game that Bucknell
will remember as “the one that got
away.” Bucknell will hope to break
its losing streak today when it hosts
Lehigh at 7:30 p.m.

Although Elizabethtown got
the win, the Lady Bison played
extremely well in defeat, losing 1-0
The first and only goal of the game
came at 22:55 in the first half, when
Elizabethtown marched through the
Bucknell defenders, as the Lady
Bison simply misjudged the ball
After many Bucknell defenders had
a chance to make a play, the ball
rolled to Lady Jay forward Jocelyn
Jarzynski, who blasted a shot from
six yards out for the game-winning
score.

The Elizabethtown game
marked the only contest all season
in which Bucknell has been held
scoreless. However, Head Coach
Toby Lovecchio was optimistic.
“We played hard,” he said. “We
held a good offensive team to one
goal.”

“If we had ten more minutes we

Penn State proved to be a dis-
aster for Bucknell. On paper, the
teams appeared evenly matched,
but the Nittany Lions dominated
for a 2-1 victory

Lovecchio said “We played

Kathleen Sullivan ’92 and Kara Forosisky ’92 stretch for a block
against Cornell. The Big Red crushed Bucknell 15-4, 15-5, 15-6 to
drop the Lady Bison's record to 3-14 for the season.

The first goal came for the
Nittany Lions at 17:00, when for-
ward Amy Convoy took a cross
from the left wing to score. Their
second goal came late in the half,
when Penn State forward Dina
Dinacci scored on a rebound off
Fekel at 43:00.

Down 2-0 as the second half
started, the Lady Bison played bet-
ter. But the Nittany Lions were still
passing better and winning all the
“50-50 balls.”

Bucknell was able to avoid
the shutout with less than six min-
utes to go in the game, when Por-
caro chipped a direct kick from
twenty-five yards out that
descended into the penalty area.
Midfielder Julie Cooling °94 col-
lected the ball, and from eight
yards out, put the ball into the back
of the net at 80:00.

Lovecchio commented, “It
was an even team, no better than
us, with the same kind of talent we
have. From my viewpoint they
wanted it a lot more than we did
We had decent scoring opportuni-
ties that were negated, but our
defense in the first half wasn’t as
solid.”

Baselga assessed, ewe
played a very slow game and we
were caught off guard. We’re ten
umes better than Penn State but we
couldn’t put it together.”

Porcaro agreed. “We just fell
apart,” she said. “We couldn’t do
anything right.”

The Lady Bison clash with
Lehigh today. Lovecchio finds,
“Lehigh is no better than the Lady
Bison, but we will have to play
well if they expect to win. We have
to get back on track and be men-
tally prepared.”

Volleyball

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The volleyball team went into
Parents’ Weekend with an overall
record of 2-10, (0-2 in the Patriot
League), and was in the middle of a
seven-game losing streak. With the
meat of their schedule coming up
including some key conference
match-ups, the Lady Bison would
have no time for rest if they were to
make their move.

Bucknell had seven games
altogether, including rival Patriot
League foes Holy Cross and
Fordham.

Bucknell started with LaSalle

Field hockey bows
to Lock Haven 3-0

By Julie McCausland and
Scooter Van Kirk
Staff Writers

The Bucknell field hockey
team lost to Lock Haven yesterday
3-0, as the Lady Bison continue
their up-and-down season. The
defeat to the Lady Eagles drops
Bucknell’s record for the season to
4-10-1.

Lock Haven dominated the
action, out-shooting the Lady Bison
27-14 on the afternoon. Bucknell
goalkeeper Danielle Ward ‘93
posted 13 saves against the 1989
Division III National Champions.

The Lady Bison played well
October 20 against Delaware, the
#18 ranked team in the nation,
holding the Blue Hens to a double-
overtime 0-0 tie. Three days earlier,
Bucknell defeated Towson St 2-1
in a hard-fought battle in poor field
conditions. Bucknell’s superior
defense was anchored by Ward,
who was awarded Patriot League
Player of the Week for her efforts.

Last week’s torrential rain
postponed the team’s game against
Drexel. The victory against Tow-
son was a “sloppy” win according
to Coach Jen Averill. “It’s a W[in]
in my book,” said Averill. “I’m
content, but I know we can put out
a much better effort than that.”

The Lady Bison were leading
1-0 at the end of the first half on a

goal by co-captain Jeanette Aurand
‘92. The score was assisted by
midfielder Dana Bruce ‘92. Com-
ing out strong after intermission,
Bucknell scored three minutes into
the second half to go up 2-0.
Defenseman Katrina Mucller ‘93
was assisted by Aurand for the
tally.

Coach Averill gave acco-
lades to Aurand, who came back
after an carly injury to play the sec-
ond half, when she assessed, “This
victory was in large part due to
Jeanette’s heads-up play.”

The Tigers quickly retaliated
and scored on a goal by Lisa Gray,
assisted by Sue Bloomstead,
shortly after Bucknell’s second
goal, to finish the scoring.

Towson hounded Ward who
picked up 17 saves, with 21 shots
on goal. Though Bucknell’s
offense was sparse (8 shots), it
came up with the conversions to
put the team ahead.

Bucknell was to play Drexel
last Saturday but the game was
postponed to next Monday. The
Dragons (5-8-1) are still hungry for
a win against Bucknell, who
defeated them last year. The game
is scheduled for 3:30 at Bucknell
West.

After their 2-1 win over
Towson the Lady Bison hosted
East Coast Conference powerhouse
Delaware (7-5-3). Playing its sec-

ond NCAA top-twenty team in
three games, Bucknell distinguished
itself with strong play and excellent
defense.

In the past Bucknell and Del-
aware have matched-up well, and
Saturday was no exception. Averill
commented, “Delaware played an
excellent game which forced our
Players to raise their level of
intensity.”

The teams battled to a 0-0 tie
after two ten-minute overtimes, giv-
ing Delaware its third tie of the sea-
son and Bucknell, its first.

Ward was shelled with thirty-
five shots on goal and twenty-two
defensive corners. With an incredi-
ble performance, Ward tallied a
career-high 22 saves, and she also
earned a .975 save percentage for
the week (39 saves) giving her a
total save percentage of .889. Ward
is within .01 of the Patriot League’s
top goalie, and has a 1.71 GAA
posting 193 saves this season and
recording two shutouts.

After facing Drexel on Mon-
day, Bucknell is off to play Ursinus
(7-8-2) October 30 in Philadelphia.

It has been confirmed that
Alison Arth ‘93 will not be playing
for the remainder of the season
Arth injured her ankle during prac-
lice, and Almira Baldwin ‘94 is out
for the remainder of the season as
well after an ankle injury sustained
during practice.

hosts Lehigh, Lafayette

\They ended up losing the fourth
game 15-13 and the final game 15-2
despite the strong efforts of their
co-captains Kris Colbert ‘91 and
Kara Forosisky ‘92, who had 10 and
14 kills, respectively.

Bucknell’s luck changed for
the better against St. Francis. Hav-
ing already defeated St. Francis ear-
lier in the year, Bucknell’s confi-
dence was evident in its
performance on the court.

Aggressive play was demon-
strated when setter Dee Scinta ‘92
quick-setted Colbert for several
smashes at the net. When Scinta
wasn’t setting Colbert, she was
dishing up assists to Meg Kinney
‘92, who put down 10 kills for the
match. Bucknell took the match in
commanding fashion 15-4, 15-13,
15-10.

“Coming in to the weekend
we knew we could play with St.
Francis because we had beaten them
before,” said Coach Opalski. “But it
was disappointing to lose the
LaSalle match after having played
them so close.”

After putting the losing streak
behind them, the Lady Bison set out

for Lehigh. The next three games
should be in the bag if we can get
our heads together. I think that we
need to play with a lot more inten-
sity, and Lehigh is going to be a
complete turnaround.”

to tangle with their Patriot League
foes, Holy Cross and Fordham.
Like so many of Bucknell’s
matches this year, they played each
team close but wound up on the
short end of the scoreboard. Holy
Cross wasted little time after losing
the first game 16-14 by taking the
next three 15-3, 15-12, 15-8.

The Lady Bison took Ford-
ham to the maximum five games
before losing, 15-5, 9-15, 15-6, 13-
15, 15-10. Mary Jordan ‘93 played
well, combining for 19 kills and 4
service aces.

“Holy Cross and Fordham are
along the caliber of St. Francis,”
said Opalski. “We definitely could
have won, but we tried to do too
much to quick and consequently we
lost.”

While trying to recover from
the two league losses, Bucknell
traveled to Gettysburg last Monday
to play matches against the host and
Susquehanna University. © The
smaller schools were up to the chal-
lenge, as Gettysburg eased through
the match with a three-game win
15-5, 15-8, 15-10, and Susquehanna
was victorious in five games 15-5,

The Lady Bison must focus
on playing a complete game. Lovec-
chio summarized Bucknell’s top pri-
ority: “The game is ninety minutes,
not just the first half, We need to be
more consistent.”

tomorrow

15-5, 12-15, 7-15, 15-12.

Colbert led all Bucknell hit-
ters with twenty kills in the two
matches and Sara Mesaros ‘93 per-
formed tremendously from the serv-
ing line with five aces.

“We just did not play well at
all against Gettysburg and Susque-
hanna,” commented —_Opalski.
“These are two teams we definitely
should have beat.”

“Right now the key to us
doing well is to eliminate the
unforced errors,” continued Opal-
ski, “because that is what kills us.
We have to stop looking at our
record and constantly assessing
what we have done so far; instead
we have to set goals for ourselves.
They don’t have to be big goals,
Just lite ones, like right now we
are looking for our first conference
victory, and after that we will look
to the Patriot League
Championships.”

The Lady Bison will have a
chance to reach their first goal
tomorrow when they take on the
Lady Leopards from Lafayette at 11
a.m., and then will also face Lehigh
in Davis Gym at 1 p.m.

Water polo sweeps MAC tourney

Polo squad hosts alumni game tomorrow at 11 a.m.

By Scott Pollins
Staff Writer

Led by interim coach Jim
Harvey ‘88, Bucknell’s water polo
team stormed to victory two week-
ends ago at the Mid-Atlantic Con-
ference Tournament held at M.LT.
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Coach Harvey was put in charge
when Head Coach Lynn Kachma-
Tick left for the week to play with
the United States Women’s
National Water Polo squad in
Budapest, Hungary.

The #1 seeded Bison first
Played #8 seed Villanova. Led by
great defense, Bucknell jumped out
to an 8-2 halftime bulge. Harvey
gave his younger and Icss experi-
enced players abundant playing
time in the second half, as Bucknell
breezed to a 15-9 victory. Danny
Brown ‘93 and Tim Smaldone GR
led a balanced Bison attack of
which eight players scored. Brown
and Smaldone registered three
goals apiece.

Bucknell next played Army.
Captain John Zeigler ‘91 had been
injured in the previous game, so
Harvey replaced him with scasoned
veteran Mead Briggs ‘91. Briggs
rose to the occasion by leading all
scorers with four goals and an
assist.

Not only were the Bison
without Zeigler, but another one of

their top players, Kevin Shroth ‘92,
got into carly foul trouble. AJ. Zot-
tola ‘92 stepped in and played a
key role in the 10-7 Bucknell vic-
tory over the Cadets. John Brad-
bury ‘92 tumed in a tremendous
performance in goal, recording nine
saves.

Bucknell then advanced to
the championship game against
familiar foe Princeton. It was just
three weekends ago when the Bison
took the Tigers to sudden death
before winning 9-8. The team knew
they would have to play a great
game to win.

Going into the game, Harvey
instructed his players “to stay
focused and play intense.” Once
again, Bucknell played great
defense and surged to a 5-1 half-
time lead.

The relentless Bison defense
ured Princeton quickly as the Bison
counter-attack scored most of the
first half goals. Late in the third
quarter, Brown got into foul
trouble.

Zouola once again came in
and played a key role. Zottola put
away a crucial goal at the end of
the third period to put Bucknell up
6-3. The Bison played a strong
fourth period and won the game 10-
7 to capture the championship.

Shroth led Bucknell with
three goals and an assist. Brown
netted a goal and three assists,

while Smaldone and Walter Kelly
“92 registered two goals and two
assists apiece. Bradbury played
another outstanding game in goal,
yielding only seven goals and net-
ting 15 saves.

Harvey stressed, “The key to
Our success this weekend was
defense.” Finishing first in the tour-
nament, Bucknell upped its overall
record to 11-7,

Over Fall Break, the polo
squad traveled to Villanova, to play
four MAC games. The Bison faced
Army, Navy, Iona, and Fordham.

Bucknell played Army Octo-
ber 20 and came out a little slow,
struggling to a 5-3 halftime deficit.
Kachmarick motivated her team to
perform better in the second half.
The Bison responded by outscoring
Army 7-2 in the final two periods
to complete an impressive come-
from-behind win 10-7.

Shroth led Bucknell with
three goals and four assists. Return-
ing from a brief injury hiatus, Zei-
gler scored three goals. Bradbury
tumed away ten shots, while yield-
ing only seven goals.

The Bison next played a
strong Navy squad. The Cadets
jumped on Bucknell early and
rushed out to a 3-2 lead after the
opening period. But the Bison
refused to give in. Bucknell
thrashed Navy in the second and
third periods, outscoring them 6-2.

Kelly led the Bison with five goals
and an assist. Shroth added two
goals and two assists. They cruised
to a deceivingly close triumph 11-
9. Since giving top-ranked Cal-
Berkley a tough match several
weeks ago, the Bison had gone 11-
1.

Bucknell’s third game of the
day was against arch-rival Iona.
Both teams played a tough and
even first half. The score was dead-
locked at 5-5 after two periods. The
Bison played a valiant second half,
but ended up bowing to Iona 10-7.
Shroth ied the team with three
goals and an assist.

Coming off a tough defeat,
Bucknell next played Fordham on
Sunday moming. The Bison
wasted no time venting their frus-
trations, crushing Fordham 13-5.

Zeigler led the onslaught by
scoring two goals and four assists.
Shroth added three goals and three
assist, and Kelly registered four
goals and an assist. Bradbury gave
up goal duties for the game to
Smaldone. He responded by allow-
ing only five goals.

This weekend, the polo
squad will be treated to a home
match against a strong alumni team
retuming for homecoming. There
should be a_ standing-room-only

The game starts at 11 am. on
Saturday.

Coach Kachmarick will lead

ships at Princeton next weekend. If

out the clock at the end of the
game, though. In fact, it could not
even hold on to the ball.

On the third play, after a
Princeton timeout, Hatajik was
flushed from the pocket and he
threw an interception, which was
returned ten yards to the Bucknell
14-yard line.

Maranzana said on his deci-
sion to throw the ball with time
running down in the game, “If I had
to do it again I wouldn't have

thrown it. We have thrown out of
the endzone and have safe possibili-
ties from there. These plays have
made the difference on third downs
in the past. If I had it again I would
have ran the ball and punted."

On the next play, Princeton
scored a touchdown, even though
the pass deflected off a Bucknell
defender's hands. The touchdown
made the score 14-9 with 1:21 left
to play. Princeton went for the two-
point conversion but came up
empty.

had an open net in front of the

the play by a Ram player. The
result was a Bucknell penalty kick
to be taken by the Bison’s Icading
scorer, Gulick. The senior slipped
on his approach to the ball, but still
managed to beat Fordham’s Dan
Callahan to the left commer, account-
ing for his ninth goal of the season
and a Bucknell 2-1 victory

With the win, and a same day

Bucknell clinched a playoff spot in
the Patriot League Championships
and wound up as the #1 seed. Col-
gate is also guaranteed a berth, and
th m ng two seeds will be

The Bison have three games

Goaltenders Racek and Wri-

Racek and Wrigley could
very well be the key when the con-
ference championships are held. If
the two can maintain the concentra-
tion levels and performances that
they’ve had all season, the Bison
should be in good shape, as they
make a run for their first Patriot
League title.

Women’s tennis finishes at 11-2

By Kymm Carlson and
Christopher Mosunic
Staff Writer

The women's tennis squad
finished off their season with the
official record of 11 wins and two
losses. Confident in their ability,
the women entered the Patriot
League championships at Lehigh on
October 13-14, The Lady Bison fin-
ished third defeating Army and
Lafayette but were nudged out by
Lehigh and champion Fordham.

In the first round, the team had a
difficult time with Mary Ann
Benack, Steph Ryer and Liz Mur-
phy falling to Fordham's top seeds.
First-seed Karen Stagliano and sec-
ond-seed Kymm Carlson both had
byes.

The only Bucknell win came
from Jennifer Wyckoff °92 who
defeated her Holy Cross Opponent
with ease 6-1, 6-2. The only Buck-
nell first-round doubles match was
captured by the team of Stagliano-
Benack versus Army 6-0, 6-1.

The second-round was full of
excitement as Carlson was strug-
gled against Fordham leading to a
Bucknell loss. Stagliano took her
Lehigh opponent for a Bucknell
victory 6-1, 3-6, 6-1.

Wyckoff evened her record at
1-1 following a loss to Lehigh. In
doubles action the team of Stagli-
ano and Benack was put down by a
strong Fordham squad. Carlson and
Thompson combined to beat Lafay-
ette 7-6, 6-2 and Ryer and Wyckoff
were defeated by the Fordham

team. The final round featured two
Bucknell wins. Stagliano defeated
her Fordham opponent in a third
singles match and the team of Carl-
son/ Thompson beat out Army in
the second doubles match. This
doubles win avenged their prior
loss to Army during the season.

Coach Rose Ewan com-
mented, “I feel that we played
some good tough tennis this past
season. I am extremely pleased
with the level of play the squad had
this year.”

Cross-country tunes up for Patriot
League Championships tomorrow

By Jennifer Walsh
Staff Writer

Led by the strong running of
Matt Deardorff ‘92, the Bucknell’s
men’s cross-country team came
away with a stunning fifth-place
finish in the pre-NCAA meet on
October 15 in Knoxville,
Tennessee.

The Bison men’s team
defeated the University of Ala-
bama, the eleventh-ranked team in
the nation, while finishing behind
only four other teams, three of
which are also ranked in the
nation’s top twenty.

Bucknell looks to extend its

good fortunes tomorrow, as they
try to capture the inaugural Patriot
League Championships.

Deardorff placed fifteenth in
the overall standings, and credited
Bucknell’s remarkable effort to a
good training schedule.

“Things are starting to come
together for us now,” said Dear-
dorff. “The training gets a little dif-
ferent now, the workouts are
quicker than they were in the
beginning of the season, so our
legs aren’t quite as dead for racing.
And we ran pretty tough, according
to the coach.”

After this excellent meet, the
Bucknell men will go on to race in

the Patriot League Championships,
a race that could be difficult.

“Tt depends on who’s there,”
notes Deardorff. “Army is pretty
good, but besides Army, there
aren’t any really strong teams.”

Other finishers for Bucknell
at pre-NCAA’s were Bob Kelly
“92, Todd Vincent ‘92, Jeff Loomis
“92, Matt Loeffler ‘92, Norbert
Berenyi ‘91, and Jason Cahilly ‘92,
who placed 27th, 34th, 37th, 44th,
45th, and SOth, respectively.

The women’s cross-country
team did not race in the past two
weeks.

The Lady Bison will also run
at the Patriot League Champion-

Bison top Delaware fo raise record to 1 1-3-1]

By Chad Bown
Staff Writer

In a similar manner that
many great football teams have two
x and competent quarterbacks,
Bucknell men’s soccer team

has been led all season by the
strong play of its two field gener-
als, goaltenders Scott Racck ‘91
and Mark Wrigley ‘94. The platoon
system instituted by Coach Craig
Reynolds has been a major reason
why the Bison now find themselves

Tri-captain Kirk Lorie ‘91 is a large reason why the Bison defense has
been so difficult to score upon this season.

in first place in the Patriot League.
Bucknell’s record currently stands
at 10-3-1.

Bucknell traveled to Easton
on October 13 for a key game
against rival Lafayette. The field
conditions were poor, but the play
was evenly matched throughout the
contest. The Bison had their best
opportunity to score in the first
half, but Lafayette goalie Peter
Lugar made an outstanding save on
a Ken Gulick ‘91 one-timer. Buck-
nell keeper Scott Racek ‘91 also
played a solid first half for the
Bison, keeping the game close. The
second half looked bleak for Buck-
nell when Lafayette’s Timo Pape
stuck in a rebound against goalie
Mark Wrigley ‘94 just ten minutes
into the second half, putting the
Bison in a 1-0 hole.

Bucknell came back though,
and at 24:20 reserve Jeff Capone
‘94 lifted the Bison with his first
goal of the season to tie the score
At the end of regulation, the score
remained 1-1, and the two teams
played a scoreless overtime period
to end the contest in a deadlock

“T was real pleased with our
performance,” said Coach
Reynolds. “I used the bench a lot
more than I have in previous
games, and the intensity of the
Starters and reserves was real good
Capone, Bill Connors ‘93, and Bo
Fifer ‘94 performed well filling in
to give Our starters a well needed
rest. It would have been sweet to
win it, but it’s better than a disap-
pointing loss.”

The team then traveled Octo-
ber 17 to play a struggling Ship-
pensburg squad. Both teams played

Bucknell football’s __five-
game win streak was snapped last
Saturday when the Bison allowed a
10-0 first quarter lead to slip away,
as William & Mary
straight points in their 45-17 vic-
tory. The Tribe, ranked 14th in
Division I-AA, had too strong of
an offense for Bucknell, gaining
562 yards on the day and averag
ing over seven yards for each play.

The game started out well
for the Bison, as they took the
opening kickoff and drove 64
yards before Todd Krutchkoff '91
nailed a 41 yard field goal. The
drive was sparked by a 26-yard
scamper up the middle by Brian
Henesey '92. The run put him in
ifth place on Bucknell's all-time
rushing list
After William & Mary
missed a field goal, Bucknell got
the ball back on its own 22-yard
ine. The Bison marched to the
Tribe goalline in ten plays, culmi-
nating with a 19-yard touchdown
pass from Todd Hatajik '91 to

That touchdown turned the

drove 73 yards in just under five
minutes to jump ahead 14-10 a
lead it wouldn't relinquish. The
drive was dominated by the Wil-

accounted for 64 of the 73 yards
on the drive.

Jeff Kelly '92. He completed all

record set by Steve Barimo in
1988.

The previous week Bucknell
defeated Princeton 14-9, in a game
led by the defense. The main spark
was provided by John Spatafore
‘92, who was named the Patriot
League Defensive Player of the
Week. He was credited with 19
tackles, including 12 unassisted and
asack. He also intercepted his sec-
ond pass of the year and returned it
32 yards to set up the Bison's sec-
ond touchdown.

than enough to get his team going
in the right direction. The Bison
took advantage of the Shippensburg
defense with seven unanswered
goals to propel them to the 8-1 vic-
tory. Alex Kogan ‘94 had a hat
trick and Gulick, Jon Mackenzie
“93, Ryan Bucceri ‘94, and Scott
Tardibuono ‘93 each added single
scores.

“The second half took a little
of the air out of their balloon,”
stated Reynolds. “It was good to
have a second half where we
weren’t shaky. I’m glad that some
of the reserves were able to come
in and maintain and even add to our
lead.”

Bucknell hosted the Fordham
Rams last Saturday in another cru-
cial Patriot League contest.
Reynolds had said earlier in the
season that “Fordham had the best
personnel of anyone in the league,
and if they played their best ball
game, they’d be tough to beat.”

The game was tightly played

On the next play, Hatajik connected
with Walsh for 16 yards. A few
plays later Hatajik kept the ball and
ran seventeen yards down the right
sideline before going out of bounds
at the three. Three plays later Cav-
lovic punched the ball in from the
one yard line to give the Bison a 7-
0 lead.

Bucknell had one more crack
at scoring, as they began another
drive with 4:23 left on the clock.
Hatajik completed a 14-yard pass
to Marc Harrison '91 following a
20-yard strike to Erb. But Hatajik
was intercepted, as he attempted to
convert a fourth down from Prince-
ton's 27-yard line with :25 left in
the half.

Coach Lou Maranzana com-
mented on his decision to go for the
first down in lieu of the 44-yard
field goal. "First, given the condi-
tions, it was a real tough field goal.
We figured it was on the outer lim-

its of Todd's range. We thought we

had a chance to make the first
down and the field position we had
was not too bad with the way the
defense had been playing. Three
points -was a low
possibility."

The third
quarter continued
with more great

Bucknell then held

Hamilton got the
call and swept
right, but was una-
ble to score as he was stopped by
Kevin Kane ‘93. Kane ended the
game with 13 tackles.

Bucknell's offense got into
the act after it received a spark
from the defense. Spatafore picked
off a Joel Sharp pass and retumed it
to Princeton's 28-yard line. Three
plays later, on third-and-eight, Hat-
ajik threw to Erb as the wide
Teceiver broke past the cornerback
on a slant pattern over the middle
of the field. The play totalled 26
yards and put the Bison up by four-
teen points.

Princeton took the kickoff
and drove 60 yards on 10 plays cul-
minating with a 30-yard field goal
by Chris Lutz. The key play on the
drive was a 19-yard run up the mid-
dle by Chris Hallihan. For the
game, Hallihan had 113 yards on
16 carries. Princeton ran for a total
of 190 yards against the Bison.

State police retreat from the front lines of the disturbance as part of an agreement to have students move

back on to campus.

Administration reacts

By David Murray
Staff Writer

Reflecting back upon
Wednesday night’s near-riot on 7th
Street, President Gary Sojka and
Dean of Students John Dunlop both
agree that students were lucky in
the way the disturbance was han-
died by police. They also appre-
ciate students’ sincerety and com-
mitment to productive change, and
hope many constructive sugges-
tions will flow from Wednesday’s
unrest

“Students never knew they
jeopardy,” commented
Dunlop. “They never knew the
potential” for danger. “The thing
I’m still most grateful for,” added
Sojka, “is  that...nobody got
whacked on the head with a club,
nobody got attacked by a dog,
nobody got blasted with a water
cannon, nobody got arrested, no
policeman ended up in the emer-
gency room with cuts and abra-
sions, and there was no significant
property damage.”

Thinking back to the stand-
off with police, Sojka said “I was
certainly impressed with a number
of what I would call ‘Student Lead-

were in

ers’ and I don’t mean necessarily
people holding elected posts in stu-
dent government, but people who
took it upon themselves to rise to
the front in a tense situation to put
themselves in, if not in physical
jeopardy, in jeopardy of ridicule
from their colleagues, and they
were willing to take that chance to
do what they thought was the right
thing. There were a fair number of
such people, and that’s gratifying.”

Dunlop assessed __ student
opinion after the demonstration:
“Everyone feels good today
because they finally, from their
point of view, had a say... They
thought for once their administra-
tion listened long and hard and |
think we [in the administration}
feel good too because we really
tried” to address student concerns.

Looking ahead, however, the
President warned that “a very criti-
cal period lics ahead of us this
weekend. Obviously,” Sojka said,
“security is still going to be here.
We still have Act 31. We still have
obligations to do due diligence in
enforcing Act 31.”

Sojka continued “Hopefully
the students will note that security
is trying to be very sensitive in the

Jimmy Carter speaks
at Weis Center

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

“This is a very good time for
me emotionally, I’ve been very
busy,” said former President James
Earl Carter. Carter spoke at a pri-
vate party for the Geisinger Foun-
dation which honored former Penn-
sylvania Governor William
Scranton and former Pennsylvania
health services director Leonard
Bachman Wednesday night at the
Weis Center. The Geisinger Foun-
dation rented out the Weis Center
for this private function.

Carter appreciated the fact
that there were no reporters there
becuase while in office he “was fol-
lowed around by 1200 ... inquisitive
reporters in the White House press
room.”

Carter discussed humanitar-
ian concerns in medicine as well as
the crisis in the Persian Gulf.

In addressing the many physi-
cians at the dinner Carter stressed
the importance of the “prevention
of disease, [since] 65% of all of the
premature deaths can be prevented
by our own personal habits.” He
explained that “when we organized
that Carter Center in Atlanta Geor-
gia I chose as director, Dr. William
Fahey [the man who eradicated
smallpox].”

He described the humanitar-
ian purpose of the Carter Center
and related one of its projects to the

audience. “We were asked to come
to China in 1987 ... We were asked
to add an unprecedented element to
the life of the Chinese, care for the
handicapped.” He told the audi-
ence that Deng Xao Ping’s son had
fallen from a third story window,
and that the Chinese infrastructure
was not equipped to accomodate
handicapped people. The Carter
Center therefore “trained 93 spe-
cialists to work with [the Chinese]
people” and to train other
specialists.

In discussing the world situa-
tion, Carter presented both general
and specific views. On the general
level Carter explained that there is
a “university in Switzerland moni-
toring major world conflicts. [But]
not a single one of them was
between two countries. Every one
of them was a civil war.” He
explained that world protocol pre-
cludes “the U.N. ... from dealing
with this.” It is this “horrible vac-
cum in the world that the Carter
Center is trying to address,” said
Carter.

Carter eased in to the Gulf
Crisis by explaining that during his
“administration the greatest threat
of World War III] was in Europe,
{but] now the Middle East may
be.”

He espoused three general
guidelines that the U.S. should use

the officers told the crowd to dis-
perse another student, Scott Macfee
92, asked if he could take Yount’s
photograph. According to Yount, “I
told him to disperse, and he stuck
around. I told him again to dis-
perse, and he took the picture and
ran.” Yount caught Macfee, who
was detained in a police car and
later released.

Macfee said, “I took his pic-
ture and he chased me. He threw
me against a wall, [then threw me
in the back of a car for 45 min-
utes.” Macfee quoted Yount as say-
ing, “Why did you take my picture,
I told you not to,” when he was
detained. Yount explained that
snapping the photo was not against
the law, but “the situation was I
told him to disperse. Everyone
wants to see how far he wants to
go, and at that point I was commit-
ted to stop him.” Yount said that
the crowd, which was dispersing,
began to return to the backyard to
watch Macfee. Macfee claimed
Wednesday night that Yount had
and that he
planned to press charges. In a fur-
ther interview Thursday, Macfee
said, “I saw I had no place to run,
so I turned to face him [Yount]. He
put me up against the wall and

would not comment on Macfee’s

prety

accusations, other than to say that
the description “was entirely his
own opinion.”

According to several other
students present, the treatment and
detention of Macfee sparked the
demonstration by encouraging stu-
dents to remain until Macfee was
released. Garrett Austin °94 said, “I
was at the party. The cops started
swarming in. (According to Lewis-
burg Chief Donald Heiter, only two
officers responded initially.) We
moved out into the street, [and] a
student took a picture of a cop.”
After Macfee’s detention, “We sat
down in the street and started
chanting ‘Give Peace a Chance.’
More people heard us and more
people came.” When asked if he
felt the incident with Macfee
sparked the disturbance, Yount
said, “I disagree with that. Over
100 people had already moved out
front.”

Although Dunlop and Yount
said that only Macfee was detained,
another student, Keith Mann °93
was also detained by East Buffalo
Township Police, and was also
released. Chief Robert Gramley
said that at least two students had
been detained and that “we
detained one person for Lewis-
burg;” the confusion in official
accounts seems to be because Mac-

Discussion began at the Langone center with President Sojka and John Dunlop, dean of students after the
crowd left Seventh Street. Concerns were voiced in an open forum format.

Gerry Commerford, assistant dean
of residential life, all walked from
the LC to the gathering on the
quad. Once the portable amplifica-
tion system was set up again next
to the library door, the administra-
tors resumed their dialogue with
students.

DeCerchio began by answer-

in order to resolve the conflict. “1)
Do not duplicate what others are
doing; 2) act in a non-partisan or
bi-partisan manner; and 3) main-
tain an academic environment, that
is [do not conduct studies merely
to have reports, but analyze to
facillitate proper action].”

According to Carter, there
are several reasons for the initial
conflict between Iraq and Kuwait.
“Since the British left ... [Iraq has
been] a landlocked country”
although they have a_ historical
claim to access to the Persian Gulf.
“Another problem was that the Ira-
qis claim they protected
Kuwait from an Iranian invasion.”
Kuwait also loaned $12 billion to
Iraq during the war and demanded
repayment afterwards. The “Iraqis
claim that the Kuwaitis drilled into
Iraq during the war.” The Iraqis
claim that Kuwait “exceeded the
OPEC quoted by a million barrels
a day.”

The signs were obvious but
the rest of the world avoided them,
according to Carter. “They tried to
Negotiate to resolve these prob-
lems. Saddam said he was going to
invade Kuwait and nobody
believed him.”

After the invasion, according
to Carter, the “U.S. and all the
other countries in the Westen
World rose up in anger and
demanded total withdrawal.”

Carter agrees with sanctions
to an extent. “The most effective
thing to do is punish [them with
sanctions}. We have to cut off sup-
plies of crucial materials to Iraq. I
don’t know of any alternative to
these economic sanctions.” But,
Carter disagrees with the total
embargo against Iraq. He charac-

terized it as “trying to force a dicta-
tor out of office by [crushing] his
people.” According to Carter, Huss-
ein was not “going without his
Cornflakes.”

“The other option is military
action,” according to Carter. “This
is increasingly being urged over
others [including] President
Bush.” Carter offered several rea-
SONS not to go to war.

The Carter Center calls
“twelve experts to analyze the inva-
sion of Iraq,” and among them was
Admiral William Crowe, former
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. According to Carter, “He
[Crowe] pointed out that there is a
trusim in military strategy. [It
takes] three times the force to
invade than to invade .... that makes
it extraordinarily difficult [difficult]
for an invading force to overcome
you’re — entrenched [position].”
Carter cited this truism as the rea-
son that Iraq did not defeat Iran
because both countries kept going
into the other

Carter also explained that
Moslems “take over the role of a
martyr” to defend their country
against “Western infidels.” ;

Economically, Carter warned
that the Iraqis are “capable of carry-
ing out Saddam Hussein’s threat [to
destroy oil rigs in Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia using sophisticated
artillery].”

In terms of the human cost,
Carter estimated that war with Iraq
would cost 10,000 to 30,000 Amer-
ican lives “and that
include women and
Kuwait City.”

Carter finally described the
international problems that would
arise if the U.S. went to war with-
out the U.N. support. “Even if we
are inclined to go to war with Iraq,
if we were to do so without the sup-
port of the U.N. Security Council it
would be very bad politicallly.
President Gorbachev has made it
plain [they would not go to war
unless] under the U.N. flag.”

Carter also discussed the role
of Israel in the Middle East in rela-
tion to Egypt and the Palestinians.
He contended that the Israeli/
Egyptian peace treaty that he
orchestrated “has been meticu-
lously Israel and
Egypt.” He also said that as a pri-
vate citizen his perspective on
Israel has changed. “Now I go and I
can stay fifteen days or so.” On his
trips Carter has visited the West
Bank and Gaza

DeCerchio addresses Panhel

By Brian Hutchinson

Only hours before 900 stu-
dents and 200 police officers con-
fronted one another on seventh
street, Vincent DeCerchio, Buck-
nell’s new security director, met
with the Panhellenic Council.
Hosted by Dean Dunlop, the pur-
pose of this meeting was to address
specific security issues and to dis-
cuss DeCerchio’s intentions con-
cerning the more pressing problems
of the current system.

DeCerchio is a strong advo-
cate of students themselves becom-
ing a vital ingredient in implement-
ing the new policy-development
process. DeCerchio began, “I
believe in students rights. I am a
strong believer in participatory
management.” Under his director-
ship, students would accept his
challenge by taking full advantage
of his “open door policy”. “This
team-approach is the single most
important contribution to good rela-
tions—its absence being the single
most deficit to bad relations.” Evi-
dently to DeCerchio, the lack of
such an approach has been most
instrumental in fostering the current
student sentiment toward the nature
of Bucknell Security’s behavior.

DeCerchio addressed this pre-
vailing sentiment which he feels is
embodied by the recently submitted
petition which now has over 1000
student signatures. “The petition
discussed seven or eight conditions,

point-by-point, professionally and
objectively, and its points are well
taken.” DeCerchio promises that he
will begin his prompt response
through policy implementation that
will include the following: an accu-
rate reporting of student violations,
the insurance that reports will be
made promptly available to the par-
ties involved, and a clear definition
of security procedures.

A member raised the question
of whether or not a charge brought
against a student and its proceed-
ings should be accompanied by a
time limit. Another member
expressed the importance of pre-
venting charges of students from
being “left over” for weeks at a
time—something which, in the
recent past, had occurred much to
the utter frustration of those people
involved. DeCerchio responded,
“We are thinking along the lines of
a charge sheet listing all common
violations—a check-off list with an
attached charge sheet.” With his
plan, a statute of limitation would
also be enacted. This limitation
would cause the nullification of all
charges that fail to be filed within
an established time period.

When asked how the security
officers had thus far reacted to the
forthcoming changes, DeCerchio
explained, “They’ve reacted posi-
tively. In the past, they have often
been acting on their own without
specific guidelines.” Students have
been well aware of the scope of the

latitude with which security had
recently been armored and have
been subject to the inconsistent
approaches among security offi-
cials. The measure of strictness or
“leniency” with which incidents
were handled did in no way reflect
a security officer’s feelings toward
students. According to DeCerchio,
“J do not want someone working
for me that does not like the stu-
dents. The new director is eagerly
awaiting the day when students
again can feel comfortable with
those campus employees whose
jobs are to protect the very same
people with whom there is a grow-
ing animosity. Evidently, students
have been growing increasingly
impatient awaiting this day.

DeCerchio empathizes with
the University’s position facing
state laws and their inherent liabili-
ties. His intention is to develop “a
process” that would satisfy the obli-
gations of the University as dic-
tated by these liabilities. DeCerchio
does not assert that the policies this
process ultimately would yield
must follow the letter of the law
necessarily. “We want to satisfy the
spirit of the law but in the context
of University terminology, not in
legal terminology.”

The system under DeCerchio
appears to be more sympathetic to
student demands. In the pursuit of
dismantling the current parent-child
relationship that security has with

Condom distribution assessed

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

Though condoms have
been available on campus at the
Ziegler Health Center and through
vending machines located in laun-
dry rooms since 1988, Morgan
Woods ‘93 believes that most stu-
dents may not know that they are
available at all. Responding to this
perceived ignorance or disfavor of
the manner in which the University
makes condoms available to stu-
dents, Woods and a collection of
students and administrators have
commited themselves to gathering
student input in an effort to create a
scheme of distribution that will cor-
respond to student needs.

Stating that Bucknell’s
mode of condom distribution was “a
little outdated since most campuses
have condom machines in dormi-
tory bathrooms and sell them in
their bookstores,” Woods wants to
explore the possibility that the Uni-
versity may need to revamp its
present mode of distribution in
order to encourage the use of con-
doms as an effective means of pre-
venting sexually transmitted
diseases.

According to Woods, who
is working through the Umbrella
Organization, early this month stu-
dents will receive a questionnaire
requesting them to state their sug-
gestions for reconsidering condom
availability. At present, Woods said,
she is not certain how the Univer-
sity should make condoms more
accessible and that her plan for peti-
tioning the administration would be
determined primarily by referring to
responses to the questionnaire.

Assistant Director of Resi-
dential Life Susan Zingale, who has
been working with Woods, said that
at this stage the project concerning
condom distribution is at an infor-
mation gathering stage. “I am
mostly interested in hearing what
students think; it’s their issue, it’s
their campus.”

In addition to the Umbrella
Organization, an organizational alli-
ance of activist groups on campus, —
Friends of Gay men and Lesbians,
and the Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual
Awareness Group- are supportive
of Woods’ efforts to explore the
possibilities of widening the availa-

bility of condoms on campus.

In response to the danger
of the spread of sexually transmit-
ted diseases, and particularly AIDS,
the University has concerned itself
with making condoms available to
students for a number of years yet
it appears that members of the
administration were originally quite
resistant to introducing condom
vending machines to the campus on
the grounds that it would be
improper.

Mark Cool ‘91, a member
of the President’s. Advisory Com-
mittee on AIDS in 1987, stated that
the committee was exceptionally
slow in moving ahead on making
condoms available on campus
because of these concerns for pro-
priety. “We sat and fought about
what alumni, parents, and prospec-
tive students would say when they
saw condom dispensers in resi-
dence hails,” Cool said.

The perspective of the stu-
dents on the committee, according
to Cool, was that the concern for
the opinion of alumni and others
did not outweigh the need to take
preventative measures against
AIDS and other sexually transmit-
ted diseases. Cool cited former
legal counsel John Zeller as the
member of the committee who was
most opposed to making condoms
available on campus; in addition,
director of the book store, Eileen
Morrow, also blocked efforts to sell
condoms in the book store.

Morrow was unable to be
contacted before this edition went
to print but Vicki Benion, assistant
director of the bookstore, stated
that at the time the bookstore was
being restricted from selling con-
doms by University policy, rather
than actually refusing to offer them
for purchase.

While unable to comment
on previous adminstrative attitudes
Zingale said, “We as administrators
need to accept that students are
having sex.” For Zingale the most
important issue is to provide stu-
dents with a means to protect them-
selves from secually transmitted
diseases (STD’s) and AIDS. “The
national situation has gotten to the
point where AIDS is pretty much
everywhere and in considering con-
dom availability we have to think
long-term and be more progressive.”

At present condoms are
available in laundry rooms located
in four dormitories—the Gateways,
Bucknell West, Swartz Hall , and
Roberts Hall. A fifth machine was
located in Vedder Hall, but it was
damaged in spring of this year and
has yet to be repaired.

According to Preston
Hoyle, director of student medical
services, 1104 condoms were dis-
tributed from these machines
between March 1989 and March
1990. Between August and Septem-
ber of this year, 232 condoms were
sold. In Hoyle’s estimation, consid-
ering that these numbers represent
the distribution from four or five
machines across the campus, stu-
dent usage is infrequent.

Hoyle also commented that
though brochures educating people
concerning STDs and safe sexual
practises are meant to be available
with the condoms, they are seldom
found in the racks that are attached
to the vending machines. ‘“Con-
doms alone are not going to solve
the AIDS problem without educa-
tion and people changing their sex-
ual behavior,” Hoyle said.

Since 1986 the University
has supported a handful of commit-
tees that addressed the issues of
AIDS and AIDS prevention. A Uni-
versity Committee on AIDS com-
posed of administrators was orga-
nized in 1986 to develop a
procedural guideline to be in
accord with the guidelines of the
American College Health Associa-
tion concerning AIDS. Further-
more, there has been the AIDS
Task Force composed of students
and administrators and a collection
of students who act as Peer Educa-
tors on the issue of AIDS and the
transmission on the virus.

Safe sex kits that contain
condoms, spermicidial foam, and
educational brochures have also
been available through Student
Health Services since 1987. But
Students have not had much
recourse to these either; during the
1989-90 academic year sixty five
kits were distributed by the Health
Center and fourteen so far this year.

“T am sure that the major-
ity of the campus is not aware that
the kits are available,” Hoyle stated
suggesting that there was a need to

University considering plans for
retirement complex near campus

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

In an attempt to limit tuition
cost increases, Bucknell is consid-
ering building a retirement village
on a 26-acre tract of land between
the athletic fields and the golf
course. A committee headed by
Russell Ernest, graduate of the
class of 1942, is investigating the
feasibility of opening the retire-
ment complex which would supply
the university with non-tuition
revenue.

The primary reason for such
an investigation, is to “see if it’s
feasible ‘to have a return on that

, Teal estate asset that’s greater than
what we’re earning on it not in
renting it out to a local farmer,”
said Barry Maxwell, vice president
for administration.

“We're continually —con-
cemed with the _ escalating
increases in tuition and one of
objectives is to examine very
closely all non-tuition sources of
revenue with the intent of trying to
hold our tuition increases to a mini-
mum,” Maxwell said.

The retirement village would
be for alumni, retired staff, and
friends of the university. “We see
particularly great benefits for hav-
ing retired Bucknell alumni and
friends of the university in close
proximity of the university to be
able to work and interact with
faculty and staff in productive
kinds of ways,” said Maxwell.

Members of the general com-
munity would not be permitted into
the village unless they were con-
nected in some way to the univer-
sity. “We would not open it to the
general public ... we would want it
to be Bucknell related,” said
Maxwell.

Emest, project coordinator,
has been conducting phone inter-
views of 50 retired alumni from the
classes of 1936-61 who, in

response to a questionnaire, expres-
sed interest in entering such a com-
munity within the next two to five
years. By conducting telephone
interviews, Emest intends to find
out exactly how many individuals
are willing to see the project move
forward.

The project is still in plan-
ning stages. Emest’s committee
will present its proposal at the Nov.
16 meeting of the board of trustees.
In the meantime, the committee is
considering whether enough indi-
viduals will be willing to put their
homes up for sale in a time when
the real estate market is not strong.

“T’ve talked to about 34 of
{the alumni] and there is interest.
The main concem that people have
is their ability to sell their existing
home and take their equity in that
home and come here and pay for a
unit here in retirement,” said
Emest.

Eight years ago the university
conducted a similar study, also
headed by Ernest. For that project,
an architect drew up a plan for the
retirement village before the com-
mittee decided to postpone further
planning due to the poor real estate
market. The current project has not
reached the stage in which an archi-
tect would be consulted.

A core group of about 15
retirees would be necessary for
starting the project. “To insure
interest we'd have to ask for a
deposit,” said Emest. The deposit
would likely be approximately
$2000 to $3000. Deposits would be
placed in an escrow account.

“Then when it came to build-
ing [the village] they would have to
put up a fair amount because the
first payments to build it would be
due,” said Emest.

According to Emest, the
committee would like the project to
be self-financing so that no univer-
sity funds would be necessary in
initiating construction. Money retir-

ees pay for units would be used to
finance construction.

Although the complex, when
complete, would include just over
100 living units, only groups of
about 15 would be built at a time.
Units for the core group of 15 retir-
ees will, if the project continues, be
complete in two to three years.

Retirees who decide to move
into the retirement village will
have a choice of several different
types of units. Emest
explained that the committee is
considering three types of housing:
apartments, clustered units, and
semi-detached units.

According to

housing

Emest, the
apartment house might be built to
look like a barn “to keep the archi-
tecture rural looking, and because
it would be right next to the art
barn.” In addition, he said, building
it into a hill would allow easy
access to different floors without
forcing elderly individuals to climb
stairs.

Rather than town houses,
which also have stairs, one-story
clustered units would be an option
for retirees. “A lot of older people
don’t like steps, so townhouses
probably wouldn’t be too popular,”
said Emest.

Prices for an apartment might
range from $50-70,000, and, $140-
150,000 for a larger unit, according
to Maxwell. However, because the
project is still in the early planning
Stages, the committee has con-
ducted no sophisticated cost
analyses.

“What we’re trying to gauge
is whether there’s an interest and
whether that interest is at all
impacted by the range that we
would price the units at,” said
Maxwell.

If not enough people commit
to the project, the committee will
recommend to the trustees that the
project be put on hold a little
longer.

{and] I was saying ‘just sit down,
join in, sing.’” As he was walking
around the group, Mann said, he got
his arms “pinned behind by four
cops. They told me I was being
arrested for instigating a riot. They
cuffed me and threw me in the back
of a car for an hour.” He said of
Dunlop: “I think he had a pretty big
part in getting me out.” Finally,
Mann said he was told that “if I get
out and try to disperse the crowd,
they'd let me go, otherwise they'd
keep me.” He addressed the crowd
over the loudspeaker for about five
minutes “with security holding me
on both sides. After it wasn’t work-
ing, they made me leave the scene.”

said the water pressure would not
have been sufficient to injure peo-
ple, but only to “get them wet and
slipt and sliding around. It gives
us a chance to snap them up.”

tal in securing his release.

In addition, the State Police
in Milton had “approximately 80
people available, [although] not all
were on-site,” according to Corpo-
ral Max Beaver of the Milton Bar-
racks. Some of the troopers were
wailing in a Staging area estab-
lished at the Plaza 15. He said that,
according to standard procedure, all
troopers were dressed in full riot
gear,

The United States pentientary
in Lewisburg also responded with
three buses and 40 staff members,
inch z a SWAT team, according
to Public Affairs Officer Donald
Emery. He said that the institution
‘responded at the request of Union
County...at approximately 11:45

etenuon of students.

ion soon moved
into a standoff, as more students
congregated in the area, with about

100 students perched on the roofs of
front porches on the block. Sojka
was soon joined on the scene by
Dunlop, Charlotte Weddle, asso-
ciate vice president for Student
Life, Gerry Comerford, assistant
dean of Residential Life, and Vince
DeCerchio, director of Security and
Safety. The administrators moved
through the crowd, and a number of
students, administrators and towns-
people addressed the crowd on a
loudspeaker, encouraging the crowd
to move onto campus. Bill Ocker
*57, a resident of Market Street, told

everyone would have been

arrested.” He said, “If we had to ,

move we could have done it....The
idea is to get them to disperse.
They didn’t have respect [for us] at
that particular time, and if they
don’t disperse, there’s going to be a
lot of sorry people.” He went on to
say, “Respect is a two-way
street... They can’t even police their
own friends. They’ve got to respect
the law in this community.”

There were some on the
scene who questioned the degree of
mobilization by the police. When
asked about the presence of the
canaine units, Comerford said, “I’m
not in charge of the local police,
but I don’t think it’s right.” When
interviewed at 2:30 a.m., and again
Thursday afternoon, Heiter vigor-
ously defended the level of
repsonse, saying, “It’s better to
have all you need, it could have
been a lot worse....I think everyone
did a fine job in cooperating and
trying to work with [the students].”
Heiter wanted to make sure he had
adequete force available to control
any consequence which might arise

cause “I do not want to be

responsible for any fatalities from §
drug overdose, alcohol overdose or ;

criminal activity.”

Among the administrators on
the scene, Weddle said, “They’re
breaking the law. [Heiter] issued an

November 2, 1990

order and the responsibility is on
the students....The risk of danger
and harm is so great.” DeCerchio
felt “the students have a valid
point, but I believe they're punish-
ing the community in the process.”

the crowd, “We had fun, too, but we
knew when to quit. That time is
now. We don’t want any damn riot
around here.”

Police also made an effort to
usher students onto the sidewalks
Members of the East Buffalo Police
Department were brandishing “stun
guns” at students while telling them
to move. One officer held the
device within two inches of a stu-
dent and discharged the device
Gramley said that “in order for it to
stun anyone, he has to touch some-
one, [but] you could scare someone
by clicking it a few times.”

By around 11:30, Sojka had
agreed to address students at the
downhill entrance to the Langone
Center, and Heiter said no one
would be arrested if they moved up
to the LC. At approxmiately 12:15,
Dunlop summed up the situation
“We're trying to get them up there,
but they don’t want to go.”

Shortly after midnight, Heiter
began moving his car slowly down
the street, behind several officers,
Comerford, Dunlop and Weddle
When the car, moving south, came
abreast of 220 South Seventh,
Heiter’s car was hit first by an egg
and then by two bottles, causing
minor damage. Heiter said today,
“All I needed was one more inci-
dent, and that would have been ‘al!

Students react to demonstration

Compiled by Tommy Abel
and Brian Hutchinson

David Skena ‘92 BSG President - “First of all, I was not there.
My first reaction was disbelief. The way in which it happened was
obviously not premeditated in any way. It was just an accident waiting
to happen; morale’s been low all semester. It’s just the latest manifesta-
tion of student frustration caused by Act 31 and the policies that
evolved from it. In the end result, I think it’s going to be constructive.
When you distill it down to what really happened, when you got up this
morning, no buildings were burning, no windows were broken, nobody
got hurt, nobody got arrested and afterwards the academic quad was
cleaned by students.”

Samantha Gladdish ‘91 Panhellenic Council President - “It
was primarily a product of some-
thing that has for some time been
internalized. It had a lot to do
with too many rules, restrictions,
sanctions. Alcohol is a part of the
issue, but a bigger part is that stu-
dents basically feel like they can’t
do what they really want to do. I
feel that our student body is basi-
cally conservative, and for a gath-
ering of this scale to take place
shows not only a sign of unifica-
tion but also that there are real
problems needing real attention.”

Mike Dominguez ‘91 IFC
President - “The event which
occurred was an opportunity for
the students to vent their anger
and frustration over incidents and
policies which have been occur-
ring for the past several years. It
was unfortunate that the student
gathering occurred in town on a
weeknight, but it was not a
planned or premeditated event.

Although this event may
have appeared to be solely cen-
tered around alcohol and under-
age drinking, I believe that the
problems of student rights and an
equitable policy are the larger
issues. The media coverage por-

it, they were just pretty mad. President Sojka is going to have to make
some sort of decision that will please everybody.”

Ed Coady ‘91 - “First of all, I was really surprised. I didn’t think
the students could shake off their usual apathy. Other than that, I have
kind of mixed feelings because the university got a signal but at the
same time a lot of people from town were understandably pissed off by

the whole thing.”

Chris Bender ‘93 - “I think it’s one of the best things that’s ever
happened since I’ve been here. It’s the first time this campus acted as a
community, and even though it was chaotic, there was honest communi-
cation between the students and administration. It’s important not to be
blinded by the fact that alcohol was involved because the real issue was
students desiring responsibility for themselves. The reason that all this

occurred is because of the break-
down of communication on cam-
pus. This was the first time I’ve
ever been proud of this school.”

Susan Smith ‘93 - “I think
it places President Sojka between
a rock and a hard place. He’s
going to have to intervene on the
side of the students and move
things back to campus and just tell
the police he’ll take care of it. We
should have had a Halloween
party in the academic quad or on
the football field.”

Ed Harhaj ’92 - “It is abso-
lutely essential that the administra-
tion view this show of dissent in
the proper light. The news por-

/ trayed it as a bunch of drunks who
» were mad because they weren't
E allowed to drink. That grossly triv-
ializes the problem. We are upset
because we are treated like chil-
e dren. We do not have the power to
affect our own destiny. The
administration decides everything
for us: whom we may associate
with, how old they must be, and
they even have the gaul to try to

ries or vandalism resulted.

I hope that the efforts by the administration previous to and after
this occurrence will help to reduce student tensions and improve the
state of morale at the university. The students of Bucknell should real-
ize that the administration and President Sojka in particular are working
very hard to address and alleviate student concerns.”

Tom Salus ‘91 Delta Upsilon President - “It was unfortunate
that ‘the student gathering’ occurred on the streets of Lewisburg and
not on campus. I do not necessarily agree with this style of protest but I
do think that it will have some positive effects. The administration of
the university has its “backs against the wall.” It is imperative that they
create alternatives for a better social life on campus, immediately, or
another gathering may occur. The problem of a declining social life at
Bucknell had been known for quite some time, but now it must be
solved. However, students should acknowledge that the administration
has been working to improve university policies during this semester.”

J.A. Shimer ‘93 - “Students obviously vented a lot of frustra-
tion—frustration which has been building up. I think that the Bucknell
student body has shown that it is not apathetic, that students will take
an active role in determining the course of their lives. I think this says a
lot of positive things about the Bucknell students.”

Jeff Chaiken ‘93 - “TI think that this was inevitable with the Uni
versity dragging its heels over the social issues. I hope that the violent
aspect of this isn’t going to overshadow the real reasons behind it, so
that it will actually benefit the campus.”

Mike Post ‘94 - “It was pretty wild! I think that the police action
was too much. The students weren’t going to make anything big out of

all of those things that affect our
lives. Students are supposed to grow in college; here the administration
ZTOWS US.

Julie Mundorf ‘94 - “It was crazy! They had dogs, and tear gas,
and water cannons. I don’t think that the students were out of line. It
was a good way for the students’ opinions to be heard. Obviously, Sojka
has to do something.”

Kara Cook ‘93 - “I thought that last night was great! It was long
overdue. Last night’s protest was simply representative of the frustra-
tions of the student body concerning the university’s enforcement of its
alcohol policy. Even if there was not alcohol present, they still would
have broken it up. Masses of us gathering just drives them crazy. If we
could gather like we did on Saturday afternoon or Wednesday night,
there would be no motivation to leave campus.”

Debra Ragusa ‘91 - “On the whole it was a good thing, a produc-
tive action. It would have been more effective if the action hadn’t
occurred during an event involving police and potential violence. It
would be even better to see students take similar actions under more
positive circumstances.”

Eric Belcher ‘91 Sigma Chi President - “It’s good to see the
campus getting excited about a particular issue, but the whole thing
seemed a little silly to me. The fact that our country is about to go to
war makes the “drinking issue” seem relatively unimportant.”

Wendy MacFarland ‘94 - “It was good that students voiced their
opinions and were heard. In general, it was handled the way it had to be;
frustration had been mounting for some time.”

retorted. “We have joined with a

move beyond the present mode of
distribution. “We, as a University
in the name of education and pre-
ventative medicine, need to pro-
vide something more.”

It is uncertain if there will be
any organized reaction on campus
against the concept of making con-
doms more available to students.
In 1989 members of the Intervar-
sity Christian Fellowship protested
a Management 101 class that was
selling condoms as part of their
marketing project on the grounds
that such activities promoted pre-
marital sex.

In a_ telephone interview
Timothy Emmett, the current presi-
dent of Intervarsity, said that he
could not say how the organization
would respond to an effort by the
University to increase the availa-
bility of condoms on campus.
Emmett suggested that there might
not be a unified action on the part
of Intervarsity, but that the individ-
ual members would respond as
they saw fit.

Some backlash, organized or
otherwise, seems possible accord-
ing to Woods. It can be expected
that part of the campus population
will consider the expansion of con-
dom availability to be in promotion
of promiscuity and pre-marital sex.
Woods, though, is more concerned
about those who would rather
ignore the reality of sexual rela-
tions amongst students.

“Tt is the attitude that it is
Okay to have sex so long as you do
not talk about it,” Woods stated.
“But that is just the attitude that
contributed to the AIDS crisis.
Keeping things quiet does not
solve problems and I do not think
that if condoms were available on
the campus it would make any
more people decide to have sex.”

Promiscuity defines the sex-
ual behavior of a significant por-
tion of the student population
sometimes reflecting a belief that
Bucknell is a safe place to have
casual sex. Hoyle said, though, that
promiscuity still represents risky
sexual behavior.

“T believe that the risk at
Bucknell is probably a little less
than at a city college,” Hoyle
explained. “But I do not believe
that anyone that does not practice
safe sex by the mere virtue of
being at Bucknell is any less likely

to pick up the AIDS virus.”

Cool, though, stated that he
believed condom use has increased
since 1987 and that students are
more concerned about STDs and
more careful in their sexual
practises.

At present Hoyle said he has
only diagnosed one case of AIDS
during his tenure at Bucknell and
that was the engineering student
Kevin Child ‘89. Child, a hemophi-
liac who was infected with the
AIDS virus by means of a blood
transfusion, died in the summer of
1989 from complications related to
the virus.

Further, Hoyle has not diag-
nosed anyone on campus as having
the Human Immuno Deficiency
virus, that is, as being HIV positive
and a carrier of the AIDS virus.
Instead of this being a sign for opti-
mism, Hoyle said that there are
undoubtedly people who are HIV
positive on campus and the fact that
he has not diagnosed them may
mean that they are also unaware of
their condition.

While AIDS is a constant and
serious concern, there are other
STDs that are more common and
more of an immediate problem for
the student population. According
to Head Nurse Nancy Shuck, four
cases of Chlamydia, a STD which
commonly affects women and may
cause infertility, have been diag-
nosed this academic year. Chla-
mydia often does not result in any
symptoms, but sometimes is accom-
panied by the more common signs
of burning during urination and ure-
thral discharge. Hoyle said that a
condom effectively protects against
an STD such as Chlamydia.

Hussein responded to the

dent urged his forces to prepare for

The timing of the dispatch
suggested that Hussien wanted to
appear strong after Bush adminis-

Congress limits
secret budget

President Bush’s power to
spend funds on classified military
Programs faces new restrictions
included in the 1991 military
spending bill passed by Congress
last week.

The struggle between the
Bush administration and Congress
focused on the “black budget” of
more than $35 billion hidden
within the military spending bill.
The secret budget provides money
for secret weapons systems and
intelligence activities.

Congress in the past has
attached classified reports to mili-
lary appropriations saying how the
money should be spent. In the past
the Bush administration has
regarded these reports as expres-
sions of Congressional will rather
than law. According to the new bill,
Congressional restrictions are now
legally binding, and Congress can
monitor compliance through
committees.

The classified budget for
foriegn intelligence and weapons in
1989 was $36 billion, more than
the budg

ets of the departments of
Education, Labor, Transportation,
or Veterans Affairs.

How admissions attempts to
increase geographic diversity | Perspective...

Cand other fairy tales)

By David Soll
Staff Writer

According to U.S. News and
World Report, Bucknell is ranked
thisrty-sixth out of 141 Liberal Arts
universities in the country. This rat-
ing upset a lot of people on cam-
pus. One can be sure, however, that
the Admissions office is smiling.
Bucknell is now seen as a national
university, whereas a few years
back it was generally seen as a
regional institution. This change is,
to some degree, a testament to
Bucknell’s expansion beyond its
core student base of New York,
New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Though Bucknell’s efforts to
increase geographic diversity are
yielding some results, the basic
makeup of the student body has not
changed significantly over the past

few years. In addition, Bucknell is
likely to encounter increased diffi-
culty in attracting students from
outside the East Coast as the num-
ber of applications will likely
decrease due to demographic
factors.

James Stanton °51 com-
mented about Bucknell in his day,
“Almost everybody came from
New York, New Jersey, and Penn-
sylvania. As an Ohioan I was a rar-
ity.” Only 9% of the class of 1951
came from outside of the East
Coast. Things haven’t changed sig-
nificantly; two thirds of the Fresh-
man class comes from either NY,
NJ, or PA. It seems that these states
will forever constitute the core of
Bucknell’s student body if recent
figures are any indication.

Ironically enough, with all
the talk of increasing geographic

diversity here at Bucknell, the class
of ‘94 is actually less “geographi-
cally diverse” than the class of ‘92.
16% of the class of ‘92 comes from
outside the East Coast while only
12% of the current Freshman class
resides outside of the East Coast.
The class of ‘93 fares comparably
with the class of ‘94 hovering
around the 12% mark.

According to Dick Skelton,
former Director of Admissions,
these numbers shouldn’t be all that
surprising. He notes, “The effort to
increase geographic diversity at
Bucknell will take ten to twelve
years to reveal itself.” When asked
by a fellow Admissions officer how
Bucknell was able to attract 11 Cal-
ifornians this year, he responded
that Bucknell had worked the area
for years and that the gains were
just starting to reveal themselves.

In an effort to increase repre-
sentation from outside the East
Coast, an
admissions

acceptance rate for regions outside
the East Coast is higher than for
Pennsylvania. This can most likely
be attributed to Bucknell’s reputa-
tion in Pennsylvania, whereas gen-
erally only top-notch students have
heard of Bucknell outside the East
Coast. In addition, noted Skelton,
more Pennsylvania students tend to
be committed to Bucknell as their
first choice and thus remain on the
waiting list from which a great
number of students were taken this
year,

There are, however, miscon-
ceptions that must be addressed in
assessing geographic diversity at
Bucknell. Skelton commented that

As it is again that time of
the year when our campus is
graced with the presence of a
fresh batch of Bucknell prospec-
lives, this week’s column is ded-
icated to raising questions and
concerns which those new to the
university would like to ask, but
never get around to in their
orientation sessions. Actually,
that’s not the real reason at all
for this week’s column. Truth-
fully, I just feel like getting stu-
pid this time around.

out of hand.

* Whatever you do, don’t
think of the fact that we’re miss-

(Oops. Just act like I didn’t say
that).

* Does anyone other than
myself get the urge to yell,
“Work faster!” when passing by
the construction sites on
campus?

* Why is it that we cov-
ered our textbooks to keep them
in good condition when we were
in high school, and don’t in col-
lege now that we’re paying exor-
bitant prices for them with little
chance of a decent refund?
What’s that all about?

* Why do so many people

have the annoying habit of com-

committees will have a mission
statement, objectives and long-term
goals. We'll be doing work, we’ll
be moving swiftly,” promises
DeCerchio. The new director sees
his department’s role as part of the
education process. His priority is to
insure a safe place to study—an
important task of which is to relate
what he thinks is responsible
drinking.

Addressing the question of
town relations, DeCerchio
explained that because his depart-
ment has no jurisdiction in town, it
is important to establish strong dip-
lomatic relations. Little did he
know of the sequence of events that
were to take place in town that
night as DeCerchio left to insure
that he wasn’t late for Mr. Carter.
With his term here at pacific Buck-
nell not yet three weeks old, diplo-
matic relations in town are hardly
being ameliorated. Most students
feel that they are asking for nothing
that is unfair or unreasonable. If the

approach in working together with
students, his process will be facili-

Geographic diversity is increasing
over the long run, albeit very
slowly. Only 10% of the class of

Staff Writer

Have you ever gotten a pink
slip in your mailbox...and the pack-
age was for your boxmate? Or have
you ever had classes all morning
and a lab all afternoon, and you fig-
ured you’d have that important let-
ter weighed and sent during your
lunch hour...and the post office in
Marts Hall was closed? We’ve all
experienced frustration at some
point when dealing with the postal
system here at Bucknell; and while
it seems as though the system is at
times inefficient, supervisor of mail
distribution Art Moser says that
this belief is simply not true.

Moser claims that the main
issue concerning mail distribution
is speedy service. Incoming student
mail (C-mail) is separated from
regular campus mail such as faculty
mail (F-mail) and other letters at
the main downtown post office in
Lewisburg. That student mail is
then delivered downhill to the stu-
dent mailroom in the ELC, and all
other mail is delivered uphill to the
post office in Marts Hall, where the
department and faculty mailboxes
are located. The Marts Hall post
office operates as a full service post
office and provides the same ser-
vices that a regular U.S. post office
does. (The Marts office is now
open from 8:30 to 4:30 and no
longer closes during lunch hour.)

a convenience for students, and
while it’s true that stamps can only
be bought six at a time, the students
are lucky to have this service avail-
able to them. Students can also
receive their packages at the ELC,
which is evident by the telltale pink
cards. (The physical plant serves
the same purpose during the sum-
mer months when school is not in
session.)

Also located in the ELC is
the switchboard office which
receives packages delivered after
5:00 pm. Open until midnight every
night, the switchboard office also
receives other deliveries such as
flowers and then notifies students
by phone.

While Marts Hall, the ELC
mailroom, the switchboard, and the
physical plant all serve as mail

It’s been said that a Grateful
Dead concert is unlike any other
show on Earth. I assume that any-
one who’s ever been to one of their
concerts would agree.

Since the release of the
Dead’s most recent albums, /n the
Dark and Built to Last, many critics
have said the group has been con-
forming to the mainstream music of
the ‘90s. But earlier this month,
Arista released Without a Net, a
compilation of fourteen live perfor-
mances recorded between October
1989 and April 1990. Produced by
Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh,
Without a Net appeared on the
shelves at a time when the band’s
future was in serious turmoil

Historically, live Grateful
Dead albums have shown consider-
able promise in terms of song
selection, but sound quality, even
on Compact Disc, has left some-
thing to be desired. Without a Net is
no different. The First Set (the title
of the first disk) opens up with a
keyboard sounding horn rhythm in
“Feel Like a Stranger,” and the
vocal back-up by Brent Mydland
creates the free-flowing unconven-
tionality which has become the
trademark of Grateful Dead
concerts

Taking into account the time
and efforts devoted to the massive
efforts of listening to hundreds of
hours of live tape to produce an
album of — such magnitude,
“Stranger” lacks a_ balancing
lever between vocal and instrumen-
tal harmony
times hear on an average quality
bootleg, Bob Weir's vocals on the
opening track do not become audi-
ble until a few verses into the song

“Stranger” followed up by
another keyboard-influenced track,
this time being a welcomed “Mis-
sissippi Half-Step/ Uptown Toode-
loo” in which the spotlight turns to
the distinguishable vocals of lead
guitarist Jerry Garcia. What starts
off as a fast-paced (for Grateful
Dead standards) jam on the “Half-
Step” it eventually slows to the typ-
ical Garcia paced riffs in the transi-
tion and ultimately culminates in a
mellow harmonizing on “Uptown
Toodeloo.”

After a patented in-between-
song “tuning,” the band breaks into
one of the many “blucs” songs
which they perform in concert. This
time the song is in the form of a
Robert Johnson original, “Walkin’
Blues.” Bob Weir’s vocal creativity
here is only surpassed by his talent
on the slide guitar. After a quite
lengthy keyboard solo, “Walkin’
Blues” slowly fades into a muffled
crowd response and rebounds into
the Garcia-styled rhythm of
“Althea.” The emotion in Garcia’s
voice adds a story line to the chords
which almost turns the pages of
another one of the Dead’s story-
book songs.

Weir again emerges from
behind his rhythm guitar to provide
the listener with the airy sounds of
a powerful “Cassidy.” And
although it too is abbreviated, this
jam provides the listener with an

As one would some-

Grateful Dead flies Without a Net

The Grateful Dead’s new album was released following the death of the band’s keyboardist, Brent Myd-
land. The timing of the release is ironic since many of the pieces at the end of the album feature the talents

of the late Mydland.

essence of weightlessness, carried
on by what we see as one of the
Dead’s smoothest creations, that
being the sounds of Garcia’s “Bird
Song.”

Nearly thirteen minutes long,
it is here where Garcia’s magic is
first acknowledged on the album
His ability to create the sounds of a
flute through the strings of his gui-
tar, and the accompaniment of
Mydland’s action on the keyboards
allows the listener to get caught up
in the magic and diversity of what
has come to be known as the Grate-
ful Dead. At one point, this “Bird
Song” almost comes to a complete
stop, as a bird would after a long
flight in order to rest its wings, and
almost like magic it gathers its
form and rhythm once again to
emerge with the grace and tranquil-
ity of a bird in flight

Atypical of most first sets of
a Dead show, we see this first set
commence with one of the groups
oldest creations in their twenty-five
year career. The powerful lyrics of
“Let It Grow” become muffled by
the instrumental abilities of Myd-
land, thus presenting him as the
group member many people had
hoped would become a major con-
tributor to the Dead’s new sound
for the °90’s. As a conclusion, Weir
finishes off the first set with a pat-
ented “We'll be back in just a little
bit,” Ieaving the listener ready for
what proves to be a fine representa-
tion of the Grateful Dead in rare
second set form.

Highlighted with one of the
Dead’s most acclaimed perfor-

A CHANCE to Print a

mances of “Eyes of the World” and
an accompaniment by saxophonist
Branford Marsalis on their recent
stint at Nassau Coliseum, the Sec-
ond Set begins with an energy
packed rendition of their famed
“China Cat Sunflower/ I Know
You Rider” in which the vocal tal-
ents of Garcia, Weir, and Mydland
are captured with tremendous
detail. Weir’s “Looks Like Rain” is
the next song, and although the
sounds of Garcia’s guitar create the
uncanny sounds of a warm summer
rain, the vocals seem to be sup-
pressed by the band’s instrumental
unity, notably the sounds of Myd-
land’s keyboards

The smooth transition into
Garcia’s “Eyes...” with Marsalis on
sax exemplifies the diversified
character which has recently been
undertaken by the band, and not
more evident than in “Victim Or
the Crime,” one of the few Weir
contributions to last year’s release,
Built to Last, Although not as
instrumentally creative as previous
selections, strangely enough, the
vocals are much more technologi-
cally in syne with the instrumental
aspect of the music than they are on
previous Weir inclusions.

What may be the true high-
light for many fans is the group's
choice to include “Help on the
Way/ Slipknot!/ Franklin’s Tower”
in a work which was already
included three other patented
“openers” (songs which the Dead
usually perform at the beginning of
a set). And although such jams on
“Bird Song” and “Looks Like

Rain” may be great in terms of
their ability to reflect a feeling or
vision, “Help.../ Slip.../ Frank...” is
what could be seen as an all out
jam. The concept of blending three
distinctive songs into one flowing
creation is a talent magically cap-
tured throughout Without A Net.
Traditionally, no Saturday
performance is complete
without one of the true crowd
pleasers, “One More Saturday
Night.” The Grateful Dead, on pre-
vious live albums, seemed to have
had difficulty in creating the sense
of their live performances on vinyl,
but this version of their Saturday
night special may even get even the
most avid critic of the Dead tapping
his foot.

night

It is here that I feel that
Without a Net should have ended.
Producer Phil Lesh’s decision to
tack on the Mydland version of

Traffic’s “Dear Mr. Fantasy” after _

“One More Saturday Night” left a
saddened taste in my mouth. In ret-
rospect, at least prior to Mydland’s
death in July, 1990, it seems that
this album was intended to capture
the “new life” of the Grateful Dead;
one full of energy and emotion.
Therefore, a “‘...Fantasy” to end the
Second Set makes me wonder what
Lesh had in mind when choosing
the song ‘selection and placement.
dronically, though, Mydland’s
“..Fantasy” could not have been
any more practical with respect to
the relativity of Mydland’s life
story.

Marred with Distaste

By Lee Guzofski

Greetings Bucknell! I hope
you all collectively had a joyous
Halloween and received many
treats. Unfortunately, it was my
distinct bad luck to have been
“tricked” into seeing Marked for
Death, starring Steven Segal. I
don’t know, maybe a black cat
crossed my path...

Marked for Death was the
story of “retired” cop John
Hatcher (a nice MASCULINE
name) who comes home to rest,
only to discover a Jamaican
“posse” or gang is threatening his
lovely suburb with drug traffick-
ing. Hatcher is willing to look the
other way until the bad guys injure
his 13 year old niece while
attempting to gun him down.
Thus, the plot...

This movie was the poorest,
lamest, most vile, disgusting
excuse for entertainment I think
I’ve ever seen (with the exception
of Robocop 2). I’ve never heard or
seen more disgusting sound effects
in a film before. The plot was sim-
ply too predictable in that nice, yet
tough, “cop wants a vacation’ way
(as in Die Hard, Commando, and
countless other films). The only
thing that made this film tolerable
(no, tolerable is too strong a
word); the only reason I didn’t
bolt upright and leave was primar-
ily that I wasn’t paying to see the
film with my own money.

At any rate, another reason I
didn’t leave was that there was
indeed an update on modem gore
effect technology. You'll all be

happy to know that the simulated
bone-breaking industry is indeed
alive and well, which is more than
I can say for Segal’s victims.

As an interesting addition to
this article, I decided to personally
interview each member of the
audience (there were eight of us).
I felt a bond with these people.
We all squirmed with disgust at
the same parts, and moaned with
anguish at the same parts. I felt a
bond, that is, until I talked to
them...

The other six people in the
theater, barring myself and my
companion, appeared to be
excited to see this film. After the
wretched thing I couldn’t wait to
get some verbal outlashes from
these people. Boy, was I sur-
prised. If I may quote:

“Tame... great... a cool
movie... 2 thumbs up... love Ste-
ven Segal... I personally liked the
eye gouging, culcium cracking,
bone-breaking action...” Well,
there you have it. Meanwhile, my
companion kept screaming one
word, “Reimbursement!”

This film was horrid, abso-
lutely disgusting. The reggae
music was a treat, even though
they played the same song
through the whole film, but I
haven’t heard that many bones
cracking since my Aunt Esther
tried to bend over to pick up her
remote control. If nothing else
came of my trip to see this film, at
least I got to meet the people who
thrive on action, violence, and
bloodbath genre films — all six of
them...Have a nice yesterday and
a pleasant next Thursday.

Chapel Choir highlights
Acis and Galatea opera

Homecoming provided on and off-campus talent

By Jill Myrom
Staff Writer

The Rooke Chapel Choir,
the Brewer Chamber Orchestra,
and four individual soloists
teamed up to perform Handel’s
opera Acis and Galatea on the
first night of Homecoming.
Rudolph Palmer, a 1973 Bucknell
graduate, conducted the ensemble.
The choir, instrumentalists, and
individual singers complemented
one another well, on the whole
creating a strong rendition of the
opera.

While the Chapel Choir
dominated the stage visually, its
role in the actual production was
unfortunately a minor one, due to
the way the opera was written to
be performed. The dominant
actors of the evening were the two
main characters, Acis and Galatea,
who were performed by Grayson
Hirst and Julianne Baird, a tenor
and a soprano with impressive
accomplishments, Joining them as
soloists were Frederick Urrey, a
tenor, singing the part of Damon,
and John Ostendorf, a bass. Osten-
dorf played the part of Polyphe-
mus beautifully, his rich, low
voice embodying the ill the char-
acter bodes for the poor Galatea.

The Brewer Chamber
Orchestra did an impressive job
with the score, striking a good bal-
ance with the singers by being nei-
ther overbearing, nor, at the other
extreme, drowned out by the
voices. Behind the orchestra stood

ever seen,” Admission to the con-
cert is free and open to the public.

the 49 students who made up the
Chapel Choir. Their singing
reflected the long hours put in by
the students and William Payn,
their conductor. An unfortunate
aspect of the chorus pertained to
the costumes the women were
required to don. Their cerulean blue
dresses looked most uncomfortable,
not to mention breast-emphasizing.
Though the audience’s attention
was visually drawn by the sea of
blue women, the choir only sang
during seven of the eighteen songs.
The three elements of the opera
(the choir, orchestra, and soloists)
seemed especially divided and sep-
arated from one another due to their
arrangement on the stage and the
difference in costume for each
group, making it difficult to con-
centrate fully upon the work.

An air of gloom seemed to
hang like a cloud over the majority
of the choir, which did indeed
match the mood of Act II, though it
seemed out of place in the first act
when the choir sang such lyrics as,
“Happy, happy, happy we! What
joys I feel, what charms I see...”
The choir sang with strength and
pleasing harmony; many of us
wished to hear more from them in
the opera.

The simple plot structure per-
haps lent itself to the insipid lyrics
which occasionally popped up in
the course of the night. Polyphe-
mus, a cyclops, falls in love with
Galatea, an exquisite nymph.
Unwilling to return the affections
of such a monster, Galatea instead

loves a shepherd named Acis.
They are blissfully happy until
Polyphemus’ envy leads him to
kill Acis, crushing him beneath a
boulder. Grieving, Galatea turns
the shepherd into a river. The
original myth did not include the
character Damon, but Handel
added him as a commentator.

While Handel’s style of
Opera is not intended to be acted
Out with costumes and a set, a
measure of perceptible acting was
included by both Galatea and Pol-
yphemus. Even when not singing,
Polyphemus would subtly react to
the words of the other characters
through facial expression. The
awkwardness of not acting out the
plot more fully became evident
after Acis had supposedly been
killed, when he remained seated
on stage, following the score as
the others wound down the
production.

It was unfortunate to note
that very few students were in
attendance. The audience seemed
to be made up primarily of local
residents and university faculty
and staff. A number of those I did
not recognize were most likely
alumnae returning for Homecom-
ing. The crowd responded posi-
tively to the production, but this
should not be surprising. Handel’s
style in Acis and Galatea is
closely akin to his well-
knownWater Music, and so he is
a sure-fire crowd-pleaser, ideal
for occasions such as
Homecoming.

The wheels are in motion

Student frustration erupted Wednesday night in what could have been a
tragic incident. Thanks to key administrators and student leaders, who saw the
5-hour demonstration to its end at 3:30 a.m. in front of the Bertrand Library, this
latest show of discontent ended without injury or major property damage.

President Sojka, Associate Vice President Weddle, Dean Dunlop and newly
appointed Director of Security and Safety Vincent DeCerchio managed to
coerce close to 200 police into giving students a chance to move their demon-

stration back on campus.

Once on campus, administrators showed their willingness to listen to and
address student concerns. Students should now realize that their voices are being

heard and their concerns are being actively addressed.

In coming weeks we will all be tested. The administration must now live up
to the promises made early Thursday morning and begin to act proactively

instead of reactively.

Students will be tested in a different way. We must now show the adminis-
tration that we are willing take responsibility for our actions and act in a mature
manner. Live up to the expectations of our peers, administration and neighbors
in Lewisburg. With more freedom also comes more responsibility.

As the media of the Susquehanna Valley portrays Wednesday night’s events
as a “group of drunken kids” upset over Pennsylvania drinking laws, we must be
reminded that the central issue should not be Act 31. The University cannot
stand idly by, allowing students to violate state law.

Accountability, equity and fairness are the issues. The days of an overzeal-
ous Department of Security and Safety are over. The administration is finally
ready to address our concerns and create a system in which everyone in the Uni-
versity Community knows the rules of the game.

The point has been made. We have the administration’s attention; use it.

Before I get into the atrocious
article printed in last week’s Buck-

to state my personal views about
the administration. I have worked
with many administrators on Orien-
tation over the past two years,
mainly with people from the Divi-
sion of Student Life. Because these
are the people who have the most
contact with the students, they are

also the ones subjected to the most
criticism—and their policies are the
ones that directly affect students, so
it is important that they are able to
relate to the students and under-
stand them. Just from my limited
personal experience I can say that
the Student Life staff were by far

tive college experience. However,
they are human—they all make
mistakes at one time or another and
they all have personality flaws, just
like the students (including the
Bucknellian staff). Students tend to

Professor requests correction
on Bucknell ranking article

To the Editor:

I trust that others in the Bucknell community
have written to you requesting corrections to your
article of Oct. 12, 1990. Your major mistake is
understandable. You say that “Bucknell was ranked
at the top of the second quartile...” instead of some-
thing like Bucknell was ranked in the top quartile but
not among the top twenty-five within the quartile. It
took a number of page turnings with the tables in the
U.S. News and World Report for me to see how they

had constructed their tables.

May I point out that your second paragraph is
misleading as well. The list of items suggests differ-
ent items rather than just the headings within the

mation does stay the same is difficult to see. It is hid-
den in all of that percentile transfer stuff in the fine

print by the tables.

One way of writing that second paragraph
would have been to insert the phrase “which were
based on” between the item “...student satisfaction”
and the item “SAT/ACT scores...” in your para-
graph. Also you might have had to add something
since academic reputation was based on ratings of
administrators, not in your list.

caption to the graph on the front
page states: “Administrators were

numbers mean and what were they
rated on? How well they dress? If it
was, the numbers probably would
have been drastically different. The

Student responds to
philanthropy article

To the Editor:

1 am writing in response to
the article in the October 26th
edition of The Bucknellian,
which noted the philanthropic
achievements of eight of the fra-
ternities and sororities at Buck-
nell. I applaud The Bucknellian
for its efforts to publicize the
beneficial aspects of Greek life
at Bucknell; however, I feel the
article presented a limited view
of the Greek philanthropic activi-
ties which take place on our
campus.

There are 20 Greek frater-
nities and sororities at Bucknell,
as well as other service organiza-
tions such as Alpha Phi Omega
and Habitat for Humanity.
Surely the service projects of all
these organizations deserve rec-
ognition. More specifically,
Delta Gamma’s Anchor Splash,
which will take place this Satur-

day, November 3, from 1-4 p.m.,
is a campus-wide swim meet
which the sorority organizes and
sponsors annually. The swim
meet is open to the entire campus
and raises nearly $1000 for the
Williamsport and Sunbury
Branches of the Pennsylvania
Association for the Blind and the
Delta Gamma Foundation.

Anchor Splash is just one
example of the variety of philan-
thropic activities which were
overlooked in The Bucknellian’s
article on October 26th. I encour-
age The Bucknellian to extend
recognition and credit to the
many organizations omitted from
the article.

Seniors question inconsistency
of tailgating alcohol policy

To the Editor:

If you were at the tailgating
party on Saturday, you may feel the
same way we do. It all started Par-
ents Weekend three weeks ago. For
some peculiar reason, Bucknell
Security adopted a laissez-faire atti-
tude when dealing with the “‘open-
container” drinking which was ram-
pant outside Christy Mathewson
Stadium. The scene was set on that
Saturday afternoon, parents,
alumni, and students (legal and not)
alike, consuming alcohol with little
concern for the rules and regula-
tions governing this institution. If

you happened to glance at the
Security Log of last week’s Buck-
nellian, no alcohol violations were
reported.

Tt wasn’t until this past week-
end that we truly noticed Buck-
nell’s policies were becoming, if
they hadn’t already, inconsistent. In
our four years as Bucknell students
we’ve seen the alcohol policies
regarding student “controlled”
social activities become more and
more stringent. However, adminis-
trative hands-off policies regarding
the consumption of alcohol at
events like Homecoming tailgating
parties and Parents Weekend have

continued to be maintained. By 11
a.m. out on Swartz field, the kegs
were flowing and the Pounders
were being pounded, and Security
seemed blind to all around them.
They were out there mingling
among the alcohol consuming stu-
dents and alumni, yet there was no
“21 year old section” and no I.D.
inspection. So let’s get something
straight; when it comes to parents
and alumni, the economic force
behind the upkeep of this Univer-
sity, school and state alcohol poli-
cies are waived. However, when

Reporting of Administration
survey lacks statistical integrity

By Travis Elliott

} The article in last week’s
Bucknellian entitled, “Administra-
tion receives mid-term grades”
made a number of inferences from
a survey which simply does not
stand up to statistical scrutiny.

Perhaps the article should
have been titled “Student apathy
abounds” since only 11% of the
288 upperclass students contacted
responded to the survey. No defi-
nite conclusions can be drawn as to
the overall opinion of upperclass
students from the opinions of only
31 students because of the
extremely low response rate of only
11%.

However, in the article,
Brian Davison ’91 reports, “Overall
opinions of Bucknell have
declined, both among Greeks and
independents.”

A number
of weaknesses
exist in this
Claim. First, the
sampling
method used in
the survey,
namely sending
out a direct mail
Survey, is a poor
method of collecting data. Would
students who are particularly upset
with the administration and Buck-
nell be more likely to respond to
the survey? Of course, they would.
Those who have strong opinions
will take the time to fill out the sur-
vey and return it while those who
have more moderate opinions
would most likely throw the survey
away.

If the survey was conducted

and accompanying visual aids
claim that the survey slams the
administration, only one paragraph
is actually about the administration.
The rest is about the changing
social scene on campus, which has
mainly been a result of Act 31.
Somehow the students have been
managing to peg the responsibility
for this law on the administration
because they have had to enforce it,
as if the 21-year-old drinking age
law was written by the Bucknell
administration.

One of my roommates
received the Bucknellian survey,
but she never answered it because
she felt that she didn’t know any of
the administrators well enough to
give an opinion of them. I wonder
how many of those 32 respondents
actually know those people well
enough to give an informed opinion
of them. I, on the other hand, know
these administrators, and, while
they would not all receive a 10 on
the rating scale, if that is indeed the

these individuals leave the school,
the school and state alcohol poli-
cies are once again enforced, prov-
ing that, as we have seen, Bucknell
students do not account for much.
So, if you are going to insti-
tute rules regarding the serving and
consumption of alcohol on campus,
then let them be fair, just and con-
sistent. If you play fair with us,
then we’ll play fair with you. And
to tell you the truth, Saturday after-
noon was the best time we had all
semester. It wasn’t because we
were intoxicated, but rather
because we knew that we could

rate could have been greatly

improved and the results would be

more definitive. For instance, by

polling students over the phone, the

survey would

to get a much

11%, and hence,

dent opinion at Bucknell.

time last year, but instead, the stu-
dents surveyed were asked, “...what
they thought of Bucknell a year
ago.” In no way can the mood of a
year ago be reproduced by asking
students what they had thought last
year. To really legitimize this
claim, the same survey would have
had to have been conducted last
year and compared to the results of
this year’s survey. Clearly, the stu-
dents who responded to the survey

highest, they would all score much
better.

Of course, this brings up
another point. Whose fault is it that
none of these students know the
administrators well enough to give
an informed opinion? Why is it that
I do know them? It’s certainly not
due to any lack of effort on the part
of the administration. Students are
constantly being begged to get
involved, most recently with TIP,
but also with BSG, BAC, Orienta-
tion...the list is nearly endless.
Even the trustees allowed students
to meet with them, and they
showed a genuine interest in the
students’ concerns. It’s difficult for
the administrators to get out and
meet all the students, but they do
their best, and the students need to
make more of an effort to get
involved at Bucknell and its staff
before they criticize either too
harshly.

Sincerely,

about being unfairly hassled by the

perceived their opinions of the Uni-
versity, to have been higher last
year at this time, but perception
changes significantly over time.
People often idealize the past.

... The sampling method used in
the survey, namely sending out
a direct mail survey, is a poor
method of collecting data.

In any case, a copy of the
survey with the exact questions
asked should have been printed
with the article. If the questions are
asked in a biased manner then the
responses will be effected accord-
ingly. In addi-
tion, the
method of
selecting the
288 upperclass
students should
have been
reported. If
these students
were not cho-
sen by a ran-
dom method, then the sample of
288 students was not representative
of the student population at Buck-
nell. Unfortunately, no conclusions

can be deduced in these areas
because the relevant information
about the survey did not appear in
the article, but it does leaves the
Treader to wonder.

The hy-
pothesis that the
upperclass _stu-
dents are dissatis-
fied with the Uni-
versity and the
administration is
a reasonable one,
but it remains
just that, a
hypothesis, until
it is backed up
with reliable statistical proof. Per-
haps this article would have been
better placed on the opinions page
than the news section. As a news
article, the inconclusive nature of
the statistical survey results should
have been stressed.

In any case, this illustrates
the importance of statistical integ-
Tity in reporting. Irresponsible
reporting of survey results not only

but it also provides evidence for
those who would claim that the

hope that we have learned some-

Freshman Forum

By Jim Joseph

Last weekend, as we all
know, was Homecoming. For me,
this should be a time of great
school spirit and unity. This last
word is important. Unfortunately,
it seemed to many freshmen as if
this celebration did not include
them. Of course they went to the
football game and cringed at the
heartbreaking loss to Colgate.
But that did not fill the whole
weekend. The problem arose
when we asked ourselves what to
do after the game.

Alumni went back to their
fraternities or sororities, as did all
of the current members of the
Greek system. But where could
the freshmen go? We do not in
any way blame the Interfraternity
Council for this minor dilemma.
It is their right to decide if at cer-
tain times it is not in their best
interests to admit freshmen into
their houses, and I am sure that
on this weekend they had strong
reasons for arriving at this deci-
sion. However, it is known that
on the normal weekend the frater-
nities are a great source of recrea-
tion for freshmen. So, on the one
weekend when they decide not to
let us into their houses, shouldn’t
somebody somewhere have
offered alternative activities for
the freshmen?

I think that the answer to
this question is an emphatic
“YES.” After all, this is the

Pleasantness pales to free

By M.D. Christopher

I would like to comment
upon the brief article about Buck-
nell University in the October 14
issue of the New York Times, p. 39.
For those of you who are not
informed, the issue which brought
our University the attention of the
largest single newspaper in the
entire world was the attempt by the
Bucknell Student Government to
ban the use of chalk as a form of
expression on the campus.

I would like to express my
concern for Mr. Eisenstein, whose
use of the word “esthetics” was, at
best, awkward, and at worst, incor-
rect. Use a dictionary, Mr. Eisen-
stein, before you allow yourself to
be quoted by the New York Times. I
would also like to point out that
within the confines of your argu-
ment, the insipid allowance that
“though the content of the writing
may have credible thoughts and
opinions...” is merely giving lip-
service to the idea that the accep-
tance and exploration of ideas,
political or otherwise, is a valuable
quality in an individual and in a
society. Don’t bother.

I would like to thank, on the
other hand, Brian Selmeski, the
junior class representative who had
the sense, or lacked the political
Savvy, to point out the obvious: the
essence of a liberal arts institution
is the ideal that “There should be
no restriction on _ intellectual
thought and expression.” I person-
ally feel that it is possible for a
group such as P.O.W.E.R. to exist
at Bucknell because all other forms.
of expression for their ideas have
been severely oppressed, or
silenced. I found tremendous resis-
tance to the discussion of feminism
and women’s issues, and even to
simple outspokenness on any sub-
ject by a female, during my years

here. Wake up, people; women’s
issues are not a dying subject, the
Women’s Movement is not over,
and Feminism is a_ fantastically
diverse title covering many issues
and many viewpoints, many of
them conflicting. Bucknellians, stu-
dents, faculty and administration,
may try to silence the voices of

those who wish to change this pris-
tine, “traditional” environment, but
when an entire issue of Time Maga-
zine (this week’s) is devoted to the
current issues involving women,
how long can you afford to keep
your eyes, and your minds, closed?

As a sterling example of the
above, I would submit to you this
fine piece of political bullshit of
which our esteemed Dean Dunlop
is a master non pareil. “The vast
majority of our students who object

to the chalk talk see the appearance
of the writing as a defacement of
the university’s property. I don’t
think they’re trying to curtail free
speech or freedom of expression.”
For all of those who wish to pursue
a career in American politics, listen
closely. Dean Dunlop has reduced
the argument to its two viewpoints:

(Risen

vy

the right to freedom of expression
and the issue of private property.
The only way that the chalking
could be banned to preserve visual
pleasantness, as Mr. Eisenstein
desired, would be on the grounds
that the campus is private property.
Those who favor freedom of
expression are either in agreement
with the issues that are being raised
by this political activity, or they are
aware that the curtailment of any
particular political view leads to the

school which is so adamantly
against under-age drinking. What
do they think generally happens
when some 900 students do not
have anything to do on a week-
end? The inevitable result is
heavy drinking in the dormitories.
Now I know that many of you
think that this occurs on any
weekend. But when there are no
bands to listen to and no movies
to watch, what is the final alterna-
tive? Homework? Let’s not kid
ourselves. There must be some
sort of activity planned for fresh-
men when there is no alternative
recreation.

I feel that it is the responsi-
bility of the BAC, the administra-
tion, and the BSG to make enter-
tainment available. Anything
would suffice: a band, a movie,
even a comedian in the Weis Cen-
ter. If the availability of such
activities keeps five people from
drinking then the administration
has helped to avoid potential trou-
ble for that handful and for those
who still choose to drink, some
from of entertainment has been
offered to enhance their jovial
manner. The important thing is
that an effort is made to satisfy
everybody and the attitude of the
powers-that-be does not leave the
freshmen to fend for themselves.
This way, nobody can complain.
The effort was made and if some-
body did not have fun then it’s
their fault. The rest of us can still
go out and have a good time.

speech

oppression of all political dialogue,
and they are more concerned with
preserving their own rights than
curtailing those of others. Thus, pri-
vate property or no, they support
the freedom of expression on the
campus. Those who oppose free-
dom of expression, on the other
hand, must come up with some-
thing other than “I oppose first
amendment rights.” The answer is
to avoid at all costs the issue of
freedom of expression completely,
and maintain that the chalk writing,
no matter what the content, is
offensive because it detracts from
the neat appearance of the grounds
of the University. Here is the clever
part, folks; by addressing only one
side of the argument, Dean Dunlop
masks his personal views behind
the view he attributes to certain stu-
dents, carefully stating that an
unknown number of them are
opposed to the chalking, but that of
those students, a vast majority are
against the writings only for the
sake of campus tidiness. In the
world of politics, it seems, one
Must not acknowledge opposing
arguments in any way. Thus, he
hands over to those students who
wish to be spared the constant
exposure to political views radi-
cally different than their own opin-
ions a clear and smugly neutral rea-
son for supporting this desire.

I enjoyed the blatant contrast
between the words of the above
administrator and the President of
the Bucknell Student Govemment,
David Skena: “I’m afraid that a lot
of the students wanted to ban the
chalk talk strictly because of the
content of the messages. The writ-
ings bother me, but I don’t think
it’s proper to shut it off.” Like Mr.
Selmeski, Dave Skena has the
sense, or lacks the political savvy,
to state the obvious.

Field hockey finishes 8
season with 3-0 loss

By Julie McCausland and
Scooter Van Kirk
Staff Writers

The women’s field hockey
team ended their 1990 season last
Tueday, bowing to Ursinus in a 3-0
loss, and culminating in a record of
4-12-1.

Entering into the newly
formed Patriot league, Bucknell
anticipated close, equally matched
contests from schools with similar
athletic and academic programs.
Included in the Patriot league are
old E.C.C. rivals Lehigh and Lafay-
ette and new conference members
Colgate and Holy Cross, the latter
of which the Bison had never
played. Finishing 1-3-0 in the con-
ference netted the Bison fourth
place just ahead of Lehigh.

With the entire squad retum-
ing next year the Bison are main-
taining their core nucleus, which is
quintessential to any cohesive play-
ing unit. jue Wells *93 summar-
ized,” We aren’t losing any seniors,
we have the entire off-season to
work out any kinks, and from this
point things can only get better.”

The Bison travelled to Phila-
delphia hoping to end their 1990
season with a much-needed win.
But it was not to be. The Bison sur-
rendered 29 shots and three goals to

the Bears while generating only 13
shots of their own. Both Bucknell
goalies got a work out with
Danielle Ward °93 totalling 16
saves with three goals against in the
first half and Jen Corrigan ’94 mak-
ing 12 saves in the second.

Coach Jen Averill com-
mented, “There were some close
ones where we could have capital-
ized there in the second half.”
Unfortunately, the Bison couldn’t
muster that last push.

In what could only be termed
as “disappointing,” by team co-
captain Jeanette Aurand ('92), the
Bison fell to longtime rival Drexel
on Monday by a score of 2-1. The
Drexel Dragons scorched the Bison
with their heated intensity, driving
in both of their goals in the first
half. Drexel kept goalie Ward busy
forcing her to make thirteen saves,
while Drexel’s goalie went practi-
cally uncontested with four saves.

The Bison, who were down
the entire game, managed to score
with just eight minutes remaining
in the second half. The goal was
scored by Stef Carfley 93 and
assisted by Jeanette Aurand.

The Bison have suffered
from lackluster play at times this
year and must hope to bring a more
consistent effort to their games in
the 1991 season. They aspired to

the level of play of nationally
ranked Delaware (#18), earning a 0-
0 tie and then conceded to a sub-
stantially subpar Division III team,
and one has to wonder where they
stand and if they have the drive to
be competitive on a day to day
basis.

It is conceivable that the loss
of half of the forward line to inju-
ries hampered the Bison’s bid for
conference victories. Almira Bald-
win ’94, who was named Patriot
league player of the week for her
winning efforts and finished third in
team points, and speedster Alison
Arth ’93 were both lost to ankle
injuries near the end of their 1990
season. One can only speculate to
what extent their absence has
affected the team’s overall cohe-
siveness, and anticipate their return
for next year.

Looking towards next sea-
son, Coach Averill is confident that
her team will successfully attain the
cohesiveness it found elusive many
times this year. With the entire
team retuming, coupled with the
fact that it has been playing
together for such a long time, Ave-
rill feels the team will have an edge
Over younger teams. The Bison will
capitalize on their maturity and
game sense which they have devel-
oped over the years.

Volleyball finishes last in

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The beleaguered women’s
volleyball team will put an end to a
dismal season tomorrow when they
face off against Coach Opalski’s
former squad, the Golden Eagles of
Clarion University.

Bucknell was unable to give
their new coach any league wins in
the inaugural Patriot League sea-
son, as they lost its final two con-
ference matches to Lehigh and
Lafayette last weekend. However,
Opalski is quick to point out sev-
eral improvements.

“Our work ethic has defi-
nitely improved,” said Opalski,
“and a result of this greater work
ethic is individual improvement.
Also, we have one of the best side-
out games in the league, meaning
we play pretty well on defense, its
just that our offense has to get
going. Finally I think our transition
game, where we switch from
offense to defense is improving, a
little late but perhaps in time for the
tournament.”

Bucknell’s first match last
weekend was against the Lady
Leopards of Lafayette, who came
in the match with a 7-12 record, 1-4
in the conference. The Lady Bison
came out strong and snagged the
first game 15-12, behind powerful
serving by co-captain Kris Colbert
‘91 and Stacy Sontheimer ‘92.
Each had five service winners in
the match. However, Lafayette
responded by taking the next three
games 15-13, 15-11, 16-14, but not
without a strong fight from Buck-
nell’s other co-captain Kara Forosi-

sky ‘92, who had 16 kills for the
match along with two aces.

“We had an excellent serving
match, but we just weren’t able to
muster up enough momentum,”
stated Opalski. “Lafayette was defi-
nitely beatable, and I really feel we
could take them if we see them in
the tournament.”

Bucknell did not fare as well
against Lehigh, who came into the
match with a similar record to
Bucknell’s (3-19). Lehigh came out
strong from the opening whistle, as
they took advantage of 18 Bucknell
serve-reception errors along with
23 attack errors.

The Lady Engineers took the
match in three straight games 15-7,
15-8, 15-7. Colbert and Forosisky
led the Lady Bison attack with six
kills each.

“We had a lot of unforced
errors against Lehigh,” commented
Opalski. “We are being aggressive,
but we are still making way too
many errors at this point in the
season.”

Last Tuesday Bucknell tried
to put its conference problems
behind, taking on old East Coast
Conference foe Delaware. But the
Lady Blue Hens would not give an
inch to the Lady Bison, as Dela-
ware walked all over the hosts 15-
3, 15-5, 15-2, Forosisky continued
to prove herself as a dominant
player, recording 10 kills in the los-
ing effort.

“Kara (Forosisky) is a quality
player,” stated Opalski. “I think she
smells the tournament coming and
is priming herself for the tourna-
ment. She has great floor leadership
and exemplifies all the characteris-

tics a volleyball player should be.”
Bucknell will go for their
fourth win of the season tomorrow
at 1 p.m. in Davis gym as they take
on Clarion University. After that it
will have a week to prepare for the
Patriot League Tournament, to be

Water polo challenges
for MAC Championship

By Scott Pollins
Staff writer

Last weekend, Bucknell’s
water polo squad played a scrim-
mage against a tough alumni team
returning for homecoming. Several
of the alumni play for NYAC (New

league

held at Holy Cross.

The Lady Bison will be the
seventh seed in the tournament,
where they will take on the second

Crew teams compete in Schuylkill

By Kimberly Dobies

The Men’s and Women’s
crew teams traveled to Philadelphia
this past weekend to compete in the
Head of the Schuylkill Regatta.
Bucknell had entries in three
events: Men’s Lightweight Eights,
Women’s Heavyweight Eights and
Men’s Heavyweight Eights.

The Women’s eight, consist-
ing of bow Yuko Mera ‘93, Emily
Grill ‘92, Amanda Kessler ‘93,
Kathy Kolasheski ‘92, Shelly
Pleune ‘93, Shannon Owens ‘92,
Britta Manskopf ‘91, stroke
Gretchen Maton ‘92 and Coxswain
Robin Stutman ‘93, raced well and
placed 32nd out of 49 teams finish-

ing ahead of Patriot League rival
Lafayette. Among the competition
was Ithaca College, which placed
first in Boston at the Head of the
Charles.

Women’s captain Manskopf
commented, “Not having been on
the water for almost a week, we
were quite happy with our results,
especially considering the tough
competition in our heat.

Water conditions at home on
the Susquehanna kept all teams
from practicing for over a week
before the race. The water level
was very high and the current was
too strong to enable the boats to be
out. “Water time” is crucial for
blade work and technique. The

rowers kept in good condition,
however, by participating in strenu-
ous daily workouts.

As a result of the bad water
conditions, both men’s boats had
been off the water for nine days by
race time. The lack of water time
proved to be a definite weakness for
the men’s lightweights, who faced
the toughest competition of the day.
The lightweights consisted of bow
J.J, Guiliano ‘93, Scott Beatty ‘93,
Andy Bush ‘93, Brian Fetterolf ‘93,
Chris Norrie ‘93, Darryl LaRue
“*93, Edward Williams ‘93, stroke
Steve Kline ‘93, and coxswain Erin
Bums ‘93 raced against extremely
strong lightweight teams such as
Princeton, Navy, and Georgetown.

Although they rowed well,
the lightweights had a disappoint-
ing finish. When asked to com-
ment, Burns said, “Our rating was
lower than the competition, but we
rowed well considering we had
been off the water for nine days.”

Results were not available for
the men’s heavyweight event.
According to the men’s captain
Dave Rhodes ’92, "We had good
conditions and we used them to our
advantage.

Next weekend the men’s and
women’s varsity teams will be
joined by five novice boats when
they travel to Fairfax, Virginia to
compete in the Head of the
Occoquan.

York Athletic Club), a national polo
powerhouse located in the Empire
State. Returning Bison included all-
time scoring leader Scott Schulte
‘81, Garrin Kapecki ‘89, Truby
Voison ‘89, and Jim Harvey ‘89.

Coach Lynn Kachmarick
treasured the chance to play against
former teammates, assessing, “It
was great for us.” Kachmarick
played her entire squad in an effort
to give all her players ample play-
ing time. “It was a good break from
our long weekends of three to four
games,” she said.

Both teams baitled in front of
a loud homecoming crowd. The
alumni edged the current Bison
squad 11-9 in a contest that was
close the whole way. Schulte led
the alumni with five goals, while
Kapecki and Voison each scored
twice.

Kachmarick stressed, “It’s
really great for us to have an
alumni game, because so many of
our graduates are still playing.”
After the game, some of the alumni
worked with a couple of the present
team members. Their vast polo
experience helped and encouraged
the younger Bison.

This weekend Bucknell,
ranked #20 in the nation, travels to
Princeton University for the Mid-
Atlantic League Championships.
Kachmarick foresees “an extremely
competitive weekend.”

The key to the Bison’s suc-
cess this weekend will be the abil-
ity of Bucknell to get physically
and mentally prepared for all three
games. Bucknell, seeded second in
the tournament, looks to be a wor-
thy contender for the championship
title.

Women’s soccer
ends season 1-7

By Anne Taback
Staff Writer

The Lady Bison have com-
pleted their first varsity season
with a deceiving 1-7 record. Three
of the team’s victories were over
club teams and that doesn’t show
up in the standings. However, for a
first year varsity team they have
come a long way, and on the whole
the team and Head Coach Toby
Lovecchio are pleased.

The Lady Bison ended their
season with two games against
Lehigh and one game against
Lafayette. The first game against
the Lehigh Engineers took place in
Bethlehem on October 19. Buck-
nell hit the goal post four times in
the first twenty minutes of that
game, and according to the coach,
outplayed Lehigh the majority of
the game.

Offensively, Bucknell took
37 shots as opposed to Lehigh’s
16. The team just had a hard time
scoring. The only goal for the Lady
Bison came at 23:35 in the first
half, when forward Chris O’Lare
‘93 chipped the ball to midfielder
Mandy Head ’92. Head one-timed
the ball, sending a shot into the
back of the net from about twelve
yards out. With only three minutes
left in the game, Lehigh tied it up

‘ when a foul was called on the Lady

Bison from twenty-five yards out.
One of the Engineer midfielders
took a direct kick which bounced
into the box and one of her team-
mates was there to follow it up for
the goal. The game ended in a 1-1
tie.

Sweeper Stephanie Porcaro
‘93 was out of action, so Shannon
Smith ‘92 moved into her position,
doing an outstanding job. Genine
Streeper ‘92 moved to stopper and
Nicola Stojak ‘93 came off the

bench to start the last four games at
right back. Smith and Stojak made
the adjustment well. The game was
summed up well by Lovecchio,
“We should have won. That became
obvious after the next Lehigh
game.” Co-captain Dana Esse ’91
felt that Lehigh had the same cali-
ber of talent as the Lady Bison:
“We were even,” she said. “We
were on the same level.”

In the game against Lehigh
Homecoming weekend here at
Bucknell, the teams clashed under
the lights. After a 1-1 tie in a game
that they felt they should have won,
the Lady Bison were confident and
ready to play. Co-captain Christina
Baselga ‘91 played an outstanding
game, tallying both goals of the 2-0
shutout. Her first goal came at
28:56 in the first half, when for-
ward Amy Krause ‘91 pushed the
ball through the Engineers’ defense,
and Baselga was there to collect it.
She took the shot from about eight
yards out, capitalizing on the assist.

The second goal came at
39:22, when Baselga took a direct
kick from about 25 yards out. The
ball landed in the upper right hand
corer of the net—"the goalie never
had a chance,” said Lovecchio. He
continued, “‘She’s been one of the
Most consistent people on the team
this year and it was nice to see her
do as well as she did that night.”

The conditions for the game
were windy and cold, but that
didn’t stop the Lady Bison defense
from playing a great game as well.
“Whenever you shut a team out, it’s
a good sign,” said Lovecchio.
“They made no mental mistakes or
errors. The offense worked the ball
well, a lot of one-touches and good
ball movement.” Krause felt that
the defenders played well also. “It
was a pretty good game,” she said.

Breakin’ Bison take new
look to the hardwood

By Chris Drowne
Staff Writer

When evaluating this year's
men's basketball squad it would be
easy to consider the Breakin’ Bison
as a team in its rebuilding stages
following the graduation of two
first-team all-conference players in
Mike Joseph and Greg Leggett.
However, this would also be
neglecting the nucleus of returning
lettermen as well as the new
freshmen

Co-captains Keith Fenton ‘91
and Bill Courtney ‘92 provide expe
rience and leadership at the shoot-
ing and point guard positions
respectively. Fenton averaged 8.0

points per game off the bench after
starting the first seven games last
season.

Courtney (10.6 ppg, 2.5 apg)
started the final 22 games and fin-
ished among the league’s leaders in
free throw percentage (.838) and
three point shooting (.419). “I feel
much more confident going into
this season as opposed to last
because I’ve had a year of experi-
ence at my position,” added Court-
ney. Russell Peyton ‘93 (16 ppg,
5.3 apg, 3.7 steals pg for the JV
team) and Chris Simpson ‘94 help
to make the Bucknell backcourt one
of the strongest in the new Patriot
League.

electrified the Davis Gym crowd
with his numerous slam dunks on
his way to All-Rookie honors.
Bright started all 29 games last win-
ter, averaging 10.8 points, 7.1
rebounds, and 1.9 steals per game.
The latter two statistics ranked him
among the league’s best.

Bright is joined in the front-
court by a host of Bison who saw
playing time last season. Steve
Leshinski ‘91, Mike Diver ‘91, and
Paul Olkowski ‘93 shared the cen-
ter position last season. Leshinski,
who finished second in the confer-
ence in blocked shots with 1.2 per
game, started the first 23 games
before giving way to Diver in the
final six. Olkowski grabbed 4.2
rebounds per game while averaging
just over 13 minutes per game.

The second forward position
will most likely be shared by Pat
King ‘92 and Mike Walsh ‘92.
King led the JV team in scoring
(19.1 ppg) and rebounding (11.6
tpg) while shooting .631 from the
floor. Walsh played mostly JV last
season averaging 12.4 points and
7.8 rebounds per game. Olkowski,
Matt Clark ‘93, and Raymond
Brown ‘94 could also see some
time at this position.

Tomorrow night at 7:30 in
Davis Gym, the Breakin’ Bison will
take on the Verich Reps in their
only pre-season game. The semi-
pro team from Ohio does not
include any of the same players
who won last year’s contest 98-92.
Admission is free to all students
with B.U. I.D., $2 otherwise.

The team begins its regular
season with the San Juan Shootout
November 23-25. Joining the Bison
in sunny Puerto Rico will be St.
Louis, Old Dominion, Northern
Iowa, American University of
Puerto Rico, Illinois, and Murray
State. Popeye Jones and company
from Murray State will play Buck-
nell in the opening round.

Head Coach Charlie Wool-
lum refers to this year’s schedule as
“the toughest early on that we’ve
had in recent years.”

“Every game is going to be a
challenge for us. Our schedule is
packed with strong teams from the

end” added Courtney.

Prior to their Patriot League
opener against Holy Cross, the
Breakin’ Bison will be tested by
opponents who have been picked to
win their respective conferences
such as Yale, Fairfield, and St.
Francis (PA).

The Patriot League promises
to be difficult this season. Lehigh,
Holy Cross, Fordham, and Lafay-
ette will provide Bucknell with its
toughest challenges from within the
league. “We met the challenge of
our last conference (East Coast
Conference), and I don’t see any
reason why we can’t do the same in
our new conference,” commented
Coach Woollum after a long prac-
tice Thursday night.

The winner of the Patriot
League tournament at Holy Cross
March 2-4 will play the winner of
the Northeast Conference for the
right to go to the NCAA
tournament.

Last season the vociferous
Davis Gym crowd propelled the
team to an 11-2 home record. Fen-
ton believes, “There isn’t a better
place to play. It may not be the

Championships. Berenyi captured

but it has the best floor and fan sup-
port of any place we play. It gives
us a definite edge in games, espe-
cially the close ones.”

“This is one of the youngest
teams that we’ve had here,” said
Coach Woollum. This young team
will strive for a more balanced
offense. “Everyone is going to have
to contribute offensively. We’re not
just going to sit around and watch
two people (Joseph and Leggett)
score 20 a night like we did last
year,” stated Courtney.

Fenton added, “We’re more
aggressive and feel that we have
something to prove to those who
picked us near the bottom. We
were a little complacent last year
after winning the E.C.C. in 1989
and are ready to make a run at the
tittle in the Patriot League.”

The young, but somewhat
experienced team, coupled with
strong crowd support could bring
the program back to “The Big
Dance” in March.

Women’s soccer

From page 13
“We knew we could beat them
from that 1-1 tie.”

Unfortunately the Lady Bison
ended their season with a disap-
pointing loss against Lafayette
According to Lovecchio, Lafayette
is a first year varsity team as well,
and has the same caliber of talent
as the Lady Bison. The game was
unbelievably windy but the Lady
Bison had their backs to the wind
and controlled the first half of the
game. Their only goal came at
25:00, when Krause passed the ball
to forward Alyssa Meade ‘94, who
took a shot from fifteen yards out.
The shot was deflected into the
back of the net by one of the Lafay-
ette defenders. The Lady Bison had
a 1-0 lead going into halftime, but
about twenty minutes into the sec-
ond half, Lafayette player Heidi

Caruso took a shot from about
twenty yards out to score. Goal-
keeper Kim Fekel ‘93 made a good
attempt at it but the wind was at
Caruso’s back and she had the
advantage. In Lovecchio’s opinion,
Caruso is one of the better players
in the Patriot League. The second
goal for Lafayette came on a corner
kick when the ball rolled across the
middle of the Lady Bison’s defense
and one of Lafayette’s players capi-
talized on it, taking a shot from five
yards out to score. Defensively, the
Lady Bison played well in that
game. According to Lovecchio, it
was the best first half of soccer the
team played all year. “We had
some nice opportunities in that
game,” he said. “Both teams were
passing the ball well... we had
some really good opportunities, we

just failed to capitalize on them.”

Goalkeeper Fekel played an
outstanding game in net these three
games, compiling 38 saves. “Kim’s
been solid back there,” said her
coach. “There’s just times when
this is going to happen with a team
like ours. We’re young and we’re
leaming.”

Overall, the team is pleased
with the progress it has made since
the beginning of the season. From
Lovecchio’s point of view, “When
we started off in the beginning,
everything was new for me, for the
players... it was a season of transi-
tion. When we started off as a
team, there were things they didn’t
know and I didn’t know and I tried
to teach them. I think we improved
a lot as the season went on, we're a
much better team now.”

received the ball with 4:27 left on
its own 45-yard line.

Bucknell drove the entire dis-
tance, finishing with an eight-yard
completion from Hatajik to tight
end Jeff Pape ‘92. Pape ended the
day with three receptions for 37
yards, including a 23-yard catch on
the play preceding the touchdown.
The key play of the drive was an
11-yard completion from Hatajik to
Walsh on a fourth-and-four.

The touchdown made the
score 28-27.

Head Coach Maranzana
called time out to decide whether
Bucknell should go for the tie or
attempt the two point conversion
for the win. He said, “We wanted
to win the game. We thought we
could complete the play, and it was
important to us as a football team
to get the win.”

Higgins echoed Maranzana’s
decision: “You have to go for it. It
was not a choice. You go for the
win at home and for the tie away.
He had to go for it.”

Hatajik rolled right and lofted

a pass for Scocca in the back of the
endzone, but it was tipped away,
leaving the Bison down by a point.
Bucknell was therefore
forced to attempt an onside kick
with just 55 seconds left to play.
The kick was perfect as it took a
high bounce in the air, just before
reaching the Red Raider front line.
The ball was recovered by a
leaping Gregg Gerstmyer ‘93 on
the Colgate 49. But on the next
play Hatajik was intercepted, as the
pass was deflected into a Colgate
defender, who brought the ball
back 36 yards to the Bucknell 29-
yard line, ending any Bison hope.
The interception marked the
sixth tumover of the game for the
Bison, the most Bucknell has com-
mitted since its first game this sea-
son, when it tumed the ball over
eight times against Hofstra

the Colonial League’s first team
last year. The defense of Holy
Cross also features seven returning
Starters from last year’s team that
beat Bucknell 35-6 in the Colonial
League Championship.

Maranzana believes Bucknell
will need a great effort in order to
win. “We have to play good foot-
ball,” he said. “We will have to
play error-free and inspired because
they are a good football team. A
win is not out of the realm of possi-
bilities. We still have a lot of confi-
dence, We're going to get in their
faces because we have not forgotten
about the way the pushed us around
last year.”

Bucknell will try to change
history, as the Bison have never
beaten Holy Cross in the six times
they have played each other.

“We're delighted to be
there,” said Reynolds in regard to
the tournament. “Any one of the
four teams is capable of putting
together the effort that’s going to
be needed to win it. All of the
teams are hungry, and it’s going to
be a great setting for an exciting
collegiate soccer tournament. We
hope we have a couple of more
good games in us, and, as the host
school, we would very much like to
be in those finals on Sunday.”

Top-seeded Bison prepare to host Lafafayette at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow

By Chad Bown
Staff Writer

With its status in the Patriot
League playoffs already deter-
mined and no more regular-season
league contests to play, the men’s
soccer team has used the last week
to make minor adjustments to fine-
tune its play for the upcoming
championship weekend. Bucknell
hosted a tough Buffalo squad last
Sunday and traveled to Penn State
on Tuesday to take on the Nittany
Lions for its final preparation

before hosting the inaugural
playoffs tomorrow and Sunday.
Bucknell took on an out-
standing University of Buffalo
team under cold and windy condi-
tions last Sunday at East Field.
Buffalo entered the game with a
14-1-1 record and a #9 ranking in
the latest Division II soccer poll.
The Bison had the first opportunity
to score as Steve Johnson ‘91 hit
the crossbar with a shot after a
flurry in front of the Buffalo net.
Buffalo capitalized on its
first attempt just 7:34 into the

game, when Brian Cribbs lofted a
shot into the wind that tricked
keeper Scott Racek ‘91, finding the
upper left corner of the net. The
score put Bucknell behind 1-0, and
though the Bison controlled most of
the play during the first stanza, they
found themselves with a halftime
deficit.

“We were a bit worried about
the wind because we had it at our
backs and couldn’t manage to score
in the first half.” said Jon Macken-
zie ‘93, “But everything seemed to
change in the second half and the

intended pass for wide receiver
Dan Scocca ‘91 fell incomplete.
The game marked the third time in
the last five years that the annual
clash between Colgate and Buck-
nell has decided by just a single
point. It appears the Bison have
found a strong football rivalry with
the Red Raiders that will be around
for many years in the future.

Bucknell started strong, led
by the play of its @
special teams.On
Colgate’s _ first
possession,
Blaine Fawcett
‘93 blocked a
punt and Bill Hig-
gins ‘91 recov-
ered the ball, and
to it all the way
back to give the
Bison the early 7-
0 lead.

Higgins
commented, “It
was a designed
play. Eric Jantzi
(91) took on the
tight end, and
Blaine, who is
one of the fastest
guys on the team,
came up to make

on the turnover, and its 2
field goal was unsuccessful. The
Bison defense played remarkably
with crucial goal-line stands on
Colgate’s first two possessions.
Bucknell took the ball and
drove 80 yards on 13 plays, culmi-
nating on a three-yard pass play
from Todd Hatajik ‘91 to Tom Mar-
tin ‘92 for the score. It was Martin’s
first career touchdown pass. The
drive was highlighted by runs of 14
yards by Matt Walsh ‘93, and 10
yards by Craig Cavlovic ‘91.
Walsh, filling in for the injured
Henesey who played sparingly, fin-
ished the day rushing for 84 yards
on 18 carries, both career highs.
The key play of the drive was a 21-
yard completion from Hatajik to
Dan Scocca ‘91 of 21 yards on
third-and-four. Scocca led the

yard

impressive passing by Dave Good-
win, who on the drive tossed for 58
yards, including an 18-yarder and a
14-yard completion, each coming
on third down.

Bucknell bounced right back
and scored on its next possession.
The Bison marched 60 yards in 10
plays, led by big plays from Hatajik
and Cavlovic. The drive ended with
a one-yard touchdown run up the
middle by Cavlovic. That made the
score 21-3 with 5:21 left to play in
the first half.

Colgate brought the halftime
score to 21-6 as Brown hit his sec-
ond field goal of the game, a 20-
yarder as time ran out in the half.
The drive, which started at Col-
gate’s own 18 with less than three
minutes to play, featured 11 passes
from Goodwin, eight which were
completed for 69 yards.

At halftime the - statistics

sree weighed heavily

on Colgate’s
side, yet they still
trailed by 15
points. But the
tide began to turn

ers began to capi-
talize on Buck-
nell’s
carelessness.

just lucky to be
there.”

Colgate drove 65 yards on its
next possession to the Bucknell
two-yard line before Tom Norton
fumbled the ball. Roosevelt Smith
“92 came up with the recovery, but
on the following play Brian Hene-
sey ‘92, who was playing the game
with a back injury, fumbled the ball

Bison receivers with four catches
for 45 yards.

The second quarter began
with a Colgate drive that consumed
over 6:30 off the clock. The Red
Raiders drove 53 yards in 13 plays
before settling for a 28-yard field
goal by Rick Brown to bring the
score to 14-3. The drive featured

liams. The touch-
down was set up
by two connec-
tions from Goodwin to George
Delaney, each for 32 yards. Dela-
ney finished the day with eight
catches for 172 yards. Colgate
attempted the two point conversion
to bring the score within a touch-
down but was unsuccessful.
Bucknell could not mount
any threat on offense, as Cavlovic

scoring came around.”

Bucknell started the second
half strong, and managed to score
just 2:09 after play resumed. Terry
Pelino ‘91 hit a crossing shot that
bounced off Buffalo keeper John
Brighton’s hands. The rebound
came to Dan D’Angelo ‘92, who
knocked it into the empty net to
knot the score at 1-1.

The Bison kept the pressure
on and had several more opportuni-
ties to score before Mackenzie
spearheaded an attack through the
Buffalo defense before making a
beautiful pass to a streaking Dave
Moser ‘94, who hit a bouncing ball
into the lower left corner, giving
Bucknell its first lead at 2-1. Buck-
nell continued to mount more pres-
sure as play continued, but Buf-
falo’s Brighton played an
outstanding game, thwarting the
Bison on numerous occasions to
keep his team close. It turned out to
be a wasted effort, as Bucknell was
too strong and held on for the 2-1
victory.

“Tt was one of the best games
we've had this year in terms of put-
ting it all together.” said Coach
Reynolds. “It was a real good team
effort, and not only that but our
(full)backs had a lot of poise and
good movement. Keith Goodling
“92 especially had a super game of
moving well and distributing the
ball well; he’s played solid for us
all season.”

The Bison took their five-
game win streak to Penn State on
Tuesday for the last game of the
regular season. Penn State con-
trolled most of the play, but the
Bison found themselves up 1-0
when Alex Kogan ‘94 took a pass
from Steve Johnson ‘91 and beat
the keeper to the lower right corner.
The lead was short lived, as the Nit-
tany Lions scored two quick goals
to take a 2-1 lead. The first score
came when an uncontested Eric Fri-
berg took a crossing pass and hit a
header past Racek. The second

came when a bad pass in the Buck-
nell defense led to a turnover and a
one-on-one attempt that Penn
State’s Tom Beckett took advan-
tage of by beating Racek again.
Both teams had many more scoring
Opportunities in this wide-open
game, but neither could manage to
score as the Nittany Lions took the
contest 2-1.

“Penn State is just so tough
because they’re so quick to the
ball.” said Reynolds. “We made
some good adjustments in the sec-
ond half and controlled more of the
play. It was a good effort, and
we’ve got nothing to be ashamed
about.”

fumbled the ball away and Hatajik
threw an interception on _ the
Bison’s first two possessions of the
second half. After the interception,
Colgate drove from its own 41-yard
line to score on a eight-yard touch-
down pass, bringing the score to
21-19 with just over three minutes
to play in the third quarter.

Bucknell fumbled again for
its third straight turnover, this time
coming from fumble by Henesey,
his second of the game. Hampered
by injury, he rushed only nine times
for 39 yards. Colgate recovered the
ball at its own 43 yard line, and
drove the entire distance, scoring on
the first play in the fourth quarter
on a 16-yard pass play. That made

the score 25-21, as the Red Raiders
took the lead for the first time.
Bucknell got the ball back
and was forced to punt the ball
after just five plays. Colgate drove
71 +yards, culminating with
Brown’s third field goal of the
game, this one from 31 yards out
for a 28-21 advantage. Colgate had
gained a seven-point lead on 22
consecutive second half points.
Higgins attributed part of the
turnaround due to the defense being
on the field so much in the second
half. “I think we were just a little
tired,” said Higgins. “It doesn’t
matter how well you are condi-
tioned, you are going to get a little
tired. If you give a quarterback like

Goodwin that many opportunities,
with his receivers, he’s going to
score. You can’t hold him forever.”
The next possession for the
Bison was started with an incom-
plete pass by Hatajik, who had the
wind knocked out of him and went
out for a play. On the next play
reserve quarterback Jeff Kelly ‘92
threw an interception at the Buck-
nell 28-yard line. Colgate advanced
the ball to the Bison 15 before
Brown attempted a 32-yard field
goal, but the kick was blocked.
Bucknell finally did make
some waves offensively, when it

and Vince DeCerchio, director of security and safety, also addressed student concerns.

Sojka holds open forum to
address student concerns

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

Responding to the near riot
which occured at a Seventh St.
block party on Oct. 31, administra-
tors spoke to students about the
alcohol policy during an open
forum on Nov. 6. Hundreds of stu-
dents packed into the Vaughn Lit.
Auditorium to hear President Gary
Sojka; John Dunlop, dean of stu-
dent life; and Vince DeCerchio,
director of security and safety; dis-
cuss the umiversity’s attitude
toward the alcohol policy and Act
31.

“This is clearly an extension
of the conversation that was going
on Wednesday night,” said Sojka,
who answered students’ questions
after they returned to campus last
Wednesday.

Sojka spoke of the forum as a
continuation of the discussion
which followed Wednesday night’s
events. The panel of administrators
fielded students questions and

emphasized the need for students
and administrators to devise a fair
policy while still complying with
Pennsylvania law.

Each of the administrators
made an opening statement and stu-
dents were able to see where
DeCerchio, recently hired, stands
on several issues.

DeCerchio said in his open-
ing statement, that “most impor-
tantly it’s important for the students
to know that I am a supporter of
student rights.”

“My approach is basically
that I’m always available to meet
with you as a group or as individu-
als and to discuss your problems,
our differences” regarding the alco-
hol policy, he said. DeCercio said
that the university is establishing a
student security advisory board “to
hear grievances and to review poli-
cies and procedures.” The commit-
tee will “reexamine policy guide-
lines and implimentations,” he said.

Once Sojka opened discussion to
the assembly, several students sug-

gested that students traveled to an
off-campus party because the uni-
versity does not allow groups on
campus to host registered parties
during the week. When asked by
one student if the university would
consider allowing mid-week par-
ties, Dunlop responded, saying,
“The answer unfortunatetly, at this
point, is no, you cannot have mid-
week functions with alcohol. How-
ever, we can have other kinds of
things during the week; you just
can’t have alcohol.”

Another student expressed
his concern that security has been
too strict in recent months. But
with a new emphasis on increased
student responsibility, Dunlop said,
“We want to give you an opportu-
nity ... to show us that we don’t
need to worry about that night
anymore.”

DeCercio said that security
would not be continuing Wednes-
day night checks as in the past
Additionally, security will handle
weekend parties in a different man-

Fees to increase 6.93%;

A 6.93% increase in the com-

Michael Moohr, professor of economics, announced the proposed tui-
tion and faculty increases.

$18,625 to $19,915. Moohr
explained that these increases are
not unreasonable when taken in
context of the 22 frame of referen-
ceschools with which Bucknell is
compared. Of these schools, Buck-

nell ranks number 20 in terms of
comprehensive fees and is $1300
below the average. He defended the
increase, by pointing out that the
student body is
expected to
decrease at a rate
of 1% per year
over the next five
years.

Moohr also
discussed a pro-
posal to create 25
additional faculty
positions. The
current student to
faculty ratio is
14.1:1 which is
the highest of the
frame of
reference
schools. These
additional faculty
members would
substantially
lower the student
to faculty ratio,
making it
approximately
12.5:1. Moohr
cited additional
reasons for the
increase in
faculty being that
some classes are
too large now and
that some classes
are not even
being offered in
certain
departmnets.
Another option that he would like
to see take place would be to use
one-third of these new faculty
positions to offer more freshman
and senior seminars.

BIO plans to disband due

By Tommy Abel
Staff Writer

“Bucknell —_International
Organization (BIO) has plans to
disassemble because we have no
money,” Bill Lee, president of BIO,
announced three weeks ago at a
BSG appropriations committee
meeting.

BIO has grown from 70 to
250 members in the past year, yet
the money that they received from
BSG appropriations went down
from $2840 last year to $1935 this
year. According to Dave Skena ‘92,
president of BSG, the reason that
BIO, as well as several other
groups have received less funding
is that “we have more groups and
each group is requesting more
money.” Skena contends that the
BSG has funds to give out only
64% of the money requested.

This leaves several student
groups in a precarious position.
According to Bill Lee, BIO has no
reason to exist if it can not get more
BSG funding. “Out of the seven

Assailant

By Steve Hoerter
Staff Writer

A female student was
assaulted while jogging on River
Road Wednesday, in the third case
of sexual harassment on or near
campus this
week.

The stu-
dent, whose iden-
lity is not being
revealed due to
the nature of the
case, was jogging
on River Road at
approximately
3:55 p.m.

Wednesday when

she was

approached by a

20 to 25 year-old

man. According

to the Depart-

ment of Security

and Safety, the

man “spoke to

her, placed his

arms around her

and threw her to

the ground.” The

student screamed,

ran away from

her assailant and

reported the inci-

dent to the

Department
Security
Safety. The assai-

lant fled the scene in an older
model light green Chevrolet sedan
with rust spots.

The assailant is being
described as a young man, five feet
six inches to five feet eight inches
in height, with a stocky build and
short brown hair, At the time of the
incident Wednesday, the assailant
was described as wearing a white
shirt and dirty jeans.

The Department of Security
and Safety issued a ‘Crime Alert”
Thursday to inform students of the
incidents. Over three hundred fly-
ers were posted around campus last
night.

According to Vince DeCer-
chio, director of security and
safety, two other incidents have
occurred this week. One attack
only hours before this most recent
incident, and the other occurred on
November 5.

The November 5 incident
also occurred during daylight
hours on River Road. A student,
whose name has not been released,
was the victim of verbal harass-
ment while jogging. She ran away
from her assailant, whose descrip-
tion is similar to that of the assai-
lant involved in Wednesday’s
assault, and reported the incident
to Security and Safety.

events we have each year, we were
appropriated for one event. This
event that we were appropriated
for was in April which means we
can’t do anything from now until
the time of the event.” With BIO
financially dead, Lee and his 250
members are “basically in limbo
because we don’t know if we
should disassociate and form a
committee to take care of that one
event.”

Lee is especially distressed
that his group did not receive the
$4254.16 that it asked for because
“we have 250 members on campus
and most of the members are not
involved in any other organiza-
tion.” Lee nojed that all students
contribute a $100 activities fee to
fund student organizations and
many BIO members who do not
belong to other organizations
aren’t getting their monies’ worth.

Lee said, “BIO was origi-
nally formed to provide a social
life for international students. We
make sure social events are pro-
vided so that international students

to lack of BSG funding

can integrate with American stu-
dents. With only two social events a
year, this is impossible.”

Lee explained that the univer-
sity seems to be contradicting itself.
On the one hand, according to Lee,
the university advertises _ its
attempts at diversity, but on the
other hand it fails to adequately
fund diverse organizations. “I’m
confused because the university
advertises Bucknell as being very
diverse, and it stresses its interna-
tional aspects, but on the other hand
they seem to be pushing us out of
existence.”

Scott Searle, BSG treasurer,
believes that student organizations
should not receive preferential treat-
ment because of the ethnic makeup
of its membership. According to
Searle, “He [Lee] is asking the
appropriations committee to treat
his organization based solely on its
ethnic makeup....”

Skena extended on this idea
and explained that the financial bur-

From page 1

Professor David Ray pre-
sided over this meeting in the L.C.
Forum, which opened with Presi-
dent Sojka answering questions
from the group. The majority of the
questions asked of Sojka concerned
the events leading upto the near
riot on the night of Halloween.

Professor John Cooper of the
chemistry department, in particular,
had many questions for the Presi-
dent about why no “disciplinary
action” was taken that night in “the
face of obvious violation.” Cooper
said, “There were open drinking
violations, peace was definitely
disturbed, and people’s property
was infringed upon.” He wondered
what kind of a message such a han-

dling of the incident gave to the
community, especially when, as he
pointed out, a similar incident
occurred that same night at Susque-
hanna, but disciplinary action was
taken and arrests were made there.
Cooper also wanted to know what
President Sojka said to the police
when he intervened and what
responsibility the university had for
the cost of gathering such a large
group of police and _ other
reinforcements.

President Sojka responded to
Cooper by explaining that his
“principal goal” as he viewed the
situation that night was “getting out
of there without anyone getting
hurt.” President
objective was to get “the students
off the street without any violence.”

Joe Clark, the former principal at Eastside High in Patterson,
New Jersey upon whom the movie Lean On Me was based, will
speak about his experiences and the future of American educa-
tion on November 14 in the Weis Center at 8pm.

Think you’ ve got it bad here at Bucknell? At Eastside High in
Patterson, New Jersey, there was a stabbing on the first day of
school in September 1981. The school was plagued by drug deal-
ers and delinquents, but when Joe Clark began his tenure as
principal of Eastside High things changed dramatically. Clark
started by expelling three hundred students and quickly turned
Eastside High into a model school. For his efforts, Clark was
named one of the nation’s 10 “Principals of Leadership” in 1986.
The incredible story of Joe Clark and Eastside High was made
into the hit movie Lean On Me starring Oscar-nominee Morgan
Freeman. On Wednesday, Joe Clark will share his experiences

History Curriculum expanded to
include race/class/gender studies

By Lisa Hirschkorn
Staff Writer

“The history department is
utterly committed to race, class and
gender,” said Mary A. Hill, profes-
sor and chair of history. A recent
curricular change affirms Hill’s
thoughts; that is, the requirement
that incoming history majors take
one course in race, class, or gender.

“T think the history of the his-
tory department has been a disad-
vantage and an advantage to us,”
Hill said. She explained “A lot of
students come to us and say, ‘why
don’t you teach more traditional
courses.’ We’ve hired a number of
people with specialties that we
think of as ‘service courses’ to the
university African History,
African-American History and our
own studies of courses. The result
is that we haven’t got as many
courses in what people think of as
traditional history.”

“The advantage, though, is
that I think we have made an
important contribution to the Uni-
versity. We've given sequence
courses in Afro-American History,
in women’s history and in environ-
mental concerns, which is a key
issue right now. We can’t make the
Tules retroactively but the require-
ment for incoming freshmen his-
tory majors is that they must take at
last one course in these
concentrations.”

Yet, changes within the his-
tory department constitute only a
small part of a complex debate.
This debate ensues within the Eng-
lish department, where proposals to
alter Bucknell’s curriculum are
pending. Whereas the revised his-
tory major will be effected next
fall, the English major will not be
formally changed until fall 1993.
This debate has also prompted the
University’s rethinking of the dis-
tribution requirements within the
College of Arts and Sciences.

“We've just gone through
discussion of a new program for
English majors,” said Robert Tay-
lor, professor and chair of English.
Taylor explained that the English
Department intends “to open up the
curriculum with courses of non-
canonical nature —— for example,
by bringing courses on women
writers and minority writers into
the mainstream of the curriculum.”

Responding to a “Cultural
Revisionism,” Taylor said the Eng-
lish Department debated whether to
require courses —— on minority
studies or women’s literature or lit-
erary theory —— that were not rep-
resented in the curriculum. Taylor
said, “By requiring one course in
one of those areas, we’d be saying
‘these are important, we urge you
to take note of them.’ We decided
instead to put the courses on an
equivalent basis...within the text of

Renaissance, and the eighteenth,
nineteenth and twentieth centuries).
Under the new system, “courses in
British literature, American litera-
ture, women’s literature and Afri-
can-American literature, and liter-
ary theory can fulfill this
requirement.” Secondly, the English
Department is proposing a “Prosem-
inar” in literary studies. The Pro-
seminar will link three writers from
different historical periods and
should be taken by majors in their

Mary Hill, chair and professor of history, will be responsible for insti-
tuting the first ever race/class/gender distributional requirement for

history majors.

the curriculum...it’s a more demo-
cratic way.”

Examining the department's
past, Taylor said “Truthfully, the
way it was structured viewed litera-
ture as ending in 1930, and mod-
ernist writers ended with
Joyce....The exclusion of women
and minority writers happened
given the conditions of the
time...writers didn’t get attention
and this was perpetuated by our
times.”

The English Department's
two-fold proposal has yet to be
approved by Eugenia Gerdes, dean
of arts and sciences. First, the pro-
posal entails changing the course
requirements for the five historical
periods(The Middle Ages, The

junior year.

The idea of a foundations
seminar, however, is not exclusive
to departmental curriculums alone,
and could possibly be incorporated
into the B.A. distributional require-
ments within the College of Arts
and Sciences. Since 1970, the
present distribution . requirements
have been in place. Any future cur-
riculum changes rest with the deans
and the General Education Council.

The distributional require-
ments are “a terribly unsatisfactory
answer,” according to John Ken-
drick, Professor of Sociology. Ken-
drick sits on the General Education
Council, and explained that they are
trying to find “some way to deal
with the distribution requirements.”

Faculty debate plans for incinerator

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

Plans to mobilize opposition
to the hazardous waste incincrator
proposed in Gregg Township con-
tinued to move forward Wednesday
night, with an organizational mcet-
ing for the Organization United for
Ecology’s (OUE) activities in the
Lewisburg area. The meeting
brought between 70 and 80 inter-
ested campus and local citizens to
Dana Engineering’s Gardner Lec-
ture Hall to hear a number of
speakers, including State Rep. Russ

Fairchild, address the range of
safety concerns about the project.
Fairchild, one of the many
local elected officials who have
united against the project,
addressed the political process
involved in stopping the incinera-
tor’s construction. _— Fairchild
explained that between one and
three hazardous waste incinerators
are recommended by the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania’s federally-
mandated plan for hazardous waste
disposal, but that the state “will
have problems selling the concept
of putting this facility in anyone’s

backyard.” He said that recycling
such materials should also be an
important component of eliminat-
ing hazardous waste, but that “we
May never get to zero; however,
that doesn’t mean we keep going
with a policy I don’t think is going
to get us anyplace.” Fairchild said
that one of the major problems with
the hazardous waste plan is “the
ability of the government to usurp
local authority” in the areas of zon-
ing and land use planning, as long
as the developer, in this case
USPCI, goes through a “mcaning-
ful public participation process”

(aatial view: looking nomn)

which, according to Fairchild, has
not been clearly defined. He said
that, in order to stop the incinerator,
“we have to prove the system, as it
exists now, will not work. Can we
stop this thing? I think we can.”

Dr. George Miller, a local
obstetrician active in the American
Academy of Environmental Medi-
cine, explained the health risks of
the incinerator. He said, “There is a
(USPCI) VP sitting their with their
checkbook, waiting for DER to say
“go,” and they will write the check
and the building will go up. [The
key is] looking for the political per-

son who will press the button,
who will say that this site is
unsafe, and Union Pacific will
close their checkbook.”

Miller also noted that
“much information is lacking
on this chemical waste disposal
plant.” Fairchild also attacked
the information process, saying
“the rules and regs are geared
to technical issues; there are a
lot more issues. DER [The
Department of Environmental
Resources] in this state does
not have the best reputation.
They are also undermanned
and underbudgeted.” Noting
safety concerns, Miller con-
cluded, “Obviously, the prior-
ity given by government is to
industry, and not to the local
population.”

Charles Sackrey, asso-
ciate professor of economics,
was one of about half a dozen
faculty and local people who
initiated the meeting to orga-

Couresy of USPCI nize the Lewisburg chapter of

The incinerator sketched above has been furiously debated by faculty and residents who live near the proposed
site.

QUE. He said, “The goal
between now and Christmas is
to get the membership list as
large as possible, and in the

new year to develop new strategies.
The principle way these things are
stopped is politically.” Sackrey said
the goal is to sign up 2,000 mem-
bers in the Lewisburg area, as part
of a overall strategy to enlist
10,000 members in OUE. “If you
establish the fact that you’ve got
10,000 people opposed to the incin-
erator,” Sackrey explained, “that’s
a political reality. The long run
effort will be to bring enough pres-
sure on the politicians that they will
deny the permit” for the facility. He
said there is “something fundamen-
tally wrong” with the political pro-
cess in which one DER official will
make the final decision, saying
“politically it’s | undemocratic.”
Sackrey explained the key to stop-
ping the process is to show “they’re
up against a determined group of
citizens,”

Plans to construct the inciner-
ator were announced in September
by USPCI, Inc., a Houston-based
Subsidiary of the Union Pacific
Corporation. The $100 million haz-
ardous waste incinerator is planned
for a 400-acre site the company
purchased from a developer in
Gregg Township, near the village
of Allenwood in northem Union
County. Company officials faced
stiff opposition in their first public
informational meeting, which drew
national media attention.

Kendrick explained, “Each depart-
ment controls its own courses within
the overall say of the curriculum
committee.” The curriculum com-
mittee appoints the members of the
General Education Council. The
Council is composed of two stu-
dents or faculty from the sciences,
the social sciences, and the Student
Government. A representative of the
writing center, a representative of
the Race/Gender Center, and Dean
Gerdes make up this Council.

“In ‘the ‘future, all students
coming into the curriculum will be
guaranteed a fifteen-person seminar
in their first year,” Kendrick said.
“We're trying to be sensitive to over
1000 students who said they wanted
courses like these [referring to a
petition signed last spring where stu-
dents demanded more courses con-
ceming race, class, and gender].
According to Kendrick, “The notion
that we have to include women’s
works and African-American
authors is a way to include cultural
works that have sort of dropped out
of history—they’ve been forgotten.
We haven’t restructured the curricu-
lum to reflect that we’re rethinking
goals of higher education — we’ve
simply not done that.”

“Evidently, the student body
wants race, class and gender
courses,” said Adrienne Jones,
Director of Multiculture Programs.
Jones added “the courses are at least
offered but I think at least one dis-
tributional requirement should be
non-western...In order to matriculate
through the University, students
must take a non-Western course.”

Intellectual debate about the
curriculum’s focus continues.
According to Karen Dugger, Co-
Director of the Race and Gender
Resource Center, “teaching students
from an inclusive _ perspec-
tive...having a curriculum that is
inclusive is all the rage right now.
As of yet there’s no requirement
anywhere in the University other
than in the History Department, anf
it’s possible for students to go uned-
ucated about race, class, and gender.
A number of our frame of reference
schools and liberal arts colleges —
Colgate, and Dennison, for
instance— already have _ these
requirements.”

Jones said “When I came to
Bucknell, I had to make up for
eighteen years of education I never
had. Maybe the University wants
the students to have a choice. Yet, if
order to complete a well-rounded
education, sometimes it means these
courses must be mandatory. If
you’re not inclusive of all people—
like women who make up one-half
on the society—how are you going
to get back to the core? Exclusion
allows for all the -isms to occur.”

The exclusion of certain
groups, according to Dugger, is
heightened by the increasing demo-
graphic shift within the college pop-
ulation. “What’s predictable and
sad is that this rage is occuring
while the white population is in a
decline and when it’s in self-interest
to start being concerned about diver-
sity.” The population increase of
non-whites between the ages of 18
and 22, has caused “majority group
students to decline and minority
group students to increase in terms
of their presence within educational
institutions.”

According to Timothy Clark,
Acting Director of Minority Student
Development, “the number of stu-
dents going to college is dropping
and more and more péople of color,
Hispanics and Asians are starting to
fill those slots. More and more peo-
ple form different cultures are living
together.. Clark added, “Bucknell is
trying to gear itself to unite the
community.”

Editor’s Note: This is part one of
a two-part series focusing on the
the University’s Arts and Sciences
curriculum.

US and Saudis
discuss military

Following talks between Sec-
retary of State James Baker and
Saudi King Fahd Monday, the
United States and Saudi Arabia
have agreed on a unified military
command structure in the event of
an Iraqi attack.

Baker and Fahd said that an
offensive attack against Iraqi troops
in Kuwait or Iraq would only occur
if both President Bush and the king
agreed before the attack began.

The meeting between the sec-
retary and the king reflected the
continued cooperation between the
Americans and Saudis, as well as
their desire to keep options open in
confronting Iraq during their occu-
pation of Kuwait.

Iraq to release
78 Japanese

Iraq announced Tuesday that
it would release 78 of the 305 Japa-
nese hostages held since the inva-
sion of Kuwait. The release was to
reward former prime minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone for his visit and
negotiations with Iraqi leader Sad-
dam Hussein.

The Nakasone visit reflects a
trend of pilgrimages to Baghdad by
Prominent politicians from nations
allied against Iraq. The visits began
with Austrian president Kurt Wald-
heim, after which 70 Austrian hos-
tages were released.

European leaders have stre-
nously opposed these visits. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Brit-
ain objected to former Prime Minis-
ter Edward Heath’s visit to Bagh-
dad in mid-October. Iraq released
40 British hostages to Heath. For-
mer West German Chancellor
Willy Brandt arrived in Iraq this
week following strong denuncia-
tions from the foreign ministers of
the European Economic Commu-
nity. The ministers are meeting in
Rome to discuss the issue.

US won’t resup-
ply embassy

Despite the failure of a
United Nations’s effort to resupply
the British and American embassies
in Kuwait, the Bush administration
announced that it was unlikely to
use military force to restock the
missions with food and supplies.

A week after President Bush
expressed anger that Iraqi troops
prevented any supplies from enter-

the Bucknellian

ing the compounds and at least one
official spoke of several military
options available to the United
States, administration officials say
that maintaining the embargo
against Iraq was more important
than keeping the embassies open.

A State Department official
said that a failed attempt to resup-
ply the embassies could hand more
hostages to Iraq and provoke an
attack on allied positions in Saudi
Arabia by Iraq.

Muslims declare
peace in Leb.

Two main Shiite Muslim
militias fighting for control of
southem Lebanon signed a peace
agreement in Damascus, Syria,
under the supervision of Iranian
and Syrian officials.

The agreement was an
attempt by the Lebanese govern-
ment to regain control over Leba-
non from militias, which increas-
ingly carved the country into
separate spheres of influence.

The pact may eventually help
the plight of some of the foreign
hostagse believed to be held by fac-
tons loyal to the Party of God, one
of the groups that signed the
agreement.

US ponders new
immigrant plan

A new immigration measure
may become law, the first major
change in American immigration
policy in 25 years. The measure
would increase the number of for-
eign professionals allowed into the
country.

The plan would nearly triple
the number of immigrants allowed
into the United States, from 55,000
to 140,000 per year. The numbers
of total immigrant would rise from
500,000 to 700,000 allowed to
enter each year. The framework
maintains the current emphasis on
reunification of families, while
raising quotas for European and
African immigrants. Regulations
would be relaxed that hamper or
bar Communists, AIDS patients,
and homosexuals from
immigrating.

Businesses, universities, and
research institutions have sup-
ported the plan, because of a fear
that America may fall behind in the
numbers of professionals needed to
keep businesses competitive and
research facilities operating. Some
minority groups have spoken
against the bill by saying that
America should develop the profes-
sional talents of the citizens we
have now.

S&Ls attempt to
evade Fed. laws

Savings and loans across the

nation are trying to get state laws
passed that would allow them to
convert into savings banks. Federal
regulators say this is an attempt to
evade strict new federal guidelines,
while the institutions charge that
the new laws are so onerous that
they cannot do business under
them.

“These efforts are blatant
attempts to evade the reforms
enacted by Congress,” said Timo-
thy Ryan, director of the Office of
Thrift Supervision, which regulates
savings and loans. “I am greatly
disturbed by the growing phenome-
non of S & L’s attempting to cir-
cumvent the requirements of Con-
gress simply by changing the form
of their charter to become state sav-
ings banks.”

Ryan said he fears that
switching from a savings and loan
charter to a state savings bank char-
ter will give institutions the same
freedoms that lead to the Federal
bailout of the savings and loan
industry.

Republicans
minimize losses

Dispite fears by incumbants
that angry voters would return
many officials to private life, few
incumbants were defeated follow-
ing the elections held Tuesday.
Republican fears that they faced
large Democratic gains in gov-
emor’s seats and Congressional
posts were also calmed as losses

were kept at levels common during
mid-term elections.

In Florida, Govemor Bob
Martinez was defeated by former
Democratic Senator Lawton
Chiles, who portrayed himself as a
political outsider and limited al}
contributions to $100 per person,
Anne Richards, behind in the polls
for most of the campaign, defeated
businessman and rancher Clayton
Williams in the Texas gubertorial
race. Williams, the Republican can-
didate, made statements throughout
the campaign that hurt him among
women and alienated many voters,
In both these races, President Bush
campaigned heavily for the Repub-
lican candidates. Republicans held
onto California, as their candidate,
Senator Pete Wilson, defeated for-
mer San Francisco mayor Dianne
Feinstein.

In Congressional _races,
North Carolia Senator Jesse Helms
defeated Harvey Gantt. Gantt, a
black liberal Democrat, showed
surprising strength in pre-election
polls, forcing Helms to stoop to air-
ing campaign commercials that
explicitly dealt with race. Two sur-
prises were the weak victories of
Democratic Senator Bill Bradley of
New Jersey and Representative
Newt Ginrich of Georgia. Both
leading members of Congress were
expected to easily win reelection,
yet both won narrow victories.
Political analysts say that this weak
showing for Bradley, mentioned as
a leading Democratic candidate for
the party’s 1992 presidential cam-

paign, may hurt his chances for
national office.

Incinerator dis-
cussion offered

Clyde Peeling, owner of Rep-
tileland and representative of
Organizations United for the Envi-
ronment, and Anthony Donatoni,
president of United States Pollution
Control Industries (USPCI) of
Pennsylvania, will discuss “Two
Perspectives on the Proposed Incin-
erator” Tuesday, November 20, at 7
Pm. in Vaughan Literature
Auditorium.

The discussion is the second
in a series examining the hazardous
waste incinerator proposed for
Gregg Township.

The discussion, which will be
followed by a question and answer
period, is open to the public.

Peter Awn, professor of

held in Dana room 132, is open to

Univ. pays $1.5
mil settlement

Marquette University has
agreed to an out-of-court settlement
of $1.5 million with a former uni-
versity cheerleader who had filed a
lawsuit after he broke his neck
while performing at a basketball
game.

Joseph de Guzman, the for-
mer cheerleader, fell on his neck
during a 1983 stunt in which he
tried to dive over other cheerlead-
ers and land on a mat. In his law-
suit filed inl986, de Guzman
charged that the university had
been negligent in employing a
cheerleading coach that was
unqualified to judge the safety of
routines he asked cheerleaders to
perform. The trial was scheduled to
begin this week.

The university, in a written
statement, defended its cheerlead-
ing program by saying the accident
“involved unfortunate —_circum-
stances rather than negligence.”
The statement also said that the
decision to settle out-of-court was

because the university’s insurance
company “recognized that a pro-
tracted jury trial would not serve
anyone’s best interest.”

Stanford alters
couples policy

Stanford University has
extended access to campus housing
and other privilidges now enjoyed
by married students to unmarried
couples - homosexual as well as
heterosexual.

The new policy states that
unmarried couples will be eligible
for campus apartments if they are
an “established, long-term domestic
partnership with a mutual commit-
ment similar to that of marriage.”

Non-student spouses of stu-
dents are issued courtesy cards
granting them access to medical
benefits, libraries, and athletic and
recreational facilities. Before the
Policy change, non-student part-
Ners, other than spouses, have been
awarded such privileges on a case-
by-case basis.

Gay and lesbian students at
Stanford have pushed for the
change in university policy since
1976.

if BIO is not satisfied with the
results of the appropriations pro-
cess. Skena said, “If this is a uni-
versity image than the university
should pay for it. If Bucknell wants
good athletic teams they fund them,
they don’t expect student organiza-
tions to fund university missions.”

Skena also defended the
appropriations process, and noted
that “we don’t get food, we don’t
get credit, we don’t get money. The
only compensation we do get is
criticism and an occasional stom-
ach ulcer.... Does he think people

don’t think anyone is making an

Why this disparity? Aren't we strickly an

skin deep?

ner. Security will monitor parties
by making checks once at the
beginning, once in the middle, and
once at the end of a party. He
explained that “those checks will
not involve going into private
rooms or inside into the house.”
Security would venture no further
than the foyer or living room of a
fraternity house, he said.

“T see no reason why you
cannot police your own houses and
control your own activities,”
DeCerchio said. He explained that
unless groups request the help of
security or unless the party gets out
of control, “you won’t see the type
of petty enforcement that you’ve
experienced in the past.”

When one student asked
whose laws, the university’s or the
state’s, will be followed, Sojka
responded by saying that university
policy must remain within state
law.

“T mentioned and I will con-
tinue to mention publicly that I
think Pennsylvania Act 31 has not
improved the lives of college stu-
dents and I think it has signifi-
cantly impacted in a not-positive
way the lives of the people who
live around Pennsylvania col-
leges,” Sojka said.

The committee which
DeCerchio spoke of will work on
revising university within the per-
ameters of Act 31. “There’s a lati-
tude for my interpretation and my
implementation of policies and pro-
cedures and | intend to utilize stu-
dent imput. You will work with me
in that process,” said DeCerchio,

said Sojka, pointing out student

a difficult situation.”

Sojka also noted that “stu-

people were going to listen to

In addition to fielding more
students’ questions, the administra-
tors asked students what steps to
follow next. According to Sojka,
administrators are willing to work
with students to create a reasonable
policy, which will still comply with
Act 31.

“We've got to work through

we're going to come out with a

Sojka.

life as NYC detective

The Bucknellian

Security and Safety Captain discusses 21 years with NYC police dept.

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

“Lewisburg is boring! Noth-
ing exciting ever happens here!”
This is a common refrain among
some Bucknell students; Lewis-
burg’s tranquility, however, suits
Security and Safety Captain Mike
Amarante just fine. Amarante, who
served 21 years in the New York
City Police Department, retired in
1975 as a Detective First Grade and
came to Bucknell because “my
time wasn’t my own..., my kids
were growing up without me [and]
we always loved the country.”
Since he traded the danger on the
streets of his native Brooklyn for
the calm of his eight-acre farm in
the West Branch valley, Amarante
has hardly looked back. While on
the force, Amarante never had to
look back, because he always
seemed to be a step ahead of the
criminals.

“A street crime cop from the
beginning,” Amarante began build-
ing his reputation in 1954; “crime
went down tremendously” when he
hit the streets as a rookie patrol-
man, and his 44 rookie arrests
earned him promotion to detective
after less than two years on the
force.

Throughout his career, Ama-
rante made close to 500 robbery
arrests, but only had one trial—
everyone else “pleaded guilty.
They were all caught in the act.”
Since he left the city, however, life
is no safer for muggers and street
thiefs, because Amarante helped
train the Force’s original street
crimes unit, which incorporated the
methods Amarante and his partner
used “because we were so
effective.”

It was “an ability to spot
criminals before they do a crime”
that made Amarante a great street
cop, but where does such ability
come from? While admitting that
“you've got to have a feel, a second
nature,” he said it also was “a
knowledge of the streets, a knowl-
edge of Brooklyn, and a knowledge
of crime.” As a_ self-described
“tough street kid” growing up as

one of ten children, he “was street-
wise already,” explaining his
astounding rookie record.
Amarante and his partner
would spot a potential criminal and
then trail him for anywhere from
several minutes to several hours.
The key, he says, is “to try to get
close to your prey, but never let

were afraid you were dead. You
learn to act and react; you had to be
careful and do everything smartly.”
The key, he said, is “always to
make sure you have the upper
hand, [and] take them without vio-
lence if possible.” For instance,
Amarante explained that, in an
armed robbery of a neighborhood

mendation for his outstanding work with the New York City Police

Department.

them see you; if you have to, be in
a disguise.” Amarante would use
hats, glasses, blankets and almost
anything else to avoid being seen.
Just as in many television police
shows, that old man walking down
the street with a limp might really
have been Detective Amarante.
How do you face danger on
the streets, from any direction at
any time, every day for 21 years?
Amarante explained, “You weren’t
afraid, you were cautious. If you

store, the first instinct would be to
charge in while the crime was in
progress, but the smart officer
would wait until the criminal
entered the street and put his gun
away. Looking back on his career,
Amarante says he “thanks God I
wasn’t killed. I also never killed
anyone—I’m proud of that.”
Amarante earned 53 depart-
mental citations and civic awards
and letters of commendation from
police commissioners, FBI Direc-

tors and Supreme Court justices,
but he continued to face the danger
because he “enjoyed saving people.
You felt good about yourself, and it
gave you the inspiration to go out
again.” One of Amarante’s cita-
tions came when, while off-duty,
he pushed his way through on-
lookers to dash into a buming
house and save a baby trapped
inside, sustaining burns himself in
the process. He especially “always
enjoyed apprehending for mug-
gings of old people,” and used to
work extra hours to do so “because
you’ve seen the victims of muggers
not caught.”

“Although you do miss being
who you were,” he said, “you don’t
miss the brutality you saw, and the
crimes against people.” When
Amarante left the force he had a
year in which he could return to his
former job, and he said “It took me
quite a while [deciding] over
whether to go back.” In the end,
Amarante said, “It was the students
that kept me here.” He feels the key
to his good rapport with students is
that “they respected me because I
respected them.”

During his fifteen years at
Bucknell those students have
included two of his four children.
His daughter Collette graduated in
1988 with an education degree, and
his son Greg is currently a fresh-
man. Over the years he has enjoyed
working with students and having
his children’s friends over to the
farm for a home-cooked Italian
meal. Amarante especially looks
forward to Homecoming and “see-
ing most of my students,” who
return as alumni with their own
children. (One of those kids is
named Michael, for a certain Secur-
ity officer.)

Like many other members of
the Bucknell community, he has
noticed that it has become more dif-
ficult to keep a close relationship
with students in recent years. Ama-
rante says, “You have to try to
reach out [to the students] with
Tespect and keep it. You watch over
them like you watch over your own
children.”

Dear Readers:

Here’s a little pep talk for
everyone trying to snag a for-
mals date:

Formals are a perfect time
to let that boxmate or lab partner
know that you’re interested. If
you feel comfortable with the
person and receive positive
vibes, go for it! You have noth-
ing to lose, and everything to
gain. Most people are really flat-
tered by an invitation to a date
function.

An important key to ask-
ing the right person to formals is
to be honest with yourself. Don’t
ask someone you don’t like, just
because he or she is in the right
Greek organization. Also, don’t
be pressured by your friends.
Remember, it’s your date, and
you shouldn’t base who you ask
on who your friends think you
should ask.

If the thought of rejection
mortifies you, find a common
friend who can test the ground
for you. If you ask the person on
your own, make sure you ask in
a way that makes the person feel
comfortable saying no. If you
corer the person into saying
‘yes,’ the formals will end up
being uncomfortable. A good
idea is to say, “ If you’re not
busy on (date), I
was wondering if you’d like to
go to formals with me.” This
gives the person an easier oppr-
tunity to decline or at least think
about it (i.e. “ I have to check
my calendar”), and lets you
know that the ‘yes’ answer is
sincere.

Here are the top ten tips on
popping that question:

10. brush and floss for that
winning smile

9. add a mild cologne or
perfume

8. don’t fidget (ie, shuf-
fling your feet, twirling your
hair)

7. use flattery (i.e. “ You
are a terrific dancer; I’d love to
go with you to formals.”)

6. bribery works, too ( i.e.
Dinner and dessert are
included.”)

November 9, 1990

5. white lies (ic. “We
haven’t decided whether our
band is going to be Acrosmith or
Pink Floyd.”)

4. be casual; you’re not
proposing marriage

3. don’t play it too cool,
they will think you don’t care
one way or the other

2. wear fairly neat clothes
(not your oldest and
grungiest)

1, JUST DO IT - good
luck in your quest for the Holy
Formals Date, have a blast.

Dear Wanda,

I want to go abroad for a
semester but I don’t want to
leave my boyfriend for that
long.

Frightened,
Confused, and Disillusioned

Dear F, C, and D,

You may be basing your
decision on the wrong factors.
Your boyfriend may have tried
to convince you not to go
abroad. It’s nice that he wants to
spend time with you, but it is
your life. You can’t let your life
revolve entirely around him; do
not give up this fantastic oppor-
tunity for someone else, You can
survive without him for a few
months - you can even write to
each other every day if you want
to. Going abroad is something
you have to do for yourself. This
may be the only chance you
have to live abroad without pay-
ing extraordinary amounts of
money for living expenses. Take
advantage of what you are being
offered. It is up to you and your
boyfriend to decide how to han-
dle it. You can leave it open to
see other people, or just have a
temporary long-distance rela-
tionship. Do not assume that he
will fall in love with someone
else while you’re gone. If you’re
committed to each other it can
work.

Send your problems and
concerns to:

Rockin’ the airwaves on WVBU

By Sean Grass
Staff Writer

Located in five main rooms
in the depths of the Carnegie Build-
ing’s basement is a campus organi-
zation that most Bucknellians know
of, but who most know little about.
This organization is the radio voice
of Bucknell University, 90.5
WVBU FM.

The radio station functions
through the efforts of the approxi-
mately eighty students who volun-
teer as disc-jockeys at the station.
Eight of these eighty disc-jockeys
(or jocks as they prefer to be
called) comprise the _ station’s
Board of Directors, the group that
is responsible for the administrative
aspects of the station. These eight
positions are laid out in the sta-
tion’s by-laws and constitution.
The positions are elected offices,
and the term is from January to Jan-
uary, spanning one semester each
of two separate school years.

This year’s Board of Direc-
tors consists of the following peo-
ple: Evan Lippman, ‘91, Station
Manager; Colin Bridgewater, ‘92,
Program Director; John Devecka,
‘91, Music Director; Gene Toombs,
“92, Business Manager; Toby Basi-
liko, ‘91, Chief Engineer; and Matt
Wood, ‘92, Operations Manager.
The other two board positions,
those of Sales Director and Senior
Advisor, are vacant at this time.

Also involved in the manage-
ment of WVBU is a group of six
persons known as the Support
Staff. Only one of the positons on
this staff is filled at this time—
Craig Bitter, ‘93, is currently the
Promotions Manager. The Faculty
Advisor for the station is Catherine
Blair of the Writing Center.

So now you know who runs
the station, but how does WVBU
really operate?

At the beginning of each
semester, a meeting is held for all

jocks at WVBU. This meeting is to
allow each jock to select the day
and time for his or her show for
that semester. The shows run on a
weekly basis and run in length from
1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours. The jocks pick
in order of their seniority in work-
ing with the station. Because of
this, freshmen normally get the
worst shifts, but the system looks
increasingly more equitable as you
gain seniority with the station. This
meeting to determine “show picks”

is normally held within the first
three wecks of the semester.

Of course, not just anyone
can get a show on WVBU—at least
not right away. People who are
interested in becoming a disc-
jockey must go through a series of
training steps in order to become
qualified for a shift on the air. A
prospective jock must first display
knowledge of how to operate the
bewildering array of buttons,
knobs, and switches on the control
room board in the studio by passing
a practical board exam. Then the
Prospective jock must make an
audition tape, or a “demo,” simulat-
ing an hour-long show on the air.
Once this tape is approved by the
Board, the prospective jock will be

WVBU range from jazz to reggae
to hard rock. Currently, though, the
shows on WVBU are mainly split
up between classic rock and pro-
gressive music. Specialty shows,
such as Heavy Metal, Sounds of the
City, and Bucknell Top 10 can also
be found in various time slots
throughout the week. The station
also airs a special Prisoner Request
show in which requests are taken in
letter form from inmates at the
Lewisburg Penitentiary.

What is it that allows for such
a diversity of music to be found on
WVBU? Undoubtedly it is the
enormous collection of records.
The station has an entire room that
is devoted to the storage of albums,
as well as some forty-five’s. Some

asked to sit in on three shows that
are run by a Board member, as an
observation experience. After that
there is nothing left to do but apply
to the Federal Communications
Commission for a radio operator’s
license. The new jock is ready to
start rocking the airwaves.

One unusual feature of
WVBU is that jocks are permitted
to choose the kind of music they
would like to play during their
shift. For this reason, shows on

of these date back to as many as
twenty years.

According to Greg Williams,
‘92, a former Sales Director with
the station, “a quick estimate” of
the number of albums in the music
library gave him a count of “about
20,000 albums.” These albums
have been accumulating since the
forming of the station back in 1965,
and more come all of the time from
groups to which WVBU subscribes
for new music.

Additionally, WVBU now
has two compact disc players—one
has been bought in each of the past
two years. Along with these CD-
players, the station receives com-
pact discs in much the same way as
it receives albums, through sub-
scriptions. In the year since WVBU
acquired its first CD player, the sta-
tion has “upwards of 200, maybe
300 discs,” Williams said.

The purchasing of all of these
new discs and albums requires
money, however, and the station is
run as a non-profit organization.
WVBU does very little advertising,
with the exception of its fund-
raising Spring Marathon Weekend,
normally held in May. The station
also sends jocks to do remotes at
dances and parties, and Williams
said that “this does pull in quite a
few bucks.” Also, subscribing to
groups for new music helps to keep
costs low; the station rarely buys
new music outright.

Nevertheless, the fact
remains that costs are numerous,
and WVBU’s only large source of
funding is the Bucknell Student
Government. Each year, BSG
appropriates money to the radio sta-
tion to keep it going.

“In ball park figures,” accord-
ing to Williams, “the station got
$18,000 last year.” He added that
the station expects around $14,400
this year, a considerably smaller
allotment.

The funds, while seeming
large for a station run by volun-
teers, are nevertheless chewed up
quickly. The F.C.C. requires that
WVBU subscribe to the Associated
Press news wire. The fee for the
service is $5200 annually, nearly
one-third of the station’s funding.
WVBU also receives such music
publications as Rolling Stone and
the College Music Journal. Add to
these costs those of maintenance,
new equipment, and new music,
and it is obvious where the funding
for the station vanishes.

Even so, WVBU is celebrat-
ing its twenty-fifth anniversary this
year. The station keeps churning
day after day, rocking the Lewis-
burg area at a frequency of 90.5
mega-hertz under the call letters
WVBU. With its musical diversity
as well as the commitment of the
students who volunteer to work
there year in and year out, the sta-
tion should continue to last for a
long long time.

How does Bucknell stack up
in the college guide books?

By Susan Elolampi
Staff Writer

Rumors have been circulating
around campus that Bucknell is fall-
ing in the college ratings game.
These seem to have started after the
release of The U.S. News and World
Report “College Guide” for 1991
(October 15, 1990) which rated
Bucknell in the top quartile for
National Liberal Arts Colleges.
Bucknell was not mentioned in The
U.S. News and World Report “Col-
lege Guide” for 1990. And Buck-
nell was rated as number 24 in the
top 25 National Liberal Arts Col-
leges in the previous year’s issue,
October 10, 1988.

However, in some of the col-
lege guides, such as The Insider's
Guide to Colleges, compiled and
edited by the staff of The Yale
Daily News, and The Fiske Guide to
Colleges by Edward B. Fiske, Edu-
cation Columnist for The New York
Times, Bucknell’s rating has.
remained constant for the last few
years. For example, in The Fiske

Guide to Colleges for both 1989
and 1991, academics and social life
continue to have a four out of five
star rating and the quality of life
continues to have a three star rating
(five stars representing the best
level).

It seems, though, that where
the concern has come is where
Bucknell was rated as “highly
competitve” or “very difficult” in
1989. But, in some of the 1991 col-
lege guides such as Peterson's Four
Year Colleges guide, Bucknell is
listed as being “very difficult” or
“very competitive.”

Director of Admissions Mark
Davies points out that the catego-
ries in the rating system, especially
those of U.S. News and World
Report, change every year. “Buck-
nell’s basis for choosing possible
candidates has remained the same.”

“Profiles for classes of the
last ten years show that the kind of
student we’re admitting to Bucknell
hasn’t changed,” he explains. “I
don’t think our competitors’ pro-
files have changed either so that

they are dealing with the same qual-
ity students that we are.”

He also points out that col-
leges are looking at smaller num-
bers of high school seniors in the
next few years so that will leave
more opportunities for graduating
high school students that are not
currently available to them. How-
ever, that shouldn’t change the qual-
ity of education.

Most college guides tend to
point out the negatives. For exam-
ple, The Insider's Guide to Colleges
(1990) warns prospective students
to choose their English professors
carefully and refer to a weak sociol-
Ogy program and unpopular per-
forming and visual arts programs at
Bucknell.

College guides also put labels
on schools, such as The Insider's
Guide to Colleges (1989) that calls
Bucknell “the country club on the
Susquehana” and Bucknell students
“‘preprofessionals” and “future yup-
pies.” In addition to labels, they
also make generalizations such as
“Bucknell is probably not the right

place for a free-floating spirit seek-
ing inner discovery,” as written in
The Fiske Guide to Colleges
(1991).

Also, people tend to want to
hear that the school they have cho-
sen is better than another school.
Mr. Davies agrees, “Financially,
they deserve to hear accurate infor-
mation because they are making a
big investment in their future. But,
they also deserve to know the posi-
tives as well as the negatives.”

Essentially, the goal of the
publishers of these guides is to sell
books. The college guides defend
themselves by saying that they’re
being fair because they talk to the
students. But, these sources of
information could be as few as one
or two students, which is a very
narrow view of what is actually
happening. And, as Mr. Davies
points out, “We as the public are
playing right into their hands
because we want simple answers to
hard questions.”

Let’s Do Lunch

With Julie Bachman and Steve Hoerter
Staff Writers

Perkin's Family Restaurant

Rt. 15 across from Shorty's
Open 24 hours a day

If you look up in the sky towards town at night you can sce a
beacon of light shining up towards the stars. If you were to follow its
signal you'd find yourself on Rt. 15, proudly standing underneath a
huge American flag all aglow — in the driveway of Perkin's Family
Restaurant.

We were seated by the hostest (with the mostest) and presented
with a colorful array of menu choices for lunch. Julie chose the Chef
Salad ($5.29...nice round figure) mainly because of the menu
description:

"Lean ham, turkey, plus American and Monterey Jack cheese
piled on a bed of fresh salad greens garnished with fresh, crisp vege-
tables. Served in a munchy bowl of our own fresh baked French
bread." It was the munchy bow! that so intrigued Julie. |

Julie also dined on a cup of the cream of potato soup ($1.10),
which she found to be a tad bit salty, but of a very creamy consis-
tency. She found the Chef Salad to be hearty, with generous portions
of meat and cheese. The munchy bowl was an interesting con-
cept...but was a bit too tough to handle.

Steve sampled the turkey club croissant ($4.95), which was
voraciously recommended by Arla, our waitress. Steve found the
sandwich to be an extremely tasty treat. The french fries, which were
included with the sandwich, were lacking in quantity, but were quite
tantalizing.

For dessert, Julie tried the "Incredible Croissant Sundae"
($1.99). She found the sundae to be a sweet-tooth junky's dream.
Steve had the chocolate eclair ($1.25), and found it to be a creamy |
treat.

The ambience of Perkin's is quite nice — although some of the |
employees could use a nice, long, soapy shower, and a keg of Arrid
Extra Dry.

Perkin's boasts a fine, in-house bakery with selections ranging
from carrot cake, muffins, breads, cookies and birthday cakes. Every-
thing looked QUITE yummy.

Overall, Perkin's is a pleasurable dining establishment.
Although we prefer non-franchise oriented establishments, Perkin's is
an excellent dining alternative in the Lewisburg metro area.

Julie and Steve give Perkin's three and one-half bison (on a
scale of one to five.)

With the first open forum, in what we hope will continue to be an open and aggressive restructuring pro-

Associate Editor

We’re finally on our way to achieving changes that students have deserved for almost two years. We hope
that this process is not simply a reaction, but a realization of the injustices and blatant disregard for equitable jus-
tice that have been imposed upon our community in recent months.

Appropriations

The conclusion of the appropriations process for Bucknell Student Government (BSG) for this academic

year has almost come to a close. With its conclusion new questions are being raised as to the equity of the dis-

bursement and the amount of funding available for student organizations.

While Bill Lee, president of the Bucknell International Organization (BIO), argues for special attention due
to the nature of the organization he represents, there are more important issues at hand.

With an increasing number of student organizations requesting funds from BSG and a static amount of

funding, the appropriations committee is faced with a difficult task.

PUBLISHING POLICY
The editorial content of The Bucknellian does not necessarily reflect the opinions and attitudes of Bucknell

Clearly, there is a need for an increase in student organization funding. Whether this comes from an
increase in the Activities fee, or from the coffers of the University, is open for debate.

This issue aside, there is an urgent need for the BSG appropriations committee to publish more detailed

guidelines for the appropriations process.

Student organizations are mystified by the entire process and feel budget slashing occurs in a haphazard

and subjective manner. Published guidelines must be made available not only to demystify the process, but also
to aid student organization treasurers in drawing up budget proposals.

As the University pushes for alternatives to the Greek system, it must be willing to back its rhetoric with
funding. Now is the time for the Trustees to act — allocate more funds for student organizations.

Those who sit on the appropriations committee possess a great deal of power; we can only hope that this
power is used wisely and that the appropriations process is indeed fair and equitable.

BAC responds to student complaints
about lack of scheduled events

To the Editor:

We are writing in response to
the Freshman Forum article written
by Jim Joseph in the November 2
issue of The Bucknellian. The article
made the valid point that “there must
be some sort of activity planned for
freshmen when there is no alternative
recreation.” The Bucknell Activities
Council (BAC) agrees, and would go
further to say there should be activi-
ties available for everyone on cam-
pus, not only freshmen. However, it
is acommon misconception by Buck-
nell students that BAC is capable of
providing many campus activities
and is simply not doing so. We have
already sponsored Christy’s, comedi-
ans, musical acts, Bison Express
trips, and movies nearly every
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday
night.

Why did we not have anything

scheduled on Homecoming Week-
end? The Office of Annual Giving
had every public room on campus
reserved so that no other events
could be planned. It is their method
of insuring that people go to the
events that they have scheduled; the
same practice is used by the Parents’
Weekend Committee. It just so hap-
pens that the only event open to the
public Saturday night was at the
Weis Center. BAC did co-sponsor
the Dessert Theatre that was held in
the Terrace Room on Friday night.
Why have we not done more
for students? One of the reasons is a
simple lack of peoplepower. BAC is
run by students for students. There
are other programming boards on
campus, but we are one of the few to
use all campus facilities on a regular
basis. At the present time, we have a
total of 70 members, approximately
30 of which are active in planning

events for a campus of 3300. If you
care to figure out a percentage, it is
less than 1% of the students pro-
gramming for the whole campus.
Fortunately, these students are vol-
untarily committing many hours of
their free time to try to enhance the
campus social life.

We are not required, by the
administration or BSG, to provide a
social outlet for the entire campus
all of the time. Considering the
resources we have, this is nearly
impossible for us to do. It is also
impossible for us to provide “big-
name” concerts, such as Little Feat
which cost $34,000, when our bud-
get is $30,000 per year. Even a little
known entertainer, such as Alex
Cole, who was on cam-
pus November 2, costs $1500 per
hour. It is unfair for you to expect
us to always be responsible for your
weckend entertainment. The only
way to remedy this situation is for
more students to get involved. In
order to know what you want and to
be able to provide it for you, we
need your opinion and
involvement.

It is a belief of many Bucknel-
lians that the social scene centers
around alcoholic parties, often at fra-
ternity houses. Although that may be
the case, the potential for non-greck
student organization programming is
great. Realize that BAC is only per-
mitted to plan non-alcoholic events-
because we are funded by the Uni-
versity. Everyone is welcome to
attend or help organize our events;
we do not distinguish between fresh-
men and upperclassmen, greeks and
non-greeks. But this potential for
programming will never be realized
until those of you who find the
present situation lacking get
involved. I invite Jim Joseph, along
with the rest of the Bucknell campus
community to attend our next open
meeting on November 15 at 6 pm in
room 219 of the Langone Center.
You have two options: sit back and
complain about the social situation
or get involved and try to change it.

Junior encourages
student activism

To the Editor:

The “Halloween Riot,” Buck-
nell’s excitement for the year has
been compared to the social move-
ments of the 1960s. Students are say-
ing, “Look, we are not apathetic, we
stand up for what we believe in!”

Unfortunately that cause, that
belief is rooted in alcohol: the free-
dom to get drunk, to throw up, and ©
wake up the next morning with a
hangover. As a member of suppos-
edly “liberal” groups on campus, I
am glad to see Bucknell unite. It is

hopeful that we are not an apathetic
generation. But if you looked
around, you would see that Amnesty
International, FLAG, Reaction,
SAMS, APO, etc. are giving you
many reasons to become involved.
No matter how much we fight
it, underage drinking is against the
law; human rights are not. So, Buck-
nell, please use this energy, use this
emotion to work for a greater good!

Freshman Forum

By Richard Polt

“The Halloween night riots.” “The Halloween night mas-
sacre.” ““Wednesday Bloody Wednesday.” These are all names
for what might have transpired this past October 31st; luckily
things didn’t go that far. Thanks to the deft actions of certain
individuals this Halloween will go down in Bucknell history as
“the night President Sojka had his own theme party.” And
what a party it was: kegs at the U.C. and quad, hundreds of
people crowding the streets and even...yes even reporters to
preserve the epic soiree. So what was the theme?

The themes, as we’ve heard all too many times, are the
ramifications of administrative drinking policies on campus
social life. Although these issues concern me greatly, my wor-
ries lie in a different area. The social reforms we strive to
attain do not justify the methods in which we go about getting
them. Our rally which we hoped would be a reflection upon
the debatable governing of our administration turned out to be
a mockery of ourselves. This was apparent by the way the
news reported and almost exploited the impromptu protest. I
saw telecasts depicting a school where the students’ number
one priority was drinking. As if the only issue for which we
would unify as an entire student body and face the threat of
water hoses and dogs was for beer. Every news clip from the
night showed people, my friends, drinking alcohol from cups
and cans.

From our perspective, it was something that just hap-
pened. The explosion of bottled-up feelings turned into a phys-
ical display of protest. From “Joe T.V. Viewer” ‘s angle, how-
ever, it was a bunch of kids who needed to get their act
together. Even my father reacted with tentativeness towards
the validity of our plight: “of course we protested when I was
your age, but for causes that had social significance.”

As I watched the television reports I almost laughed at
the sheer stupidity of the entire situation. I didn’t laugh
though; I couldn’t laugh. Why wasn’t it my face on the televi-
sion set? I stood alongside 1,000 other students, eager to see
what would happen next. I was responsible for the rally just as
much as any other student at Bucknell. Being a freshman, I
knew of the stringent drinking policies at this school while
applying last year. Obviously this knowledge didn’t affect my
final decision. Perhaps I am not bothered by the current drink-
ing regulations because they have been around as long as I
have. In other words, I have no frame of reference to compare
things with as do the upperclassmen. Nevertheless, I stood
alongside them last Wednesday night, not sure why.

Of course what really matters is not how others perceive
what happened here, but how we do. If we understand why we
protested and what we protested for, we are closer to solving
the various problems which exist presently. If, however, the
administration and students don’t come to any substantial
agreements, things might not end up as quictly as they did on
Halloween.

By Greg Adams

USPCI, a subsidiary of Union
Pacific, is applying for a permit to
operate a hazardous waste incinera-
tor in Allenwood. Many in our Val-
ley fear such an incinerator, partic-
ularly in light of problems
experienced by other communities.
Others rightly criticize the sort of
knee jerk “not in my backyard”
reaction which accompanies every
attempt at siting such a facility.

I am currently opposed to the
siting and would like to ofier my
reasons. I lay no claim to being a
technical expert, and freely admit
to being predjudiced by my fears of
having a hazardous waste incinera-
tor within three miles of my home.
I offer here an initial attempt to
come to terms with some of the
issues involved in a_ rational
fashion.

USPCI is applying under a
1988 law which — effectively
removes local veto power over
such a siting. The law was enacted
in order that Pennsylvania, a large
producer of toxic wastes, could be
able to take care of its own waste
products in state.

Although there is no univer-
sal agreement, many _ groups,
including some environmental
groups, believe mcineration is a
responsible way to dispose of cer-
tain toxic wastes. It is to be
expected that a toxic waste inciner-
ator will be sited somewhere in
Pennsylvania in the next 5 years,
and the question to be decided is
where it should go.

I believe there are many valid
reasons for not siting the incinera-
tor in Allenwood. My first concern
involves the emissions from the
incinerator. The theory of incinera-
tion is that all organic materials are
converted into carbon dioxide and
water as combustion products.

Unfortunately, the process is
much more complicated than this.
For example, hazardous wastes
contain many components which
are inorganic, such as heavy metals
or sulfur compounds. Moreover,
even at very high temperatures,
only a proportion, albeit an exceed-
ingly high proportion, of the
organic materials can be com-
pletely burned.

The EPA and DER (Depart-
ment of Environmental Resources
of Pennsylvania) require that the
net destruction of organic materials
be at least 99.99 percent for certain
organic materials and 99.9999 per-
cent for certain very dangerous
materials such as PCB’s. These per-
centages are verified by test burns
performed under ideal conditions.

I suspect that under normal
conditions the efficiency of the
incinerator would drop. Moreover,
in order that the incinerator operate
at near peak efficiency, it is neces-
sary that its operation be carefully
planned and managed.

Even accepting an incinerator
operating at peak efficiency, the “6
nines” and “4 nines” destruction
percentages allow for a certain
amount of toxic gases. Certain
materials which can be expected to
be in the emissions can pose a
health threat even at very low con-
centrations. For example, the
amount of toxic material (PCB)
spread in the Seveso disaster of
1976 was approximately 10
pounds.

Other combustion products
can be extremely dangerous. One
such example is dioxins. Although
it is very difficult to find direct evi-
dence, dioxins are suspected to
have very potent effects on human
beings in concentrations of a few
parts per trillion.

(Direct evidence is hard to
come by in that dioxins rarely
occur apart from other suspected
agents, but experiments on rodents
and monkeys point towards the pru-
dence of great caution in dealing
with dioxins.) Dioxins become
more concentrated as they pass
through the food chain into beef,
cows’ milk and therefore eventu-
ally back to us.

Another product in the com-

bustion emissions will be heavy
metals which have been implicated
in being carcinogenic. These, too,
can travel up the food chain to
reach higher animals and human
beings.

The chemistry involved in
incineration seems to be quite com-
plicated and not necessarily well
understood given the complex and
not completely known input materi-
als. While one
might be able to
predict quite
well the compo-
sition of most of
the emissions,
the ability to
predict every-
thing released is
impossible. As
an example, ina
1986 report by
Dow Chemical
Corporation, it
was reported
that their scien-
tists could find
no relationship
between varia-
bles such as
temperatures, /
feed rates, and
pollution con-
trol devices and
the emissions of
dioxins in one
of their inciner-
ators. Even
voices from
within the EPA
have suggested
that the knowledge as to the emis-
sions from incinerators is not well
enough known to justify siting
incinerators near humans.

This incinerator would be
located within a mile upwind of
many homes as well as within two
miles of the villages of Allenwood
and Dewart. The outskirts of Wat-
sontown are three miles downwind
of the site, and following Watson-
town there are several communities
which can be considered downwind
of the site.

Moreover, there is much
farmland within a few miles of the
site. Thus, there is the worry of
both airborne toxins as well as a
gradual contamination of important
farmland.

I think that one can make the
case that such facilities should not
be placed very close to human com-
munities, and in our case this worry
is magnified by the particular geog-
raphy of our Valley. We have very
dense fogs which occur with fre-
quent regularity.

Fog is known to be an effi-
cient scavenger of organic materi-
als. The presence of fog can
increase the concentrations of some
gases over a thousand times their
usual equilibrium values. Moreo-
ver, the weather of the Valley is
such that one would have to fear
that the emissions could become
concentrated in the Valley rather
than dispersing. In Broome County,
New York, similar concerns have
Icad the state of New York to seri-
ously consider a three year mora-
torium in a similar siting case so
that accurate site specific weather
data could be gathered.

My second concern is an eco-
logical one. USCPI intends to
create an above-ground landfill to
store the ash from the incinerator.
This ash contains components very
toxic to the environment. The
present plans are to bake the ash
into cement bricks which are to be
stored in an above-ground sand-
wich of plastics and covered with
dirt. The plastic is intended to pre-
vent water from reaching the bricks
and thereby allowing the toxic
wastes to leach out into the ground
water and nearby streams.

The problem with this landfill
is its close proximity to the Susque-
hanna river. Not only is the river an
important source of drinking water,
but it also feeds the Chesapeake
Bay. Short term, the bricks will not
pose much of a threat to the envi-
ronment. Long term however, there
is a strong chance that the bricks
will leach out and damage the river.

Moreover, the daily operation
of the incinerator would require the
transfer and storage of dangerous
matcrials from the shore of the
river where the rail lines run, to the
site of the incinerator a half-mile
away. This would seem to be to be
a real point of danger with great
potential for a serious accident.

My third concern relates to
the long-term development of the

Valley. There is much farming,
and, relatively little heavy industry.
The “cultural” attractions of this
area are few compared to a more
urban area. Still, as the slogan goes,
“It’s a great place to live”. In fact,
many people have chosen to settle
or retire here because of a con-
scious choice to elect such a life
style. Many have worked very hard
to develop this area in such a way
that its character is not greatly
altered.

Siting a hazardous waste
incinerator in Allenwood would
have negative developmental and
economic consequences for the
area, and indeed many local gov-
emmental bodies have for this rea-
son voiced opposition to the siting.
These bodies are frustrated that the
area was forced to accept a landfill
and a large prison complex against
its will and question being forced to
accept yet another negative
development.

Even a public perception of
possible contamination of farm-
lands would have a devastating
impact on the local agricultural
industry. Moreover, an incinerator
of this nature would assuredly
inhibit the ability of local commu-
nities to direct development of the
region by discouraging desirable
industries and encouraging less
desirable industries from settling in
the Valley. There seems to be a
basic question as to what extent,
local communities should be able
to determine their own futures.

The emotionalism of the
community reaction to the siting
proposal has also been criticized. |
would like to make a few com-
ments to this point which I feel are
relevant.

The state legislation which
mandates the siting of an incinera-
tor calls for “meaningful public
participation” in the siting process.
Unfortunately, very few clues are
given as to how this participation
will be taken into account.

The public has a healthy dis-
trust of the objectivity of DER both
because of the many former power-
ful politicians involved financially
in this siting as well as because of
past experience with DER. When
the Lycoming landfill was pro-
posed, people tried to inform them-
selves as to its pros and cons. Being
ultimately convinced that it was a
bad idea, opponents attempted to
fight it on technical grounds before
the jury of DER. Respected experts
from Penn State spoke against the
wisdom of locating it at its present
site.

When their opinions were
rejected, the local people then mon-
itored the landfill and made reports
to DER. These reports included
descriptions as to the strong likeli-
hood that its liner was damaged
during construction. Two years
later, these reports were followed
by evidence that in fact leaching
had already begun to occur. DER
did not respond to these reports.

Now that DER is again being asked
to judge a controversial siting, it
should come as no surprise that
many do not believe that a fair
hearing will be made.

Moreover, a decision by the
local community to accept the new
siting would require a certain
amount of trust in USPCI. At this
point, I do not believe that such
trust has been earned.

According to news accounts,
the land obtained for the incinerator
was said to be acquired under the
pretense of being intended only for
“light industries” by Pennswood
Development Corporation. Moreo-

ver, some people involved in the
transaction suspect now that Penns-
wood was acting secretly as an
agent for USPCI.

Part of this belief is based on
the fact that negotiations by Union
Pacific to buy the needed rail con-
nections occurred even before
negotiations by Pennswood to pur-
chase the land for the incinerator.
Given the apparent previous lack of

interest in these
lines, one wonders
what prompted the
interest if not to
connect with the
planned _incinera-
tor. This seems to
be the basis for the
general distrust of
USPCI by local
people.

I am also
disturbed that vir-
tually no data has
been presented by
USPCI as
exactly what can
be expected from
their incinerator.
In fact, any data
which has_ been
presented has been
“sugar coated”.

At a Wat-
sontown Area
Business Associa-
tion meeting, the
company represen-
tative was quoted
as having
answered a ques-

tion as to the emissions by naming
only the harmless components of
the emissions and then by adding
that small amounts of carbon mon-
oxide would also be emitted. Pro-
fessor LaGrega supplemented this
list with some of those things men-
tioned above. This seems typical to
me of the way that USPCI has been
presenting its case to our
community.

Those of us who are attempt-
ing to evaluate USPCI’s proposal
from a technical perspective are
frustrated by the lack of detailed
data being provided. Given the
many variables involved here, and

the length of time necessary to
understand the implications of a
particular incinerator plan, this lack
of details makes it impossible to
critique the siting on  scicntific
grounds. It would scem that pru-
dence would dictate opposition
until enough details are known to
convince one of the ultimate safety
of this particular incinerator.

Summing up, I feel that the
proximity of this incinerator to
local communities and farmland,
and its proximity to the river make
the Allenwood location highly
questionable. Moreover, the partic-
ular geography of the region tends
to exacerbate the dangers posed by
this proximity. I am also disturbed
by the possible negative impact on
the quality of life in our Valley that
this siting might imply.

Finally, I am also disturbed
by the apparent disdain on the part
of USPCI for the opinions of the
communities which would have to
host this incinerator.

In closing, I think that the
question which must be posed is
“Are some backyards more appro-
priate than others?” I think that the
answer to this last question is yes. I
think that the state made a major
mistake in its 1988 Icgislation by
Not choosing to attempt to seck a
consensus to define the meaning of
the word “appropriate.” I also think
that this question cannot be
approached without an attempt to
quantify the dangers and economic
implications of the siting of an
incinerator or incinerators. Such a
discussion requires that all known
facts be displayed openly to all con-
cerned. Without such an open dis-
cussion, the siting of a hazardous
waste incinerator anywhere would
seem to be the unjust placement of
a facility against the will of the
people affected by it.

and member of the Organization

community about the proposed
incinerator.

Bucknell needs communication

By Chris Bender

The recent history of Buc

community divided. This frustrating division has

developed through a lack ol

between the administration and students. This lack
of constructive dialogue has resulted in confusion

and the much-talked about mo)
campus. It is time to
begin addressing the
facts behind all the
misunderstandings.
The Common-
wealth of Pennsylva-
nia has placed the
administration in a
difficult position.

They have the responsibility of enforcing an unde-
sirable law with much student opposition. The State
has forced the administration to take on the respon-
sibility for the students, the responsibility which

they, as young adults, should
develop for themselves.

Students, on the other hand, feel confused and

frustrated. They don’t fully under:
feel as if they are
being punished for
unnecessary rea-
sons. They don’t
feel that they are
respected. In col-
lege, students need
to develop responsi-

bility for themselves, to become moral, individual
people. Students are limited from doing this on

Bucknell’s campus.

What happened on Halloween only reflects
the tension I’ve felt since last year. The issue may
have seemed to be alcohol, but the real issue on the
night of the protest was the desire of the students to
assume responsibility for themselves. The more
responsibility they are given, the more pride they

CBS recording artists the
Spin Doctors, in support of their
first album release earlicr this
year, will perform live tomorrow
night in Davis Gym. With all pro-
ceeds being donated to the Aids
Resource Alliance of Williams-
port, tomorrow night’s event is
the first of it’s kind for a most
intruiging reason. It is the first
social event of it’s kind at Buck-
nell to be sponsored by a multi-
faceted array of organizations,
including Kappa Delta Rho Fra-
ternity, Bucknell Board of Trus-
tees, Office of Student Activities,
Bucknell Concert Committee,
Friends of Lesbians and Gay Men
(FLAG), Panhel, and the Bison
Volunteers.

This program will be featur-
ing the Spin Doctors and is
expected to begin on Saturday
night at 10:15 p.m. and conclude
at 2 a.m.. The evening is expected
to include three hours of entirely
original rock and roll, and the
event will be preceeded by a pres-
entation by members of FLAG
regarding the current AIDS crisis
in the world. This presentation
will begin at 10 p.m.

JAZZDANCE comes to Bucknell

By Shellie Cash-Miller

Bucknell alumnus Danny
Buraczeski ‘70, now artistic direc-
tor and resident jazz choreographer
for Zenon and JAZZDANCE dance
companies in Minneapolis, Minne-
sota, is regarded as one of this
country’s leading jazz choreogra-
phers. Buraczeski, along with his
ten company members, has been at
Bucknell for a four day residency
since Wednesday. They will be here
teaching, rehersing, and performing
until tomorrow.

Buraczeski and his company
began the residency by teaching
two Master Jazz classes on Thurs-
day, and this afternoon they gave a
lecture-demonstration on the his-
tory of jazz music and dance which
ended in an open dicussion. Follow-
ing the discussion will be a Master
class in modern ballet this evening
from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.. All of
these events are being held in the
Tustin Dance Studio.

Tommorow, the dance
instruction will continue with two
dance classes for children in Tustin
Studio. These classes will be taught
by Mary Harding. The first class

from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. will be for
children ages 6 to 8 years old, and
the second class will from11 a.m. to
noon will be for children ages 8 to
10 years old. Ali of these master
classes, demonstrations, and chil-
dren’s classes are free and open to
the public.

Tomorrow evening JAZZ-
DANCE performs at the Weis Cen-
ter as a conclusion to Buraczeski’s
reidency here on campus. Buracze-
ski has choreographed a piece for
the Bucknell Dance Company
which is titled “The Road Home.”
This will be one of the pieces per-
formed in tomorrow evening’s
show.

In response to his return to
Bucknell, Buraczeski commented
that “it was early this spring that I
had the pleasure of working with
the Bucknell Dance Company for a
brief, but intense weekend. As a
student at Bucknell, I was a mem-
ber of the Dance Club, and to return
and see how the Dance Program has
grown and developed was a thrill.”
The dancers are eqully as excited to
be performing alongside of the pro-
fessionals of the JAZZDANCE
company.

From Leftfield...

Eric Smith
Staff Writers

This scason’s National Basketball Association will showcase
many new faces, as a strong draft has added many legitimate all-stars
to the teams. Look for the younger teams to do well, while some of
the top teams of previous ycars will face strong challenges from many
up-and-coming squads. This year promises to hold some surprises and
a new NBA champion to thwart the Detroit Pistons’ drive to “three-
peat.” Here are our picks in order of predicted finish:

Eastern Conference

The Philadelphia 76ers look to repeat as division champs, and
the off-scason acquisition of 7'-7" Manute Bol could be the big man to
help Charles Barkley and the crew achieve this goal. The strong inside
play of Rick Mahorn will help Phillic muscle to the top once again.
Lack of a strong bench will keep the New York Knicks from landing
on top of the division. All-Star Patrick Ewing will need the outside
shot of Kiki Vandeweghe and inspired play from Mark Jackson to
oust the 76ers. The aging Boston Celtics will need help from their
younger players to stay competitive. The Miami Heat look to rookies
Willie Burton, Alex Kessler, and Bimbo Coles to help them build a
solid team in the coming years. The Washington Bullets better be
nervous even with Pervis Ellison because not even this big man can
save them. For the New Jersey Nets and Derrick Coleman, better luck
next century, when all those draft picks might make them competitive.

Central Divisi

The “three-peat” minded Detroit Pistons have only gotten bet-
ter with age. Rookie Lance Blanks, known as a defensive specialist,
will sce limited time duc to a great starting five and the best bench in
the Ieaguc. Look for Air Jordan to Icad the Chicago Bulls into a close
battle with the Pistons. Stacey King, Scottic Pippen and Horace Grant
might make life miserable in Motown. The Indiana Pacers, led by
stand-out Reggie Miller and helped by the strong play of Detlef
Schrempf, are still missing a strong inside game to compete with the
big boys. The Cleveland Cavaliers are a good all-around team, but
the presence of Danny Ferry might catapult this team to a level of
other Cleveland sports teams: good, but not quite good enough. The
Human Highlight Film, Dominique Wilkins, will lead the Atlanta
Hawks to a respectable, but average fifth-place finish. The Milwau-
kee Bucks made few off-scason changes, and lack of a first-round
draft pick will make for a long scason. The Charlotte Hornets will
need help from rookie Kendall Gill, as well as a monster season from
J. R. Reid in order to crecp out of the cellar.

Western Conference

The San Antonio Spurs, Iced by David Robinson and friends,
will go far this scason. Drafting Dwayne Schintzius will provide a
quality back-up at center, and thus will allow the Admiral to rest for
the playoffs. The Mailman will make his rounds and the Utah Jazz
will pose a scrious threat in the division. A strong backcourt anchored
by John Stockton will help free up the inside game, and put Karl
Malone back on the starting All-Star line-up. The Icague’s best center,
Akeem “The Dream” Olajuwon, will keep the Houston Rockets in
the thick of things in the Midwest. The Dallas Mavericks will need
strong play from their guards Fat Lever, Derek Harper, and Rolando
Blackman if they are to stay above .500. The Denver Nuggets hope to
strike gold with sensational rookie Chris Jackson, but lack of defense
will keep the gold rush to a minimum. The Orlando Magic, who
acquired sharp-shooter Dennis Scott, are still lacking an inside game,
and it will show. The best named team, the Minnesota Timber-
wolves, won’t bite, but rookic Felton Spencer might help this team
win a few games.

Divisi

The Portland Trailblazers will combine strong inside and out-
side play to dethrone the L.A. Glamour Boys from the top of the divi-
sion. Clyde “The Glide” Drexler and Terry Porter will help pave the
way to the playoffs. Thc Phoenix Suns look to Tom Chambers and
Kevin Johnson to spur on the offense, while Kurt Rambis will provide
the spark needed on defense. Look for Phoenix to go far in the post-
season. The Los Angeles Lakers will necd some Magic this year.
This is a case of a strong team in a stronger division, but never count
them out. The combination of Danny Manning and Bo Kimble will
make the Los Angeles Clippers the surprise team in the Western
Division. The Golden State Warriors have the forwards in Chris
Mullin and Terry Teagle to go far, but lack of a center is their down-
fall. Head Coach K. C. Jenes will wish he were back in Boston, as the
Seattle Supersonics lack a bench. Four first-round draft choices and
numerous off-season moves will not rescuc the Sacramento Kings
from being cellar-dwellers this year.

NBA Final Round
Eric picks San Antonio to beat the Detroit Pistons, while Mark
goes with the Spurs over the 76crs.

Bucknell’s final game was

and close game. Bucknell Coach
Lynn Kachmarick felt that “our
luck just fell short at times.” After

fourth quarter, the Bison trailed 10-

It was at this point that Buck-
nell’s courage and dedication took
over. The Bison stormed back with
four unanswered goals that brought
them to within one score. With sec-
onds remaining, time ran out on a
valiant effort as Bucknell’s last
shot missed the goal, which Icft
Iona victorious 10-9.

Kachmarick lauded her team
on an impressive comeback by
stressing, “We are never a team
that gives up. We fought back until
the very end.”

Bradbury played one of his
finest games in goal to cap the sea-
son. He registered 13 saves, while
also blocking a key penalty shot.
Kevin Schroth ‘92 started the
comeback with five big goals.
Bucknell finished the champion-
ships ranked fourth out of cight

Among a field of roughly 160
players, these two star Bison stood
out by playing exceptional polo.

Reflecting on this year’s sea-
son, Kachmarick said, “We had
many big moments. Our first team
goal was to improve on our stand-
ings in last year’s tournament,
which we did.”

As the season progressed, the
Bison reset their goals to reflect
their improving performance.
Bucknell was ranked as high as #19
nationally, a tribute not only to the
players and coaches, but to the
entire water polo program as well.

Coach Kachmarick sums up
her team’s effort by maintaining,
“We had a quality group of young
men and women who represented
Bucknell with class, sportsmanship,
and played with their heart and soul
every weekend.”

Graduation will leave the
Bison with some big losses, includ-
ing Zeigler, Mead Briggs, Tim
Smaldone and two dedicated man-
agers, Wendy Fillippo and Brid-
gette Cleft.

The returning squad will be
very competitive next year. Boast-
ing top scorers Schroth, Brown,
and Walter Kelly ‘92, Bucknell will
also return the top goalie in the
East, Bradbury. After an extremely
successful season, the Bison water
polo squad can stand tall and walk
proud.

Wide receiver Lester Erb ’91 earns Athlete of the Weck hon-
ors following his record-setting performance in last weeks football
game versus Holy Cross. Erb hauled in both Bison touchdowns dur-
ing the team's 43-14 loss to the Crusaders.

Those two catches gave Erb the Bucknell single-season record
for touchdown receptions with 10. This surpassed the previous
mark set by Mike Guerrini in 1987.

Erb is now tied with former Bucknell great Tom Mitchell 66
for carcer touchdown receptions with 18. Tomorrow at Lehigh, Erb
will have an opportunity to set a new record should he catch a
touchdown pass.

Erb, who is third on the Bucknell all-time receiving yard list
with 1,664, has caught 35 passes for 580 yards this season.

Honorable Mention

Kevin Schroth 92 led a valiant comeback on the part of the
water polo squad, which placed fourth at the Mid-Atlantic Champi-
onships in Princeton, New Jersey last weekend.

After trailing to castern powerhouse Iona by six goals in the
game's final quarter, Schroth sparked the Bison offense with five
goals. Unfortunately, the comeback fell just short and the Bison lost
10-9. For his efforts, Schroth was named to the All-Tournament
first team.

Volleyball to conclude year
at Patriot League tournament

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The women’s volleyball tcam
will travel to Holy Cross tomorrow
for the Patriot League Champion
ships, as the Lady Bison look to
upset the Lady Red Raiders of Col-
gate University in both teams’ first-
round match.

Colgate has already beaten
Bucknell once this season 15-7, 15-
4, 15-2, but that hasn’t discouraged
Bucknell Coach Cindy Opalski’s
squad, who is still hungry for its
first Patriot League win.

Army won the regular-season
title and grabbed the top seed of
this weckend’s tourney, giving the
Lady Cadets a first round bye. Col-
gate took the second seed.

“T think winning the confer-

ence championship is a realistic
goal,” said Opalski. “We know we
can play at this level and anything
can happen in a tournament.”

If Bucknell manages to beat
Colgate the Lady Bison would play
the winner of the Holy Cross-
Lafayette game.

The winner of the Fordham-
Lehigh game is scheduled to take
on Army. If the Lady Bison lose
their initial game, the best they
could do is third place.

Bucknell was supposed to
take on the Golden Eagles of Clar-
ion University last Saturday for a
final warm-up before the tourna-
ment, but Clarion’s bus broke down
and the match had to be cancelled.
Bucknell finished the  regular-
season with a 3-19 record overall,
0-6 in conference play.

attack, the shorthanded defense got
caught with a three on two disad-
vantage that Lafayette’s Temo Pape
capitalized on to give the Leopards
some extra insurance. That goal
quieted the Bucknell crowd for the
time, but the fans responded as the
Bison continued to play hard.
Bucknell’s Bill Connors ‘93 headed
a ball over the Lafayette keeper’s
head into the goalmouth two min-
utes later, but the Leopards’s All-
League defenseman Tom Neale
came out from nowhere to rob the
Bison with a beautiful bicycle kick
save from the goal line. This play
just seemed to typify Bucknell’s
day.

drove again for the touchdown 45
yards in 11 plays, seven of which
were on the ground. The touch-
down was again scored by Segreti,
who dove over the left side to make
the score 28-14. He ended the day
rushing for an even 100 yards on
20 carries.

The next Holy Cross score
came following a blocked punt.
The Crusaders took over the ball on
the Bucknell 16. Jerome Fuller ran
the ball down to the two-yard line
on the next play to set up the score.
The score marked 21 unanswered
points in just over nine minutes of
play.

After punts by both teams,
Jeff Kelly ‘92 was brought in to try
and cut down Holy Cross’ 21-point
lead. He was 2-5 in his first drive
for 14 yards. While Kelly was una-
ble to take the Bison into scoring
position, he did take the offense

On Sunday, Lafayette played
the winner of the other semifinal
matchup, Fordham, for the League
Championship. Once again, regula-
tion ended with the two teams in a
scoreless tie. This time, Lafayette
was not as fortunate as Fordham’s
Rado Randriamamongy scored at
2:56 of the first extra period to give
the Rams the victory and the title.
The win ended an exciting week-
end of collegiate soccer at Bucknell
that featured two overtime games
and a 1-0 victory by Fordham over
Colgate on Saturday.

first time since halftime.

Holy Cross took over on its
own 24-yard line following a 25-
yard punt by John Toman ‘92. Holy
Cross then drove 76 yards on 6
plays scoring just 12 seconds into
the fourth quarter on a 40-yard pass
from Ciaccio to Gallagher.

Gallagher caught a total of
seven passes on the day for 70
yards. The score was set up by a
17-yard run by Segreti and a 16-
yard pass to Jack Lavelette. The
score became 43-14 as Gallagher
dove into the endzone after fielding
a low snap for the two-point
conversion.

The only highlight of the
fourth quarter was a drive which
began with a 30-yard pass from
Kelly to Matt Walsh ‘93. That was
Walsh’s third catch of the day for a
total of 51 yards. On the next Kevin
McElvene ‘93 ran for 13 yards up

Kelly fumbled while scrambling on
third down and long play.

Though the Bison didn’t play
in the finals on Sunday, their sea-
son was by no means a
disappointment.

With the mediocrity that the
team had displayed in the past, its
12-5-1 record showed remarkable
improvement from 1989, and they
surprised quite a few teams this
year.

“We had reservations going
into this season,” said Reynolds.
“In all honesty, we were just hop-
ing for a .500 season. As things
went on we just gained more and
more confidence. Everyone made a
sincere effort to make the team the
first priority. I think the seniors
and the team as a whole was tired
of being mediocre. I’m really
happy for the seniors and their

has faith in the defense. “We still
have to be able to make the plays in
tough situations.

The defense was in bad field
position three times in the second
half and Holy Cross scored on all
three. We have to stop them on at
least one of those.” Bucknell was
only able to muster 226 yards of its
own, and only 58 in the second
half. Bucknell only got three first
downs in the second half. The team
rushed for -2 yards in the final two
quarters.

Next week the Bison travel to
Lehigh, to take on the Engineers
who are 6-3, 2-1 in the Patriot
League. Lehigh is coming off a big
52-7 win against Colgate which put
them in second place in the Patriot
League, just a game behind the
Crusaders.

The Bison must figure a way
to keep the quality of their play
equal from the first half to the sec-
ond if they hope to win. Also, they
have to stick to the basics. The
series which dates back all the way
to 1888 is led by the Engineers 26-

“T think the key was that we
had some leadership from all the
Seniors this year,” said tri-captain
Terry Pelino ‘91. “We had great
team chemistry.”

“We were so successful
because all the guys were closer
this year,” echoed tri-captain Kirk
Lorie ‘91. “We had more fun, there
was a better atmosphere, and we
were winning.”

“It wasn’t even necessarily
skill,” continued ti-captain Bran-
don Poe ‘91. “It was much more
enjoyable to play because of the
way people wanted to win for each
other.”

Reynolds probably summed it

oly Cross thrashes football 43-14

Bison look to snap three-game skid tomorrow at Lehigh

By Scott Brown
Staff Writer

The Bison football team con
tinued to dropping its
third straight 43-14 to Holy Cross
in Worcester, Massachusetts last
Saturday. With the loss, the Bison
slipped into fourth-place in the
Patriot League with a 1-2 record.

All four of the Bucknell’s
losses have come in a similar man-
ner. Bucknell has played well in the
first half and then been outplayed
in the second half. In the four
defeats, Bucknell has outscored its
opponents 77-44 in the first half,
only to be outscored in the second
half of those games 103-26. Head
Coach Lou Maranzana realizes this
problem: “We've started out better
than we've finished. Teams have
had better play in the second half.
We are learning how to continuc to
improve throughout the game after
our good start.”

A big reason for this discrep-
ancy can be attributed to the inabil-

struggle,

ity to bolster a running game in
each of the losses. When the Bison
have won they have done so by
averaging 224 yards a game on 54
carries. In defeat, Bucknell has
averaged only 144 yards a game,
running the ball just 36 times a
contest. Bucknell gains almost
twice as many yards per Carry in
victory than in defeat. Bucknell
has not rushed for 200 yards since
October 6 against Towson State
when it rushed for 309 yards.

The game at Holy Cross last
Saturday was no different as Buck-
nell ended with 38 carries for only
25 yards. The leading rusher was
Brian Henesey ‘91 who rushed for
31 yards on 11 attempts. He has
only rushed for 140 yards in the
last four games, as opposed to 527
yards in his first five. Maranzana
stressed the importance of the run-
ning game stating, “The running
game is absolutely a key to win-
ning. It allows us to possess the
ball and do the things we want to
do. It helps our passing game as

well as our defense.”

The Crusaders had the
game’s first score on their second
possession following a three-yard
punt by Jason Fralick ‘93, Fralick
had a rough day before being
replaced late in the third quarter.
He punted six times on the day for
an average net of only 19.3 yards.
He also had one of his kicks
blocked. Holy Cross got the ball on
its own 41 yard line and drove the
59 yards in just four plays culmi-
nating with a screen pass from Tom
Ciaccio to Michael Lewis which
totalled 37 yards.

Holy Cross got the ball back
on the Bison 39-yard line after forc-
ing Bucknell to punt after three
plays. The Crusaders went the 39
yards in nine plays finishing with a
five-yard pass from a scrambling
Ciaccio to Mark Gallagher to make
the score 14-0 with 3 minutes 47
seconds to play in the first quarter.

Bucknell did battle back,
though, scoring a touchdown on its
next possession to narrow the gap

to seven points. The drive, which
covered 70 yards, was kept alive by
a holding call on Holy Cross on 4th
down and 3. It was also sparked by
Todd Hatajik ‘91’s 24-yard comple-
tion to Dan Scocca ‘91. The touch-
down was a 31-yard Hatajik strike
over the middle to a wide open
Lester Erb ‘91.

The Crusaders opened second
quarter by driving all the way to the
Bucknell four-yard line, before Pat
Kenny missed a 21-yard field goal.
Bucknell got the ball back on its
own 20-yard line, and mounted a
ball control drive which lasted over
five minutes before tying the score
on a quick pass in the left corner of
the endzone from Hatajik to Erb.
Erb’s second touchdown catch gave
him his 18th career touchdown
reception putting him in a tie for
first on Bucknell’s all-time list. It
was also his 10th touchdown recep-
tion of the season, a new Bucknell
record. For the day, Erb had six
catches for 77 yards. He has caught
passes totalling 1,664 yards for his
career placing him third all-time at
Bucknell.

At halftime, the statistics were
fairly even with a slight advantage
going to the Crusaders, who had 247
yards total offense compared to
Bucknell’s 168. Ciaccio was 13-17

for 181 yards with two touchdown
passes including five passes to
Lewis for 117 yards. Hatajik was
11-17 for 141 yards with two
touchdown passes.

The second half, however,
was all Holy Cross, particularly the
third quarter, in which the Crusad-
ers scored on four of the five pos-
sessions. The first Holy Cross pos-
session began on the Bucknell 30
yard line, following a 15-yard
return of a 29-yard Fralick punt. It
took the Crusaders just 1:29 to

score, taking a seven-point lead that
they would not relinquish. The
touchdown was scored by fullback
Joe Segreti on a six-yard burst up

Men’s soccer finishes season
with semifinal loss to Lafayette

By Chad Bown
Staff Writer

An excellent men’s soccer
season came to an unfortunate and
abrupt end last Saturday, when
Bucknell lost to Lafayette in the
first round of the Patriot League
playoffs. The defeat was in no way
indicative of the Bison’s outstand-

ing year. Fordham was the weck-
end’s big winner, as they took the
overall championship.

Bucknell hosted the fourth-
seeded Lafayette Leopards for the
first semifinal matchup before a
large Bison crowd on an Indian
summer-like day. Lafayette came
out strong, and it took some great
defense from the Bucknell full-

backs to prevent them from grab-
bing the early Icad. The Bison were
careless and seemed complacent in
the early going, and almost paid the
price when Lafayette had a clear
shot on goal at 5:00 but only man-
aged to hit the post.

“We were terribly flat in the
first fifteen minutes,” stated Coach
Reynolds. “I assume we were just

tight. The problem was we just
never got into the tempo of the
game.”

The Bison hung on to the end
of the half and were lucky to find
the score still knotted at 0-0. Buck-
nell was clearly outplayed and
could mount very little offensive
pressure in the opening stanza.

The second half proved more
interesting for both sides, as each
team had many golden opportuni-
ties to score. Alex Kogan ‘94, Dan
D’Angelo ‘92, and Jon Mackenzie
“93 all showed offensive improve-
ment in the second half, but still the
Bison could not put one ball into
the net. Both Bucknell and Lafay-
ette each exchanged offensive flur-
ries in the final minute of play
before regulation ended in a score-
less tie.

The format of the overtime
entailed two extra fifteen minute
periods, to be played to their com-
pletion. The Bison had the first
chance to score when Steve John-
son ‘91 broke free from the Lafay-
ette defense and looked poised for a
goal before a great individual effort
from the Leopards’s Bill Mazor
stopped the Bison’s offensive
threat.

Bucknell caught some luck of
its own when Lafayette’s Rob Dos-
tert found himself in front of the
net with a clear attempt on goal, but
he slipped on the grass and was
unable to get a shot off. The good
luck was short lived, however, as
Lafayette’s Scott Reamer knocked
his own rebound past Bucknell
keeper Mark Wrigley ‘94 with 59

Deardorff °92, Jeff Loomis °92,
Bob Kelly °92, Jason Cahilly °92,
and Tom Wuchenich ’92. Colgate’s
Thomas Kennedy kept the Bison
from grabbing all of the top-ten
spots by placing seventh.

Kennedy’s performance
helped the Red Raiders to capture
second-place with 67 points, well
behind Bucknell’s total of 15. Ford-
ham finished third with 102 points,
with Lafayette (106), Lehigh (106),
and Holy Cross (135) rounding out
the field.

The women’s team also
clashed with Patriot League oppo-
nents in hopes of bringing Bucknell
a clean sweep. Unfortunately five
other teams had other plans and the
Lady Bison were forced to settle
for sixth place.

Fordham’s Lauren Gubicza
won the individual title while lead-
ing the Lady Rams charge to the
championship, as the team finished
with an impressive 22 point total.

Nancy Sullivan of Holy Cross fin

teammates Karen Cloran and Ann

On Sunday September 16,
Lewisburg Police apprehended two
eighteen-year-old Bucknell — stu-
dents on South Fifth Street and
cited them for consumption and
possession of alcohol under the
legal age of 21. During question-
ing, the two students indicated that
they had been drinking at a party

After a two hour confronta-
tion early Sunday morning, Cur-
ran Robert McCann ’93, was
arrested and charged with more
than 10 counts of different mis-
meanor and summary charges.

According to Union
County Court records, at approxi-
mately 12:50 am. on Sunday,
Nov. 11, a resident assistant con-
tacted the Department of Security
and Safety to report excessive
noise coming from a room on the
4th floor of Larison Hall.

Information released by the
Department of- Security and
Safety indicates that the R.A.
confronted an unknown person,
later identified as McCann, and
asked him to leave the premises.
McCann then proceeded to refuse
and became violent, threatening
members of the hall.

Security officers James
Warner and Sgt. Dolores Stafford
were dispatched to the scene at
1:03 a.m. to investigate the report
of a “Disorderly Person.” Warner
reported that he arrived on the
fourth floor of Harris Hall, at
which time he attempted to
obtain identification from
McCann. According to Warner,

in progress. The residents, Stephen
Casey °91, Brandon Poe ’91 and
David Gutheil ’91 are all members
of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

According to Lewisburg
Police reports, during a meeting
with Lieutenant Lee Yount the
three residents said that the party
was really a TKE  fraternity-
sponsored function and the beer
was furnished by members of the
TKE fraternity. Tau Kappa Epsilon
was consequently charged with two
counts of furnishing alcohol to a
minor, a violation of Pennsylvania
Criminal! Code #6310.1.

Mark Roessler ’92, the presi-
dent of TKE fraternity, refused to
comment at the present time. Nei-
ther Casey, Poe, nor Gutheil could
be reached for comment.

See CHARGES, page 2

he was “met with negative results.”
Moments later, Stafford arrived
and reports that she attempted “to
intervene and calm [McCann]
down.”

Both officers reported that
McCann became verbally abusive,
and then proceeded to push Staf-
ford out of the way and run from
Harris Hall into Larison Hall. The
officers pursued McCann, and
caught up with him in the second
floor stairwell of Harris. According
to Warner, McCann “smelled like
beer and appeared to be
intoxicated.”

The officers once again
attempted to obtain identification
from McCann, but were unable to
succeed. McCann, report the offi-
cers, was verbally abusive and
approached Warner “in an offen-
sive manner.”

According to Warmer,
McCann screamed, “F— you
assh—, f—ing fat pig mother f—
ers.”

According to court records,
Warner stated that McCann then
“threw a punch and hit me in the
neck, after he had pushed me, and
the punch knocked me into the rail-
ing of the stairs. I attempted to
defend myself by pushing him in
the chest to get him away from me,
so that he couldn’t push me down

wrestle me to the ground and as a
result we both fell to the floor and
I was able to temporarily restrain
him.”

Warner explained that he
released his hold on McCann and
the two returned to their feet.

Warner reported that
McCann “continually got in our
faces yelling statements such as
“You f—ing pig, You fat f—, I’m
going to kill you.’”

At’ 1:13) am. Stafford
requested the presence of Director
of Security Vince DeCerchio.
Although McCann continued to
use abusive language, Stafford
explained that she and Warner
were satisfied with letting him
“scream and yell until Director
DeCerchio arrived.” Both offi-
cers’ security reports collaborated
with one another

Upon his arrival at 1:19

identified himself as the director

Curriculum debate continues

By Lisa Hirschkorn
Staff Writer

Critical thinking and multi-
perspectives lie at the heart of the
General Education Council’s cur-
riculum proposal. Spurred by last
May’s student petition, the debate
on education continues, and the
revised “freshman foundation semi-
nar” might be only six weeks away.

“Within six weeks, we'll
know what the recommendation
is,” said Jackson Hill Associate
Dean of Arts and Sciences. The
General Education Council’s rec-
ommendation, if approved by the
Curriculum Committee, will then
go to the floor of the faculty. These
recommendations, in turn, could go
into effect next semester for the
Class of ‘95. In the meantime, the
proposal airs on the debate floor as
students, faculty and administrators
tackle complex issues.

“The students presented the
petition to me last May.” said Larry
Shinn, vice-president of academic
affairs. Shinn explained “What I
promised the students first of all is
that I would present the petition to
the faculty itself at its first meeting
in the fall. The students are asking
us to consider a formal requirement
for race, gender and other kinds of
‘otherness’ studies that they believe
is appropriate for every Bucknell
student to have.” ;

Yet, the general education
council, formed two years ago,
began discussing multicultural

4

issues before the student petition
wielded their demands. In Septem-
ber, 1989, Shinn’s initiative to
relate students’ attitudes in the
classroom and in actuality began.

Shinn said “Independent of
that petition coming I had already
decided that previous spring to
name a committee this fall on The
Climate for Learning and Diversity
at Bucknell. The intention of this
study is to ascertain the need for
sensitizing students to courses of
race and gender. The Committee
asks questions about the extent to
which we are providing a hospita-
ble climate — for women and for
minorities, for example. I don’t
mean just in the classroom but also
in the social and _ residential
environment.”

While the General Educa-
tional Council has been considering
this petition,” Shinn continued, “I
have been meeting with this com-
mittee, the Climate for Learning
and Diversity at Bucknell, which
has about twenty-five members —
they are students, faculty, adminis-
trators, and support persons. The
intention of this group is to investi-
gate what actually is the learning
environment at Bucknell — from
the perceptions of students, from
the perceptions of faculty, and the
perceptions of alumni, support
staff, and support offices on cam-
pus” [support offices include peo-
ple from the library to the Multicul-
tue Center, and support persons
range from custodians to secretar-

ies]. Shinn explained that these four
separate groups, derived from the
large steering committee, will con

duct surveys and interviews of each
respective group — students

alumni, faculty, and support offices
and support staff.

The General Education
Council is appointed by the faculty
of the College of Arts and Sciences
and its Council Members are as fol
lows: the Dean and Associate Dean
of Arts and Sciences, six faculty
members, a Race/Gender represen-
tative, and a Curriculum Commit-
tee representative. The Council’s
eventual proposal will pass from
the departments to the Curriculum
Committee, and then onto the
faculty.

“The process is quite cum-
bersome and that’s part of the trou-
ble that the students who presented
the petition have — they just
thought we could just do it, “ said
Eugenia Gerdes, Dean of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences. Gerdes
expounded upon this actual process
and the goals of the Council.

“Before the petition was
even developed, we talked about
the integration of race, gender and
multiculture issues into the curricu-
lum. We brought the issue to the
General Education Council and we
said, ‘look this group is interested
in how we’re planning to integrate
and if we’re planning to integrate
race, gender and multiculture issues

Graves in memory of the 54 U.S. soldiers who have died in the Gulf conflict were placed on the uphill side
of the Langone Center by S.T.O.P., Students and Teachers Organized for Peace.

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Fifty-four mock graves were
placed on the uphill side of the
Langone Center on Tuesday in
memory of the soldiers who have
died thus far in the Persian Gulf
Conflict. The ‘grave tally’ will
remain until Thanksgiving. The
emerging activist organization
STOP, Students and Teachers
Organized for Peace, used the
graves to encourage “people to edu-
cate themselves, to discuss the
issue, and ... to join us,” according
to Mark Larson ‘92, a member of
the twelve person committee.
STOP has several other activities
planned this semester to increase
awareness of the situation in the
Persian Gulf.

According to Larson, “The
Bucknell progressive caucus
formed a subcommittee to begin to
react to the situation in the Gulf ...
STOP has been organized by a
group of students who are opposed
to a war in the Gulf, who feel that
the present course of events is lead-

ing us toward that war for reasons
that are either hypocritical or
illegal.”

Larson explained that STOP
does not “condone what Saddam
did, it’s obviously wrong,” but says
“continued sanctions against Iraq”
is the answer.

STOP finds serious problems
with the reasons that the U.S. is
involved in the conflict. Larson
identified three possible reasons
that the U.S. could use for going to
war, and the reasons why STOP
feels that they are not compelling.
“If we’re going to war for oil, the
oil provided by Iraq and Kuwait,
and even ... Saudi Arabia represents
only 15% of the world population
of oil, and a minimal amount of
U.S. oil. If we’re going to war to
punish Iraq ... the U.S. has a lot of
outstanding issues that it itself
should deal with in terms of its
attacks on Panama, Grenada, and
the Dominican Republic. If we’re
going to war to defend this new
world order in which the U.S. acts
as the policeman or big brother
who’s going to dictate the morality

of this world don’t
approve of that.’

Larson emphasized that there
are other options for handling the
Gulf crisis. “We don’t want to fall
into the trap where you either con-
done what Saddam Hussein did or
agree with what President Bush is
doing.”

STOP’s plans include a letter
writing drive to members of the
U.N., Congress, and White House
staff. More importantly “‘we’re try-
ing to make a public statement
aobut our opposition to war in the
Gulf.” STOP has passed out rib-
bons to those people who wish to
voice their disagreement with U.S.
policy in the Gulf

As an effort to involve more
students, STOP sent letters to
every professor asking them to
take 30 minutes out of class time
and Larson
explained that professors are free
to decide whether they think it is
professional to do so. “It’s an indi-
vidual choice for the professor.”

Joe Clark speaks at Weis Center

Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian

Joe Clark signs autographs after speaking at the Weis Center Wednesday night.

By Tara G. Gilligan
Staff Writer

In a dramatic display of met-
aphors, cliches, and allusions to lit-
erature, Joe Clark, on whom the
movie Lean on Me was based, told
a capacity audience to never stop
trying to succeed. Clark, wha spoke
at the Weis Center on Wednesday,
discussed the importance of suc-
ceeding, the concerns of blacks, and
of the troubles in the educational
system.

“Tam the master of my fate,
the captain of my soul, and thus I
say to you this glorious evening,
Bison, be sure, be very, very, very
sure that you are in control of your
own destiny,” said Clark, who has
been recognized as a controversial
figure because of the actions he
took as principal of Eastside High.
Clark transformed the New Jersey
high school from a haven for drugs
to a respectable school.

Clark seemed proud of his
controversial status, pointing out
that throughout history, only con-
troversial nations contributed any-

thing to the world. Contrasting
these nations to the neutral Switzer-
land, he said, “The only thing
Switzerland gave the world was the
cuckoo clock.”

Once a child in a family on
welfare, Clark claims that only per-
sistence will bring about success.
“Whatever you do in this life don’t
you ever give up, don’t you ever
quit ... The slaughterhouse of fail-
ing is not your destiny. You must
persist to succeed,” he said.

Clark ended this portion of
his speech by saying that “success
is failure turned inside out.”

And, once again turning to
cliche, Clark pointed out that
America can succeed only when
everyone works together. “Divided
we will fall, together we will
stand,” he said.

“There’s something I
believe, Bison ... I belive that some-
how we’re going to bring about
some changes in this world,” Clark
said. And the changes he referred
to, came out in his vocal opposition
to programs such as affirmative
action.

“History shows me that affirmative
action and quota svstems have
never worked anywhere else in the
world,” he said, pointing out failed
programs in Malasia, India, and
Nigeria.

With a dominating tone in
his voice, Clark asked, “Don’t you
understand that you cannot do for
people what they cannot do them-
selves. You cannot take from one
person and give to another.”

Clark, himself a black
American, displayed his agitation
at being called an African Ameri-
can. The label, he said, has divided
the black population in America
into two groups.

“We have become a nation-
ality of squibbling nationalities,” he
said.

Poking fun at distinction by
color, Clark said, “The color of
freedom is green. I have enough
money to do whatever I want to
do.”

Clark also discussed the
problems in the educational system,
saying that teachers are the founda-
tion of America, though they

remain “overworked, underpaid,
{and] controlled by administrators
and bureaucrats.”

An advocate of allowing
parents to decide where to send
their children for school, Clark
pointed out that America’s students
are poor in math science and
spelling.

Clark began his attempts to
reform education by starting at
Eastside High, where drug abuse
was rampant.

In curbing the drug problem
in Eastside High, Clark made some
controversial decisions. Immedi-
ately upon becoming principal of
the school, Clark expelled 300 stu-
dents who he referred to as “thugs
and pathological deviants” and who
he had no hope of affecting. Today,
Clark claims the high school is
drug free.

But besides expelling the
core of drug dealers, Clark’s disci-
plinary measures were met by criti-
cism from some. Often Clark stood
in the hall with a bullhorn, telling
students to walk quickly to class
and to stay on the right side of the
hall. Not willing to accept tardi-
ness, Clark once suspended 500
students in a single day for
tardiness.

“To me, he’s too much of a
dictator to run a school. It had to be
his way or no way,” said one
teacher who eventually resigned
from Eastside High.

“Oh I admit that maybe
once a week I have a crucifixion
just to boost morality,” Clark said
in a Connie Chung special which
he showed to the audience.

Despite the harsh fist with
which he governed, Clark main-
tains that “discipline is not the
enemy of enthusiasm.”

Clark may have been the
object of much criticism, but he did
have followers as well, A member
of the first class to go through four
years with Clark as the principal
spoke of him in her graduation
speech. “You have been our parents
when they were not there. You
became our friend when we didn’t
have any,” she said.

After giving away a video
tape of the Connie Chung special
he showed and a copy of a book
written about him to two members
of the audience, Clark closed his
speech. “Bison, you be the best of
whatever you are,” he said.

ROTC works to comply with uni-
versity non-discriminatory policy

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

Though Mark Larson ‘91
stated that the Department of
Defense policy that bars known gay
men and lesbians from enlisting in
the armed forces is “the most bla-
tant symbolic act of discrimination
against gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual
people that exists in this country,”
he admits that when it comes to the
relationship between ROTC and the
University’s non-discriminatory
Clause the issue becomes more
complex.

“Right now we are exploring
what the policy at ROTC is in terms
of the acceptance and participation
of gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual stu-
dents,” Larson said, “‘and if in the
relationship between the University
and ROTC there is a discrepancy, a
violation of the non-discriminatory
clause.”

During the last academic year
“sexual orientation” was added to
the University’s non-discriminatory
clause which states that the Univer-
sity “does not discriminate [on the
basis of race, creed, etc.]...in the
administration of its educational
policies, admissions policies, schol-
arship and loan programs, and ath-
letics and other University-
administered programs.” Larson
and members of the Friends of
Gays and Lesbians and the Gay,
Lesbian, the Bucknell Progressive
Caucus, and Bi-sexual Awareness
Group are concerned that the
Defense Department regulations
that the Reserve Officers Training
Corps follows may place it in viola-
tion of the non-discriminatory
clause.

In the past few years ROTC

programs at other university cam-
puses across the country have been
challenged on precisely these
grounds, resulting in the severing
of ties between those universities
and their respective ROTC pro-
grams. At those schools, as is the
case at Bucknell, ROTC made use
of university facilities and other
material support in pursuing their
educational programs oriented
toward military training and devel-
oping leadership skills.

Lieutenant Colonel Thomas
Mclver, director of the Susque-
hanna Unit of the Army ROTC,
stated that “on the surface there is a
conflict, but the fact is that the
Department of Defence policy does
not apply to the University.”
McIver said that the classes that
ROTC offers through the Univer-
sity are open to all students includ-
ing homosexuals. Rather it is at the
particular moment when the student
signs a contract with the Army that
the policy that bars homosexuals
comes into play.

“There are no restrictions on
involvement in ROTC programs;
there are restrictions about who we
will contract as officers,” McIver
said. “I am under no orders to
exclude people from ROTC.”

It is just this issue of this
split between ROTC programs and
the function of commissioning offi-
cers, according to Larson, that is
most difficult to resolve. At present
he said that he was attempting to
understand “to what extent does
that contract become integral to
ROTC and if it is central, does that
place ROTC in violation of the
nondiscriminatory clause?”

- Mclver stated that there are
often people who do belong to

ROTC, but do not have an interest
in being commissioned officers. At
present though, all of the Bucknell
juniors and seniors involved in
ROTC have signed contracts with
the Army, and according to
Department of Defence policy it is
to be supposed that none of them
are gay or lesbian.

When questioned as to
ROTC possibly being in conflict
with the nondiscriminatory clause,
Sojka said that his “immediate
reaction would not be to throw the
rascals out.” Prefacing his com-
ments with the reminder that he is
a molecular biologist and a bit out
of his depth on this issue, Sojka
stated that “while the military can
be chided for being slow, it is very
clear that the military has the abil-
ity to significantly impact society
in a positive manner” suggesting
that the military could revamp its
policies in the future to include
gays and lesbians.

Sojka cited the financial aid
that ROTC scholarships offer to
Bucknell students and the impor-
tance of having liberally educated
persons in the officers corp of the
military—at present over 70% of
all officers are ROTC trained—as
significant factors to consider. “At
this point I am not quick to break
off our relations with the Army,
but this is my personal view and
Not institutional policy,” Sojka
said. “Yet there does appear to be
something directly different from
what we have in our nondiscrimi-
natory clause and I would at least
like to see a better justification.”

In terms of the financial aid
that ROTC offers to students, Lar-
son agreed that a severing of ties

would could prevent a number of -

students from attending the
University.

“Obviously there would be a
loss of scholarships, especially for
students from working-class back-
grounds,” Larson said. “Yet, we
would hope that the University
would maintain its commitment to
diversity on this campus by increas-
ing scholarships to these people.”

The Department of Defense’s
rationale, as McIver understands it,
is that homosexuality its incompati-
ble with military service. “This pol-
icy has not come under much scru-
tiny,” according to Mclver, “court
challenges have been like the most
recent one involving Staff Sergeant
Watkins—they did not address the
policy itself, but only the consis-
tency with which it was applied.

(Staff Sergeant Watkins, in a
recent Supreme Court Decision,
was approved for re-enlistment
after the Court found that the Army
had once approved his re-
enlistment despite the fact that they
knew him to be gay. As a result the
Court declared the Army’s attempt
in 1982 to bar his re-enlistment on
the grounds of inconsistency.)

Mclver stated that his own
position on this issue was that a gay
man or lesbian could serve the mili-
tary honorably and that unknown to
the military many already have. In
the next few months, McIver said,
the General Accounting Office
would be examining the Depart-
ment of Defence’s policy, but he
does not share Sojka’s optimism
about the future.

“The climate in the military
is an interactive one and there is
room for dissent” McIver said, “but

Umbrella endorses
slate of candidates

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

The Umbrella Organization
has endorsed a slate of candidates
for this Tuesday’s Bucknell Stu-
dent Government election in the
first action of its kind. The deci-
sion to endorse a slate of candi-
dates “came out of a group discus-
sion because Umbrella felt that
BSG had not adequately repre-
sented the variety of student
voices on campus,” according to
Mark Larson a member of the
Umbrella steering committee

Larson explained the
Umbrella had problems because
“the style of leadership that has
been presently operating within
BSG has been a very hierarchical
officer dominated leadership.”

Umbrella sent a flyer to stu
dents listing the slate of candi
dates that they endorsed. Those
candidates are Bill Lee for presi
dent, Vanessa Mayo for treasurer
Megan Karekelian for first vice
president, and Mare Rasmussen
for second vice president

In terms of how effective
the slate will be Larson said, “It’s
hard to tell but I would hope that
a good percentage of Umbrella
would vote for the candidates.”

Some of the candidates run
ning were upset that they never
had the chance to address

Umbrella to which Larson
responded, “This is the first time,
and if people were really upset
with that, then we will try to
repsond to that in a more fair
manner” in the future. Larson did
defend the slate though, explain-
ing that “at the same time we have
put forward candidates who we
feel very comfortable representing
what Umbrella does ... And once
again we’re endorsing these can-
didates as four candidates we feel
will do an excellent job, but we’re
not saying that everyone has to
according to what we’re
saying.”

Larson also defended the
group against the charge of back-
ing single-issue candidates. “First,
we do represent a wide varicty of
opinions, and secondly, the type
of leadership that we stress is
open to all opinions.” Larson
was unable to say how
Umbrella candidates
would be open to Greek opinions
He noted that there are Greeks in
Umbrella but he also said, “We

Student activism

increasing

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

“We believe the recent cra of
student self-preoccupation, which
began in the middle 1970's with the
end of the Vietnam War, is drawing
to a close. Students appear to be
making the transition to a period of
social engagement,” wrote Arthur
Levine, chair of the Institute for
Educational Management in Har
vard’s School of Education, and
Deborah Hirsch, former assis to
the president of Bradford C :
in The Chronical of Higher E
tion, November 7, 1990.

Levine and Hirsch concludec
that college “students he
lowed a cyclical pattern, os
back and forth between [
preoccupation and social enga
ment.” The three previous cycles
this century were determined by ti
occurrence of World Wars I and I
and Vietnam. “These were times
which the activism and
unrest of the Progressive Era, the
Depression, and the 1960's gave
way to self-improvement crazes in
the 1920's; panty raids, telep
booth stuffing, and general di
est in the ‘silent generation
1950's; and streaking, toga |
and yuppicism in the 1970's
1980's.”

Levine and
that students are moving into
activist stage because of twely
years of research in which they
have tracked the attitudes of stu-
dents at 20 colleges and universi
ties. They cite a more optimistic
view of the “collective future,” an
increase in college heroes,
socially oriented job market, and an
increase in social action (including
volunteerism and protest), as evi

Leaders ask for
special session

Congressional leaders from
both parties urged President Bush
Tuesday to convene a special ses-
sion on the Persian Gulf crisis, as
the Administration confronted
increasing concerns about a Middle
East war.

The White House was
opposed to the special session, say-
ing that it would undermine Bush’s
strategy

Senator Richard Lugar, rank-
ing Republican on the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, said the
President’s near doubling of troops
in the gulf region “has set the
United States on a collision course
in which Iraq will either withdraw
from Kuwait or be forced to do so
by military means.”

Some Democrats who
favored a special session hoped to
limit the President’s ability to com-
mit troops to war. Senator Edward
Kennedy, Democrat from Massa-
chusetts, said the United States is
on a “headlong course toward war”
and said, “Silence by Congress now
is an abdication of our constitu-
tional responsibility and an acquies-
cence in war.”

George Mitchell, the Senate
majority leader, voiced his con-
cerns, saying that the President
“has no legal authority, none what-
soever” to order an offensive attack
against Iraq

Thatcher faces
leadership fight

Sir Geoffrey Howe, former
deputy prime minister, challenged
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
in his first speech before Parlia-
ment since resigning November 1,
by delivering a stinging attack on
her opposition to greater economic
and political integration of Europe.

Howe did not rule out the
possibility that he may challenge
Thatcher as leader of the Conserva-
tive Party and Prime Minister, but
he seemed to suggest that this move
was for others to make.

Howe resigned following a

European Community summit
meeting in Rome, where leaders of
the 11 member nations agreed to
try to proceed rapidly toward the
creation of a central bank and a
common currency. Thatcher ridi-
culed and rejected that goal.

Yeltsin fights
new union plan

President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia announced Monday that he
was rebuffing attempts by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev to
draft a new union treaty before
deciding such issues as control over
diamonds, petroleum, banking, and
other economic resources.

Negotiations between Yeltsin
and Gorbachev signaled that the
Kremlin is ready to create a new
union treaty which would allow the
nation’s 15 republics greater sove-
reignty that they are demanding,
while still preserving a viable
national government.

Yeltsin rejected the Krem-
lin’s attempts to ensure that “‘for the
time being” the disputed economic
resources “would lie within the
center’s competence.” Russia, the
richest republic in natural
resources, wants to exploit them for
its benefit while limiting the tradi-
tional power of the national
government

S&Ls got sweet-
heart deals

Senior officials in Washing-
ton knew as long ago as 1988 that
preferential treatment was being
given to some troubled savings and
loan institutions whose senior exec-
utives were also on government
regulatory boards, according to
newly revealed documents.

In one example a director of
the Federal Home Loan Bank in
Dallas, who was also a savings
executive, received a $1.5 million
mortgage loan from a_ troubled
institution at the same time that
local examiners were being “influ-
enced improperly by senior offi-
cials” of the home loan bank.

According to reviews con-
jucted from 1986 to 1989 by out-
side government examiners at 10

districts of the Federal Home Loan
bank system, documents show that
senior regulators at the bank board
knew that in three of the larger dis-
tricts “losses were deliberately con-
cealed by the thrifts with the
approval” of local examiners.

The University of Illinois at

keep their mascot following
charges that the mascot was a racist

decades. Recently, some students

the “chief” was objectionable. The

FDA OKs new
cancer therapy

The Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) on Tuesday approved
a highly experimental treatment for
advanced cancer, which involves
infusing patients with genetically
altered blood

The blood cells, custom-
designed to target and destroy
tumors, contain the gene for a
potent enzyme that has been shown
to dissolve bulging tumors within
hours after application on labora-
tory animals.

With this last hurdle cleared,
Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the
National Cancer Institute, head
researcher for the project, plans to
begin testing the therapy on three
cancer patients suffering from met-
astatic melanoma, a deadly skin
malignancy that resists virtually all
conventional forms of treatment,
like chemotherapy and radiation.
Without the experimental treat-
ment, the patients are expected to
live no longer than two or three
months.

Rosenberg said that he is
“chomping at the bit to get started
on this.”

into the curriculum. Can we tell
them that we have made a commit-
ment to do that?’ And the General
Education Council said ‘yes, this in
some form will be part of our pro-
posed general education program’.”

The need for students to ven-
ture outside their worlds at to
obtain a well-rounded education,
necessitates the Council’s proposal,
according to Gerdes. The proposal
is “something which meets our mis-
sion as an institution, and to ade-
quately prepare for the world out-
side the Bucknell bubble,” said
Gerdes.

Although the Council has
Proposed several ways to increase
students’ perspective, the freshmen
foundation seminars lie at its core.
Gerdes defined these seminars as
“a pilot program right now but
one which we hope to recommend
as a program for all freshmen. As
instructors design those courses
they have to build in multiple per-
spectives in the same topic. Some-
times, the way they do that[increase
perspective] in this course isn’t
going to be directly related to race,
gender and multicutlure areas
because they might say that you
can learn to take different perspec-
tives on the same topic. But the
intellectual skill is the same —it is
saying there’s not just one way of
looking at it.”

The pilot program is basi-
cally a test of the criteria that the
Education Council has outlined. By
implementing a smaller number of
seminars, they feel it will allow
them to make revisions until the
whole proposal can eventually go
forward, and become widespread.

If the foundation seminars are lim-
ited to a size of fifteen, Gerdes esti-
mates that it would take about
forty-five seminars for a typical
freshman class in the College of
Arts and Sciences and about fifty-
seven, if the College of Engineer-
ing were included.[these numbers
are for the average class size at
Bucknell. The Class Of ‘94, for
instance, has a higher proportion of
Engineers and would probably
require closer to 47 seminars.]

The Council’s criteria for
foundation seminars espouse three
basic values: active leaming, con-
sciousness raising, and the develop-
ment of library and computer skills.
They focus on interdisciplinary top-
ics, which are somewhat revealed
by their course titles —"Religion
and Ecology,” and “Fiction,
Drama, and Film,” for example. In
all, eighteen freshmen seminars, or
“pilot courses,” are being offered
this semester.

Yet, Jackson Hill, associate
dean of Arts and Sciences, said
“The pilot courses that exist now
are not necessarily what these
courses are going to be. Foundation
Seminars will come to reflect what
the overall consensus shows they
should reflect. This is an evolution-
ary process. Nothing is engraved in
stone.”

Don’t be surprised, however,
is some of these ‘new’ Freshmen
Foundation Seminars sound famil-
iar. For some seminars are actually
the same courses which have been
offered during the past three years.
“The Many Worlds of Women,” for
instance, appears on this fall’s
course listing but was also offered
in 1989 and 1986. Another course,

The Bucknellian

“Accommodating Error,” was also
offered in 1987 and in 1986.

While some courses are
totally different , some seminars are
the same courses that have been
redesigned. “They have all under-
gone some transformation or evolu-
tion,” Hill explained. Hill said “the
foundation seminars are broader in
concept that the Freshmen Advisor
Seminar(FAS), as _ originally
defined, was.

The foundation seminars
attempts to broaden the goals of
FAS. The older seminars didn’t
have to meet the goals of the foun-
dation seminars...these goals were
Not part of the coterie”.

“The terms of the petition
are very amenable to the outlook of
the council itself,” according to
Hill, and the terms reenforce the
council’s own ideas. Ironically, the
committee who drafted this petition
does not view the Council’s goals
as amenable to their own.

“Obviously, Bucknell is set
up to limit student input,” said Ste-
phen Leshinski ‘91, a member of
this petition committee. “You have
over 1300 people sign a petition
and how many of those people have
had an input in curriculum
changes? You have a group of stu-
dents here who represent one-half,
one-third, or one-fourth of the stu-
dents who worked on putting that
petition together, and how many of
us knew that a group was doing
that and what was going on? That’s
not a criticism of the people, that’s
a criticism of the way it is set up.”

The aims of the petition,
according to its members, were
two-fold. First, it sought to create
an environment of cultural diversity

by expanding the curriculum. Sec-
ondly, the petition was intended to
show that there were a group of stu-
dents who wanted to directly get
involved in that process. The com-
mittee agrees that the University
has failed in achieving this latter
goal; that is, in not including any of
the students who wished to be
included.

Another committee member
said “The General Education Coun-
cil turned to the Bucknell Student
Government to provide them with
two student representatives, and the
BSG provided them, whereas it
would have been more wise to tum
to the entire campus, to tum to
other groups. The BSG does not
represent the student body; it repre-
sents a portion of the student body.

Hill explained that the Edu-
cation Council’s process of exclud-
ing these groups was not due to
“any lack of desire to have those
discussions” but rather, due to time
constraints by the Council to get
things done. Hill, said that a
“broader network of opinion” is not
part of the University’s structure,
and he suggested that perhaps
Charlotte Weddle, associate vice-
president for student life, address
this communication gap.

Nonetheless, a verbal com-
munication between students and
the Council will begin on Novem-
ber 28, when Professor Elaine Gar-
rett, the Chair of the General Edu-
cation Council, meets with this
student committee. Also, on
December 4, the committee is
invited to the Education Council’s
meeting.

Petition urging a
diverse curriculum

Editor's Note: The following petition was distributed last April
and was signed by about 1300 students. In May, the students then
handed their petition to the dean’ s office.

We, the undersigned, strongly urge the administration and faculty
to implement the following policies for the 1991/92 academic year in
order to develop the University’s campaign for cultural diversity:

1) With student input, develop a program to be incorporated
within the University’s distributional humanities, social science, and
natural science requirements that encompasses non-Western, African-
American, Women’s Jewish, and Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual studies, begin-
ning with the incoming first year students of Fall 1991

2) Add more courses to the curriculum in non-Western, African-
American, Women’s, Jewish, and Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual Studies by the

1991/92 academic year.

3) Hire an adequate number of faculty who have expertise in
non-Western, African-American, Women’s, Jewish, and Gay/Lesbian/
Bisexual Studies by the 1991/92 academic year. These new faculty
members need to be placed in tenure-track positions.

4) All members of faculty, staff, and administration need to be
strongly encouraged to attend biannual seminars or workshops aimed at
increasing their sensitivity and awareness about race, gender, class,
sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and ethnicity.

5) The University must provide the proper funding for the afore-

mentioned policies.

STOP

From page I

According to Larson, the
group already has opposition. A
phone call to the Langone Center
Office described the grave display
as “un-American.” But Larson
responded, “If America is supposed
to be a democracy and a free soci-
ety, it’s not only our right but our
duty to stand for what we believe
in.”

STOP has several events
planned for the coming week. Fri-
day Nov. 16 will feature classroom
discussions all day. There will be a
“Teach In” Saturday from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. at the LC Forum. Sunday
there will be a Candlelight Vigil at
4:45 p.m. at Rooke Chapel. On
Monday there will be a “Speak
Out” at 11:45 a.m. on the uphill
side of the Langone Center.

Editor’s note:

The candidates for BSG executive offices were interviewed by

members of the Bucknellian staff on Tuesday
office were asked a series of questions

Candidates for each
The questions were not

available to the candidates prior to the interview.

Candidates for president

Bill Lee ‘93
Experience:

“| was student body president of
my high school... and one of the
hardest thing for me was to be
fair with different student organi-
zations. | think | can bring that
experience into the BSG. | know
there's been a problem this year
of impartiality and voicing differ
ent student organization. | like
to be fair and just in the way
BSG makes decisions for the
student body

“I'd like to make BSG a liaison
between student body and the
administration.”

Goals:

“The way the BSG is currently
structured on campus, it’s kind
of like a triangle with the BSG
officers on top, the congress
men in the middle, and the stu-
dent body on the bottom. | see
a problem with that. BSG needs
to be an organization that sup-
ports student voices, different
organizations, and try to push
§hat within the University and
the administration.”

“Also, I'd like to get BSG
involved in more student activi
ties and student organizations
on campus by trying to repre-
sent every organization on cam-
pus, maybe send congressmen
to their meetings, see and find
out what they’re about, so we
can make a fair judgement on
them during appropriations and
other times we have to make a
judgement on any — student
organization.”

Student apathy/
communication with
administration:

“The word apathy is used a lot,
and | think that’s wrong because
you're kind of blaming the stu-
dents and saying that they're
apathetic about certain things. |
think it has to do with involve-
ment and enthusiasm and that
has to do with the different stu-
dent leaders at Bucknell.”

“I'd like to set BSG up so we
can meet formally with adminis-
tration more often than we have
this year and the years before.
The administration says one
thing and then they present
another and that’s where stu-
dents feel they're powerless.

Students do have a voice on
campus, and | want every stu-
dent to express it. We have to
provide a place and a time for
them to do that.”

Salient issues:

“Students are obviously unsatis-
fied with the alcohol policy. but |
don't think is the most important
issue. | think that issue derives
from lack of social functions
beside the Greek system. Stu-
-dents really don't have a place
to turn to beside the fraternity
“and sorority parties. The univer-
. sity says they will provide more,
but | don’t see it happening,
unless this new Bison is going
to provide every function people
‘can attend.”
*“| also see Bucknell students
"graduating, doing fine with their
- GPA and their major, but | don't
; think they're intellectual in terms
»of what's going on around the

:

world. I'd like to build a commu-
nity where people are more
intellectual in what's going on in
the world

The student government needs
to bring that up on campus,
bring up issues for people do
debate, learn about different
issues, and be educated.”

Why running:

| feel like | can change a lot of
things on campus. To me this is
a challenge. | have to work with
the town, the administration, the
students, and bring them all
together. I'd like to bring the
BSG back to what the Hand-
book says it should be: ‘to repre-
sent all aspects of siudent life.’
| don't think it's doing that. |
think it should be fair, bring jus-
tice into the school, and
increase participation.”

Alex Sherer ‘93
Experience:

“Ive been on BSG since first
semester freshman year; this
semester l've worked closely
with the current president, I've
been attending the executive
meeting weekly; Also I'm spear-
heading a committee which i s
developing a student evaluation
booklet of the professors which
should be coming out next
semester for first semester next
year. |'m also on the appropria-
tions committee. | have experi-
ence in all facets of BSG. |
think it's very important as presi-
dent to have prior experience
before taking office. | also am
extremely aware of the commit-
tees around BSG. | do have a
lot of experience with BSG
currently.”

Goals:

“One of the biggest things is the
social situation at Bucknell, and
| don’t mean just Greek. | think
a big problem with the BSG is
that many students are really
unaware of what the BSG does.
| think that was evident in the
situation with the appropriations
committee... | think it was just a
lack of communication.”

“| would like to have more pub-
licity given to the BSG, and I'd
like to invite the heads of vari-
ous groups on campus [to
attend BSG meetings].”

“I'd like to maybe to hold forums
if certain topics came up and
just raise campus awareness.”

“| would like to work with the
administration and the students
and the heads of organizations
and work out a plan of action.”

Student morale/
communication with
administration:

“| think there is a low morale
due to students unhappiness
with some of the rules, but | also
think it's just a lack of communi-
Cation in general and if the stu-
dents are aware of what's going
on and what groups are doing
what they can become better
involved and if the students and
the administration work together
| think that's important.”

Salient issues:

“Morale is obviously a major

The Bucknellian

problem, the unhappiness with
the Act 31 reforms and related
issues, one recurring theme is
the parking situation, which isn't
a top priority but does deserve
some attention.”

“Unrest with the social reforms
is apparently the most pressing
issue on campus.”

Why running:

“| have involvement with the
BSG, and | think it's important to
get someone on there who has
experience before hand. | cer-
tainly have certain goals that I'd
like to see put into effect.”

“By running for this position |
can hopefully get an upward
trend, raise morale, and hope-
fully put into effect certain
reforms that the students would
like to see.”

Candidate for first
vice president

Megan Karakelian ‘93
Experience:

“I've been a part of a lot of differ-
ent activities and a lot of differ-
ent groups on campus |
haven't worked directly with the
student government before,
except through the lectureship
committee and the concert com-
mittee which I'm on I've
worked with various sports
teams and the dance company.”

“And I've kind of had a well-
rounded view of how different
organizations and different fac-
ets of Bucknell work.”

“I've had leadership positions
before, never at Bucknell
directly, but | think | can give a
lot do it.”

Goals:

“I'd like to work with Joey [Krak-
off, current 1st vice-president] to
continue what he’s done as far
as elections. Personally I'd like
to make BSG more reachable
for the students. | want some-
how to work with the others who
will be the new officers and try
to make it easier for everyone
else at Bucknell to get in touch
and use BSG for themselves.”

“| don't think that a lot of people
know that Bucknell and BSG
should be together, and every-
one here is a part of it.”

Student morale/
communication with
administration:

“| can't personally say all the
answers right now, but | think a
lot of it has to do with the teach-
ers too; if we could work with
the teachers to try to reach the
students. Also let the students
know that the teachers are
reachable.”

“Hopefully by inviting the admin-
istration to more meetings with
students and having individual
groups invite the administration
in and talking to them...if the stu-
dents could deal directly with
the administration it would help
a lot.”

“It may put pressure on the
administration to try to under-
stand that the students are talk-
ing about, and it might give the
students a better idea of what
the administration is going
through, and how difficult it is for
them to stand on that thin line.”

Questions to all Candidates:
e If elected, what experience will you bring to your office?

e What are your goals for your term in office?

e In light of the recent student morale problerns on campus, how will
you work to facilitate communication between the BSG and the

administration?

November 16, 1990

e What do you see as the most salient issues facing the student body
and how will you move to address them?
e Why are you running?

For the candidates for treasurer, the third question above was replaced by

the following:

e How will you work to ensure the appropriations process is fair and

equitable?

Salient issues:

“The most important issue in my
eyes is the diversity here. It's a
very group-oriented campus; it’s
not integrated at all. | think
that's a problem. It doesn't
seem like there's many courses
focused on African studies, or
studies of foreign people,
there’s not a lot of cultural
studies...”

‘To learn about all the issues
that seem so far from us at
Bucknell.”

Why running:

‘| used to always get involved
student government, and | enjoy
it a lot. | enjoy talking with stu-
dents, | enjoy dealing with the
administrators and professors,
and I’m starting to become more
active in more groups oriented
towards the problems | talked
about with the diversity...”

| think there’s a lot that can be
done. I’ve been getting a feel
for how everyone else thinks
and | really want to be a part of
trying to mold Bucknell and try-
ing to work to make the student
government more of an outlet
for the students.”

Candidates for sec-
ond vice president

Chris Zacharda ‘93
Experience:

“With leadership skills, I'm cur-
rently in the pilot program of the
emerging leaders. I’m currently
a congressman on BSG, which
would definitely help because
I've seen how it works, I've seen
the job of second vice president,
what the current second vice
president does. | see her time
constraints, the things she's
devoted to, and thing like that.”

“I've had leadership roles in my
fraternity and in the inter-
fraternity council, I'm a pre-law
major, I’m very into politics, | like
the legal aspects of issues, and
| think I'd be able to draw from
that.”

Goals:

“Since the office of second vice
president is largely correspon-
dence, one way | think | could
improve the entire output of
Bucknell Student Government
would be to definitely improve
communications between the
students and the organization
that his there for the students.”

“Posting things such as the min-
utes of the meetings, things to
be voted on, things to be dis-
cussed, agendas.. making them
more public to the students, |
think that would largely help
break the communication gap,
making sure the know our meet-

ings are open, | think that’s the
biggest problem we're facing
right now: a bridge of the com-
munication gap would help.”

Student morale/
communication with
administration:

“Since the student government
is a liaison between the stu-
dents and the administration
being put on the executive coun-
cil of BSG would give even
more of a position to confront
with administration.”

“With me really being in favor of
bridging the communication gap
it would definitely help to inform
that administration of the stu-
dents’ needs, and also being the
secretarial liaison between the
government and the administra-
tion | would definitely from a per-
sonal point of view, | would be
able to know exactly what was
going on.”

Salient issues:

“Communication is definitely a
big problem, and combating the
communication problem could
also help alleviate other prob-
lems such as student morale.”

“| really don’t think administra-
tion is aware of any problems
that the students have, so that’s
another thing that BSG could
do.”

“The chalk talk issue, that was
rather highly debated, definitely
brought more attention to the
students on the issue. We're
also trying to have more BSG
members sit on other commit-
tees, and have other commit-
tees have individuals go to
BSG meetings, which would
make the communication lines
between the specific organiza-
tions and the government much
more efficient.”

Why running:

“Originally | was running
because | was afraid of the apa-
thy that the students were facing
and that they were displaying by
not having anyone run.”

“| really feel the need to bridge
the communication gap, and |
feel that being the second vice
president would be a major role
in that gap. Especially, | felt that
sitting on the executive council
and being a liaison to adminis-
tration more specifically than
representatives that | could
probably make even more of a
difference.”

Mare Rasmussen ‘93
Experience:

“I'm serving on the committee
on women’s leadership, so I've
worked with the staff of OSA,
and some of the administrators,
namely Mary Dorsey, so | do

know some of the functions of
the administrative side of
Bucknell.”

“| am also the chairperson for
the committee on logistics for
the women's leadership confer-
ence that we are holding in the
spring.”

“I'm not sure that | really have
like ‘experience’ that would
apply to this position.”

“| know that | do have a of of
enthusiasm and | would like to
do my best for the students.”

Goals:

‘I'd like to bring BSG back to the
students. Yeah, sure, people
know that BSG is the Bucknell
Student Government, but they
don’t know that it does actually
have a huge impact on life here
at Bucknell.”

“| think the function of BSG
should be what the students
want it to be, and if there’s any-
way | can help... | think that’s
what I'd like to do.”

Student morale/
communication with
administration:

“Well | know that the BSG has
tried before to have liaison offi-
cers between the congress and
the different organizations on
campus. And apparently that
hasn't worked.”

‘| think it’s congress’ duty to get
to know what the students want
and I'm not exactly sure how do
to that except maybe possibly
through just increasing student
Participation in government.”

Salient Issues:

‘| guess it all ties into Morale in
a way, and then there’s the
whole Greek situation, which
gets turned into the alcohol situ-
ation when it should just be the
way the student body is
assembled.”

Why running:

“To be honest with you, I’m not
sure. | know that | want to do
something for Bucknell. i}
thought that if | could run for
second vice president in a role
that was vague | could try to
turn it into something that might
not be so vague, and maybe do
something for the apathy,

morale, and separatism and stu-
dent participation, etc.”

Candidates for
treasurer

Dave Fries ‘93
Experience:

“BSG congressman for the past
two years. During that time |
spent 1 semester as special
assistant to the president, 1
semester as special assistant to
the treasurer. Last semester |
served on the executive commit-
tee and this semester | served
on appropriations; appropria-
tions being a key in terms of
being treasurer mostly because
| got to see the questions the
actual probing that the current
treasurer went through in terms
of giving out money.”

Goals:

“As treasurer, it would be ideal
for me to get an appropriations
committee that’s very diversi-
fied. I'd want many multi-culture
students on the committee,
men and women, people from
different clubs, so that there
aren't any biases.”

“| foresee myself being an
impartial leader, and a prober,
going through policies like
probed allocation, making sure
you know where the money
goes. You don't want to be a
big miser with it, but on the
other hand frivolity | don’t think
is what you want to do either.
Because it is the students’
money and they have the right
to know where it goes, nothing
should be funded just so some-
one else can have a really good
time.”

“The treasurer has a voice on
the executive committee. Basi-
cally when you have your exec
utive committee meetings twice
a week the treasurer is seen as
an equal; he doesn't have to
stay just with monetary policy
but he’s someone who can shed
light on pretty much anything.”

Fairness in appropriations:

“In terms of improvement just to
get a more diversified commit-
tee so that no one could actually
accuse you of something like
that. | think that’s key here;
you're able to cover yourself a
little.”

“It also brings in different voices.

lf we don't have any multi-
culture students on the appropri-
ations committee right now, and
| don't believe we do, you don't
get to hear the pros and cons of
why funding should go to some-
thing like that because no one
else can draw upon it and say
‘yeah, | went to that event last
year and it was really worth-
while, | think we should help
fund it again this year.”

“Another thing is that, for some
of the groups that come in, their
budgets aren't done properly.

You have to give out proper
guidelines. Some groups will
come in and want twenty-three
hundred dollars and only end up
getting a hundred and it's not
because we don't like them...

It's just because they're so neb-
ulous in what they write down.

They say ‘conference with lec-
turer, $1500’ but they don't have
a speaker yet, they don't’ have a
place yet, but they need the
money up front. We just can’t
give that money out up front.”

Salient issues:

“| see morale as a pretty salient
issue. | think it’s getting better.

| don't think the students are def-
initely wholly at fault, nor is the
administration. | guess in terms
of morale | see the relaxing of
social rules helping out, Vince
DeCerchio coming in and seem-
ing to take a more hands-off
approach in his governing of par-
ties and allowing fraternities to
basically govern themselves.”

“Other problems more specific to
my job is appropriations where a
lot of groups feel that they're get-
ting the shaft somehow and so
I'd like to see the appropriations
become more diversified so peo-
ple not only wouldn't have that
complaint, but that maybe we’d
be able to allocate more if we
knew what it’s for. | think ignor-
ance may have a lot to do with
why some of these clubs aren't
getting money, just because the
people on the committee right
now don’t know and aren't sure
about why we should give
money to certain events
because they haven't gone
through it If someone were
there on the committee that
could help us out and tell us
more about the event we might
be more willing to hand money
out.”

Why running:

“!'m running because | want to
be that person, | guess. The
impartial leader to appropria-
tions. | think | can do it, I've
been special assistant to the
treasurer, it seems like fun.”

“I'd like to ask the probing ques-
tions. Ask them if they should

The

charge dues... | see it as a job
that I'd like to take on. Being in
congress the last two years,
I've seen the previous treasur-
ers, and it looks like a job I'd
enjoy.”

Vanessa Mayo ‘93
Experience:

“Well, I'm treasurer for two
clubs at the moment, so I've
had some experience this
semester working with appro-
priations. | have a pretty good
understanding of how BSG
government works through the
clubs I’m associated with and
all the issues I've been involved
in for the last couple of years at
Bucknell. I've been on commit-
tees and groups and held lead-
ership positions here; nothing
directly pertaining to BSG.”

Goals:
“| think a lot of people don't

understand very well how
appropriations works at Buck-

Bucknellian

nell. | think a lot of it has to do
with groups not understanding
how to ask for money, what
they should be asking for.”

“I'd like to make it a lot easier
for treasurers of clubs, and the
student body to know where
their money is going.”

Why running:

“| think there’s a lot of potential
for BSG to do a lot on this cam-
pus, and | know they've been
trying. | guess | just want to
continue trying to get BSG
more involved with the students.
and get the students to know
more about it. | think a lot of
people are screaming about

community right now and that
we have none, and I'd like to
help do something about that
and | think the best way is
through BSG.”

Fairness in appropriations:

“| think it's important that there
should be someone groups
could go to to voice their aggra-
vations with appropriations. |
think there should be someone
who's not involved directly with
the appropriations system who
could have an unbiased view of
what’s happening.”

Salient issues:

“| think community is a big prob-

page. 7

lem right now. Students don't
feel like they have the power to
get anything done, and | think
that leads to the problem of
community. Most students who
come to Bucknell have had
leadership positions and have
been involved before they
come here and for some rea-
son when they get here that all
falls apart and they lose all
interest in being involved. |
don’t think that’s a problem with
all the students who come
here; | would have to say it’s a
problem in the system. I'd like
to try to figure out what that
problem is.”

ROTC

From page 3

it is not evident to me that we will
see a change in that policy any time
soon.”

Until that time when there
is a change in policy Mclver said
that he was bound to separate any
student contacted to the Army
through ROTC if he finds him or
her to be homosexual.

At other universities such
as MIT, Tufts, and Brown, students
engaged in protests against
ROTC’s connection with their insti-
tutions which resulted in these uni-
versities separating themselves
from their respective ROTC pro-
grams. Larson stated that the group
of students examining these issues
were not that far along yet.

“T don’t think we are at the
point to ask the question of whether

ROTC should be phased out, but at

the same time we are not going to
limit our options,” Larson said. “As
a committee we stand for the rights
of gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual stu-
dents and we will not back down
from that.”

Sojka said that at present
the University’s legal counsel,
Elias Abelson, had not been asked
to begin work on this issue. Bar-
bara Shailor, the University’s affir-
mative action officer, has begun to
look at relevent materials, accord-
ing to Sojka, in the event that there
is an uproar over the ROTC issue
any time soon. As of yet, though,

the University does not have a firm
stance on how it understands its
relationship to ROTC.

Larson stated that in orga-
nizing this examination of the
ROTC policy involving gays and
lesbians he was not making any
statement concerning the ROTC
program itself or the military. “Our
goal,” Larson said, “is to make
Bucknell a safe environment for
students of all sexual orientations
so that all students can feel comfort-
able being themselves and there is
no need to hide a part of

Bison Tales

By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

Here at Bucknell, clothing has different levels of cleanliness.
There are the level one (desirable) clothes which are so “neat”,
“clean”, and well...."morning fresh” that the little cuddly teddy bear
from that fabric softener commercial (named Cutsie or Snuggly or
something like that) will spend playful hours frolicking amongst your
sweatshirts and letting out heart warming-giggles while he announces
how soft and wonderful he thinks your clothing is. (By the way, is it
true that that for just 40 bucks and 23 proof of purchases, you can
own a genuine imitation of that lovable bear? Oh boy!) People usu-
ally wear level one clothes on tough days of lab because it is some-
what less depressing to face a 7 hour dissection knowing that at least
your clothes don’t smell of formaldehyde. . . yet. Then (after 17 or 18
uses) there is level ten. Although these fetid mounds may at one time
have been “sparkling clean”, now they have started to develop a
strange decaying odor and scem to resist slightly when you pull them
from the floor. However, you can still use this clothing provided you
put on lots of cologne and possess a spatula to scrape the outfit off
your body at the end of the day. After you have abused all your
pants, shirts, and socks a number of times at level 10, (and they have
developed a stench that would make Snuggly want to drown himself
in a big vat of Wisk) you can then reluctantly toss everything into the
hamper where it chemically bonds together and develops into a fab-
ric-based life form with a primitive digestive system capable of con-
suming, . . stuffed bears that like to frolic amongst sweatshirts.

When it looks like your clothing supply has been exhausted do
not despair. There a number of people on this campus who are selling
high quality event-oriented tee-shirts which display artistic and origi-
nal designs. My favorite are the fraternity “theme party” shirts that
depict lovable and popular comic strip characters (like Charlie
Brown) chugging beer, funnelling margaritas, and generally passing
out at their favorite places to party. For the past week, my two
“theme party” shirts have become the highlight of my wardrobe
(along with the jeans rapidly approaching level 27) however, I am
relatively unconcerned about this, because in just 4 days I will be
wrestling the fearsome pile into a pillow-case and heading home for
Thanksgiving break with some special surprises for mom and dad to
wash and fold.

Actually, I don’t know why I’m so excited about Thanksgiving
holiday. Last year, it seemed that my newfound college worldliness
and wisdom effected my ability to communicate with relatives who
had come up to visit. I noticed this during my first conversation with
my great aunt...

Blanche: (rushing up to me) oyyyyy my little baby come here and
tell your Aunt all about college!

Me: (flinching as I receive a lip-stick soaked kiss on the cheek) Hi
Aunt Blanche, how are you, it’s been such a...

Blanche: (reproachfully) Honey, why are you wearing a shirt that
shows Snoopy vomiting on Woodstock?

Me: Well, I was like ‘scoping’...’yeah scope’....but I had like
‘bagel’ to wear so I felt like ‘booting’ cause I wasn’t gone a
‘scrog’ so I ‘sleazed’ it for ten bucks. Eeeeeeceeeewah!

Blanche: That’s nice honey...Have your bowels been troubling
you?

After assuring Aunt Blanche that my bowels really were fine,
and promising her I’d notify her know if there was any change in
their status, I headed downstairs to greet my two younger cousins.
Jay was in fourth grade and Jonathon was in sixth. My most recent
memories of these two were from four years ago when Jonathon
would quietly play with his He-Man doll and Jay enjoyed singing
adorable songs from his first-grade class. I was surprised to note just
how much my cute little cousins had changed...

Me: Hey guys! Remember Me?!? Ya Wanna play Transformers
or Go-Bots?!?

Jonathon: Dude, are you a virgin?

Me: Hey, maybe we can build forts!...or do a water gun
fight!...or roll down the hill!...or jump on the couch! I
know! We can watch “The Litthe Mermaid!” I'll bet Jay
knows all the songs!

Jay: What kind of condoms do you use, man?

LE You mean there’s a difference?

Jonathon: Sit down dude, we’ ll explain...

That night I curled up in fetal position and clutched my teddy
bear, ‘Snuggly’...he was a bargain.

Sophomore helped the disabled

Sophomore Jessica Mahalin-

working as a counselor at a camp
for disabled children and adults, a
job that required a lot of patience
and determination. She spent this

“Tt really changed my attitude

It's that time again...
Cross your fingers and vote

In an attempt to elucidate the issues and reduce the popularity aspect of the Bucknell Student Government
(BSG) elections process, The Bucknellian's editorial board decided to interview and endorse candidates this
semester

While the board is generally disappointed with the quality and quantity of candidates running for office, we ;

feel that the following candidates will push the BSG into a strong role on campus while best representing the
entire student body

President

Alex Sherer ’93 will bring a wealth of experience to the executive board of the BSG. Having been a con-
gressman for the past year and special assistant to current BSG President Dave Skena ’92 this semester, Sherer
knows the methods, both good and bad, of BSG.

Sherer admits to the obvious problems with the appropriations process, and will swiftly move to address
them. He also recognizes the rift of communication between the student body and BSG — a rift that he believes
must be bridged.

First Vice President

Megan Karakelian ’93 will bring diversity to BSG. Having been involved in a wide variety of activities at
Bucknell, Karakelian’s focus is on creating a more diverse Bucknell. She sees curriculum changes, a new role for
BSG in activism and communication as key aspects of the new executive board.

Karakelian, like Sherer, believes that the BSG must become more reachable. BSG, she asserts, must return
to the student body and be truly representative.

Second Vice President

Chris Zacharda ’93 has demonstrated that he does what is in the students’ best interest. Having held the
position of congressman, Zacharda understands the sometimes obscure processes and procedures of student gov-
emment. He believes strongly in honest government, and wants to see a new, revitalized BSG that “is in tune
with the feelings of’students.”

Zacharda has a firm grasp on the most important issues, and has proven that he is conerned with both an
honest and representative BSG

Treasurer

Dave Fries '93 will be an invaluable asset to both students and the executive board of BSG. A stellar candi-
date, Fries possesses the intellectual ability, integrity and pure energy necessary for an effective student govern-
ment. As special assistant to current Treasurer Scott Searle 92, Fries has recognized both the shortcomings and
good aspects of the current appropriations process.

Fries, unlike other candidates, has formulated a valid platform and plan of attack. He will move to imple-
ment a fair and equitable appropriations process, while evaluating other, larger aspects of BSG which he feels
need reform

Fries is the most promising candidate running for office, and is the most stongly endorsed of all of the
candidates

Troops need our support

To the Editor:

As more troops are being
deployed to the Middle East and
the threat of war is imminent, the
whispers of dissent are growing
louder. Students on campus are
distributing gold ribbons in sup-
port of S.T.O.P. (Students and
Teachers Organizing for Peace),
and displaying mock grave sites
for the soldiers who have died as
a result of training mission
accidents.

Our presence in the Gulf is
not simply a matter of how much
oil we have to use. If Saddam
Hussein controls oil, then he con-
trols the world’s economy. If he
controls the world’s economy,
then he will control us politically,
which would effect our everyday
lives and our personal freedom
that we Americans have enjoyed
for over 200 years.

Saddam Hussein would like
to emerge as an Arab world
leader; thus, controlling oil and
the Arab nations. He then would
have a greater power base than
the United States and the Soviet
Union, the world leaders today.

The danger of Hussein being on a
par with the world leaders is that
he knows only to “rule by the
sword”. Everyone of the Arab
states, whether monarchial, secu-
lar, or religious, has come to power
through blood. Iraq does not have
the constitutional framework that
constrains a ruthless leader. Huss-
ein controlling oil threatens our
lives.

Iraq is a country tribal in
nature because they’ ve needed to
survive in the desert for thousands
of years. They live by the philoso-
phy, “rule or die”; one man
triumphs while the other weeps.
Hussein acts as a tribal leader
when he tries to pull the Arab
nations together for a common
cause. He behaves like a brutal dic-
tator when he kills his own people,
putting one Arab against another.
Hussein is also perceived as a
modemizing president when he
provides new technology—
schools, hospitals, roads, buildings,
etc. —in the growing cities of Iraq.
Depending on which role is most
important to survive and be in
power, Saddam Hussein will move
cleverly and comfortably between

any of the three.

President Bush has sent
troops to the Middle East to
oppose further aggression and in
defense of oil, which in the hands
of Hussein would cripple the
world’s economy. We must sup-
port Bush and the men and
women of Operation Desert
Shield. These men and women
need to know that America is
behind them.

Quoting a Marine Captain
in the Persian Gulf in a letter to
his brother back home: “Tell eve-
ryone who cares that everyone
out here appreciates all the sup-
port. I can honestly say that one
of the prime reasons most people
are enduring out here is because
everyone at home supports us.
It’s the only known quantity that
keeps you going when the end is
an unknown and not in sight.
Without public support, visible
public support, morale out here
would collapse and this whole
thing would get very ugly very
fast.”

ST.OP. protests US actions

To the Editor:

The organization S.T.O.P.
(Students and Teachers Organized
for Peace) constructed a mock
memorial cemetery uphill of the
Langone Center earlier this week.
We are mourning the loss of fifty-
four American soldiers already
killed last week in the Persian Gulf.
These soldiers were killed not in
combat, but in accidents and routine
drills being performed as a part of
the United States’ role in this
region. Presumably these soldiers
would still be alive if they were not
in the Persian Gulf. In the upcoming
weeks, possibly days, unless wide-
spread national and international
resistance is expressed, many more
people will die.

As you walked by the tomb-
stones, did you laugh? Did you
think it was a joke? Did you feel
horror? Were you angered by the
challenge to the United States’
actions? Did you feel sorrow? Were
you relieved to know resistance to
military involvement in the Gulf
does exist?

Did you know that fifty-four
people had really died? Fifty-four
families in the United States are

feeling the pain of struggling with
this loss, for what? You should
think about these people—the peo-
ple who knew them think about
them every day because they are
dead. Is it worth it to you to lose a
brother, father, sister, son, daughter?

Did you feel anything? You
should have.

Are you prepared to lose your
own life?

That tombstone could belong
to you next November, or even ear-
lier. Many Bucknell students do not
know that it is very possible you
may die should the United States
become a leading player in an war
with Iraq. Whether a war against
Iraq becomes another Vietnam or a
far worse war in terms of losses, the
potential for another draft does
exist. In 1971 the Congress
amended the draft climinating past
deferments for college men. The
1971 Amendment to the Military
Selective Service Act, section 456
“Deferments and exemptions from
training and service” was amended
as follows:

“Any person who while satis-
factorily pursuing a full-time course
of instruction at a college, univer-
sity, or similar institution is ordered

As members of the Rooke Chapel Choir, we would like
to make a few comments regarding the November 2, 1990
review of our performance of Acis and Galatea. A few incon-
sistencies (which we would like to correct) were presented.

In the future, we would appreciate concert reviewers
who are capable of arriving at the performance on time. Had
Ms. Myrom arrived even seconds before the beginning of the
performance, she would have known that the credited bass
soloist, John Ostendorf, was unable to perform, and that
Nathaniel Watson sang the part of Polyphemus instead. Also,
while credits and praise are certainly due Handel for his mag-
nificent work, we hope this was not the only reason our audi-
ence responded “positively.” ;

would have been a bit perturbed if it had been suggested
that she wear a Chorale dress. We resent the mention of

work deserve something more than a fashion report.

In response to Ms. Myrom’s comment about the lack
of scenery, props or action: Handel composed Acis and
Galatea as a chamber opera, as it was presented last
month. He asks us to use our imagination as we focus on
the music; it could hardly have been expected that Gray-

Sincerely,

had developed distinct styles each for his vocal writing and
his instrumental writing so that such a superficial comparison
between Acis and Galatea and Water Music is inaccurate. At
any rate, a composer such as Handel surely deserves to be

more dignified than a “sure-fire

This means that if a war

lege age men would only be allowed
to finish their current semester (sen-

service. Do you know how many
United States’ troops are in the Per-

we may go to war? Do you know if
you may get drafted next semester?

people, maybe you, die.

S.T.O.P. strongly opposes the
United States’ military role and is
organizing support for pulling
United States’ troops out of the Per-
sian Gulf. We believe that although
the crisis in the Persian Gulf is seri-
ous and does present legitimate
problems for our country, these
problems do not justify or merit the
loss of lives or any form of war. We
challenge every individual on this
campus to educate his or herself
about the conflict, our country’s
role, and possible alternatives to
military action. We believe that
alternatives do exist to military
involvement. The United States has
pursued only three months of diplo-
macy before resorting to military
action.

BIO should accept the
realities of budgeting

By Mark Leister

Last week’s article in The
Bucknellian explaining Bucknell
International Organization (BIO)’s
attempt to secure its proposed bud-
get for this year, spurred me to
examine this issue more deeply. I
could hardly believe that this
organization was claiming (1) to be
the only social activity on campus
that its members enjoy, and (2) that
the BSG had left them so finan-
cially deprived that they would
probably be forced to disband.

Assessing the situation in the
very best possible light for BIO,
one can agree with their sentiments
that only receiving about 35% of
your proposal can be disheartening.
Most organizations would require
widespread monetary changes to
function on a budget slashed to that
degree. However, upon further
perusal, many amusing problems
with both BIO and its budget begin
to surface.

First, how many people does
the organization really have? The
estimated 250 sounds highly
inflated. I’ve heard estimates that
put BIO’s Activities Fair sign-up
list at approximately that number,
but most people on this campus
know that this number does not rep-
resent actual weekly turn-out. Logi-
cally, the Appropriations Commit-
tee, having seen little evidence of
such a drastic increase (70 to 250)
in membership, placed the burden
of proof upon BIO and was swayed
by their lack thereof.

Second, BIO claims that its
members are students who are not
involved with any other organiza-
tions. Therefore, BIO’s members
are not reaping the benefits of their
$100 activities fee, because they
are getting such a small percentage.

The natural question arises:
whose fault is that? It is hardly the

fault of the BSG. This campus can-
not expect BSG to make sure each
and every student receives $100
worth of benefits from Bucknell’s
many organizations.

Rather, it is the individual
who must take charge by being
active and making sure that advan-
tage is taken of as many facets of
Bucknell as is possible.

But I am also a bit befuddled
as to why many of BIO’s members
are not involved with other organi-
zations. There should be an expla-
nation as to why these very diverse
BIO students, who are here to
enrich both themselves and (we
hope) the community, are segregat-
ing themselves into their own little
club. There is something very
wrong with that situation.

Finally, there is the actual
budget request which must be
examined. Apparently, the vast
majority (a rumored 90%) of BIO’s
proposed budget was for food.
There is a degree of audacity
required in requesting that the BSG
allocate funds for meals, when your
organization will not even charge
membership ducs.

Other organizations are fac-
ing cuts of truly necessary items in
their budgets, and BIO has the
brass to argue over food. If BIO
indeed has 250 members, dues of
$4 each would generate an extra
$1000—half of the actual budget—
and would take some of the burden
off of the BSG.

In conclusion, I am hopeful
that groups like BIO will begin to
look at the appropriations process
in a more realistic light. BSG will
do the best it can with its limited
funds, and until it is blessed with
bottomless coffers, student organi-
zations will have to act responsibly
with their monies and cooperate
within the system.

Freshman Forum

By Jim Joseph

Well, the day has finally come. The news was spread throughout
campus on fancy green and gold cards, buttons, and posters. I still
remember the day when I found that little card on my doorknob. What
a surprise to realize that the Gulf crisis wouldn’t delay the opening of
the new Bison any longer than today. You sec, for freshmen the new
Bison presents an interesting change. All we have heard are the leg-
ends about the old Bison and felt the sense of loss by not having a
Bison during our first year.

Of course, we do have the substitute on the second floor of the
UC, but the carefully decorated brown-carpeted walls probably won’t
match the new Bison. Storics of great pool games, video games and
even good food right here on the Bucknell University campus conjure
an unrealistic, even mythical image of the Bison for the freshmen. This
is going to be an important new aspect of our Bucknell experience: a
place to eat a good cheeseburger, a place to relax, a place to
procrastinate.

But beyond the simple activities found at the Bison, this will be a
new place for comedians or bands. The Bison will offer alternatives to
Bostwick meals, studying and boring dormitories. This will be an
entirely new side of Bucknell never experienced by first year students.
So, if you’re reading this article after 9 p.m. on Friday, November 16,
put it down and get over to the Bison and enjoy the music of “Y NOT”
and the comedy of Vic Henley. See you at the Bison! In a closing note,
I would like to say to everybody who read my article two weeks ago or
the response to it by the BAC last week that the BAC made a very
valid point. We do not have the right to complain about this if we are
not making any effort to change the problem. So I invite all of you, as
did the BAC in their response article, to attend their meeting this
Thursday, November 15 at 6 p.m. in room 219 of the UC.

S.T.O.P.

From page 10 to follow through articles, discus-
sions, and teach-ins. Whether you
agree with our beliefs or not, edu-

cate yourself on this crisis and its

sian Gulf crisis. I believe what our
country has done is wrong and

offensive and I will struggle to stop
the United States’ military actions.
We should all educate ourselves
and those of us against the war
should explore and use as many
means as possible to prevent its
occurrence. The crisis in the Gulf
requires long-term vision and non-
military action—such as maintain-
ing sanctions, diplomacy, de-
militarizing the conflict, and sup-
porting United Nations settling the
historical and on-going disputes
between the Persian Gulf countries.
These alternatives and others shall
be explored throughout the weeks

many potential outcomes. It is your
responsibility, not someone else’s.
If we continue to let this cri-
sis go by unnoticed, we may expe-
rience the pain of bonding our gen-
eration through the death of our
friends and family. We are and will
continue to be faced with the trag-
edy of this crisis to “Mourn the
Dead, Bring Home the Living.”

Bucknell students chose wrong forum

It’s easy to understand col- -
lege students’ frustration with
tules that limit their freedom,
because for many that freedom is
new-found. And lots of students
translate those new rights into the
freedom to drink.

Bucknell University in Lewisburg is among the hundreds of col-
leges across the country that have tightened the rules on drinking as
states have moved to raise the drinking age to 21. This puts liquor out
of legal range for most college students.

It also means that while colleges may not be aggressive in keep-
ing liquor out of dormitories, they can no longer allow it to be served at
on-campus parties. This has effectively forced lots of socializing off
campus.

The noise from one Halloween party Wednesday night drew
complaints to the police, and their arrival became the catalyst for a dis-
turbance in which as many as 1,000 students participated. The only
explanation offered by students was that they were upset with the
school’s alcohol policy.

Unfortunately, they chose the wrong way to show their frustra

Turn a problem

By Gary Sojka

Any discussion of what hap-
pened between Bucknell students
and Lewisburg citizens and police
on Halloween must begin with an
apology to the community. It is most unfortunate that Lewisburg citizens
had to endure disruption of their lives because of a growing problem
between university students and the university administration. Please
know that Bucknell is taking steps to encourage our students to reestab-
lish their social lives on campus, rather than in the community.

We also hope that townspeople will have faith in our efforts to
avoid not only the events of the kind we experienced on Halloween but
also other inappropriate student activities, which continue to cause prob-
lems for the citizens of Lewisburg. We at the university are grateful for
the forbearance and understanding of the members of our community as
we take steps to deal with student social life. We also owe a debt to local
law enforcement officials for their restraint in allowing us to resolve the
situation peacefully.

Pennsylvania has a longstanding law prohibiting drinking under
age 21, but in recent years, that law has been redefined in ways that
require strident enforcement. The problem centers on Act 31, enacted by
well-intentioned legislators who were trying to deter what they consid-
ered to be growing problem of alcohol abuse in the under-21 age group.
The unfortunate outcome of this law is that it has turned university
administrators into monitors and disciplinarians rather than guides and
mentors.

In our efforts to comply with the law, we have created a situation
that has encouraged our students to move more and more of their alco-
hol-related social life off campus and into the community, The results
have been negative for this special town where we make our home, and
the situation on campus also is worrisome. We know, for example, that
students are drinking behind closed doors, often to excess, with no one
to say, “Haven’t you had enough?”

Our research tells us that most students begin drinking as early as
high school, if not earlier, and they come to college expecting to escalate

tion. Even though no one was hurt,
the students have a lot to answer

Why should students have the
right to drink, even though state
law prohibits the consumption of

alcohol by people younger than 21?

Why should the school break the law by allowing the uncontrolled
serving of liquor to minors on campus?

Why does it make sense for students to disturb a neighborhood’s
peace by giving vent to their frustration at the school?

Some students will probably try to cloak the incident on Seventh
Street in a noble mantle by calling it a protest against the restriction of
their rights. But they have no right to drink on campus or elsewhere, and
their display took a form that doesn’t even come close to making a point
in their favor with the school or the community.

For all of the real and understandable feclings behind it, Wednes-
day night’s incident wasn’t really a protest—it was a tantrum.

into opportunity

that pattern as part of their “adult”
collége experience. We tell new
freshmen we’ll call them men and
women, not boys and girls. They
are 18, we remind them, and soon
enough they understand that being
men and women means they can vote, hold jobs, pay taxes, and be pros-
ecuted and sentenced as adults. They can, in fact, do everything an adult
can do but drink.

Prohibition should have taught us that people who want alcohol
will go to any lengths to have it. By denying alcohol to students, who
think of themselves as adults even though the law does not hold with
that definition, we may be allowing alcohol to assume even greater
importance in their lives. However, we are sworn to uphold the law, and
we will do so, as will continue to provide social alternatives for students
to celebrate without alcohol.

We also must work with our students, listening to their concerns,
helping them understand that life is not always fair. They can be consid-
ered adults in every sense but one, but that doesn’t absolve them of their
responsibility to their neighbors and the community at large. As educa-
tors, we will continue to work toward a better solution. We welcome
input from townspeople who have had success teaching their own off-
spring that there can be a rich social life without alcohol.

We recognize Bucknell’s responsibility for the Halloween distur-
bance, but we would like to tum it from a problem into an opportunity.
Education is the ultimate solution. We need to continue to educate stu-
dents about the dangers of alcohol abuse, so that if they choose to drink,
they will do so responsibly, fully aware of the harm it can do to their
lives and their careers. And we need to study ourselves as a society to
leam why alcohol—and other substances—enjoy the prominence they
do and what we can do to create more balance and appreciation for other
forms of celebration.

Students look for attitude change

By Mark Leister

With the recent confronta-
tion between police and Bucknell
students in the streets of Lewis-
burg, many people unfamiliar
with the Bucknell situation are
left to glean the facts from secondhand sources. As a Bucknell student,
my opinion attempts to summarize the students’ concems and shed
light on why there is such tension.

The student perceptions of the problem with Bucknell’s social
system stem from incidents which occurred two years ago at the incep-
tion of Act 31, Pennsylvania’s strictest underage drinking law. Just
prior to the semester recess, the university sent out an announcement
explaining the new law and soliciting student opinions.

Unfortunately, the students had no time to voice their concerns
because final exams were underway and free time to address such an
issue was scarce. Upon returning at the beginning of the next semester,
the students found their only exposure to Act 31 to be the university’s
enforcement of the new law. Furthermore, the university appeared to
be basing its rather rigorous enforcement upon an unusually stringent
interpretation of the new law.

In the administration’s attempt to minimize underage drinking-
related liability, it implemented enforcement procedures designed to
make Bucknell as inhospitable for underage alcohol consumption as
possible. For example, the university created the concept of “reasona-
ble cause,” which allowed its security staff to enter private residence
rooms at even the vaguest hint that a party was in progress.

The students felt actions such as these were unusually oppressive
and in violation of student rights. However, they slowly came to terms
with these “invasions of privacy” and began to cope with Bucknell’s
diminished social scene.

Unfortunately, student tolerance was sorely tested when gross
inconsistencies in alcohol enforcement were perceived. Students found
that on important occasions such as Parents Weekend and Homecom-
ing, the university’s enforcement of its alcohol policies was virtually
nonexistent. On these important weekends, when partying ran rampant
and unchecked, the university appeared to be creating an illusion that
Bucknell’s social scene was not at all oppressed.

The students were very aware of this fact and soon realized that
there was an injustice in being trusted only part of the time and at the

A Student’s Voice

university’s discretion. Students
believed that they could handle adult
responsibilities, but that they were
being labeled irresponsible and
untrustworthy by the administration.

This debate over trust between
students and the administration esca-
lated, leading to greater animosity and tensions. These feeling finally sur-
faced on Lewisburg’s Seventh Street on Halloween when students, who
had been told to end an off-campus party, realized they had no place else
to go.

After having been forced from Bucknell’s campus by what was
seen as the oppressive force of the university, the students decided that
they’d had enough. In what can best be labeled an act of emotion, the
students protested their feeling of having no place to socialize or escape
Act 31 and Bucknell’s untrusting and oppressive grip.

Less that a week after Homecoming Weckend, the latest occasion
of inconsistent enforcement, the university’s administration was forced
to tackle student concems head-on.

And it did. The administration finally made an impression on the
students, planting a seed of hope that perhaps would grow into under-
standing between the two groups. Their mere presence into the early
morning hours demonstrated a willingness to listen; Vince DeCerchio,
Bucknell’s new director of security and safety, who is replacing the man
seen by many students as one cause of the oppression, showed that he is
willing to change old ways by working with students to make the univer-

sity more livable. R
Those responsible for the promises to the student body have

already begun to follow words with actions. On Tuesday, key administra-
tors held an open forum to address problems and begin discussions in a
more formal setting, and many students looked upon these steps favora-
bly—but cautiously.

The administration was successful in portraying Bucknell as a
changing setting where everyone can work together—and the students
seem willing to try. The administration will have to follow through with
its promises, however, because there is still a vein of distrust and skepti-
cism within the student body concerning this issue.

Lecture series examines
political economy of media

By Rob Schroeder
Staff Writer

A three-part lecture series
designed to “talk about how it is
that the media is controlled by
major corporations” recently con-
cluded here. Through the sponsor
departments of Economics, Politi-
cal Science, and Sociology, the
function brought significant alter-
native voices to Bucknell; ones
concerned with the influence of
Public broadcasting, the greedy
habits of corporations that control
the media, and terrorism as it is
portrayed and even perpetuated by
the world of information. The
series ran from mid-October to
early November.

The first lecture of the three,
entitled “Public Broadcasting: An
Alternative to Corporate Control?”
was conducted by Steve Bass, the
Director of National Corporate
Support for the Public Broadcasting
System. According to Economics
Professor Dean Baker, the principle
organizer of the series, Bass’s dis-
cussion intended to explain “what it
was like to deal with the major
media corporations.” PBS’s diverse
funding was discussed in detail,
laying on the line the idea that the
network is largely independent of
business manipulation.

Bass, a Bucknell alumni, also
talked about the motivations of cor-
porate giving, and what programs
the business giants will and will not
fund. Even though a major theme
of the talk was PBS’s freedom and
large degree of self-sufficiency,

Bass spoke with respect about the
power of corporations to influence
even those networks that are by and
large public. Corporate sponsors are
not willing to fund programs deal-
ing with controversial issues.
Because of the large degree of
money that comes from business
sponsors, he explained, PBS is not
actually as independent as its mem-
bership might prefer to have it.
Bass was optimistic about this fact,
though, and stressed that the Public

eye, and scrutinize “what it meant
to have corporations...control so
much of what we saw and heard...”
Schiller’s energies were directed
towards exposing the media for
what it is in his view: non-diverse
and almost unilaterally controlled
by business interests. The alleged
free press was a major target of his
impassioned speech. “All of this,
what appears to be diversity,” he
said, “is underwritten with one
common denominator...the financ-

“All of this what appears to be diversity
is underwritten with one common
denominator...the financing of
so-called independent media.”

Former Dean of Communications,
University of California at San Diego

Broadcasting System could still do
hard-hitting things, like view the
probing news show “A Current
Affair.” His main point was that it
was not unthinkable that PBS, with
appropriate outside funding, could
do without corporate support.
“Culture Inc., Corporate
Takeover of Public Expression,”
the second lecture of the series, was
given by Herb Schiller, Former
Dean of Communications at the
University of California at San
Diego. Schiller, Professor Baker
told me, was one of the first persons
to look at the media with a critical

The Collegiate

Perspective...
(and other fairy tales)

By Peter Lalos
Staff Writer

This week, “The Collegiate
Perspective” will conduct a criti-
cal study of the domino-like col-
lapses of the communist nation-
states of eastern Europe, the
Soviet Union, the People’s
Republic of China, and other sec-
ond-world nations across the
globe. Such discourse, it is
hoped, will raise the following
questions: First, how did the dia-
lectical conflict between Marx-
ism in theory and Marxism in
practice serve to tear the social,
political, and economic frame-
works of these socialist regimes
asunder? Secondly, what part did
the intemational community’s
rapid technological advancement
in the fields of communications
and transportation play in the del-
egitimation of the theories of his-
torical determinism and dialecti-
cal materialism followed by these
countries? And finally, why does
every pair of sweaipants that you
buy from the bookstore always
give you an inevitable wedgie?

Furthermore:

* Why are certain foods
listed on the the cafeteria’s menu
boards sometimes placed in quo-
tation marks? It’s a familiar situa-
tion— you look up at the list over
the serving line, and there it is:
“Quiche.” Is this supposed to
mean that it’s not quite that type
of food, but close enough to war-
rant its being served? Time to get
suspicious.

* What Were They Think-
ing When They Did That, Part II:
Did they actually believe that the
colors orange, brown, and green
would look good in just about
every residence hall on campus?
Who was the interior decorator in
charge here? The Toxic
Avenger? Swamp Thing?

* Heck, let’s do that riot

thing on Halloween every year.
We’ ll call it ......mmm
Gras

* Why were our instructors
called “teachers” while we were
still in grade school, but are
called “professors” now? Wh—
What’s that all about?

* A couple years back
when I was in high school, I
remember that I had consistently
never heard of any of the musical
groups listed in Rolling Stone’s
top ten college albums; I just fig-
ured that your tastes took a weird
tum once you entered the colle-
giate level of study. Now that
I've been in college for a
while.... I still haven’t heard of
any of them. Somehow, campus
security is responsible for this.

* That New York Times in
the caf coatroom? Still there.

* Forget the new Bison.
Forget the Greek system. Forget
the administration. We need to
import more squirrels, and fast!

* The definition of a Buck-
nell student’s nirvana? A wash-
ing machine that takes pennies.

* Apparently they’re sell-
ing “I Joined the Stampede to the
Bison Grand Opening” t-shirts.
I’ve got a better idea. How about
if we sell “I Made it Through
Most of the Semester Alive
Without the Real Bison” t-
shirts... Now that’s something to
really boast about.

* I’ve fallen, and I can’t...
Wait a minute! I can get up! I
can walk! I can walk!!!!

ing of so-called
media.”

Schiller adeptly gave exam-
ples of his ideas, exposing the audi-
ence to facts and figures like this
one: about 70% of newspapers are
financed by sponsors. The “crucial
message,” he said, “is the advertis-
ing message.” We consumers are
exhorted to selectively spend our
money via the media’s promotion
of goods. “Life,” in Schiller’s view,
is “one big consumption festival.”
Due to the tremendous influence of
big business in the media (which
includes the entertainment indus-
try), the public is only permitted to
view a select, pre-determined array
of information and entertainment,
all the while being asked to buy the
products of those that make the
decisions of what is shown.
According to Schiller, this is hardly
in keeping with the freedom of
speech that the United States so
proudly proclaims. Those who can

independent

express themselves, he summar-
ized, are those with the money.

The final lecture of the series
was entitled “The Media and the
Terrorism Industry,” which
explored the portrayal of terrorism
in the mass media, and how a sup-
posedly free and independent press
seems to follow a government line.
The lecture was given by Edward
Herman, a Professor of Finance at
the Wharton School of Business.

Who is a terrorist and who is
not, he stressed, is not an objective
issue. “No one who is our [the
United States’) friend is a terrorist,”
he stated. He cited Syria as an
example of the press’s and the gov-
ernment’s subjective labeling of
terrorism. After an incident in
which Syria helped to free U.S.
hostages, the United States was
willing to overlook Syria’s former
violations of human rights and
international law. It is the “ultimate
double standard” of the United
States that we allow such favors to
exist, Herman said.

The administration and the
press are willing to ignore those
issues that are beneficial to the
image of the United States, but
quickly label similar issues not ben-
eficial as terrorist. “No matter what
{a country] [does] in the way of
killing, murdering, or terrorizing”
is almost insignificant as long as
that country is friendly to the
United States. Subjective labeling
of what terrorist activity is does not
coincide with the allegedly impar-
tial press of this country, stressed
Herman.

Herman’s talk, like Schiller’s
and Bass’s, painted an alarming
Picture about the state of the media
today. The Political Economy of
the Media lecture series, though
disturbing and shocking at times,
nonetheless provided a_ starting
point for serious thought about
what the public sees and hears day
in and day out.

Dear Wanda

Dear Wanda,

I have a friend from high
school with whom I just don’t
feel comfortable anymore. Every
time I’m home, she calls and asks
why I don’t write or call her any-
more. I know the same thing will
happen over Thanksgiving break,
what can I do?

Cornered

Dear Cornered,

This is a common problem.
You seem to have changed while
your friend expects you to be the
way you were in high school. If she
was not a good friend, you can tell
her you have been very busy with
school work. This is probably true
anyway. If you were close to her in
high school, she deserves more
respect than a quick brush-off. The
best solution in this case is to be
honest. Perhaps you can say that
you feel you’ve changed and you
don’t feel as close to her anymore.
You should let her know that you
don’t want to sever the ties com-
pletely, though. Emphasize the fact
that you don’t feel comfortable
being as close as you used to be. Be
careful of her feelings; try to ima-
gine how you would fecl in her
place.

Dear Wanda,

I had a lousy room pick last
year and I’ve been living in a
double on a hall I don’t like. My

Before Natalie Merchant
and the 10,000 Maniacs opened
their act at Susquehanna Univer-
sity last Friday night, Mary Ram-
sey and her band prepared the
audience with folk songs accom-
panied by violin. Ramsey’s voice
has a sound much like Mer-
chant’s, and so it was not surpris-
ing to learn that Merchant and
Ramsey have been recording
together on a number of the
10,000 Maniacs well-known hits.

After “Ramsey and Lom-
bardo”, the opening act, finished
their set, and after a brief inter-
mission, the 10,000 Maniacs
began their act not with a song
but a film. Their documentary-
style reel of images portrayed
Jamestown, New York (Mer-
chant’s home town) around 1950,
and was accompanied by a jazz
selection unlike anything the
10,000 Maniacs would be likely
to play. After the wordless film,
the group began their show with
a song off of their latest album.

Merchant and her band
played many of the public’s
favorites from their best known
album, Jn My Tribe. Unfortu-
nately, the performance of sev-
eral of these songs was delivered
with an inordinate amount of
feed-back. Perhaps the size of the
auditorium contributed to the
feed-back. The auditorium was
smaller than Davis Gym which is
where the 10,000 Maniacs played
three years ago. At that concert,
for those who remember, Tracy
Chapman, a_ then virtually
unknown performer, opened for
the Maniacs and received an
indifferent, verging on rude,
reception.

The themes of the eve-
ning were Thanksgiving and
peace. Merchant requested that
the audience sing a Thanksgiving
song for her, which didn’t work

too well; nevertheless she later
requested that we sing “Peace
Train” for the band. The peace
theme became explicit when
Merchant held a dyed flag embla-
zoned with the peace symbol in
front of her, covering herself
from the audience’s view, as she
sang the last song. The crowd
seemed overly receptive to the
various appeals for peace
throughout the evening.

"Gun Shy,” the In My Tribe
song about a woman’s resistance
to her brother’s joining the army
was also well received by the
audience. The message is timely,
in that the U.S. is on the brink of
war in the Middle East and
Americans have been slow in ral-
lying for peace. Nevertheless, the
tie-dyed apparel and the fingers
making peace symbols waved in
the air at Susquchanna seemed to
reflect a sort of hollow symbol-
ism and rhetoric.

The band did, of course,
return for an encore, finishing up
with “City of Angels”, “Happy
Puppet”, and finally “Verdi
Cries.” Many voices in my sec-
tion could be heard shouting out
requests for “Verdi Cries”, which
turned out to be the final selec-
tion of the evening. The rendition
of the song was performed by
Merchant at the piano and Ram-
sey on the violin, which pulled
together the range of music and
styles heard from both
performers.

An unfortunate aspect of
the evening was the lack of pub-
licity for the opening band. The
opening act was listed no where
in print: neither on the ticket
stubs nor on the announcement
board in Weber Chapel Auditor-
ium, where the concert was held.
Apparently Ramsey’s band was a
surprise to the Susquehanna box
office manager as well, for the
office was unable to provide a
name of the band even after the
show.

The Bucknellian ;

By Lydia Neuman

Tonight renowned — singer
Judy Collins will appear at the
Weis Center as part of the Weis
Center’s Special Effects Series.
Since the outset of her career in the
early sixties, Collins has recorded
such hits as “Send in the Clowns”
and “Both Sides Now” as part of a
broad repertoire that encompasses
songs from musicals and has cul-
minated in six gold records.

Collins has been labeled as
America’s storyteller and in addi-
tion to performing with the Boston
Pops, the National Symphony and
the Chicago, Atlanta, San Fran-
cisco and Detroit symphony
orchestras, she has toured exten-
sively throughout Europe. In 1968,
Collins was the guest artist at the
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,
Royal Festival Hall in London.

Collin’s credits extend to the
realm of theater as well. She
Starred in the New York Shake-
speare production of “Peer Gynt”
and has appeared frequently on
such shows as “The Tonight
Show,” “Saturday Night Live,”
“David Letterman,” “Sesame
Street” and “The Today Show.”
Crusades for World Peace, AIDS
Research and World Hunger
among others, are movements to

which Collins has committed her
time and energies.

Collins's new album, Fires of
Eden has just been released on
Columbia records. This is her first
album with Columbia and her
enthusiasm for this new release is
tremendous. She is not only excited
about the songs, but also about the
causes which the album is working
for. The songs speak about peace
and the plight of the homeless and
the value of the earth's precious
resources,

The letter on the inside of the
CD cover points out the messages
of some of the songs and talks
about the importance of being con-
scious about our environment. Trees
must be planted to replace those
which have been lost and paper
must be recycled. Collins asks her
listeners to take their first steps in
recycling by throwing away the
box that the CD comes in. Also,
Collins talks about a fund which she
has begun which will take proceeds
from each sold copy of Fires of
Eden and work to plant saplings in
Colorado to make the air that we
breathe just a little bit "sweeter."

Tonight's performance should
feature songs from Collins's past
albums and songs from Fires of
Eden, such as "The Blizzard" and
"The Air That I Breathe."

The Center Gallery has
opened its second exhibit of the
year this week. Unlike the last
exhibit, this display features not
five artists, but fifty, and not paint-
ings, but photographs. The exhibit
is titled Exits and Entrances and
provides the viewer with 115 pho
tographs, some black and white,
some color, and some handpainted
works, of various exits and
entrances.

The title of the exhibit lim-
ited the artists to showing only
images of exits and entrances, but
the title also left quite a bit of room
for personal interpretation. And
interpret they did. Artists took the
concepts of exit and enter to the
extremes. Some artists
simple images of doors and win
dows while other artists provided
photographs in which they took a
less literal interpretation of exit
and enter.

Gallery director, Robert
Metzger, commented that “the pho-
tographs, in a variety of sizes and
approaches, range from public
spaces in large cities to everyday
genre scenes in the United States
and abroad. There are also views
of intimate surroundings and dra-
matic portrayals of urban life.
Together, the photographs in this
exhibition present a unique visual
perspective to humanity's relation-

Paul Simon is known to
many as part of the
generational folk group, Simon and
Garfunkel. To others, he is the man
who brought the sounds of South
Africa to the American pop scene
with his 1987 release of Graceland
But his most recent release, Rhythm
of the Saints, is to the rhythms and
sounds of Brazil as Graceland was
to the harmonizing sounds of South
Africa. It is rare that we see such an
individual stay on the music scene
for nearly thirty years, and be able
to continue to produce albums of
such high quality and diversity

The cultural exploration
opens with a rhythmic intro into
“The Obvious Child,” which is a
retrospective look at a life which
has become complacent and ordi
nary. Sunny, Simon’s character,

The butler provides humor

What the Butler Saw will be performed November 16-19 in the Tustin Studio Theatre. The play will be
directed by Karen McCann as part of her senior thesis. Pictured here are Professor Baumwoll, Meme Cul-
lison '91, and Penelope Kokines '91.

By Deborah Bloodgood

The Department of Theatre
and Dance will be performing What
the Butler Saw by Joe Orton, from
November 16-19 at 8 p.m. in Tustin
Studio Theatre. The cast consists of
Professor Dennis Baumwoll as Dr.
Prentice, Penelope Kokines ‘91, as
his nymphomaniac wife, Marc
Kenny ‘91, as the government
inspector, Meme Cullison ‘91, as
the ingenue, George Hannah ‘93 as
the lustful bellboy, and Tom Quinn
‘91, as the bumbling Sergeant
Match.

The play is directed by senior
Karen McCann as part of her senior
thesis. McCann describes the play
as “multifaceted. It explores the

dramaturgy of farcical convention,
while examining the oppressive
nature of social institutions.”

Orton combines dark humor
and slapstick in the traditional
drawing room set to create a
thought provoking picture of the
effects of society on its members.
He uses the conventional motiva-
tions of farce—lust, greed, and ego-
centrism as well as other conven-
tions—transvestism, preset props,
and the “seduction-gone-wrong”
motif which leads to a snowballing
of misunderstandings.

McCann Suggests _ that
“Always beneath the Wildean com-
edy of manners lies the Dionysian/
Apollonian conflict to fulfill vis-
ceral human needs, which dictates

the action.” The result is pure
lunacy.

Orton wrote in England dur-
ing the 1960's. Within several
years of writing his first play, he
had gained fame throughout Eng-
land with two full length plays, one
screen play and several one acts. In
1967 in the midst of his budding
fame, he was brutally in his sleep at
the age of 29 by a jealous lover.

What the Butler Saw was
found completed in his room dur-
ing the murder investigation. It was
produced posthumously in 1969.
McCann relates that “Orton’s life-
style was one of flamboyant homo-
sexuality, a subject dealt with in his
plays over and over again.

Anais Nin’s diaries
expose Miller’s life story

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

In his cinematic rendering
of Anais Nin’s diaries from the
year of 1931, director Philip
Kaufman has compellingly pre-
sented the passionate dynamic

| between art and life—a dynamic

so forceful that the characters
attempt to consume one another
sexually and by means of the writ-
ten word. “Henry and June,”
which showed at the Campus
Theater this week, reverberated

| with the erotic and intellectual

intensity of Paris’s bohemian

| quarter which was the home of

Anais’s expatriate lovers Henry

| and June Miller,

The very apprearence of a
film such as “Henry and June,”
which was highly erotic and dealt
explicitly with lesbian relation-

| ships, was an event in itself and a

welcome departure from the more
common fare found at the Cam-

| pus Theater,

Kaufman, who has also
directed an adaptation Milan Kun-
dera’s “The Unbearable Lightness
of Being,” based his work on
Anais Nin’s diaries from those
early years when she met the as

} yet unknown author Henry Miller
| living in Parisian squalor and

writing his infamous book The
Tropic of Cancer. Anais, a dedi-
ated diarist and novelist through
out her life, chronicled her years
of initial intellectual engagement
with Miller through their sexual
Passion and into their years of
friendship and literary

| partiership.

The segment of Anais’s

| diaries that she herself entitled

“Henry and June” tell of her rela-
tions with Miller, but also of
Anais’s emotional attachment and
sexual desire for Miller’s pale
wife with burning eyes, June. In
Kaufman’s rendering, June is pre-
sented as the sexual and literary
object of both Miller and Anais.
June, played by Uma
Thomas, considers her portrayal
in The Tropic of Cancer too base;
when she recognizes herself in
Anais’s first draft of what would
become House of Incest, she com-
plains that she is not real enough.
As June would say, she wanted
“beauty” and she wanted Miller to
be a “Dosteovesky” as he cap-
tured her beauty. Nor did she find
in Anais’s perception a correct or

authentic vision of herself. Rather,
all she found were writers, writers
who use and consume their
subjects.

Indeed, writing as sexual
possession and sexual possession
as writing is the metaphor which
unites the action of “Henry and
June.” Both Anais and Miller,
played by Maria de Mederios and
Fred Ward, record their erotic
experiences in writing and in some
sense may be said to be secking
this erotica for the sake of their
writing. As intellectuals—and par-
ticularly in Anais’s c a_bour-
geois intellectual—Anais and
Miller are consumers of the rough
beauty of the Brooklyn actress that
exists without words.

This set of relations is com-
pleted by Junc’s desire to have her
living given literary expression.
June becomes the continuing object
of these writers intellectual and
sexual energies, but the relation-
ships are a bit one-sided. June, as
she says, “keeps giving and giving”
in order to fill Anais’s and Miller’s
white pages

Yet, both textually and
through his cinematography, Kauf-
man critiques both the dynamic
between heterosexuality and homo-
sexuality, as well as the very nature
of bourgeois society. Anais and
Miller may desire June as a sexual
and literary object which they can
use and recreate, but Anais relates
to June far differently than Miller,

There is an emotion which
transcends Miller’s childish desire

makes the sexuality shared
between Anais and June far more
erotic than Miller’s “brutality.” It is
particularly in these scenes when
Anais and June are together that
Kaufman’s use of the camera is the
most perceptive, most able to delve
beneath appearences to their emo-
tional undercurrent.

Anais “understands June as a
woman” which is something Miller
can not even begin to comprehend.
For Anais, June remains objectified
but in a more peculiar and loving
way; their meetings are charged
with the sense that a great deal is at
stake—love

Alt various moments in the
film as Anais and June are standing
with men, talking with men, their
eyes continue find each other. Here
Kaufman brilliantly has the men
physically surrounding the women
while the vision of these women,

their thoughts and desires, cannot
be so restrained. Indeed, Kauf-
man effectively conveys the cru-
cial nature of vision in this
dynamic of perception _ that
grasps word and flesh.

But while Anais may be
more compassionate to June, her
stakes in this erotic and literary
game are not as steep as Miller’s.
When June stands against him in
his filthy apartment, Miller bursts
into a juvenile outrage since out-
side of his writing and his subject
in June he is completely impov-
erished. Anais, though an intel-
lectual like Miller, has not made
an attempt to reject her bourgeois
home and husband. When chaos
racks her life on the dirty streets
of the West Bank, her thoroughly
bourgeois husband Hugo comes
along in his shiny auto to take
her away—her early manuscript
of House of Incest under her arm.

In “Henry and June” Kauf-
man recreates the intellectual fer-
ment and the moral chaos of
Paris in the 1930s. By beginning
the film with the opening strains
of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring
and using clips of Dada cinema-
tography such as Dali’s Un
Chien Andoulou, the climate of
tension and gnawing _ social
uncertainty is established.
Indced, Miller wages his battle
againsi moral prohibition which
so attracted Anais in the com-
pany of magicians, clowns, and
contortionists; the neighborhood
in which his apartment is located
is carnivalesque.

Hugo, the voice of the
bourgeoisie, says that he has
always feared carnivals. This
fearful and disturbing climate
where all is allowed—nudity,
sex, rape—and all moral codes
are null, excites the bourgeoisie,
but ultimately repulses causing
them to retum to their fine
homes. The parasitic artist,
though, follows their money and
panders to their interests, using
them just as he used the beauty
of June. But ultimately Miller
was not able to write Anais out
of his life as he had June since
his need for her capital was
unquenchable; while in The
Tropic of Cancer he was able to
completely consume June, leav-
ing it to Anais to write her story
as only a woman could.

The never-ending debate...
Should college football have a playoff?

The bowl system should stay |{A national playoff is needed

By Mark Griffith
Staff Writer

As the holiday season
approaches, so do the plethora of
college bowl games and the
never-dying issue of whether or
not the NCAA should initiate a
playoff system to decide college
football’s national champion.

As some might say, if col-
lege basketball has its NCAA
Tournament, and college baseball
has the College World Scries,
why can’t college football have a
playoff system to decide its
national champion?

A careful analysis of the
facts and nature of the present sit-
uation reveals why the NCAA
has not and should not sway from
the current system that has given
college football the New Year’s
spotlight it deserves.

The first argument that is
given in favor of a playoff is
always that a non-subjective
manner should be used to deter-
mine the national champion.

I ask these proponents of a
playoff system to tell me if they
plan to do away with the ranking
system. Surely the Associated
Press’s determination of the top
twenty-five teams in the nation

would have to stay in order for the
mythical number one vs. number
two match-up to occur.

Now, I ask again, how objec-
tive is the ranking system? For
instance, how qualified was the
University of Virginia when the
honor of number one was bestowed
upon it? The question of subjectiv-
ity would not be eliminated with a
playoff.

The playoff proponents want
a situation where the supposed top
two teams play each other for the
national title.

For all you Penn State fans,
you certainly remember when the
second-ranked Nittany —_Lions
defeated Vinny Testaverde and the
top-ranked Hurricanes.

Oh, by the way, this year’s
Orange Bowl is pitting Notre Dame
against the Buffaloes of Colorado,
the present number one and number
two teams once again. What a
coincidence.

A playoff should include the
top sixteen teams, advocates say.
This would make sure the best team
won. That would take every week
of December so that the finals
would still fall on New Year’s Day.
Do these football players also
attend a college for academic rea-
sons or can they take sick leave for

The

the traditional finals period?

If the NCAA practices
what they preach regarding aca-
demics, this period in December
will be left for the classroom, not
the gridiron.

Begin the playoffs after the
finals period, they might add.
What? No determination of a
national champion on New
Years’ Day? Where is their sense
of tradition? We might as well
hold the Super Bowl on a Tues-
day and cat chicken for Thanks-
giving if we are going to that
extreme.

Enough of why _ there
should not be a playoff system.
Now I will give a positive effect
that the present bowl picture
gives to the sport.

When the last second of the
last college bowl game has ticked
off the clock, the season still lives
in the minds of the fans,

The fans have something to
debate for the months to come. If
college football comes to the cut
and dried determination of a
national champion as is seen by
some in the playoff system, the
game will lose the aspect of con-
troversy that makes the New
Year’s festivities a full day of
excitement.

“Sideline coach” provides
faculty unique opportunity

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

At a glance of Bucknell, one
tends to notice the strong academic
atmosphere prevalent throughout
the campus. No one doubts that the
Students and teachers treat educa-
tion with a great amount of serious-
ness and intensity. But a majority
of the people that grace the halls of
Coleman and Vaughan Lit. also
give their best efforts on the ath-
letic fields as well. At Bucknell a
“student-athlete” is not the oxy-
moron that it is at other campuses.
In fact, our university has accumu-
lated the second-most Academic

defensive strategies for Saturday.
At this time the faculty members
are split up so that one will work
with the offensive coordinator
while the other works with the de-
fensive coordinator.

On Wednesday, the partici-
pants will attend the 4:45 p.m.
Practice to experience the rigors of
the game, and observe the work
which each member of the team
puts into the sport. Before the prac-
tice, the coaches will review what
was discussed Tuesday, and apply
those lessons to the practice. As
Jamieson stated, the emphasis of
the learning experience is on the
faculty member’s realization of the

some extent, still are, reluctant to
accept excuses for missed classes if
they involve athletics. With the
“Sideline Coach” program, the gap
has been bridged, and new lines of
communication have been opened
up for the benefit of faculty mem-
bers and students.

Marketing professor Dan Gil-
bert told the Philadelphia Daily
News, “I know that the academic
side has discovered how truly dedi-
cated the coaches are and how se-
riously they view academics. From
the point of view of the athletic
department—which has always
stood off to itself—it helps the
coaches build relationships [among

All-Americans in the faculty] and
TE
id

the nation, an
students here take
pride in __ this
strong tradition.

In an
attempt to tran-
scend this com-
mitment to excel-
lence from the students to faculty
members, the athletic department,
led by Bucknell Director of Athlet-
ics Rick Hartzell, has instituted the
“Sideline Coach” program. Cur-
rently, Bucknell is the only school
in the country to employ such a
program.

The concept for “Sidcline
Coach” is rather simple. Sid Jamie-
son, coordinator of the program,
began last year by searching the
school for participants. His goal
was to select faculty and adminis-
trators “from each discipline of the
school.” The focus of the program
was to demonstrate to the faculty
that athletics and academics should
not be at odds with each other.
Jamieson said, “The program
allows the faculty to get gut feel-
ings about the good relationship
that exists between academics and
athletics.”

Upon being selected by
Jamieson, two faculty members
receive memos in the mail with the
agenda for the week. Their job is to
observe, but they are free to partici-
pate in any way they feel comforta-
ble. Along with the agenda, they
will each receive a playbook with
which to follow along. On Tues-
day, the participants attend the 8
p.m, film drill in Davis Gym,
where the football staff will review
films and plan their offensive and

“What people are discovering is that
coaches are indeed teachers and that
athletes are indeed students.”

preparation that is involved in each
practice. As the participants lear,
this organization is very similar to
what a teacher must do each week
in preparation for their classes.

Finally, on Saturday the
faculty members take the field with
the Bison and stand on the side-
lines for the duration of the game.
At halftime, they sit in on the team
meeting and experience the inten-
sity of the game that one does not
sense from the stands. In_ his
memo, Jamieson warns the partici-
pants that they will be part of an
extremely emotional experience,
and that they may hear things that
“only occur in football locker
rooms,” but that they should be
understanding. On the Tuesday
after the game, the faculty mem-
bers are invited to the Lewisburg
Touchdown Club luncheon where
they have the opportunity to speak
of their experience.

The results of the program
have been nothing short of extraor-
dinary since its inception last year.
Before the program began, the rela-
tionship between faculty members
and athletic coaches was somewhat
strained. The apparent lack of
communication and physical dis-
tance between academic and ath-
letic buildings had a great deal to
do with this problem. Oftentimes,
faculty members were, and, to

opens lines of
communication
that can be bene-
ficial in terms of
acceptance.”
; Hartzell
Rick Hartzell agreed, stating,
“What people are
discovering is that coaches are
indeed teachers and that athletes
are indeed students. When I started
here two years ago, I remember
people kept referring to the athletic
department as ‘they’ or ‘those peo-
ple across campus.’ Our aim here is
to change those words to ‘us.’””
Another positive aspect of the
program is that it proves Bucknell
is steering clear of rules violations.
In the age of recruiting scams and
steroid abuse in college football,
Bucknell has managed to come out
untainted. Certain stereotypes pre-
vail throughout college football,
and faculty and trustees are
undoubtedly led astray by such
accusations. Bucknell has “no
secrets” according to Head Coach
Lou Maranzana. The “Sideline
Coach” program allows Bucknell to
legitimately dispel any possible
myths regarding rule infractions.
The success of the “Sideline
Coach” program at Bucknell has
shown signs of a new trend in col-
lege football. Similar to the Soviet
Union’s policy of “Glasnost,” the
Bison football team is setting an
example by revealing itself to the
community. The results have been
unquestionably positive. Of the
twenty-plus faculty members that
have participated in the program,
all have viewed it as a tremendous
experience.

Bucknellian

By Mark Abrahamsen
Staff Writer

Around this time every
November, college football enthu-
siasts across the nation wonder
what the game would be like if it
had a national playoff to look for-
ward to. It’s rather amazing in
these days of television and
money ruling big-time college ath-
letics, that the NCAA hasn’t insti-
tuted a post-season plan that
would be tailor-made for universi-
ties, TV, and college football fans.

Every team sport that the
NCAA recognizes on a Division I
level already has established a
post-season tournament to deter-
mine an outright national cham-
pion. Currently NCAA  basket-
ball’s “March Madness” is the
most exciting sports spectacle in
the United States. A playoff for
Division I football would rival the
current NCAA basketball tourna-
ment for the top single event in
intercollegiate athletics, and every
year there would be no debate as
to who really is #1.

Many traditionalists favor
keeping the bowl structure as it is
They argue that a playoff season
would run too long (conflicting
with academic finals), the system
would corrupt the game further
with greedy and unethical coaches
and athletic directors, and each of

the individual bowls would lose
their historical flavor. These argu-
ments are credible, but they fail to
illustrate the bottom line of what
the game is ultimately all about:
determining which of two teams is
better.

For many universities which
field perennial bow! teams, their
football programs are simply step-

ping stones for athletes to reach

the National Football League. As
for the thought of “student-
athletes” having troubles mixing
classes with the extended season,
those who are truly concerned
about academics should attend uni-
versities such as Bucknell or any
other school that is primarily aca-
demically-oriented. And if an ath-
lete doesn’t believe he can be
noticed by professional scouts at a
Division I-AA or smaller school,
direct that person to Bison tackle
and mechanical engineer Jay Butler
*91, who is likely to be drafted
somewhere in the middle rounds of
the upcoming N.F.L. Draft. The
greatest running back of all time,
Walter Payton, never played in a
major college bowl game. He spent
his collegiate career at Division II
Jackson State.

The college game is already
too corrupt with drugs, money, and
illegal recruiting, so much so that
adding a playoff isn’t going to
make the present “win at all costs”
attitudes worse. As for the bowls’
sense of nostalgia, my playoff plan
would include keeping their titles
and sites, and the potential match-
ups would be significantly more
attractive for the fans
The following playoff sce-
nario would cure all heated debates
in offices, bars, and locker rooms
as to who is the best team in the
land:
) Keep the Associated Press
(sportswriters) poll during the regu-
lar season, but eliminate from the
rankings all teams that are on pro-
bation for the current year. Elimi-
nate all other polls for simplicity.

2) Award the top 16 teams
from the final A.P. poll a bid for
post-season play.

3) Form a single-elimination
tournament upon the conclusion of

November 16, 1990

the regular season, where #1
would face #16 in the first round,
#2 vs. #15, #3 vs. #14, and so on.
On the surface many of these
first-round contests would appear
to be mis-matches, but if the sea-
son ended today, top-ranked
Notre Dame would play #16
Michigan. (Not a bad game for an
opening-round contest.)

4) Eliminate the four small-
est current bowls (California,
Independence, Freedom, and
Copper). The remaining fifteen
bowls would generate the 15
games required for the proposed
playoff, and each game would be
played with the bowl’s current
name and held at its present site.

5) Start the tournament the
first Saturday after Thanksgiving.
The tournament would take four
weeks to play, and the champion-
ship would conclude before
Christmas. This would allow both
players and coaches a_ well-
deserved rest for the holidays.

6) Rotate the National
Championship each __ season
between the traditional “major
bowls” (Rose, Cotton, Orange,
and Sugar), so that Pasadena, Dal-
las, Miami, and New Orleans
would host the title once every
four years.

In the recent months, many
universities (e.g. Penn State,
Miami, Arkansas) have affiliated
themselves as new members of
established conferences. With the
recent shuffling of schools, it
appears that a playoff in college
football is certain for the future
perhaps within five years. When
the inevitable occurs, a tourna-
ment leading to the National
Championship will be healthy for
the game of collegiate football,

and for its fans as well.

Volleyball ends season
winless in Patriot League

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The women’s volleyball team
concluded a disappointing season
last weekend as it bowed out of the
Patriot League tournament after los-
ing both of its matches. Bucknell
fell to the eventual champion, Col-
gate, in the first match 15-10, 15-6,
15-7, and to the host team, Holy
Cross, 15-1, 15-11, 15-11. Bucknell
finished the season with an overall
record of 3-22, 0-6 in the confer-
ence. Lady Bison coach Cindy
Opalski was out of town and una-
vailable for comment.

After coming off a good prac-
lice session, Bucknell was fired up
to play the Lady Red Raiders of
Colgate in their first-round match.
However, Colgate was ready for the
challenge, as the took the Lady
Bison in three straight games.
Bucknell’s middle blockers, Kris
Colbert ‘91 and Kathleen Sullivan
“92, the latter who led the Patriot
League in blocking, proved their
dominance at the net as they each
chalked up five blocks in the match.
Outside hitter Meg Kinney ’92 led
all Lady Bison with seven kills.

“We really played well
against Colgate,” said co-captain
Kara Forosisky °92. “I think we
took them by surprise, because eve-
ryone was really up for the match.”

Bucknell didn’t fare as well
against the Lady Crusaders in their
second match, as they took a beat-
ing in the first game 15-1. But
Bucknell rebounded in the second
and third games, scoring 11 points
in each, Colbert, in her last match
as a Lady Bison, chalked up five
more blocks for the tournament and
put down nine kills. Sullivan came
up with four blocks and assisted on
three others.

Michael Klemen/The Bucknellian

Sarah Mesaros ’93 and Meg Kinney ’92 ready themselves to return an
Opponent’s serve in a match played earlier this season. The Lady
Bison struggled this year, finishing 0-6 in the league and 3-22 overall.

“We really didn’t play all that
well (against Holy Cross), but Kris
had a great tournament up front,”
said Forosisky. “She is going to be
greatly missed, especially up front
as a middle blocker. It takes a lot of
time and experience to play middle
blocker and we’re going to have a
tough time replacing her.”

Colgate wound up winning
the tournament, beating previously
unbeaten Army in the tournament

finals. Lehigh almost pulled off a
big upset when it forced top-seeded
Army to five games in the semifi-
nal game, and the Lady Engincers
wound up taking fourth-place. As
for Bucknell, it will look to next
year when the team will have four
seniors with considerable
experience.

to kick an 18-yard field goal after
being unsuccessful in three rushing
attempts from the one-yard line.
The key play of the drive was a 12
yard-completion from Hatajik to
Lester Erb ’91. Erb has caught 40.
passes this year for 648 yards. The
field goal, which made the score 7-
3, was Krutchkoff’s seventh in a
row, tying a Bucknell record that
was set in 1982. Krutchkoff has not
missed a field goal all season
Lehigh was not phased
though, as it took the ensuing kick-
off and drove 59 yards in just six
plays to increase its lead to 14-3 on
a nine-yard run by Erick Torain
The key play in the drive was a 38-

yard pass play, which set up the
touchdown run.

The Engineers had one more
threat late in the half, as they drove
50 yards before Trevor Smith ‘91
came up with an interception with
25 seconds left in the half. Smith
leads the team with five
interceptions.

In the first half, the Engineers
outpassed the Bison 132 yards to
23. Hatajik only completed 3 of 11
passes. Both teams were ineffective
on the ground, Lehigh gaining 38
yards while Bucknell only gained
30. The stingy Bucknell defense
kept the Bison in the game.

Maranzana did not make any
changes at halftime, telling his
players to “hang in there, that we

had a chance and we could score.
The best thing we did was not to
change. We hung with the original
plan and the people we had.”

Bucknell finally got the
offense into gear, as it took the ball
on its second possession of the half
and moved 66 yards, using over
five minutes of the clock. The key
play was on a 33-yard completion
from Hatajik to Erb. The drive con-
cluded with a three-yard run by
Matt Walsh ‘93. Bucknell then
tried for the two-point conversion
attempting to bring the score within
a field goal, but the pass fell incom-
plete, keeping the score at 14-9.

For the second straight time
Lehigh responded to a Bucknell
score with a touchdown of its own.

The Engineers went 54 yards in 10
plays, finishing with an cight-yard
run by Chris Menet. The drive
included a 21-yard pass on fourth-
and-five on the Bucknell 29.
Lehigh also attempted the two-
point conversion, but also came up
empty, leaving the score at 20-9.

Lehigh got the ball back three
plays later after intercepting a Hata-
jik pass on the Bucknell 27. After
eight plays, the Engineers scored
on a one-yard plunge by Torain,
increasing their lead to 27-9.
Again, Lehigh was sparked by a
fourth-down conversion, this one
an 8-yard completion.

This week the Bison host
Fordham in the last game of the
season. Fordham enters the contest
with a 1-8 record, including five
straight losses. Last week the Rams
suffered a 48-0 drubbing to Holy
Cross, in which Fordham only
amassed 126 yards total offense.
Last season the Bison easily
defeated Fordham 31-7.

because we are going to have some
extensive off-season training. Last
year it was tough because we had
no coach, but this year we can
hopefully make ourselves a lot bet-
ter in the off-season.”

Kelly Marsh ’91 receives Athlete of the Weck honors after lead
ing the Lady Bison cross-country team to a third-place finish at the
ECAC Championships last weekend. Marsh finished ninth overall in a
driving rainstorm, completing the 5K course in 19:35. She has been the
top runner for Bucknell in three of her four meets this season. As
Marsh’s cross-country career comes to a close, her personal best time
in a meet was 18:47, set in 1989

Marsh has always been a leader both on and off the course for
Bucknell, as she has maintained a 4.0 ‘Cumulative GPA at the univer
sity. The senior captain was named first-team GTE Academic All
American last year, a feat that she looks to duplicate during this aca
demic year. She is applying for a

that is ironic is that with the condi-
tions the team that gets ahead usu-

The fourth quarter began
with the Bison trailing by 18
points. They scored touchdowns on
all three of their fourth quarter pos-
sessions, controlling the ball for
over 12 of the 15 minutes. The first
touchdown came following the
kickoff after Lehigh’s final score.
Bucknell’s offense, which began
on its own 42-yard line, drove the
length of the field, ending with a
one i run by Brian Henesey
92. The key plays of the drive
were a 25-yard pass from Hatajik
to Jeff Pape ‘92, and a three-yard
gain by Henesey on a fourth-and-

Running in the ECAC Cham-

the Lady Bison finished third

y I points. Just ahead of

Bucknell was Army, which totaled

111 points, and first-place finisher

Manhattan, which amassed 100
points.

As they ran through both
mud and pouring rain, the women
not only managed to finish ahead of
six other teams, but also kept the
race close among Army, Manhattan
and themselves. Even more impres-
sive was the fact that Bucknell
defeated Lehigh and Lafayette, two
teams that had beaten the Lady
Bison just two weeks earlier at the
Patriot League Championships.

Captain Kelly Marsh °91
remarked, “It was really exciting to
be able to bounce back after confer-
ences and beat Lafayette and
Lehigh. It was a nice ending to our
season.”

Cross-country coach Art Gul-
den was in agreement with the idea
that the team’s resilience proved to
be a positive influence of the
outcome.

Gulden noted, “It was eal

good being able to bounce back—
that’s what we’re trying to teach.
It’s the most important lesson of
athletics. I know that sounds trite,
but that’s what we did.”

As far as the entire season
was concerned, Marsh stated, “We
had an up-and-down year, but I
think it shows promise for the
future and for indoor track.”

Again, Gulden saw the situa-
tion in a similar light. “It was a
good year, not great, but we only
had that one bad race,” he said.
“Unfortunately, it was conferences,
{the Patriot League Champion-
ships] but that happens.”

The men’s team, however,
did not enjoy similar success. Fin-
ishing last out of the IC4A field,
the Bucknell men failed to qualify
for nationals.

Gulden said, “We were disap-
pointed. Obviously, we expected
more. We picked a bad time to
have a bad race. Sometimes you
Tun a flat one, and this was our flat
one.”

The men experienced a few
extra difficulties, as runners Jeff
Loomis ’92 and Bob Kelly ’92 both
fell at the start of the race, losing at
least ten yards form the leaders,
and causing them to get stuck in the
back of the pack.

“We had some bad luck,”
said Gulden, “but even so we
weren’t aggressive enough.”

Despite this last loss, Gulden

the game with a bruised shoulder.
He is improving and will probably
see some action in tomorrow’s
game.

Bucknell’s second touch-
down in the quarter was sparked by
a Kevin Kane ‘93 fumble recovery
on the Lehigh 30-yard line. Seven
plays later, Henesey scored his sec-
ond touchdown in less than three
minutes, this time from five yards
out. Henesey leads the team this
season with five rushing touch-
downs. The touchdown run was set
up by passes from Hatajik to Dan
Scocca ‘91 and Pape of nine and 16
yards respectively, Hatajik was
able to connect with Walsh in the
endzone for a two-point conversion
bringing the score to 27-24.

Bucknell began again at its
own 34-yard line, with just under
seven minutes to play. The Bison
were able to march the distance of
the field while successfully manag-
ing the clock. During the 12-play
scoring drive, Hatajik threw only
three times, all for completions,
including a 15-yard connection
with Lester Erb ‘91. Henesey ran
the ball six times for 23 yards
including a six-yard gain on a
fourth down and one. The winning
score occurred when  Hatajik
scrambled into the endzone. The
extra point was missed, leaving the
score at 30-27. It was Todd Krutch-
koff's °91 first extra point miss
since the first game of the season.
His 31 consecutive conversions are
a Bucknell school record.

Lehigh began its last chance
at a score by returning the kickoff
to the Bucknell 43-yard line. The
Engineers marched the ball down
to the 16-yard line, giving Erik

Fiesta Bowl organizers’ con-
cers have been substantiated by
the indicated intent of Virginia and
Penn State, both previously proba-
ble Fiesta competitors, to attend
other post-season contests.

Virginia has expressed the
intent to compete in the richer

Orleans, while Penn State will
apparently receive almost $1 mil-

time deficit against Colgate to win
the game 40-39.

The game began badly as
Lehigh took the opening kickoff
and drove 57 yards in 12 plays, cul-
minating on a five-yard touchdown
run by Tom Cunningham. Lehigh
drove most of the way on the
ground, which was surprising, con-
sidering it brought the nation’s

Bucknell set up its first score
later in the quarter, as Mike Augs-

In what is a powerful state-
ment of the prevalence of athletics
in all facets of our society, this
issue has been adopted primarily by
the sports community as a vehicle
through which to exert political
influence.

Immediately following the
voting results, NFL Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue released a statement
which indicated that he would ask
the NFL owners to take punitive
measures against the state by mov-
ing the site of the 1993 Super Bowl
from Phoenix, as had originally
been determined.

In the statement Tagliabue
commented, “With the holiday ref-
erenda having been rejected Tues-
day I do not believe that playing
Super Bowl XXVII in Arizona is in
the best interest of the NFL.”

The Sunkist Fiesta Bowl,
held in Tempe, Arizona, is suffer-
ing more immediate blows as a
result of the widespread
Tepercussions.

This post-season college foot-
ball contest has a payoff of $2.5
million for each team, and has
hosted NCAA title games in 1987
and 1989,

derdale’s inaugural Blockbuster
Bowl.

In attempts to rectify a possi-
bly disastrous situation, Fiesta

be given to each

Louisville (9-1-1) had been
prepared to accept a bid to the All-
American Bowl in Birmingham,

“The NFL is open to hypocrisy. They say no
to the Super Bowl in Phoenix, yet they take
the money from the Cardinals’ home

games.”

—ESPN commentator Chris Berman Woried

posal, while others in the sports
world criticized the NFL
extensively

There are those who feel the
NFL has overstepped its boundar-
ies by entering the political arena.
ESPN commentator and former
NFL quarterback Joe Theismann
exclaimed, “The NFL owners are
trying to dictate political policy to
the state. It’s blackmail.”

Chris Berman, host of
ESPN’s NFL Gameday, lashed out
at the league stating, “The NFL is
open to hypocrisy. They say no to
the Super Bow! in Phoenix, yet
take the money from Cardinals’
home games.”

Smolka echoed these senti-
ments by remarking, “I don’t think
{the NFL] can move the Super
Bowl from [Phoenix], while they
still have an NFL team _ there.
There seems to be an
inconsistency.”

Bucknell football coach Lou
Maranzana gave his assessment of
the situation by stating, “The NFL
is still a money-making organiza-
tion and what
they are doing is
covering their
public relations
backsides
because they are
about
what it is ulti-

have

for tinggty “ernie mately going to

students.

The bowl agenda, Junker
explained, will include a pregame
ceremony honoring the 200th anni-
versary of the Bill of Rights as well
as a halftime ceremony in remem-
brance of Dr. King.

Bucknell Sports Information
Director Bo Smolka sympathizes
with the Fiesta Bowl personnel’s
predicament, stating, “The Fiesta
Bowl is put in a bad position
because they didn’t have anything
to do with the voting and actually
they have a good track record in
terms of hiring minorities in man-
agement positions and such.”

It is worth noting that the

Alabama, yet when the Fiesta Bowl
became an option, the Aill-
American Bowl’s_ payoff of
$600,000 paled in comparison to
that of the Fiesta.

Louisville Head Coach
Howard Schnellenberger remarked,
“The Fiesta Bowl pays $2.5 million
and you have to look at that. We
want to go to a bowl where we
have the opportunity to play the
best football team we can play.”

Tagliabue’s recommendation
to strip Arizona of the 1993 Super
Bowl has become an issue of great
controversy. Several NFL owners
have expressed their intention to go
along with the commissioner’s pro-

mean to
cents.”

While the Fiesta Bowl
seems to have weathered the ini-
tial storm, the controversy cer-
tainly does not appear to have
been completely resolved. Many
questions regarding the NFL’s
apparent double-standard in Ari-
zona remain unaddressed.

Whatever the outcome of
this situation may be, it remains a
travesty that there still exist three

S.T.O.P. continues activism,
war may be on the horizon

U.N. authorizes the use of force in the Gulf: students to
protest 4 to 5:30 p.m. today at Post Office

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

The United Nations Security
Council voted twelve to two, with
one abstention, in favor of using
“all necessary means” to remove
Iraq from Kuwait, if they do not
voluntarily leave by January 15th,
has caused the peace movement on
campus to alter their approach
According to Sarah Pryor ’92 of
Students and Teachers Organized
for Peace (S.T.O.P.), Thursday’s
Security Council resolution shifted
the organization’s focus to the task
of explicitly promoting peaceful
alternatives in the face of the
increasing national momentum
toward war.

While recognizing that given
the U.N. backing of the latest step
in the Persian Gulf Crisis their
voice of protest is likely to be in the
minority, late this week members
of S.T.O.P. undertook projects
encouraging the community to
question the course of events

unfolding in the Persian Gulf.

On Thursday moming  stu-
dents found the academic quad
chalked with messages written by
S.T.0.P. concerning the composi-
tion and purpose of the U.N. forces
in the Persian Gulf. Today, in
response to the Security Council
vote, a banner was erected on the
lawn between the Langone Center
and Marts Hall and a demonstration
and candle-light vigil is to be held
from 4 to 5:30 p.m. in front of the
post office on Market Street.

The ends S.T.O.P. hopes to
achieve through its efforts, accord-
ing to member Stephen Leshinski
“91, are varied but there are two
foci; one of which is to do what is
realistically possible to prevent mil-
itary conflict in the Persian Gulf.
The second is to develop a commu-
nity of persons against war in the
Gulf.

“Right now we are establish-
ing a voice so, if there is a war,
people will look back to November
and see that at the very beginning

there were people in opposition,”
Leshinski said. With the engage-
ment of the conflict Leshinski
believes that opposition will rise
and that it is important at the
present moment to create a founda-
tion upon which future action can
be taken.

The beginning of such a com-
munity of opposition began two
weeks ago when S.T.O.P. orga-
nized a week of demonstrations and
educational forums which culmi-
nated in a day-long “teach-in” on
Saturday Nov. 17 which discussed
the many political, cultural, and
economic facets of the conflict in
the Persian Gulf. The proceedings
of the day were covered by local
network affiliates and televised that
night.

Members of S.T.O.P. are also
concerned that students are not tak-
ing the conflict with Iraq seriously
Mollie Janota “91 stated that “peo-
ple are still not willing to think that
war is a real possibility.” Yet,

Summer program attracts
diverse group of students

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

Of the 25 students from the
Community College of Philadel-
phia(CCP) who attended Buck-
nell’s summer school session, four
transferred this Fall and another
seven will arrive in the Spring.
Using a $25,000 Ford Foundation
grant, Bucknell sponsored this sum-
mer school program in affiliation
with CCP. The four students who
now attend Bucknell are. Alonzo
Pride, Colleen Lyttleton, Anwar
Aberra, and Juarrannetta McNabb.

The program, modeled after a
similar one set up at Vassar Col-
lege, gave minority and low-
income students an opportunity to
study at a four-year private institu-
tion. “The intent of the program
was to identify students at commu-
nity colleges whose achievements
indicated that they were capable of
finishing a bachelor’s degree,” said
Richard Smith, professor of Eng-
lish and coordinator of the project.

Smith pointed out that most
of the students involved in the pro-
gram were capable of succeeding at
a four-year college, but because of
financial or familial limitations,
had not considered the possibility.
These students would end their
education with associate degrees.

The summer program “‘intro-

duced them to the atmosphere of a
private four-year school by having

Heiter predicts arrests

Borough meeting shows Town/Gown fallout from
Halloween incident

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer -

The near riot on Halloween
May generate arrests said Lewis-
burg Police Chief Donald Heiter.
“Persons who live in that area” may
be charged with alcohol-related
offenses. Heiter also said that “‘it is
up to the District Attorney to
decide whether furnishing alcohol
to students of that age contributed
to the [near] ... riot.”

The Daily Item (Wednesday,
November 21) paraphrased Heiter
as saying that videotape footage
from local news crews and media
services would be used in the inves-
tigation, but he insisted, “There
isn’t anything we would use for
charges in this part.”

Heiter defended police con-
duct, as well as the lack of arrests
to date at a Borough Council meet-
ing Tuesday November 20. He
explained later that “there were a
lot of things to consider. There
were other people I was taking
information from.” Heiter also
menuoned several contributing fac-
tors that lead to his decision not to
make arrests. “We were waiting
until we had the forces available for

Gift Drive
tops goal

By Natalie Dunlap
Staff Writer

The *91 Senior Gift Drive
reached its goal of $115,000 on
Wednesday, November 15. In the
past three months, 75.8% of the
senior class was contacted about
pledging to the Senior Gift Drive,
and of those contacted, 68%
pledged money to the drive.

Chris Daniels, chairman of
the Senior Gift Drive, explained the
rough time that the coordinators
and other volunteers had in asking
for pledges, “Because of all the
changes at Bucknell, a lot of people
didn’t want to give back to Buck-
nell. We went out and campaigned
and changed opinions by convinc-
ing them to give money where they
wanted to give it.”

Maggie Rislow, assistant
director of Annual Giving, gives
credit to Daniels and his staff for
their organizing and campaigning
of this project, “The coordinators
and volunteers have worked really
hard on this, and that’s why it has
been successful.”

The remaining 24.2% of the
senior class will be contacted next
semester about pledging.

Since September 16, the Gift
Drive’s 15 coordinators and well
over 100 other volunteers have
been organizing the drive and cam-
paigning for pledges.

Because tuition covers only
70% of the costs for attending
Bucknell, the Senior Gift Drive is
especially important. _Rislow
explained, “The point of the Senior

the charge, and we were looking
for the cooperation of the students
and administration.” Heiter did say
that he hoped students understood
“there’ll not be a second! If they
didn’t understand that we meant
business, fine.”

Laura Messier, a member of
the Town/Gown Committee who
called in the original complaint,
explained that although the situa-
tion was problematic for the police,
different things might have been
done. “Everybody was really glad
that nobody got hurt, that there was
no baton bashing. The only prob-
lem was that there really wasn’t
law and order.” Messier also ques-
tioned the original handling of the
situation. “Within 45 minutes the
number of students increased from
300 to about 500... The police
made no attempt to cordon off the
area to keep the crowd from grow-
ing. They could have reduced the
number by almost half.”

“My perception was that
when President Sojka came the
whole tone of the thing changed,”
said Messier. In terms of the calls
for a harder line, she noted, “If
laws are broken and he’s aware of
it, he has to take action, and many
many laws were broken.” At the
same time, Messier said that she
understood, “Simply arresting a
bunch of students wouldn't have
solved anything.”

Messier, who was outspoken
at the Council meeting, thought that

the arrests were “too much after the
fact. I think it’s kind of like locking
the barn door after the horse is
out.”

Heiter stressed the educa-
ional value of such an expericnce,
and he hopes students have learned
the risks involved in breaking the
law in town, He explained that the
police department receives weekly
requests for the records of former
students. “[A criminal record]
could put them out of a good job
some time in the future.”

Messier said that the overall
“town reaction” would be “very
difficult to assess, because the next
scheduled town/gown meeting isn’t
until January.” She did say that
“it’s causing us to put more pres-
sure on the university to try to get
the residency requirement stricter
As a result of what happened, we
put forth a proposal to ask them
[the administration] why they can’t
do it in [impose the residency
requirement] 1991.”

Heiter explained that no cam-
pus raids were likely in the future
“We go on campus any time we’re
called. We do patrol once in a
while...” He explained that they
could be called by “Bucknell
Security, East Buffalo Township
Police, the LCB (Liquor Control
Board), or the State Police.” One
consequence of police involvement
on campus according to Heiter is
that, “Where we get called, we will
be the ones to issue the citations...”

Bojar addresses
diversity, curriculum

By Lisa Hirschkorn
Staff Writer

With her speech, “The Mean-
ing of Cultural Literacy in a Multi-
cultural Society,” Dr. Karen Bojar
advocated = curriculum reform
amidst the fierce educational
debates occurring at Universities
across the country, including Buck-
nell, Dr. Bojar, associate professor
of English at the Community Col-
lege of Philadelphia, addressed the
key issue and criticism surrounding
a core curriculum versus an integra-
tion of perspectives, while focusing
on the views of best-selling authors
Allen Bloom and E.D. Hirsch at the
Olin Science Auditorium on Mon-
day night.

The national consensus that
our curriculum must become more
multicultural is growing, but the
perspective from which these tradi
tions should be taught is the emerg-
ing battleground, in which the issue
of cultural literacy is the first battle
to be won.

“Should the U.S. exist as an
American culture to which all
groups must more or less adapt, or
should it be viewed as a multicultu-
ral society comprised of a wide
range of ethnic groups with no one
group in a position of cultural dom-
inance? This is the underlying ques-
tion,” Bojar said. “And it is no coin-
cidence that the debate over cultural

literacy has erupted as our society
becomes increasingly anxious over
changing demographics,” Bojar
added.

She explained that the major
reform movements in American
education occurred during periods
of increasing cultural diversity

The two beginning phases of
educational reform, in the 1840’s
and at the tum of the twentieth cen-
tury, were motivated by fears of
diverse groups assimilating into the
society. This first phase, known as
the Common School Movement,
involved Irish immigrants, and the
second phase was motivated by
concerns about assimilating immi-
grant workers from Southern and
Eastern Europe.

These xenophobic
which our ancestors possessed have
largely prompted the contemporary
debate over cultural literacy. The
term Cultural Literacy, which Bojar
and her colleagues implemente
back in 1985, has acquired
politcal dimensions and “unfortu
nately, these issues are frequently
presented on a simplistic left-right
terms.”

“We were regarded as reac
tionaries,” Bojar explained. “Most
people found cultural literacy as a
code for right-wing agenda. We
were greatly relieved when support

trustee debate

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Last week’s biannual meei-
ing of the Board of Trustees
‘sparked controversy and heated
)debate on the issue of student fee
increases for the coming year. The
trustees met November 16-17 and
faced “the most difficult issue that
a trustee can face,” according to
James Nevels, a member of the
board.

The — trus-
tces were asked
to pass the
faculty’s —_ pro-
‘posed 6.93%
jincrease in the
comprehensive
fee which
‘includes tuition,
room and board.
Instead, accord-
ing to Nevels,
“The administra-
tion is going to
go back and
we're going to
look at a tuition
increase that
approximates the
level of
inflation”

which is
currently around
4.5%. Nevels
explained that
the proposal had
to be viewed in
the context of
two key issues,
“First, demo-
graphics; the
number of col-
lege age students is dwindling.
Secondly, our competition is
increasing. Bucknell’s level of
endowment, while not small, is
not Harvard’s....”

These two issues serve to
work against each other, according
to Nevels. In a time of decreasing
demand and increased competi-

ing fees.

tion, Bucknell’s “budget is primar-

Friday, November 30

C. Bridgewater/The BKN every

- Trustee James Nevels analyzed
the various issues surrounding
the ongoing debate over increas-

ily a tuition driven budget.”

Nevels described the job of
a trustee viewing the decision as a
“balancing act.... We want to keep
moving in the right direction, and
we must ask what is the level of
tuition increase that is acceptable
on the one hand and necessary [to
operate a university] on the
other.”

Another issue Nevels dis-
cussed was that of a fixed increase
versus a floating increase in fees.

By setting the
increase in rela-
tion to the infla-
tion rate, the
university
assures itself of
not losing
money. For
example, if
inflation went
up to 8%, a
fixed increase
of 6.93% would
result in an
actual loss in
fees for the
university.
Nevels
defended the
charge of con-
e troversy by
explaining that
“you find your-
self in a situa-
tion where
year
when we go
through this
question of
what to do with
tuition. We
always have a
very, intense discussion
about that, and this was no
exception.”

The apparent cuts in the pro-
Posed increases will necessarily
affect one of two major budget
additions that the faculty had
asked for: 25 more professor posi-
tions, and faculty raises.

Fee hikes prompt) University sponsors lecture series
on Gregg Township incinerator

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

The two sides in the contro-
versial Gregg Township hazardous
waste incinerator proposal met
face-to-face Nov. 20 in Vaughan
Lit. Auditorium in a informational
forum sponsored by the University
and coordinated by Michael
LaGrega, professor of civil engi-
neering. The lecture, the second in
a continuing series, featured separ-
ate presentations by Anthony Done-
telli, president of USPCI Pennsyl-
vania, Inc., the company proposing
the incinerator plan, and Clyde
Pecling, local naturalist and
founder of Organizations United
for the Environment (OUB), the cit-
izens’ group spearheading opposi-
tion to the incinerator. A question
and answer period followed the
presentations.

Donetelli’s portion of the
program focused on the criteria
involved in the selection of the site,
as well as a technical discussion of
how the incineration process
works. Donetelli explained that
USPCI chose the site in Gregg
Township, located in northern
Union County north of the village
of Allenwood, because the com-
pany wanted a site with approxi-
mately 500 to 1000 acres of land
suitable for the development of an
adjacent industrial park, which also
had good access to major highways
and railroads, in an “area which
could benefit from long-term
growth.” In addition, he said that
the property must be properly
zoned and available for purchase
by USPCI. Most importantly, Don-
atelli explained, the location must
meet “some of the most rigorous
siting criteria in the country” set by
the state Department of Environ-
mental Resources (DER). He con-
cluded by explaining that there
were six sites in five counties
which met these “extremely limited
criteria,” including another site in

Union County, and that the Gregg
Township site was selected from
that list.

Donatelli also defined the
types of waste the facility would
accept, a list which includes paint
residues, contaminated soil (such as
that around leaking underground
gasoline tanks), unused pesticides
and herbicides, petroleum wastes,
household chemicals, and chemical
wastes from industries such as dry
cleaning, printing, and wood
finishing.

Donatelli then outlined the
DER permitting procedure for the
facility, which is a two-step process
in which DER first determines the
Suitability of the site, after which
the developer, USPCI, can submit a
formal permit application, which is
then reviewed and acted upon.
According to Donatelli, the entire
process normally takes three to five
years,

In addition, Donatelli
explained USPCI’s “attempts to
establish a working relationship
with groups” in the area. He said
that these attempts have included
mailing out 4,000 information
packets and newsletters and hold-
ing a general public meeting last
month. Donatelli also said the com-
pany has met with local officials
and held regular meetings for the
local media, as well as meetings
with other interested groups and
organizations and door-to-door
contact with area citizens.

Dr. Joseph Santoleri, a con-
sultant employed by USPCI for the
project, then explained some of the
more technical details of hazardous
waste incineration. He explained
that the process “uses high temper-

ature oxidation” in which the haz-
ardous organic compounds are
fractured, with the inorganic com-
ponents left as ash, which will be
stored on-site in an above-ground
monofill. Federal standards, Santo-
Jeri said, require the incinerator
have “a 99.99 percent destructive
removal efficiency” of organic
compounds, and that the emission
control system must have a 99 per-
cent scrubbing efficiency for
hydrogen chloride, a volatile chem-
ical which, when released into the
air, can mix with water to form
acid rain. In addition, Santoleri
explained that, as a condition for
licensing, the plant must undergo a
“stack test” in which emissions are
tested in a “worst case scenario,”
in which the buming temperature
and type of waste are set for maxi-
mum levels of dangerous emis-
sions. Santoleri also explained that
the stack must feature continuous
monitoring for carbon monoxide,
total hydrocarbons, hydrogen chlo-
ride, oxygen, and opacity (whether
the stack emission is clear).

Pecling took a totally differ-
ent approach in his presentation,
claiming that the key issue is
“what's the character of the people
involved, the track record of the
company, [and] the track record of
the industry.” Addressing Dona-
telli directly, he said, ‘Your
involvement with Walter Norley
Suggests a tone of subterfuge and
deceit.”

Norley, a principal owner of
Pennwood Development Corpora-
tion, purchased the land for the 700
acre site from the various Owners.
USPCI, in tum, purchased the
entire tract from Pennwood, and

for cultural literacy came from an
unexpected source—Abbie Hoff-
man.” Although Hoffman never
used the term “cultural literacy”
himself, Bojar spoke of Hoffman’s
interview with National Public
Radio, right before his death, where
he complained that American stu-
dents were ignorant of their own
history. Hoffman remarked, “Peo-
ple say things to me like I know
who Martin Luther King is because
I watched this television show, Eyes
on the Prize, but tell me who is this
guy Malcolm the tenth [Malcolm
X

This fiery curriculum debate
is usually, but not always, drawn
along left-right terms, explained
Bojar. Support for the canon, for
instance, is largely derived from the
right-wingers, those who aspire to
an Allen Bloom/William Bennett
philosophy. Bloom is the author of
the best-selling book, The Closing
of the American Mind, which
espoused the need for “canonical
works,” and a return to cultural tra-
dition. Bloom’s views also identify
with those of William Bennett, the
former Secretary of Education, and
Ronald Reagan.

However, E.D. Hirsch, a pro-
fessor at the University of Virginia,
politically lies to the left of Bloom.
In his best-selling book, Cultural
Literacy, he also focused on the
importance of a historical back-
ground, and included a 5,000-word
list of dates, places, phrases, terms,
and concepts which he believed
informed citizens should know.
According to Bojar, “Hirsch dem-
onstrated that literacy, with all of its
fundamentals, does have a cultural
dimension. Writers take certain his-
torical information for granted, and
readers who do not possess this
information suffer a great gap in
communication. Although the very
term cultural literacy is problematic
in a multicultural society, Hirsch
had done us a service in pointing

this out.”

Yet, Bojar believes the critics
have misinterpreted Hirsch and bet-
ter identifies with his philosophy
rather than Bloom’s views. “Con-
cerned with a broad-based demo-
cratic leadership,” Hirsch is sensi-
women, minorities,
economically-disadvantaged, and
an unusually extreme aversion to
Ronald Reagan.” Bojar believes
that Hirsch has been a “victim of
his books and success” because
people associate his name only
with his infamous list, and ignore
the rest of his book. Hirsch’s list
“doesn’t go far enough” and con-
Jures up images of teachers forcing
their students to memorize what
she calls “a list of 5000 things that
savvy folk ought to know.”

While critics tend to conflate
the differences between Hirsch and
Bloom, Bojar asserts that she is
struck by the differences between
the two men. “How many people
have actually gotten through Allen
Bloom’s Closing of the American
Mind?” Bojar asked her audience.
“It happens to be the least-read
best-seller of all time.” According
to Bojar, “Bloom focuses on the
privileged few. He openly states in
the introduction to his book that his
concern is with college students
and professors, a cadre of elite stu-
dents.” Bloom is interested in
schools like Bucknell but not in
schools like Bojar’s, a community
college.

One good point on Bloom,
Bojar said, is his attack on relati-
vism. Using the analogy of a stu-
dent who claims “well, it’s just my
Opinion” Bojar explained that a stu-
dent does need criteria for her opin-
ion. And Bloom establishes this cri-
teria with his emphasis on
canonical works.

Despite criticisms of the
canonical works, “the books we are
supposed to have read,” Bojar
believes that curriculum reform
should maintain a canon because of
its universal value. “How is literary
value established? Who decides
what a masterpiece is going to be?”
asked Bojar.

Bojar herself is not yet ready
to abandon the canon or the notion
of universal value. She claims there
is “some reason why certain works
have spoken to so many people
across generations. Yet, recent
work in the humanities and social
sciences has discredited the notion

tive ‘to

the company claims that this was
their first contact with Norley. Peel-
ing and OUE, however, claim that
Norley served as a front man for
USPCI, so that the land could be
purchased without the plans for the
site being known, a claim Norley
and USPCI refute. Peeling, how-
ever, noted that Pennwood shares
the same phone number as Environ-
mental Services, Inc., a consulting
firm in which Donatelli is one of
the principals. Peeling also claimed
that USPCI prevented a member of
OUE from taking a soil sample at
the site.

Peeling outlined numerous
safety violations by USPCI at other
facilities it owns, which included
“at least 40 violations between
April 1984 and May 1987.” Peeling
also noted that some sites owned by
Union Pacific, USPCI’s parent
company, are on the Environmental
Protection Agency’s federal “super-
fund” list of the most contaminated
Sites in the nation. After elaborating
on several of USPCI’s violations,
Peeling concluded that the company
“has a patter of non-compliance
and negotiations for lower fines.”
He also noted that the mayor of
Logan Township, New Jersey,
where a similar hazardous waste
incinerator is located, told OUE
members, “It can’t do your commu-
nity any good.”

In conclusion, Peeling said,
“The track record of this industry is
not a pretty picture. We’re not will-
ing to take a chance with USPCI;
your political connections don’t
impress us.... This incinerator
Poses a risk to the entire population
of this valley, [and] you choose to
impose that risk on us.”

of an unchanging universal human
nature.” For example, Bojar said
“the racism of Huckleberry Finn,
the anti-semitism of The Merchant
of Venice and the misogyny of Par-
adise Lost” are the charges against
the classic books which most
Americans regard as masterpieces.
She said that at “more cutting edge
graduate schools such as Duke
courses in westerns and Avon
romances proliferate.” She sees
diminishing distinctions between
high and low cultures and added,
“Stephen King has started to creep
into contemporary literature
courses.”

“Classic works can be found
outside the mainstream,” Bojar
asserted in addressing the value of
inclusivity. “There are works that
are classics of African-American
literature and of Native-American
literature which demand the same
attention as Huckleberry Finn and
The Scarlet Letter.”

The ultimate question lies in
how these new perspectives will be
mandated and expanded into the
college curriculum. “The hot issue
is now becoming the perspective
from which these views are taught.
Unul recently, the quarrel over the
place of Western classics has been
restricted to primarily elite institu-
tions such as Stanford but now it
seems to be shifting toward public
universities.”

Bojar used the recent actions
by the New York Education task
force to illustrate one possible rem-
edy for this problem of exclusivity.
In rather blunt language, the task
force proposed a new curriculum
concentrating on the contributions
of minorities to correct the “mis-
education of all known people
through a systematic bias to a Euro-
pean culture and its derivatives,”
The report aims at criticizing and
de-emphasizing both the impact
and the institutions of American
history.

Yet Bojar is uneasy about a
separatist approach which empha-
sizes the history and perceptions of
one particular ethnic group. “In
conclusion, I want to embrace
diversity but I would also like to
see some shared knowledge base—
a broader more culturally diverse
core but a core nonetheless. I want
my students to have access to tradi-
tional classics, and I want a broad
range of new voices—in short I
want it all.”

Fuel fire extin-
guished in Colo.

A huge fire that burned
unchecked for two days was extin-
guished Wednesday at Denver's Sta-
pleton Airport with the help of firc-
fighting specialists from Texas.

Two jet fuel tanks had been on
fire since Monday. The fire had
begun when two 400,000-gallon
tanks crupted in flame Sunday. The
four tanks, containing more than two
million gallons of jet fuel, were part
of the airport’s fuel storage farm.

The storage area is about one
half mile north of the airport’s
terminal.

Water and foam sprays were
trained on an 800,000-gallon tank
that was one-third to one-half full of
jet fuel and a tank that held 350,000
gallons of fuel Firefighters
attempted to keep the burning tanks
cool so that a five-man team flown
to Denver from Texas could get
close in order to seal broken valves

on the tanks. The sprays worked
better than expected — they put
out the flames

Collins’ show charmed audience

By Lydia Neuman
Staff Writer

Today’s college-age students
missed the debut of Judy Collins
but grew up in a world of musical
waters permanently tinged by the
magic of Collins and her
contemporaries.

On Friday, November 16 the
Weis Center’s stage, bathed in gold
light, was graced by a figure in
black velvet. With a soon-familiar
toss of gray-blond hair, Collins
seated herself at the piano and
embarked solo, on a journey
through “The Blizzard”, the piece

that heads her latest album, Fires of

Eden. A four-member orchestra
drifted onstage in mid-song and as
each roused his or her instrument
from sleep into reverberation, new
and awesome dimensions spun
around the core of a crystalline
voice. Embodied at the outset were
the elements that characterize Col-
lins’ virtuosity: narrative
emotional delivery and

lyrics,
superb

musicianship. “The Blizzard” was
composed, as noted on her album,
“out of my lifetime love affair with
a good story and from my passion
for the mountains.”

After forgetting the second
line of “Chelsea Morning” in what
Collins winningly termed “my
excitement over that first song,”
she went on to perform other high-
lights from Fires of Eden in addi-
tion to her older classics and bor-
rowings from The Beatles, Joni
Mitchell and Linda Griffith

Standouts among her original
compositions included an a cc
piece accompanied by the poig
nantly majestic voices of whales, a
recording presented to her as a gift
from a friend. Her respect for, and
enchantment with,
affirmed through innovations like
this one and through actions such
as donating a portion of Fires of
Eden profits to The Garden of Eden
Planet Foundation. The Founda-
tion, co-established by Collins, will
use this money to plant seedlings in

By Danna Frangione

Live vicariously this season
with a feisty, fast paced Bucknell
Dance Company concert featuring
tongue-in-cheek tap, irreverent jazz
and delicately moody modern bal-
let. The fall season performances
will run next Friday and Saturday
in the University Theatre in Cole-
man Hall. The performances repre-
sent an ambitious semester of guest
residencies and lengthy rehearsals
for the cast of twenty-one students
and faculty.

Highlighting the concert is a
premier by guest artist-in-residence
Chris Kaufman, who joins forces
with Bucknell Resident Poet Lisa
Coffman in presenting “With God
and Gladys.” An_ experimental
piece with harsh overtones, the
dance explores the tenuous connec-
tions between mind and body.
Kaufman, with Bucknell seniors
Tina Henninger and Sharon Nich-
ols, will perform the trio framed by
Coffman’s reading of her work
“Brother Ass.”

Guest artist Richard Bull will
offer his perpetually fresh perspec-
tive via a fall workshop in perfor-
mance improvisation sponsored by
the Bucknell Association for the
Arts. Setting only broad guidelines,
Bull utilizes an assortment of Bach
fugues to showcase the concentra-
tion and split-second timing
required to spontancously create
new movement “on the spot” in
“The Well-Tempered Dancers.”

The extremely complex, and
perhaps controversial “MaDonna

Colorado

Environmental issues are not
the only ones Collins addresses; in
accordance with her position as a
pacifist, she prefaced several songs
with references to the crisis in the
Persian Gulf and executed “Fortune
of Soldiers”, whose lyrics insist
“When they said that peace was
just a dream... they didn’t know
about you.” Perhaps this “you” is
every one of us.

After declaring her personal
admirauon for Bette Midler, “the
woman who taught Cyndi Lauper
how to dress,” Collins explained
that soon after recording From A
Distance, her producer called and
asked, “Guess who just released
that as a single?” This same sce-
nario had played itself out earlier
when quite coincidentally, Midler
beat Collins to the release of “The
Wind Beneath My Wings”.

Inspiration came to Collins
through songs sung by her father
while shaving (She played her
favorite among these) and guest

Reed Show,” produced by a team
of choreographers and__ scenic
designers, presents a farcical MTV
look at the sexual fantasies sur-
rounding women.

Fast-paced, raunchy, and
irreverent, this shocking piece is
complete with costumes of cami-
soles and garter belts. The work
features students Tomoaki Osuga
’90 and Geofry Glenn ’90 as voy-
eurs, and it promises both theatrical
appeal and controversy.

The performance will also
feature the return of tap dance to
Bucknell with sophomore Janelle
Oltorik’s “Misbehavin.” The piece
is a colorful quartet set to music by
Fats Waller. More new student cho-

reography includes junior Joni
Hong’s “All That Glitters,” a
1950’s style jazz picce about three
sexy women competing for attcn-
tion, and senior Jennifer Ferland’s
contemporary suite set to music by
Enya entitled “L’Au-dela.” Senior
Jason Aten creates both set design
and lighting for the latter two
pieces.

Assistant Professor of Dance,
Danna Frangione and Shellie Cash-
Muller will premier two new
works. Frangione’s “Castaway”
uses traditional Irish music to paint
an expressionistic picture of a par-
ticular landscape of Northwest Ire-
land known as the Burren. Remote
and stark, this great limestone pla-

tcau bordering on the sca is famous
for its shipwrecks and eccentric
locals. Designer F. Elaine Wil-
tiams, associate professor of theatre
and director of theatre contributes
her skill both to costume design for
“Castaway” and set design for
Cash-Muller’s “At the Door.” Per-
formed by senior Tina Henninger,
the solo work is a clear-eyed, bru-
tally honest look at unrequited love.

The concert also showcases
the lighting designs of new Depart-
ment of Theatre and Dance Light-
ing Designer/Technical Director
Steven Draheim and set and cos-
tume designs of Director of Theatre
F, Elaine Williams. Curtain is at 8
p.m.

musicians on his radio show. In
1968, she decided to attempt song-
writing on a whim, previously of
the conviction that “there were
enough songs around to be sung.”
Her piano teacher discouraged her
ambitious student from developing
a repertoire that incorporated com-
posers other than Mozart and Bee-
thoven. Years later, this woman
would attend her famous pupils’
concerts only to “clasp my hands,
look into my eyes and say wist-
fully, ‘Little Judy, you really could
have gone places.’”

Audience-anticipated _rendi-
tions of “Both Sides Now” and
“Send In The Clowns” were worthy
of the excitement they induced,
although the latter came only after
several minutes of imploring
applause once Collins had left the
stage. The concert concluded after
arriving full-circle at a reprise of
“The Blizzard”, an anthem of
romance and Rocky Mountain win-
ter that simultaneously eclipsed and
illuminated all the music that lay
within its peripheries.

Celebrate the harvest

By Shirin Kambin

Kwanzaa is the only nation-
aly recognized cultural holiday
which is neither religious, political
nor heroic. Translated from Kiswa-
hili to mean “‘the first fruits of the
harvest,” it is a community cele-
bration of African-American cul-
ture. It was founded in 1966 by Dr.
Maulana Karenga, a black studies
professor who considers himself a
cultural nationalist. Kwanzaa is
uniquely American and is being
celebrated here at Bucknell, where
it is sponsored by the African
American Cultural society and the
Multiculture center. The celebra-
tion began this past Monday and
will continue through the weekend.

There are seven principles
associated with Kwanzaa, and each
of these principles are being cele-
brated this week. The principles
cover unity, both within the family

and on a broader scale, self-
determination, responsibility, coop-
erative economics, purpose, crea-
tivity, and faith.

In celebration of Kwanzaa
and the principles which it recog-
nizes there have been a number of
events on campus this past week.
Karen Bojar, brought to campus
with the help of the Pennsylvania
Humanities Council, gave a presen-
tation on Monday about “The
Meaning of Cultural Literacy in a
Multiculture Society.” In addi-
tion,the film, Gotta Make that
Journey: Sweet Honey in the Rock
was shown on Tuesday.

There will also be a number
of principle readings each night
this weekend. These readings will
be done by various students at 7
p.m. in Seventh Street House. All
are welcome to attend to learn
more about the celebration of
Kwanzaa.

“Grafitti” says it all

Prince’s new album shines strong

By Matt Wood

Let’s face it, whether you
like Prince or not, he’s a rhythm
and blues artist of considerable
merit. Purple Rain and Sign of the
Times are two of the finest albums
ever produced. It’s only too fre-
quently that
humming along with songs like
“Raspberry Beret” and “Little
Red Corvette” when they come
on the radio.

Unfortunately, Prince’s lat
est efforts, “Batman” and “Love-
sexy” were not at all representa-
tive of his great talent. Devoid of
continuity and hits, one might
wonder if Prince has in fact lost
his rhythm. Much to the delight of
many, he has responded with an
album that is reminiscent of his
Previous style and offers some
hope that he hasn’t lost himself in
the confines of Paisley Park after
all.

you find yourself

The new album, Graffiti
Bridge, serves as the soundtrack
to the forthcoming movie of the
same name. Though the movie
itself is supposed to be a sequel to
Purple Rain, the album doesn’t
seem to kindle many of the same
vibes as its predecessor. This may
be interpreted negatively, but
rather it only is meant to stress the
unique qualitics of Graffiti
Bridge

Another noteworthy differ-
ence between Grafitti Bridge and
Purple Rain is that there are a
whopping seventeen songs. At the
same time, listeners may be sur-
prised to find that only about half

of these songs are performed by
Prince. The others are the prod-
ucts of Prince’s Paisley Park
Playmates, Morris Day and the
ime, as well as numerous other
female vocalists. The Time add a
few solid tracks, but their pres-
ence is generally annoying and
distracting. On the other hand,
the female artists add hand-
to the quality of the
The most notable track is
one titled “Round and Round” by
evin Campbell; expect to hear
more from her. For the most part,
Prince’s own efforts are quite
good. “Can’t Stop,” “Elephants
and Flowers,” and, of course,
“Thieves in the Temple” are all
solid bets. “The Question of U”
and “Joy In Repetition” are both
excellent slow songs in keeping
with past efforts such as “Purple
Rain” (the sc nd “The Ballad
of Dorothy Parker” (Sign of the
Times). “New Power Generation”
(Parts I and II) will rock the
dance clubs

On the whole, there is
plenty of good music to be
enjoyed from this album. Though
iL is just a cut below “Purple
Rain” and “Sign of the Times,”
minus the obnoxious Morris Day
clan, this is a composition crea-
tively written and performed. The

Muncy’s Quakers experience ( g(jj171; |
community in confinement

By Rob Schroeder
Staff Writer

The State Correctional Insti-
tute for women in nearby Muncy,
Pennsylvania, and the Quaker sect
of Christianity are two things few
Bucknellians think frequently
about. Yet independently and
together, the prison and the Quak-
ers are an important part of our
small town community here. To
many of us, though, a prison is a
foreboding and _ fear-inspiring
place; a place we intend to stay out
of and away from. Moreover, prob-
ably very few of us have had the
experience of attending a Quaker
meeting and know little about their
ways. “What connection do the
Quakers and the prison have?” you
might be asking. The connections
are faith, a need for and a love of
silence, and a community of
friends. The Lewisburg Quaker
meeting (as well as the Pennsdale
and Millville meetings) have devel-
oped a special relationship with the
inmates of the State Correctional
Institute at Muncy through the
unique Quaker faith. I recently
went to the prison to find out why,
and how.

For the group of approxi-
mately 20 women at the Quaker
meeting I attended, the sense of
community and fellowship seemed
to be the main attraction to the unu-
sual sect. The Quakers and their
meeting and openness provide an
alternative to the inmates’ “deadly
routine form of life,” as Lewisburg
meeting member Barry Bishop
described it. Indeed, upon walking
into the prison’s chapel, where the
meeting was held, I immediately
felt like I was among a close knit
group. Everyone smiled, and the
women were glad to see old friends
and a new face. The inmates
warmly shook my hand and smiled
at me. There was no threat, no
intimidation and no fright. True to
Quaker form, the meeting sat in

silence with occasional monologues
for one half hour. The other half
hour was composed of conversation
and catching up with each other
During the total hour, and through
previous talks with members of the
Lewisburg meeting, I got a good
sense of what the two groups meant
to each other.

Even though there is “‘a lot to
choose from in the way of religious
expression” at the prison, the Quak-
ers were actually asked by the
inmates to come and hold meetings.
There was nothing at the prison that
addressed “how we [inmates] felt
and what we believed; what we
were concerned about,” said the
woman who initially confronted the
prison Chaplain with her spiritual
dilemmas. (Her name as well as

every other prisoner’s must be
withheld.) Hers was not the only
reaction against other Christian
sects. Another inmate told me that
the Quaker meeting’s “atmosphere
was much more pleasant,” and that
she could “worship in [her] own
fashion.” Several other women ha
revolted against their former faiths,

idl

particularly the strict Catholic
denomination. Though only con-
fined to the institution’s grounds
for an hour, it certainly seemed like
these women had their share of
stringent regulations. Visitors pass
through a metal detector after they
have had a prior security clearance.
Members of religious sects are not
allowed to write, call, or visit
except at the designated times of
worship. They are not even allowed

to learn the prisoners’ first names.
All is strict and impersonal. The
Quakers, though, “have some inter-
est in who [the prisoners] are...
{and] don’t try to change them as
people.” Since individual enlighten-
ment and lack of creed are major
facets of the Quaker life, their faith
is an important alternative to relig-
ious life at Muncy.

Even though every woman at
Muncy has been found guilty of a
crime by our justice system and is
thereby incarcerated, some inmates
are not without a sense of freedom.
The weekly meeting is a welcome
and liberating break from the tough
routine of prison life. The freedom
is both religious and personal, a
chance to rejoice in beliefs and a
chance to talk out problems and
concerns. One woman spoke in a
loud, strong voice during the meet-
ing, her eyes shut tight: “He [God]
give[s] you peace,” she said, “He
set[s] you free even though we
{are] in prison.” “I never been so
free in my life as when I accepted
the Lord into my life,” she went on
to say, “even though I’m in prison.
I wouldn’t give the Lord up for
nothin’ else in the world.” Other
members nodded, some lost in her
words, some still searching them-
selves for their own convictions or
solutions. Clearly, through the
silence of a Quaker meeting, these
women and others had found a faith
that liberated and accepted rather
than controlled and condemned.
That, I gathered from looking at
some of the hardened faces tumed
soft, is the connection of the Quak-
ers and the women at Muncy. That
is why the women asked them there
and why they keep coming back.
As a Lewisburg meeting member
told me, they are “trying to create
some sort of community.” And
behind the barbed wire fence of the
State Correctional Institute at
Muncy, a community is indeed
what I found.

Exploring the ghost of Hunt Halll

Custodians claim to have seen the spirit of a deceased girl who once

lived in room 346

By Jen Marshall
Staff Writer

Ready for a good ghost
story? Well, have a seat, tum on a
lot of lights, and make sure you’re
not on the third floor of the south
wing of Hunt Hall.

Before the real tale is told,
the false stories cluttering the sad
history of the ghost of Hunt Hall
should be made known, and then
dismissed forever. A lot of people
know bits and pieces of what really
happened and then have invented
or guessed the rest. Most everyone
agrees that a young woman died on
a dark, rainy night and that now her
ghost haunts a certain hall of Hunt.
Not many agree on why she died,
or even how she died. Some say
that while waiting for her parents
to pick her up for break, she fell
into the stream that runs alongside
Hunt and drowned. Others contend
that the accident happened a really
long time ago and that she was in a
horse and buggy accident. Closer
to the actual truth, yet another
source believes that a prankster
called the young woman home
with false news of her brother’s
death. While the unfortunate girl
was returning to Bucknell after dis-
covering the hoax, she supposedly
died in a car accident. None of

these versions of the tragedy that
took place on that black night are
true.

The only written material on
this subject that I found was a short
article written in the 1983 July/
August issue of Bucknell World, the
alumni magazine. The article con-
tained little more than a description
of the ghost, and none of the details
of that fateful night. Marsha Gori,
editor of Bucknell World, knew the
real story, though, because that
short article had evoked some pain-
ful memories for one of the dead
woman’s sorority sisters. This sister
wrote Marsha a long, sad, and fact-
filled letter about the young
woman’s death. Marsha Gori would
like the names of both the deceased
and the letter-writer to remain anon-
ymous out of respect for their fam-
ily and friends. Anyway, this is the
REAL story of the ghost of Hunt
Hall...

The rain hadn’t stopped once
all day, and its depressing clamor
continued into the late evening. A
young woman let her eyes stray
from her textbook and she smiled as
she looked at her Greek letters.
“How nice”, she thought, “it is to
be a Kappa Delta”. She stared again
at her homework in frustration and
wished that it were 1967, because
then she would be done with books

and graduating from Bucknell.
“But,” she said fondly to herself,
“T'll miss living on the south wing
of Hunt Hall in room 346.” The
loud ring of the telephone inter-
rupted the young woman’s wander-
ing thoughts. She answered the
phone, hoping to talk with a friend,
but instead learned of yet another
tragedy that had befallen her fam-
ily. Three weeks earlier, her mother
had committed suicide, and now
someone was calling to tell her that
her brother had been found dead on
her mother’s fresh grave.

Grabbing a raincoat and her
car keys, the young woman rushed
from her dorm to go home for the
funeral. All of the sadness and
emptiness of the two deaths and
funerals had made her very tired,
nearly to the point of exhaustion.
The young woman managed to stay
awake for most of the drive on her
retum to Bucknell after the funeral,
but on route 15, just in front of the
hospital, the young woman fell
asleep at the wheel and was killed
in a car accident. It is said that her
ghost in a raincoat haunts the third
floor of Hunt in what is now the
Beta Gamma suite. She appears
every two or three years, according
to the article in Bucknell World,
and she asks for help.

Does anyone still believe in

this ghost? Apparently quite a few
people do. The custodians of Hunt
Hall, who wish to remain anony-
mous, claim to have experienced
some strange things on the third
floor. During the summer, when the
custodians thoroughly clean Hunt
hall, they are the only people that
have access to the building. One
custodian swears that on occasional
summer mornings as she enters
Hunt, she can see the bathroom
light on in the third floor. When she
goes to the third floor to clean, the
light is off. This is a recurring
event. Another custodian says that
she can sometimes feel the pres-
ence of someone there and can
almost smell a soft perfume. When
this has happened, she has been
alone. Throughout the many years
that the custodians have cared for
Hunt, they have heard stories from
the residents of the third floor. The
sorority sisters have claimed every-
thing from moved furniture to actu-
ally seeing the ghost.

The Kappa Delta sister who
was a friend to this unfortunate
young woman writes in her letter,
“To all of you who wonder, greet
her with love and calm her fears.
She always found friends on third
Hunt.” This is where the ghost
story ends. Or begins, if you choose
to believe in the ghost of Hunt Hall.

There are some Jan Plans that I
would be interested in tak-
ing...what do you think?

Torn

Dear Torn,

I happen to think that January
is the perfect (and possibly ONLY)
ume to experience college without
stress. Taking a Jan Plan that inter-
ests you leaves plenty of time to do
things you don’t have time for dur-
ing the semester. You can actually
read a book of your own choosing,
leam poker, play in the snow, or
party every night. Or not. There are
fewer people on campus; enor-
mous, crowded parties will proba-
bly be rare. The rule tends to be
more casual get-togethers. You
may want to try to convince some
friends to stay also; they could be
completely different people in the
absence of stress. If you need to
earn money for next semester, there
would be ample time to work. Do
you think you'll get antsy being on
campus when it is uncrowded? Jan-
uary is the perfect time for road-
tripping. Check out Reptiland or
Hershey Park. Follow the basket-
ball team to all of their away
games. Your schedule should be
much more flexible and relaxed
than during the regular school year,
Think of it this way - how much
fun do you really imagine you'll
have at home? Bucknell without

classes and pressure is a different
experience to say the least.

Dear Wanda,

I'm a junior and I’m get-
ting bored with the drinking
scene, I feel like all there is to do
here is to get drunk. Any
suggestions?

Teetotler

Dear Teetotler,

Bucknell advertises many
non-drinking activities. Almost
weekend the Weis Center
hosts a variety of entertainment
operas, Symphonies, and chorale
groups are just a few. Many dance
shows and plays are performed at
Bucknell also, The new Bison is a
great Opportunity to escape the
booze scene. Comedians, musi-
cians, and movies are among the
upcoming activities planned. There
is also nothing wrong with inviting
a group of friends over to listen to
your favorite tunes and chat with
each other. If you have some
money and transportation, you can
go dancing, miniature golfing,
bowling, mall-hopping, or road-
(ripping to visit friends at other col-
leges. Sometimes getting away
from the Bucknell Bubble will
help. The choice to drink is yours
alone - it is up to you to seck out
other ways to spend your time that
will make you happy. Good luck!

Looking for an adventurous dining experience? Ever heard of
Paxinos? Try Ghezzi’s Restaurant and Lounge. Located on Route 61
in Paxinos, Ghezzi’s offers an excellent dining atmosphere, great
food and personalized service.

Julie and Steve, in search of the dining shangri la, took the
plunge and drove the scenic twenty-minutes to Ghezzi’s. Situated
amid a tall stand of pine, the restaurant looks somewhat unimpressive
from the outside — gravel parking lot, modest painted sign and sim-
ple building. (No glaring beacon, like we found at Perkin’s; then
again, Ghezzi’s is no franchise.)

Upon entering, the restauranteur recognizes Ghezzi’s for what
it is reputed to be — a cozy restaurant offering a surprisingly wide
selection of dishes, all at relatively reasonable prices.

Julie sampled the Chicken Cacciatore ($10.95), which she
found to be juicy and moist. Each entree, incidentally, comes with a
salad and serving of Ghezzi’s famous garlic bread — both of which
Julie found to be quite tasty.

Steve tried the Shrimp Katic ($14.50). The shrimp, served in a
cream sauce on a bed of linguine, was plentiful and delicious. Steve
munched quite heavily on the garlic bread, finding it very good, and
enjoyed his salad as well.

One final tipster on Ghezzi’s — don’t bother taking your
American Express, Visa or Master Card. None are accepted. You can
pay with cash, check or be billed.

Julie and Steve highly recommend Ghezzi’s, and have awarded
it the coveted four and one-half bison. Make sure to get reservations,
then check it out!

The Bucknellian

A look at Bucknell’s
underground world

By Sean Grass
Staff Writer

The old wooden door on
Lower Level One of Ellen Clarke
Bertrand Library slid open noise-
lessly to reveal the shadowed room
beyond. The room was walled by
smooth concrete that was inter-
Tupted only by the network of
Pipes and gratings that ran across
the floor. On the opposite wall
stood a chain-link gate that barred
the way to a small and lightless
tunnel. Our guide, Michael Noll,
the Manager of Energy and Utili-
ties at Bucknell, brandished his
flashlight at the dark passage and
called to the photographer Colin
Bridgewater and me to follow him
to the gate.

No, this is not a new edition
of Bison Tales. This is a true story
about Bucknell University and the
secrets that lie beneath it.

I took a deep breath as Colin
checked his camera for the last
time before we entered the mysteri-
ous labyrinth. I reviewed what Mr.
Noll had already told me about the
tunnels.

In a brief discussion in his
office at the Physical Plant, Mr.
Noll offered a bit of background
information. The original tunnel
was constructed from Bertrand
Library in 1950 and ended just ten
yards short of the Carnegie Build-
ing. In 1971, however, a new por-
tion of the tunnel connected this
Previous dead end to the Langone
Center. Even more recently, con-
struction was completed on an
addition to the tunnel that con-
nected Bertrand with the Weis
Center. The original tunnel is
much narrower and more difficult
to navigate than the later additions.

Noll explained that the pur-
pose behind this tunnel system is
the housing of the trunklines of
Bucknell’s heating and electrical
systems. Said Noll, “We’re run
ning steam, we’re running volt-
age—12,000 or 2400 volts, as the
case may be—and phone wiring.”
Having the major arteries for these
systems housed in the tunnels
reduces the rate of deterioration for
the pipes and wires as opposed to
what that rate would be if the pipes
and wires were merely buried in
the ground. Smaller branchings of
Pipes do, however, diverge from
these main arteries and run under
ground to their final destinations.

Colin finished the adjust
ments to his camera, and it was
finally time to enter the mysterious
Bucknell tunnels. Noll unlocked
the chain-link gate and led us for-
ward into the darkness. After a few
steps he stopped and began feeling
along the wall. He found the
switch he was looking for and the
lights came on, one light bulb after
another along the ceiling of the

tunnel,

Lights and telephones, Noll
explained, are spaced along the
entire length of the tunnels. Also
spaced at intervals are the detectors
that are the underground security
system. This security system was
put into place a few years back to
put a stop to a string of thefts in the
Langone Center. Students were
breaking into the tunnels at the
library and finding their way down
to the L. C. where they would steal
food from the dining service, Noll
explained

“Many a student, “ Noll said,
“has broken in and run back and
forth in the tunnels.” Noll jokingly
referred to this as “tunnel mad-
ness”, but on the serious side he

As we began once again
down the original tunnel toward the
Carnegie Building, I saw Mr.
Noll’s point. The tunnel stands
scarcely six and one-half feet tall,
and only four or five feet wide. The
sides and ceiling are lined with a
variety of pipes, valves and clamps,
many of which must be ducked
under or inched around. In the dark
I easily would have cracked my
skull on a low-hanging pipe. As we

ture in the tunnels yet

I thought we’d finally found
some mystery when Mr. Noll
abruptly halted our passage to the
Weis Center. He pointed to a metal
ladder that extended up through the
ceiling of the tunnel and ended at a
metal trapdoor.

“Go ahead and _ open
it...really scare someone, “ he said
Colin climbed the ladder and
pecked his head out of the trapdoor
to find that he was in the parking
lot outside of Swartz Hall. While
he didn’t scare anyone, Colin did
admit to receiving an odd look
from a woman walking at the other
end of the lot. It wasn’t quite the

action I had been looking for.

In fact, though the tunnels
were fascinating in their technical
and engineering merit, they held lit-
tle in the way of intrigue. The
newer tunnels were even cleaner
and more orderly than the original,
and I never did see the rats that Mr
Noll spoke of. Other than the fact
that the tunnels were rather warm
from the heat of the huge steam
pipes, I found them to be quite
comfortable and not at al
mysterious.

Mr. Noll led Colin and me
back to Bertrand Library, conclud-
ing our tour of Bucknell’s under-
ground secrets. As we once again
entered Lower Level One and Mr
Noll proceeded to lock up behind

What's this about the draft...?
Bucknellians will hit the sand

The United States and Republic of Iraq are on the brink of war, it’s high time students here at Bucknell

realize how much our small college community could be affected by it.

With the passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution permitting the use of force to dislodge
Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the United States is poised to launch an offensive strike — one that could cost up to
30,000 casualties in the first week, thus necessitating the reinstatement of a nation-wide draft. Such a move could
mean that your fellow Bucknellians, men 18 years of age and older, would be standing amid the dunes of Saudi

Arabia, draped in chemical warfare gear, in a matter of months.

Hearings held by the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday indicate that this scenario is becoming
increasingly probable — many officials in the Defense Department believe adamantly that a reinstatement of the
draft is necessary. The numbers of troops necessary for real military action, with real casualties, far exceed the
numbers presently in our all-volunteer military. The Defense Department higher-ups believe this draft is neces-
sary now, and with predictions that the war would continue into this summer, draftees would most likely see the
harsh, sandy beaches of the Middle East. This reality is even more piercing when one accepts that the bulk of the
forces in the Gulf will be American forces. That will make the draft — and Bucknellians’ chances of meeting

some Iraqis — even more real

S.T.O.P. (Students and Teachers Organizing for Peace) and various academic departments have been

attempting to inform the community of the implications of the conflict in the Gulf, with only marginal success. It

seems once again that the “Bucknell Bubble” is distorting our abilities to understand and accept the reality of

events that have not yet begun to directly affect us. While you need not agree with these groups’ stances or their

methods of informing, you should arm yourselves with the knowledge necessary to make your o'vn, informed

decisions

Make yourselves aware of the issues and what is at stake, for you may be the next to hit the sands of Saudi

Arabia.

To The Editor:

As I write this, | am one
month and 4,000 miles away from
the “Halloween riot.” Thank God
I can’t tell you how proud I was to
be a Bucknellian as I read the
accounts of October 31, 1990. My
chest swelled with pride as I ima-
gined the scene—Scott Macfee in
a police car surrounded by 500
drunken kids singing “Give Peace
a Chance!” (Somewhere John
Lennon is rolling over in his
grave. I’m sure he wrote the song
for just such occasions—better a
bunch of spoiled-rotten drunken
kids protesting for beer than Vict-
nam war protesters taking up the
tune.) As I read the articles, I kept
hoping I’d get to the end and read
the whole thing was a silly “War
of the Worlds”-type Halloween
prank, and that everyone on cam-
pus was still sane. Yet, that never
happened. It was all horribly real.

I don’t know how anyone
there could have complained that
his or her constitutional rights
were being infringed upon! Last
time I checked, it was not at all

criticizes riot

illegal for police officers to investi-
gate a situation where there was
probable cause that the laws of the
state were being broken. Maybe
400 kids in a couple of houses
playing loud music is not probable
cause, but I would tend to disagree.
Evidently disturbing the peace to
the extent that the police were
forced to respond to neighbors’
complaints is no longer illegal
either. The tensions on campus, no
matter how we students try to fool
ourselves into thinking they rise
from a noble cause, rise from the
fact that most of our students can
think of nothing better to do with
themselves in 48 hours where noth-
ing is planned for them than ille-
gally drinking alcohol. If we can
think of nothing better to do than
break the laws of the state know-
ingly, we deserve strict enforce-
ment by those in positions of
authority.

Perhaps the funniest mental
picture was of the administration
telling 100 drunken students,
things will get better, they need

Reporting of drunken behavior questioned
Protection of identity is necessary in Bucknell’s small community

To the Editor:

In reading The Bucknellian
for the past three years, I can say
that, for the most part, the writers
and editors have been responsible
journalists and have covered fairly
interesting topics despite our some-
what static environment here at
Bucknell. I am sure at times it is
quite challenging to find eye-
catching front page stories week
after week when the most contro-
versial issue on campus is sidewalk
chalk writing. I must say, however,
that in your recent publication you
blatantly crossed the line of respon-
sible journalism in your coverage
of the Curran McCann incident.

We are students in a small
community of about 3,500 people
who know each other and interact
with one another on a daily basis,
and many of us come to a small lib-
eral arts school because of that
tight feeling of community. The
drawback in this, of course, is the
lack of privacy and anonymity that
we all value at times but for the
most part deal without on this cam-
pus. When someone disturbs our
static lives, we have, what your
publication would consider, front
page news.

Librarian expresses concern

Many students and the library staff share concern
about excessive noise in the library. For most people a

Last week’s incident may be
news, but without question other
stories that were covered in the
same issue warranted more atten-
tion than a drunk student who lost
control in the freshman dorms. He
got drunk and violent and now he
will be punished. Surely his deal-
ings with the situation have been a
challenge, and the consequences of
this incident will lead to some frus-
trating and trying times ahead. He
may, in fact, be upset or embar-
rassed about what happened, or per-
haps this incident has brought on
other problems that you or I have
no hint of.

But, of course, you may not

have considered the complexities
of the situation—that he is one of a
couple thousand students on this
campus—and now everyone, pro-
fessors, friends, and administrators
alike, know that Curran McCann
called a security officer a f—ing
pig. How necessary is every abbre-
viated vulgarity? I cannot help ‘ut
think that your readers would have
been able to visualize the scene
had you not spelled out every vio-
lent act that he may have
committed.

This incident could have
been summarized in one paragraph
in the security log. But instead you
resorted to some perverse style of

yellow journalism that made your
front page look foolish. Perhaps
you might keep in mind from now
on that each of us here represents a
fairly significant percentage of this
college community, and what
might be interesting news to tab-
loid papers might be a sensitive
topic to an individual on a campus
of 3,500 students. If this means
another front page headline that
reads Chalk Talk Controversy
Continues, then that is what we
shall read—but at least your publi-
cation will have some, tact.

Professor offers ranking analysis

To the Editor:

I am using the data from the
U.S. News & World Report, Octo-
ber 15, 1990, as an example of mul-
tiple regression analysis for a
course in statistics. Below are some
findings that may be of interest. It
is an analysis of the 133 National
Liberal-Arts Colleges for whom
complete, comparable data is
included in the report so that ranks
could be generated. (For the statis-
tics aficionado, R2 = .88 for the
“Overall Scores” of the top 25 col-
leges.) Colleges were stratified by
programs in which there are at least
2 majors according to the Compara-
tive Guide to American Colleges
(1987).

+ Accounting: Bucknell ranks
#2,

¢ Business Administration and
Management/General:
Bucknell ranks #3.

* Computer Science: Bucknell
ranks #5.

¢ Elementary Education:
Bucknell ranks #1.

« Engineering: Bucknell ranks
#2.

Of the colleges that offer all
five programs, Bucknell is #1 in
the nation by far.

This is a rather immodest
analysis in a numbers game which
may be played in a number of
ways. But when our community is

continually confronting local varia-
tions on universal problems, it may
be helpful to remind ourselves of
what Bucknell is.

Faculty welcome
in Terrace Room

To the Editor:

What a nice and pleasant
surprise it is to glance up from my
plate of salad to see a professor
walk into the Terrace Room. In
the recent wave of stereotypes,
misperceptions, and animosity
between faculty, administration,
and students, I wholeheartedly
welcome this unique professor
into such a prime student hang-
out.

Perhaps more students and
faculty could take steps to social-
ize and understand each other bet-
ter. Why is it that an invisible
wall goes up every day at noon
between the Terrace Room and
the Refectory (the adjacent
faculty lunching area)?

Campus speaks on US role in Middle East

US presence vital
in Persian Gulf

By Tom Travis

There are growing signs that
war may soon occur in the Persian
Gulf, as early as late January or
February. As the prospect for war
nears, the debate over the desira-
bility of military action has inten-
sified in the United States. The
issues are highly complex and
there is no easy answer to what the
United States should do. This
essay will argue that nonviolent
means to dislodge Iraq from
Kuwait should be given many
more months to work, but that if
they should fail, then a U.N. spon-
sored war with a prominent U.S
role should be waged to reverse
Iraq’s aggression.

The argument rests on a cen-
tral premise: Interstate war should
be waged only if it is just. The
realist tradition in international
relations states that in the anar-
chic, competitive world system,
countries must be concerned with
their national interest and practice
self-help by accumulating power
and, when necessary, by waging
war regardless of morality. This
position is wrong. States must not
be permitted to wage war by
whim, often based on_ inflated,
self-serving definitions of national
interest. State behavior, instead,
should be bound by moral
restraints. A key moral principle,
should be the sanctity of life. Only
the most extreme circumstances
should justify the use of violence
to take a human life.

What are the conditions that
would morally justify the killing
of humans through warfare? The
main condition is that of self-
defense. If a person’s life is imme-
diately threatened by an aggressor
and the victim is unable to escape
or peacefully deflect the blow,
then he or she should have the
moral right to practice  self-
defense, including slaying the per-
petrator, if necessary. By acting to
murder the victim, the aggressor
loses his or her right to live and
can justifiably be killed. By anal-
ogy, a state that is victimized by
unprovoked aggression should
have the right to practice violent
self-defense, including taking the
lives of the armed personnel that
have invaded it.

This view on justifiable self-
defense assumes the inviolability
of state sovereignty. State sove-
reignty, the right of a government
to rule its citizens within interna-
tionally recognized boundaries
free from external interference,
has long been enshrined in interna-
tional law. A country may choose
to eliminate its sovereignty volun-
tarily, such as by unification with
another state, but sovereignty
should never be involuntarily
removed by war.

With great caution, the
notion of self-defense could be
stretched beyond resisting a direct
invasion. A government should
have the right to defend itself
against unprovoked, unilateral,
external sanctions that jeopardize

time. All of sudden President Sojka
is President Gorbachev trying to
hold his society together before it
destroys itself. Somehow the rheto-
ric seems so ridiculous—has the
entire Bucknell community lost
sight of what’s really important in
this world? Perhaps the only posi-
tive thing to come of the whole
shameful episode was that “chalk
writing” faded from the front pages
for a while.

It’s funny to look at my

the basic economic or physical
health of its citizens, For example,
if one state should deprive another
of an essential resource or should
initiate a strangling blockade, and
the victim has no peaceful
recourse, then it should have the
right to use military force to pro-
tect its core interests.

Often, the victims of aggres-
sion lack the capability to defend
themselves. These victims deserve
to be defended and to have their
sovereignty preserved. Indeed,
governments and their citizens
should think of themselves as part
of an interconnected human com-
munity and world society where
members not only have a moral
obligation to forgo aggression, but
also to collaborate militarily to aid
victims of aggression who are
unable to help themselves.

In sum, the only morally
permissable use of war is for self-
defense against unprovoked inva-
sion or crippling unilateral coer-
cion and to defend the victims of
such actions. All other forms of
interstate war—aggressive, pre-
emptive, imperial, and interven-
uionist are wrong. On_ these
grounds, most of the wars fought
since 1945, including nearly every
war fought by the United States
and Soviet Union, have been
morally wrong. With one excep-
tion, the superpowers have waged
interventionist wars designed to
sustain or change a particular gov-
ernment. While interventionist
wars are unnacceptable, they are
not as bad as wars of imperial
aggression which snuff out a
country’s very sovereign
existence.

It was clearly wrong of Iraq
to invade Kuwait. Kuwait might
have antagonized Iraq by refusing
to cede islands in the Persian Gulf
to Baghdad, by stealing oil from
the Rumaila oilfield, by cheating
on OPEC price policies, and by
insisting on Iraqi repayment of
loans provided to help Baghdad
fight Iran. Yet, none of these
actions threatened any vital Iraqi
interests or were provocative
enough to justify Baghdad’s
attack. Iraq should not be allowed
to get away with its flagrant viola-
tion of international law and
Kuwait deserves to have its sove-
reignty restored. It should be
noted that Iraq has no right to use
force to end the U.N. embargo,
which admittedly harms its vital
interests. The reason is that Iraq
provoked the embargo which was
introduced only to compel Bagh-
dad to respect international law.

The United States, along
with other members of the global
community, has an obligation to
make Iraq withdraw from Kuwait,
using force to accomplish this if
necessary. The U.S. right to use
force, however, should not rest on
considerations of narrow national
interest. Iraq has done nothing in
the Persian Gulf to threaten vital
American interests. Iraq has not

school from so far away. My
friends at other schools, despite my
protests, always insisted on telling
me that Bucknellians were spoiled
rich kids who could afford to spend
four years totally wrapped up in
themselves, nothing more than
alcoholics in training. I told them it
wasn’t so. Now this. For the first
time in my college career, I was
embarrassed to be a Bucknellian.

Student encourages support of troops

To the Editor:

lam writing in response to
S.T.O.P.’s recent activities and
‘letter of protest’ in the last
Bucknellian. When | first heard
of Students and Teachers Orga-
nized for Peace, I was anxious to
get involved. I do, after all, want
peace. Who doesn’t? I was asked
to wear a yellow ribbon to sup-
port our troops involved in Oper-
ation Desert Shield. I gladly did.
In fact, I have had a big yellow
ribbon in my window for most
of the semester to show my
support.

Then on November 15, I
attended my first, and last,
S.T.O.P. meeting. It was then
that I discovered I was not sup-
porting the troops by wearing
the ycllow ribbon, rather voicing
“disagreement with U.S. policy
in the Gulf.”

This was a distortion of
the traditional use of the yellow
ribbon and I was irate at the way
S.T.O.P. was mixing its words
and intentions. When I voiced
my thoughts at the meeting, I
said I was very concerned with a
peaceful resolution to the situa-
tion in the Gulf, but did not nec-

essarily feel that the troops
should be brought home now, as
they suggested. I was told that if I
don't agree that the troops should
be pulled out now, then “S.T.O.P.
isn’t the organization for me and
perhaps I should start my own
group.”

My grievances with
S.T.O.P. were only beginning.
Perhaps you saw the fifty-four
mock graves before Thanksgiv-
ing? Well, not only did I find it
distasteful, but it was inaccurate.
Ms. Pryor asked in her letter,
“Did you know that fifty-four
people really died?’ Where does
S.T.O.P. get their facts? I picked
up the phone today and called the
Department of Defense to get an
accurate count. The number of
the U.S. casualties thus far in the
Gulf is 49. (Which, incidentally,
is also the number reported by
the press.)

Granted it is terrible that
these people have died; it is not
safe to assume (as Ms. Pryor did
in her letter) that these soldiers
would still be alive if they were
in the United States. As unfortu-
nate as it is, casualuies happen in
military training in the United
States. I realize that every day my

brother gets into his Air Force
plane, he could have an accident. I
also realize that my sisters, parents,
friends, etc., could be in an acci-
dent at any time. These are not kill-
ings due to location, as S.T.O.P.
would have you believe, but acci-
dents that could occur anywhere, to
anyone. Maybe military personnel
are more at risk because of their
jobs, but they do have to do the job
they were sworn to do—support the
policies of the United States
Government.

S.T.O.P. urged us all to edu-
cate ourselves about the conflict,
and yet they are so concerned with
being heard and getting attention,
that they have missed some major
points. First of all, we are not
“going to war for oil.’ Saddam
Hussein is threatening to control
and manipulate world economy.
Secondly, we can not send the mes-
sage to any would-be invaders of
other countries that aggression pays
in these Post Cold War times. And
finally, let us not forget the Ameri-
cans who are being held as hos-
tages. Hussein is inhumanely using
them as shields and they have the
right to be protected by the U.S.

I urge S.T.O.P. to not be so
adamant in believing that pulling

our troops out of the Gulf and rely-
ing only on negotiations with Iraq
is the answer. How does onc nego-
tiate with a liar? I simply ask that
the group, whose name implies that
all who strive for peace are wel-
come, realize that not all who
desire peace agrce on the means of
achieving it.

One final grievance with
S.T.O.P. is that I noticed they have
had a letter writing drive to mem-
bers of the U.N., Congress, and the
White House, but neglected to
write to the troops. I agree with Ms.
Oltorik’s letter and her statement
that the soldiers need to know we
are behind them. My brother was
the first U.S. Air Force officer in
Saudi Arabia. He writes home often
and encourages everyone to write
to the soldiers involved in Opera-
tion Desert Shicld. He says mail is
a great morale booster, and even
though they are all bored and
lonely and anxious to come home,
they are in the Gulf to do a job and
don’t want to leave until it’s done.

Junior disagrees with S.T.O.P.’s ideas

To the Editor:

Walking downhill toward the
UC (Pardon me, the ELC), I could
not help but notice the creative,
overly dramatic display erected by
the members of S.T.O.P. Yes, there
they were, fifty-four little black
tombstones, one for each lost
American life, arranged in front of
a banner upon which was embla-
zoned an oil canister, spilling its
bloody contents which, I assume,
was intended to inspire anger and
heart-felt emotion among the Buck-
nell population. As I gazed upon
this little cemetery, so painstak-
ingly created for our benefit, I
could not help but chuckle to
myself.

Now I do not question
S.T.O.P.’s sincerity, nor do I doubt
their dedication to their cause. For
example, letters such as Sarah
Pryor’s, ones wrought with great
passion and emotion, do indicate
honest (although quite misguided)
feelings. We are asked, “Did you
think it was a joke,” “Did you feel
horror,” “Do you know how many
United States’ troops are in the Per-
sian Gulf now,” “Are you prepared
to lose your own life?” I answered
these questions to myself, and after
reading the statements made by
Sarah Pryor and Mark Larson, I
have my own question to ask: “Do
you have any idea what the hell
you're talking about?”

Normally I am one to keep
my opinions to myself. However,
on this subject I cannot remain
silent. For those of you who were
swayed by S.T.O.P.’s melodra-
matic babblings in the last edition
of The Bucknellian, here are some
things to think about:

First, as Ms. Pryor so elo-
quently pointed out, the fifty-four
deaths that have occurred were due
to accidents. Contrary to popular
belief, accidents do not just happen
when the United States builds up its
military forces in another country.
It is a fact that many American sol-
diers lose their lives due to acci-
dents that occur during basic train-
ing and routine military exercises.
In fact, this occurs weekly, and
mostly on American soil. Why
don’t we hear about this more often
you may ask? Simple, because it
doesn’t make good journalism. A
soldier who is killed in a jeep acci-
dent in Norman, Oklahoma will not
make the front page of any newspa-
per in America. However, transfer
that same incident to the Persian
Gulf, and you have a tragic, sense-

less death. I don’t like to hear of
anyone being hurt or killed, but
you have to realize that unfortu-
nate accidents do happen, and
they can happen anywhere.
Second, we are there for a

legitimate reason. I will be the
first to admit that the world
depends too heavily upon oil for
survival. I sincerely hope that
one day in the near future we can
find new sources of energy, ones
that will save both our environ-
ment, and our lives. However,
reality tells us that oil is the
world’s life blood. Whether you
like it or not, oil is a vital sub-
stance which affects every aspect
of society; politically, economi
cally, and socially. Some people
actually say, “Who needs oil? I
could do without it.” Could you
really? Could you do without
your Car, your major appliances,
your heating system, your air-
conditioning? It takes oil to
either run these items or to pro-
duce them. Now granted, the
world would not come to a
screeching halt if Hussein cut off
the world’s oil supply (which he
has proposed to do), but we
would most definitely fee! the
detrimental effects of such an
action. The world depends upon
oil for survival, and we have
every right to defend this
resource.

Third, sanctions do not and
will not work. Although Arab
culture is rich in tradition, cul-
ture, and religious fortitude, it is
also tribal, fanatical, and antago-
nistic. It would be swell if U.S.
officials could sit down with
Hussein, point out the error of
his ways, and have him say,
“Golly, I guess I was wrong.”
Unfortunately, this could never
happen. Arabs are extremely ter-
ritorial, and if an area of land is
claimed in the name of God or
some other holy conquest, the
victors will defend that land to
the death. Saddam Hussein has
deeply entrenched his forces in
Kuwait, and shows little sign of
relenting. We were asked by
Saudi Arabia to defend their
nation from an attack that could
have in all likelihood occurred.
What was it that deterred them?
It was not words, and nor was it
economic sanctions either. It was
a show of force, a language that
a barbarian like Hussein under-
stands. A man who invades and
destroys a peaceful country, not
to mention tortures and kills his

own people, is not going to give
into sanctions and verbal rebukes.
I’m sorry, but it just won’t happen.
(Regarding the effect of sanctions,
we may look to South Africa as an
example of their failure. The
United States and other nations
around the world have been
imposing economic sanctions
against that nation for years. Some
might say that Nelson Mandela’s
release was a direct result of those
actions. However, what major
changes have there been? The
answer...none.)

I would like to leave you
with this final note. A very close
and dear friend of mine is cur-
rently stationed in the Persian
Gulf. I received a letter from him
not more than two weeks ago. I
would like to quote a few lines
from his letter:

“It scares the hell out of me
sometimes being here. There are
some times when I wish I were
home with you guys, just hanging

out and having fun. But I know that
I’m here for a reason. This isn’t
another Vietnam like I’ve heard
some people say. It’s not just our
asses here, it’s the whole world’s
too. People are depending on us to
make sure Hussein doesn’t pull any
more s—t over here and that makes
me feel pretty good. In a weird way
I'm kind of glad I'm here. I hope
we all get to come home soon, but
I'll stay as long as I have to. Hope
you guys are pulling for me and the
other guys over here. We need to
be here...”

I hope that all of our troops
do come home soon, but in the
meantime, Ict us give them the sup-
port that they need. My friend has
faced reality, and it is about time
that some others did as well.

Sincerely,

S.T.O.P questions support
of Bush’s U.N. resolution

To the Editor:

This Thursday, November
29, 1990, the United Nations
Security Council will vote on a
resolution that allows the use of
military force in the Persian Gulf.
It seems pretty likely that the
Security Council will vote in
favor of this resolution, but I won-
der if anyone will question why
so many countries had suddenly
changed their mind. For example,
Colombia has, in the past, very
firmly stated that they would not
support any use of force and yes-
terday in the New York Times,
they were listed as supporting the
resolution. Over the week of
Thanksgiving, Bush made a
whirlwind trip to countries on the
Security Council. I think students
need to question what happened
behind closed doors, what kind of
coercion Bush used. Do not allow
the American government to con-
vince you that this is a United
Nations agreement. It is President
Bush’s resolution, achieved
through coercion and forceful
persuasion.

Another point to consider is
if the resolution is passed, it will
not be a United Nations force in
the Gulf; it will be an American

force in the Gulf. We will Carry the
burden of this war. It has been esti-
mated that 30,000 Americans will
die. Your best friend may die in
this war. We are the generation that
will make the sacrifices that Bush
is calling for. Are you prepared for
that? Do you want to see the people
closest to you die for a cause that
our government can not even agree
on? ‘

This issue of force is an
American one. Other countries in
the world do not want to use force.
They want to allow time for the
sanctions to work. They want to
encourage negouations. Of course,
these things take time, but can’t we
take a little time to save thousands
of lives?

The point of this Ictter is to
make you aware that passing the
resolution in the United Nations
does not suddenly make force right.
No lives should be lost until every
possible means of peaceful, non-
military solutions have been tried.

In peace,
Nicole Markley °92 and

the members of S.T.O.P.

US gov't strives for prese rvation

attacked the U.S. mainland. Baghdad has never threat-
ened to deprive the United States of oil or to drive oil
Prices up to crippling levels. Iraq has not sought to
close the Persian Gulf to international shipping. The
Iraqi dictatorship is unpleasant, but its human rights
violations are no greater than those of some govern
ments Washington has long supported

Any American military response, instead, should
rest on higher principles of world justice and order
This year is a propitious time to launch a new, pro:
gressive world order based on the twin principles of
full respect for sovereignty and for the inadmissability
of war (this new order should also rest on principles of
economic distribu-
live justice and
ecological sustaina
bility, but these
cannot be
addressed here)
The bipolar world,
a major source of past conflict, has collapsed and
promises to be replaced by unprecedented cooperation
between the two superpowers. The Soviet Union has
ended its empire in Eastern Europe, restoring the
autonomy of the Eastern European states, and has
demonstrated its commitment to curbing warfare by
removing its troops from Afghanistan and by convince
ing Vietnam and Cuba to exit from Cambodia and
Angola, respectively. The U.S. invasion of Panama,
frankly, inhibited the progress toward a more peaceful
world. It is important for the United States to reorient
its traditional foreign policy, defining its interests in
ways more compatible with global needs and acting
collectively rather than unilaterally to confront world
problems

In this context, the United States would not be
justified in initiating war against Iraq at Washington’s
discretion and at a time and under terms of its own
choosing. Any resort to war, including defending a
vicim of aggression, must be subject to a set of
restraining conditions. No military action that violates
these conditions can be considered just.

The principle of respect for the sanctity of life
requires that peaceful measures should be exhausted to
convince Iraq to withdraw before force can justifiably
be employed. Two peaceful methods are being pur-
sued in the Persian Gulf conflict: an economic
embargo and diplomatic communications.

An economic embargo takes time to work—
certainly more than a few months. The embargo has
already cut off nearly all of Iraq’s foreign trade and
financial transactions and has caused shortages of
important foodstuffs and of spare parts for its military
machine. Military intelligence officials have predicted
that with each additional month of the embargo, Iraq’s
military strength will decline. The embargo should be
given sufficient time to have effect, at least a year. If
the embargo should finally compell Iraq to withdraw,
thereby avoiding further bloodshed, this would be
morally preferable to war. It might be countered that
the embargo cannot be allowed to last this long,
because the aggression and its dire effects must be
halted quickly. However, Iraq’s actual invasion lasted
only a few days. Iraqi looting of Kuwait and killing of
its citizens has largely ceased. Since it is not impera-
live to end any ongoing atrocities, there is time to con-
tinue the embargo to determine whether it can
succeed.

Diplomacy must also be given a chance. So far,
the various diplomatic initiatives have failed due to the
mutually exclusive demands of Iraq and its rivals. Sad-
dam Hussein has insisted that any withdrawal must be
linked to and come after a multilateral conference
which discusses all the key problems in the Middle
East. His rivals have opposed such a linkage, believing
this would reward Iraq’s aggression. They have
demanded that Iraq first withdraw from Kuwait, after
which some kind of negotiations might be possible. If
these positions should remain firm, a negotiated solu-
tion will be impossible.

The coalition’s stance raises a question of moral
balance. Should sup-
port of the principle
of not rewarding
aggression exceed
the principle of
avoiding the loss of
human lives? Are
tens of thousands of
deaths worth upholding an intangible principle of
honor? The answer should be no. The United States
should be willing to swallow its pride and to alter its
negotiating position, offering Hussein the prospect of
a face-saving withdrawal. At the very least, the coali-
tion could pledge future negotiations on the issues
specified by Iraq in exchange for an immediate Iraqi
pull-out. Perhaps, a deal could arranged whereby Iraq
would withdraw from most of Kuwait on the day the
conference began and from the remainder some
months later. Promising to hold negotiations would
not commit the coalition parties to any particular out-
come. Indeed, the negotiations could be allowed to
fail.

However, the embargo and diplomatic efforts
cannot be allowed to last endlessly. There must be a
time limit, probably no more than a year, by which
these initiatives either must have succeeded or be
declared a failure. It would be naive not to think that
failure is a real possibility.

If these peaceful options should fail, then the
military alternative should be pursued, but only if a set
of further conditions are met. Any military action
should be authorized by the U.N. Security Council and
not be pursued unilaterally by the United States or

A war should be proportionate and
fought with restraint, using only as
much force as necessary to accom-
plish the coalition’s goals

While it would be preferable to move
toward this world order through nonvi-
olent measures, it looks increasingly
like forceful means may have to be
used in the Persian Gulf.

The Bucknellian

anyone else. For the first time since 1950, the United
Nations has an opportunity to play the security role
envisioned by its founders, one that would be condu-
cive to a more peaceful world order. The U.N. Charter
stipulates that individual states should not decide on
their own when to wage war, but that only the Security
Council, representing the world community through a
majority vote, should make this decision. The only
exception is that states under direct attack may militar-
ily defend themselves, with the armed support of their
allies, until the Security Council mobilizes a collective
security force to wage war on their behalf. The bipolar
conflict, resulting in frequent vetoes by the superpow-
ers, prevented the Security Council from acting effec-
tively for nearly forty years. With the end of bipola-
rity, the
Security Coun-
cil can now ful-
fill its original
pr£gomise. It is
important — that
the United
States adjust its foreign policy to support this new
United Nations role

It would be preferable for burden sharing among
the allies to be a bit less unequal. If war in the new
world order is to reflect the general interest, then states
should fulfill the collective obligation to contribute
generously to the allied force. The predominant U.S.
role, however, does reflect military reality. The core
military powers are supposed to assume the major mil-
itary responsibility for world order,
although in a new world system, they would act as the
servants of the United Nations. Military effectiveness
would be enhanced by having one country supply the

maintaining

bulk of the forces and assume the main command.

The United States should not participate in a
Persian Gulf war, however, without a declaration of
war by Congress. The situation is not a crisis, requir-
ing a quick Presidential decision without time for Con-
gressional approval. The Consitution is unmistakably
clear that Congress should declare war before the pres-
ident sends troops into combat. If President Bush
should act without Congressional authorization, then
he would be guilty of violating democratic principles
and the law of the land, which are impeachable
offenses.

If the United Nations and the U.S. Congress
should approve the use of force, war still should not be
initiated prior to the issuance of an ultimatum. It is
possible that Saddam Hussein will be ready to submit,
once he becomes convinced that a war is really immi-
nent. An ultimatum would probe this Possibility by
demonstrating the coalition’s resolve. The U.N. reso-
luuon currently being prepared will include an
ulimatum

If the Iraqi government should reject the ultima
tum, then the decision to use force should rest finally
on whether the benefits will exceed the costs. Compet
ing moral principles must be weighed against one
another here. On the one hand, Kuwaiti sovereignty
should be restored and naked aggression should be
reversed. On the other hand, the sanctity of human life
should be respected and bloodshed should be
minimized

Two thorny problems arise here. One is where to
draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable
costs. Would ten thousand, fifty thousand, or a hun-
dred thousand deaths be too great to accept? Would
the wreckage of the Iraqi economy, causing great
human suffering, or the destruction of the Middle
East’s oil facilities be an excessive price to pay? The
estimation of costs will depend on the accuracy of
intelligence about the consequences of warfare. The
problem is that intelligence predictions may err, as
they sometimes have in the past.

While prediction can be difficult, it has to be
done. Most intelligence estimates suggest that superior
western military technology, especially air and naval
power, will enable a fairly quick victory, probably
within a month. Battleficld casualties would not be
low, amounting to as many as thirty thousand dead
and wounded among the allicd forces and Many more
among the Iraqis.
But, this war
would not become
a quagmire like
Victnam; indeed,
an analogy to
Vietnam is inap-
propriate here.
This would not be a guerrilla war fought in dense jun-
gles where western technology and strategy have
proven ineffective. Instead, this would be a war on
Open spaces, where the coalition’s superior air, naval
and tank power would be potent and where sophisti-
cated westem strategy should prove effective.

If a quick military victory can be achieved, the
casualties should be limited enough to justify the use
of war, because the gains would surpass the costs. The
benefits would be numerous. The Iraqi aggression
would be reversed and Kuwaiti sovereignty restored.
The international law of sovercignty and nonaggres-
sion would be reinforced. Future aggression would be
deterred, as states recognize that such actions could
make them subject to a similar U.N. response.

It must be remembered that Iraq practices a
highly ambitious, revolutionary, jingoistic foreign pol-
icy. Baghdad has already invaded two states, Iran and
Kuwait, in the last eleven years. It is responsible for
more than one million deaths in the war against Iran.
Iraq may well have aggressive designs on Syria,
Saudi-Arabia, several Gulf emirates, and Isracl. Fight-
ing Iraq now may prevent numerous future wars and
the casualties of a war next year would be far lower
than those in future wars waged with ever more

es
=

sophisticated weapons. Indeed, any future war between
Iraq and Isracl could turn nuclear, incincrating the Mid-
dle East. A beneficial side effect of war could be the
destruction of much of Iraq’s military capability which
could diminish Iraq’s ability to fight in forthcoming
years.

A successful conclusion to the war would pro-
mote a more peaceful world order, manifested by
greater respect for the international law of war and a
strengthened United Nations system with a Security
Council capable of deterring war and enforcing interna-
tional law through the threat of collective security. The
new authority of the United Nations in the security area
could strengthen its role in economic and ecological
dimensions, conducive to a more secure and fair world,
The collective war effort would foster improved coop-
eration between the United States and Soviet Union and
between northern and southern states which could help
to avert future warfare. The precedents established
against aggressive war and unilatcral military action
and in favor of Security Council authorization of mili-
tary force could reshape the attitudes of the superpow-
ers and help to curb or eliminate their future unilatcral
resort to force.

A number of economic benefits would accrue.
The restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty and prevention
of future Iraqi conquests would keep the control over
petroleum resources dispersed, which, in turn, should
help to keep oil prices low. Furthermore, Kuwait and
Saudi-Arabia, the two prime targets of Iraqi aggression,
have played the leading role in curtailing the oil price
rise. Low prices may reinforce the consumptive craze,
heighten environmental pollution and obstruct progress
toward renewable energy. Yet, it must be remembered
that high oil prices are devastating to third world coun-
tries and seriously impede their development. Further-
more, as peace returns to the Gulf, the millions of third
world workers who were so quickly impoverished as
they fled the area, can return.

The costs of a war must not be ignored. There
will be a sizeable loss of life. If a war were to be pro-
longed, encompass the whole region, produce severe
bloodshed, and cause grave economic destruction, or, if
it were to become stalemated and prove unable to
restore Kuwaiti
sovereignty, then
the war should not
be fought. It would
be a lesser evil to
permit the aggres-
sion to stand, inas-
much as the invasion and resultant occupation have
caused only a few thousand deaths and the destruction
has been confined to the small area of Kuwait. How-
ever, as argued above, the military costs of the war are
not likely to be very severe.

A military defeat would humilate Iraq, increase
its resentments and make it thirst for future revenge.
The possession of nuclear weapons in the future could
become an Iraqi obsession. Yet, there should be ways
in a post-war period to satisfy some of Iraq’s demands,
to keep it weak enough to prevent future aggression,
and to obstruct its development of nuclear weapons.
Furthermore, it is possible that Saddam Hussein would
fall from power and be replaced by a leader with more
modest and less bellicose aims.

A war could inflame anti-western nationalism in
many Arab states, which could destabilize the region,
lead to the revolutionary overthrow of some conserva-
tive governments, and instigate a rise in terrorism. Most
Arab governments should be able to withstand the
tumult, however, and those that cannot could be

Thanksgiving spent in the sand|

By Marc Haimes

I just finished watching the Macy’s pre-game
Thanksgiving parade and I’m overwhelmed! This
year, instead of just showing 150-foot inflated Gar-
fields, the news crew ran actual Thanksgiving day
footage of America’s finest over in Saudi Ara-
bia...live! The crew was careful to keep the filming
upbeat, as it depicted large groups of soldiers enthu-
Siastically shaking hands, giving each other high
fives, and doing the “Arsenio Hall Pump” cheer.
You know, the one
that involves extend-
ing your arm inthe air +
while circling your
fist and making a \
sound like a consti-
pated German Shep-
herd. Then the came-
ras showed some
cheerful outdoor shots
of the troops playing
football, volleyball,
relaxing in  ham-
mocks, and generally
making life in Saudi
Arabia look just like
summer
camp...except with
combat boots, nerve
gas, and shorter hair.

Then, at the very end

of the heart-warming

coverage, all the troops lined up and ruggedly
shouted “HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!” while

order

allowed to fall. The citizens of some Arab countries
would benefit from more legitimate, responsive
regimes, and it is unlikely that these new governments
could afford to emulate Iraq or Libya in the new world
order that would emerge. Any rise in terrorism is
unlikely to be morc than a passing nuisance

A severe Iraqi defeat could produce a power vac
uum in the northern Middle East that could provoke
conflict, as Syria, Iran or Turkcy vic to fill the void. A
destabilized region might require an expensive, diffi
cult, long- term military presence. Yct, a strengthened
United Nations should be up to the task of molding a
security arrangement to preserve peace in the region

Warfare might cause the temporary destruc
tion of oil facilities and disruption of shipping which
would lift oil prices to record levels. Many experts
however, doubt that Iraq would have the ability to
destroy its neighbors‘ oil facilities or to severcly dis
rupt the flow of oil. The rise in oil prices would be
temporary and aid agencies could mitigate the effect
on the most severely affected countries.

There is always the chance that things could gx
awry and that the costs could be far greater than antici
pated. If a war should be needed, however, the benefits
of fighting it would seem to exceed the human costs
The loss of even a single life would be tragic, indeed
But, our imperfect world creates the unpleasant moral
dilemma, where loss of life May sometimes be neces.
Sary to attain other important principles. If a reluctance
to risk lives should prevent the coalition from fighting
Iraq, then potential aggressors across the world will
take notice of this lack of resolve, and may begin to
plot attacks on neighbors that would cause a far greater
deathtoll than would war against Iraq next year.

If the coalition should decide to wage war, then
there must be one final limiting condition. A war
should be proportionate and fought with restraint
using only as much force as necessary to accomplish
the coalition’s goals. It would be wrong to flatten
Baghdad and to target civilian areas, when less force
would be sufficient to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait

It is hoped that war can be avoided in the Persian
Gulf. Indeed, the nonviolent measures of a sustair
embargo and a more flexible diplomatic appr
should
attempted in an
effort to peac
fully end Iraq
occupation
Kuwait. These
initiauves
should be given more time to work, certainly at least ¢
year. The recent U.S. decision to double its stre ngth ir
the Gulf was inadvisable because it could prematurel
drive the region toward war. However, if the pe:
Options should fail, then a war should be waged «
force Iraq out of Kuwait, providing that thc
adheres to moral guidelines and that the benefits out
weigh the costs. It would be appropriate for the United
States to participate in this war and to play a leading
role, as long as it acts with the approval of U.N
Security Council and the U.S. Congress. The reversal
of Iraq’s aggression, whether by peaceful or force
means, would promote a more just, peaceful worl
order. While it would be preferable to move
this world order through nonviolent measures, it
increasingly like forceful means may have to be used
in the Persian Gulf.

Staff Writer

In the final game of the 1990,
the Bucknell football team added a
fitting exclamation point to_ its
excellent 7-4 season by trouncing
Fordham 44-7. The seventh win, the
most since 1964, was sparked by
the exceptional play of quarterback
Todd Hatajik ‘91 who connected on
14 of 22 passes for 228 yards and
three touchdowns.

Hatajik finished the season as
the second-rated quarterback in the
Patriot League. His 21 touchdown
passes breaks the school record of
19 set by Scott Auchenbach last
year.

The Bison dominated the
game from start to finish. They cap-
italized on their first possession
driving 63 yards on 12 plays, culmi-
nating on a 3-yard completion from
Hatajik to Jeff Pape ‘92. Pape, who
was promoted to the starting job
when Dennis Barnes ‘91 was
injured, ended the season 15th in
the Patriot League in pass receiving.
He caught 26 passes for 342 yards
and five touchdowns. The only
other pass of the drive proved to be
the longest play, a 19-yard comple-
tion to Lester Erb ‘91

On the next Bucknell drive,
the offense extended the lead to 10-
0 after a 33-yard field goal from
Todd Krutchkoff ‘91. The kick was

Women’s hoops drops home
opener to Delaware, 86-76

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The Bucknell women’s bas-
ketball team suffered a tough defeat
last Wednesday, as it lost to the
University of Delaware at home,

86-76. The Lady Blue Hens
mounted a strong second-half rally
to overtake and beat the y
Bison. The loss drops Bucknell to
0-3 for the year, with their initial
two losses coming over Thanksgiv-
ing break to Rice and Bradley in

Rice’s Holiday Classic in Houston,
Texas.

The first five minutes of the
game produced very little scoring
as both Bucknell and Delaware
were unable to get on track shoot-
ing from the outside perimeter. The

Kirsten Ellison ’92 finds the lane clogged with Lady Blue Hen defenders as she attempts to drive to the
hoop. The Lady Bison fell to Delaware 86-76.

Lady Bison then jumped out to a 13-
3 lead, led by Kelly Dee ‘94 who
caught fire from long range banging
down two three-pointers.

Delaware called a
with 13 minutes remaining in the
first half. The stoppage of play ben
efited the Lady Blue Hens, as they
answered Bucknell’s call by rattling
off the next nine points, all from
Bucknell turnovers, to close within
a single point.

The Lady Bison then forced a
full-court press on Delaware, and
the hosts pushed their lead back up
to seven at 23-16 with 5 minutes
remaining. Delaware then brought
in reserve center Rhonda Clifton,
who ate up Bucknell’s defense
inside, cutting the margin
more. Then, with three seconds left
in the half Clifton missed her sec-
ond free throw. The Lady Blue Hens
got the rebound and quickly pushed
the ball to forward Molly Larkin,
who drilled a base line jumper at the
buzzer to cut the Bucknell lead to
four going into the second half.

“T don’t think that (Larkin’s
jumper) was a turning point in the
game,” said Kelly Dee ‘94. “We
were still pretty pumped going into
the locker room with the lead. We
lost a few points off missed
rebounds on free throws, we just
have to learn to box people out bet-
ter because a lot of times we’re
smaller than the team we are
playing.”

Bucknell came out of the
locker room with the idea that they
wanted to get the ball inside to their
front-court players, Julie Bachman
GR and Kirsten Ellison ‘92. How-
ever that backfired on the Lady
Bison, as they were unable to get a
good shot on the Blue Hen defense.
Not to be denied, Bachman took her
game to the outside, where she hit a
three-pointer to push Bucknell to a
43-34 lead.

Once again, Delaware
responded with Clifton, who came
up with many crucial baskets inside
and opened up the game for shoot-
ing guard Linda Cyborski, who was
unstoppable from outside.

Cyborski rammed home three
Straight jumpers from the outside as
Delaware found itself up 48-47 after
an uncontested layup off a fast
break. Despite a Bucknell time out,
Delaware continued to roll as point

set up by a 25-yard catch by Erb.

Bucknell scored again on its
first possession in the second quar-
ter when Hatajik threw eight yards
to Matt Walsh ‘93 for the score
The touchdown concluded a 63-
yard drive that consisted of 11
plays. Walsh set up his score by
carrying the ball 21 yards after
breaking a Ram tackle.

The Bison put the game away
as they scored again on their next
play, a 58-yard reception by Dan
Scc : The catch marked the
longest play from scrimmage this
year. Scocca ended the season 12th
in the conference in receiving with
32 catches for 458 yards. His 128
third best in

career catches are
Bucknell history

Bucknell scored once more
before the half ended as Krutchkoff
nailed a 35-yard field goal with 38
seconds left in the second quarter.
On the drive Hatajik threw a 14-
yard pass to Scocca along with a
35-yard completion to Erb.

Erb’s reception was his 44th
of the year for a total of 735 yards,
good enough for sixth in the confer-
ence. Erb ends his career with 1819
total receiving yards, third best in
Bucknell history. He also leaves
Bucknell with 18 career touchdown
receptions, a record he shares with
former NFL player Tom Mitchell.

At halftime — the
showed how thoroughly Bucknell
had controlled this football game.
The Bison had 289 total yards com-

statics

pared to only 111 for Fordham. Hat-
ajik had completed 11 of 16
attempts for 209 yards. Bucknell’s
defense had also intercepted three
passes and recovered a fumble.
Brian Henescy ‘91 was surprised by
the ease Bucknell had in this game
stating, “I thought we would have a
tougher game. They just weren’t up
for the game and we were really
hungry to go 7-4.”

The dominance the Bison
established in the first half carried
over to the second as Hew Wood-
ward ‘93 intercepted his second
pass of the day. He also led the
Bison with seven total tackle and
was consequently named Patriot
League Rookie of the Week. His
pick-off set up Krutchkoff’s third
field goal of the afternoon, this one
from 29 yards.

The field goal was his tenth
straight for the season, a new Buck-
nell record breaking Al Yunkus’
mark of 7 set in 1983. Krutchkoff
also set the Bucknell record for
most points by a kicker in a season
with 67, topping Steve Barimo’s 53
point season of last year.

Krutchkoff commented on his
records by saying, “They were a
great bonus on top of a great year
for the team. I knew about the
records coming into the game. I
tricd not to think about them when I
was kicking.”

Bucknell was able to score
again before the offense even came

Men’s swimming
drops first two

By Darren Millman
Staff Writer

The men's swimming team
struggled in its first two meets of
the 1990-91 season suffering a pair
of losses to the likes of UMBC
(138-103) and conference opponent
Colgate (145-99).

In the meet against UMBC,
the visiting Bison experienced litile
success, as they captured only four
individual victories. Don Steenson
"92 and diver Eric Carr 93 each
contributed two wins to the Bison
team effort.

Steenson finished first in both
the 200 meter individual medley
(2:00.89) and the 200 meter back-
stroke (1:58.46). Carr dove to vic-
tory in the 1-meter diving event by
compiling a point total of 212.4.

He followed this effort with a win
in the 3-meter event with a total of
215.4 points.

The Bison traveled to Colgate
on November 18 to compete in their
first Patriot League contest of the
season.Bucknell came out strong
and appeared poised to give the Red

Raiders a run for their money. The
tide quickly turned, however, and
Colgate established a lead which it
would not relinquish.

In the meets initial event the
Bison jumped out to the early lead
by winning the 400 meter medley
relay. The winning Bison relay
team consisted of Steenson, Chad
Farrell 92, Scott Dietrich ’93, and
Jay Gross 93. The winning time
was 3:38.82.

Bucknell's advantage was
short-lived as the Red Raiders raced
away with six of the next seven
events. Three Bison swimmers
managed to win individual events.
Gross sped to victory in the 50 free-
Style in a time of :21.89.

Steenson won his third event
of the season as he finsihed first in
the 200 meter backstroke with a
time of 2:00.03. Farrell contributed
a victory to the Bison's cause by
winning the 200 meter breaststroke
(2:20.37).

Bucknell will look to get its
first win of the young season when
the Explorers of LaSalle invade
Rooke pool on December 8.

blocked a Fordham punt. Janne Kil-
pelainen ‘93 recovered the ball and
raced in 22 yards for the touch-
down putting the score at 37-0. The
touchdown marked the third time
this season Bucknell has returned a

block punt for a score.

Bucknell put its last points on
the scoreboard on the first play of
the fourth quarter as Craig Cavlovic
“91 ran the ball 22 yards for the
score. The 79 yards recorded on the

off a three-point-play to make it
62-54 on Juliet McGee’s ‘93 fourth
foul with 7:30 to play.

Bucknell and Delaware then
traded baskets for the next five
minutes, bringing the score to 76-
63 with two minutes remaining,
when Lady Bison guard Joy San-
dler ‘92 came up with the hot hand
from the outside, it brought Buck
nell to within seven points at 80-

dler responded with a three-pointer
to bring them within six, but it was
too little too late, as Bucknell was
unable to capitalize off two missed
Delaware free throws, and wound
up losing 86-76.

“We live and die by the, out-
side shot,” said Sandler. “We
worked on getting the ball inside in
practice but we just weren’t able to
do it today. We lost a little control
on the fast break, but that will come

73. After a Delaware bucket, San-

“I think we played a little
defensive in the second half instead
of coming out and doing the things
we did well in the first half,” said
Dec. “It seemed like we playing not
to lose the Icad, rather than playing
to win, and I think its just.a matter
of coming out more determined and
thinking your going to blow out the
other team.”

Bucknell also lost its games
in the Rice Holiday Classic in
Houston over break. The Lady

Eleven players from the
Bison were elected to the All-
Patriot League team. In addition,
Head Coach Lou Maranzana was
named Patriot League Coach of the
Year. It will be difficult though for
the Bison to be as successful next
year as they were this year. Krutch-
koff noted that “next year’s team
will do really well. Coach will
motivate them as well as or better
than this year.”

Eight of the 11 offensive
starters will graduate at the end of
this year, however, a powerful
backfield consisting of Henesey,
Walsh, and McElvene will return.
Henesey rushed for 78 yards on 18
carries against the Rams to boost
his season total to 815 yards, good
enough for third best in the
conference.

He needs just 23 yards next
season to reach the 2,000 yard
mark for his career. He would
become only the third player in
Bucknell history to accomplish this
feat. He is more concerned about
becoming a complete player next
year rather than breaking records.

He said, “It would be great to
achieve those records, but I’m
thinking about improving my over-
all_ game, blocking and receiving.
The running comes naturally.”
More pressure will be placed on the
backfield as Larry Czeponis ‘92 is
the only starter returning from the
offensive line, while Pape is the
only starting receiver that will
return,

On defense, the Bison are in
better shape as only six starters will
be leaving. Bucknell will lose Bill
Higgins ‘91, the team’s leading
tackler, as well as Trevor Smith
“91, who led the conference this
season with six interceptions.

Bison took on the host team Rice in
the first game and dropped a tough
one 80-66, despite a 20-point scor-
ing effort from Bachman. In the
consolation game Bucknell lost
another battle to Bradley 96-83,
after a 22-point half by Sandler.
Bachman finished the Bradley
game with 21 points and was
named to the All- Tournament
team. Bucknell will look for its first
victory of the year when they take
on Princeton tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.

Bill Courtney ’92

Co-Captain Bill Courtney ‘92 was named Athlete Of The Week
for his outstanding play in the Bison’s first four games this season.
Bucknell’s leading scorer has led the team to a 3-1 record including a
championship victory in the consolation round of the San Juan
Shootout.

The second year starter has sparked the team with a 23 point aver-
age, including a season high 28 in Wednesday nights 81-72 victory Over
the Blue Hens. In addition Courtney is averaging over four assists a
contest.

Courtney was selected to the All-Tournament team in Puerto Rico
as he led the Bison to victories over both Norther Iowa and Saint
Louis. He will hope to continue to contribute in the Bison’s three
upcoming games next week, including tomorrow night’s contest against
Yale at Davis Gym.

Center Pau! Olkowski ’93 reaches for the tip-in along with Delaware's Denard Montgomery. The Brea-

kin’ Bison topped the Blue Hens 81-72 to improve their record to 3-1.

By Tommy Abel
Staff Writer

With a smothering defense
and a barrage of three-point shots
led by Bill Courtney ‘92, who
scored 28 points and dished off five
assists, Bucknell defeated Delaware
81-72, Wednesday night.

With 7:02 remaining in the
game the Bison defense buckled
down as the team went on a five
minute, 15-3 run capped off by a
thunderous Mike Bright ‘93 jam
that brought 1,800 Bison fans to
their feet. The final two minutes of
the game belonged to Courtney,
who tallied the last ten points for
the Breakin’ Bison.

Courtney went 8 for 8 from
the charity stripe in the final minute
and ended the game in style with an
emotional two-handed dunk off a
Bright steal, which put an exclama-
tion point on the victory for the
Bison.

The first half of the contest
was played to a 37-37 draw with
Bright and Courtney leading the
way with 12 and ten points, respec-
tively. Keith Fenton ‘91 also added
six first half points with two three-
point bombs.

The Bison guard rotation of
Courtney, Fenton, and Russell Pey-
ton ‘93 which combined for 45
points, 18 assists, and 7 steals
proved to be too much for the Dela-
ware squad. Courtney finished with
a game high 28 points and five
assists while Fenton added nine
points, all on treys.

Peyton might have played the
most complete game of the three,
contributing eight points, nine
assists, six rebounds, and six steals
in just 24 minutes of play.

Fenton commented on Pey-
ton’s play, “Russ is just playing
really solid. His play is just real
consistent across the board.” Mike
Bright also turned in another excep-
tional performance, scoring 21

Grapplers place fifth andsecond
in season’s opening twotourneys

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

The wrestling team opened
its 1990-91 season at the Blooms-
burg Invitational on November
17th with an impressive second-
place finish. The team also partici
pated in the MAT Town Invite in
Lock Haven on November 24th,
placing fifth in a competitive field
of thirteen teams.

Bucknell’s in the
tournaments Is an encouraging sign
as the wrestlers head into the tough
James Madison Invite this Sunday.
All indications point to a winning
season in which the Bison could
finish among the top twenty teams
in the country.

At the Bloomsburg Invita-
tional, Bucknell accomplished “an
excellent performance” according
to Head Coach Bob Ferraro. The
Bison finished second in a “very
talented” field of teams behind
Bloomsburg, a squad they beat last
year despite only losing two
players from the previous season.

Individually, six Bucknell
grapplers made it to the finals of
the tournament. The Bison crowned
two champions of the invitational,
tri-captains Tom Marchetti ‘91
(167 Ibs.) and Bryan Burns ‘91
(190 Ibs.). The other tri-captain,
John Walizer ‘91, injured his knee
before the season and will be out of
action until January. Currently
Marchetti is ranked 7th in the
nation, Burns is 11th, Chris Doukas
“91 (134 Ibs.) is 18th, and Mike
Van Doren ‘92 (142 Ibs.) is 32nd.

At the MAT Town Invite,
Bucknell had another strong show-
ing, resulting in a fifth-place finish
out of thirteen schools. Bucknell
was the only university competing
at the Invite which does not offer
athletic scholarships.

Success

Penn State, currently ranked
fifth in the country, won the tourna-
ment, followed by Syracuse, Rider
and North Carolina State. One team
that the Bison finished ahead of was
Oregon, currently ranked
teenth in the country. Marchetti
won the tournament in his weight
class, while Burns finished second,
Ken Herceg ‘92 (177 Ibs.) third and

respective divisions.

Bucknell hopes to continue
its success of the past two weeks
when it heads for Virginia and the
JMU Invite this weekend. Blooms-
burg will be participating in the
tournament as well. Ferraro noted,
“This will be a good test to see if
we can come back and beat them

each in their

[Bloomsburg] after losing to them
earlier.”

Also participating in the
tourney will be Duke, Old Domin-
ion, Millersville, American and
Howard. Ferraro’s goal is to have
the Bison finish in the top two in
this tournament, a goal he sees as
“very reasonable.”

points, pulling down a team high
nine boards and dishing off five
assists. Pat King ’92 was also able
to effectively contribute to the
team’s success by playing 38 solid
minutes and tossing in ten points.

Before Wednesday night’s
game, the Breakin’ Bison had just
retumed from a very successful
outing in the San Juan Shootout,
which was held over Thanksgiving
break. Coach Woollum commented
on the tournament by saying, I
think we accomplished everything
we could have dreamed of accom-
plishing. I think that we realized in
order to beat teams we have to play
hard, and we did.”

The Bison went 2-1 in a three
day tournament that featured some
of the top talent in the country: IIli-
nois, Nebraska, Murray State, St.
Louis, Northern Iowa, Old Domin-

ber 30, 1990

ion, and the University of America
in Pucrto Rico. The trip was able to
offer the tcam much more than bas-
ketball experience as Coach Wool-
lum explains, “I think it was an
educationally sound trip because
we got to see another culture so to
speak, with different languages and
a litte different lifestyle. And I
think all that was a total benefit for
Our program and our kids.”

In their first game the Bison
faced a tough Murray St. team, but
were still able to jump out to a ten
point halftime lead. Unfortunately
for the Bison, the Racers’ size and
experience caught up with them in
the second half, as Bucknell
dropped its first game of the season
81-68. Leading the charge for the
Bison were Courtney 18 points,
Fenton 14 points, and Paul Olkow-
ski ‘93 who added 15 points.

Bucknell was able to tum it
around in the second game as they
came from behind in the second
half before defcating Northern
Iowa 71-57. The team was led by
Courtney who scored a team high
25 points. He was later selected to
the All-Tournament Team.

In the third game against a
very talented St. Louis club , the
Bison certainly demonstrated their
flexibility and a well balanced scor-
ing attack that featured four players
in double figures.

The most inspiration play of
the game though might have come
from King who netted 20 points
and swiped 13 boards, eight of
them offensive, and is credited by
Coach Woollum for keeping the
team in the first half. “Pat kept us
in the first half. If Pat doesn’t just
tear up the glass and get fouled and
make his foul shots then we get
way behind and maybe we don’t
catch up.”

The Bison finally prevailed
by eclipsing the century mark, 103-
93. Bright tallied 25 points and five
rebounds while Courtney chipped
in 21 points and four assists, Fen-
ton also contributed 12 points, all on
treys. Peyton sparked the Bison as
well with his consistent play; add-
ing nine points, four rebounds, four
assists, and three steals.

Women’s swimming
strokes past Colgate

By Darren Millman
Staff Writer

Behind the sensational perfor-
mance of Margaret Grunow ’93, the
women's swimming team topped

tance the freshmen talent on the
team explaining, “We only gradu-
ated one swimmer and we have
eight freshmen on the team. They
help provide the depth that helps to
win meets. Granted we have excel-

“I think we have a good chance to win con-
ferences. That would be our ultimate goal
at this point.”

—Margaret Grunow ‘93

i

the Lady Red Raiders of Colgate
132-110 in the season's first meet.

Grunow cruised to three indi-
vidual victories to pace the visiting
Lady Bison's team effort. She took
the 100 meter (:54.43), 200 meter
(1:58.77), and 500 meter (5:20.04)
freestyle events.

She attributed her fast early-
season times to the fact that she
trained over the summer and
entered the season in good condi-
tion, both physically as well as
mentally.

Andrea Falcione 92 swam
away with a victory in the remain-
ing sprint event with a time of
:25.27.

The Lady Bison teamed up to
race away with the 400 freestyle
relay event. Falcione anchored the
team that also featured Kathleen
Hamett 94, Peggy Hovis ’94, and

lent frontline talent, but the others
are contributing the points needed
to win.”

Hamett captured the 200
meter backstroke with a time of
2:15.09.

Others winning individual
events included wi-captain Carla
Banashek °91 in the 200 meter
breaststroke (2:35.16), and Wendy
Sheldon ’93 in the 200 meter indi-
vidual medley (2:19.96).

The team is now preparing
for a December 8 mect at home
against LaSalle. The Lady Bison
certainly have the momentum of a
big win over Colgate working in
their favor as they attempt to
improve their record to 2-0 in this
young season.

“I think we have a good
chance to win conferences,” stated
Grunow. “That would be our ulti-
mate goal at this point.”

BU Crime
rate tops PA

By Steve Hoerter
Staff Writer

Bucknell University has the
highest crime rate per 1,000 stu-
dents in the state of Pennsylvania,
according to a USA Today crime
statistics report published Monday.
That rating, however, is being
called misleading by Vice President
for Administration Barry Maxwell
and recently appointed Director of
Security and Safety, Vince
DeCerchio.

The report lists Bucknell as
having 62 crime incidents per thou-
sand students per year — which
translates into approximately 217
students affected by crime on cam-
pus each year. Included in the
report were 32 other private and
public institutions in Pennsylvania,
including urban schools such as the
University of Pennsylvania, Tem-
ple University and the University
of Pittsburgh. Some schools, how-
ever, refused to participate in the
survery cr were not contacted by
USA Today for statistics.

Maxwell responded to Buck-
nell’s ranking yesterday by saying
that, “‘the statistics shown for Buck-
nell are high because in our classifi-
cation scheme we have included all
acts of vandalism and petty theft.”
He continued, “It appears that the
other instituuons have not
{included such incidents].” Max-
well added, “What’s really impor-
tant are the incidents of serious
crimes” of which Bucknell only
had 5.”

Faculty/administration
upset by trustee budget

Tempers flared as reputations were put on the line

By Travis Elliott
Staff Writer

A dispute has erupted over
the proposed increase in the com-
prehensive fee for the 1991-92
school year, pitting the faculty and
administration against the Board of
Trustees. During the faculty meet-
ing on Monday, Barry Maxwell,
Vice-President for Administration,
characterized the debate over the
increase in the comprehensive fee
during the meeting of the Finance
Committee as “heated and down-
right angry” and said the exchange
contained “unprofessional
rhetoric.”

Professor of management,
John Miller, said, “The discussion
in the early part of the mecting was
fairly straightforward, but then it
took a turn and became heated.”

Following the recommenda-
tion from the Board’s Finance
Committee, the Board of Trustees
voted 28-6 to reject the Budget
Subcommittee’s proposal to
increase the comprehensive fee by
6.7% for the ’91-92 fiscal year. On
Friday, the Finance Committee had
previously decided to reject the
Budget Subcommittce’s recommen-
dation and instead to send the bud-
get back to campus with a recom-
mendation for an increase in the
comprehensive fee which was not
to exceed 4.5%.

S.T.O.P. protest soawns campus debate

By Michael McGandy
Staff Writer

“TJ think what S.T.O.P. is
doing is good to increase aware-
ness, but I am not sure what they
are trying to achieve beyond that,”
Andree Levally ’92 said. “What do
they want us to do beyond being
aware is my question to them.”

Levally’s statement, offered
over some class work she was
doing in the Bison, in many ways
summarizes the campus’ response
to the activist group Students and
Teachers Organized for Peace
(S.T.O.P.). During the past few
weeks §.T.O.P. has engaged in
numerous activities, including a
protest in front of the Lewisburg
Post Office and an open forum on
Wednesday night, to engage stu-
dents in the issues surrounding the
American presence in the Persian
Gulf.

In a not very scientific, but
representative survey of twelve
undergraduate men and women
spending the late-morning hours in
the Bison, seven stated that they
were supportive of S.T.O.P. insofar
as they were attempting to make
this campus more aware of the situ-
ation in the Persian Gulf.

Yet, as Levally said, there are
questions amongst the student body
as to what S.T.O.P. is working
toward and what the goal of their
activism is. Of those students ques-
tioned many expressed concern that
S.T.O.P. might have a political
agenda that went beyond informing
the campus of the status of this
nation’s foreign involvement.

“T found a lot of things they
say to be interesting and that they
raise a lot of important issues,” Rob
Hess ’91 said about S.T.O.P. “Yet I
am not sure exactly what would be
their motives or intent if we went to
war. I would not be supportive of
any activities that resembled the
burning of draft cards.”

Yancy Molnar ’91 went fur-
ther and said that the activities of
S.T.O.P. are divisive. “I really do
not agree with what they say; I
think it only separates people. In
case like this what we want to be is
together and if it comes to war, we
do not.need protests.”

Most of those people who
responded, though, did not express
opposition, but rather uncertainty
about S.T.O.P. In general it
appears that there is a lack of
knowledge about the organization
itself and, as a result, students are
not willing to associate themselves
with the group beyond its role as
an Yet,

in favor of peaceful solutions to the
Persian Gulf crisis every Friday in
front of the Lewisburg Post Office

About last Friday’s demon-
stration Janota said, “I feel that the
demonstration went very well. We
began with a little under twenty
people and at the conclusion there
were about fifty with us.”

there is no choice but to fight Huss-
ein,” Jen Atherton °91 said. “If we
just pull out we are condoning
Hussein’s acts.”

Matt Lowrey ’93 said of the
situation in the Persian Gulf, “I
think it is distressing, but I sull
think we need to have our forces
there. We cannot pull out as things
now stand.”

Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian

Students and area residents protested the conflict in the Persian Gulf in front of the United States Post
Office on Market Street last Friday. S.T.0.P. has planned a similar demonstration for today, from 4 to

5:30 p.m.

S.T.O.P. is working to inform stu-
dents about the dynamics of the
armed standoff on the Kuwati bor-
der they seem to be widely
appreciated.

Over her lunch Jennifer Hay-
taian °91 said that she found the
efforts of S.T.O.P. to be very help-
ful. “I think it is good. I wish I was
more knowledgeable on the sub-
ject,” she explained. “The amount
of time we spend in the classroom
and with our studies keeps us from
engaging the issues.”

Mollie Janota °91 of
S.T.O.P. said that she was pleased
that the organization was progress-
ing and making an impact on the
campus. In addition to campus
based activities, S.T.O.P. has
undertaken to hold a demonstration

“That we were out there and
had a good gathering says a lot; we
have sparked people to take some
kind of action,” Janota stated. “We
will definitely be out there every
week until there is a resolution.”

Yet, while much of the stu-
dent body is cautious and con-
cerned about the prospects of war
and its implications for their lives,
there is also a sense that many do
not see an alternative to using force
to resolve the impasse with Iraq.
Those students questioned in the
Bison were mostly reluctant to
engage this nation in a military con-
flict, but some also believe that the
use of force may be necessary.

“I am not advocating war,
but, if in a couple of months things
continue like they are now, then

If this perspective is as perva-
sive amongst the student body as a
whole as it was in the small sam-
pling of students questioned in the
Bison, it may be hard to reconcile
most students with the position of a
member of S.T.O-P., in a letter to
the editor in the November 16 edi-
tion of The Bucknellian.

“T believe the United States
has absolutely no legitimacy in tak-
ing the role it has assumed in the
Persian Gulf crisis,” Sarah Pryor of
S.T.O.P. wrote. “I believe what our
country has done is wrong and
offensive and I will struggle to stop
the United States’ military actions.”

If this contrast of viewpoints

arguments to the contrary were pre-
sented and though many of us from
the campus community virtually

sionals in the field on the campus
proposal, the Finance Committee
was ultimately swayed by those
who were advocating a comprehen-
sive fee increase of no greater than
4.5%. Though some of us had our
professional sensibilities wounded,
many members of the Board have
gone out of their way to make it
clear that their action was prompted
by the dire predictions for the
health of the economy(sic] rather
than any lack of confidence in the
campus process.”

The dance has two intended
purposes: first, to raise money for

to unite students and faculty in a
campus-wide activity. “Our goal
is to involve every living person
on campus ... This is an all encom-
passing event,” said Joe Krakoff,
co-chair of the Dance-for-a-
Chance committee

Only 75 percent of the
dance’s profits will be donated to
the regional MS office. Organiza-

that cost is not the only factor.”
Langone was unable to be
reached for comment, but Lee Idle-
man ’54, Chairman of the Board of
Trustees, speculated that Langone
was concerned with the state of the
economy and the affordability of a
Bucknell education. Idleman
stressed that increases in the com-
prehensive fee, along with a lack of
financial aid, have placed Bucknell
out of the price range of many mid-
dle class families. Idleman admit-
ted that Bucknell had a lower com-
prehensive fee than most of its
frame of reference schools, but he
said that much of the difference
could be based on lower cost of liv-
ing in the Lewisburg area than for
many metropolitan schools. He also
noted that Bucknell’s tuition,
excluding room and board, is not
unusually low in comparison with
the frame-of-reference schools.
Barry Maxwell said, “As a

Kate Baker ’91: “I would be

but I would not want to think that

Mark Lucke °93: “It seems

Kate Baker ’91: “I feel that

Mark Lucke ’93: “I don’t
really know much about it or
what they have done.”

Anna DiDomenico °93: “I
think what they have been doing
is promoting awareness. They
may provoke rude comments, but
it does get people to think.”

Linda Massa ’92: “I really
support what they have been
doing. It is good to make stu-
dents aware of what is going on
and make them more involved.
The issue is big enough that eve-
rybody knows about it, but
groups like STOP are doing a
good job in getting people
engaged in the issues.”

Robert Semenak ’91: “I
think that it is good if for nothing
else than to create more
awareness.”

Yancy Molnar °91: “I
really do not agree with what
they say. I think it only separates
people internally. In cases like
this what we want to be is
together and if it comes to war,
we do not need protests.”

Andree Levally °92: “I
think what they are doing is good
to increase awareness, but I am
not sure what they are trying to
achieve beyond that. What do
they want us to do beyond being
aware is my question to them.”

Mark Lowrey °93: “I think
essentially if what they are doing
is notifying the campus it is
good, but if they were to tum
toward negative propaganda it is
another thing. The tombstones
were a good way to let the cam-
pus know what has been going
on. Informing the Bucknell cam-
pus is fine, but if they go beyond
that it is simply a matter of them
expressing their opinion.”

Jen Atherton ’91: “I really
do not know much about it. I
think they have done a lot to
make people aware and that is a
good thing. Yet we might have to
bring about war to bring peace to
the region.”

Chris Bowen °91: “All I
really know is that they staged a
protest. I heard the cops were
ready to hassle them if they
stepped out of line. We have a lot
of misguided Americans. STOP
has the right idea and they are
getting a lot of grief. You can
protest war and still be a patriotic
American.”

Jennifer Haytaian °91: “I
think it is good. I wish I was
more knowledgeable on the sub-
ject. The amount of time we
spend in the classroom and with
our studies keeps us from engag-
ing the issue.”

Crime

From page 1

Vince DeCerchio questioned the
reporting methods of the other
schools surveyed. “There are some
serious questions as to the methods
some of those schools used for
classifying and compiling [their]
Statistics,” DeCerchio said. He
continued, “there is no uniform
methodology across the nation for
crime classification or
compilation.”

Maxwell, in a separate inter-
view, said “(this discrepancy in
reporting] illustrates the kinds of
differences that occur between
institutions in counting [crimes on
campus].” Maxwell said, “clearly
we have counted everything, as a
result of that, we look unusually
high.”

DeCerchio also called into
question Bucknell’s own classifica-
tion system which he will be
reviewing in coming weeks.
DeCerchio said “in the past, we
were classifying [accidents] as

‘coupon
lunch

ee et se

vandalism—incidents in which
there was no evidence of criminal
intent.” DeCerchio added that in
order for an incident to be classi-
ficd as a crime, criminal intent
must be apparent.

DeCerchio said that while
Bucknell will not change its policy
of reporting all incidents of crime
on campus, the classification sys-
tem will be reviewed to determine
if there are any discrepancies.
Maxwell said “we will not ‘cook
the books’ to make [the university]
look better.” He did, however,
State “the review of Bucknell’s
classification system is in order.”

Citing lower crime rates on
campus than in communities at
large, DeCerchio said “any campus
is the same as any other commu-
nity in the U.S. Campuses experi-
ence the same ills and problems
that any other community experi-
ence. The members of our [cam-
Pus] community need to take the

same precautions as other commu-
nities [do].”

December 7, 1990

By Brian Hutchinson
Staff Writer

“After six years of study,
trial, and experience in efforts to
control student drinking, the Execu-
tive Committee issued a statement
on September 22 stating that the
use and posses-
sion of alcoholic
beverages, _ nor-
mally banned in
all university
would hereafter be
banned as well in the fraternity
house: “hus began a letter from
the administration to alumni in
November 1954. The announce-
ment of the controversial new pol-
icy was made by the Executive
committee at a meeting with the
fraternity presidents and social
chairmen, as well as a number of
the alumni advisors of the
fraternities.

During the following week,
the fraternities, through the Inter-
fraternity Council, were arduously
discussing and formulating a propo-
sal of compromise on drinking in
fraternity houses to be presented to
the Executive Committee for con-
sideration. Prior to this accomplish-
ment, however, some students dis-
played publicly their dislike for the
new regulation. Student demonstra-
tions against the ruling occurred on
Sunday and Monday nights, Octo-
ber 3 and 4. According to the Octo-
ber 10, 1954 edition of The Sun-
bury Item, the first manifestation
against the ban occurred late Sun-
day night when between 300 and
350 students left a campus bonfire
and paraded through the streets of
Lewisburg to Second and Market
Streets where a sit-down strike in
the intersection was quickly broken
up by two officers of the Milton
detail of state police, the demon-
strations offering no violent opposi-
tion. “The parade was accompanied
by a chanting for beer, which was
continued back on campus after the
state police officers indicated that
they would brook no further fool-
ishness,” read the Item.

The following night, a sec-
ond, less impressive, but larger
exhibition brought approximatcly
500 members of the student body to
Market Street, but after about 45
minutes of leaderless activity, the
group returned peaceably to cam-
pus where the songs and chants
“We want beer” continued until
about 11:30 when most of the
group returned to fraternities and
dormitories. The /tem clarified, “In
both displays of opposition by the
students, no property damage
resulted nor were there any injuries
reported.

In its issue following the
demonstration, The Bucknellian
devoted about one and one-third
pages to the liquor ban. The editors
repeatedly voiced their assent with
and support of the sentiment
expressed in the demonstration.
However, they also concluded that
because of the demonstrations, any
chance for repeal of the prohibition
law had been lost. In the October 7,
1954, issue of The Bucknellian, this
conclusion is embodied in an edito-
rial entitled, “Sound and Fury,
Accomplishing Nothing,” which
admitted, “The best interests of the
student body were not served by
the demonstrations. Just when it
seemed that the Student Faculty
Congress and the Interfraternity
Council were about to effect a
reconsideration of the recent ruling
by the Executive Committee, bed-
lam broke loose.” On_ students
defeating their own purpose, the
editors commented, “We hope our
fatalistic attitude will not discou-
rage responsible leaders in Student
Faculty Congress and the Interfra-
ternity Council from working out a
compromise plan. It should have
been their problem all along.”

While the gatherings here
in 1990 served more to bring an
issue immediately to the forefront
thereby accelerating an adjustment
process, the “beer riots of 1954"
resulted only in solidifying an
already universally —_ accepted
change in policy. Despite the con-
trast in the two demonstrations’
ramifications, the issues and the
rhetoric are strikingly concurrent.

News
Analysis

buildings,

To explain the contradictory results
of the “riots”, one needs only to be
reminded of the very different psy-
chological environment in which
the 1954 commotion took place.

The Executive Committee
decision was supported both inter-
nally and externally by the Buck-
nell community at the time of the
1954 prohibition. The Bucknell
University Father’s Association
went on record as unconditionally
endorsing the Universities stand on
alcoholic beverages. The two gov-
eming bodies of the students, the
Women’s Student Government
Association and the Men’s Student
Assembly, expressed to Bucknell
University their sincere regret “for
the detrimental publicity resulting
from the recent demonstration.”

Disregarding for the moment
the moral and historical back-
ground involved, the university
officials were practically compelled
to recognize the fact that a large
percentage of the student body was
underage, and that to repeal the reg-
ulation would, in effect, condone
the breaking of the Pennsylvania
State Laws. The press coverage
depicting the peaceful gatherings as
“juvenile displays” drew so much
widespread attention to the pro-
tests, that the administration could
not possibly announce a_ policy
repeal without receiving much criti-
cism. Coupled with this priority to
preserve the public image was a
community that, in addition to
already limiting its sale of alcoholic
beverages to beer, was highly relig-
ious and exemplified a morality
that typified the 1950's mentality.

The salient subject for discus-
sion here, though, is not a policy or
a riot, but more important are the
issues that arouse a student body to
unify and collectively protest a situ-
ation in which it is seemingly com-
pelled to live. Once an analysis
goes beyond identifying surface
similarities of the 1954 and 1990
circumstances by comparing the
real issues and what the people said
and felt about them, the scenarios
are very much compatible. In the
Thursday, October 7, 1954 edition
of The Bucknellian, the editors
asserted, “We feel that the adminis-
tration should be roundly con-
demned for forcing upon the stu-
dents a ruling so sudden in its
effect without even consulting their
elected representatives.” The Sun-
bury Item of October 6, 1954,
stated that the senior class met and
had, by majority vote, adopted a
resolution condemning the Univer-
sity’s action, One student spoke,
saying that, “While the University
seems to feel that only a minority
of the students is interested in the
matter, I believe that the entire stu-
dent body has reacted violently to
the edict.” He also asserted that the
main reason for the adoption of the
resolution was that “students felt
that they had not been given a
chance to police the drinking prob-
lem themselves, that suggestions
presented by the Interfraternity
Council had been ignored and
action taken without consulting
them.” Other students expressed a
similar viewpoint indicating that
“the demonstrations may not be so
much against the action taken by
the University’s Executive Com-
mittee as the manner in which it
was taken.”

These are the kinds of feel-
ings with which today’s Bucknell
students have been most
acquainted, Statements such as
these manifest an absence of repre-
sentation and normal channels of
protest by which authority figures
are checked. In the October 14,
1954 issue of The Bucknellian, a
writer claims, “There are those who
say that the ‘riots’ were childish
and immature. If the conditions on
our campus had been different, I
might be inclined to agree. Some-
times, however, when no conven-
tional or democratic process is_
available for appealing a grievance,
more radical methods must be
used.” In the October 21 edition at
a meeting with student leaders and
the members of the Executive
Committee, the participants felt
that “better communications
between the student body and
administration is what is needed.”

The Bucknellian

Halloween incident reveals
parallels to beer riots of 1954

In 1954 it was realized that stu-
dent participation through its effec-
tively powerless student groups
was non-existent. Over the next
months this problem was actively
addressed. By 1956 at an Executive
Committee mecting with student
leaders, according to the meeting’s
minutes, the Committee reaffirmed
the policy established in 1949 by
the Board of Trustees, believing
that it reflected the traditional atti-
tude of Bucknell University and
was in its best interest. The state-
ment of policy reads: “Possession
or use of alcoholic beverages on the
campus including fraternity houses,
is completely opposed to the best
interests of Bucknell and any use
thereof resulting in discredit to
Bucknell should be handled with
the utmost severity.”

Ultimately, then, the student
voice was heard. Prohibition was
realized to be contrary to the basic
purpose of the University to teach
discrimination and judgement. Stu-
dents must be given the chance to
develop and prove themselves
capable in the area of self-
government. Not prohibiting is no
longer thought of as condoning the
violation of state laws—a_ belief
which characteristic of a mentality
which methods and definitions are
inappropriate and inapplicable to
today’s college life. Today, the
concern is not necessarily focussed
on preventing the consumption of
alcohol but more on_ ensuring
responsible drinking and the
exemption from liabilities. What
has been found is that to accom-
plish this goal most effectively, stu-
dents must do the majority of the
patrolling themselves.

Upon this realization begins
a movement toward the ideal situa-
tion in which the very same indi-
viduals that the University is trying
to protect and prepare will collec-
tively and responsibly look out for
one another. Instead of creating its
own problems from within, all par-
ties involved will be better enabled
to pursue those goals which they all

ultimately share. As long as stu-
dents are responsible, the Univer-
sity will not take steps to repossess
the autonomy with which the stu-
dents have been entrusted. The
term “responsibility”, however,
tends to cause one to think of an
additional burden. Also inherent in
the idea of responsibility is the
option to not live up to it; to fall
short of its fulfillment. To better
insure that the responsibility is ful-
filled, students should at least view
their improved social situation
more as a privilege. The term privi-
lege, in contrast, indicates some-
thing of value with which one
would be most disinclined to part.
With this perspective, each individ-
ual will be most effective in ensur-
ing that this responsibility is ful-
filled by not allowing himself or
those around him to jeopardize or
exploit the privilege.

By way of looking back over
the course of events both in 1954
and 1990, it is concluded that the
people involved were not a group
of unfortunate individuals caught
coincidentally in a momentary tran-
sition. The removal of the spotlight
from the subject may suggest that
the experience is fleeting in nature.
The issue is part of never-ending
debate and process involving deep
evaluations of what is moral and
just, that will always shape the defi-
nition of what is in “the best inter-
ests” of society. Here at Bucknell,
students have been well repre-
sented. The improvements that are
in the making addressing the most
pressing of student concerns dem-
onstrate an administration-student
relationship that no longer culti-
vates a student frustration with the
whole political process. With a
more mature and realistic perspec-
tive, both the Administration and
the students have responded very
well to this very tough interest con-
flict—a kind of struggle that stands
the test of time—by realizing that
only in an environment of openness
and cooperation can they harmoni-
ously coexist

DeCerchio clarifies
enforcement policy

By Mark Leister
Staff Writer

Amid rumors of inconsistent
University alcohol policy enforce-
ment, Vincent DeCerchio, director
of security and safety, sent a letter
to members of the Greck commu
nity in an attempt to clarify mis
conceptions about sccurity’s role
DeCerchio explained that his plan
for a “fair and reasonable enforce
ment policy,” though not harass-
ing like past policies, would “not
give any member of the university
community the license to misbe
have or to violate the law.”

DeCerchio’s Ictter, which
linked responsible student action
to the right of sclf-determination,
was intended to give students
some understanding of _ the
changes DeCerchio will imple-
ment. DeCerchio expanded on his
letter by stating, “Some members
of the community felt that my
approach to enforcement of the
university alcohol policy would be
interpreted as leniency or giving
in. I felt it was important for me to
clarify my purpose.”

His intention, he explained,
is to combine the enforcement of
Commonwealth laws with the
respect that students, as adults,
deserve.

cards everybody. That would be
considered a form of harassment.’
DeCerchio believes that his plan
of enforcement contrasts a time
when “past enforcement may have

exceeded the requirements of the
law.”

Mike Domingucz ’91, presi-
dent of the Inter-fraternity Coun-
cil, sees DeCerchio’s intentions as
positive and truc to actions thus
far. ‘““We’re not finding [sccurity]
sitting in the parking lot any
longer, or making any unncces-
sary inspections.” Dominguez
appears realistic, however, in his
assessment that, though “enforce-
ment has decreased over the year,
security isn’t going to just
disappear.”

But DeCerchio stands will-
ing to at least stand back and give
students a chance. In his letter, he
demonstrated a “firm conviction
that university students have the
capabilities to govern them-
selves.” If self-governance proves
incffective, however, “someone
will be assigned to do it for [the
Dominguez felt
DeCerchio, through his statement,

wanted to re-emphasize his com-
mitment to enforcing the law.”

However, a complement to
the proposal of student self-
governance is the Student Advi-
sory Committce for Security and
Safety. Student and administrator
committee-members, meeting for
the first time today, will strive
toward a set of
guidelines by which Security can
operate and the university commu-
nity can live

Dominguez, who is “pleased
with the attitudes displayed by fra-
ternity leaders and their willing-
ness to work with security,” sees
the changes in a positive light.

By not playing by the rules, we’d
only be hurting ourselves.”

Milton man
charged

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

Following a joint investiga-
tion by East Buffalo Township and
Lewisburg Police, Richard A. Diehl
of Milton faces criminal charges
for a number of incidents involving
indecent exposure which occurred
on or near the Bucknell campus

Dichl, 28, was charged with
five counts of indecent exposure,
five counts of harrassment, five
conduct and
one count of criminal attempt stem-

counts of disorderly
ming from indecent exposure.
Charges

November 29 with District Justice

were filed on

Leo S. Armbruster. The five inci-
indecent exposure
occurred within the borough of
November

dents of

Court protects
suspects’ rights

The Supreme Court voted 6-
2 on Tuesday to limit police in the
questioning of without
counsel. In a decision which over-
turned a 1988 Mississippi Supreme
Court ruling, the Court decided that
once a suspect has asserted his
right to a lawyer, police cannot
interrogate him until the lawyer is
present

Justice

suspects

Anthony M. Ken-
nedy, who wrote the majority opin-
ion said the Mississippi ruling did
not protect suspects against “coer-
cive pressures” by police. Accord
ing to the Mississippi ruling, once
a suspect was provided with a law
yer, police could question a sus-
pected criminal regardless of
whether the lawyer was present.

Kennedy claimed the ruling
was necessary to preserve the Fifth
Amendment, which protects
against self-incrimination

Justice Antonin Scalia wrote
a dissenting opinion and was
joined by Chief Justice William
Reinquist

Tuesday’s decision was part
of a series of rulings dealing wtih
suspects’ rights. The first was
Miranda v. Arizona in 1966, in
which the Court determined that
police have to stop interrogating a
criminal suspect if he requests the
assistance of a lawyer. In a 1981
ruling which helped  enforece
Miranda, Edwards v. Arizona, the
Supreme Court determined that

Planes collide,
killing eight

A Northwest Airlines 727,
trying to lift off from a slushy
Detroit runway, clipped into the
right engine of a McDonnell-
Douglas DC-9 killing eight per-
sons. All eight, seven passengers
and one flight attendent, were on
board the DC-9 which was taxing
toward another runway. Also, 22
passengers received treatment for
injurics at a nearby hospital.

The reason for the crash was
unclear. No evidence indicated why
the 727 had strayed from its run-
way. No officials from the Detroit
Metropolitan airport would say
whether the plane had been cleared
for take-off.

Conditions were poor and,
due to fog and a morning snow
storm, runways had been closed to
landing planes. Visibility on the
runway where the 727 had begun
its take-off was a quarter mile,
about one-sixth the lenghth of the
runway.

According to Tony Dresden,
spokesman for the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association,
preliminary reports seemed to show
that the DC-9 “got lost” and taxied
onto the runway in front of the
approaching 727. The 727, in an
attempt to avoid a collision tried to
take off carly, but instead hit the
tail of the DC-9.

Ozal advocates
action in Gulf

Turgut Ozal, president of
Turkey, reported Tuesday that he
supports the use of force in the Per-
sian Gulf and urged his own nation
to send troops to Saudi Arabia to
assist in the event of a war against
Iraq. In addition, Ozal advocates
allowing the United States to use
an important military base in Tur-
key. No decision has been made by
the Turkish government concern-
ing either issue.

“The conditions are chang-
ing, and if they change, we may
make a decision to send troops. It
is just a possibility now,” said
Turkish Prime Minister Yildirim
Akbulut.

Ozal’s proposals came after
several meetings with top officials
in Washington. Ozal met with
President Bush, Secretary of State
James Baker, and Defense Secre-
tary Dick Cheney, but said he
could do nothing until after the
United Nations Security Council
ratified the proposal to use “all
necessary means” in dealing with
Saddam Hussein.

At a meeting with senior
government officials Ozal pro-
posed increased Turkish involve-
ment in the crisis. Gen. Necip
Torumtay, chief of the Turkish
armed forces, strongly objected to
Ozal’s suggestions to strengthen
Turkey’s role in the possible war
against Iraq, its neighbor to the
south. Torumtay resigned from his
post on Monday, apparently as a
protest to Ozal’s proposal. His
replacement, Gen. Dogan Gures,
has been in agreement with Torum-
lay on Many past issues.

The abrupt resignation drew
attention to the split which sul
exists, between top officials, as to
what action should be taken in the
Persian Gulf.

Argentine
rebels atiack
bases

Just days before President
Bush’s scheduled arrival in Argen
tina, several hundred army dissi-
dents captured the headquarters of
the Argentine army and four other
installations. Three people were
killed in the violence which broke
out early Monday morning

In answer to President Carlos
Saul Menem’s demand for a com-
plete rebel loyalist
troops acted quickly to retake the
installations. By after
continuous reverberations of auto-
matic weapons being fired through
the capital, the loyalists declared
that all was under control

After a day of combat, loyal-
ists said they had succeeded in
retaking all sites captured by the
rebel army. Loyalists took nearly
300 rebels as prisoners

It took loyalist troops two
hours of intense fighting to regain
the Libertador Building, in which
the Argentine army headquarters
are located. Fighting continued
throughout the day and the pres-
ence of four warplanes suggestcd
the possibility of bombing. Neither
side dropped any bombs.

Dissidents and loyalists con-
tinued sending off rounds with
automatic weapons as rush hour
traffic drove by the scene of the

surrender,

evening,

fighting. Bullcts riddled the sides of
cars and bus

The rebellion was the fourth
staged by dissidents in the six years
since Argentina formed its civilian
government.

Even after all the pandemo-
nium caused by the day’s events,
Bush still made the trip to Argen-
tina, On Wednesday night, he
stayed in the residence of the
American ambassador.

Germans elect
Kohl's coalition

In the first free election since
1932, the people of a united Ger-
many endorsed Chancellor Helmut
Kohl’s coalition. Kohl is the leader
of the Christian Democratic Party.

Results of the parliamentary
elections indicate an
endorsement of the German unifi-
cation. The newly elected leader-
ship is nearly the same as the
administration of West Germany
during the tearing down of the Ber-
lin Wall in November 1989.

Election results showed that
the Christian Democrats won 44.7
percent of the votes. Still short of a
majority, Kohl’s party will have to
form a coalition

As was anticipated, the par-
tics which opposed German unifi-
cation fared poorly at the polls.
Computer projections gave the
Social Democrats only 33.5 percent
of the votes. The Free Democratic
Party received 11 percent and the
Party of Democratic Socialism
managed to win 9.4 percent of the
vote, enough to secure 14 seats in
Parliament.

Police fine TKE
for violations

Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity
received fines of $1000 for provid-
ing minors with alcohol and $300
for a count of disorderly conduct in
an September incident. The fines
came after fraternity president
Mark Roessler pleaded guilty to the
offenses.

In addition to the fines, set by
District Justice Leo S. Armbruster,
the fraternity will be on probation
for a year.

The charges came after three
fraternity members agreed, at a pre-
liminary hearing, to testify that the
fraternity had furnished alcohol for
three minors present at a party at 38
South Fifth Street.

Lewisburg police _filed
charges against Roessler on
November 2. Lewisburg police also
charged each of the three—Stephen
Casey 91, David Gutheil ’91, and
Brandon Poe ’91—with one count
of furnishing minors with alcohol
and one count of disorderly
conduct.

The names of the two minors

involved in the incident did not
appear on the affidavit to Arm-
bruster. The two minors had been
arrested and admitted to consuming
alcohol at the September 15 party.

Police dropped a_ second
count against the fraternity for fur-
nishing alcohol to a minor

Protesters print
fake newspaper

An anti-war statement sent
the campus of the State University
of New York (SUNY) at Bingham-
ton into turmoil Wednesday, when
a group of students issued a fake
edition of the campus newspaper
with front page headlines proclaim-
ing that the United States had
invaded Iraq and that SUNY stu-
dents had been drafted.

Members of a radical student
group, Looking Left, used the for-
mat of Pipe Dream, the student
newspaper published twice weekly.
Headlines which read “U.S.
Invades Iraq” and “SUNY Bin-
ghamton Students Drafted”
shocked students and staff who
believed the nation had indeed
gone to war.

Both articles ended with dis-
claimers which read, “The events
described above have not hap-
pened. Yet. But they may.” Still,
students and staff overlooked these
disclaimers and embraced the real-
ity of war,

Based on information from
the bogus newspaper, the college
radio station broadcast news that
the nation had entered into war
with Iraq.

_ David L. Anderson, acting
vice president for student affairs,
was appalled by the incident.

Many students do rely on their stu-
dent newpaper for current events.
And Many reacted to how legiti-
mate it appeared. It looked just like
the Pipe Dream,” he said.

: After the incident, the univer-
Sity distibuted 4000 fliers inform-
ing students that the United States
was not at war and that the Pipe
Dream was not responsible for the
issue.

Pipe Dream intends to sue
members of Looking Left.

period, SAMS will give away
hundreds of donated prizes.
“We're going to give away
approximately 20 an hour,” said
Krakoff.

Each of the more than 500
Prizes are donations from individ-
uals, organizations and busi-
nesses. Trustee Ken Langone,
*37, donated two tickets each to
Florida and California. The Buck-
nell Bookstore donated some of
its merchandise, and many of the
merchants of Lewisburg also con-
tributed items to be given away as
door prize:

National organizations, too,
contributed to the cause. Disney-
land donated two admission tick-
ets, L..A. Gear donated two pairs
of shoes, and The Gap donated a
$35 gift certificate.

Several organizations con-
tributed money to help SAMS get
the project off the ground. BSG
appropriated $313 to SAMS. The
$399 from Committee on Student
Programming went to printing
posters. The Interfratemity Coun-
cil and the Residence Hall Associ-
ation also contributed money.

Organizers of the dance
decided on a point system to
determine the winning organiza-
tion. The total money a group
earns will be divided by the num-
ber of organization members and
multiplied by 100. An organiza-
tion will gain 10 points for every
hour a member dances and will
lose 20 points for every hour in
which no one dances. Bonus
points will be awarded for every
person in a group who dances the
entire 24 hours. Groups will gain
points based on the number of stu-
dents and faculty who come for
support. The group with the best
theme hour will win 100 points.
Teams that win contests during
different theme hours will also be
awarded points.

Students not registered on a
tag team will find other types of
entertainment. Bucknell Activities
Council (BAC) has rented a large
foot piano, similar to the one in
“BIG.” SAMS will charge stu-
dents 50 cents to play a tune, and
for two dollars students can
record a song in a sound record-
ing booth rented by the Bison Pro-
gramming Committee.

As students dance and par-
ticipate in other activities, mem-
bers of Amnesty Internaional will
letters in

write
increased

support of

research.

Dancers also will be given
plenty of food breaks. Some of
the organizations hosting theme
hours will provide food. In addi-
tion, area food businesses have
provided food for both dancers
and workcrs.

Throughout the dance,
beginning at midnight and contin-
uing until dinner at 5 p.m. Satur-
day, food breaks will come
approximately every four hours.
The first break will include pizza,
ice cream, and cookies sponsored
by Domino’s Pizza, Lickety Split,
and McDonald’s. Area food
chains will also provide food for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

In conjunction with their
theme hours, the Bison Volun-
teers will provide sundaes at 4
a.m., and BAC will sponsor a
popcorn break at 8 a.m.

Students who are not danc-
ing will be able to buy food at the
Bison, which has agreed to
remain open for all 24 hours.

According to Krakoff, once
it seemed like most students were
willing to participate in the dance,
the committee switched its focus
to faculty and administration.
Both the Division of Student Life
and the biology department
signed up tag teams. The faculty
challenge hour has been set up to
encourage members of depart-
ments to participate in the event.
The department which has the
greatest percent of its constitu-
ency present will be treated to a
brunch the following day.

In addition to faculty, and
members of the SAMS steering
committee will attend the lunch-
eon. “Basically it’s just a nice
way of saying thank you. It’s a
nice way to bring the students and
faculty together,” said Jen Hunt,
’93, a member of the committee.

Wendy Shaver, °92, co-
chair of the Dance-for-a-Chance
committee, presented the idea to
SAMS after seeing a_ similar
dance marathon at Penn State. “I
was amazed by how much it
brought their campus together,”
she said. s

The program at Penn State
lasted 48 hours and raised
$650,000. “We knew that based
on our size, we would never get
that much,” said Krakoff.

SAMS has invited people
with MS, a disease which usually
first shows up in college students,
to come to the dance during the
SAMS theme hour, from 11 a.m.
to noon tomorrow.

approved by the trustees on Satur-
day morning.”

Idleman clarified the position
of the majority of the trustees say-
ing, “There were two basic con-
cerns, the falling pool of applicants
and the economic tumble. The
question is how deep or how long
the downturn will last. We have
approved every budget that I can
remember.”

In discussing the rationality
behind the trustee decision, Max-
well said, “Their [the trustees’]
concern is that all other schools on
the list are pricing themselves at
too high a level and will end up
having difficulty in the future. That
was the view not of all the trustees
but of a significant number of
trustees.”

Maxwell also mentioned that
the lower increase in the compre-

hensive fee should be viewed as a
one-year aberration caused by a
concern on the part of the trustees
over the state of the economy. He
emphasized that this is not a trajec-
tory course for the University.

Micheal Moohr, associate
professor of economics, claimed
that the finance committee’s propo-
sal to cut the proposed budget
makes the goal of reducing the stu-
dent-to-faculty ratio more difficult
to achieve. Moohr did say, “We
still plan to add about three faculty
positions for the academic year
91-92, instead of the five we
wanted.”

Moohr said, “The finance
committee has proposed a rate
increase of 4.5 percent which they
believe will be the rate of inflation
in fiscal 91-92. Currently, inflation
is running at about 6.5 percent.”
According to Moohr, the disparity
in the two estimates of the inflation

Budgetary process
proves to be complex

By Travis Elliot
Staff Writer

The budgetary process begins

in the fall semester with the planning

and budget committee. The planning and budget committee examines a
variety of budget scenarios and tradeoffs. They make a recommendation
to the office of the president. The planning and budget committee makes a

recommendation for major revenue

options which are tuition, room and

board, and they also make a recommendation about the major expendi-
tures such as salaries or increases in faculty or staff. Those are the major
guidelines that are recommended to the office of the president. In most
instances the office of the president accepts that budget proposal. The
office of the president then makes a recommendation to the trustees
though the trustee budget committee, and that budget committee makes its
recommendation to the finance committee. It is the finance committee that
makes the final recommendation to the board of trustees.

rates would imply a real cut equal
to two percent.

Furthermore, in a memoran-
dum to the members of the plan-
ning and budget committe, Moohr
stressed the difference between the
Consumer Price Index and the
Higher Education Price Index.
Moohr noted that the types of
goods purchased by the average
consumer are not the same type of
goods that are purchased by higher
education institutions.

In a letter to the faculty,
Larry Shinn, vice president for aca-
demic affairs, wrote, “Since the
Trustee’s mandate refers to the
comprehensive fee only, the faculty
and staff salary increase should still
be above 5 percent even with the
4.5 percent comprehensive fee limi-
tation. While there is no formal
agreement with the Board on fixing
comprehensive fees, there are

agreed-upon guidelines for begin-
ning to fix salaries and wages.
While we may not be able to mect
the original target (6.2 percent), we
will make every effort to come as
close as possible.”

Idclman said, “We [the trus-
tccs] have a responsibility to keep
the institution solvent and viable.
Should this be a serious economic
downturn, this may be a prudent
step on behalf of the trustees.”

Moohr said, “It is amazing
that we are able to remain competi-
live with these institutions given
our poor endowment and lower
comprehensive fee.”

Sojka wrote, “In my conclud-
ing comments at the Board meet-
ing, I made it quite clear that I was
disappointed at the Board’s deci-
sion and that I considered the
action on the budget to be a
mistake.”

Bison Tales

By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

Lights, gifts, sleigh-bells...baaah, Humbug...maybe you pco-
ple who attend different universities that Ict out at normal times have
nothing better to do than sing about Reindecrs with physical defor-
mities, but I’ve got exams to take. So stay out of my way or I'll tell
Santa to fill your stocking with “New Bison” propaganda pins, or
maybe I'll inform Prancer about that Venison you had last month
and suggest that he leave you a little surprise in your cgg nog.

Ahem...Sorry, I wasn’t always this much of a cutthroat; I
think it’s the general atmosphere around here. Everyone scems to be
walking around in sweat-pants or jeans (standard exam-time attirc)
and mumbling about how “stressed” they are. Just yesterday, as I
entered the library behind a spectacled student who was grimacing
under the weight of his bulging back-pack, I politely smiled and
quipped, “Guess you’ve got a few books to read...ha ha.” But the
guy just looked at me like I was a used Q-tip and proceeded to bel-
ligerently flip the metal entry-bar forcefully back into my hips while
he made a break for the study carrels on the top floor.

The Mac lab has also been taken over by jean-clad study-
slaves, frantically typing out their ten-page papers (that are duc in 45
minutes) while isolating themselves behind their blaring Walkmans
and cursing violently when their Appleshare “Chooser” doesn’t
work. Meanwhile, all the lab late-comers, who were not quick
enough to secure a computer, hover around waiting for that litle
whirring sound (which means that a disk is being ejected and some-
one might be leaving) so that they can dash across the room and
claim their prize

Actually, the preceding scenario would be an ideal sctting for
one of those psychedelic Levi's Jeans commercials where a button-
fly-wearing student speaks frankly to the camera while a mournful
harmonica sounds in the background.

Hi, My name's Dan and I love to party with my pals. But when
study-time comes around I get serious and Slip into my good ol’
501's. They're real comfortable, and their unique button-fly design
gives me extra flexibility to beat unfriendly students away from the
computers with my disk drive. Heh, Heh

The idea would be straight-forward and casy to understand; the
way commercials were when we were kids. Back then it was an
understood fact that since everybody’s idol...Michacl Jackson,
drinks Pepsi, we should all drink it too. Of course, following that
logic we also should have had several million dollars of cosmetic
surgery and blown up our hair in public. It was also a known fact
that all fun-loving and carefree people drove Suzuki Samurais. In
fact, anyone who didn’t drive a Samurai was considered an uptight
looser with the sexual appeal of a month-old urine specimen who the
Suzuki drivers would point and laugh at...until they tried to apply
the brake and found themselves flipping uncontrollably into a gravel
pit.

But nowadays commercials are impossible to understand. Like
the ad for Levi’s S05's with the incredibly stupid looking guy whose
great claim to fame is that that he can talk backwards. Somchow I
find it really hard to picture a consumer watching that particular
commercial and saying, “Oh Wow!!! That really cool guy who
TALKS BACKWARDS is wearing 505's...1 better run out and get a
pair right now!” No. This would not happen. . . Especially since it
has been proven that men who have traded in their 505's for Bugle
Boy brand jeans will in fact, randomly meet beautiful women who
drive up to them in red convertible sports cars, stare at their crotch,
and drive away.

Alright, I probably should stop discussing commercials,
because I’m beginning to get really frustrated. In fact, I don’t think I
have been so annoyed since last year around this same time. I was
trying to get some decent sleep the night before my 8 a.m. cconom-
ics final, when I was awakened at 3:30 in the moming by the enthu-
siastic retching of a few of my hallmates. They had already finished
all of their exams and immediately set out to obliterate any tiny elec-
trons of knowledge that still might be clinging to their brain cells;
arriving back at the dorm just in time to purge themselves in our
lounge (located directly across from my room). I managed to ignore
the pungent scent drifting under the door and was on my way back to
sleep until someone, who had evidently been sorting through the
appetizing puddle shouted, “Hey! I just found an onion!!! Did you
eat a quarter-pounder or something?!?” After inspecting their discov-
ery and deciding that it really was an onion, my hallmates then
agreed that 4:00 in the morning would be a perfect time for a rousing
game of Indoor Lacrosse. With the loser having to walk barefoot
through...I’m sure you get the idea.

The next morning, after struggling through my 3-hour test, I
headed back to the room to pack my things. I thought I had placed
the previous night’s ordeal behind me, but I guess my lack of sleep
had mutated my ordinarily kind disposition...When | spotted
“Onion-man” (his new nick-name) heading towards the showers I
silently followed him and waited cautiously outside the door. Then,
just when his shampoo should have been developing into a thick
eye-threatening lather, I bust into the bathroom and simultancously
flushed all four commodes giving him a scalding surprizc. “YRREM
SAMTSIRHC” I shouted as I bolted out the door superfast in my
form-fitting 505's.

Behind the scenes in the bookstore...

Buying and selling textbooks

By Lisa Lipari
Staff Writer

As the end of the semester
approaches, many students are pre-
paring for finals and are looking
forward to the holiday season. It is
also a time when many students
spend a little more money than
usual and the extra money obtained
from selling back textbooks really
comes in handy.

Marlene Wertz, textbook
buyer at the our bookstore is also
preparing for next semester’s stock.
Wertz, who has been with the
bookstore for 11 years, said that, on
the average, about 1500 titles are
ordered per semester. These books
are ordered from several places,
including cight wholesale distribu-
tors (who dcal with used books)
and several publishers (who sell
new books).

When books are requested by
professors for the following semes-
ter, Wertz checks the stockroom
here first. She then calls the whole-
salers and asks them to hold the
number of books that are still
necded. After the student buyback
period at Bucknell, Wertz then calls
the wholesaler again and either
orders more books or tells them to
cancel the order, depending upon
how many books were sold back to
the bookstore. If a wholesaler does
not have a certain title, it will be
ordered through the publisher.
However, because of the rising cost

of new textbooks, Wertz said that
she tries to order as many used text-
books as possible, even though it’s
more time consuming.

Although many students may
not believe it, the average cost of
textbooks per student per year is
$363.44, which is 2.07% of a

year’s tuition. At buyback, stu-
dents can get, at most, 50% of the

Using recycled products on cam-
pus aids world trash problems

By Christine Phillips

Why has recycling suddenly
become a major issue in America?
Perhaps because the fact that we
are running out of places to put our
garbage has finally slapped us right
in the face.

By the year 1991, half of the
landfills in the nation will close,
and almost no one wants a new one
built in his or her proverbial (or lit-
eral) backyard. The average Ameri-
can generates 3.5 pounds of gar-
bage every day. That’s 160 million
tons per

duction is double that of = and siaff
any other country. also buy

nationally.

Total U.S.
waste pro-
duction per
person Is
double that
of any other country in the world.

A great deal of what goes
into landfills is paper—almost
40%. If half of just the newsprint
that is thrown away every year in
the United States were recycled, six
million tons of waste (that’s 3200
garbage trucks every day) would
not have to be put into landfills. If
the 20 million tons of waste paper
that was recycled in 1989 had been
sent to a landfill instead, it would
have taken up an area of six square
miles by ten feet deep.

Many people assume that
paper which is put into landfills
will degrade after a couple of years,
but this is not the case. Enough
oxygen is not present in the fills to
support the microorganisms which
break the paper down. Paper that
has been in landfills for 15 years
has been found intact and often
readable.

This doesn’t mean that every-
one should just fling paper across
the countryside because it has a bet-
ter chance of degrading in the open
air, but should think seriously about

where the paper thrown away is
going. It does matter if that paper
ends up in the recycling bin. Aside
from the whole landfill space
saving reason, recycling just one
ton of paper also:
—keeps 60 Ibs. of pollution from
entering the air
—saves 17 trees
—saves 7000 gallons of water
—creates five times as many jobs
as producing paper from virgin
wool pulp.
Bucknell is doing its part to
promote the recycling of paper. Not
only do
recy-
cle, but
students,
faculty,

recycled
paper products as well. According
to Jim Muchler of Administrative
Services, approximately 30% of the
paper that is purchased for use on
campus by them contains recycled
fiber.

For the past year, various
types of recycled paper also have
been tested for the copy machines.
Copy paper makes up a_ large
amount of the campus demand. So
far none of the recycled alternatives
have worked very well. Apparently,
the recycled paper is not as crisp as
paper make from virgin fiber, and it
jams the machines. Once an accept-
able brand is found, however, the
amount of recycled paper being
used on campus should jump to
70%!

Even the bookstore has begun
to order more recycled paper prod-
ucts—stationery, cards, and wrap-
ping paper. Many others will be
available starting next semester.
Perhaps with Bucknell’s continued
recycling efforts, that 160 million
tons of garbage per year will be
reduced in the years to come.

simply didn’t return in the requisi-
tion form by the deadline (May Ist
for the fall semester, November 10
for the spring), then the bookstore
can only offer the wholcsaler’s
valuc. Wertz suggests checking
throughout the week if a requisi-
tion has not been returned. “It
comes at a bad time for [the profes-
sors], but it is necessary for us to
get the information as early as pos-
sible for the students’ benefit.”

Wertz also said that many
students are confused when they
see the signs posted for 50% buy-
back rate on books and don’t
reccive this amount. For this rca-
son, Wertz posts the bookstore’s
policy for buyback, and the buy-
back book is updated daily to
include any requisitions that come
in. Most books can be sold back to
the bookstore, unless they are lab
workbooks with the answers writ-
ten in ink or if the book has tcar-
out pages. The condition of the
book does not matter (unless it is
very badly shclf-worm), and Wertz
said that writing in texts or high-
lighting is okay.

Students have the option to
hold a book and scll it the follow-
ing semester for a better rate. For
example, if a course is only offered
in the fall, the text used will proba-
bly not be requested for the spring
semester. Therefore, it would be
more beneficial to wait a semester

Dear

Dear Wanda,

I don’t have any money
left—what should I do about
holiday gifts? I don’t think I
can afford presents for my fam-
ily this year, much less for my
friends!

Running on Fumes

Dear R.OLF.,

I doubt that you really need
any additional stress during this
wonderful time of the semester
Don’t worry about gifts. First of
all, I’m sure the vast majority of
your friends are in the same posi-
tion money-wise. Talk to them
about it - many of the pcople |
know have a policy of not
exchanging gifts with fricnds
because they are all impoverished
college students. If you feel that
you must get something for them,
keep it simple. Fricnds here
would probably love something
to munch on while studying for
finals. Bake cookies and put them
on holiday plates, fill a mug with
candy, etc. Your fricnds at home
will feel the same - no matter
how cheesy it sounds, it is the
thought that counts. If you put
some time and effort into a gift,
the cost is irrelevant.

Family presents are gener-
ally more mandatory. Try going
in with a brother or sister for a
parent’s gift. If you fecl you must
do it alone, you still have options.
The time/effort/love more than
expense rule is even more true
for family. Even when you were
in third grade didn’t your parents
still like the handmade presents
best? Or maybe they just pre-
tended for your sake. But really,
they know you don’t have a lot of
money and they won’t expect
elaborate gifts. In terms of money
- remember that you’ll be selling
books back and may get some
cash from that. You can always
put off the payment by charging

and sce if it is requested again for
the fall. (The student would then
receive the 50% the buyback rate.)
Even if it is not requested, the stu-
dent can always sell it for the
wholesale value they would have
received anyway. However, most
students don’t want to wait and
would rather have the money right
away. Wertz pointed out that if the
copyright date of the text is old,
the student may want to sell it as
soon as possible, because the text
could very well be replaced with a
newer edition.

As for returning newly pur-
chased books at the beginning of a
semester, students have the first
two wecks to do so. Wertz said
that the date is always posted, and
that there is a three to four day
grace period. (Students must have
their receipt to return books.)

Wertz fecls that the system
works well for both the students’
and the professors’ benefit. She
said that she understands that the
books are a large expense, and
because of this she tries hard to get
the best valuc for the students. She
also tries hard to honor the
requests of each professor and to
obtain for them the books they
need

So.if you have any questions,
go to the bookstore and ask! And
when you're selling your books
back, remember: read the signs!

Growth or decay?
Fee hike would be positive...

It is ironic that the trustees’ attempt to improve the competitiveness of Bucknell has actually become a first

step toward decay. The trustees maintain that exceeding a 4.5% increase in comprehensive fees would adversely

ffect Bucknell’s ability to compete in a tight market. On the contrary, lower revenues will yield a decline in the
quality of this University and its number of applicants.

For an institution which has a relatively poor endowment and relies largely on tuition income for operating
yenses, Bucknell cannot afford to forego a possible increase in the comprehensive fee. It represents a loss in
tential revenues which can never be made up.

The administration describes the proposed increase, the lowest budget increase in 25 years, as a one-year
iberration that does not represent a new trajectory course for the University. We can only hope so. If the trustees
find it appropriate to continue on this same path, Bucknell will eventually fall into the category of stagnant,
jeclining Universities.

Of course, a demographics argument has some merit. The more that the comprehensive fee is increased, the
more difficult it becomes for Bucknell to attract a group of students with a diverse economic background. This
must not be a deterrent to increasing the comprehensive fee; rather, the focus must be shifted to the University’s

ndowment and financial aid capabilities

Indeed, the long-term solution to the problems of economic diversity and competitiveness centers around

need to increase the University’s endowment. In comparison to the frame of reference schools, Bucknell’s
jowment is one of the lowest. With a relatively larger endowment, not only could economic diversity be pro-

i, but the annual budgets could reflect the expansion necessary to maintain quality education without rela-

y high increases in the comprehensive fee
In deciding to keep next year’s rate of increase in the comprehensive fee tied to inflation’s rate of increase,
trustees have made a serious flaw. An increase of 4.5 percent will most likely fall short of the rate of inflation.
th the crisis in the Persian Gulf, high oil prices threaten to keep inflation high despite the impending recession.

i, inflation has already reached 6.5 percent, which would suggest that the trustees are really proposing a real
tin comprehensive fees of 2 percent

In the past, increases in the comprehensive fee exceeding the rate of inflation have aided such accomplish-
ments as the building of the Wies Center, the creation of the computer science department, and the retention of
prominent faculty members. Now is no time for stagnation. To maintain and improve on Bucknell’s long standing

tradition of academic excellence will require courageous leadership—perhaps the lions on the finance committee

Bucknell’s in the spotlight

And we’re looking bad...

In the December 3 USA Today article comparing crime statistics from Pennsylvania colleges, Bucknell
eceived the highest crime index rate per capita. This fact sheds a very disturbing light on the reporting of USA
Today as well as on Bucknell’s certain increase in small crime.

It was naive for USA Today to believe it could compare uni
ersities from all over Pennsylvania and develop a just formula by
vhich to create its index. Crime reporting varies extensively
from college to college in the Commonwealth, and it is very
inlikely that any uniformity of reporting could be achieved
Further, most of Bucknell’s so-called frame-of-reference
schools did not participate in the survey. How, then, can we

compare to larger, public universities in far more metropolitan

So why are there so many criminal incidents per
student anyway? Small crime appears to be the answer
Bucknell is plagued with small-time vandals, petty
thieves and ‘wacky funsters’ who prey on the trusting
close-knit community we call home

And thanks to the article in USA Today, Buck
nell is finally going to receive the publicity it deserves.
Until the University finds a way to curb campus crime,
albeit small-time, it will have to live with its reputation.

Speaking of reputation: the Trustees believe that

Bucknell needs to increase its competitiveness.
Surely, this will help.

and let’s just say that right now, I’d even be suspi-
cious of Mother Theresa.

What kind of people are you? What kind of
families do you come from? I falsely assumed that
Bucknell was free of deceitful THIEVES. (Yes,
thieves. I’m hoping that by the end of this letter you’ll
realize what you are, and that you’re no better than
hoodlums on the street. Some of them steal to sur-
vive. Why do you?) As you took our coats you proba-
bly thought, “Oh, well, they’ll never miss it, mummy
and daddy will buy them another one.”

BULLS—T!!! Most people I know struggle to
be here. Ironically, the people who stole my jacket,
and others’, probably need what they took least.
Worst of all, they most likely think nothing of it.

You have no idea just how much you stole
that night. In my case, for instance, you took my ID,
my room key, and most importantly, my car keys.
Unfortunately, my key chain identified the car I
own. Needless to say, I no longer feel safe having
my car on campus. (You'd probably steal my car,
too, just for kicks.) The car is no longer here, but
before I bring it back I will have to replace all the
locks. A six to seven hundred dollar ordeal for me,
just because you were cold. You make me sick!!!

Some of you may wonder why I brought my
coat to a fraternity. Well, when it’s 31 degrees out-
side, I think you’d wear a coat, too. (Except for the
scum that picks one up along the way...) When you
see a sign reading “Coat Room” and walk in to find
hundreds of coats lying around, you assume that all
is safe. I, along with at least seven others were
wrong!!! (Last time I checked the sign “Coat
Room” didn’t translate to, “Come on in and help
yourself!”.)

What more can I say? If this were a bad sec-
tion of a large city I would never have let my jacket
leave my hands. Trusting the apparently secure
Bucknell campus was a mistake.

To the person who has my jacket: If you don’t
have the decency to give it back, at least have the
decency to return my ID and car keys.

Thanks for nothing,

cannot bring myself to re-read Pro-
fessor Travis’ academic discussion

write a rational response to his
elaboration of the pros and cons of

greater costs or losses of one vs.
the other, to resolve the Gulf
Crisis

prices would again rise. It is also
highly doubtful that Iraq and
Kuwait's combined 6% of the total
oil production would have that
much effect on world oil prices
anyway. There are so many wells
off line now in Venezuela and
Saudi Arabia that even if Hussein
caused prices to rise a few dollars
at first, they would quickly adjust
themselves as supply increased
from these wells coming back on
line. In fact, these two countries
along with other OPEC nations
have already raised production
enough to more than offset the
entire output of Kuwait and Iraq.
The war would also raise our
already $225 billion annual deficit,
quite possibly by another $100
billion.

S.T.O.P. explains purpose on campus

To the Editor:

S.T.O.P. (Students and
Teachers Organized for Peace) is a
new organization on campus that
has become very vocal regarding
the use of military force in the Per-
sian Gulf crisis. This brief article is
written for the sole purpose of clari-
fying the many misconceptions on
campus about our group.

S.T.O.P. is against any use of
military action against Iraq and
wants to encourage people to con-
sider non-military solutions to the

conflict. We do not, by any means,
condone the actions of Sadaam
Hussein in invading Kuwait, but we
do not think that the President’s
policy regarding force is justified.
We encourage people to become
educated on the subject from sev-
eral different sources and consider
the results of such a military con-
flict both on us and on the people in
the Persian Gulf. Do we really have
the right to harm a group of inno-
cent people who have been them-
selves pawns of Hussein’s aggres-
sive policy? And why should the

United States provide 81% of the
“United Nations force” when actu-
ally Japan and Europe get more of
their oil from Iraq than we do?
Darren Shaw, in the Novem-
ber 30 edition of The Bucknellian,
remarked on a few points he felt
were wrong with S.T.O.P.’s posi-
tion. We would like to comment on
these because we feel they are
points that the whole campus is
unclear on as well. First, Mr. Shaw
points out that those who have died

Alumna reminds BU of its merits

To Current Bucknellians:

In the height of reforms and
changes, it has been made aware to
the alumni that a very low morale

exists at Bucknell. As I returned to _

New Jersey after Homecoming
weekend, I was reading The Buck-
nellian, and I was shocked to dis-
cover that there is much discontent
and disagreement with administra-
tion’s attempt to reform the social
code. I am not writing this letter to
comment on these social changes, I
am writing this letter to remind you

of what you do have at Bucknell.

I work in a small private
school in which we are greatly
lacking in both facilities and
money. As I arrived on the Buck-
nell campus last Saturday moming,
I was overwhelmed by its beauty
and solitude. I once again realized
how fortunate I was to spend four
years on a campus which offered
the finest library, field house, living
conditions, academic buildings, arts
center and university center. As
construction continues, both the
architecture and beauty are pre-

¢

served while the new buildings
offer more modern and updated
facilities,

While I work in this small,
modest, private school, I remember
and appreciate the magnificent
facilities (not to mention the out-
standing faculty) I had access to at
Bucknell. Not only do I urge you to
appreciate this fine institution, but I
thank you all for hosting a great
Homecoming weekend.

I have heard on occasion that it is
unwise to discuss politics at the dinner
table. At a caf dinner, however, sometimes
the discussion is the only thing that is
heated (and that includes the hot dogs).
One particular evening the meal was
chicken, and the debate focused on the Per-
sian Gulf.

I was talking to an upperclassman,
debating foreign policy and the use of force
in the Gulf. Upon explaining that I believed
force may be necessary in that region, he
informed me that I should become better
educated. This statement stung like a slap
in the face, and to be quite honest, was
rather insulting. I have spent a lot of time

myself, It is difficult to come to the conclu-
sion that people may die in defense of your
belicfs. It is even more difficult to realize
that friends, or even yourself, could be
fighting in a desert thousands of miles
away from home. Yet I have come to my
conclusion, and can live with it.

My adversary apologized and stated
that he was frustrated with people who
express no viewpoint, and was pleased (in
a way) when people respond negatively to
his views, because it demonstrates that they
are thinking of the issue. I agreed that it is
difficult not to become frustrated when
people are ignorant, or just don’t care about
anything not di ) cling themselves.
This person has worked with S.T.O.P. and
continued to explain how difficult it is

when the only way people respond to ideas
is to tear down posters, or knock down
mock graves. One must realize, however,
that people who perpetrate such acts are too
unintelligent or too scared to make a pow-
erful statement. They must rely on childish
methods of reaction, methods that demon-
strate a fear to face controversy.

I, like everyone else, believe my
opinion is correct—for me this basically
defines an opinion. It is when one attempts
to force his opinion on someone else, that
anger or resentment can arise. When I first
became aware of S.T.O.P.’s activities on
campus, I believed they were prophesying
what they believed to be the only accepta-
ble view on the Gulf crisis. I have since
talked with members of S.T.O.P and realize
that they are trying to express a well

rounded view of the situation. Every news
media source is biased in one way or
another. What I was told is that S.T.O.P. is
trying to look at as many sources as possi-
ble, to better educate the campus. If the
group had emphasized this approach from
the beginning, perhaps they could have
avoided some of the unnecessary negative
criticism, and been more successful.
Perhaps not. For no matter how
detailed a report you present, you can not
force people to care. I graduated from a pri-
vate school where the people, both students
and faculty, were very politically aware.
Students worked for Congressmen, pro-
tested, and were generally very well-
informed as to the events unfolding in the
world, Not. everyone was active, but I
would state that ninety percent of the cam-

pus was what I would consider knowledge-
able of current affairs. At Bucknell, there
are people who work for Congressmen,
and protest. 1 would guess, however, that
only about ten percent of the campus is
politically aware. We are on the brink of
war, and people just do not seem that con-
cerned. It seems important enough to me to
shell out thirty-five cents a day to know
what is happening, and what future events
hold for the world. This attitude, or lack of
concern, may be changing, but it practi-
cally required draft cards in mailboxes to
make people aware. Perhaps if the conflict
was over alcohol, and not oil, the Bucknell
Campus would have a greater interest.
After all, at Bucknell, you can probably
survive without oil, but not Budweiser.

The results of the BSG
published in last
weck’s issue of The Bucknellian,
shocked and offended me. Not
only am I upset by the low tum-
out at the elections, | am amazed
by the outcome. With our votes,
we clected at Icast one candidate
who scems to me completcly
unqualified. Her opponent, how-
ever, had a strong platform, valu-
able experience, enthusiasm, and
talent. How could we make such
a mistake? I wonder how those
students who did vote decided
whom they should support.

Of all the BSG officers, I
believe the treasurer holds the
most important position. While
the BSG president must adminis-
trate the functioning of the gov-
emment in general, he needn’t
interact extensively with the
campus. The treasurer however,
as head of the appropriations
committee, must work with
every student group requesting
BSG funding. The treasurer is
responsible for hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars of our money
each year, and must distribute
those funds equitably and
expeditiously.

We have elected, by a 52%
to 48% margin, Vanessa Mayo

failed to elect Dave Fries °93.

elections,

two probably alrcady possessing
substantial nuclear arsenals.

Could oil have anything to do
with Bush’s belligerent stand? If
people believe that the U.S. is
going to war to ensure that the
price of gasoline stays low, then
they have been deceived into think-
ing that we're fighting for a more
noble cause than is actually the
casc. In fact, Bush does not particu-
larly want cheap oil, and further-
more, even if Hussein were left in
control of Kuwait, he would not be
able to push up the price of oil very
far. One picce of the puzzle that is
often ignored is that the U.S. is the
world’s second largest producer of
oil. Our domestic oil companies
(one of which used to be run by our
president) don’t want cheap
imported oil available, because it
depresses the prices they can
charge, and their profits. This is the
reason Bush paid a visit to Saudi
Arabia in 1986 to tcll the King to
cut back production in order to
raise world oil prices. The U.S. has
a long history of taking such steps
to keep the price of oil up, not
down. The other side of the coin is
Husscin’s ability to affect world oil
prices. Even with Kuwait, he still
would control less than 7% of
world oil production, an amount
that is currently being fully offset
by increased production from Saudi
Arabia, Mexico, and elsewhere.

Oil is part of
the picture though.
Exxon, Mobil and
the other major oil
companies earn thou-
sands of millions of
dollars of profits
each year by
shipping oil from the
Persian Gulf area not
just to the United States, but also to
Europe, Japan and other nations
around the world. The reason so
much of this trade is controlled by
U.S. (and British) oil companies is
not attributable to their wizardry at
shipping and marketing oil. Rather,
it is primarily attributable to the
United States’ “special relation-
ship” with the Persian Gulf monar-
chies. The terms of this relauionship
are essentially that the U.S. pro-
vides protection to the monarchies
against both external and internal
enemies; in exchange U.S. oil com-
panies get preferential access to the

BSG vote produ

Why?

region’s oil. In addition, the monar-
chics deposit much of their oil
wealth in U.S. banks, and also buy
large amounts of high tech weap-
onry from U.S. corporations. Just in
the months since the Iraqi invasion,
Saudi Arabia committed itself to
buying 20 thousand million dollars
of additional weaponry from U.S.
firms.

In order to maintain our end
of this relationship
the United States
has to be seen com-
ing to the aid of
Kuwait, one of its
protectorates (also
one in which Brit-
ain shares a signifi-
cant interest), in its
hour of need. This means that it is
important that the U.S. use its mili-
tary power to reinstall the Emir of
Kuwait so that the other monar-
chies will be assured that they can
rely on us. For this reason it would
actually not be to the advantage of
the United States (or at least its oil
companies and military contrac-
tors) if international economic
sanctions were to bring about the
withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait.
Nor would it be seen as advanta-
geous if an Iraqi withdrawal were
to be coupled with the coming to
power of a democratically elected
government in Kuwait, a likely out-
come of a negotiated solution, since
this would mean that the U.S. had
not protected its friend, the Emir.

The special _relationship
between the U.S. and Britain and
the Persian Gulf monarchies also
explains why the U.S. and Britain
are so much more anxious to go to
war than other European nations or
Japan, even though the latter are far
more dependent on Persian Gulf
oil. These nations know that what-
ever the outcome of the current sit-
uation, the countries in the Persian
Gulf still will want to sell them oil,
so they have little reason to be con-
cerned as to whether Saddam Huss-
ein or the Emir of Kuwait is the
person collecting the revenue. No
one should think that these nations
are reluctant to use military force
when their economic interests are
at stake; their major colonial wars
are not that far in the past, and
Africa is still littered with French
and Belgium troops. Their lack of
interest is simply due to the fact

that it’s not their oil companics that
are secing thcir profits threatened.
There is another important
reason why Bush is anxious to usc
force in Iraq: to protect the military
budget. In a period when the U.S.
faces record budget deficits, and it
cannot find the moncy to provide
decent education, health care and
housing for its population, it is very
difficult to justify a 300 thousand

million dollar military budget, par-
ticularly when the U.S. lacks any
real military threat.

It had seemed almost certain
that political pressure would force
very sizable cuts in the military
budget. Such cuts presented a terri
fying prospect to military contrac-
tors, a group that is well repre-
sented in the list of the nation’s
largest corporations. This situation
was completely reversed by the
invasion of Kuwait.

The war dividend was felt
immediately. The Scnate was
debating a measure to cut off fund-
ing for thc  super-sophisticated
Stealth bomber the day of the inva-
sion. The seemed
likely to pass, since the bomber,
which carries a price tag of $800
million per plane, was designed to
evade state of the art Sovict radar
that they were in the process of
developing. In the absence of the
Sovict threat, it seemed ridiculous
to be throwing out such enormous
amounts of moncy on high tech
gadgetry. Nonctheless, in the wake
of the Iraqi invasion, the Senate
voted to continue funding because
of the threat posed by Saddam
Hussein. While the justification for
the spending was absurd (one
expert likened it to using a hand
grenade to kill a mosquito) it kept
the funding flowing. In coming
years we arc likcly to see hundreds
of billions of dollars more of mili-
tary spending justified by similar
illogic.

While there are other reasons
that Bush may want to go to war in
the Gulf (such as keeping his son’s

measure had

involvement in the S&L scandal
out of the headlines, and protecting
Isracl’s military dominance in the
Middle East), they are no more sal-
able to the U.S. public then the
ones discussed above. Conse-
quently, Bush runs around talking
about Husscin’s nuclear threat or
about creating a “new world order”
where national sovercignty and
international law will be respected
by all nations. For
those of us who actu-
ally care about such
things, it is impera-
tive that we work to
stop Bush’s war
Husscin’s invasion is
a serious matter and
should be dealt
with. But there is every reason to
believe that continued economic
sanctions coupled with negotiations
(it seems that the “negotiations”
that Bush has recently proposed
will involve little more than deliv-
ering an ultimatum in person) will
lead to an Iraqi withdrawal and a
real victory for international coop-
eration. It might even help pave the
way for a genuinely new interna-
tional order based on international
law and the peaccful resolution of
conflicts, rather than one based on
the interests of U.S. corporations
and U.S. military power.

According to the constitution
it is necessary for Bush to obtain
congressional approval before ini-
tiating a war in the Persian Gulf.
You can help stop this war by con-
tacting your senators or representa-
tives and urging them to demand
that a declaration of war be debated
by congress (as required by the
constitution), and that they vote
against this declaration.

Like America, WVBU
must censor its music

By John Devecka

Let’s get a few simple points out of the way
first, just so you know where I stand. I am a regis-
tered Republican. I really hate listening to rap
music. I am an atheist. I am unable to understand
homosexuality. Oh yeah, and I am a white, upper-
middle class male. The perfect Bucknellian? Not
really; I actually mean what I say, and I don’t care
about the new Bison.

Ok, now that stated, I am here to attempt to
explain and refute the current rage of intolerance
toward the music industry, and censorship in gen-
eral. As the 1990’s open, we find ourselves under an
increasing wave of moral sclf-rightcousness, wash-
ing over nearly all aspects of our lives, from the sim
ple awareness of which term onc uses for a black
person, regardless of their heritage, to the extreme of
jailing a man for selling a record album. This won-
derful world we are living in is slowly being
engulfed by the overly-vocal minority: the religious
zealot, if you will.

In a time when television is becoming morc
graphic and violent, you cannot buy certain rap
albums in Broward County, Florida or go sce photo-
graphs in Cincinnati, but you can deny a woman her
freedom of choice. I guess I can’t understand the

hyper-religious mind, or where they get the nerve to
rewrite the Constitution and Bill of Rights. As the
music director of WVBU, I suppose I am a bit of a
music zealot myself, so I can’t understand people
who say “‘it’s just music”.

How does this involve you, the simple Buck-
nell student? I’m glad you asked. It is a little known
fact that the music you hear on WVBU, your very
own college station, is censored. You know why this
bugs me so much? Because I’m the one who has the
responsibility of being the censor! I am the one who
chooses what you can listen to. Why? Because the
Federal Communications Commission, the brilliant
government body in charge of radio regulations,
wants it that way. As the music director for the sta-
tion, I am the guy who previews all (more or less) of
the music you hear. I get to write “DO NOT PLAY”
on the CD or LP that says “s—t”. And boy do I revel
in the power of my position...Not! I hatc cringing
when I hear a bad word on the air, almost as much
as I hate calling the DJ and trying to explain that I
am not the pencil-pushing pinhead making the rules,
just the poor sap who has to enforce them.

The other day a new record came in by the
Limbomaniacs, titled “Buttfunkin”. I saw the cvil
lyric warning sticker and sobbed. After finding that
half of the songs contained at Icast onc naughty
word, I made the wretched decision that it wasn’t
worth the risk...No airplay for this new band. A few
days later I had an extended conversation with their
promoter, during which I attempted to explain that I
really hated to do what I felt was necessary. Fortu-
nately, he had experienced this already—the fear has
spread. You may not take the seventy churches in
town seriously but I have to. All it takes is a com-
plaint to the FCC, and the Board of Trustees has
some explaining to do, along with the Board of
WVBU and the DJ who played the record. What a
stupid world.

Lemmy, from the heavy-metal band Motor-
head, recently gave a lecture on censorship at the
College Music Journal Metal Marathon, asking sev-
eral simple questions: “where will it end?” and “why
is it happening?” I can only hope that it will end
soon, but it will take all of us to do something about
eliminating the uptight morality of censorship. Gad,
I sound like some protesting liberal-type! Well, they
can be right, occasionally.

You who sit back and say, “‘it’ll pass”, think
about these tidbits:

« members of the rap act Two Live Crew were
arrested on obscenity charges in Broward County,

Florida after performing for an “adults only”
audicnce.

+ a San Antonio, Texas judge has refused to
dismiss obscenity charges against the owner of
Hog Wild Records for selling a copy of Two Live
Crew’s album “As Nasty As They Wanna Be”.

* Charles Freeman, a record store owner in
Ft. Lauderdale was found guilty of sclling the
same album, denied a retrial, and will be sen-
tenced within the next two wecks.

+ A DJ and store owner in Ottowa, Canada
was arrested for the above excuse and faces up to
two years In prison.

* The band Too Much Joy went to Broward
County to play a concert of Two Live Crew songs
to an over-21 audience; they were arrested.

I am appalled at the mere thought that my
kids (since by then I won’t be willing to risk an
illegal clinic, despite my inability to support a
wife and kid) will be unable to buy an album that
has the word “s—t” on it. Perhaps this is a good
time to mention that many of the “classics” have
such language but have managed to clude the cen-
sors. Pink Floyd’s song “Moncy”, which is on the
most consistent selling album of all time, and gets
massive radio play, contains one “bulls—t”, which
is quite audible.

On another front we have the attacks on
music because of its message. “Satanism”, geez,
I’m going to freak out if I hear this excuse again.
Time to freak out, KNOS-FM in Missouri has
decided that it will play no records from the com-
pany that released the latest albums by King Dia-
mond and Deicide (what a great name!) and has
returned its entire Roadracer Records catalogue to
the label in protest. They state that the label is
“associated with at Ieast two groups that I [ the
general manager of KNOS | know of that espouse
Satanism...We really don’t want to have anything
to do with anybody who is ATTACHED to any-
body who is very outwardly Satanic...we don’t
want to cut anybody off from their belicfs—even
God wouldn’t do that—but we also don’t want to
have anything to do with them.” (CMJ 11/16/90
p4). Hasn’t anyone caught on yet that “Satanism”
is a gimmick that sells records? And how can this
station say that they won’t “cut anybody off from
their belicfs” unless they ask all of their listeners
for an opinion on their censorship?

Let’s talk about record labels. I don’t know
about you, but I’m appalled by the idea of some
group imposing its own moral structure on music
for the general public. Who gets to decide what's
offensive? I cast my vote for Anton LeVay, author
of the Satanic Bible; at least we know where he
stands. A 200-store music chain in the southern
part of this nation has declared that it will not
stock ANY recording that bears a label. Well gee,
that makes sense. Do their customers know about
this? Do they care? I will concede that there are
certain lyrics that offend me—BUT I DON’T
BUY THE D—N ALBUMS! It is absurd to say
that because I hate Muzak that it should be ban-
ished to the depths of Hell from which it sprang—
actually, hey Ict’s call our Congresspeople, and
pressure local church groups and that guy who
always wants my money on TV, yeah, DEATH
TO MUZAK!

What I’m trying to point out is that the men-
tality thet attacks the music is universally screwed
up. Why can’t it be left alone? Oh sure, put ratings
on it—that’ll work. Just look at its success in the
movie industry. Let’s hope that the latest burst of
censorship is as stunning a success as Prohibition.
I, for one, will be in any speakeasy that plays good
tunes. There’s still a pile of records on my desk
that await listening; if anybody has a match I'll
just save mysclf the trouble...

Sexual attitudes offen lead
to assaults on campuses

By Chris O’Sullivan

Your Nov. 12 report on an
allegation of rape at a University of
Rhode Island fraternity house, and
an aftermath that included the sui-
cide of a student who was to mect
the police and discuss what he saw
on the night in question, was dis-
turbing but unsurprising in many
respects. Along with the event,
some of the reported reactions to
the alleged assault are familiar and
troubling.

You raise the unanswerable
question of whether campus scxual
assaults, or merely the reporting of
such assaults, are increasing. If the
rate of assaults is increasing, the
increase must be accounted for by
changes in society or campus life.
If it is primarily the reports that are
increasing, there has been a posi-
tive change in one regard and a
Negative status quo in another.

Because we do not know the
answer, we would do better to look
at the situations in which assaults
occur for the social contexts that
promote them than to speculate
about which changes on campus or
in socicty may be responsible. Yct
both the putative reasons for the
problem and suggested solutions
ignore such information.

For example, one reason you
report as given by university offi-
cials for the supposed increase in
campus rapes is the innovation of
mixed-sex dormitories. My
research shows that incidents like
the one that prompted you report,
involving a
onlookers or participants in a scx-
ual assault, occur most often in all-
male housing

number of men as

This case, occurring
at a fraternity house, is typical in
that regard. Other

cases have

occurred in men’s dormitorics in
violation of visiting hours for
women (for cxample, a recent
alleged rape of a woman visiting
the University of Tennessee men’s
athIctic dorm).

According to your report,
women on campus want morc
safety measures. The sort of pre-
ventive measures this request
seems to imply (better lighting?
locks? security patrols?) could only
be effective against stranger rape,
particularly by non-students. How
can a woman be protected by better
safety measures from sexual assault
by fellow students at a campus
party?

“University officials” also
note that 70% to 80% of discipli-
nary problems are alcohol-related
Surely, there are other constants in
antisocial behavior. It may also be
truc that 70% to 80% of the prob-
lems involve men, occur when stu-
dents are partying and take place at
night. Although it may sccm that
drinking is relatively controllable,
if it is possible that the problems
are gender-related, one should
question how much change climi-
nating alcohol on campus would
produce. In any casc, controlling
drinking on campus may
drive

simply
partics off
underground
Finally, designating as cquiv
alent in their victimization the man
originally accused of rape, one of
the men who allegedly watched the
rape and then killed himsclf, and
the woman who made the rape
charge is also a familiar theme
(although perhaps more justifiable
in this case than most). It is com-
mon for alleged perpetrators of sex-
ual assault to be regarded as vic-
ums within — their

campus and

community,

whether that community is a racial-
ethnic group (as in the New Bcd-
ford, Mass., casc) fans (of the
Washington Capitols, for instance)
or a campus community of
students.
those who
vicw alleged perpetrators as victims
target the woman as the victimizer
(for reporting their behavior), even
when the men admit to some form
of reprehensible group
exploitation

If those men who confess to
such exploitation while denying
criminal culpability are anyone’s
victims, they are victims of their
own group norms. Such groups of
men on campus (and in other scg-
ments of socicty) have sct up the
sexual humiliation of women as a
positive valuc, rewarding it with
approval. In many fratemitics these
values are expressed in a varicty of
practices, from having ugly-date
contests (won by the man who
takes the most unattractive woman
to bed) to arrangements for observ-
ing scxual cncounters, including
peepholes into bedrooms and vide-
Olaping sctups. These settings are
the ones in which the majority of

Robert Cray Band returns for a
Midnight Stroll down blues lane

Renowned blues artist does it
again with his sixth album

By Matthew Wood

Ten years and now six
albums into his career, Robert Cray
has built himself into a quiet force
in music today. With a razor sharp
guitar and a strong, distinct voice,
what could possibly be keeping this
musician from becoming a house-
hold name? One simple reason:
Robert Cray sings the blues.

The blues are not to be con-
fused with Rhythm and Blues, a
sweeping category into which most
of today’s pop music can fit.
Rather, the blues, as Cray himself
says, are about sadness, strife, and
guilt, most commonly associated
with the struggle between the sexes.

tional; they are not about selling 2
million records

Despite this, Cray has man-
aged to build quite a name for him-

perform are convinced of his merit.
Since his 1986 album Strong Per-
suader, he has also caught the eyes
of fellow musicians. Cray has since
worked with Eric Clapton, Tina
Turner, and John Lee Hocker,

among others

Cray’s new album, Midnight
Stroll, is in keeping with his past
efforts, especially his most recent
Don't be Afraid of the Dark, and
Strong Persuader. As usual, he has
enlisted the help of the Memphis
Horns and has also added touring
guitarist Tim Kaihatsu as a full-
fledged member of the band. Those
who know Cray, know that his
albums do not feature two or three
hits followed by filler material.
Instead, his blues rely on making
all songs strong and_ listenable.
Herein lies the strength of his
music.

It is difficult to find albums
that can be played from start to fin-
ish without annoying the listener at
some point. In this way, Cray is a
rare gem and Midnight Stroll fur-
thers this tradition in blues. For this
reason, it’s both difficult and fool-
ish for me to make a haphazard list
of “the album’s best songs,” for
there is no such list. Cray fans have
their own personal favorites, most
likely the songs they find applica-
ble to themselves.

For those of you wondering
if you have heard any of the songs
and not known it, “The Forecast

“Home Alone” is

Greetings, Bucknell! Boy, do
I have a treat for you! Home Alone!
You know, that silly looking film
with the little kid that gets left
home by his parents and has to
defend his house against the attack
of two thieves. Come on, you know
the one...

Gee, the movie sure looked

uses his toys to serve as boobie

Let me let you in on a little
secret..

This movie is horrid. All of
the good, almost-laughable scenes
were shown in the previews. This
movie is little but kiddie fodder
which will have millions of chil-
dren across the country learning
new ways to torment their parents.

The movie is about a small
child who is abandoned and forgot-
ten by his parents when they take a
family trip to Paris. Upon realizing
that he has been left behind, he is at

shallow comedy

first thrilled to have the house to
himself, without a family to bug
him and tell him what to do. How-
ever, eventually he misses his fam-
ily and asks to have them back.
The plot receives its only
laughable twist when two bum-
bling cat burglars attempt to rob his
house. The child realizes that his
house is under attack and assumes
responsibility for defending it.
True, some of his defenses are
clever and deserving of a chuckle
or two. But some of them are just
downright dangerous and absurd.
This film attempted to cash
in on the Problem Child premise
where a pesky little child gets on
his parents nerves. It was a poor
excuse for entertainment: One can
get very sick of “little-kid-getting-
the-better-of-adult” movie themes.
I squirmed through the whole thing
as the little brat not only annoyed
his parents but annoyed ME with
his sickeningly saccharine smile
and “Dennis the Menace” attitude.
The only thing I could think of
throughout this whole, terrible film
was memories of my own little

Surprising week in the sports world

By Mark Griffith and
Eric Smith
Staff Writers

The past few weeks have witnessed an incredible array of bizarre
occurrences in the world of sports. What is to blame for this rash of
unexplainable events? Is it perhaps the excess broccoli on the global
economy? Or maybe an unusual planetary alignment is the culprit.
Whatever the reason, the two gurus of sports, yours truly, will give you
an idea of the ramifications of this positively unnatural phenomenon.

Week 12 of the National Football League begins our chronology.
Up until this week the six division leaders had a combined record of
51-9. But on this strange weekend, all six of the league’s front-runners
lost (an event that had not happened since the AFL-NFL merger).

At this point, it is also fitting to examine where certain teams
stand going into the homestretch of the scason. Who would belicve the
Cleveland Browns would be mathematically climinated in Weck 13?
For that matter, how about the downfall of both the Denver Broncos
and Los Angeles Rams, who own records of 3-9 and 5-7, respectively.
On the other hand, following an upset win on Thanksgiving, the Dallas
Cowboys are in the middle of the wild-card race in the NFC.

In the National Basketball Association, many liked the New
York Knicks to win the Atlantic Division. But we have one thing to
say: “You guys are a half-game ahead of the Nets!” It appears firing
Head Coach Stu Jackson earlier in the weck did not produce a desirable
effect: the Knicks lost again at Madison Square Garden to the lowly
Orlando Magic. Welcome to New York John MacLeod.

In an unprecedented move, the NCAA rescinded an carlicr deci-
sion to ban the Runnin’ Rebels of UNLV from post-scason play this
year. The reversal allows UNLV to defend its national championship
this season, and the Rebels in return will sit out the 1992 tournament
and abstain from appearing on national television during the 91-92
season. And who says the NCAA has changed its moncy-grubbing
ways?

On to the high-priced baseball circuit, where millions of dollars
are being thrown around for...well, we'll Ict you decide. The over-rated
Darryl Strawberry was all smiles when the Los Angeles Dodgers
agreed to pay him over $20 million for five ycars. Other quirky con-
tracts in this year’s free-agent pool include the signing of an 8-18
pitcher, Matt Young, by the Boston Red Sox for almost $3 million/ycar
over the next three years. We hope Matt finds the confines of Fenway
Park a bit more friendly than the Seattle Kingdome. But then again,
with three million dollars under your belt, would you care? With the
incredible rise in mediocre pitcher’s salaries this winter, the Yankees
should not feel badly about paying Pasqual Perez two million dollars
again this year (sure).

Well, to close our semester-long party, we'd like to state that
at this time, four of our six predicted NFL division winners are cur-
rently in first. Also, two of our four National Hockey League projected
front-runners are following suit. See you in ’91!

rest of the league, but we always expect to

with a time of 32.3 seconds, the
third-fastest time in Bucknell
history.

Buckncll also must count on
its newcomers, as many runners are
inexperienced in collegiate competi-
tion. But the fresh faces performed
admirably, as several freshmen
fared well in their first competition.
Jean Simon ‘94
won the 440-yard
run in 52.2 sec-
onds. He was the
New York City
Catholic High
School Champion
in the high hurdles
and 400-meter
intermediate hurdles.

Greg Yochum ‘94 and Martin
Kondrath ‘94 finished first and sec-
ond in the 660-yard run with times
of 1:14.7 and 1:15.7, respectively.

Paul Austin ‘91 continued his
winning ways with a first-place
showing in the 35-pound weight
event with a heave of 16.49 meters.
He won the identical event in last
year’s conference meet. In addition,
he holds the school record for the
hammer throw.

Blaine Fawcett ‘93 won the
triple jump with a leap of 43°3 1/2”.
Norbert Berenyi ‘91, also a ECC
winner last year, won the two-mile
run in 8:58.

Berenyi said, “It’s too early to
know enough about the rest of the
Icaguc, but we always expect to do
well.”

Mark Barolo ’93 also contrib-
uted to the Bison’s success at the
Invitational. He placed second in
both the high hurdles and the 440-
yard run. Last season, Barolo quali-
fied for the IC4A Championships
and the National Junior TAC’s in
the 400-mcter intermediate hurdles.

The women also fared well in
the Bucknell Invitational. The Lady
Bison will attempt to better last
year’s second-place indoor finish in
the ECC as they enter the inaugural
season in the Patriot League. Tricia
Plasko ‘92 commented, “The team
always looks towards conference. It
would be great to take the first con
ference championship in a new
Icague.”

Plasko led the women Satur-
day as she won two events. She was
victorious in the 60-yard dash with
a time of 7.1 seconds, the second-
best time in Bucknell history. She
also finished first in the 220-yard

Staff Writers

After accumulating a record
of 24-9 last season, ice hockey co-
captain Carl Zuckerberg ’91 and
tcammate Pete Troost ‘91
expressed optimism about the
upcoming season. The team will
sport a new look that includes a
more aggressive style of play and
improved basic skills in hopes of
improving on last season’s success.

“This year should be our best .

ever,” said Zuckerburg. He noted
that this year’s team has improved
in many areas from last season.
This includes better defense and
puck sense which, according to
Zuckerman, will result in more
goals being scored than in the past.
He also added that the physical size
of individual players has increased,
an assct that will enable them to
implement a different style of play
than the one used previously.

The Bison hockey team
expects to be more aggressive than
ever before based on their new-
found size advantage. This style of
play will be quite different than last
season’s shoot and skate, finesse

December 7, 1990

A glance back at fall sporis...

By Mark Abrahamsen
Staff Writer

Bucknell athletics experi-
enced a landmark fall season. For
many sports, 1990 served as a year
that will be cherished for quite
some time. The past few months
have been enjoyable to watch, and I
offer the following perspective

Football

The football class of 1991
will go down in school history as
one of the more remarkable senior
classes Bucknell has ever assem-
bled on the Christy
Mathewson-Memoria Stadium
Led by a bevy of veteran talent, the
Bison rolled to a 5-1 start before
concluding their year at 7-4. One
continually had to look back in the
record books during the stellar sea
son, as the Bison were setting team
marks that had not been duplicated
in recent memory. This year’s win-
ning season was the first for Buck-
nell since 1980.
victories marked the first time it
had reached that plateau since
1964, when Bucknell last won the
Lambert Cup.

The two moments that will
forever hold a place in this sports-
writer's memoirs are Bucknell’s
clashes with Colgate and Lehigh
1990 Homecoming provided a per-
fect setting for football, and the bat-
tle between the Bison and Red
Raiders captured the essence of ath-
letic competition. Bucknell built a
sizable first quarter lead, but Col
gate mounted a formidable come-
back in the second half. Late in the
game Bucknell scored to close the
gap to 28-27. Without hesitation,

Cross-country

“The Streak” of Bucknell
cross-country has been well-
documented, as the Bison hadn’t
lost a dual-meet since October 5,
1974, but it ended abruptly Sept. 15
when Bucknell fell to Connecticut.
The formidable run ended at 167
consecutive wins, a mark that can
be attributed to Head Coach An
Gulden’s commitment to excel-
lence, and the year-in, year-out
dedication to the program by Buck-
nell runners. Norbert Berenyi 91
led the Bison to victory in the inau-
gural Patriot League Champion-
ships, and Kelly Marsh °91 paced
the women to a respectable season.

wins with 12. Ken Gulick ’91 once
again filled up opponents’ nets with
instant offense, and four-year letter-
man Terry Pelino 91 concluded a
fine career with a berth in the post-
season playoffs.

Women’s soccer

Congratulations are in order
for the women’s soccer team, which
finally attained varsity status after
years of existence as a club sport at
Bucknell. Though its first season
was a tough struggle, the squad will
likely improve each following year
as interest and recruitment increase.
Head Coach Toby Lovecchio’s win-
ning personality and strong know!-
edge of the game will help the Lady
Bison build themselves into a prom-
inent team in the near future.

Volleyball

First-year Head Coach Cindy
Opalski took over a volleyball pro-
gram that had been in shambles
when she arrived. As_ players
adjusted to a new coach and new
attitude, players’ sentiments have
risen this season to a high level that
should provide for better times
down the road.

Field Hockey

Head Coach Jen Averill’s
field hockey team experienced an
up-and-down season this fall. The
Lady Bison proved that it could
compete with just about every team
it faced, and goaltender Daniclle
Ward °93 did a fabulous job keep-
ing Bucknell in the thick of many
close battles. Freshman sensation
Almira Baldwin °94 led this young
squad, which figures to only get
better with more experience work-
ing together as a cohesive unit.

Women’s tennis

The women’s tennis team
posted another fabulous season for
Head Coach Rose Ewan, compiling
a record of 11-2 this fall behind a

Y good mix of young and old at the

six singles positions. Karen Stagli-
ano ’92 led the Lady Bison to a
third-place finish at the Patriot

Y League Championships, as she

rolled through opponents en route
to the conference title at her #3 sin-
gles position.

Water Polo

Water polo again proved
itself as one of Bucknell’s more
competitive sports, as the team con-
tinually squared off in tournaments
pitting the Bison against the
nation’s best. Head Coach Lynn
Kachmarik’s 15-10 squad attained
a ranking as high as #19 in the
nation, and asserted itself as a dom-
inant team in the East. Polo fin-
ished fourth at the MAC Champi-

was needed, and John Bradbury ’92

others. The team’s highlight of the
season was at the Georgetown Invi
tational on Sept. 21 and 22, as the
Bison averaged a score of 80 as a
team. With more tournaments
under their belts, the team com-
prised mostly of sophomores and
freshmen will look to improve dur-
ing the spring

The fall of 1990 served as a
stepping stone for many athletes
and the last hurrah for many seniors
who etched their final marks on the
playing field. Overall Bucknell’s
athletic department can only be
commended for its efforts and rela
tionships with the students. Not
only have coaches demonstrated
good rapport with the athletes, but
administrators have done a marve-
lous job as well. This fall Bucknell
has witnessed many young men
and women who have exhibited the
capacity for the best of both
worlds...the quintessential student-
athlete.

...d look ahead at winter sports

By Darren Millman
Staff Writer

With the fall season having
given way to the biting cold
weather which typifies this time of
year in central Pennsylvania, the
Bucknell community can now turn
towards the excitement of Bison
winter sports in order to gain a
slight reprieve from the elements.

Men’s basketball

Prior to the beginning of the
season, the prospects for the 1990-
91 men’s basketball campaign
seemed mediocre at best after the
graduation of first team All-ECC
players Greg Leggett (20.2 ppg, 6.1
rpg) and Mike Joseph (18.4 ppg, 6.3
apg). Now seven games into the
young season, however, it appears
Head Coach Charlie Woollum has
done an impressive job restructur-
ing this less experienced group of
players, as substantiated by the
team’s current 5-2 record.

Judging from the capacity
crowds which have already
crammed the stands of Davis Gym,
the word has definitely circulated
around campus that the new-look
Breakin’ Bison are hard-working,
talented and above all,
fun to watch.

Led by the co-captain guard
tandem of Bill Courtney °92 and
Keith Fenton ’91, the Bison thrive
on a quick-paced transition offense,
as well as a hounding pressure
defense. Forward Mike Bright °93
anchors Bucknell’s front court,
while posing an offensive threat
from both inside the paint as well as
beyond the three-point line. Bright
pounded the boards for a team-
leading 7.1 rebounds per game last
season, and his ability to provide
similar numbers this year is essen-
tial to the Bison’s success.

Other key contributor’s to the
team’s early season success include
center Paul Olkowski °93, forward
Pat King ’92, and guard Russell
Peyton °93. Courtney currently
leads the team in scoring with an
average of 21.8 points per game.

Woollum remarked, “I’m
very pleased with the team’s
Progress up to this point. We’ve got
a young team and I’d hope we
would only continue to get better.”

Now in the first scason of
competition in the Patriot League,
Bucknell will have to overcome
two new extremely formidable
obstacles, Fordham and Holy
Cross, in order to challenge for the
title.

The Breakin’ Bison will clash
with St. Francis this Saturday at
7:30 p.m. in Davis Gym.

Women’s basketball

Despite significant experi-
ence and talent, the Lady Bison
basketball squad has failed to per-
form up to its potential thus far this
season as the team is off to a disap-
pointing 0-5 start.

Individually, forward and co-
captain Julie Bachman GR_ has
excepted her role as a team leader,

pacing the Lady Bison with a team-
high 17.0 points per game.

Other bright spots on the
team include guard Joy Sandler
92, who contributed 11 points as
Bucknell narrowly lost to Prince-
ton, 62-59 last Saturday. Sandler is
averaging 14.8 points per game.

Forward/center Kirsten Elli-
son ’92 also performed well against
the Lady Tigers tallying 10 points
and nine rebounds.

A new edition to the Buck-
nell team, guard Kelly Dee 94, has
contributed immediately. Dee has
displayed her competence as both a
playmaker and three-point shooter.

The Lady Bison also depend
upon co-captain Caroline Shanwz
91, Anne McGovem °93, and

Juliet McGee 93.

Ellison assessed the current
situation by stating, “We’re disap-
pointed with the beginning of our
season, but we’ve got to realize that
we have 22 more games left to turn
this around.”

The Lady Bison will travel to
Loyola this Saturday.

The indoor track team will

Men’s swimming and diving

Men’s swimming coach Dick
Russell, has high hopes for his
young yet talented Bison squad.

According to Russell, the
Bison lost 13 players from last sea-
son’s ECC runner-up team to both
graduation and lack of interest. Rus-
sell indicated that in order for the
team to be successful this season, it
is imperative that the freshmen per-
form like seasoned veterans.

Although Bucknell dropped
its first two meets of the season to
UMBC and Colgate, several encour-
aging aspects were evident. Don
Steenson °92 turned in victorious
performances in both meets in the
200 meter backstroke with times
which were impressive for so early
in the season.

Russell noted several swim-
mers whom he expected particularly
good things from including Chad
Farrell *92, Jay Gross '93, Rick
Hutchinson ’91, Marc Murphy ’92,
Kevin Schroth °’92, and John
Ziegler °91

Among the divers, Eric Carr
*93 has performed well, winning the
1-meter event at UMBC.

sell indicated that Dietrich Conze

the intimidating play will enable
them to be more competitive
against schools such as Johns Hop-
kins and Georgetown, two of their
bigger rivals in the league.
According to Zuckerburg,
the team is expecting solid play
from the upperclassmen. This
includes Todd Krutchkoff, Pete
Troost, John Guelcher and Randy
Zultowski. The freshman appear
strong as well, and Zuckerberg pre-
dicts strong results from them as
they work their way through the
Mason-Dixon league.
They will face teams from

The team expressed hopes

The squad hopes to intimidate

fouled twice. She converted three of
four free throws, closing the Lady
Bison deficit to one with 41 seconds
remaining. On Bucknell’s next pos-
session Julie Bachman GR missed a
three-pointer, forcing the Lady
Bison to foul as precious seconds
dwindled away.

Shantz fouled Princeton guard
Leah Spraragen, who hit both free
throws, upping the Lady Tigers’
lead to 62-59 with 0:12 remaining.
Bucknell was unable to get a good
final shot off, as Bachman’s long
attempt fell short.

“Princeton had a good passing
team,” said Dee. “They worked the
ball around well to get the good
shot.”

Bucknell will hope to break
into the win column this weekend,
as the Lady Bison travel to Loyola
tomorrow in search of their first vic-
tory. Bucknell will entertain Young-
stown State this Tuesday at 7 p.m.

Wake Forest in the Tobacco Road

Breakin’ Bison climb to 5-2 mark

Men‘s hoops tops Yale, Lycoming; falls to Fairfield

By Tommy Abel
Staff Writer

The Breakin’ Bison improved
their record to an impressive 5-2 as
they trounced Lycoming (2-6) 97-
49 Wednesday night. This win gave
Bucknell a 13-0 sweep in the now
concluded series between these two
teams.

This was a game which fea-
tured no outstanding individual per-
formances, but rather a fantastic

team effort. Three Bison broke into
double figures in scoring, Mike
Bright ’93 with 11 points, Keith
Fenton °91, 11 points, and Pat King
*92, 10 points, while all 15 Bison
broke double figures in minutes
played

Head Coach Charlic
lum commented,

have by far. I was pleased with the
way all the players
performed.”

Women’s hoops stumbles fo 0-5

Lady Bison look to break into win column tomorrow at Loyola

By Dave Riggs and
Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The Bucknell women’s bas-
ketball team, beaten twice this past
week, will be searching for its first
victory of the season when it
squares off against Loyola, (Md.)
tomorrow in Baltimore. Princeton
traveled to Davis Gym last Satur-
day and held off a late rally by
Bucknell to win 62-59, and St.
Francis used a balanced attack to
stop the visiting Lady Bison 89-83
on Tuesday. The losses drop Buck-
nell’s record to 0-5 this season, as
the Lady Bison continue to struggle
in close games.

From the opening tip St.
Francis took it to the Lady Bison, as
the hosts jumped out to an 11-4
lead behind two three-point ficld
goals from sharp-shooting guard
Maureen Logan. Bucknell’s Kelly
Dee ‘94 then decided to show that
she can deliver the long-range
bomb as well, nailing 3  three-
pointers to knot the score at 17-17
with 13 minutes remaining in the
half. The two teams traded buckets
for a while, and then St. Francis
went on an 8-0 run, sparked by its
center Vesna Drazetic, who tallied
six points during the flurry. Buck-
nell was unable to respond with a
run of its own, as the Lady Bison
matched baskets with St. Francis
for the rest of the half. Bucknell
strolled to the locker room with a
seven point deficit, 44-37.

The first five minutes of the
second half have proven to be a piv-
otal point all season for the Lady
Bison, as they have either mounted
‘strong comebacks or blown a big
lead. This time neither happened, as

the opening minutes were fruitless
for both squads, with Bucknell only
able to chop one point off St. Fran-
cis’ halftime lead, making the score
53-47. The two teams continued to
trade baskets throughout the
remainder of the game, as Bucknell
was only able to cut the Icad to four
at 77-73 with 3:27 left to play, with
St. Francis sitting on top in the end
89-83. Once again Dee played
strong for the Lady Bison, leading
all scorers with 24 points. The
Bucknell bench responded to Head
Coach Lori Howard's call, as Julict
McGee '93 netted 10 points, while
Heather Ross ‘94 and Anne
McGovern ‘93 each had six off the
pine. St. Francis mounted a bal-
anced attack, as it had six players
scoring eight points or more.

“We couldn’t get any
momentum built up,” said Dee. “It
wasn’t one person in particular who
killed us, I think it was more
because we had trouble getting
back on defense off the breaks.”

It was a different story when
Bucknell took on Princeton in
Davis Gym last Saturday. Princeton
came out firing with its big scorer,
Julie Brackenridge, out on the
perimeter in the carly going. She
canned 11 points in the first seven
minutes, helping Princeton open up
a 19-8 lead. After a Bucknell time-
out, the Lady Tigers slowed the
tempo and showed great patience
against the Lady Bison zone. The
tactic worked, allowing Princeton
to build a 34-15 advantage with
6:10 left in the half. Bucknell then
caught fire as reserve Monica Naw-
arskas 94 put in four points, and
center Kirsten Ellison ’92 put in
five of her own to cut the gap to
nine at 37-28, to end the half with a

Bucknell was able to hold
Lycoming to only 12 points while
adding 48 of its own in the first
half. The second half continued
much the same as Lycoming was
never able to get on track, shooting
less than 30% from the ficld.

The game served as a break
for the Bison and as stated by
Woollum, an excellent showcase of
the younger, unseen talent on the
team. Among the new contributors
were Matt Clark ’93 six points (2-5
from three-point land), Ray Brown
04 four points, one dunk, and
Chris Simpson ’94 six points and
three assists.

On Monday, a_beleagured
Bucknell team took on a pumped-
up Fairficld University squad.
From the opening tap the Stags
took control holding the Bison to
46% shooting and outscoring them
47-37 in the first half.

Positive spots for Bucknell
were Bill Courtney ’92 and Bright,
who scored 14 and 10 points in the
first period, respectively. Unfortu-
nately for the Bison the second half
did not prove much better than the
first.

Bucknell shot 26% from the
floor and was outscored by 17
points. Co-captain Courtney
explained the outcome of the game
stating,“I think it was just a case of
us running out of gas.”

Woollum agreed with Court-
ney’s assessment stating, “We had
played six of the hardest games in a
row we’ve ever played, and I think
it finally wore us down.”

On Saturday the Bison faced
Yale (1-3), who was coming off a
near upset of #15 UCONN. The
Bulldogs were the pre-season pick
to win the Ivy League, but that did
not mean much when they played
in front of a over-capacity Davis
Gym crowd.

The Breakin’ Bisons started
the game fast and furious going on
an cight minutc, 12-0 run. When
the Bulldogs were finally able to
pull it together it was too late

Mike Bright °93 leaps skyward during the Bison’s 72-63 victory over Yale last Saturday. Bright tallied 18

ECC All-Rookie campaign as a major contributor to Bucknell.

13-3 Lady Bison run.

Bucknell came out of the
gates strong for the second half,
something it has had trouble doing
in earlier games. Guards Caroline
Shantz ’91 and Joy Sandler *92
combined for eight points early to
bring Bucknell within five of the
Lady Tigers at 47-42 with 15 min-
utes remaining. Once again Brack-
enridge was the answer for Prince-

ton, scoring the next six points
while holding the Lady Bison
defense in check. Bucknell
remained six to eight points down
until they were able to cut the mar-
gin to four off a McGovern steal
and basket’ with 3:16 left in
regulation.

Bucknell then pounded the

were able to hold strong, never
relinquishing their lead, while the
tough Yale team fought back.

According to Courtney, “A
couple of times they got close but
we pulled it out with tough defense
like a team.”

Courtney was instrumental
in the team’s impressive victory,
netting 18 second half points to
finish with a team high 21. Bright
and Fenton followed with 20 and
17 points, respectively.

“We were in command pretty
much from start to finish,”
explaincd Woollum. “It was a good
defensive effort.”

The Bison will rap up their
difficult pre-winter break schedule

Grapplers capture
second at JMU

Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

The Bucknell wrestling team
finished second this past weekend
in the James Madison Invitational
tournament. The tournament. was
encouraging in that it produced two
first-place and three second-place
individual finishes.

The excellent individual per-
formances by the Bison, however,
were undermined by their disap-
pointing finish behind Bloomsburg,
one of their main grappling rivals.

The Bison went into the tour-
nament coming off a second-place
finish to Bloomsburg in the
Huskies own invitational tourna-
ment. As a result, Bucknell worked
hard in hopes of redeeming itself in
the second confrontation with
Bloomsburg.

Individually, co-captains
Tom Marchetti ’91 (167 Ibs.) and
Bryan Bums 91 (190 Ibs.) both
won their weight classes. Marchetti
beat Tom Socker of Bloomsburg,
while Burns defeated Brad Web-
ber, also of Bloomsburg, 11-3.

Additionally, Marchetti was
given the Outstanding Wrestling
Award at the end of the tourna-
ment. Ken Herceg ’92 (177 lbs.),
Chris Doukas 91 (134 Ibs.), and
Mike Van Doren 92 (142 Ibs.) all
finished second in the tourney.

While Marchetti and Burns
are currently ranked seventh and

eleventh in the nation for their
respective weight classes, those
standings could soon improve with
the recent tournament. Bums
defeated Syracuse’s Mark Kerr who
is currently ranked eighth.

Coach Ferraro was pleased
with the Bison performance at
JMU. While he felt that there were
a few inconsistent matches, the
team as a whole put in a good
effort.

According to Burns, the team
had a lot to be happy about in terms
of effort and results. “We worked
hard,” he said. “Of course we
would have liked to have beaten
Bloomsburg.” He added, though,
that “Bloomsburg is not a better
The Bison have a prolonged
break until Jan. 11, when they face
Millersville at home. As a result,
the practice schedule has relaxed,
with the team only wrestling on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays.

Following a meet against
N.C. State on Jan. 12, the team will
prepare for its trip to California on
Jan. 17.

The Bison wrestlers are hop-
ing that their success in the last two
tournaments will give them the con-
fidence to perform well in the next
phase of the season.

Burns noted, “We're a good
team with a lot of talent. Right now
we could compete with any team.”

Baghdad Radio announces
lraqi withdrawal from Kuwait

U.S. awaits concrete action; Iraqis rejoice in streets

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

Baghdad Radio announced
this morning that “the
Revolutionary Command Council
has decided to accept United
Nations Resolution 660, including
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.”
While the statement, which could
signal the beginning of the end of
the Gulf war, pledged the
“immediate and total cessation of
all land, ground and sea action”
against the allied forces, it also
called for the withdrawal of allied
forces from Saudi Arabia, as well
as an Israeli pullout from the West
Bank and a possible Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon; it was
unclear immediately whether these
are hard conditions linked to the
withdrawal.

President George Bush,
however, rejected the Iraqi overture,
which he called “‘a cruel hoax.” At
the daily U. S. military briefing in
Riyadh, Brigadier General Richard

Neal announced, “Our mission
remains the same, and our forces will
continue to execute that mission.”
The radio announcement was
met by relief and jubilation in
Baghdad, as residents took to the
streets and fired their weapons into
the air in celebration. Allied forces,
however, are more skeptical, and
refuse to call a halt to the war until
Iraqi troops begin to move. One
Pentagon official quoted on the Cable
News Network said he felt “relief,
not surprise, [but] let’s wait and see.”
The first official reaction to the
announcement in Washington came
from White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater, who read a
statement this morning which said
that while officials are still examining
the proposal, “it clearly contains
conditions for Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait. Promises alone are not
significant... [it] must be
accompanied by concrete actions on
the ground.” Bush was expected to
stick to his planned schedule, visiting
a Patriot missile factory in

Massachusetts before traveling to
Kennebunkport for the weekend.

The announcement, which
came over the air at 6:16 a.m. EST,
sent Washington scrambling to
interpretand analyze the statement,
although the initial military reaction
could be described as hopeful
skepticism. Within an hour of the
statement a British military
spokesman announced that ““amere
verbal indication...would not be
cause for stopping military
operations.” United States military
officials in Saudi Arabia said that
“nothing is changed until we hear
from the commander-in-chief.”
Reports from CNN correspondent
Peter Arnett in Baghdad noted that
even as citizens rejoiced in
Baghdad, air raid sirens were
sounded at about 7 a.m. EST. A
pentagon official, estimating that
30 percent of Iraq’s military
capability has been destroyed in
the month-long war, commented,
“If [Saddam Hussein] is serious,
he did this at the point of a gun.”

SPE fire causes $263,000
damage, destroys wing

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

Students retumed to the neatly
repaired Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
house following the Dec. 13 fire
which caused $263,000 damage. All
24 residents have returned to the
house, although four students whose
rooms were destroyed are living with
friends until contractors complete
repairs. The chapter’s insurance
covered approximately 80 percent
of the loss but was not sufficient to
cover the total cost of repairs due to
depreciation.

By the start of the spring
semester, the house was essentially
ready for its occupants. “All the
students were able to move into the
house and into their rooms, except, I
think, four students who lived on the
first floor and those four weren’t
able to do so because the tile had not
been laid in their rooms,” said Gerry
Commerford, assistant dean for
housing.

Several students who live
upstairs have not been able to return
to their rooms. The still unoccupied
rooms need only minor repairs. The
installation of built-in closets,
shelves, and desks is not complete.
Also, contractors still have to paint
the rooms. Room repairs should be
complete within three weeks.

In the meantime, the students
forced out of these rooms are living
in other rooms within the house.
Students moved intorooms occupied
by only one fraternity member. “In
no case have we overcrowded any of
the rooms,” said Jim Orbison, SPE’s
faculty adviser and associate
professor of civil engineering.

Contractors have made final
repairs to the living room, which

Jenks proposes severing
of university ties to ROTC

Faculty requests public fora, delays vote on motion

By Mark Leister
Staff Writer

Monday’s faculty meeting
ended with the postponement of a
motion to sever ties with the
University’s Army Reserve Officer
Training Corps (ROTC) program.
The delay hinged on the faculty’s
majority opinion that public fora
should be conducted before any final
policy decisions are made.

George Jenks, collection
development librarian and author of
the motion, based his proposal on
two primary principles. First, the
University’s non-discriminatory
policy conflicts with the U.S.
military’s discrimination on gender
and sexual orientation; second, the
mission of the armed forces is “to kill
other human beings and destroy
property” — principles often
interpreted as incongruent with the
University’s mission. For these
reasons, Jenks has proposed the
complete severing of ties with the
Army ROTC program as soon as
legally possible.

Jenks’ motion also concerns
the University’s monetary link to the
ROTC program. Jenks explained that

after ROTC” on financial grounds.
The University, Jenks believes,
demonstrates its constant willingness
to accept “tainted money” with no
regard to “what strings are attached.”

These ‘strings’ describe the
contracts into which ROTC cadets
must enter in order to receive

scholarship money. In return for a
four-year commitmentto serve in the

Weddle, Greaves step down
from administrative positions

By Mark Abrahamsen and
Darren Millman
Staff Writers

Two Bucknell administrators,
Associate Vice President for Student
Life Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle and
Vice President for Academic Services
and Planning Thomas Greaves, have
announced their intentions to pursue
other career interests after this
semester.

Weddle

Weddle, currently in her fifth
year at Bucknell, described her
decision to leave as “the chance to
spread my wings outside the realms
of higher education.”

Over the last two semesters, a
University commitice thoroughly has
evaluated Weddle’s performance.
The committee issued its final report
to President Sojka last summer.

In addition to members from
the student body, faculty, and
administration, the evaluation
committee included administrators
at frame-of-reference schools who
had experience in positions like
Weddle’s.

Although Weddle explained
that she has not seen all of the
evaluation reports, she stated that the
process took several months longer
than expected.

When asked if the evaluation
process affected her decision to
change careers, Weddle responded,
“My own agenda changed during the
time period of the evaluation. The
predominant impact was what is
going to be the best foundation for a
long-term relationship between my
husband and myself, and where we
can each have career opportunities.”

Weddle is planning to relocate
in North Carolina, and she labels the
move a “joint enterprise” with her
husband. She finds her options
limitless, but hints that human
resources management could be part
of her future.

“I’ve really wanted to do
consulting, and working with
organizations,” commented Weddle.
While she has accepted a nomination
to compete for the vice presidency at
another prestigious university, no
final decision has been made. She
has also entertained the thought of

Fire
From page 1

The fire completely destroyed
four rooms, according to Orbison.
Six windows had to be replaced and
“the rest of the structure suffered
water and smoke damage,” said
Orbison.

Because SPE is a privately
owned fraternity, the university did
not pay for repairs. “We have
insurance on the structure and on the
chaptercontents,” said Orbison. Due
to depreciation, the insurance will
not cover the entire bill for repairs.

The fraternity will need a loan
to cover 20 percent of the repair
costs. Orbison said he has had a
“verbal agreement” from the national
chapter to supply the balance in the
form of a loan. To pay off the loan,
SPE may have to consider
remortgaging its house.

Individuals in the upstairs
rooms, hardest hit by the fire, lost all
of their personal belongings.
According to John Ambrose 93, who
occupied the room where the fire
originated, seven students “lost
everything” in the fire.

“Hopefully home owners
insurance will cover it,” Ambrose
said.

The William Cameron Engine
Company has distributed copies of
the fire report to students planning to
claim damages incurred in the fire.
“Most of the brothers of SPE took
copies of that report and used it to fill
claims for their home owners
insurance,” said Safety Manager Jim
McCormick. College students are
often covered by their parents’ home

owners insurance.

Although the construction
company worked through January,
when most students left campus, the
fire caused initial problems which
had to be dealt with during finals
week. Following the fire the
University provided members of SPE
with alternative housing across
campus and meals in the cafeteria.

Fire engines arrived at the scene
at 8:35 a.m. on December 13 after “a
smoke detector in the hallway of SPE
wasactivated” and alerted dispatchers
at the »security office, said
McCormick.

Upon his arrival at
approximately 8:30 Steve Chene,
William Cameron assistant fire chief
and Weis Center technical director,
called for more trucks to fight the
blaze which had already broken
through the roof. In total, eight area
fire companies responded to the three
alarm fire.

The fire, which destroyed many
of the upstairs fraternity rooms, began
as a smoldering mattress. The fire
report attributed the start to a fallen
candle.

Tim Peterson, one of several
residents who smelled smoke an hour
before the arrival of fire engines,
discovered the smoldering mattress
and attempted to extinguish it. “I
went upstairs and the whole hallway

was just filled with smoke, and I
went up in the loft where the mattress
was and it wasn’t a fire,” said
Peterson.

Peterson poured water on the
mattress and, assuming the fire to be
out, left for swim practice. “I poured
a pitcher of water over it and just
thought it would be fine because all
the embers were out and any kind of
sparks were out,” he said.

According to one firefighter
on the scene, a mattress can smolder
for a long time before actually
igniting. “You can throw anemberin
a mattress. It'll smolder for hours
before it ignites. While it’s
smoldering it won’t produce any
smoke,” he said.

As soon as the fire was
discovered, security evacuated the
building. Residential Life staff
members conducted a head count in
which all but one individual was
immediately accounted for; they soon
learnea, however, that the one
unaccounted for student had left
campus.

The fire destroyed the contents
of five rooms on the second floor of
the house and three other rooms
suffered major smoke damage.

the form of water damage.

The section in which the fire
began is a relatively new addition to
the house, built about fifteen years
ago. A fire wall, originally the outer
wall of the house, still separates the
addition from the main part of the
house.

“None of us knew that brick
wall was up there ... so everyone was
concerned that the fire was going to
spread from that portion of the
building into the center part and work
its way over. However, that wall, the
brick wall, is the thing that stopped
the fire from spreading,” said
McCormick.

Had it not been for the wall,
damage would likely have been far
more extensive, according to
McCormick.

The fact that SPE is not a
university owned fraternity did not
keep faculty from assisting students
living in the house.

“The connecting thread is
they’re our students, regardless of
where they live, they’re our students
so we think of our obligation as one
to people, to students, and not to
where they live,” said Dean of
Students, John Dunlop.

Dunlop also pointed out that

“the total financial aid picture,” since
ROTC’s removal would represent a

Most students driven out of the
SPE house resided for the rest of the
fall term with friends off campus.
Those who had no place to stay lived

The University provided
students with meals during the final

the bookstore gave members of SPE

The deans of both colleges
worked with students to deal with
problems arising because students’
books bummed in the fire.

the decision to suspend action on the
motion until public fora can be held.
Becker stated that he hopes for a
“cross-fertilization” of ideas with
“thoughtful discussion of the
perspectives of the faculty” as well
as of “the legal implications” of the
motion.

A decision to remove
Bucknell’s Army ROTC program
would have both local and national
ramifications. Established in 1951
with the charge of educating and
training future military leaders,
Bucknell’s program has achieved
prominence as the “east coast’s

the motion can be raised for a final
vote at the March 4 faculty meeting.

An overwhelming majority of Bucknell students, 86.1 percent, currently support President Bush’s
decision to use force against Iraq according to a survey conducted by The Bucknellian last weck. However,
84.8 percent of students surveyed believe the war will extend beyond two months. 65.8 percent of students
currently support Bush’s decision despite the fact that they also expect the war to last longer than two months.

A mere 6.3 percent of the students contacted stated that they had participated as a member of an
organized group in cither protesting or supporting the war; 5.1 percent had been involved in activities in
support of the war while only 1.3 percent had protested against it.

An even larger majority, 94.9 percent, opposed the elimination of the ROTC program at Bucknell. Of
those polled, 2.5 percent were ROTC members. Of the 74 non-ROTC members who responded to the

question, only 1.4 percent favored the elimination of the ROTC program.

Students undaunted by war
continue to study overseas

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

Despite the war in the Persian
Gulf and the increased fears of
terrorism both at home and abroad,
Bucknell students studying abroad
have been little-affected, according
to Barbara Rowe, director of off-
campus studies.

She said that only four of the
103 Bucknell students scheduled to
go abroad, or four percent, chose to
drop out following the outbreak of
war. Some January programs,
however, were affected by the
conflict.

Rowe said that the crisis did
notcatch her office off guard because
off-campus studies departments
across the U.S. have been “talking
about how to handle the situation
since carly November, [and] every
program has contingency plans in
place.” In addition, she said “most
programs have beefed up security,”
and have included lessons to students
on how to behave prudently, by
avoiding traveling alone or standing
out as an American.

There have been isolated
incidents of threats to programs,

specifically in Florence, Italy, but
Rowe said that “many [programs]
have had [only] minimal withdraws.”

Rowe said that applications for
off-campus studies constituted “one
of our highestsemesters,” noting that
those applications were duc before
the Gulf crisis began. She added,
“most students are going ahcad as
planned” with applications for the
fall semester. Although some students
have been nervousabout making such
plans, Rowe summarized, “I
personally would encourage students
to go ahead; we should all have a
wait-and see-attitude.”

While traditional off-campus
studies have experienced only minor
disruptions, tensions from the Persian
Gulf war caused the students in one
January program to cut short their
stay in Europe.

The eleven students in the
“Exploring the Alps” program in
Austria, who were accompanied by
Tom Travis, professor of political
science, had the option of returning
on Jan. 20 or traveling for a week
before returning on the 27th.
According to Stephanie Cohen '92,
one of the students on the trip, the
entire party chose to rectum early

because they “heard it was difficult
to cross borders,” rendering their
travel plans more difficult. She said
anti-American feelings “were not too
much of a threat in the ski towns.”

But the group did encounter
anti-war protestors in Munich. “We
didn’t like to be out in public a lot,”
she said. Cohen concluded that the
increased tensions made the journey
“kind of scary but really exciting to
be there at the same time.”

Travis said that the class had
discussed contingency plans carlicr
in the month, and following the
fifteenth Travis said that he
“suggested gencrally that they might
want to think about coming home,”
but that he “didn’t push” the issue.
However, after many parents
contacted the students and Travis
spoke to Barbara Shailor, January
program coordinator, he advised
students to leave, telling them, “Ina
state of uncertainty it was best to be
prudent.”

Both Cohen and Travis said
that there were many cancellations
on their retum flight to the U.S., as
many Europeans put off plans to
travel here following the beginning
of the war.

from student mail room

By Steve Hoerter
Staff Writer

Approximately 100 compact
discs and an undetermined number
of cassette tapes were stolen from the
Student Mail Room in the Langone
Center early this month in what, Jim
Muchler, director of administrative
services, has termed an “unfortunate
incident.”

According to reports issued by
the Department of Security and
Safety, employees reported the discs
and tapes missing at 1 1 a.m. February
4. Following a search of the area, by
employees and officers from Security
and Safety, four empty cardboard
boxes, which the discs and tapes were
reportedly stored in, were discovered
stashed under a counter in the
mailroom.

East Buffalo Township Police
were called to the scene and the
United States Postmaster in
Lewisburg was notified of the
incident.

According to Vincent
DeCerchio, director of security and
safety, “The incident’s under

investigation at this time, we believe
it’s an internal theft and we have
some leads.” DeCerchio said that the
area “has been secured. Locks have
been rekeyed and an alarm system
has been installed to prevent any
future attempted theft from the
mailroom.” He added that arca
merchants, including the University
Bookstore, “have been notificd of
the thefts and have been advised to be
on the lookout” for anyone attempting
to sell or return the stolen discs and
tapes.

Employees in the mailroom
refused to comment on the incident,
and directed all questions to Muchler,
who is in charge of student mail
services.

Amid speculation that U.S.
postal inspectors would be involved
in the investigation, Muchler, in an
interview Wednesday, stated that
“\.the student mailroom is the
equivalentof any institution's central
mailroom.” He added, “It is not a
chartered post office like the one
located in Marts Hall,” therefore it
does not fall under federal
jurisdiction.

Severe windchills
to strike tomorrow

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

Temperatures are scheduled to
drop into single digits tonight and
rise only into the teens tomorrow,
accompanied by high winds, a
combination which can cause a
significant danger of frostbite on skin
exposed to the clements for only a
short time.

According toOwen Anderson,
professor of physics, the wind chill
factor, an index which measures the
temperature felt on the skin, could be
between 15 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit
below zero tomorrow, duc to winds
between twenty and thirty miles per
hour.

He said that the wind chill
overnight tonight could reach as low
as 40 degrees below zero. Anderson
explained that exposed flesh may
freeze within one minute in wind
chills below minus 25.

Dr. J. Preston Hoyle, director
of medical services, explained that
“a cold injury is much like a burn,”
and stressed the importance of “being
very careful to cover exposed skin
and take the proper steps” if frostbite
occurs. In such cases, Hoyle
recommends “slow, gentle warming,
something which encourages
circulation, but not rapid heat,” as
well as seeking prompt medical
attention.

Hoyle also explained that
alcohol consumption can cause
greater risk of a cold injury, since “it
dilates blood vessels and one might
feel very warm—that’'sa false thing.”
Since the intoxicated person “spends
body heat very quickly, when that
stage ends you’ re more likely to have
a cold injury.” He also noted the
increased risk because the intoxicated
person may not be aware of the
potential danger or the precautions
which should be taken.

Approximately 39 students are
believed to be victims of the theft.
According to Muchler, “We have 39
names, two of those share [mail]
boxes — we don’t know for certain
which of the 4 students would have
been the recciver’s [of the discs or
tapes].” He added that the list is
“rough” and not wholly accurate.

Muchler said that the
University “would like to offer any
assistance to the students that we
can; as much help as we can provide
them to resolve the issue as quickly
as possible.”

He said that the compact disc
companies involved were being
contacted in the hope that they might
be able to more specifically identify
the victims of the theft.

Addressing the changes in
mailroom procedure, Muchler said,
“We don’t want to create a system of
hassle. The policies we’ve invoked
asa result, itis hoped, will not hamper
the service of the mailroom. Students
certainly don’t need the hassle;
hopefully with the measures we’ve
taken, we won’t see a repeat of the
incident.”

U.S. bomb hits
lraqi civilians

Iraq has claimed that two
bombs dropped Wednesday from an
American Stealth bomber landed ina
reinforced concrete building housing
hundreds of Iraqi civilians. Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz claimed 400
civilians died in the bombing. Later
reports, however, indicated that the
bombing killed as few as 65 civilians.

American officials said they
targeted the structure, because of
evidence that it had been converted
into a military command and control
center. Iraq claims the installation
had been a longtime civilian air raid
shelter. Officials also said that Iraq
may have purposely allowed civilians
to use the building knowing that it
was a likely target for U.S. bombing.

In a tclevised appearance,
White House Spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Saddam Hussein “time
and again, has showed a willingness
to sacrifice civilian lives and property
that further his war aims.”

The attack has invoked
considerable controversy within the
Bush Administration, which insisted
from the start of the war on accurately
bombing only military targets. Bush
has expressed a wish to spare civilian
lives.

The possible 400 civilian
deaths would represent the largest
single day casualty list since Iraq’s
invasion of Kuwait on August 2.
Baghdad officials have reported the
deaths of 600 civilians in the four

Chinese issue
harsh sentence

Two democracy advocates
arrested during the Tiananmen
protests received 13-year prison
sentences by a Chinese court. The
sentences, which came Tuesday, are
the longest of any announced in
connection to the demonstrations of
April, May, and June 1989.

The trials seemed to be an
attempt by the government to place
responsibility for the entire uprising
on only two men, Wang Juntao and
Chen Ziming.

The official New China News
Agency broadcast that the two men
“wantonly incited some persons to
subvert people’s government and
socialist system, gathered together
some illegal organizations in Beijing
and conducted a series of activities to
subvert the people’s government.”

Despite China’s apparent
attempt to use Wang and Chen as a
waming to Chinese people, diplomats
said the nation may view the men as
national heroes. One Western
diplomat said it was “an absurdity”
that the Chinese government would
attempt to place the entire burden of
the Tiananmen incident of two
individuals.

Japan reports
nuclear mishap

The company which operates
the Minami nuclear power plant in
Japan revised its accounts of a major
weekend accident in which “a small
amount” of radiation escaped into
the atmosphere. The company now
admits that workers waited 50 min-
utes before shutting down the plant.

The delays in plant shut down
occurred because workers belicved
that the gauge showing increased
radioactivity in a cooling chamber
was registering false readings.

Not long after the workers did
begin reducing power, anemergency
shutdown system prevented a nuclear
meltdown by injecting water into the
core of the reactor.

Japanese officials had said
earlicr that plant operators acted
withouthesitation and that no nuclear
fuel escaped. Reversal of the
statement may be an embarrassment
to the government, which has plans
to double its nuclear power capacity.

Officials claimed a breach in
tubes carrying water from the nuclear
core was the probable cause of the
accident. Radioactive water leaked
during the accident contaminating
the water in the steam generator.

Brown expels
student

Brown University has expelled
a student who violated an anti-
harrassment rule by shouting racial
epithets. The expulsion of Douglas
Hann is the first of its kind at Brown,
and it is possibly the first such
expulsion in the nation.

The university’s Under-
graduate Disciplinary Council found
Hann, a junior, to have violated a
tuling put into effect in the fall of
1989. Hann’s “hate crime” was
shouting anti-black, anti-Semitic, and
anti-homosexual slurs ina courtyard.
He was also under the influence of
alcohol at the time. The incident was
Hann’s second violation including
racial epithets.

on Education nor the American Civil

USAir lays off
employees

USAir, Inc. announced on
Monday its plans to eliminate 3585
employees from its workforce, a
decrease of approximately six
percent. The cuts, which include the
dismissal of 660 pilots, are the
airline’s attempts to deal with high
fucl prices and a slumping travel
industry.

In addition the airline, one of
the largest major carriers not planning
to seck bankruptcy protection, will
reduce its number of flights each day
by 286 to 2,626. The east coast will
be primarily affected, though flights
will be cut in the west as well.

British Airways also
announced plans to eliminate
employees. A slow travel business
caused by the war in the gulf forced
British Airways to cut its workforce
by 8.8 percent, a lay-off of 4600
employees. An additional 3.5 percent
of its employees at half pay will lose
their jobs.

Many of the top airlines have
had to take drastic measures in an
attempt to survive the lag in travel
business. Last week Pan American
World Airways, operating under
Chapter 1 1 of the Federal Bankruptcy

Code, revealed its intentions toreduce
its workforce by 15 percent.

British Airways, hoping to
promote international travel,
announced a 33 percent drop in the
costof around trip ticket between the
United States and Britain.

Wall St. rallies in
wake of war

A rally on Wall Street, the
biggest since Iraq’s invasion of
Kuwait, took place early this week.
Trading was heavy and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average reached its high
point for the year, leaping 71.54
points, or 2.5 percent to 2,902.23.

Since the start of the war on
Jan. 17, the Dow has risen over 15
percent. Stock prices began rising in
the early days of fighting and never
receded, as in the days leading up to
war. A sputtering economy, inflated
oil prices, and the possibility of war
had, for a time, caused stock prices to
drop, but it now appears they are on
the rebound.

By the eve of the war, the Dow,
had dropped to2508.91. By Monday,
the Dow closed at 2902.23 and
showed signs of continuing an
upward trend.

Bakker will get
new sentence

A federal appeals court
Tuesday called for the resentencing
of tclevangclist Jim Bakker, claiming
that the original sentence of 45 years
imprisonment was influenced by the
biases of the judge, as indicated by
comments made during the
sentencing procedure.

The three judges sitting on the
United States Court of Appeals panel
for the Fourth Circuit upheld the
conviction Bakker faces on 24
charges of conspiracy and fraud.

The charges came when Bakker
bilked his followers out of $158
million, some of which he used to
support his own lavish lifestyle.

The next step, according toone
of Bakker’s lawyers, will be a hearing
in Charlotte, N.C. to establish a
resentencing date. Sources did not
say whether the resentencing would
result in a shorter sentence.

similar actions.

Hann did notdeny the incident,
but said “I think it was justa political
statement by the university.”

Nearly two years prior to the
incident, Hann attended a race
relations workshop and counsel for
alcohol abuse as punishment for
aiming racial slurs toward a student
ata fraternity bar.

Greek life, improvements inresident
assistant training, acting as an
advocate for both women and gay/
lesbian student groups, and
contributing to the community of
Lewisburg.

Looking back on her stay at
the University, Weddle assessed, “I
generally have a sense that I do good
work. President Sojka has always.
told me I have. I’ve never received
any negative feedback, and I have
always been well regarded.”

Referring to the nature of her
position, Weddle continued,
“Student affairs is a wonderful job,
but also a killer. I believe my body
needs a change.”

Weddle leaves Bucknell at a
time when she believes the
University is on the upswing. “There
isa vitality on campus now that I feel
has changed in my time here,” she
said. “Students can find many
different ways to make friends and
be active rather than thinking there’s
only one way—the Greek life.”

Nevertheless, isolated
incidents have brought Weddle
difficult times in recent years. “Act
31 and the faculty vote [to abolish

the Greeks] were body blows. The

FIJI-DU fight had one of the most

profound negative impacts on the

campus. That was one of the main

instigators for the faculty vote.”
Greaves

Greaves leaves his postas vice-
president after four years, but he will
continue to be an integral part of the
campus community as he assumes.
the role of full-time professor of
anthropology.

“It is with substantial relief
that I will be able to focus all of my
efforts into teaching,” said Greaves.
“My first love is anthropology.”

Greaves said a number of
factors influenced his decision to step
down, including the fact that Bucknell
is in the process of reducing
expenditures.

“T think the University itself is
encountering more challenging
financial situations than it has in the
past,” explained Greaves. “We are
going to have to reduce our spending

The Bucknellian

in several areas, and as the president
has indicated, and I certainly agree
with him, the size of the
administration at the University is
also going to have to be reduced.”

Greaves was quick to stress
that the administration’s financial
woes are minor compared to those at
many other universities.

President Sojka has asked
Barbara Shailor, current special
assistant to the president, to assume
ayet-to-be-created vice-presidential
position that will fuse many of the
responsibilities previously handled
by both Weddle and Greaves.

Inaddition tocurrently serving
as special assistant, Shailor also
heads Bucknell’s Affirmative Action
and Jan Plan programs.

One of Shailor’s most positive
attributes is her strong ability to
accept suggestions and advice from
others. Shailor said, “I want to hear
what people have to say, and will be
guided by their experience.”

Asst. Professor of Music,
Lois Svard, to debut in NY

By Maria Glod

Lois Svard, assistant professor
of music, at Bucknell, will have her
New York recital debut on
Wednesday, Feb. 20, at 8 p.m. in
Merkin Concert Hall at the Abraham
Goodman House.

Svard has received
international acclaim for her
performances of contemporary piano
music. This recital will include the
New York premiers of works by
American experimental composers
Jerry Huntand “Blue” Gene Tyranny.

Svard worked personally with
the composers of many of the pieces
she will perform. In 1989, producer
and performer Tyrrany composed
“Nocturne With and Without
Memory” for her. In addition to
playing “Nocturne,” Lois will
perform “Imaginary Dance,” a piece
written for her by Bucknell Professor
of Music William Duckworth, as well
as works by European composers
Hans Otte and Gyorgy Ligeti.

“A lot of musicians are afraid
to take a chance on a new piece,”
Svard said. “I find it exciting to
perform works that have never been
played before and to havea chance to
work on these pieces with the
composers.”

A native of Minnesota, Svard
began her musical training at age
five. She studied at the University of
Colorado in Boulder and recently
received a Doctor of Musical Arts in
piano performance from the Peabody
Institute of the Johns Hopkins
University. She taughtat the Eastman
School of Music in Rochester, NY
and has been at Bucknell for the past
six years. Aside from performing
widely in the Netherlands, Germany
and throughout the U.S., she has
written articles for Musical America,
Keyboard, and Notes.

The music department is
organizing a bus trip to New York
City for Lois Svard’s Merkin Hall
Recital. The cost of the bus is $15 per
person. Tickets to the the concert
may be purchased at Merkin Hall
upon arrival at the cost is $10 ($6 for

students). Those who are interested
in reserving tickets may call the
Merkin Hall Box office at (212) 362-
8719. Nancy Stover, music
department secretary (524-1216),
may also becontacted for reservations
or more information.

Pizzuto visits dance dept.

By Ashley Shrader

Dancer and teacher William
Pizzuto,amember of Baryshnikov’s
new White Oak Dance Project, spent
February 10-12 with Bucknell
dancers. Students and Dance
Company members were able to take
ballet classes taught by Mr. Pizzuto
who has performed throughout North
and South America, Europe, and the
orient.

Shellie Cash-Muller, Bucknell
Assistant Professor of Dance, and
Mr. Pizzuto trained together years
ago under the direction of Ruth C.
Petrinovic at the Academy of
Performing Arts in Ft. Lauderdale,
Florida. Although the two have since
traveled different avenues with their
dancing, they were able tomeetagain
this week during the special classes.

Mr. Pizzuto has choreo-
graphed works for the Houston
Ballet, Boston Ballet II, Ballet
Florida, Appalacian Ballet, and, most
recently, a new production of “The
Nutcracker” for Ballet New England.
His honors include both the silver
medal and special juries award for
bestcouple in the 1982 International
Ballet Competition in Jackson,
Mississippi.

Mr. Pizzuto plans to continue
conducting ballet workshops,
choreographing new works as well
as established ballets, and, of course,

continue dancing with the White Oak
Dance Project.

Frequently called a “vocal
string quartet,” the group combines
their sounds with the latest in
electronic technology to produce
works of many different styles and
by many different composers. For
more than a decade they have
entertained audiences throughout the
world. Many people like the radical
approach their new vocalic sounds
and massive sound system bring to
their performance.

A highlight of this concert will
be a collaboration with the Rooke
Chapel Choir for Benjamin Britten’s
“A Hymntothe Virgin.” “I’mexcited
about it,” said William Payn, director
of the choir. “It is a great experience
for the choir to participate with a
vocal group.”

The performance marks the end
of Electric Phoenix’s shortresidency
here at Bucknell. The group’s artistic
director, Terry Edwards, conducted
workshops this week dealing with
the musical trends of the twentieth-
century. Students were given hands-
on time with the group’s electronic
equipment.

Electric Phoenix will also be
performing a piece composed by
music professor William Duckworth
entitled “Songs of the Pale
Horseman.” This work, which
explores the subject of death, is
written in nine short scenes varying
from song-like to dramatic.

The four singers, mezzo-
soprano Meriel Dickinson, soprano
Judith Rees, tenor Daryl Runswick,
and bass Terry Edwards, along with
sound engineer John Whiting, have
produced three albums. The first,
released in 1982, was voted “Record
of the Year” by London’s Sunday
Times.

Tickets are still available
through the Weis Center Box Office
(x1000) and also at the door.

Bloomsburg Theatre Ensemble
presents Candida thru Feb. 24

G.B Shaw’s romantic comedy is a delight for all

By Laura Grisin

Do your horizons need
expanding? Have you not been
satisfied with Lewisburg’s cultural
offerings? Perhaps you should
consider a night on the town in
Bloomsburg with the Bloomsburg
Theatre Ensemble (BTE) and their
latest production, George Bernard
Shaw’s Candida.

As the third production in the
BTE’s “Faces of Comedy” season,
Candida explores the relationships
between men and women and,
specifically, how men’s idealization
of women is the female race’s
biggest obstacle in their quest for
equality.

Shaw presents a humorous
love story set in late nineteenth-
century London. James, an
energetic, genial parson and popular
orator, perceives himself to be the
master of his house and his wife,

Candida, whom he has placed high
on a pedestal. As Shaw explains,
however, he is really “a great baby”
because as James competes for her
attention with Eugene, a shy, fragile
18-year-old poet, we see that Candida
is truly the master of this house.

Shaw once stated that he wrote
Candida as a response to Henrik
Ibsen’s A Doll's House, because in
his experience “...in the real typical
Doll’s House it is the man who is the
Doll.” Indeed, this play is a delight
for men and women alike.

Though the Bloomsburg
Theatre Ensemble has acquired
national acclaim, few Bucknellians
are even aware of its existence. A
definite exception is 1990 Bucknell
graduate Jonathan Uffelman who is
currently an intem with the BTE.
Also, ensemble member Laurie
McCants is currently teaching
beginning theatre classes here at
Bucknell.

Later this month the BTE’s
Theatre in the Classroom tour will
begin its thirteenth year by taking
Land of the Rising Sun toschools in
the Philadelphia area. In June, BTE
actors leave for Africa to conduct
discussions and workshops in
American embassies.

In the meantime, however,
the BTE will finish out its “Faces of
Comedy” season in Bloomsburg
with Candida through Feb. 24,
Tennessee Williams’ Out Cry (Mar.
21-Apr. 7), and Georges Feydeau’s
13 Rue de L'Amour (May 2-25).

Performances are Thursdays
through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and
Sundays at 3 p.m. at the Alvina
Krause Theatre, 226 Center Street,
Bloomsburg. Tickets are $12
Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and $14
Saturday. Student and seniorcitizen
tickets are half-price. For ticket info
call the theatre box office at 784-
8181.

Issues Versus Motives
ROTC Fulfills “Diverse Education” Criteria

Monday’s faculty meeting was filled with the conflict between the ideals of a liberal arts education and

the demands of our society. The issue of abolishing Bucknell’s ties to the ROTC program, when
considered in the context of the Gulf crisis, should have provoked an open and spirited debate among
our faculty. However, a current of anti-war sentiment appeared to be underlying this new movement
toward a break from the ROTC program, and some members of the faculty were more interested in
making an immediate and symbolically weighted statement against the war than with carefully
weighing the motion’s ramifications.

The most compelling argument made by those in favor of severing all ties with ROTC asserts that the
program discriminates on the basis of gender and sexual orientation, practices in direct conflict with
the University’s express non-discrimination policy.

George Jenks, author of the motion, also claims that the sole objective of military courses is to teach
students to kill people and destroy property. While it is true and necessary that the courses include

those lessons, students are also taught discipline, assertiveness, and leadership skills.

Jenks’ narrow scope also fails to consider the need for an adequate defense in today’s world society,

consisting of well-educated officers and soldiers. Abolishing one of the Army’s finest ROTC programs

would clearly be a step in the opposite direction.

Finally, the severing of ties with ROTC would have a devastating effect on Bucknell’s financial aid
program. While the need for financial assistance may appear to some as a dependence on “tainted
monies,” it is nonetheless a very important practical consideration and one which we cannot ignore.
Merit-based scholarships are few and far-between, and their retention at Bucknell is of the utmost

importance to many.

One further point to ponder: many assert that the military courses are incongruent with Bucknell’s
focus on providing a liberal arts education. Is this not directly contradictory to common sense? By
definition, a liberal arts education should include exposure to many diverse perspectives and values.
By deeming the values of ROTC to be “inappropriate,” there appears to be a squelching of the very
ideals of liberal arts education.

A vote by the faculty to eliminate the ROTC program would be a slap in the face to the true principles
of a liberal education, eliminate one of the University’s strongest leadership curricula and result in

dire financial aid consequences for the University. Most importantly, ROTC should not become a

pawn to further the anti-war objectives of the faculty.

U.S. role in Persian Gulf

to College Students:

dissenters. And daily his troops
commit atrocities against Kuwaiti
citizens.

This brutality has
reverberated throughout the entire
world. If we do not follow the
dictates of our inner moral compass
and stand up for human life, then
his lawlessness will threaten the
peace and democracy of the
emerging New World order we
now see: this long dreamed-of
vision we’ ve all worked toward for
so long.

A year after the joyous dawn
of freedom’s light in Eastern
Europe, a dark evil has descended
in another part of the world. But
we have the chance, and we have
the obligation, to stop ruthless
aggression.

T haye been in war. I have
known the terror of combat. And I
tell you this with all my heart: I
don’t want there to be a war ever
again. I am determined to do
absolutely everything possible in
the search for a peaceful resolution
to this crisis— but only if the peace
is genuine, if it rests on principle,
not appeasement.

But while we search for that
answer, in the Gulf young men and
women are putting their own lives
on hold in order to stand for peace
in our world and for the essential
value of human life itself. Many
are younger than my own children.
Your age, most of them. Doing
tough duty for something they
believe in.

“Mr. President, I just
wanted you to know my soldiers
and I are ready to do whatever
mission you decide. Freedom as
we know and enjoy has been
taken away from another country
and must be restored. Although
we are separated from family,
friends, loved ones, we will do
what must be done.... We stand
ready and waiting. God Bless
you and the U.S.A.”

Terry understands the
moral obligation that has
compelled our extraordinary
multi-national coalition to make
this stand in the Gulf. To look
this international terrorist straight
in the eye and say: no
concessions. To proclaim for
now and the future: no
compromises. To bear witness by
our presence to the fact that
aggression will not be rewarded.

Terry waits thousands of
miles from the White Hose, yet
we share the same thoughts. We
desperately want peace. But we
know that to reward aggression
would be to end the promise of
our New World Order. To
reward aggression would be to
destroy the United Nation’s
promise as international
peacekeeper. To reward
aggression would be to condone
the acts of those who would
desecrate the promise of human
life itself.

And we will do none of
this. There are times in life when

card. And this is what he wrote.

If armed men invaded a
home in this country, killed those
in their way, stole what they
wanted and then announced the

would hesitate about what must
be done.

And that is why we cannot
hesitate about what must be done
halfway around the world: in

There is much in the
modem world that is subject to
doubts or questions—washed in

“Widespread abuses of human

and the extrajudicial execution of

Should the U.S. be involved in the Gulf war?

By Stephen J. Leshinski

After all the flag-waving and ribbon-wearing and horn-honking; after all the articles are written and
speeches are made and songs are sung; after all the rubble’s cleared and all the bodies buried, the questions will
remain and if we’re not prepared to answer these questions, honestly and thoughtfully, then we have to stop right
now. Why is everyone so convinced that war is the only way to get done what we think needs be done? Our
children will ask, weren’t there other ways of doing it? Wasn’t there an opportunity for diplomacy or economic
sanctions? And although we will say we tried, can we say we tried hard enough? What do we risk to lose by using
diplomacy and economic sanctions: the annexation of Kuwait? the domination of foreign oil -by Saddam
Hussein? Yet what do we risk to lose by going to war? Everything.

Even now we watch the oil flood the gulf and the bombs destroy the houses and the bullets kill the people
and we are hurt and scared. But the most frightening part of war is not what is known but what is unknown.
Dwight Eisenhower said, “Every war will astound you.” World War II led to the atomic bomb; Vietnam led to
Agent Orange and still today countries all over the world are recovering from these tragedies. What will this one

war?

We will have to tell our children we thought of all this when we decided that war was right. That even
though we couldn’t begin to imagine the cost in human life or the environmental damage it might bring, we
thought it was that important to us to fight. Even though our objectives were unclear and that Americans would
make up to 90% of the casualties in this “world-wide coalition” and that anti-American demonstrations would
tear apart already strained Arab-American relations, that all of us looked into ourselves and saw, with the clarity
and resolve that a war demands, that our answer would have to be: yes, war.

I think this war can and should be opposed on all levels. Right from the start our objectives have been
unclear, and yet we decided that this was an issue of paramount importance. Right from the start the nation was
divided and the Congress split right up the middle, but George Bush continued to insist that the nation was
completely behind the use of force. Right from the start the efficacy of war was doubted. Right from the start
no one knew for sure what they were getting into or why. Right from the start millions suffered from AIDS,
homelessness, malnutrition, and illiteracy but still our government spends close to a billion dollars a day
thousandsof miles away. If it doesn’t make sense now, how can it make sense in ten years?

By Richard Chew III

This nation may take comfort in our reaction to the Persian Gulf War. Support for our troops has been near
universal regardless of personal beliefs concerning the conduct of Operation Desert Storm by the government.
However, it must remain clear and indisputable, that support for our troops is not tantamount to support for the
policies of the Bush administration in implementing United Nations resolutions to remove Saddam Hussein’s
dictatorial oppression of the Kuwaiti people. In the few weeks since the war has been joined by the forces of the
coalition against Iraq, anumber of significant phenomena have been realized that should convince all but the most
stalwart isolationist or foolhardy pacifist that war represents the only option, the only reasonable choice.

The strength of the allied bombing of Iraq represents an unprecedented display of air power in military
history. Never before has a nation withstood so much destructive force in such a short period of time. Despite
legendary air strikes against London, Dresden, Japan and Vietnam, air power on this level has heretofore remained
unrealized. Allied forces have now flown close to sixty-thousand sortles, unleashing nearly half a million tons
of explosives against Iraqi targets, raining an unstoppable fury of death upon the awaiting hell below. And Hussein
has muscled down into Kuwait even further. It is a testimony to that dictator’s extreme disregard for human life
that he has notconceded when faced with annihilation, and should stand as proof that the continuation of economic
sanctions alone would have been a fruitless and insufficient gesture. Allied forces have crippled the Iraqi
economy, yet Hussein beckons to the West that the slaughter continue. Economic sanctions would have only
succeeded in changing the angle of the gun that Hussein is holding at the head of the Kuwaiti people when it was
desperately clear that the gun had to be removed from his possession. The forty-seven Democrats who voted in
favor of sanctions, and anyone who sympathized with such an approach, must now realize that military action
represented the only viable solution.

Others complain that the bombing has been carried too far, that the United States has exceeded the United
Nations mandates in seeking the destruction of Iraq rather than the liberation of Kuwait. Just as the American
people have learned to support their troops despite the nature of the conflict, American leaders have learned that
war must be massive and decisive. To have launched a direct frontal assault upon Iraqi positions in Kuwait would
have been suicidal, and instead of having fewer than a hundred U.S. casualties and nearly a fifth of Iraq’s fighting
capability obliterated, there would have been tens of thousands of wasted lives with the unfortunate remainder
faced with an enemy largely unscarred by the face of war. We have fought this war on our own terms, not

Parent urges Sojka to
limit activities of S.T.O.P.

Dear Dr. Sojka,

Tam writing to appeal to you
to take a firm stand in front of your
trustees, administration, faculty,
staff and student body with regard
to the antics of $.T.O.P. Asa
concermed parent, I was horrified to
receive issues of The Bucknellian
showing this organization defacing
the grounds of Bucknell University
without restraint, namely, the mock
graves by the University Center
and the chalking of sidewalks.

As the president of a private
institution, you have every right
and the obligation to interpret and
dictate those policies which best
serve the University. My daughter,
Janelle, 93, tells me that it is the
University’s view that “freedom of

speech” is at the heart of S.T.O.P.’s
ability to embark on these shameful
displays. Has your desire to
maintain an open campus where
academic freedom and the
exploration of knowledge is
enkindled by any kind of
expression clouded your vision?
Dr. Sojka, it is somewhere around
the age of seven that the
philosophy of “rights and duties” is
introduced to the human mind. If
one fails to grasp the concept at
that time, there is yet another
chance some years later in Logic
101. Simply put, and there is no
need to be otherwise, that concept
states: an individual has every right
to freely express himself in any
manner he chooses so long as that

expression does not infringe on the
rights of others. With all due
respect, Dr. Sojka, I would suggest
that my daughter’s rights and that
of many others on campus are
being infringed upon by S.T.O.P.’s
antics.

It is deeply upsetting to her to
have to view these displays on a
daily basis. It is offensive to her to
be “told” that the only thing at
stake in the Middle East is the
number of Americans who will die
if there is war. It is not right for her
and others to be subjected to this
kind of obscene behavior. She and
others have the “right” to be
Protected from sanctimonious,

Faith helps overcome war worries

To the Editor:

The United States is
currently involved in a war in the
Gulf. However, I am more
concerned by the inner turmoil that
is occurring here at home.
Everything has gone crazy. The
world has exploded in war and
people’s brains have gone right
with it. Personally, I have no
problem with feeling out of control
of the situation. Who am I to even
begin to think that I have such
power? God is in full control of my
life. And God is in full control of
the situation in the Middle East. I
trust Him completely.

“There is a time for every
purpose under heaven”
(Ecclesiastes 3:1). There is “a time
for peace and a time for war”
(Ecclesiastes 3:8). If now is the
time for war, who am I to question

God’s judgment? It’s not that I
don’t care, I do. I am afraid that the
worst will happen. I am afraid that
there will be a draft and I will see
boys and men I love go off to
Saudi Arabia and fight and dic. I
am afraid to see the yellow ribbons
replaced by black. So there it is:
the worst case scenario. And if it
happens, God will help me through
It.

What annoys me is that
everyone is spending so much time
thinking about the worst case
scenarios (many fully justified) that
they are not enjoying the time they
are given now. Okay, perhaps you
will have to fight or see those you
love fight and possibly die (I offer
no judgment on which is worse).
But what good will it do to spend
every minute until then worrying
about it? If this is to be the last six

months you spend with those you
love, are you going to worry or are
you going to savor every possible
moment of time that remains? I
would hate to sec those I love die
on the battleficld. But I would hate
even more to see them die before
they got there.

We are a generation that
grew up knowing nothing of war.
Our lack of experiential knowledge
only heightens our fears. But war is
nothing to be afraid of if only we
trust in the almighty power of God.
Who else is best capable of
destroying a madman like Hussein?

Tam surprised to find that I
am more afraid of the chaos around
me than I am of the chaos of the
actual war. I am amazed at all the

Hussein’s, and the systematic destruction of Iraqi war-making ability serves that purpose.

President Bush’s naked lie

By Rob Schroeder

A few weeks ago, George Bush
told the world a lic. Before millions
of people, he claimed that the United
States of America has “worked long
and hard to achieve a peaceful
solution” in the conflict between Iraq
and Kuwait. Now immortalized, his
words are ringing in my ears like a
bomb blast searing through a soldier’s
brain. I am stunned. Bush said he
gave peace a chance. But the sound
reverberating in my ears isn’t a
sonorous one, nor one that makes me
proud of my President for trying his
best. The sound is sinister. I can’t
believe him, try as I may. And now,
as the world and I watch the death
tolls rise, I am desperately asking
myself one simple question: “Why is
the U.S. in the Persian Gulf?”

Thanks to the mass media, all
ofus have heard the official arguments
for the United States’ military build-
up in the region. It’s entirely about
“naked aggression,” the White House
would have us think; it’s about
freedom, emancipation, and righting
the wrong of Saddam Hussein’s
invasion of Kuwait. Mr. Hussein and
Mr. Bush themselves have put it in
even simpler terms: their two

countries are locked in Armageddon.
It is a classic conflict of good versus
evil; andeach man thinks he embodies
the good. The two men have made a
moral spectacle out of the conflict in
the Middle East, and have raced into
solving it the hard and fast way:
through force. War is now upon us.
The United States is in the Persian
Gulf for two reasons: to win that war,
and to stand up for what it thinks is
correct. The truth of democracy, say
U.S. politicians, shall make Kuwait
free.

Day in and day out, we the
people are fed this passionate
rhetoric...and it’s pretty believable.
Small wonder. Inspired and
awestrmck by Bush’s televised daily
lessons, the American people have
been sapped of their critical thinking.
We have almost no choice but to
agree and cheer on. The media
applauds Bush...and makes us forget
that there’s a flipside to reading his
lips. We forget that the United States
has ignored so-called “naked
aggression” in the past, and forget
that this country’s war machine is
running its fastest since the Vietnam
era. We are forced to overlook the
cries of “No blood for oil!,” and are
cruelly made to watch the “justified”

Indoctrinated by the government, we
have lost sight of the harsh realities of
the hell on earth that people call war.
Some call it a just war. I call ita
deadly mistake by the headstrong
President of a hypocritical country.
Why? Because there are things that
Bush hasn’t been telling you.

Our president hasn’t told us
about Indonesia, Turkey, Morocco,
or Israel. These countries respectively
took over East Timor, northern
Cyprus, the Spanish Sahara, and
Southern Lebanon through the current
rallying point of American foreign
policy: naked aggression. Each
invasion was unprovoked by military
action, and every bit as brutal as the
Iraqi’s of Kuwait. Yet each went
virtually unnoticed by the United
States, and went unpunished. Where
were the passionate speeches then?
Where was the concern for human
rights? The United States’
willingness to forgive our allies ought
to make you wonder how concerned
our policy makers really are with
“naked aggression.” This forgiveness
should also make you wonder if there
is something else that is keeping your
friends and neighbors in the Persian
Gulf. And it should ultimately

convince you that US foreign policy
revolves around much more than
aggression.

Oilis a big reason the U.S. is in
the Gulf, whether you want to believe
itor not. “If Kuwait’s main export
was carrots,” queried a New York
Times editorial some weeks ago, “do
you think that the United States would
be there?” That’s a good question.
It’s interesting to note that six of the
twelve largest U.S. corporations are
oil monopolies, depending on the
region for its reserves of the precious
fuel. And it is even more interesting
to note whose way of life we are
defending: profit-making
corporations and oil-hungry countries
without alternative energy policies.
Bush might claim to be defending
Kuwait’s way of life, but when was
the last time you heard that the U.S.
supported monarchies so strongly that
it was willing to kill for one? Kuwait
and Saudi Arabiaare no democracies.
What they areis insurance. Insurance
that oil is cheap and profits are high.
Would we be there if there wasn’t a
threat to our high standard of living?
Even as I hear the sounds of aircraft
fire and bombs bursting over
Baghdad, Icanonly answer to myself,
dejectedly, “no.” The patriot in me

wants to believe that George Bush
has not gone to war—in any way—
for oil. The realist in me, though,
knows he has.

George Bush and his
administration have fooled us. They
have tricked us, the citizenry of the
world, into believing that the United
States’ commitment in the Persian
Gulf is solely to democracy, and a
free way of life for the Kuwaitis.
“The rights of liberty and
independence should be granted with
godspeed to all people on earth,” I
can imagine Mr. Bush saying witha
tear in his eye. And for a moment, I
can imagine myself thinking he’ struly
sincere. My heart would thump with
apatriotic fervoras my President told
me everything was ok; but not for
long. Too much hypocrisy exists for
me to believe Bush. Too many
contradictions exist. It would not
take me long to think of South Africa,
for instance, where blacks still
miserably struggle for democracy,
and have been subjected to
innumerable acts of violent
aggression. It doesn’t take a genius
to figure out that the United States
haseconomic interests in thatcountry,
and perhaps make the connection that
heavy sanctions would be a suicidal
move. The conflict in Isracl would
also come quickly to mind, along
with the United States’ reluctance to
stand up for the rights of Palestinians
in that country. We must remember,
after all, that the U.S. has a free trade

agreement with Israel. Investments,
economics, free trade...it all adds up
toone big contradiction: where there’s
money to be made, the United States
will (or will not) stop “naked
aggression.” Clearly the U.S. is
concerned with more than America’s
newest household term. There’s
money at stake.

Every day, more American and
allied planes are reported missing,
and more soldiers are pronounced
dead. Meanwhile, the $30 billion
spent on Desert Shield increases, as
the Desert Storm rages across the
land of the Middle East. While the
United States fights its overseas war
for the American way, taxesare raised
and services are cut at home. For
soldiers, their families, and people
like you and me, suffering is on the
rise...and for what? This war is not
just about “naked aggression.” Bush
is just plain lying if he says that oil
and economics are not major reasons
the U.S. is in the Persian Gulf. His
reassuring voice, the voice that told
the world he gave peace achance, has
now receded from the depths of my
brain. In its place are the cries of
dying soldiers, and the fatal clock
ticking down to the bitter end when
the smoke clears and the tolls are
added up. I’ve been lied to, and I feel
pretty bad. Don’t you?

Todd Barnhart ’91

“The way itstands, I don’t think
the Jan Plan is worth much. As
long as we don’t receive any
credit I don’t feel people take it
seriously. I’m in favor of
receiving some sort of credit
toward graduation.”

Weddle resigns
student life post

To the Bucknell Community:

It is with mixed feelings
that I announce that I will be
leaving Bucknell at the end of the
spring semester. For personal and
career reasons my husband and I
have decided to move to the
South to be nearer to our family
roots and his professional
network. This has been a difficult
decision as this is a challenging
and exciting time to be involved
in reshaping student life at
Bucknell and I have had much
personal and professional
satisfaction in being a part of it,
but Jim and I feel that this move
is the right one for us at this time
and for our future.

Bucknell has been a
wonderful experience for me, and
I have really enjoyed being a
member of this very special
educational partnership. I feel that
I have accomplished my major
administrative goals and tasks
assigned to me by the President
on arriving at Bucknell five years
ago with assistance from many of
you. I leave with confidence that
the Division of Student Life’s
excellent staff will continue the
fine programs and high quality
services which are now in place
for students.

During the coming semester
I look forward to working with

old “There’s a war and life stinks.”
I am more distraught by the

grandmother, | flunked a Bio exam,
and now there’s this stupid war!”
Obviously, different people
will have different reactions to the
war based on their own personal
experience (or lack thereof). Some
people feel especially threatened
because the war is one thing they
have absolutely no control over.
And it drives them crazy. And they

July.

I look forward with
enthusiasm to identifying
specifically the right combination
of needs and opportunities to
engage my energies in the years
to come, having already had two
different and rewarding major
careers in my life. I particularly
want to complete some long-
deferred research and writing
before committing myself to
anything on a full-time basis, but
I am open to interesting career

and I responded “Oh well, we can

but honestly, what good will it do
to watch CNN twenty-four hours a
day and just worry and worry and

I refuse. Besides, there are
more than enough people worrying
for me. But I will not let them
disturb the inner calm, the inner
peace I have found. There is a war
and no one can be sure what will
happen. The only thing we can do
is wait and pray and trust that God
will show the way. The world is

e Bucknellian

Faculty member
supports breaking
ties with R.O.T.C.

To The Bucknellian:

On February 11, the faculty
decided to delay voting on the
motion to sever ties between the
university and ROTC. The purpose
of the delay is to allow a fuller
discussion of this complex issue.
The issue is complex because it
engages both principles and
persons, both abstractions and
concrete human beings. Each
member of the Bucknell
community will have to find some
way to make peace with these
various parts of the question

The principle at stake is our
university policy against
discrimination because of gender
and sexual orientation. To the
extent that the motion isa
symbolic comment on the war,
another principle at stake is our
university policy of furthering
human thought and discourse as
the alternative to domination and
violence. ROTC and its Army
patron violate both of these
principles.

The people at stake are
military personnel—our students
currently in ROTC and those who
might come to Bucknell because
Bucknell can help them to take
advantage of ROTC scholarships.
And, to the extent that the motion
is a symbolic comment on the war,
the people at stake are American
men and women fighting in the
Gulf.

What needs discussion is
how each of us can juggle
contradictory conclusions. For my
part, for example, I oppose the
ROTC in terms of principle, and
yet I want not to assault or insult
individuals for whom ROTC may
be their only way to go to college.
And I certainly oppose the war, as

well as the politicians who made
the policies that got us into it, and
yet I want not to tum on those in
the Gulf, caught up in the fray for
patriotic reasons or because they
believed the army would help them
be all they could be.

It is all very well for the
faculty to pronounce its position on
matters of principle, but this has to
be accompanied by other kinds of
faculty participation in Bucknell
culture—to educate, persuade,
listen, learn, teach our students, our
friends on the support staff, alumni,
and even parents. In the case of the
Greek vote last year, the faculty
voted on principle, then retreated to
their offices, expecting to be taken
seriously. But the Bucknell culture
we are trying to change is
complicated, and it requires more
than pronouncement by way of
faculty vote. It requires discussion,
the give and take of opinion, feeling
and fact.

Let us use the time until the
vote comes up, presumably in
March, to do better by our
constituents than we did before. Let
us keep the conversation going. I
shall support the motion to sever
Bucknell’s ties with ROTC,
because I believe that is in fact the
best way to support the people—
although I recognize this requires
an argument. That the argument
happens, that we recognize and
respect our differing opinions, that
we agree to be bound by the
outcomes in the spirit of patience
and tolerance—these are fruits of
the discussion we can live on long
after the vote.

The members of S.T.O.P. have the

they have a corresponding “duty”

If it were our son who was

ashamed that his memory and

the issues of a potential war should
not be discussed carefully and
rationally, but it does mean that the
hysterical, circus-like display that
characterizes S.T.O.P.’s protests
must be rejected and stopped.

I will not debate S.T.O.P.’s

Together, as an America

stopped and the principles on
which this nation and the rest of
the civilized world are founded are

And so let us remember and

Janelle and I and her father

finding the “right” university for
her. Not the least in our parameters
was a campus with a history of
conservative values, and so it is
disheartening to us after much
time and moncy to see S.T.O.P.’s
sacrilegious behavior in the name
of peace go unchallenged by the
University. It makes a mockery of
our Constitution’s freedom of
speech protection.

Therefore, I call upon you to
take the steps to protect my
daughter’s rights and those of
others, and immediately dismantle
the display in front of the U.C. and
prevent further such violations of
the rights of my daughter and
others. Thank you.

Readers react to student
criticism of BSG election results

Dear Sir:

Regarding the commentary
by David Murray on the outcome
of the B.S.G. election
(Bucknellian, Dec. 7, 1990), we
have read The Bucknellian both on
and off campus for many years
and have never seen such a
shameful display of “sour grapes.”

In any election there is a
winner and a loser. The winner is
decided by the voters (and if voter
apathy is a problem on campus
then this issue should be addressed
separately). Who is “better” must
be judged by time and
performance in the elected
position.

Mr. Murray appears to be
using his position as managing
editor of The Bucknellian to
engage in unneccessary name-

calling instead-of in constructive
criticism of actual policics or
events. It is unfortunate for Mr.
Murray that his preferred candidate
did not win, but a display of good
sportsmanship would be much
more welcome than the childish
tantrum that his remarks seem to
reflect.

Good luck to Ms. Mayo and
her fellow B.S.G. officers. We
hope that Mr. Murray’s comments
do not reflect the kind of support
that they will receive from the
student body whom they have been
elected to represent.

To the Editor:

Tam writing in response to an
editorial that appeared in the Dec.
7th issue of The Bucknellian
conceming the election of Vanessa
Mayo to the position of BSG
treasurer. In this editorial, David
Murray advanced several good
points and a few unfair ones. Was
attendance at pre-election speeches
and forums pathetic? Yes. Was
voter turn-out itself poor?
Definitely. Is it an atrocity that Ms.
Mayo was elected? I don’t think so.

Dave Fries was an excellent
candidate to be sure. He was my
special assistant and I am confident
that he would have done an
exemplary job. This docs not mean
that Ms. Mayo will not perform
well in her new position. No one
runs for a position, subjects

themselves to scrutiny, accepts
countless unpaid hours and takes on
tremendous responsibility if they do
not feel they have the dedication,
the skill and the foresight to get the
job done. Ms. Mayo’s success in
getting involved should be
applauded, not criticized. I mean no
disrespect to Mr. Murray; he spoke
Out on some important problems.
Like Ms. Mayo, Mr. Fries and
myself, Mr. Murray offered his
views in the hopes that it would
improve Bucknell; that’s something
we should all try to do. I wish Ms.
Mayo and the rest of the Bucknell
Student Government officers the
best of luck in the coming year.

Student clarifies BSG
election opinion

To the Editor:

Sometimes, even with good
intentions and a valid point, one’s
message is lost when written down.
Such is certainly the case with my
December 7, 1990 opinion about
the results of the Bucknell Student
Government elections.

In my opinions piece, I
unfairly and inappropriately singled
out Vanessa Mayo ’93. While I
personally believe Dave Fries °93
was a better choice in the election
for BSG treasurer, that was not
intended to be my point. In fact, I
am certain that Ms. Mayo will
adequately perform her duties and
am delighted that she cares enough
about Bucknell to volunteer.

The message I attempted to
convey was simply this: there was

inexcusable voter apathy. We did
Not educate ourselves sufficiently
about the candidates before we
voted for them, and many of us did
Not bother to vote at all.
Unfortunately, I used but one
example to substantiate my point,
and while Ms, Mayo is a public
figure open to public criticism, my
characterization of her as
‘incompetent’ was not based on
available, substantiated facts.

Now, with the elections long-
since passed, I can only repeat my
wish of ‘good luck’ to the BSG.
We'll be watching,

Bucknellians go Navajo in January

For 20 years, students have experienced Indian culture in Jan Plan

By Sue Basalla
Senior Staff Writer

A sleeper of a Jan Plan for the
last twenty years, the Navajo
teaching program offers students the
chance to be a teacher’s aide in a
Navajo boarding school. This
January, 31 Bucknellians travelled
to four different boarding schools in
Arizona and New Mexico: Tuba
City, Shonto, Chuska-Tohatchi and
Chinle. For three weeks, they lived
in dorms, assisted teachers in the
classroom, and participated in Boy
Scout hikes, basketball games and
school dances. While trying out their

teaching skills and rediscovering
elementary school cafetcria cuisine,
the Bucknellians also learned about
the Navajo culture. Informal
conversations with teachers,
administrators and Navajo children
provided the Bucknellians with an
introduction to the world of the
Navajo: its language, mythology and
social customs. (see sidebar "A
Navajo Journal”)

Although many students are
unaware that it even exists, the
Navajo Jan Plan has been a part of
the curriculum since 1971. The
program was developed in 1970,
when Dr. J. Charles Jones, emeritus

A Navajo Journal

Editor's Note: Following
are extracts from the journal Sue
Basalla kept while living at Shonto
this January.

Jan. 8 - First day, had no
clue what to expect. I was assigned
to a 7th and 8th grade language
arts class. Helped students with
their autobiographical essays,
good way to get to know them.
Their language skills were
surprisingly bad, then I
remembered that for many of them
English is their second language.
The kids were fun to work with
though- quick to laugh atanything.
Most of them just stare at us, talk
about us in Navajo and giggle.
Lots of giggling.

Jan. 9- Responded to their
journal entries today and learned
more about their lives at home.
Some empty Christmases, lots of
travelling to see relatives in
Colorado or California. My
favorite entry: “It was a boring
vacation. I chopped wood for my

grandmother and_ played
Nintendo. On New Year’s Eve
my mom had a baby.” An 8th
grade girl asked me how it feels to
be white. Tough question- I’ve
never stuck out in crowd before
the way I do here. She wrote that
“white women arc okay, but white
men give me the chills.”

Jan. 11 - The 7th & 8th
grade reading teacher (great guy!)
helped us through the somewhat
long Shonto weekend. Some kids
arc here but they don’tdoanything
but watch TV. We helped out with
the basketball tournament and
hiked into the canyon next to the
school, beautiful place.

Jan. 14- Musttakea special
breed of teacher to come out here.

The teachers all complain about
the red tape of BIA (Bureau of
Indian Affairs)- I would’ ve thought
the isolation would be their biggest
gripe. But actually, Shonto is
growing on me, too. It’s so empty
and quict, only mesas and grubby
little trees in every direction- no
traffic, no Mini-Marts, no Burger
Kings, no noise.

Jan. 23 - Saw first real
evidence of the poverty on the rez
today. Helped a girl write a letter
thanking her “Save the Children”
sponsor for the $2.00 he sent.
Strange, the kids wear British
Knights but that’s pretty much all
they own. One teacher told me that
when charities donate Christmas
presents the kids all ask for Nike
Pumps- that’s how they can afford
$90 sneakers.

Jan. 25 - Our last nighthere-
watched our 93rd basketball game.
At half-time they called all of us
onto the court to say goodbye. The
stud of the boy’s basketball team
put bright yellow “Shonto Bears”
hats on our heads- little kids gave
us necklaces of cedar beads which
bring good luck and chase away
bad dreams. Kids I’ve never seen
before asked for my address- hey,
mail is mail.

Jan. 26 - The bus driver who
took us back to Flagstaff today
told us about the industries that
have come to the rez. Even though
the uranium mining ctc. is
destroying their land, the Navajos
want cven more companics to
locate out here. They’re so
desperate for jobs that their poverty
overrides their traditional respect
for the environment. One more
conflict between the traditional and
the modern life...

Tuba City Boarding School. Hearing
Dr. Jones speak about his trip, a
chemical engineering student, Peter

Anderson (’77), wanted to sce the
reservation as well. The principal of
Tuba City Boarding School agreed to
house Anderson if he would help in
the classroom in return.

Anderson made “quite a
favorable impression,” according to
Dr. Jones. The next January, Tuba
City Boarding School accepted
fifteen Bucknell students who had
heard about the experience from
Anderson. Over the next few years,
Shonto, Chinlc and Chuska-Tohatchi
were also persuaded to accept
Bucknell students. These four
schools have hosted Bucknell
students for the past twenty years.

During the early 70’s, a fifth
school, Toya Boarding School,
experiemented with the Bucknell
program. Toya refused to accept
Bucknell students after the first year,
however, citing problems with
students bringing alcohol to the
reservation. (The Navajo Tribal
Council prohibits selling or
consuming alcohol on the reservation
because of the Navajos’ genetic
predisposition for alcoholism.)

In more recent years, the
Bucknell-Navajo connection has
been strained by the increasing
bureaucracy of the federal
government. In 1990, the Bureau of
Indian Affairs mandated that all
visitors staying in reservation schools
for longer than three days must
submit to a background check. The
law requiring this 10-page form was

prompted by concern about child
abusc in the schools.

Asked if any year of the
program seemed particularly
memorable, Dr. Jones, speaking from
his home in North Carolina, recalled
the ycar that two black students went
to the reservation. Traditionally, the
Navajo are prejudiced against black
people, but Harvey Edwards (‘78)
and Cynthia Jones (‘79) agreed to try
the program. According to Dr. Jones,
the students were quickly accepted
by the Navajo children. In fact,
Cynthia Jones taughtmodem African
dance to the kids and, as Dr. Jones
said, “Confounded anthropologists
for years to come.”

Although Bucknell University
and the Navajo schools have
succeeded in bridging their cultural
differences, the Navajo Jan Plan may
not last another twenty years.
According to Mr. Kee Dayzie,
educational consultant at Shonto
Boarding School, the schools are
teaching less and less of the
traditional Navajo legends, language
and customs. In three generations,
he predicted, the culture will have
virtually disappeared. And why
would Bucknell students travel
across the country to see just another
typical American middle school?

Bison Tales in quest of condoms

By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

The first time I boughtcondoms
Itook the direct approach. I strode up
to good-natured Dr. Bob at the
prescription counter, looked him right
in the eye and asked him politely for
some “Prophylactic Devices.”
Unfortunately, Dr Bob, who was no
longer a young man, thought I asked
for “Prophylaxis Devices.” I ended
up leaving Drug-Mart with a Water
Pick, Dental Floss, and three tubes of
Tartar Control Crest. Well, Dr. Bob
retired two years later, and during
those 24 months, my dresser drawer
mightnot have boasted a large supply
of rubbers, but I did have strong
gums and a healthy-looking smile.

Now that I’m a self-secure
college student I take the mature
approach. I wait until 1:00 in the
morning and buy them at a deserted
7-11. Ifthe guy at the counter speaks
English, I tell him they’ re for my dad.

Let’s face it, when it comes
to purchasing embarrassing supplics,
condoms rank right up there with
Kayopectate and Mylanta. I think
the general rule is that we are not
even allowed to talk about condoms,
let alone buy them. Interestingly
enough, itis still perfectly acceptable
to speak about the actual act of
intercourse, as long it is with a large

group of the same gender and you use
colorful euphemisms.

If the preceding logic
confuses you, just glance at the
following dialogue which can serve
as an “appropriate conversation”
guide. Note that Guys #1 and #2
exhibit proper sex-talk technique
complete with original and witty
imagery while Guy#3 has not quite
caught on. . .

Guy #1: Dudes, I had such a
great time Friday. I picked up this
percussionist-babe with bodacious
bongos and we went back to my place
AND DID THE BEDSPRING
BOSSA-NOVA 17 times in one night.

Everyone: Yeahh, alright,nice
going etc,

Guy #2: Well, I grabbed myself
this slam-hound from Australia with
really firm. . . Kangaroos, and she
took me to her room and TOSSED
MY BOOMERANG!!!!

Everyone: Way to go, what a
stud, cool etc.

Guy #3: Well, I did mect a
potential mating partner witha sizable
bust, but I didn’t have proper
protection so we didn’t go all the way.

Everyone: Booo, what a jerk,
Loooooser.

Guy#3: Instead we chugged
Kayopectate and played with my
Tartar Control Crest.

As you can plainly see any

HBO features Lewisburg

By Peter Lalos
Staff Writer

Home Box Office's “America
Undercover” series aired an hour-
long special Tuesday night on the
Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary.
The producers of the documentary
“Doing Time: Life Inside the Big
House" received from the Justice
Department unprecedented access
to film inside the maximum sccurity
institution.

From its opening scenes, the
film scemed intent on depicting the
harsh realities of prison life for both
the men who work andare imprisoned
within the penitentiary’s walls. This
theme was captured best during a
discussion with the prison’s
supervising officer in charge on the
topic of home-made weapons. The

officer explained to an incredulous
interviewer that home-made knives
(nicknamed “shanks”), not fists, were
the mostcommon modc of protection
for most inmates. The officer even
went so far as to display a reluctant
admiration for the prisoners’ ability
to fashion such an array of Icthal
weapons.

More telling about life inside
the “Big House,” as the Lewisburg
prison has come to be known, though,
was the documentary’s analysis of
prisoner mentality— if nothing else,
the film exemplified the fact that no
two are necessarily the same.

One inmate, who was
incarcerated for his involvement ina
France-based heroin smuggling
operation and sentenced to life
without parole, insisted to the
interviewer that he was framed. He
wenton to use the film’s interview as
a forum for denouncing the justice
system, in particular the courtroom
plea bargaining of another convicted
criminal which led to his current jail
term.

Another inmate, a dishwasher
in the penitentiary, demonstrated the
tendency of many prisoners to
gradually accept the countless
hardships and loss of basic libertics.
He calmly described the widespread
homosexuality amongst the inmate
ranks. Despite the distribution of
condomsin the facility, AIDS-related
deaths in the prisoner population are
an almost common occurence,an
expected fact of life.

A third inmate, a self-described
“nice guy,” pointed to self-defense
as the reason for his killing four
fellow inmated. Another man, who
was imprisoned for making multiple
threats on President Reagan’s life,
claimed that he wanted to be jailed in
order to conduct an “undercover”
investigation of the nation’s prison
system. Despite such a questionable
motivation, prison officials
determined him to be sane after
placing him under psychiatric
observation. Undoubtedly, cach man
questioned during the film had his
own way of dealing with his
confinement.

One of the last inmates to be
questioned had received three life
sentences for the triple homicide of
his nephew, sister, and her husband.
He asserted, however, that he had felt
no remorse for his crimes and had
completely forgiven himself since
he had discovered religion. Ironically
enough, the man said that it was a
section from the New Testament that
he read which fueled his desires to
commit the murders— he went so
far, in fact, as tosay thathe envisioned
his nephew asa “new devil.” There is
little wonder, then, as to why many
prison officials are skeptical about
the sudden discovery of God and the
subsequent “reform” of such inmates.

Despite the emphasis given to
prisoner life in the penitentiary, which
currently houses about 1,500 men, a
considerable amount of the
documentary’s footage also focused

mention or implication of the C word
is strictly forbidden and definitely
improper. That is why I’m so thankful
that our  ever-considcrate
administration appointed a special
task force to deal with potential
condom-buying embarrassment
when it was discovered that there
were, in fact, two boxes of them
being sold at the Bison Convenience
Store right here at Bucknell! The
“Official Condom Committee” in a
brilliant top secret maneuver known
as “Operation Flaccid” solved what
could have been an embarrassing
situation for all students by simply
removing the condoms from the shelf
and informing the manager that they
should not be ordered again.
Luckily though, the
committee decided to do nothing
about the 14 different brands of
cigarettes stocked right next to the
forbidden rubber sheathes. Which
makes sense because even though
cigarettes have been proven to cause
violent gagging deaths where green
slime painfully grows on your lungs
and eats away at your vocal chords
causing you to speak like a wooden
hinge, it is still socially acceptable
and not even slightly embarrassing
for the convenicnce store to carry
them. On the other hand, those nasty
litue condoms have been banished
down to laundry rooms all over

campus. However, even under ideal
conditions this dispenser location can
sometimes make life difficult...

Male Potential Sex Partner:
Well, we have been engaging in
stimulating foreplay for the past 45
minutes, I seem to be fully erect and
I think it is now time for penetration
to begin.

Female Potential Sex
Partner: Aren’t we lucky that we
havecondomsavailable just 5 flights
down?

Male Potential Sex Partner.
Yes, we certainly are. And even
though our clothes are flung all
around the room and we have worked
ourselves up to a complete sexual
frenzy. . . I just happen to have 50
cents in exact change right here to
make my purchase. See you ina few
minutes, Don’t go anywhere.

Female Potential Sex
Partner: Honey, do you think you
could buy. . . two of them?

Male Potential Sex Partner:
Oh no. Sorry dear, I don’t have
enough nickels.

So the question remains: How
can we obtain convenient access toa
varicty of condoms without having
to face the humiliation of buying
them at the Convenience Store? And
the answer is...

Next Week: The solution to
the prophylactic predicament.

penitentiary

on the institution’s officals. A
segment run at the midway point of
the film keyed in on the role of the
prison’s warden, who was shown
making his daily tour of Lewisburg’s
cell blocks. He patiently stopped to
listen to the concerns of the
disgruntled inmates, all the while
imploring them to go through the
properchannels of dialogue and “put
it in writing.” It grew increasingly
evident that the warden had long ago
mastcred the ability to make
concessions to his charges without
giving too much ground.

Similarly, the documentary
displayed how the institution’s
hearings officer has grown
accustomed to repeatedly handing
down rulings on offenses committed
inside the prison, often based on
nothing more than the testimonies of
cell guards and/or other inmates. In
both cases, the officials were depicted
as men who were being forced to
smooth out potentially volatile
situations on a daily basis.

The final aspect of the film’s
emphasis on the routine of the
institution’s staff focused on the role
of the penitentiary’s Special
Operations Response Team (SORT),
an clite group of guards required at
all high-security level federal prisons.
SORT is utilized in the same manner
as police SWAT teams, for riot or
hostage situations.

The special showed the team
in two separate file tape videos
released by the U.S. Justice

Department, in which they removed
violent inmates from their cells and
transported them to other holding
blocks.

In an institution where the
inmatcs outnumber the staff by a
ratio of six to one, the SORT guards’
aim is to insure the orderly handling
of such prisoners along with the
minimalizing of physical harm to
both staff and inmates in the process.

Fittingly, however, the
documentary concluded with
segments of yet more prisoner case
studies, and onc in particular seemed
tosum up the inmates’ overall plight.
Itdealt with a convict who fashioned
himsclf as a top-notch rapper and
was not hesitant to display his talents
to the film crew. The message in his
rap was thought-provoking cnough,
but the perfection in his rhythm and
his fluid enunciation were more
telling. He gave the type of letter-
perfect delivery which, one would
believe, could only be attained after
endless, repetitive practice. Perhaps
this perfection was attainable
because, as the “Doing Time”
documentary demonstrated, time is
the inmates’ only true companion.

Wrestlers rebound after trip wes

Grapplers to take on Delaware tomorrow following three victories in their last four matches

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

The Bucknell grapplers began
the second half of their season by
competing in twelve dual meets,
including seven against teams ranked
among the top twenty-five in the
nation. The difficulty of the schedule
resulted in the Bison losing eight of
their matches, and winning only
four. The schedule, intended to
challenge the team, appeared to be
somewhat overwhelming after a
series of tough west coast meets.
Coach Bob Ferraro remained
optimistic despite the losses. He looks
foward to having a successful record
in the conference.

On January 11th, the grapplers
went to Millersville where they won
their first dual meet of the year.
However, the Bison went on to lose
their next seven matches, against
North Carolina State, Cal Poly-SLO,
Fresno State, Arizona State, Cal State
Bakersfield, East Stroudsburg and
Rider. The trip to the west coast
included meets against some of the
toughest schools Bucknell will face
all season. Bryan Burns ’91 thought
the trip was still productive. “The
west coast trip prepared us well for
the rest of the season against

conference teams,” he said. The loss
to Rider College was the most
heartbreaking thus far because the
rivalry between the two schools has
grown to be one of the fiercest of
any Bison sports.

On February 8th, the Bison
turned things around by defeating
Lycoming at home. They would end
up winning three of their last four
matches. Lycoming entered the
match ranked seventeenth in
Division III but proved to be no
contest for the Bison. Bucknell won
the dual meet 46-4 to raise their
record to 2-7. The loss was just the
second of the season for Lycoming.
Bucknell thoroughly dominated the
meet winning in nine of ten weight
classes, seven of those coming by
pin or technical fall.

AfterLycoming, the grapplers
headed to Navy. In their firstmatch-
up against nationally-ranked Navy,
the Bison came up short, 23-12.
Bucknell won three of the matches
including apin by 150-pounder Mike
Van Doren ’92.

Bucknell bounced right back
and defeated William and Mary,27-
18. The highlight of the win was in
the 167-pound weight class when
Tom Marchetti ‘91 pinned Bill
Hagner in six seconds to set a

fastest pin was recorded by Bill
Cressler when he recorded apin in 18

Marchetti’s 36th of his career and
99th win. The win put him at 24-4

with 14 falls for the season which is
good enough to be ranked eighth
best in his weight class in the nation.

Women’s and men’s swimming
finish second and third, respectively

By Mitch Benton
Staff Writer

Both of Bucknell's swimming
and diving squads had outstanding
showings at last weekend's inaugural
Patriot League Championships. The
women's team set five school records
and finished the competition trailing
only champion Army, 565.5-551.5.
The men's team came off their
disappointing season, in which they
finished 1-10 on the year to trail only
Fordham and Lehigh.

Leading the women's team,
which finished the season 6-4, was

‘garet Grunow ‘93, who was
rugner-up by one point to Army’s
Cdilleen Criscillo in the competition
fog Outstanding Female Swimmer.
Grunow won two individual events
over the weekend, the 100 (53.08)
and 200 (1:53.37) yard freestyles,
and teamed with co-captain Kelly
Appler ’91, Kathleen Hartnett ’94,
and Andrea Falcione ’92 to establish
school records in the 200-yard medley
relay (1:50.02). Harnett, Grunow,and
Falcione combined with co-captain
Carla Banashek ’91 to win the 400-

yard medley relay in a school record
time of 4:01.23.

Falcione placed second in the
50-yard freestyle in 24.08, making
her the second-best performer in
Bucknell history. Harnett trailed
Falcione in the event, placing third,
and followed that performance with
a new school record in the 50-yard
backstroke (28.20), while swimming
the lead leg in the 200-yard medley
relay.

The men’s squad tallied 591
points over the weekend, 80 points
behind Fordham and 26 behind
Lehigh. They, too, were led by the
outstanding performance of a
sophomore, Jay Gross, who also
finished second in the battle for
Outstanding Swimmer. In addition,
Don Steenson ’92 tied for fourth for
this award, while Rick Hutchinson
’91 finished eighth.

Gross recorded one of the
Bison’s numerous pool records in
the 50 yard freestyle, with 21.06, the
third best score in Bucknell history.
Gross also won the 100-yard butterfly
(50.84) and teamed with Steenson,
Kevin Schroth ’92 and Dietrich

Conze ’94 to place second in the 200-
yard freestyle relay. The same team
with Chad Farrell ’92 replacing
Conze came in second in the 400-
yard medley relay, before winning
the 200-yard medley relay. Their time
of 1:34.97 was the school’s second-
best ever.

Steenson eared his ranking
by taking two individual events, both
in times ranking second in school
history. His first win came in the
100-yard backstroke (51.80), while
the second came in 200-yard
backstroke (1:53.66), whichalso gave
him Fordham’s Lombardi Pool
record. Hutchinson, one of
Bucknell’s co-captains, swam the
school’s second all-time best in the
400-individual medley, which placed
him third in the meet. He also finished
fourth in the 500-yard freestyle.

While both squads were led by
many outstanding individual
performances, both coaches cited
total team efforts as the key to success
at the Championships. All 17 of the
women entered and 16 of the 17 men
scored points in the event. Gross and
Grunow led the squads in scoring

with 57 and 56 points, respectively.
The championship marked the first
time that that many Bison swimmers
had ever scored in league
championships (the team competed
in the East Coast Conference
Championships, before switching to
the Patriot League this year).

Many of the swimmers’ times
qualified them for competition in the
Eastern Championships to be held at
Princeton next weekend for the
women and Feb. 28-March 2 for the
men. Schroth, Farrell, Steenson and
Gross will team together again for
tworelays, while Steenson and Gross
also qualified for individual
competition. The women will also
send a relay team to Princeton. The
foursome of Hartnett, Appler,
Grunow, and Falicione will compete
inthe 200and400-yard medley relays
as well as the 200 and 400-yard
freestyle relays. Individually,
Falcione and Grunow also qualified
for the 50 and 100-yard freestyles,
while Hartnett will be in the 50-yard
freestyle and the 100 and 200-yard
backstrokes.

of 35-9. Bucknell was victorious in
eight of the ten matches.

The Bison victories in three of
the last four matches came in the
wake of their matches on Friday the
15th and Saturday the 16th against
Delaware and Drexel. While Ferraro
would not comment on specific
upcoming matches, he seemed
optimistic based on the team’s
performance of late. In the next two
weeks, the Bison will head to Central
Connecticut and Hofstra, and Ferraro
believes that Bucknell has the ability
to win the remaining meets this
season. “I feel good about our chances
of winning all four meets,” said
Ferraro. “We want to gear things
towards our national schedule so that
we will be ready for our conference
schedule,” including the ECWA
Championships at Drexel and the
NCAA Championships at Iowa.

Ferraro added that the team
would pursue its original goals from
the start of the season, which include,
most importantly, winning the
conference. With victories in the
upcoming matches, the Bison could
conceivably accomplish this goal.
Obviously the most important and
difficult match in the tournament will
come against Rider. “With a victory
against Rider we can still make
nationals,” Burns commented.
“People are dropping weight for the

Rider match. Chris Doukas (‘91) will
be wrestling at 126. People are
making sacrifices.” Individually,
Ferraro would like to see the team
have at least two All-Americans,
Presumably, Marchetti, Burns, or
Ken Herceg ‘91, could end the season
in the top ten in the country. Burns is
also currently ranked eighth in the
nation and Herceg is 23-8 with 11
falls.

Despite a record of 4-12, the
Bison grapplers remain optimistic
after victories in three of their last
four matches. With four close
matches coming up, Bucknell
wrestlers look to improve theirrecord
to 8-12, while setting their sights on
the conference championship.

Hockey continues its
unpredictable season

By Jennifer Walsh
Staff Writer

In the world of college
athletics, playing a club sport can be
a pretty unpredictable experience. If
you happen to play club ice hockey
for Bucknell, the case may be
extraordinarily so.

If you do indeed play ice
hockey for Bucknell, you may, for
instance, find yourself and your
teammates having to push a broken-
down Zamboni off the ice before
you can start a game. You may find
yourself trying to skate through more
than an inch of “snow” over a rut-
scarred ice surface that is supposed
to serve as your home rink. You may
have to settle for not getting proper
respectand having game’s cancelled
on you at the last moment. Or you
many find yourself setting a bounty
on an opposing team’s obnoxious
head coach.

All of the above were the
colorful events that set the scene for
the Bucknell hockey team during the
successful month of January in which
they accumulated a modest record of
five winsand only one loss, including
two very impressive late comebacks
against teams from Bloomsburg and
Dickinson.

Playing a newly-adopted,
physically-intimidating style, the
team took advantage of their
aggressiveness as well as a schedule
laden with home games in order to
create their victories.

“We got off to a really good
Start,” said team co-captain Carl
Zuckerberg ’91, “but lately we’ve
been having alotof problems getting
enough guys together for games.”
Asaresult, their record has suffered.

During the month of February,
Bucknell’s hockey team has gone
just 1-3, their only victory coming
from a forfeit by Johns Hopkins
University on Tuesday. Itis a farcry
from January’s performance, in
which the team’s only loss came on
the night of the broken-down

Zamboni incident, which left the ice
insuch poor condition that Bucknell’s
skating ability was useless. However,
that problem may soon be rectified
with the very real possibility that
Bucknell will be building its own
skating rink on campus.

Aside from that, the team’s
already-hurting offense was further
impaired by the loss of its previously
leading scorer Ben Johnson ’94, who
had totalled three goals early in the
season before going down with a
dislocated thumb and shoulder.

And to compound their lack of
goal-scoring, Bucknell has also had
to deal with troubles in the area of
goaltending. “Our goalie [Alec
Ultman °94] has been a little shaky,”
remarked team member John
Guelcher GR. “But that’s mostly
because he hasn’t played in four years,
and that’s one thing that most other
teams scem to have this year, really
solid goaltending.”

Guelcher now finds himself
leading the team in scoring with four
goals and eight assists, while
teammate Jamie Abrahamson °93
leads the team in goals, with eight.
He is second on the team in total
points with cleven.

Yet despite all the team’s self-
criticism, the players do give
themselves credit for having at least
a few really strong points.

“We play very well together as
a team, and we have a lot of good
young players to work with,”
commented Zuckerberg.

Aside from that, Bucknell’s
current record of 6-4 is good for
“about second place” in the league,
which is not bad considering that the
top four out of the nine teams that
make up the league will enter the
playoffs for the Tournament
Championship.

But for Bucknell, the toughest
problem they might have in making
the Tournament will not be either
goal-scoring ornetminding; they may
have to worry the most about just
staying out of the penalty box.

Team members Brad Houston
*93 and Bob Hauser ’93 have cach
received two game misconducts
resulting in ejections, and the entire
team has taken more penaltics this
year than last season. But from the
players’ perspective, the fault is not
their own, but the fault of the
referees.

“We've been really unhappy
with the officiating this year,” agreed
both Zuckerberg and Guelcher. “But
the penalties are partly the results of
playing a more physical game.
Hopefully, it won’t hurt us and we
can still make the Tournament.”

“We'll need to come up with
a very strong finish,” add Guelcher.
“All of the rest of our games will be
big games—the league is really tight
this year.”

But for now, the hockey team
will be concentrating on the games
in the immediate future. This
afternoon, Bucknell will be facing
off against a talented squad from
Loyola, and the hockey team will be
playing their last home game of the
season on Monday.

“Loyola should be tough, but
beatable,” said Guelcher. “They
have a couple of really good
individuals, but they’re weak
defensively, and they don’t play
really well together.”

However, the Johns Hopkins
match should be an even tougher
one for Bucknell. Like Loyola, Johns
Hopkins has several very talented
players, but they are having trouble
working as a team. Yet unlike
Loyola, Johns Hopkins is a proven
strong checking team, which could
be a problem for Bucknell’s ailing
offense.

They have already stated a
clear wish for vengeance upon
Loyola, threatening to set a bounty
on Jeremy Altman, Loyola’s
infuriating head coach.

“It should be a pretty
interesting game,” said Zuckerberg.

If you’re a woman over 35, be sure to schedule a mammogram.

In which case, you need more than just

Breakin’ Bison win third straight

By Kirk Peters

Bucknell’s men’s basketball
squad increased its current winning
streak to three games with a 69-51
thrashing of Army on Wednesday
night in Davis Gym. The win lifted
the Breakin Bison’s overall record to
15-10 and put them in a third-place
tie with Holy Cross in the Patriot
League at 5-3.

The game featured two vastly
different halves. In the first half,

Bucknell jumped out to an 8-0 lead
behind a Mike Bright °93 three-
pointer and one-handed jam and
another three-pointer from Bill
Courtney ’92. After this strong start,
however, Army began to control the
tempo with a deliberate offense and
physical inside play.

“We got out to an eight point
lead and we thought we were going
to shoot it out. You can’t do that
against somebody as physical as they
are,” remarked head coach Charlie

Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian

Bill Courtney ’92 goes up for a one-handed slam dunk in the first-half

Bison track teams
remain undefeated

By Scott Brown
Staff Writer

With the Patriot League
Championships coming up in just
eight days, both the men’s and
women’s track teams will hope to
continue their winning ways. The
men’s team has been flawless in its
four scored meets while the women
have recorded two wins in two
attempts. Lynette McBride 91 was
pleased with the women’s effort so
far this season. “I think we’ve done
all right, but the true test will come at
conferences,” she said.

The men _ had several
spectacular performances in their last
competition, the Bucknell Winter
Classic, last Saturday. In a field of
over twenty teams, the men were
able to win three events and two
Bison ran times that will qualify them
for the IC4A’s. In the 60-yard high
hurdles, Jean Simon ’94 finished just
ahead of Mark Barolo ’93 in atime of
7.6 seconds. That time is the second

best by arunner in the Patriot League
this season.

Norbert Berenyi ’91 continued
to run well in the mile and finished
first with a time of 4:08.8, which
qualified him to compete in the
IC4A’s. The performance was
Berenyi’s career best and the fifth-
best mile time in Bucknell history.

The Bucknell two-mile relay
also won with a time of 7:58.7. Matt
Deardorff ’92 ran the three-mile race
in 13:59.7, which only placed him in
second but was still good enough to
qualify him for the IC4A’s. In
addition Paul Austin ’91 finished
second in the shot put witha throw of
49°-5 3/4””, just four inches shy of his
career best. The throw was the best
throw by anyone in the conference
thus far this season.

The women ran tenaciously as
well, winning eight events. The
highlight was McBride’s first place
time in the 60-yard dash. Her time of

Woolum.

Dave Ardafiyo led Army’s
charge with ten points, and seven
boards in the first half. Mike Bright’s
ten points for Bucknell kept the Bison
close and they went into the locker
room with a 26-24 deficit.

“We knew they were going to
be deliberate,” said co-captain Keith
Fenton ’91. “We played well enough
defensively, but we were too
impatient when we got the ball on
offense. Athalf-time, we talked about
being more patient and getting better
shots.”

The half-time strategy proved
effective as the Bison exploded in the
second half. Two free throws and a
three-pointer by Fenton knotted the
score at 29, Then, over the next
seven minutes, the Bison went on a
17-2 run to which all five starters
contributed. Two threes by Fenton
and a thunderous dunk by Bright
highlighted the rally.

After taking a 48-33 lead,
Bucknell never looked back. Mike
Bright had a tremendous all-around
game with 16 points, three rebounds,
three assists, two blocks, and seven
steals. Keith Fenton finished with 13
points, all in the second half. Patrick
King, in yet another solid effort,
collected 14 points and 10 boards.

While mostof the students were
beginning their classes back in
Lewisburg, the Bison were learning
ACC basketball in Winston-Salem,
NC, After a quick five point run to
start the game, Bucknell found itself
down 43-26 at the half.

Wake Forrest's bigger and
faster athletes, such as ACC Rookie
of the Year to-be, Rodney Rogers,
built up its lead to as much as 29
points.

"He's everything thateveryone
says he is," commented Woollum at
the post-game press conference.

The Bison, led by Courtney's
31 points, managed to cut the Deamon
Deacon's lead to only nine with just
under three minutes to play,
beforeWake went on a 9-2 run to
close out the game 83-67.

Since returning north, the
Bison are playing some of their best
basketball of the season as they head
down the stretch. The team has
rebounded from some early
conference losses, including a tough
one to Fordham and a heart-breaker
at the buzzer to Holy Cross. The
Bison avenged that earlier loss to
Holy Cross last Saturday as they

defeated the Crusaders in
Massachusetts during their winter
homecoming.

The back-court trio of
Courtney, Fenton and Peyton
combined for 50 points including a
career high 13 for Peyton. Foward
Mike Bright was named the game‘s
MVP by Holy Cross officials for his
17 point, ten rebound, four steal
performance. This marked the first
time a non-Crusader had received the
honor.

Bucknell kept the momentum
going witha 98-81 victory over Mount
Saint Mary’s on Monday. Bill
Courtney tallied 30 points in the
victory and Keith Fenton tieda school
record with five three-pointers.

The Bison led from tip-off to
final buzzer. Co-captains Courtney
and Fenton tallied 48 points on 12 of
19 shooting from the floor. Pat King
and Paul Olkowski ’93 pulled down
eleven and seven rebounds,
respectively. Point guard Malik
Malone 91 chipped in five point in
just two minutes of play.

Defensively the Breakin’ Bison
held their opponents to under 40 per
cent field goal shooting for the second
straight game. Only tomorrow’s
opponent, Fordham, has a better
defensive field goal percentage in the
Patriot League. Before each game,
the chalkboard in the team’s locker
room reads “Defense is the key to our
success.”

While the defense has
contributed significantly to the team's
success, the Bison lead the Patriot
League in scoring offense.

Tomorrow, the Bison will try
to keep their winning streak alive in
the Bronx against Fordham. The
Rams are undefeated in conference
play. The Bison, however, are not
intimidated. ““We’re finding different
ways to win. The team is starting to
come together,” remarked Fenton.

Lady Bison fall to West Point

Women try to get back on track this weekend against Fordham

By Dave Riggs
and Todd Bianchine
Staff Writers

The women’s basketball team
suffered another tough defeat last
Wednesday as they took a 72-52
drubbing at the hands of Army led
by three players who scored in double
figures. The loss drops Bucknell’s
record to 2-19 with a 1-7 record in
Patriot League play.

Army jumped out to a 6-0
lead and never looked back. Paced
by a dominating offensive attack in
the paintand anextremely aggressive
man-to-man defense, Army
exploited the young backcourt of
Bucknell, who turned the ball over a
total of 30 times throughout the game.

The Lady Knights’ tenacious
play led them to a 43-28 halftime
margin. Army was sparked at the
midway point by Jennifer Hankes
who came off the bench to score ten
points. The turnovers were the
difference at this point. Only
Bucknell’s 53 percent field goal
shooting was keeping them in the
game.

Army went on an 10-0 run
early in the second half getting 6
points from Hankes and four from
Christine Chandler. The Bison
continued to turn the ball over and
also began to get cold from the file.
They only connected on seven of 26
shots in the second half.

“They werea really big team,”

said Kelly Dee 94. Dee led the
Bison with 20 points and four steals.
“No matter how much pressure we
put on their guards they were able to
throw it into their big people and it
was just too hard for us to defend. I
think once we went to our full court
Pressure we were a little more
successful, but we may have waited
too long to do it.”

Earlier in the week the Lady
Bison lost a close game to Canisius
74-70, despite an 18 point
performance from Julie Bachman
GR. Bucknell trailed Canisius at the
half 37-27, and were able to pull to
within six points down the stretch,
but just couldn’t come up with the
big play after Juliet McGee ’93, who
had 15 points for the game, fouled
out with three minutes left to play.

Again Bucknell was plagued
with poor shooting and turnovers.
The team shot just 33 percent for the
game and have 21 turnovers. Dee
chipped in with 14 points in defeat.

“Everything was in our favor,”
said coach Lori Howard, “we had
more rebounds, shots, steals, but we
just didn’t shoot well. It’s hard to win
games when you only shoot 33
percent from the field.”

“Right now our goal is to get
out of the basement in the
conference,” she added.

Martin Luther King, Jr. preached

to Bucknell commu

By Sue Basalla
Staff Writer

Asa partof the guest preacher
program, Martin Luther King spoke
in Rooke Chapel on April 23, 1958.
Although described in the April 17,
1958 Bucknellian as “one of the
most admired religious leaders of
the world in a recent gallup poll,”
King was billed on the chapel
program as simply the President of
the Montgomery Improvement
Association (MIA).

King organized the MIA in
order to co-ordinate the
Montgomery, Alabama bus protests.
This 381-day boycott of the bus
system stemmed from Rosa Park’s
now-famous refusal to sit in the
“black” section of a public bus.

The protests resulted in the
desegregation of Montgomery’s
public buses and the MIA later
evolved into King’s Southern
Christian Association.

Focusing upon religion rather
than civil rights, King delivered a
sermon entitled “The Three
Dimensions of a Complete Life” at
the weekly Wednesday morning
chapel service.

The May 1,1958 issue of the
Bucknellian summarized King’s
speech as calling for the integration
of personal fulfillment, altruism and
spirituality.

Vandalism plagues campus;
DeCerchio ponders causes

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

According to Vince DeCerchio,
director of security and safety,
incidences of campus vandalism have
riseninrecent months. The noticeable
increase frustrates DeCerchio, who
is unable to determine reasons for the
growing number of vandalisms. “We
have a higher
incidence of
vandalism on
campus than
usual,” he said.

poe te
campus
vandalism
comes primarily
in two forms: broken windows and
falsely activated fire pull stations.
The most recent examples of
vandalism occured over the weekend.
“There were quite a few windows
broken just last weekend,” said Bob
Millward, manager of buildings. In
addition to breaking windows,
vandals tore down two plexiglass
signs in the Bertrand Library.

The cost of vandalism may be
what affects students the most. “I
would say vandalism at Bucknell runs
about $15,000 to $30,000” ina period
of nine months, Millward estimated.
Millward said partof the University’s
budget includes money to cover
vandalism. However, the budgetary
figure covers less than a third of the
costs incurred by vandals each year.

As incidences of vandalism
increase, the cost of repairs “has to be
tacked on to the yearly operating cost
of the university and it has to be
tacked on to students’ tuitions and
benefits and resources,” said
DeCerchio.

The cost of replacing broken
windows, acommon form of campus
vandalism, varies. Replacing small
window panes runs about $11,
including labor. On. Jan. 15, vandals
broke four large plate glass windows
outside the Boswick dining hall of
the Langone Center. Millward
estimates that to replace each broken
pane will cost $850, for a total of
$3400.

Without knowing the motives
which lead to acts of vandalism,
DeCerchio finds it difficult to reduce

itself can really change people,” he
said.

“We'd have a better chance of
resolving these types of problems if
we really gotat the source. Whatis it
that causes people to do that?” he
said. DeCerchio suggested that
resentment of authority, being away
from home, and alcohol abuse may
be at the source of the problem.

“It’s become kind of a pasttime, coming
back to the dorm at two or three in the
morning and pulling the fire alarm.”

—Vince DeCerchio

One thing that statistics do
clearly indicate, however, is that “the
majority of cases involve
underclassmen - freshmen and
sophomores - who are intoxicated,”
said DeCerchio.

DeCerchio cited a study done
by Cornell University about 10 years
ago which revealed that most campus
vandalism, throughoutthe nation, has
been committed by students under
the influence of alcohol. The same

seems to be true today on Bucknell’s
campus, according to DeCerchio.
“There’s a statistical basis for
connecting alcohol to vandalism and
I’m concerned about it,” he said.

DeCerchio also said he
wondered “whatitis that affects these
people so that when they get drunk
they become destructive. I think that
as they get older they may want to
examine that
behavior.”

DeCerchio
classifies a large
numberof incidents
as “very angry
vandalisms.” He
cited, as an
example, one
student who tossed “‘a rock or a brick
through a large plate glass window of
the [Langone Center].”

One of the most common types
of vandalism comes in the form of
falsely activating pull stations, which
alert security of the possibility of a
fire, as well as the expending of fire
extinguishers for apparently no
reason.

Phi Psi dealt ultimatum

Alumni must raise $150,000 by May 1 to keep house

By Bob Ritter
Staff writer

The nearly three-year battle
among the Bucknell alumni of Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity over whether to
sell the Pennsylvania Gamma chapter
house to the University will be
resolved by the end of the current
semester.

As_ the
long-running
battle among
Phi Psi alumni
inand outof the
courts winds to
a close,
fraternity
representatives
are also
beginning their
efforts to
recolonize the chapter.

Paul Pigman ’56, president of
the Phi Kappa Psi Alumni House
Corporation, acknowledged this week
that the alumni group wishing to block
the sale of the house to the University
has been granted a final extension on
their deadline to raise $150,000 for
the house’s restoration.

Following a campus meeting
of the two sides Monday, Pigman
said that the House Retention
Committee “‘is insisting on another
60 days to raise the money” demanded
by the Corporation to halt the sale.
With thenew May 1 deadline, Pigman
admitted, “I have no faith we have
any chance to get ready [for
occupancy] for the fall.”

Pigman explained that
“negotiations are complete, and
Bucknell is patiently waiting until
the Alumni Corporation decides what
it’s doing” tosign anagreement which
would turn ownership of the house
over to the University at a repair cost
not to exceed $350,000.

Barry Maxwell, vice president
for administration, said that under
the best circumstances “it is
conceivable” that the house could be
occupied next fall, but “that would

depend on how quickly forces were
mobilized, and how quickly the [Phi
Psi] decision is conveyed” to the
University. If the common areas were
completed by September, but the
residential rooms were not yet
available, Maxwell said it was
“unlikely that anyone, Phi Psi or
Bucknell, could occupy part of the
house” while construction continued

“If you own something you take better
care of it, you respect it, it becomes a part
of you. If the University owns it it just
becomes a boarding house.”

— Dale Shuggart ‘69
House Retention Committee chairman

in other areas.

Negotiations were repeatedly
held up during the last two years as
Phi Kappa Psi national and individual
Penn Gamma alumni attempted to
take the Alumni Corporation to court
to block the sale.

As a result of the court action,
the Alumni Corporation has set the
May | deadline for the group to have
“a minimum of $150,000 in the
bank—not pledged—in the bank,”
Pigman explained. He “suspects they
will” fail in their efforts, and believes
that “we may very well know by
April 1” that the group will be unable
to raise the necessary funds.

Dale Shuggart ’69, chairman
of the Penn Gamma House Retention
Committee, explained that the drive,
which “started justovera month ago,”
has netted $30,000 in pledges to date.
Shuggart said “it is impossible to
tell” if the effort will be successful,
although he does believe “most people
favor keeping [the house], it’s just a
question of whether the money is
there.”

He explained that the House
Retention Committee’s plan calls for
the money raised to cover “about half
the repairs,” and to be accompanied

by “a continuing fund raising effort
over the next two years,” while
“everything else would balance out”
financially if the house is fully
occupied.

Colonization efforts begin

When the chapter was closed
in 1988 the University declared that
the group would be allowed to
reorganize this past fall; because of
the intra-chapter
squabble and the
present overhaul
of the social/
residential
system, the
Starting date was
pushed back to
the beginning of
this year’s fall
semester. Ron
Richard, Phi
Kappa Psi director of chapter services,
explained that officials from the
national office will be on campus “to
recruitan interest group...throughout
the spring.”

Richard, who is “very positive”
about the effort, added, “I think we’re
going to have a lot of success.” He
explained that the fraternity was not
allowed to have any contact with
students until the beginning of this
semester, although several students
had contacted the Office of
Residential Life to inquire about the
chapter.

Richard held an informational
meeting with these students on Feb.
13 to explain the upcoming process
and because “we wanted it to be clear
we are founding a brand new group.”
He wanted to hold the meeting before
the end of rush to give ample
opportunity to students “who decide
they wanta more traditional fraternity
experience,” rather than helping to
recolonize the chapter

Richard explained that a
“national leadership party” will be on
campus for an “initial process [which]

takes about three weeks,” and

Academic dishonesty increases

Faculty, administration view problems as minimal

By Bob Minnich
Staff Writer

The number of academic
dishonesty cases for this semester
has increased marginally but not by
enough to cause alarm according to
Larry Shinn, vice president for
academic affairs. The Board on
Academic Responsibility reported
that a total of 67 cases of academic
dishonesty were addressed first
semester.

The mostcommon offense was
the signing of false statements by
students. Forty-one students charged
were found guilty and received as
punishment a course grade reduced
by one-third.

Other cases of academic
dishonesty involved cheating on

“the majority of cases involve underclassmen...who are intoxicated.”

lab reports, inappropriate
collaboration irresponsibility, and
plagiarism. Of the nine incidents of
cheating on exams, one student was
found not guilty, one received a zero
for the exam and consultation with
Psychological Services, and one
received a class grade lowered by
one grade letter. Three individuals
were given a “W” for their course
grades.

The Board of Review on
Academic Responsibility is the
University’s official body which
decides whether the students charged
are guilty or innocent of any charges
of academic irresponsibility. Three
faculty members and two students
comprise the Board. The faculty
members are elected by Bucknell’s
Student Government (BSG) for
Staggered three-year terms. The two
Student representatives are chosen by
the BSG. The disciplinary process
involves the Board, the student, the
professor, and the deans of the college
ofarts and sciences and the college of
engineering.

In assigning penalties, the
Board of Review considers
precendents set by similar cases. Itis
assumed that repeated offenses result
in increasingly severe punishments.
The Board may assign punishments
froma listranging from the rewriting
of an assignmentor exam without the
lowering of a letter grade to the
permanent expulsion of the guilty
student from the University.

Despite the cases of cheating
and plagiarism, faculty members
indicate that academic dishonesty is
the exception among Bucknell
students. Ralph Droms, assistant
professor of comuter science,
acknowledged “We don’t spend a lot
of time worrying about academic
dishonesty among the students. We
don’t spend a lot of time devising
mechanisms to avoid academic
dishonesty problems.”

Droms did, however, exper-

ience academic dishonesty within one
of hisclasses. A student handed in an
assignment that was obviously not
the student’s own work. Droms
indicated that this incident was rare,
stating that “I haven’t changed
anything that I’ve been doing based
on this one problem.”

Martin Sklar, professor of
history, said thatacademic dishonesty
has “rarely beena problem.” Bucknell
students are “intelligent and honest.”
Sklar stated that he encourages a
“collaborative effort and interchange
ofideas” as important for scholarship.

Maureen Murphy, associate
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, remarked that “there’s a
need for awareness of the issues of
what is involved with academic
responsibility.” Murphy remarked
that cheating is not frequently

Vandalism

From page 1

When vandals expend fire
extinguishers without cause, they
endanger the lives of others around
them, according to DeCerchio. Fire
extinguishers cannot be recharged
immediately, leaving a hall vulnerable
to fire until the following morning.

Even more of a concern to
DeCerchio is the “unbelievable
amount” of falsely activated pull
stations. Between Jan. 1 and Feb. 5.,
security responded to 32 false alarms
in residence halls.

“T’m afraid to talk about them.
Sometimes when you talk about a
problem and you note that it is a
problem, for some reason .some
people get really egged on to do it
more,” he said, justifying his
hesitancy to discuss the issue.

Although in the immediate
picture, the false alarms are simply a
nuisance to residents and to security,
danger comes when students choose
to ignore fire alarms which might be
signalling a real fire. “The problem
with false fire alarms is that after a
while people ... become conditioned
to the fact thatthere area highnumber
of false fire alarms and after a while,
occupants of a residence or a
dormitory won’tevacuate anymore,”
said DeCerchio.

Rather than evacuate the
building each time the alarm sounds,
DeCerchio says some students put on
headphones or go back to sleep. Some
even wait until they see smoke, he
said, which is dangerous because
smoke alarms will detect smoke long
before students would be able to see
it.

As with other types of
vandalism, DeCerchio attributes the
activation of pull stations to
intoxicated students. “It’s become
kind of a pasttime, coming back to
thedorm attwoor three in the moming
and pulling the fire alarm. I’m sure
that persons who do itmay notalways
have malicious intent; they think
they’re funny,” he said.

Students who are caught
activating pull stations will be turned
over to the police for arrest and
prosecution. Persons who commit
other campus vandals are dealt with
by the University judicial system,
DeCerchio said.

In addition to problems with
broken windows and activated pull
stations campus vandalism has taken
other forms as well. “People drive
their cars all over campus,” said
Millward.

Also, DeCerchio pointed out a
problem with people shooting BB
guns at windows. He referred
specifically to an incident which
occured on Feb. 3 in which a BB
punctured the windshield of a car
parked outside Smith Hall

Millward spoke of other minor
vandalisms, such as the breaking of
vending machines.

In December, USA Today
reported Bucknell as having the
highestcampus crime rate in the state
per 1,000 students. Vice President
for Administration Barry Maxwell
and DeCerchio called the report
misleading because it counted
vandalism and petty thefts, which
other universities may not have
included in their crime statistics.

From page 1

involves “one-on-one interviews with
interested parties” to determine their
suitability for “the kind of fraternity
experience we want to offer.”

Richard was unconcerned
about the possibility that the house
may not be livable by. September,
explaining, “Certainly we consider
the chapter separate from the house.
Weare notrecruiting to fill the house.”

Sale triggers alumni dispute

The sale of the house has been
an extremely controversial issue
within the ranks of the Penn Gamma
alumni, and was the cover story of the
Fall 1990 issue of The Shield of Phi
Kappa Psi, the national alumni
magazine.

In that article, a poll of Penn
Gamma alumni revealed that 97
percent of those surveyed preferred
to have the alumni corporation retain
the house, while only three percent
supported the sale of the property to
Bucknell.

The national fraternity attacked
the transfer cost, which it estimated
as four percent of the house’s actual
replacement value, as “giving [the
property] to the University.”

This is essentially the case, as
Maxwell explained that the Alumni
Corporation would transfer title
without compensation to the
University, which would then pay for
all repairs necessary to make the
property available to the new Phi Psi
colony.

Maxwell said that the
University has estimated it would
have to spend $335,000 to complete
repairs on the house; healso explained
that the Physical Plant estimate is
from fall 1988, and would probably
have to be scaled upward.

According to Maxwell, a
number of repairs are needed to bring
the property to University standards
because the current condition of the
house is due to a slow process of
deterioration which includes “damage
done by theactives at that time [1988],
coupled with damage from neglect
{in upkeep] and problems over the
last two years” in which the house
was unattended.

Inan interview last fall, Pigman
justified the sale by explaining that
“Bucknell will be able to manage the
facility in a more prudent manner”
because administrators are in close
daily contact with the fraternity, and
“it was the [unchecked] behavior of
the students that caused the whole
problem in the first place.”

Shuggart believes that keeping

the house in the control of the
fraternity is essential because “if you
own something you take better care
of it, you respect it, it becomes a part
of you. If the University owns itit just
becomes a boarding house.”

While acknowledging that “I
understand where they [the Alumni
Corporation] are coming from,” he
believes that a repeat of the problems
which led to the loss of the charter
could be prevented by amore attentive
alumni. He said, “Most of us feel that
if you’ve got a group of people who
have graduated and done well, they
can do something to supplement the
University. If we stay closer, maybe
we can enhance the educational and
social opportunities of the
University.”

The national organization has
charged that the proposed agreement
offers no firm guarantee that the
chapter can occupy the house. Phi Psi
chapters at Stanford University and
Dickinson and Franklin & Marshall
Colleges have lost their houses
because their property transfer
agreements did not contain explicit
renewal options.

In the Shield article, the
executive council said that the
University could remove the house
on four months’ notice if it decides
on a non-residential use, and that
there is no renewal option following
the initial ten-year lease. Pigman,
however, explained that Phi Psi’s right
to the house can only be revoked by
a vote of the Board of Trustees.

Legal battles delay action

The Phi Kappa Psi house has
been closed since May 18, 1988, when
the national organization revoked the
Penn Gamma chapter’s charter
following repeated disciplinary
problems. Pigman and the Alumni
Corporation first approached the
University about purchasing the
house the following fall, but
negotiations were halted when other
Penn Gammaalumni went to court to
block the transfer of the house.

The legal hurdles were cleared
in August of last year when a petition
byaPennGammaalumnus todissolve
the Alumni Corporation was
dismissed by the courts.

The national executive council,
originally a party to the suit, continued
to support the action after it was
dismissed from the petition in March
1989, when Union County Common
Pleas Judge James F. McClure ruled
that the council had no legal interest
to initiate the action.

Dishonesty

From page 1

intended, and referred to the “heat of
the moment” in an act of academic
dishonesty. The pressure does not
excuse the cheating; students must
recognize this pressure and plan their
time better so that any pressure may
be minimized.

Larry Shinn, vice president for
academic affairs, echoed Murphy’s
comments concerning the scope of
the academic dishonesty issue. Shinn
says dishonesty is a concern for two
reasons. First, “honesty is at the heart
of what we assume when we enter
academic covenants with students.”
“The lifeblood” of the University
involves “‘a free exchange of ideas”
resting “upon the pillars of honesty
and free speech.”

The second issue involves
university funding from agencies.
Shinn mentioned that Bucknell
instituted a formal procedure of how
to deal with academic responsibility
last year in order to receive research
funding from the National Institutes
of Health.

In response to the problem, the
University community has altered
certain practice to stress the
importance of honest scholarship.
Shinn stated that there is now a greater

stress about academic dishonesty at
orientation and an increased attempt
to define academic dishonesty in the
Student Handbook. The faculty is
also clarifying cases of what they
consider acceptable within their own
classes.

Shinn said that incidents of
plagiarism and cheating are always a
concern but that “there are marginally
more cases, butnot enough toconcern
ike

Trudy Cunningham, associate
dean of engineering, linked the
problem at Bucknell with the larger
problem faced by all college
campuses.

Cunningham said that Bucknell
does not experience as much
academic dishonesty as other
campuses, but the cases that do occur
disturb the sense of community.
Professors consider incidents of
cheating a “personal offense.”

Cunningham characterized
Bucknell’s academic disciplinary
system as “more educational” than
those of other universities. The goal
is to educate the student to the
seriousness of the incident and to
ensure that the student will remain an
honest member of the Bucknell
community.

Environmental lawyer
to discuss Clean Air Act

By Julie L. Shurilla

Environmental issues have
been brought increasingly to the
forefront of our awareness, and
environmental laws will affect
people in industry and business as
wellas those involved in politics. In
his lecture entitled, “Policy and
Political Implications of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990,”
attorney Jeffrey Miller will discuss
the effects of new environmental
legislation. The lecture, which is
sponsored by the Environmental
College, will take place at 7 p.m. on
Monday in the Gallery Theatre in
the Langone Center. It will be
followed by a reception at 8 p.m. in
the Faculty Lounge.

Jeffrey Miller, an
environmental lawyer, is currently
a professor at Pace University
School of Law, one of the leading
institutes for the study of
environmental law. A graduate of
Harvard Law School, Miller has
worked for various private law firms
and for the federal Environmental
Protection Agency. He has
published a book and several articles
on environmental law issues, and
he has become one of the most
respected authorities on
environmental law.

Last fall, the Clean Air Act

Amendments were a hotly debated
issue. The amendments will produce
an immeasurable effect on the
environment. According to Stephen
Stamos, professor of international
relations, the amendments will also
havea tremendouseconomic effect.
Stamos said that the cost for
businesses to adhere to the new
amendments could be enormous,
although the degree of its influence
on our economic system could be
minimal. Penny Puskarich ’92, a
junior fellow with the
Environmental College,commented
that this legislation is a test of
President Bush’s campaign
promises to address environmental
concerns. Since the Carter
administration, Puskarich said, there
has been almost no action on
environmental issues from the
executive office. Environmentalists
hope that increasing awareness of
these issues throughout the U.S. will
lead toa greater amountof protective
legislation, but there is some doubt
as to how effective that legislation
will be.

Miller’s lecture will focus on
the political impact of the 1990
amendments, and the reception will
provide an opportunity for students
and faculty to talk personally with
him about Pace University and the
field of environmental law.

DeCerchio, students draft
alcohol enforcement policy

By Tommy Abel
Staff Writer

Vince DeCerchio and the
Student Security Advisory
Committee have completed their
revisions of Bucknell’s new Alcohol
Policy Enforcement Procedures for
Special Events and Social Activities.
This new policy addresses many
aspects of such events, including
event registration, the enforcement
procedures, the nature of the
complaints and violations check
sheet, reasonable cause to enter an
event, and a statute of limitations
regarding the filing and disposition
of charges.

DeCerchio commented that he
“built this draft within the context of
reasonable guidlines from a security
and police viewpoint.” The revised
policy is the resultof studentconcems
over equitable and fair dealings
between the University organizations
sponsoring social events in which
alcohol is served.

DeCerchio sent the original
draft of the revisions to 14 student
leaders and campus organizations.
DeCerchio stated, “I senta memo out
to all student organizations, the IFC
officers, and to most of the
administrative departments asking for
their input and for their participation
with the advisory committee.”

Each then returned the draft,
including their input and criticisms,
to DeCerchio. After receiving their
comments, he met with the Student
Advisory Committee to finalize the
draft. He believed student input would
help ensure the validity of Security’s
proposal.

And he added, “Every member
of the community agreed that the
guidelines were reasonable.” Under
the new rules, on the night of an
event, security will perform two
checks: one between 11 p.m. and
midnight and another between 2 a.m.
and 3 a.m. When the security officer
arrives at the event, he or she will
request to see the “event sponsor or
organization officer.” The event
sponsor will then accompany the
officer to the segregated area “where
the officer will evaluate the area,
occupants, and monitor.” As in the
past, alcohol service is to stop at 2
a.m., all indoor music (live and
recorded) is also to stop at 2 a.m., and
the event should be completely
concluded by 3 a.m.

While, the above situation
refers to a fraternity-type party, the
policy clearly states that “the same
enforcement procedures will apply
to all student-sponsored events
serving alcohol, including residence
hall events.”

DeCerchio’s new policy also

defined ‘reasonable cause’ for the
Bucknell community. DeCerchio
stated that “those guidelines are ones
used by most police departments.”
He went on to state that he believed
the problems of the past were due to
“unfortunate breakdowns in
communication.”

Again, the definition of
reasonable cause was created by
DeCerchio in conjunction with other
student leaders and organizations.
Reasonable cause is defined in six
parts as follows:

1. To respond to a fire alarm or
fire emergency.

2. To respond to a physical
plant emergency.

3. To respond to an excessive
overcrowding situation.

4. To respond to a crime in
progress, acrime which has occurred,
or activities indicating that a crime
occurred or is occurring ataneventor
in a house.

5. To respond to a disorderly
conduct situation or inappropriate
behavior visible from outside the

event or house.

6. If an event sponsor or
organization officer is unavailable to
respond to a problem or complaint.

A statute of limitations
concerning the filing of complaints
and violations was also created in
response to students’ requests for
swift and accurate reporting of all
charges. All complaints will now be
written-up at the time of the event
and will be given to the event sponsor
or organization officer at that time, or
atthe earliest possible time following
the violation.

A copy of the charge will then
be delibered to the Office of Student
Life on the next business day. A
hearing will be convened within seven
business days to dispose of the
charges. All defendants will be
notified of complaints as soon as the
charge is filed with Security or
Student Life.

Commenting on the
introduction of these procedures
DeCerchio remarked, “I think we’re
making excellent progress.”

Bush rejects
Soviet proposal

President Bush said Tuesday
that Gorbachev’ formula for the Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait is
inadequate. Bush did not outright
reject the letter, but sent a detailed
response to Moscow. He did claim,
however, that the formula “falls short
of what would be required” to end the
war with Iraq.

Baghdad did not publicly reply
to Moscow’s formula for ending the
war. Tariq Aziz, Iraq’s foreign
minister, reiterated the proposal
Baghdad announced last Friday to
withdraw from Kuwait. He again
listed the conditions allies have called
unacceptable. Aziz called Friday’s
offer “a serious step on which we still
insist.”

Aziz is expected to return to
Moscow on Wednesday. Until an
official response comes from
Baghdad, allied forces may decide
nol to engage in ground combat. The
Soviet Union’s foreign minister,
Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, warned
that a ground war could complicate
matters.

Bush said the negotiations
would have no effect on the war. “As
far as I’m concerned, there are no
negotiations. The goals have been
setout. There will benoconcessions,”
he said.

Yeltsin demands
Gorbachev’s
resignation

Inanationally televised address
Tuesday night, Boris Yeltsin,
president of the Russian republic,
called for the resignation of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
Yeltsin reminded the Soviet people
of Gorbachev’s “tendency toward
political power.”

After much negotiating to
establish a time for Yeltsin to appear
on nationwide television, he delivered
a speech which ripped into the Soviet
president and his “anti-people
policy.”

Yeltsin also asked the Soviet
Public to support his demands that
the Kremlin power be turned over to
the Federation Council, which is
dominated by republics Striving to
secure independence.

Yeltsin called for Gorbachev's
resignation after the leader relied on
traditional Kremlin support and
military might to maintain control in
States leaning towards self-
sovereignty. Last month, Gorbachev
defended the use of army tanks in
Vilnius where 15 armed persons died
while demonstrating for Lithuanian
independence.

I.R.A. bombs hit
London stations

Two bombs, placed by the Irish
Republican Army (1.R.A.), exploded
in a central London railroad station
Tuesday, killing one man and
wounding 40 others.

One bomb exploded at 7:40
a.m. in Victoria Station, crowded with
commuters headed into the city from
London’s southern suburbs. The
bomb had been hidden in a trash can
and sprayed glass and shrapnel when
it exploded. Another bomb had
exploded several hours earlier in
Paddington station, but caused no
casualties.

Government officials say the
recently increasing threat of IRA
terrorist acts marks an intensification
of the group’ sattemptsto force Britain
out of Northem Ireland. Tuesday’s
bombings, which caused the first
civilian casualties inflicted by the
organization in seven years, came
Just 11 days after the mortar attack on
10 Downing Street which missed
Prime Minister John Major and his
war cabinet.

Drug makers
refuse discount

Congress recently passed a law
which requires that Medicaid be given
the same discounts drug companies
grant to other businesses. Rather
than reduce the rates of drug prices to
Medicaid, drug companies have
chosen to circumscribe the law by
drastically raising the prices of drugs
they sell, even to big customers.

Large prescription drug buyers
have sometimes negotiated 25 to 60
percent reductions in prices from
suppliers. In the lastdecade, however,
Medicaid, the federal-state health
program for indigents, has paid
significantly more for prescriptions.

Drug makers have increased
the price of prescriptions, affecting
such groups as the Department of
Veterans Affairs.

The new law, which went into
effect Jan. 1, requires drug makers to
offer state Medicaid programs the
lowest price charged to any of their
customers. The Congress Budget
Office estimated in October that
discounts to Medicaid would save

the federal government $1.9 billion
over five years. Itestimated that states
would save $1.4 billion in that time.

States debate
governor terms

Vermontand Rhode Island, two
of three states which still hold
gubernatorial elections every two
years, have renewed debates over the
length of governors’ terms.

One former Vermont governor,
Thomas Salmon, claims two years is
not a long enough term; governors
barely settle into the office before
they must begin campaigning again,
he said. “You've got to have time to
do strategic thinking and planning and
two years is a tiny time frame to deal
with major issues,” he said

Others argue that the short terms
keep governors in touch with voters.
One advocate of the present two year
term said that the issue would be
resolved by better planning on the part
of the governors elected.

A change in term lengths in
either state would require a

constitutional amendment which
includes both legislative approval and
a voter referendum.

Congress may
cut spending

Congress will have to cut
spending on domestic programs to
offset the costs of new benefits for
veterans of the Persian Gulf war,
Richard Darman, director of the
Office of Management and Budget,
said Wednesday.

Darman told Congress that it
will have to find means of financing
new benefits for the veterans, His
warning may limit Congress's
enthusiasm for generous new benefit
programs designed to show support
for the troops in the Middle East.

If Congress does not come up
with alternative funding for these new
programs, the budget law, signed by
President Bush on Nov. 5, would
require across-the-board cuts in many
domestic programs such as Medicare,
farm price supports, and guaranteed
loans for college students.

Tribal art included in Gallery exhibit

By Ted Sterling

Wandering down the short
corridor on the third floor of the ELC
to the entrance of the Center Gallery,
there is a sense that one is entering a
different and exciting world. This
effect is achieved by the assorted
religious and spiritual artworks from
several South American countries that
are seen on both sides of the hall.
There is much more in store, though,
for those who pass through the doors
of the Gallery, forthe South American
works are only the preliminary step
in a journey through place and time.

Just before entering the gallery,
one reads a quote by Carl Jung which
states, “All cultures have tried to
record the immemorial. Because there
are innumerable things beyond the
range of human understanding, we
constantly use symbolic terms to
represent concepts that we cannot
fully comprehend.” These words are
the basis for the current exhibit in the
Gallery entitled “Divinations —
Transcendent Images from Africa,
South America, and the United
States.”

Stepping into the gallery, one
stands before an assortment of
contemporary artwork by various
American artists. On the opposite
side of the gallery, enclosed in glass,
is the heart of the exhibit. Here is a
wide range of tribal and ritualistic art
from Africa, what has historically
been labeled “primitive” art.
However, in recent years it has been
argued that the word “primitive” is

eer

This is a unique exhibit in the
respect that the art comes from so
many different places and times.
According to Metzger, the common
thread between all the works, alluded
to in the words of Jung, lies in the
shared values of all the artists
including “the search for beauty and
order in life, personal communal
prestige, [and a fascination by] the
mystery of death,” among others. In
a few cases, one can even see the
influence on contemporary U.S.
artists by their humanistic
predecessors in Africa.

The African pieces, mostly
ceremonial statues and masks,
represent only “the tip of the iceberg
of the brilliance of African art,” says
Metzger, who also believes that “‘the

‘Master Harold’... and the
Boys to be performed tonight

Black History Month festivities include intense drama

By Laura Grisin

The Asolo Theatre Company
will present ‘Master Harold’... and
the Boys, an award-winning play by
South African Athol Fugard, tonight
at 8 p.m. in the Weis Center.

This powerful drama centers
around Hally, a white South African
boy, and the two black tea-room
waiters, Sam and Willy, who work
for his parents. The servants have
established a significant relationship
with the boy as surrogate fathers since
his natural father is hospitalized as a
crippled alcoholic.

The relaxed atmosphere
suddenly turns tense when Hally hears
that his father is returning home from
the hospital. He dreads the inevitable
clashes that will result, and, unable to
vent his confusion and anger at his
father, he lashes out at Sam, thereby
jeopardizing one of his most
meaningful friendships. As described
by Frank Rich of The New York Times,
what occurs is “an unstoppable,
almost unwatchable outpouring of
ugliness, in which Hally humiliates
the black man he loves by insisting
that he call him ‘Master Harold,’ by
mocking their years of shared secrets,
by spitting in his face.” He adds that
the play is written so that “you don’t
know you’re entering the center of a
storm until you’re there.”

Setin South Africa in 1950, the
play is “already a classic, though
very contemporary and timely,” said
William Boswell, director of cultural
events. “It presents a compelling
perspective not only on relations
between races, but between adults
and children and people in familial
relationships.”

The play’s presentation
coincides with the annual celebration
of Black History Month. The
playright, Athol Fugard, has spurred
anger and resentment both inside and
out of Africa and has occassionally
been described as a spokesman for
black South Africa.

“‘Thave been told thatas a white
man, I cannot fully comprehend or
appreciate what black reality is,” said

Fugard in an American Theatre
article. “To write about another man’s
reality if he’s got black skin is no
greater challenge to my imagination
than to write abouta woman’ s reality.
People who judge me in any other
way are dismissing my work because
of the color of my skin, not the quality
of my imagination.”

This production of ‘Master
Harold’... and the Boys is part of a
ten-and-a-half-week tour that will
bring the Asolo Theatre Company to
28 cities in 14 states. Founded in
1960, Asolo was originally created
by Florida State University asa theatre

festival and has since toured the
United States, including four
performances at the Kennedy Center
in Washington, D.C.

Today, actor Daryl Edwards,
who plays the role of Sam, taught a
class of theatre games and exercises
for interested students. In addition,
he discussed the current political
landscape of South Africa and how
events there relate to ‘Master
Harold’... and the Boys.

Campus cultural offerings expand
with the Bucknell Opera Company

By Lisa Spodak

If you walked through the
Langone Center during lunchtime
last week, you may have heard
something totally unexpected mixed
in with the noon chatter—Opera.
Well, those people sitting at the
table with the video were members
of the Bucknell Opera Company,
and if you stopped to listen, you
may have been surprised at what
you heard.

Todd Griffith, the acting
manager of the company, told me
that “many people have
misconceptions about opera.” They
think thatall operas are heavy Italian
undertakings that were written a
hundred years ago. What they don’t
realize is that there are also many
modem American operas and that a
lot of them are funny. The Bucknell
Opera Company “strives to present
a variety of styles of opera,”
according to Dr. Catherine Payn,
director of the company. For
example, Douglas Moore’s
Gallantry is standard soap opera
material, complete with a hospital,
doctors, a love triangle and
commercials.

Griffith also pointed out that
many people who like musicals don’t
realize that they would probably also
enjoy opera. Trouble in Tahiti, an
American opera, was composed by
Leonard Bernstein, the same man
who composed the music for the
popular Broadway show and movie
West Side Story.

It was in response to student
interest that the Bucknell Opera
Workshop was transformed into the
Bucknell Opera Company. The
company meets once a week and
members receive a quarter credit for
their efforts. Griffith was quick to
add that anyone can join, not just
music majors. “Most people think
you have to sound likean opera singer
to join the company, but that’s not so.
It’s a lot broader than people think,”
he said. “Dr. Payn incorporates all
different voice types and kinds.”

The scenes which the company
produces for its performances are not
simply showcases for operatic
singing. They are chosen for their
dramatic content and character
development, and members have the
Opportunity to act as well as sing.
“The Opera Company is a good
experience for theater people because

opera is as mucha theaterexperience
as it is a musical experience,”
Griffith said. When the company
meets, Dr. Payn coaches them not
on vocal production, but on
characterization; she then mects
individually with people to work on
vocal production.

The Bucknell Opera
Company had its most recent
performance last Saturday in Rooke
Chapel. They performed five scenes
from the American operas of four
composers. The scenes were from
Leonard Bernstein’s Trouble in
Tahiti, Aaron Copland’s
Tenderland, Gian-Carlo Menotti’s
Amahl and the Night Visitors, and
Douglas Moore’s Gallantry and
Ballad of Baby Doe. The
performance will be repeated Mar.
16 at 2:30 p.m. in Bucknell Hall.

The Bucknell Opera
Company’s spring production will
be acomplete one act opera entitled
The True Story of Cinderella,
composed by Warren Martin. The
May 4 show will also consist of four
scenes from Mozart operas,
including the first work that the
company will be doing that is not in
English.

Gallery Series presents Urban Diva

By Ally Kambach

The Unseen Honesty Problem

All faculty and administrators at Bucknell need to visit an optometrist! Too many are blind to the extent of
academic dishonesty which occur at Bucknell. The time has come for Bucknell to enact a Honor Code to alleviate the
problem caused by the current lax system.

During the past semester, the number of academic dishonesty cases has increased to 67 cases which made their
way to the Board of Review on Academic Responsibility. Numerous others never made it to the Board because they
were handled by individual faculty members, and worse still, most violations are never even uncovered. Clearly 67
is a gross underreporting of the problem; the captain of the Titanic probably thought he was at first encountering an
ice cube rather than an enormous iceberg

The administration denies that academic dishonesty is an acute problem at Bucknell Perhaps they really are
that naive, or maybe they are trying to protect the reputation of the University. In either case, the status quo has clearly

failed to provide an adequate deterrent to cheating

Most Bucknellians do indeed uphold the ideals of academic honesty, but a substantial minority does not
Students know that cheating pays off. The chances of getting caught are minimal and the punishments often negligible
For these reasons, students often procrastinate and then find themselves plagiarizing, collaborating inappropriately
or cheating. Too many go unpunished

An honor code would reduce the instances of academic dishonesty in two important ways. It would, by
necessity, educate students about the punishment associated with dishonesty. When students have to sign swom
statements after taking exams or writing an essay, they will at least be reminded that acts of dishonesty will be
punished. Secondly, it would require that students report any cases of academic dishonesty of which they are aware
Reporting will increase the chances of catching those who cheat, and the policy should go a long way to erase the
“snitch” syndrome. It should be the duty of students to report cases of dishonesty to maintain the integrity of their own

work.

Some people argue that an honor code would make Bucknell a “cut-throat” school. If the administration were
to draft a code which allowed a fair degree of collaboration while clearly defining the bounds of acceptable behavior

this would simply not be the case. An honor code can adequately stifle cheating while at the same time allowing for

the free communication of ideas.

Moreover, the success of honor codes at schools such as Haverford, Smith, and William & Mary is testimony

to the deterrents created by such policies

It is time that the administration reconsidered instituting an honor code at Bucknell. In the meantime, the faculty

should be reminded that every ume they let students off easily, they are encouraging the continuation of this problem

If the University is really serious about giving students: more responsibility, why not make them more

responsible for their own actions?

LEMWERS TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor:

Since January 16th and even
before, political theorists and social
analysts all over the world began
their deliberations on determining
the “origins of the War in the Persian
Gulf,” yet one needs go no further
than the Bucknellian editorial pages
to pinpoint the exact dilemma in the
United States today.

Referring to Ms. LaMaire’s
letter to the editor, “Faith helps
overcome war worries,” while each
individual has the right to her or his
own religious beliefs and
perspectives, certainly the success
of any republic would be in question
if each of its citizens were content to
sit back and watch as others decided
their fates for them (which,
assuredly, others would be willing
to do).

As for Mrs. Oltorik’s letter to
the editor entitled “Parent urges
Sojkatolimitactivities of S.T.O.P.,”
S.T.O.P. recognizes thatmany share
Mrs, Oltorik’s view and would be
glad to see the prohibition of S.T.O.P.
and its activities. But think of all the
lives that were saved by the end of
the Vietnam War that was brought
about by the protest and opposition
of that anti-war movement. Or the
rights that women and people of
color now enjoy because of the
strength and force of the civil right
movement. Clearly, the quality of
life and protection of freedom that
Mrs. Oltorik enjoys, as all of us
enjoy, owes itself to the courage and
strength of those who have raised
their voice of dissent in the past. For
these reasons, S.T.O.P. will continue
its anti-war activities. And whereas
some displays or activities may be

S.T.O.P. responds
to readers’ views

seenas “offensive” to some, perhaps
what is more “offensive” is the
general acceptance and disinterest
that many in our community seem
to have as the lives of hundreds of
Iraqis are wasted everyday.

Citizens must question
govemmentand make it responsible
for the potential consequences of
its actions. $.T.O.P. formed with
the initial goal of informing itself
and the campus about the Persian
Gulf War. We wanted to open
dialogue and discussion about the
questionable legitimacy and
hypocrisy of fighting a war in the
Gulf.

Afterthe careful research and
discussion, $.T.O.P. is convinced
that the government is inundating
the American public with inaccurate
“facts” and information of
questionable truth. S.T.O.P.’s
activities have been numerous and
controversial, but the objective was
to oppose the war. The Bush
Administration has rushed into this
war too quickly; alternatives were
not given the time needed to work.
Basically, $.T.O.P. refuses to
believe that the use of brute force is
the only option: “Why do we kill
people who kill people to prove that
killing people is wrong?”

Recently, President Sojka
sponsored a “Day of Reflection and
Discussion.” Eight faculty members
spoke on topics and considerations
related to their areas of expertise.
There were, at the most, thirty
students there and at least half of
them were S.T.O,P. members. How
does the rest of the campus feel?
Why is there so little interest in the

To the Editor:

Soon after the performance by
the British vocal group Electric
Phoenix last Friday night at the Weis
Center, a letter was hand-delivered to
the Center. Although the author chose
to remain anonymous, the unsigned
letter raises important issues. I hope
you will see fit to print excerpts and
my responses contained herein.

The letter states in part:
“Having great appreciation for Arts
and Music, I must say that I’ve never
before been subjected to such
deranged ‘entertainment’. Although
the few people who were able to
tolerate the performance would argue
that it was an expression of man’s
artistic nature and a display of the
range of human vocal capacity, the
wide majority in attendance viewed
it to be senseless noise and gibberish,

and a waste of their time and money.”

I find it gratifying that the
author of this complaint had such a
strong reaction: there are many who
feel strongly that it is the duty of an to
create in the observer/audience an
emotional response; that too many
are too complacent about art; that as
a society we need more art that
challenges, educates, uplifts,
awakens, and, yes, even disgusts us.
Art should make us feel and think,
not lull us with the predictable and
familiar. Life is notall happiness and
comfort, and art, if it reflects or
intensifies life, can likewise notall be
beautiful. As a reaction to art, anger
may not be pretty, and I suppose it
can be dangerous if misdirected, but
it’s preferable to apathy.

To neglect the opportunity of
the Weis Center challenging its

audience would reap the same
consequence as Bucknell only
booking uncontroversial speakers and
lecturers: this would be a dull place
and legitimately open to extreme
criticism for neglecting itseducational
responsibilities.

We are not in the business of
defining or dictating taste, and I hope
I made it clear before I was hired to
my position that I have no interest in
presenting to the lowest common
denominator or scheduling only
events which will appease and appeal
to the largest possible audience. It is,
however, exigent to offer
opportunities for expansion of artistic
horizons. For some this means
exposure to the classics, for others it
may mean introduction to what is
current. What is paramountin making
descisions about presentations on the
Weis Center Series is quality, and
Electric Phoenix is, to my my mind,
unquestionably one of the best groups
doing the kind of music they do. 1am
Not at all sorry we presented them;
I’mnotsorry that some of the audience
left at intermission; I am sorry that
more people didn’t give themselves
the chance to have the experience
and react.

Let me go no further without
saying that I, too, did not like some of
the concert, though admittedly my
reaction wasn’ tas strong. Still, loften
prefer challenging, even maddening,
musical experience to being pacified
by concert performances of elevator
music. Nobody says I have to like it,
but I am a poorer person for having
denied myself the chance to decide. I
am often surprised by what I take
away from unusual artistic
adventures, especially if I can leave

my preconceptions, and bad moods,
at home.

To more concretely respond to
some of the letter’s implied criticisms,
let me note that there were those who
enjoyed the performance. Electric
Phoenix was on campus for a four-
day residency in the Department of
Music, and I am told it was a
wonderful experience for the students
lucky enough to work with them. It is

Does ROTC belong at Bucknell?

The university should not recognize “a training ground for killers.”

By George M. Jenks, collection development librarian

The issue of ROTC has been with Bucknell and the nation for many years. ROTC was established by the
National Defense Act of 1916 to provide officers for the Army.

Why is it inappropriate for Bucknell to carry our the Army’s objectives?

First, there is the matter of discrimination. The Army discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation and
gender. Bucknell’s stated policy forbids this. ROTC cadets could find that after four years in ROTC, their
commissions would be denied.

Second, the University does not have the same control over the personnel of ROTC as it has over other
programs. We let the Army appoint, evaluate and fire its personnel on out campus. Programs approved by
Bucknell should support Bucknell’s mission. The Army uses ROTC for its purposes, not Bucknell’s.

Third, and the most important reason is that the Army is a training ground for killers. This may sound like
emotional rhetoric, but we must face reality. That’s what armies do: kill and destroy. The tools used by the Army
have only two purposes: death and destruction. They persuade in the gunslinger tradition of the Old West.
National defense is the euphemism most often used to cloak the Army’s actions. Of the many wars we have
fought, few were defensive. We were attacked in the Second World War. The Mexican and Spanish-American
wars were naked aggression on our part. Our incursions into other countries, form Mexico to Nicaragua to Haiti
to Korea to Iraq and several countries in between, were to maintain our interests, not to defend ourselves.

On the other hand, the University is a place of ideas, dedicated to discovery, discussion and debate, to the
force of argument, not the force of arms. Such an organization as ROTC, because of its peculiar way of imposing
its will, has no place ina university. We should not serve as a military base. I hope that Bucknell’s values do not
include killing as a policy-making tool.

Some say that, by training future officers at a university, rather than at the professional school at West
Point, we can expose them to liberating and civilizing influences. This may be true (though unproven), but using
this logic one can justify any program at Bucknell, the more reprehensible the better.

Others say that ROTC scholarships enable students, particularly lower-income and minority, to attend
Bucknell who might otherwise be unable to. It is not clear that this is true. Even if it were, this is acynical view
that says that the end justifies the means, and is institutional prostitution, a Faustian bargain of which we should
be deeply ashamed.

Someone said that my motion to sever our ties with ROTC was in bad taste because of the war in which
we are engaged. I wonder if bombing Baghdad is in good taste?

“There is a role for a university such as ours in providing well
trained, educated and responsible officers...”

By Michael Chiaruttini ’93 and Brian Selmeski ’92

Since 1981, the Department of Defense has subscribed to a policy whereby homosexuals are prohibited
from military service on the grounds of “incompatibility,” despite a lack of evidence to this end. ROTC has
complied with this policy by only commissioning heterosexual men and women as Army officers. Homosexuals
are clearly denied some of the benefits of the ROTC program. We consider this policy to be indefensible, and
as Mr. Jenks points out, it is in direct conflict with Bucknell’s non-discrimination clause. However, we do not
believe that it is ground for severing university ties with ROTC.

One reason is the high level governmental review of this policy currently being conducted by the General
Accounting Office (GAO). It would be most unfortunate to end the mutually beneficial relationship between the
Army and Bucknell, if in the near future this policy may be reversed. Those who believe that such an action would
“send a message to the Pentagon” are sadly mistaken. This is not the first challenge to this policy. In fact, this
type of discrimination has been upheld as legal in the Supreme Court. Furthurmore, the Department of Defense
has made it clear that ROTC programs nation-wide will be scaled back considerably in the near future, as a result
of shrinking defense expenditures. Losing the twelve to eighteen Lieutenants Bucknell ROTC commissions
annually would mean very little in the big picture.

The other basis Mr. Jenks gave for the severance of ties was that the “mission of the armed forces is to kill
other human beings and destroy property,” which he sees as irreconcilable with the goals of Bucknell. We resent
being characterized as such, and see this as an idealistic and narrow point of view. In his analysis, Mr. Jenks has
confused the result of military action with the purpose of the military. It is important to understand that the armed
forces do not define their own mission, rather they are an instrument of a civilian government who may utilize
them in a number of different ways, of which war is but one.

The idealist is lucky, not having to confront the ugly reality that war may indeed by necessary in certain
circumstances. However, if we accept this premise, we see the obvious necessity of maintaining a military.
Contrary to what many believe, there is a role for a university such as ours in providing well trained, educated
and responsible officers, which are crucial to an effective and professional army. One need only refer to the
University Mission Statement which states that Bucknell should emphasize “the preparation of its students for
the exercise of high responsibility in all phases of society.” We find it rather pretentious of Mr. Jenks to have
decided for us, on the basis of his principles, thata liberal education should not include courses in Military Science.
To insulate the university community from the military perspective provided by ROTC would be doing the

A
Different
Drum

By Marc Haimes

When I was four years old I had
blocks. Everyone did, and they were
fun. We would lovingly make boats,
and houses with secret passages, and
airplanes. They were the settings for
countless creative action-figure
adventures.

Today four year olds have
Nintendo. A convenient TV video-
game system where kids can “plug-
in” a variety of adventures which all
seem to entail guiding a muscular
kung-fu barbarian through countless
“worlds” until he single-handedly
kills all the bad guys and rescues the
beautiful princess. Usually he has
three lives to do it. Individual games
for this system cost about fifty bucks

apopand come with colorful manuals
which graphically depict the bulging
biceps of the warrior and the throbbing
cleavage of the princess. Also,
detailed stories are presented which
set the unique scenario. . .

Welcome to the dark world of
“Steel Barbarian.” Once upon a
time there was a young Kung-Fu
Master, Bladefirm, who protected the
land of Harmonia where all the good
people of the Universe livedin peace.
But one day, when Bladefirm was out
fighting evil, the dark wizard,

negative effects of this vile machine
on children are much worse than the

accidently chucking a block through
the kitchen window. I have worked
as a swim counselor for a summer
camp’ for the past few years, and in
that short time have noticed that the
physically sedentary and mentally
stifling conditions that Nintendo
creates has caused at least three drastic
changes in children’s behavior.

1. Young children are no longer
as willing to take risks,

Perhaps in the dreamy video-
game world kids don’t mind jumping
across scorching flames or braving
enemy gunfire, but in the real world
of the camp swimming pool children
seem increasingly reluctant to deal
with non-video oriented obstacles.
When I first began teaching
swimming I remember “The
Tadpole” group as adorable
kindergartners who were delighted at
the prospect of blowing bubbles or
kicking with their hands on the wall.
However, this past year when |
enthusiastically urged the little tykes
into the pool, they preferred to run
around the deck like hyperactive

mosquitos claiming that they were
some guy named Mario who
obviously didn’t need swimming
lessons. After about a week, I was
tempted to lure the crazed vidiots
into the bath-house where I would
threaten to give them lethal doses of
Riddylin unless they, at least, put
their feet in the water. When the first
six weeks of camp concluded, only a
few of “The Tadpoles” had succeeded
in getting their bathing suits even
slightly damp. And that was just
because they drank too much Bug-
Juice for lunch.

2. Children are more violent.

It seems that during “free-
swim” kids are no longer able to play
in a non-aggressive manner. Instead
of pretending to be deep sea explorers
or agile fish, the youngsters just sort
of stand there, thinking of games that
involve blasting and killing. . .

Sammy: Boy this sucks! I
wish I was home playing Super Mario
Brothers XXV.

Matthew: Well... Ya wanna
play Sharks and Minnows?

Sammy: Why should I play
that dumb game when I have “Deluxe
Submarine Destroyer” at home!

Matthew: Well, lets make up
a game then.

Sammy: I know. We can
pretend that we’re Bladefirm and all
the Swim Teachers are Limpsies. . .
and wecan use these kickboards here
to mutilate them

Matthew: Yeah!!! Then we’ll
steal there whistles and blow them
real loud in people’s ears!

Justa few short years ago these
kids were placidly playing Marco-
Polo, and now they are running around
trying to decapitate lifeguards with
flotation devices. Later that
afternoon, Matthew told me that
“Steel Barbarian” was a lot more fun
athome because in HIS version of the
game Limpsies didn’t pull you out of
the pool and call your parents when
you attack them.

3. Children are less creative.

It seems that kids never “play
act” anymore. Many even lack the
ability to keep themselves amused
outdoors for more than a few minutes,
unless, of course, there’s a portable
“Nintendo Game-boy” around. In
Nintendo games, the task is simple

seems that kids are incapable of
playing games where they mighthave
to use their imaginations to make up
rules of theirown. Also, the Nintendo
system seems to capitalize on kiddie-
trends by turning characters such as
the Teenage Ninja Turtles and Bart
Simpson into video game stars. Now
kids can emulate their hero without
using dolls tocreate their owncreative
stories and adventures, but merely by
pressing buttons.

In risk of sounding like H.G.
Wells, Nintendo is becoming
increasingly popular and I predict a
dim future for our younger
generations as they evolve into
cowardly violent, boring people with
no sense of imagination and
overdeveloped thumbs. People who
might be more inclined to look
towards war with an “evil” enemy as
a glorified solution to all problems,
rather than attempting to create and
explore. And build. Now we
wouldn’t want our children to be like
that! Would we?

which they have collected in support
of their position.

Tam notnaive enough tobelieve
that professors have not in the past,
and will not continue in the future, to
abuse their position by using their
classroom as a forum in which to
advance their own political, moral
and religious positions. I am sure all
of us have at one time or another sat
through such sessions and felt
repulsed, angered and cheated. I feel
quite strongly that the classroom is a
forum for the dissemination of
material germane to the subject at
hand. I do not feel I have the right (no
matter how strongly I may feel) to
abuse my students and the power
entrusted to me by trumpeting
personal and political issues.

I am not advocating that
political issues are inappropriate to
discuss in political science classes or
that it is inappropriate to discuss the
environmental impact of the war in
Geology classes. In some classes I

would hope that the Persian/Arabian
Gulf issues are thoroughly discussed
from all angles and viewpoints. They
are clearly appropriate topics in some
classes when discussed in the
appropriate light. My concern is that
the members of S.T.O.P. (both faculty
and studentalike) seem incapable (or
unwilling) to make any distinctions
between whatisand is notappropriate
in the classroom. That they have no
difficulty with the first meetings of
my mathematics classes being spent
in these discussions says a lot about
their judgment. Not only is this an
inappropriate use of the classroom
from the point of view of one
perspective, but it is quite likely that
an active discussion of topics evoking
strong opinions and emotions will
polarize groups within the class.
Undoubtedly some of these group
will be alienated against the faculty
member. In any event such behavior
would affect the range of options
available in teaching the class. Were
Ia student or parent, I would lodge
complaints at the highest levels and

The Bucknellian

strongly considera transfer to another
class.

No one has said that S.T.O.P.
does not have the right to express its
views in public forums or meetings.
Nor am I asserting that current events
and diverse political views are not to
be discussed in appropriate classroom
settings. There is a line, however,
where the appropriate becomes
inappropriate, andI think most would
agree that in this case that line has
clearly been crossed. With power and
freedom there also goes a degree of
responsibility and restraint. If
responsibility and restraint are not
exercised, then the rights and
freedoms of all are endangered. It is
my feeling that this group has
perverted the nature of academic
freedom and free speech to a point
where it puts these principles at risk.

I am further outraged by the
fact that Emie Keen is the chair of the
University Review Committee. Is this
an example of whathe believes makes
a good teacher? How does he react to
those of us who do not share his

views on how we should conduct our
classes? If this is an example of his
good judgment, then what can we
expect in a difficult review case?
Were Ia faculty member coming up
for review, I would be writing this
letter with trepidation. No matter how
may verbal assurances are offered of
his objectivity, this lack of it in the
classroom speaks far louder than
words. Ernie Keen’s position will not
and has not gone unnoticed by the
Junior faculty. In the past many
students have reacted with incredulity
and surprise that political issues and
stands on University policies not in
line with the current powers to be
(whether in the faculty or
administration) can put junior faculty
at risk. Examples such as this serve
only to destroy what little faith is left.
Does the rest of the committee share
his views on teaching?

million women and men in Saudi
Arabia stand ready to sacrifice their
lives while not even one hundred
Bucknellians are willing to sacrifice

In political theory we learn
that the framers of the Constitution
held strong to the belief that the
history and policies ofa nation could
be determined by the people. The
notion of a predetermined fate was
left behind when humankind entered
the Age of Reason and
Enlightenment. As citizens we have
the obligation and duty to educate
ourselves and make our voices heard,
With rights come responsibility. At
the very least we have the
responsibility to get involved and
stay involved with the War in the
Gulf. We owe it not only to the
women and men fighting this war,
but also to ourselves.

Bison Tales

By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

So the question remains:
How can we obtain convenient
access to a variety of condoms
without having to face the
humiliation of buying them atthe
Convenience Store? And the
answer is... CONDOM
VENDORS!!!

That’s right. These
entrepreneurs can order their
diverse selection of condoms in
bulk and then sell for maximum
profit.

The operation would be
simple. When couples enter a
room with the intention of
eventual sexual activity, they
could place money (bills or
change) in a special “Condom
Vendor Request Envelope” TM
which they would leave outside
the door. On the front of the
envelope, they would specify the

| following information:

1.Number of condoms
| needed.

2.Type of condoms
| desired.

3.Approximate time of
fornication.

As the Condom Vendors
| make their rounds, he or she
would collect these envelopes.
Then, at the desired time, the
vendor would retum to the room,
perform the special “Condom
Vendor Knock” (Shave and a

Haircut), and slip the correctnumber
of condoms under the door.

For those of you who are a bit
more spontaneous in your bedroom
activities, do not fret; justkeep your
ears open. As the Condom Vendor
strolls the halls he or she will perform
the following “Condom Vendor
Jingle:

- sing to the tune of “Piano
Man” by Billy Joel

Oh, I'll help you stay protected
I’m the Condom Man. .. .

YesI’ll give yousome rubbers
for cash.

Oh were all in the mood for
some romance.

But if you’re not careful, you
could develop a rash. (Harmonica
Solo)

Copyright 1991

Now keep in mind that this
would only be the chorus. The verses
could go into greater detail as to the
benefits of ribbing and lubrication.

What’s that you say?!? This
idea is ridiculous?!? We should put
condoms back in the Convenience
Store and let STUDENTS MAKE
TH. EE ECR: Oe WwW ON

Of all the nerve! Next you’ll
be demanding that they be put in the
bathrooms!! How awful!!!

Well, it’s getting late and I
have a long trip ahead of me. I’m

Collegiate Perspective) Multiculture Cent

By Peter Lalos
Staff Writer

After months of intensive
undercover investigation, “The
Collegiate Perspective” will this
week explore the currentcondition
of the historically controversial
independent system of Bucknell
University. This often volatile
coalition, whose mere presence on
campus has been steadfastly
denounced by members of the
university’s faculty as of late, has
even more recently come under
fire due to allegations of elitism,
sexism, anti-intellectualism, and
excessive individualism within
their ranks. Events in this situation
came to a rather ugly head last
week when a member of a campus
fraternity attempted to be
deactivated from his organization,
only to be denied admittance into
the independent system by an
overwhelming vote from
independent brothers and sisters.
The dispute is to come before a
university hearing committee in
early March.

Even before the fallout over
the independent system’s latest
abuses of power, there were cries
from independents that their entire
system was being made the target
of a seek-and-destroy mission by
members of Bucknell’s faculty,
administration, and Mary
MacIntosh service; indeed, it is
swiftly becoming apparent that an
anti-Independent movement is
rapidly gaining momentum on
campuses across the nation.
Tomorrow evening, the Inter-
Independent Council plans to hold
a public forum in the Vaughan
Literature auditorium in the hopes
of creating appropriate channels
of dialogue for... aw, poop. This is
no way to run a column.

department: Clinical studies have

policy dictates that a student will

are Over... namely, about 0%-
25%.

*I’ve had an interesting
problem in my dorm this winter;
maybe those of you who inhabit
the more ancient buildings on
campus can identify with me. It
goes like this: the heating system
in my dorm operates in such a
fashion thatrooms on one side of
the hallway are fired up to an
almost unimaginable heat, while
the rooms on the other side of the
hall receive relatively little heat
by comparison and thus remain
markedly colder; both sides have
been like this for as long as I can
remember. Although it is a
mystery to most men of science,
thermal physicists have at least
lent it an appellation: “The Mc
DLT Syndrome.”

*Bo knows your MAC

*After taking an exam,
why is it that when you check
witha friend abouta testresponse
in order to salve your fears about
answering it incorrectly, he/she
always happened to put down an
answer different from yours, thus
making both of you nervous?
Where does the law of averages
figure into that? Maybe
Murphy’s Law is more
applicable.

*"New... potatoes”? What

Question: What office is
located on the second floor of Roberts
Hall in rooms 200 E and F?

Answer: This is the location of
the Multiculture Center, which was
established in the fall of 1986. The
center is, according to the 1991
Student Handbook “intended to be a
focal point for learning about and
developing an appreciation of the arts,
beliefs, customs and institutions of
other cultures, especially those
comprising the heritage of black,
Hispanic, and Native American
students and those of Bucknell’s
international students.” While the
Multiculture Center has expanded
over the past five years, its creation
was sparked by a student “talk-in” in
the spring of 1985.

On Friday afternoon of Spring
Weekend '85, a group of
predominantly black students and
several faculty members gathered on
the terrace in front of the Bison snack
bar to tell of their experiences at
Bucknell, and what Dean of Students
John Dunlop described in his 1986
report to be a perceived lack of
concern about the “welfare and
education of black students.” The
meeting was considered to be an
emotional one in which the rhetoric
was not only compelling but
provocative as well.

Following the “talk-in,” the
group presented a list
of goals they hoped to
achieve, one goal
being an expansion of
the support system
already in existence.
At that time, Judy
Jackson was
employed part-time to
serve the needs of both
foreign and African-American
students. While she was a strong
voice of support as well asan assertive
woman, the university needed more.
In other words, the students needed
to have a place they could go where
their concerns and interests would be

addressed.

Instrumental in the
establishment of the Multiculture
Center was Vernese Edghill ’87, a
Dana Scholar, assigned to the Office
of the Vice President for Plannning
and Administration. In the summer
of 1985, she traveled to several
campuses investigating how other
institutions addressed the needs of
minority students. What she came
to discover was that many schools
had “cultural centers” where black
students and others could turn. Upon
returning to Bucknell in the fall, she
compiled a report of her findings
and sent copies to the members of
the President’s staff and other
appropriate individuals on campus.

Aftera series of administrative
meetings, the students again
expressed the strong desire to have a
cultural center. As a result, they
presented a petition and letters of
support to President Sojka calling
for the establishment of a
Multiculture Center here at Bucknell.
Mr. Sojka agreed that there was
genuine interest and support for such
a center and soon thereafter, in
October 1986, the Multiculture
Center opened under the leadership
of Rebekah Mitchell.

The center currently serves as
the core for such groups as the
Bucknell International Organization,
The Pakistan-India Association, the
African-American Cultural Society,

Development, and Adrienne Jones,

making great strides, can serve solely

to both support and educate, but
simultaneously, each and every

before Bucknell can truly be

Track heads to conference finals

By Chris Drowne
Staff Writter

Today and tomorrow Bucknell
will try to bring home the inaugural
Patriot League indoor track and field
championship, but both the men’s
and women’s teams will have to turn
in strong performances to emerge
from a talented field at Colgate
University.

On paper, each of head coach
Art Gulden’s squads has posted top
times in eight of the 16 events.
However, Fordham has also boasted
some impressive results and should
provide each squad with stiff
competition. All runners should
benefit from Colgate’s track, which
Matt Deardorff ’92 calls, “anexcellent
running surface.”

The men’s team, which won
nine straight East Coast Conference
indoor championships before
changing leagues this year, will have
to call on its dominant distance
runners for the bulk of its points.
Norbert Berenyi °91, Jeff Loomis
*92, and Deardorff, who all helped
Bucknell to a Patriot League Cross
Country title in the fall, have
dominated these events all winter and
should provide those points.

Other areas in which the Bison
men expect to do well include the 55
meter hurdles and dash, along with
the weight and shot put. Jim Bock
"92 and Matt Barolo ’93 have posted
impressive marks in these two events.
Bock is also expected to do well in
the 200 meter.

Whenitcomes to the 35-pound
weight and shot put, Paul Austin ’91
has no peer. No Patriot League
thrower has come within two feet of
Austin in either event.

Like the men, the Lady Bison
will look to the sprints and hurdles
for important points. Karen
Shimomura °91 has yet to be
challenged by any non-Bucknell
runner this winter. Lynette McBride
"91, who is undefeated in the long
jump this winter, and Tricia Plasko
"92 are expected to score in the 55-
and 200-meter dashes.

The 4x400 meter relay team,
along with jumpers McBride, Lynda
Rose 91, Jenny Thomas 94, Dawn
Ellery 94, Jen James ’93, and Ella
Episcopo ’92 all need to contribute if
the Lady Bison are to win.

Both teams dominated last
weckend’s non-scoring home meet
against Lock Haven, Bloomsburg,
and Susquehanna, winning 21 of the
events,

Kris Deardorff ’93 leads the way in the 880-yard run as numerous
Lock Haven women follow. The Lady Bison took first place in ten

events, including the above race.

Tom Marchetti ’91

Tom Marchetti '91 is honored as Athlete of the Week for becoming the
first wrestler in Bucknell history to record over 100 wins in a career. The
Easton native got his milestone victory by pinning Delaware’s Chris
Wagner in the third period last Friday night.

His season record now stands at 26-4 with 16 pins. Marchetti is also
Bucknell’s all-time pins leader with 38.

The East Coast Wrestling Association recognized these
laccomplishments in naming him its Wrestler of the Week.

The men’s team got first place
finishes from Austin in the 35-pound
weight and shot put, Bock in the 60
and 300-yard dashes, and Loomis in
the 880 yard run.

Playing against a tenacious
bunch of skaters from Loyola
University of Maryland, the Bucknell
ice hockey team racked up its seventh
victory of the season last Friday in a
game that started out as a romp and
ended in a squeaker.

After jumping out to a huge 7-
0 lead in the first two periods,
Bucknell allowed Loyola to come
back to within two goals of a tie, just
holding their opponents off the
scoreboard long enough to hang on
for a crucial 7-5 victory. The win
boosted Bucknell’s record to 7-4,
good enough to keep the ream in
close running for a spot in the
upcoming Mason-Dixon Leauge
playoffs.

Playing their last home game
of the season, the Bison got off toa
flying start on the scoreboard as well
as on the ice. Right from the drop of
the puck, Bucknell set the tone of the
game with rapid skating and agressive
forechecking that quickly punctured
the Loyola defense.

The Bison’s first goal of the
game came off the stick of Jamie
Abrahamson 93 at 6:04 of the first
period, when a Bucknell shot from
the point found its way to the net
through a haze of players. Loyola
goaltender Justin Kistelac managed
to make the initial save, but could not
control the rebound before
Abrahamson had put the puck away
for his first of what was to be a three-
goal night, lifting Bucknell to a 1-0
lead.

With the exception of a two-
on-one play that almost resulted in a
short-handed goal for Loyola, the
Bison completely shut down all of
the opposition’ s offense for the entire
period. Loyola had a mere six shots
on goal while the Bison managed
twice as many of their own at the
other end of the ice.

“We were really pleased with
first and second periods—that was
probably the best we’ve played all
year long, both offensively and
defensively—but we kind of let up in
the third,” said Bucknell co-captain
John Guelcher ’91.

Not only did Bucknell let up in
the third period against Loyola, they
just about let go. The tight defense
and aggressive offense virtually
disappeared during that final segment,
gone with the icy wind that so
inhospitably gusted across the
outdoor rink, just about carrying the
puck off with it and freezing to death
the few brave souls who remained to

Mike Bronson 93 captured the
two-mile run, Jeff Schild ’92 the pole
vault. Greg Yocum ’94 won the 600-
yard dash in a time of 1:14.32 and
Blaine Fawcett 93 won the high jump
by clearing 6’4”,

Deardorff qualified for his third
event at the upcoming IC4A
championships with his winning time
of 4:13.6 in the mile.

Berenyi also qualified for those
championships with his 2:12.53
performance in the 1000-yard run.

Even more dominant were the
Lady Bison, who only lost one event.
McBride won the long jumpand 220-
yard dash competitions, Shimomura
and Dana Harbst ’93 took first in the
60-yard high hurdles and 60-yard dash
respectively while Ellery and
Episcopo won the high- and triple-
jumps respectively.

Other easy wins included a
5:06.65 mile by Kritin Opdyke ’93and
Thomas’s 63.2 in the 440-yard dash.
Kris Deardorff 93 cruised to victory
in the 880-yard run, while James took
the 600-yard run with atime of 1:29.7.

The women’s two mile relay
team of Gina Abraham ’93, Diana
Dittman ’92, Beth Muehl ’94, and
Kathy Wurster ’94 qualified for the
ECAC championships with their
9:30.3 time.

watch the disappointing third period.

Actually, the down-hill slide
for the Bison began in the very late
stages of the second period, when
they allowed Loyola to score the goal
which broke the shutout with only
four seconds remaining on the clock.
At the time, this seemed to hold little
concern for Bucknell, who still had a
nice six-goal cushion to ride on going
into the third. However, to the credit
of the Loyola players, they did not
fold as perhaps the Bison had expected
them to in the last period. Instead,
they took advantage of Bucknell’s
slacking off and cashed in on four
more goals to pull within two of a tie.
Loyola even pulled their goaltender
in order to put an extra skater on the
ice for the last few minutes of play in
hopes that the extra man would help
them score. Luckily for Bucknell,
the clock ran down faster than the
goals could add up for Loyola, and
the Bison managed to hold on for the
win 7-5.

Sometimes you hang on for a
win, sometimes you lose aclose one,
and sometimes you just wish you
hadn’t even bothered to show up
especially when more than half of
your teammates decided not to. The
latter was the disheartening case for
Bucknell in a game against Johns
Hopkins University this past Monday,
where the Bison were shelled by their
opponents, losing 12-2 to a team that
co-captain Carl Zuckerberg 91 said
“we could’ve easily beaten with a
full team.”

Bucknell’s depleted ranks left
them with only seven skaters as
opposed to Johns Hopkins’ twenty,
notonly enough for two full lines. To
make matters worse, only one skater
from Bucknell’s top three lines
showed up for the game.

Hopkins, a fast and physical
team, wasted no time in taking
advantage of the situation.

“We played pretty good for the
first five or ten minutes of the game,
butafter that, there was just no way,”
said defenseman Guelcher’91. “They
pretty much had their way with us.”

The game turned completely
disastrous for Bucknell as the Bison
were forced to play exhausting five-
minute shifts out on the ice with very
litle time to rest in between. Under
the circumstances, it was quite
incredible that Bucknell scored atall,
even more so that both goals came in
the third period. By that time, the
Bison must have felt like they were
skating on legs made of lead, but they
still managed to get the puck in the
net, one goal coming from Mike
McClean ’92 on a rebound, the other

in the event and Deardorff’s first place time qualified him for IC4A’s,

Ice hockey hits the skids, just
seven skaters for last two games

ona surprising shot taken by Guelcher
from inside the Bucknell blue line
that travelled at least 70 feet before
finding the net behinda stunned Johns
Hopkins goaltender.

Unfortunately for Bucknell, the
next game provided no help in the
wins column, as the Bison dropped
their second in a row, this time in a
heartbreaking 3-2 loss to Gettysburg
on Wednesday night

Again left with only seven
skaters on the team, Bucknell played
perhaps its grittiest game of the season
in a valiant effort to salvage a much-
needed victory, despite their
horrendous lack of manpower. The
Bison matched Gettysburg stride for
stride throughout the first two periods,
battling to keep the score even at two
on pretty goals from Guelcher and
John Werring '93. Werring scored
after making a nice play at center ice
to strip Gettysburg of the puck and
break in on the opposing goaltender,
where he was then able to stash it in
for his first goal of the season
Guelcher, a good puck-carrying
defenseman, deomonstrated his
offensive abilities as he took the puck
end-to-end onasolo rush that resulted
in Bucknell’s other goal of the night
But in spite of both the marvelous
individual and team efforts, Bucknell
eventually fell to Gettysburg after

allowing the game-winning goal in
the third period.

Teammate Zuckerberg pointed
to Bucknell goalie Alec Altman 94
as one of the reason for the closeness
of the game, saying that Altman had
played “‘a very good game.”

Altman himself commented, “I
think I played well—I was satisfied,
They didn’t getany easy goals on me,
and I made the saves I needed to. The
guys that did go [to Gettysburg] just
played a really great game.
Everybody gave at least 200 percent.”

But as for the guys that didn’t
go, their dedicated teammates were
highly critical.

“It just seems like some guys
have better things to do than play
hockey,” remarked Guelcher,
alluding to the fact that, while some
of the Bucknell players were truly
unable to make the last two games, a
vast majority were simply making up
flimsy excuses to get out of playing.
This, of course, isa practice unpopular
with any sports team, let alone a team
playing a game taking as much hard
work and dedication as ice hockey.

“There’s just no integrity, no
commitment,” said Zuckerberg.

Even worse, being so severely
undermanned in the past two games
has seriously jeopardized the hockey

Wrestling

From page 16

Doren, Ken Herceg °92, Marchetti,
Bums and Meyers. One of the key
points of the match occurred when
Van Doren pinned Drexel’s ‘Dan
Hrothka, ranked seventh in the nation
in the 142 Ib. weight class. Hrothka
had been moved up to 150 Ibs. for his
match in anticipation of the Drexel
second team wrestler defeating Elliot.
This, however, did not happen, and
Drexel’s strategic maneuver failed
Coach Ferraro was pleased with
the team’s effort over the weekend.
i. €am is coming on at the right
he said. “We had two very
ent matches.” The turnaround
comes on the heels of the challenging
tip to California in January where
the team was on the receiving end of
some difficult defeats. There was
some speculation that the severity of
defeats could possibly demoralize
he team. Ferraro lends no credibility
© that theory, and, in fact, says the
truth lies in the other extreme. “The
reason for our Ss at this point in
~ cause of the
non-conferen
“We are better prepared as
He feels this philosophy
spill over into the NCAA

tournament. “Barring injuries, we
will be better prepared than the
competition.”

While the grapplers enjoyed
their success over the weekend, the
big story was Tom Marchetti’s 100th
career victory. The next closest man
has eighty-nine wins, indicative of
the greatness of his achievement. As
Ferraro noted, “To win 100 is to
really distinguish yourself. It's a
great feat.” In Marchetti’s four years
in Lewisburg, the wresuer has become
one of the dominant forces in the
country in his weight class, and the
achievement puts the finishing
touches on an excellentcareer. After
the victory, the distinction was
announced over the speakers and was
followed by an extended standing
Ovation. Later, a reception was held
for the senior. As co-captain Burns
said of his peer, “After Tom achieved
All-American status sophomore year,
he became the first person at Bucknell!
to do so, the University did nothing

deserves the attention.”
The Bison grapplers are coming
offa successful weekend of w resuing

with a new-found confidence. The
team will be looking to put their
success on the line this weekend in
two tough matches against Central
Connecticut and Hofstra

Central Connecticut, according
to Ferraro, isa “strong, well-balanced
team which gets national exposure
They have had 4 or 5 guys at the
national championships in the past
We are capable of beating them, but
we will have to wrestle well.” Ferraro
isconfident that Hofstracan be beaten
as well, “depending on how well we
match up. They have no balance on
the team, and should be easier to
handle.”

Bison to face Lehigh after 1-1 wee

By Kirk Peters
Staff Writer

On Saturday night, Bucknell’s
men’s basketball team will renew its
long-standing rivalry with Lehigh
University. Once again, a team will
travel to Lewisburg from Bethlehem
and no one will know whether to call

them the Brown and White or the
Engineers. Once again, two bus loads
of Lehigh fans will make the trip to
Davis Gym (Get there around 6:30 so
that our dear friends from Steelland
won't have anywhere to sit). The
event itself will be as physical and
intense as always. The only factor
left to chance is the outcome.

Women's hoops
drops two more

By Todd Bianchine
and Dave Riggs
Staff Writers

The women’s basketball team
dropped two more games in Patriot
League play last week, bringing their
overall record to 2-21 with a 1-9
conference record. The losses put the
Lady Bison in last place in the league;
Lehigh was able to come up with a
victory over Lafayette to get out of
the cellar. Bucknell will square off
against Lehigh tomorrow at 5:15 in
Davis Gym for the last home game of
the regular season.

Bucknell took on Fordham last
Saturday, hoping to come up with a
big upset over the second place team,
but a dry stretch in the second half
ended up costing the Lady Bison the
game, 84-72. The firsttwenty minutes
of the game were evenly played
between the two squads; the biggest
lead held during the half was four
points by the Lady Rams. Bucknell
went into the locker room down by
two and with high hopes of pulling
off the upset.

“We just went back and forth
in the first half,” said coach Lori
Howard. “Nobody was able to pull
away from each other and we knew
we had a shot at winning the game.”

The second half started out
much the same as the first, with the
two teams taking turns leading the
ball game. After a Joy Sandler '92
freethrow with 8:23 left to play

brought the Lady Bison within four
points, the Lady Rams took off, scoring
the next nine points to make the score
71-58 with 5:11 left to play. Kelly
Dee *94 broke the scoring drought by
nailing a three-pointer but it proved to
be a little too late as Fordham cruised
the restof the way to take the game 84-
12.

“That scoring drought really
killed us,” said Howard, “we just
couldn’ tput the ball in the hoop, it was
like there was a lid on it or something.
If it weren’t for that lapse it would
have gone down to the wire.”

On Wednesday Bucknell took
on third place Colgate in Hamilton,
N.Y. The Lady Red Raiders were
definitely up to the challenge as they

Forward Pat King ’92 says there
is “definitely” a score to settle with
Lehigh. The Engineers (after hours
of exhausting research I have
determined that to be their official
nickname) have won the last four
meetings with the Bison. The streak
includes a victory in the semi-finals

ear’s East Coast Conference
Tournament and one on January 30
in Bethlehem.

In the encounter earlier this
season, the Breakin’ Bison stampeded
to a 45-32 half-time lead. However,
Lehigh stormed back by shooting 62
percent from the field in the second
half. The Engineers were led by
Dozie (buy a vowel) Mbonu with 18
and Bob Krizansky with 16. The
Bison got 22 from Bill Courtney ’92
and 20 from King, but shot only 35.5
percent in the second half.

The Engineers are consistently
led by the front line of Mbonu,
Krizansky, and Jay Hipps. Senior
Mike O'Hara provides a three-point
threat for Lehigh. The Bison need to
play solid interior defense and control
the boards to beat the Engineers.

The Bison should take an
emotional advantage into the game
from the pre-game senior recognition
ceremonies. Keith Fenton, Steve
Leshinski, Mike Diver, Malik
Malone, and Rob Joy will be honored.

Awinby the Bison would mean
more than just a nice finale and
bragging rights for the seniors, it
would also give them a chance to
finish in third place in the Patriot
League. Several tie-breakers are
involved, but if the Bison could beat
Lehigh and then Lafayette, they
would have a legitimate shot at the
third seed in the upcoming Patriot
League Tournament.

The Bison enter tomorrow
night’s game coming off a hard-
fought victory at Colgate on
Wednesday night. The Bison erased
a five-point second-half deficit en
route to a 70-67 victory. The win
insured the Bison their ninth straight
winning season under head coach

Charlie Woollum.

After the game, Woollum
expressed his relief to be leaving
Hamilton with a win. “The kids
played really well in the last five
minutes. We're happy about it. We
just want to get home now.”

Trailing 42-37 early in the
second half, the Bison went on a 15-
4 run to take the lead for good.
Courtney, who led the Bison with 19
points for the game, had nine points
in that stretch. Courtney was 8 for 10
from the charity stripe including some
clutch buckets down the stretch. Good
defense in the Red Raiders final two
possessions sealed the game for the
Breakin’ Bison. With Bucknell up
by two with 25 seconds left, Leshinski
forced a three second violation with
solid defense in the paint. Then, after
Courtney hit one free throw, Fenton
stole the ball from Jay Armstrong as
he was going up for a three pointer
that could have tied the game and
sent it to overtime.

King also had a strong game
with 15 points, 10 in the second half,
and 9 rebounds. Mike Bright 93 and
Paul Olkowski ’93 with 14 and 8
respectively, joined King to give the
Bison the front court scoring they
needed to win.

Theresults from last Saturday’s
encounter with Fordham were not as
rewarding for Bucknell. A scrappy
Bison team cut a 12 point second-
half deficit to 2 before finally falling
to the powerful Rams 69-63. Bright
and King led the Bison with 20 and
18 points respectively.

The Bison held Damon Lopez
to ten points, but were burned by the
outside shooting of Dave Buckner,
who finished with 16.

The Bison grapplers capped off
a successful weekend by defeating
Delaware on Friday and Drexel on
Saturday. The victories give Bucknell
a record of 6-8, though coach Bob

Breakin’ Bison top Army, 67-49

Bucknell to face #1 seed Fordham in

By Chris Drowne
Staff Writer

Behind a stifling defense, the
Breakin’ Bison shut down fifth-
seeded Army yesterday, 67-49 to
advance into the second round of
the Patriot League Tournament at
Holy Cross.

For the twelfth time in 15
post-season tournaments, Head
Coach Charlie Woollum has the
Bison in the second round.

The defense held the Cadets
to just 31 percent field goal shoot-
ing. At the other end of the court,
Bucknell shot 53 percent and built
up as much as an 18-point lead.

“We were patient on defense,
and we did not try to steal the ball,”
commented Woollum.

The only concern the Bison
had coming into the game was
whether or not Army Head Coach
Tom Miller could pull off another
post-season miracle.

As Colorado’s coach last
season, Miller took the Buffs, who
had not won a conference game all
season, to the Big Eight Conference
Finals. No such luck this time.

When Army’s leading scorer,
James Collins went down with a
knee injury midway through the
second half, the Cadets looked to
Patriot League Rookie of the Year
Dave Ardayfio for their points. But,
Steve Leshinski ’91 held him to just
eight points.

After the game, Bill
Courtney ’92 explained that the key
to the Bison win was that “we kept
our composure, we were patient,
and we played our game.”

Courtney’s 16 points led four
Bucknell players in double figures.
He was also one of six Bison to
record a blocked shot.

Following the recommenda-
tion of the University Council,
President Gary Sojka has decided
that the University should not take a
policy position on the construction
of a hazardous waste incinerator in
Gregg Township, in northern Union
County. Sojka, however, did make it
clear that other organized units of the
University are free to articulate a po-
sition on the controversial project.

While Sojka has publicly ad-
mitted “real serious personal con-
cerns” about the impact of the pro-
posed project, he believes the critical
issue at stake is not the incinerator
itself, but whether “Bucknell should
have a stance, and who should make
the decision what it is.” Defining the
question as “‘a matter of figuring out
how to proceed,” Sojka highlighted
the University’s inclination “for
procedure, and protecting the rights
of the individual” in his emphasis
that “any of the entities” on campus,
such as the faculty, the students or
the support staff who wish to take a
stand “should feel free to do so.”
Sojka admitted that he “would wel-
come discussion on the floor of the
faculty, and I would participate in
that discussion as part of the fac-
ulty.”

Explaining the complexity of
choosing a broad position for the
University, Sojka asked, “What does
it mean if you [as an employee] feel
different,” since the University has
no overall structure to determine the
opinions of the community’s mem-
bers. As an example, Sojka ex-
plained that, in a faculty vote, dis-
senting votes are still recorded,
while the University does not have
such a vehicle available to it.

Sojka also questioned the ef-
fect of a University decision on the
issue, questioning whether there is

University declines to take
position on incinerator issue

Sojka encourages campus-wide discussion

“more or less impact if Bucknell
does it” than if several groups take
independent stands against the
project. He also expressed con-
cerned about the impact on future
issues, saying, “If you start a prece-
dent, its worrisome.”

Charles Sackrey, associate
professor of economics and an active
member of Organizations United for
the Environment (OUE), the citi-
zens’ group opposing the incinera-
tor, believes that the University has
already set a precedent. Noting that
ale

the Board of Trustees voted in 1986
to divest from companies doing
business in South Africa, Sackrey
said, “On the level of political issues,
its perfectly analogous. In principle,
what’s the difference?”

Like the apartheid contro-
versy, Sackrey called the current
question “a decision to join a politi-
cal struggle on one side instead of
the other. There have to be things in

Insurance companies
force new BYOB policy

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

A “Bring Your Own Booze”
(BYOB) policy will be in effect at
Bucknell as early as next semester,
according to Denis Maguire '93,
president of the Inter-fraternity
Council.

“It comes right down to li-
ability. Each national fraternity is a
corporation that needs to be insured.
The direction which lawsuits are
going means that all fraternities are
becoming liable for all guests,” said
Maguire.

Ed Dadez, associate dean of
residential life, explained that the
push to BYOB is a result of the risk
management policy of Fraternity
Insurance Purchasing Group (FIPG)
and pressure from nationals. Eleven
of the twelve fraternities in IFC are
under FIPG or similar risk manage-
ment policies, said Dadez. The
FIPG risk management policy man-
dates: “No alcoholic beverages may
be purchased through the chapter
treasury nor may the purchase of
same for members or guests be un-
dertaken or coordinated by any
member in the name of or on behalf
of the chapter. The purchase and/or
use of a bulk quantity of such alco-
holic beverage, i.e., kegs, is prohib-
ited.”

Dadez explained that if frater-
nities violate this policy, although

Students, faculty, and admin-
istrators discussed the future of the
Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) program at Bucknell in two
public forums this week. Discussion
focused primarily on the military’s
policy of not allowing homosexuals
into the armed forces and the finan-
cial impact of losing ROTC schol-
arship money if the University sev-
ers ties with the organization.

Lieutenant Colonel Thomas
Maclver, head of the University’s
ROTC program, addressed the issue
of scholarships, stating that ROTC
scholarships pay 80 percent of a
cadet’s college tuition and fees. At
Monday’s forum, Maclver stated
that ROTC pays over $600,000 an-
nually to Bucknell, money that pro-
vides scholarship funds to students
who have agreed to enter the armed
forces after graduation.

Richard Skelton, dean of en-
rollment planning and a ROTC
graduate, added that while 44 of the
63 Bucknell cadets receive financial
aid from ROTC, only six get
supplementary forms of aid from the
University. The cost of replacing the
potential loss would be approxi-
mately $75,000. He saidthe loss
would be a “drain” on the Univer-
sity. Skelton expressed concern that
the loss of any student because of the
inability to replace scholarship funds
would hurt middle income families
the hardest. The diversity of the stu-
dent body would be diminished if
any ROTC students had to transfer
for financial reasons and, according
to Skelton, Bucknell could not re-
place them with students of an equal
academic caliber. Skelton said he
“feels that the loss of any student is.
irreplaceable.”

The second major issue ad-
dressed at the public forums was the
Department of Defense’s policy
against admitting homosexuals into
the armed forces. Susan Zingale,
assistant director of residential life
for developmental programs, said
that she and other members of FLAG
(Friends of Lesbians and Gays) be-
lieve that the Defense Department
policy is a “blatant act of discrimi-
nation.” Zingale said that despite the
policy, FLAG does not advocate

they will be covered, they will most
likely be sued by their insurance
company if a claim is made. There-
fore, nationals are exerting a great
amount of pressure because they
“are very serious about limiting their
liability in alcohol situations.”

Maguire noted that “some
houses are getting more pressure
than others,” and that “nationals are
being patient” for a ime.

New energy system lowers
campus electricity costs

By Timothy Amman

Bucknell has recently in-
stalled a new $500,000 cogenera-
tion unit saving the University an
estimated $200,000 per year in en-
ergy costs by using excess steam to
generate electricity.

The excess steam is a
byproduct of the University’s steam
heating system, which is run by the
physical plant and heats campus
buildings. Although Bucknell has
used cogeneration since the early
1950’s, recent technological im-
provements in the process now al-
low the University to provide up to
25 percent of the campus’ electric-
ity needs.

This new cogeneration sys-
tem can also keep the campus self
sufficient during brief power out-
ages.

The process which creates
cogeneration starts when
Bucknell’s coal -fired boilers pro-
duce steam for heating and absorp-
tion air conditioning. The steam is
generated at 175 pounds per square
inch (psi) and must be reduced to
11 psi to be put to use. The excess
steam from this process is fed
through a turbine/generator unit to
produce electricity.

The two individuals most in-

ability would be moved to the indi-
vidual student, said Dadez.

Maguire said that he and a
group of fraternity presidents will
develop of viable mechanism for
implementing BYOB. According to
Maguire, he and Kristine Elliott 92,
president of Panhel, have already
developed a draft of the policy, with
the amount of beer allowed to be
consumed still to be resolved with
the administration. Under the
University’s current alcohol policy,
only one beer may be consumed ev-
ery hour, allowing a student four
beers fora registered party. Maguire
said, “We'd like it to be a six-pack
for a registered party.”

Students “will come in with X
beers, give them up to brothers, and
receive X tickets....{To redeem a
beer] you go to the 21 year old sec-
tion, they card you, and you ex-

volved with the project were Den-
nis Hawley, assistant director of the
physical plant, and Mike Noll, en-
ergy manager for Bucknell. Hawley
and Noll worked on the project de-
sign along with outside consulting
firms to create the system best fitted
to Bucknell’s needs.

Hawley graduated with a
bachelors degree in mechanical en-
gineering from Bucknell in 1972,
and later went on to receive his
masters degree. Mike Noll gradu-
ated with a bachelors degree from
the Williamson Free School of Me-
chanical Trades and also attended
the John Wannamaker School of
Artisans.

Although cogeneration in-
creases Bucknell’s output potential,
the University still must buy elec-
tricity from Pennsylvania Power
and Light (PP&L). This is because,
in regard to electrical power, “We
don’t have enough steam to supply
the campus,” according to Hawley.
However, he adds that “our effi-
ciency is greater than PP&L’s with
cogeneration because they lose
much of their output as steam.”

Bucknell’s ratio of energy out
per unit of coal burned is 2:3, while
PP&L’s ratio is closer to 1:3.

change a ticket for a beer,” Maguire
explained. He also noted that the
policy “is so cut and dried that it
limits flexibility.”

Maguire noted that this policy
will change the face of Bucknell’s
social life. “I can see the University
not liking it. The University has put
the social burden on the fraternities
which has set us up for criticism by
the faculty...but that is where the
University would like the social
burden to lie.”

Maguire predicted that
“people will drink downhill and
maybe consume more hard alcohol.
There will be greater pre-partying,
and it will definitely change the so-
cial atmosphere of the school.”

Although Maguire realized
that implementation will “take a
couple semesters at least, but we'd
like at least one trial weekend some-
where towards the end of the se-
mester.”

takes a stand on....We’ve already
crossed that bridge, it’s a question of
which things we are willing to do
this about.”

Clyde Peeling, local reptile
specialist and OUE task force coor-
dinator, said that he understands the
University’s decision, but that “I
wish they would [take a stand]. I
think a prestigious university would
carry a great deal of weight.”
Sackrey concurred, calling colleges
and universities “part of what cre-
ates moral leadership’ in
society....What would it say if
Bucknell took a stand? It would be
standing with its community. Unlike
Sojka, Peeling said “I think it would
have a greater impact” if the Uni-
versity took a stand,” and agreed
with Sackrey that “there are times
when it is important to take a posi-
tion.” However, Peeling was quick
to note that “President Sojka has
been very supportive in a lot of
ways. We really appreciate that.”

Both Sojka and Peeling did
agree that the community’s fight
against the incinerator is looking
more promising. Sojka said he was
“more hopeful...today than I was a
few months ago” that the project can
be blocked; he believes there was “‘a

small underestimation” by USPCI,
Inc. on the amount of opposition
their project would meet. Peeling
echoed those comments, saying, “I
think it’s going well. Just by the way
they [USPCI] react, I would say we
have them nervous.”

Peeling noted that company
officials have recently been ex-
tremely defensive at public meet-
ings, and that company officials
threatened a lawsuit after a USPCI
official attending a recent OUE
meeting was asked to leave and al-
legedly physically threatened.

Last October USPCI, a unit of
the Union Pacific Corporation, first
announced plans to construct a $100
million hazardous waste incinerator
on 700 acres in Gregg Township,
north of the village of Allenwood.
Since then, the story has gained na-
tional attention and OUE has gained
over 12,000 members in their efforts
to oppose the project, and over 50
organizations and individuals, in-
cluding most municipal govern-
ments and state and federal legisla-
tors, have publicly stated their op-
position to the process.

The permitting process which
USPCI must follow with the state
Department of Environmental Re-
sources is expected to take two
years.

more from ROTC than from any
other course I’ve taken in college.”
Stone agreed, adding that “by sev-
ering ties with ROTC, the University
will be limiting options to students.”

President Gary Sojka spoke
from the audience during Monday’s
session. Sojka stated that the De-
fense Department policy barring
homosexuals from the military
“seems to be a gratuitous and un-
necessary stance,” and that he is
working for change. According to
Sojka, if Bucknell remains associ-
ated with ROTC, the University will
be better able to pressure the mili-
tary for change.

Janice Butler, director of the
Women’s Resource Center, also
noted that the ROTC policy runs
counter to the University’s stated
policy against discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.

Butler said that students from
middle and working class families
“are economically pressured into
ROTC,” and that it is an unjust trade
to be pressured to sacrifice one’s life
for an education.

Mollie Janota ’91, represent-

ing the Umbrella Organization
agreed that there is a “fundamental
conflict” between the University’s
policy against discrimination and the
policy of not allowing homosexual
students to receive ROTC scholar-
ship funds or to enter the armed
forces with a commission upon
graduation.

While she indicated a personal
belief that Bucknell should disasso-
ciate itself with ROTC, the Umbrella
Organization does not advocate that
policy. Nevertheless, Janota ques-
tioned how long the University must
wait for the policy to change and as-
serted that ROTC has no place at
Bucknell. “If the organization was
discriminating against anyone else,
it wouldn’t be allowed on
campus,”’she said.

Brian Selmeski ’92, a ROTC
cadet attending Wednesday’s public
forum, commented that he was upset
“that there’s little attendance at these
meetings,” and that he was “dis-
couraged at the approach to recon-
cile the conflict,” saying that there is
some room to reach a compromise
and work for change within the
ROTC policy.

Women’s Resource Center launches
sexual assault awareness campaign

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

The Women’s Resource
Center and Psychological Service
in an attempt to infor m students
about sexual assault, has launched
a campus-wide awareness cam-
paign which will consist primarily
of mass mailings and posters. The
campaign began Tuesday when
students received informational
brochures about sexual assault,
especially as it relates to college
campuses.

The heightened campaign
against sexual assault is “not a
women’s issue. It’s a social issue
that men and women work to-
gether to solve,” said Janice But-
ler, director of the Women’s Re-
source Center. Butler and Arlyne
Hoyt, director of psychological
services, coordinated the project.

The campaign is in its first
week. Butler said the Women’s
Resource Center plans to follow
with a campus-wide poster cam-
paign. The purpose of posters, as
well as the mailings, is to increase
students’ awareness of sexual as-
sault.

The campaign will eventu-
ally lead to several discussions to
be sponsored by the Women’s Re-
source Center in April, Victims’
Rights Month.

In addition, the Women’s
Resource Center will provide peer
education programs for hall
groups, sororities, fraternities, and
student organizations.

Included in the packet of in-
formation mailed Tuesday, was a
letter explaining the need for such
acampaign and statistics about the
incidents of acquaintance rape.

A guide for Bucknell stu-
dents, part of the packet, provides
information about what to do in
the event of a sexual assault.
“Many young women don’t think
that it can happen and when it does
they don’t know what to do,” said
Butler, who began work on the
guide last year.

Students also received in-
formation on how to avoid sexual
assault, especially acquaintance
rape.

“T think that the mailing that
we just did will reach a lot of
people,” said Kristina Kelly ’93,a
student on the Women’s Resource
Advisory Board.

Kelly said she watched stu-
dents’ reactions as they found the

information packets in their mail-
boxes. “I didn’t see one woman
throw it [the information] out. I did
see a lot of men throw it out,” she
said. But even those who did not pay
attention to the information will hear
about it through “word of mouth”
Kelly said.

Prior to the start of this cam-
paign, the Women’s Resource Cen-
ter focused sporadically on the topic.
“We have done the programs; we
haven’t done it in such an organized
way,” said Butler.

“One of the things we’ re trying
to do is demonstrate that Bucknell is
committed to addressing this issue
seriously,” she added.

In the past, students received
information about sexual assault in-
directly, usually from pamphlets
mailed by the security office.

The Women’s Resource Cen-
ter will provide additional informa-
tion to groups requesting it. The
center also sponsors a program that
is mandatory for all freshman. The
program, “Metamorphosis,” focuses
primarily on date rape. “We do a
mandatory program for all first year
students because women who are
new to the college setting seem to be
the most vulnerable” to sexual as-
sault, Butler said.

Butler hopes that as a result of

the campaign, more organizations
will ask for help in sponsoring
small group presentations. She ex-
pects to reach 1000 students this
way. Kelly predicted that sororities
would be inclined to hold these
programs.

Concern over sexual assault
has received increasing recogni-
tion throughout the nation. Butler
says Bucknell’s program is de-
signed to help both men and
women avoid further incidents of
sexual assault. “Women can take
steps to reduce the risk try to avoid
sexual assault but it’s really only
men who can prevent it. They are
the ones who need to change their
behaviors,” she said.

According to Butler, many
incidents of sexual assault are re-
lated to alcohol. She did say,
however, that alcohol cannot be an
excuse for rape.

Kelly, too, related sexual as-
saults to alcohol. “Most campus
sexual assaults are fraternity-re-
lated and that is a fact taken from
the people I know, psychological
services, and the Women’s Re-
source Center,” she said. Kelly,
herself a member of a sorority, said
she would support a mandatory
awareness program for students in
fraternities and sororities.

Council and the Inter-fraternity

Council attended the Northeast
Panhellenic and Interfraternity
Council conferences, respectively,
where they won five awards between
them, including IFC president of the

year, which was won by Mike §

Dominguez 91.

Dominguez was voted presi-
dent of the year which “was pretty
incredible since there were over
1,000 students there from twelve
states,” said Denis Maguire ’93,
current IFC president. “Mike had to
deal with two very tough semesters.”

IFC also received awards for
academic excellence, best program-
ming, and the special achievement
award. Maguire explained the last
award was due to “the pressure and
controversy the Greek system has
gotten here, and how we pulled to-
gether.” Maguire noted that this was
another testament of Dominguez’s
leadership.

Panhel won the award for best
faculty relations programming this
year under the leadership of past
president Samantha Gladish ’91.

Kristine Elliott ’92, president
of Panhel, explained that in addition
to receiving the award, her board got
several “new ideas... on issues such
as hazing, sexism, faculty relations,
and philanthropy.”

Shailor appointed to new
vice presidency position

By Timothy W. Kirk

Following a major restructur-
ing of the administration, current
Special Assistant to the President
Barbara Shailor has accepted an ap-
pointment to the newly created posi-
tion of vice president for student
services.

Incorporating the duties of
special assistant to the president, as-
sociate vice president for student
life, and vice president for academic
services and planning, President
Gary Sojka has announced the es-
tablishment of the new office as a
major step in “providing for all of
our students a holistic education that
benefits from the significant interac-
tion of curricular, co-curricular, and
extracurricular opportunities.”

Emphasizing the effort of the
administration to “maximize the
benefits to all students of the pres-
ence of residential colleges and to
enhance the social, religious, ethnic,
and international diversity” on cam-
pus, Shailor sees the restructuring as
“an attempt to enhance all the good
things at Bucknell.” One of her main
tasks is a vigorous pursuit of faculty/
student interaction, specifically in a
co-curricular setting such as that of
the residential college.

The official responsibilities of
the office include: “Admissions;
Athletics, Career Development, Fi-
nancial Aid, Medical Services, the

Multiculture Center, Psychological
Services, R.O.T.C., the Registrar’s
Office, Residential Life, Student
Life, Student Activities and Orienta-
tion, the Weis Center and Cultural

Events, and the Women’s Resource
Center.” Though admittedly cover-
ing a wide spectrum of services, the
emphasis will be put on their effec-
tiveness to the student. “My own
feeling,” Shailor comments, “is that
student initiative is really important.
We in the administration can plan as
much as we want, but if that’s not
what students are interested in...then
it’s not going to work.” The admin-
istration seeks to integrate the entire
spectrum of services offered into

student life, and this office is a ma-
jor step in that direction.

Shailor, who first began work-
ing at Bucknell in 1975, is a profes-
sor of classics, specializing in Latin.
She took the position of Associate
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences in 1986, served as Associ-
ate Provost for a short time follow-
ing that, and is currently Special
Assistant to the President and Affir-
mative Action officer. Shailor will
begin her new duties July 1.

Students, staff, faculty form
SOS in support of troops

By Elizabeth Danneberg
Staff Writer

A recent addition to
Bucknell’s campus is an alternative
to STOP (Students and Teachers
Organized for Peace), a group
named, SOS, for “Support Our Sol-
diers”. The group’s intention is, just
as the name implies, to support the
troops, and also to help those in the
local area cope with the absence of
their loved ones serving in the
Middle East.

SOS, created by Christine
Degnon ’92 and Janelle Oltorik ’93,
composed of twelve members, lists
among its ranks, students, faculty,
and staff, half of which have rela-
tives and/or friends in the Persian
Gulf presently. According to Tom
Travis, professor of political science,
who was asked to advise SOS after
having given several talks on cam-
pus in support of the war, the group

has a three-fold purpose.
The first is to educate the

campus on reasons to support the
war. Second, SOS serves as an
educational alternative to STOP, a
group designed to protest the war.
And third, SOS intends to provide a
variety of activities to support the
troops abroad and their families and
friends at home.

One such activity is a number
of family support groups in the im-
mediate area, so that those left be-
hind can share their fears and anxi-
eties with each other.

As many students have seen
walking through the Langone Center
Mall, SOS has also initiated fund
raising drives. One, is the sale of
yellow ribbons this week, which in
the first two days alone raised $120.
Funds are fed through a local family
support group called Food Closet
and also through the Lewisburg Ar-
mory, and are allocated to families

in the local area who have been de-
nied an income because relatives
have been called to war. SOS has
also initiated a food drive for these
families who are in need.

The group’s founders were
were both motivated by the fact that
their brothers are now serving in
the Air Force in the Middle East.
Degnon mentioned that she and
Oltorik “felt it was important to do
something positive in support of
the troops. Whether the people
agree with our presence in the Gulf
or not our soldiers still need our

support at home.” Degnon also said
that she was “happy to do something
to help the community in addition to
Bucknell.”

Two other organizations are
also making an effort to assist SOS.
Campus Catholic Ministry has sold
ribbons in the LC this week, and
Alpha Phi Omega is participating in
the food drive, which will be held
early next week.

There will also be a support
assembly for soldiers on Saturday,
March 2 in front of the Lewisburg
post office.

sor to S.O.S. after having given several talks on campus in support of

Bush orders end
to ground war

President Bush ordered a
cease of all military maneuvers s
against Iraq’s battered army, declar-
ing Wednesday night that “Kuwait is
liberated” and that “Iraq’s army is
defeated.” The suspension began at
midnight Eastern time and will con-
tinue as long as Iraq agrees to not
launch missile attacks and attacks
against allied forces.

A permanent cease fire will
come only when Iraq agrees to
comply with all 12 United Nations
resolutions, frees all detained Ku-
wait citizens and prisoners of war,
and reveals to coalition forces the
exact location of all land and sea
mines Iraq laid in the area.

Bush appeared on national
television to announce the suspen-
sion of ground war. “Iraq’s army is
defeated. Our military objectives are
met. Kuwait is once more in the
hands of Kuwaitis in control of their
own destiny,” Bush told the nation.

Allies claim a decisive victory
over Saddam Hussein’s army.
General Schwarzkopf reported that
in the last two days of fighting, coa-
lition forces destroyed or captured
3,700 of the 4,230 tanks Iraq had at
the start of the war..He also said that
300,000 men, from 29 Iraqi divi-
sions, had been rendered incapable
of action and that at least 50,000 had
been taken as prisoners of war.
Schwarzkopf reported a high num-
ber of Iraqi deaths.

American casulaties for the
entire campaign totaled 79 dead, 213
wounded and 44 missing in action,
according to Schwarkopf.

Kuwait reports
atrocities

Reports that Iraq captured
40,000 Kuwaitis as they fled north
on Tuesday pale in comparison to
the atrocities citizens of Kuwait

faced in the months since the inva-
sion of their nation, according to
General Norman Schwarzkopf,
commander of the United States
coalition.

“They are not part of the same
human race, the people who did that,
as the rest of us are,” he said, in ref-
erence to the accounts of torture
Iraqis inflicted on Kuwaiti citizens.

Despite an attempt to restrict
the flow of news, which Defense
Secretary Cheney announced Satur-
day, reports of atrocities filtered
through army lines in the final days
of fighting. The reports revealed one
major weapon Iraq used against
Kuwait: torture. Tales of kidnap-
ping, pillaging and torture were
confirmed as allied forces entered
Kuwait early in the week.

One Kuwaiti army officer re-
ported that Iraq soldiers poured wa-
ter over prisoners and applied elec-
tric current when the captured per-
sons did not give the satisfactory an-
swers to questions.

Several rumors regarding tor-
ture in Kuwait could not be substan-
tiated. Hospital officials dispelled
rumors that Iraqis killed 300 chil-
dren and infants. Evidence indicates
that those Kuwaitis concidered op-
ponents of Iraqi occupation were
singled out for rough treatment.

USSR renews ties
with S. Africa

As apartheid collapses in
South Africa, the Soviet Union has
taken strides to renew diplomatic
ties severed 36 years ago. The two
nations have agreed to establish
“interest sections,” small working
sections set up within the existing
Austrian embassies, in each other’s
capitals.

A four day conference in
Vienna concluded Wednesday with
an agreement between Vladimir
Kazimirov, head of the Soviet For-
eign Ministry’s Africa section, and
Neil van Heerden, the director-gen-
eral of the South African Foreign

The decision came 36 years
after the Soviet Union severed ties
with South Africa because of its rac-
ist structure. But recent efforts by
President F.W. de Klerk of South
Africa to abolish the system of
apartheid rule have caused the Sovi-
ets to re-establish diplomatic rela-
tions.

The move to re-establish di-
plomacy between the two nations
also comes at a time when the Soviet
economy is Struggling.
“Gorbachev’s economic needs in
this case dovetail nicely with de
Klerk’s political changes,” one dip-
lomat said.

Centers to hold
finance seminar

Several small business devel-
opment centers, in affiliation with
the state organizations, will sponsor
a seminar on financial management
using the Lotus 1-2-3 computer pro-
gram and a personal computer on
March 26-28. The workshops, to be
held in the Dana Engineering Build-
ing from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., will be
limited to 16 participants and will
carry a charge of $50 per person.

Daniel Schleckser, full-time
business analyst for the Bucknell
Small Business Development Cen-
ter, will lead the seminar using a case
study approach, combining lectures
and hands-on training. The work-
shops will center on financial man-
agement and financial analysis.

Sponsors for the seminar are
the Bucknell Small Business Devel-
opment Center, the Association of
Small Business Development Cen-
ters, Lotus Development Corpora-
tion, the Pennsylvania Department
of Commerce and the Pennsylvania
Institute of Certified Public Ac-
countants.

Louisiana ties
pollution, taxes

In an unprecedented move to
discourage industrial pollution,
Louisiana has enacted a policy
which relates property tax exemp-
tions to a business’s environmental
record. The policy went into affect
in the December, after officials de-
termined that many of the same
companies which received large ex-
emptions of property tax were also
liable for thousands of dollars in
pollution fines.

According to new tax rules,

will feature a short slide show and
tours of the observatory. If the
weather is clear, visitors will be able
to view Venus, Mars and Jupiter
though the several telescopes.

Admission to the open house
is free. The observatory is located
south of the Christie Mathewson
stadium, on Stadium Road.

Travis speaks at
Susquehanna

Thomas Travis, professor of
political science at Bucknell Uni-
versity, traveled to Susquehanna
University Monday to deliver a lec-
ture entitled “The Wisdom of War in
the Persian Gulf.”

Travis, the author of articles
concerning conflicts in the Middle

Louisiana, the state with one of the
largest concentrations of chemical
contamination in the nation, will not
grant blanket tax exemptions to
companies. Instead, it will rate
companies based on records of past
environmental records. Companies
will receive exemptions depending
upon where they were placed on the
scale.

The new policy has been the
source of some debate. Industrial
groups say that the policy is too
harsh and fear that it will cause
businesses to leave the state. Envi-
ronmentalists, on the other hand, say
that Louisiana should strengthen the
policy, extracting even more money

CUNY toughens
standards

The trustees of the City Uni-
versity of New York (CUNY) voted
Monday in favor of a new college-
preparatory initiative, which would
create higher standards for admis-
sion to the university system. The
program would require incoming
freshmen to have completed a more
tigorous academic curriculum in
high school or to complete the extra
courses at CUNY to make up the
difference.

The plan should be phased in
over the next few years, beginning
in the fall of 1992. University offi-
cials claim that the higher admission
standards still will have no affect on
CUNY’s open admissions policy.

Three die in
Philadelphia fire

Three firefighters died Mon-
day in a fire that raged for over 18
hours in a Philadelphia office tower,
The fire caused devastating damage
on eight floors, and officials feared
that the top of the 38 story building
might collapse.

Investigations following the
fire revealed a total damage of $100
million. The estimated worth of the
building before the fire was $160
million.

According to fire officials, the
fire was worse than any other in the
last decade and could have been
controlled in an hour had a sprinkler
system been implemented on every
floor. Only after sprinklers on the
top ten floors began working did the
fire begin to subside.

Firefighters left the building
by 7:30 a.m. fearing a collapse of the
structure. The blaze was not extin-
guished until 3 p.m. The three who
were killed had signaled for help by
midnight, saying that their air tanks
were nearly empty. A rescue heli-
copter did not reach them in time.

Bush considers
bank reforms

The Bush Administration has,
in the past month, received numer-
ous proposals for bank reform, all of
which have called for increased de-
regulation in respect to commercial
banks. The reform would mean a
decrease in the federal government's
role in saving faltering banks
through deposit insurance.

Rather than focus on ways to
restore failing banks during the next
crisis, the proposals center instead
on preventing the government from

| having to shoulder the banks’ bur-

den in the next bank crisis.

The recent proposals focus
heavily on deregulation if the Con-
gress enacts a new banking law, it
too will place less emphasis on
government interaction. Presum-
ably, banks would be expected to
acknowledge more openly that they
are operation, in part, with uninsured
deposits.

Two levels of banking would
be the likely outcome of such a bill.
On one level, customers could have
deposits federally insure. At the
other, customers would receive high
interest rates on uninsured deposits.

Bathrooms: Ace reporter evaluates
the best and the worst on campus

By David Soll
Staff Writer

The beauty of Bucknell’s
campus is certainly one of the
university’s greatest strengths. But,
some people complain that the end-
less stream of red brick and white
trim become a bit monotonous after
a while. There is some diversity to
be found though, of all places, in the
bathrooms. A_ stroll through
Bucknell’s restrooms reveals the
passage of time and the correspond-
ing changes in bathroom decor.

A Classic

The best place to start is with
the men’s restroom in Vaughan Lit-
erature. Among the oldest restrooms
on campus, it has a great deal of
character. The door is made of a
deep brown wood with “men”
painted on the door itself and on the

Remember “GOING” with
people in junior high school? It
was easy. A guy would purpose-
fully stride over to the appropri-
ate girl, place his hands deep in-
side the pockets of his parachute
pants, look up into her eyes and
bravely squeak, “Will you ask
your friend Norma if she likes
me... only don’t tell her I asked
you to ask her...unless she says
she DOES like me...then ask her
if shell ‘GO’ with me.”

Of course, no one actually
resolved where exactly you were
supposed to “GO.” The more se-
rious couples did eat lunch at the

more exciting than seeing a
couple casually stroll by HOLD-
ING HANDS! The big scandal
in 7th grade Outdoor Education
was when Andrew and Sarah
(who had been “GOING” for a
few weeks and were pretty seri-
ous) made out “for like two min-
utes” in a bush after a romantic
evening of promenades and
allemand lefts at the late night
square dance. Then, Sarah got
mad when Andrew accidently
cut the inside of her lip with his
braces and, after an intense con-
sultation with all the females in
Mr. Evan’s class, decided that
she and Andrew would “just be
friends.”

Well, the junior high
school days are over. We re-
ceived our driver’s licences, got
our braces off, and most of us no
longer sport parachute leg-wear.
As far as the dating game is
concerned, we’ve abandoned our
romantic Dos-i-dos in favor of a
more chaotic slam-dance. . . that
still doesn’t “GO” anywhere.

I think a major catas-
trophe in our romantic evolution
was the elimination of the middle
man. It is no longer socially ac-
ceptable to hide bashfully in your
room while your best friend
makes the love connection.
Now, we have to rely entirely on
vibes that a potential love-inter-
est gives off. My personal prob-

interpret them leads to over-

A Travesty

The most obvious contrast to
the Vaughan Literature bathrooms
are the pathetically stark Chemistry
restrooms. Any restroom in which
one has to make two right tums to
get to the urinals is extremely sus-
pect. The door has an annoying
handle to match the rest of the an-
noying handles in the Chemistry
building. The restroom’s most mys-
tifying aspect is its abundance of
space which serves absolutely no
function. The irony of this struck
me; it is the efficient Chemistry
building after all. The granite is piti-
fully fake and the tiles resemble hues

The Dating Game...Lame!

Hmmmmm, when I made
that joke about the parrot with
the bladder control problem she
waited before she laughed. Why
did she do that? Does that mean
she was only laughing to make

I'ma dork? Or maybe she didn't
think it was funny but she
laughed because she really
DOES LIKE me?!? Or maybe
She really DID think it was funny,
but still doesn't like me. But then
again, if she DID like the joke,
maybe she changed her mind,

A Smooth Transition

The library restrooms occupy
the middle ground between the old
and new, between modern and ro-
botic. It does have some faults,
namely that the paper towel rack is
separated from the sink area by an
unnecessary wall. This is bewilder-
ing, and results in many wet T-shirts.

The restroom’s better features in-
clude two-tone signs at the door and
full-length mirrors, which are essen-
tial on Upper Level 2 where more
socializing than studying takes
place. Like the Vaughan restrooms,
one can hear the churning of the
pipes in the other restrooms in the
library, lending a human feel to the
otherwise thoroughly modern
restroom. Whichever restroom in the
library one prefers, one is assured of
a positive experience.

Former diplomat teaches at Bucknell

Foriegn Service career lends experience to classroom

By Lisa Lipari
Staff Writer

Before coming to Bucknell
last fall, International Relations Pro-
fessor Basil Ince had a career in the
Foreign Service as well as in ama-
teur athletics.

Born in Trinidad, a small
country off the coast of Venezuela,
Ince came to the United States to
study at Tufts University in Boston.
After receiving his graduate degree
in International Relations from New
York University, Ince became the
United Nations delegate to Trinidad
in 1962.

Following his two-year term at
the UN, Ince then taught in the States
at various universities, including
State University of New York at
Binghamton and the University of
Puerto Rico. He returned to Trinidad
to teach at the University of West
Indies, and later became the Director
of the Institute of International Rela-
tions there.

After 17 years in the teaching
profession, Ince was elected Foreign
Minister of Trinidad and Tobago in

1981. The selection committee “‘ap-
parently felt that I must know some-
thing about the subject,” Ince said
modestly about his qualifications for
the position. More accurately, his

the nation’s economic and trade-re-
lated issues. Since Trinidad was a
British colony until 1962 and is to-
day a state within the British Com-
monwealth, Trinidad has historically

“As a professor, you always
have plans for what you
will do that day.
As a foreign minister, you wake up
not knowing what the
next crisis will be...”

published articles on international
relations in the Caribbean attracted
world-wide attention to his expertise
in the politics of that area.

As foreign minister, Ince’s
primary responsibility was the
analysis of reports from Trinidadian
diplomats. Ince then determined
policy for the state of Trinidad, at-
tempting to “present Trinidad to the
world” in the best manner possible
and to “serve its own people.”

Ince most frequently handled

enjoyed preferential trade relations
with the United Kingdom. When the
United Kingdom joined the Commo
Market, Ince worked to assure that
the beneficial trade arrangements
would continue.

Ince was also involved in the
negotiations over a maritime bound-
ary between Venezuela and
Trinidad. His committee sought a
peaceful settlement of the dispute
over where to demarcate (meaning
“to physically designate”) the terri-

torial lines in the sea.

In addition to his success in
the political world, Ince was also
outstanding in athletics. A member
of the Tufts University track team,
he set a university record in the 400
meter. He later ran for Trinidad in
the 1959 Pan-American games and
won a gold medal for the 1600 meter
relay and a silver medal for the 400
meter.

Ince was selected for the
Olympics in 1960, but was unable to
compete because he became ill.
Commented Ince, “If there were any
disappointments in my life, that was
one of them.” He still likes to jog and
lift weights and is a music and the-
ater enthusiast.

As “the new kid on the block”
at Bucknell, Ince is teaching a new
course both this semester and next
semester on International Relations
in the Caribbean. Having traveled all
over the world, he finds Lewisburg
to be “‘an environment that fits nicely
with my quiet lifestyle.” Yet, he does.
acknowledge that Bucknell is indeed
“three hours from everywhere.”

Reflecting on his varied ca-

What happens when globe-trotting
Bucknellians return to Lewisburg?

Or, who are these people and what am! doing here?

By Jen Marshall
Staff Writer

“Great! I’m prepared for any-
thing now!” I thought as I zipped
the bulging bag that I was taking
with me to Italy on my study abroad
program. I had packed pictures of
my family, house, and dog, many is-
sues of Cosmopolitan, a dictionary
of Italian slang, my favorite pillow-
case, and a handy travel map of Italy.
Sure that I had packed every possible
cure for homesickness and culture—
shock, I set off for my Italian adven-
ture. My preventative measures
against homesickness and culture—
shock were effective, and I had a
wonderful time in Milan. I con-
gratulated myself on being so smart
and avoiding that silly homesickness
trap. Unfortunately, there was a
whole other side to the problem that
I had not foreseen...

What happens when an ex-
change student returns home to the
United States after an extended stay
abroad? Can’t he or she feel a sort
of shock and estrangement towards
American society, much like the
shock felt when first arriving in a
foreign country? In the excitement
of preparing for a stay abroad, these
considerations are often neglected.
Yet, sometimes the return home can
be as traumatic and unsettling as the
first few days abroad. These con-
cems are of special importance to
Bucknellians, as 143 students were
abroad last fall, and 99 are abroad
this semester. You or a friend of
yours could be experiencing these
same re-entry problems right this
very second.

Not everyone has difficulty
with returning to America, in fact
some just plop back in front of the
TV with L.A. Law like they had
never left. For others, the transition
isn’t so easy. According to Arlyne

Hoyt, director of Psychological
Services, students may feel es-
tranged from friends because so
much has happened since they left
and they think that it will be impos-

sible to “catch up”. Others feel they
have matured in ways that their
friends haven’t, and therefore they
can’t relate.

Also, Hoyt said, America
doesn’t always look like the golden
land anymore, and ethnocentric illu-
sions are shattered. Bucknell sud-
denly isn’t the glorious center of the
world anymore, it has lost a bit of
luster. With all of these thoughts
and emotions running through one’s
brain, no wonder re—adjusting can be
difficult.

Elizabeth Kormeier ’91, spent
two semesters in France and said that

OUTS? ure
We pew ee pesenu®
Ext

os Me™""'59 3.7999

her first month back in the United
States was hard. “You change,
friends change, you aren’t in the
same cliques anymore. Sometimes
it was hard to relate because I was

wrapped up in my abroad experience
and they were wrapped up in what-
ever they had been doing here.”
Elizabeth also missed the in-
dependence and mobility that she
had while abroad. (For those of you
who don’t know, Europe is equipped
with a wonderful, cheap, train sys-
tem that can take you anywhere.
And best of all, there are no parents
or other such annoying authority
figures to squash your travels.)
Another Bucknellian who ex-
perienced a sort of culture shock
upon returning to Bucknell was
Dominic Madigan ’91. Dominic

spent four months in Kenya last se-
mester and when he returned to
America he was shocked at the ex-
tent of our materialism. Living a
simple life in Kenya made him sen-
sitive to our Ways of excess, he said.
He also felt estranged from his peers
for a time, because it was difficult to
relate fully the extent of his experi-
ences in Africa. Dominic felt that he
had grown in ways that he couldn’t
expect his peers to understand be-
cause they had not been to Kenya.

Happily, life did get better for
these Bucknellians. Readjustment
can take anywhere from a few days
to a few months, but it will eventu-
ally happen. How can you make
your transition easier?

Hoyt suggests allowing your-
self to feel these strange emotions of
alienation and share them. Talking
to others that have been through cul-
tural readjustment can help, too, she
said.

Madigan also advocates find-
ing and talking to people who have
had similar experiences—whether
they have visited the same country
as you or they are just feeling “out of
it.”

If you know someone who has
just returned from a study abroad,
there are things you can do to help
them readjust to Bucknell life, ac-
cording to Hoyt. Let them know
that you are glad they’re back and
that you missed them. Take the time
to fill them in on what happened
when they were away; be as willing
to listen to their stories about the trip.
If you think your friend is acting re-
ally strange, don’t be afraid to say
something or even suggest that they
visit a counselor. Friends can go a
long way in helping a person to re—
acclimate themselves to Bucknell, or
any other foreign place.

BYOB: “Isn't there a better way?”

A new alcohol policy which promises to once again change the character of Bucknell’s social life will soon

go into effect. The dreaded “BYOB” or “bring your own beer” policy, which is already plaguing the University

of Pennsylvania, Penn State, and the University of Maryland, will soon infect Bucknell.

The policy is an underhanded attempt on behalf of fraternity nationals and insurance companies to shift

liability to individual fraternity members. Unlike previous efforts to shift to a BYOB policy, the University is not

spearheading this attempt.

The action is not without reason. Fraternities have borne the brunt of a number of lawsuits, and there have

even been recent examples at Bucknell. Just last December, Tau Kappa Epsilon was fined $1300 in connection

with underage drinking charges filed by Lewisburg Police.

If fraternities continue to purchase common sources of alcohol and are caught, they will face disciplinary

action from their nationals; this action might be as severe as chapter derecognition. If, on the other hand, indi-

vidual fraternity members purchase the common sources of alcohol, they alone will bear the liability. No longer

will fraternity brothers be insulated from liability by their national’s insurance policies.

Ironically, some fraternity brothers have expressed their support for BYOB, arguing that the policy will

relieve fraternities of the financial burdens associated with supplying thirsty patrons. Perhaps. But the fact re-

mains that the nationals have tumed their backs on brothers who might violate the new policy; in such a case the

fraternity’s insurance policy will do nothing to protect those brothers.

BYOB, if enforced, will stifle fraternity parties and create problems both on- and off-campus. It will force

parties into town where BYOB restrictions aren’t in effect, and the resulting parties are sure to worsen town-

gown relations. Students driving to and from in-town parties will create yet another hazard.

Worse still, the increasing difficulty of obtaining beer will push students toward hard alcohol consumption

and drug use—a dangerous attempt at a more powerful buzz.

Finally, the number and magnitude of dorm parties will increase, placing more burdens upon already dis-

gruntled Resident Assistants.

In any case, it is questionable how much effect the policy will have. The possibilities for evasion are nu-

merous. Will security monitors be able to effectively tag and distribute beer for a large number of students? What

is to prevent students from placing 4 (or 6) beers on reserve at a number of different fraternities and simply riding

the circuit?

A new BYOB policy holds no benefits for Bucknell; it is lite more than another misguided attempt to

control the uncontrollable—underage and irresponsible drinking. It is even doubtful that any Bucknell chapters

will reap the benefits of lower insurance policy rates. Isn’t there a better way?

Former professor of

military science argues

for ROTC’s retention

To the Editor:

As a former Professor of
Military Science at Bucknell, I
see three fundamental flaws in
the rationale presented for ban-
ning ROTC. First, a soldier is
neither immoral nor corrupt.
Citizen-soldiers founded this
country and remain important
members of our community
today.

ROTC remains the em-
bodiment of the citizen-soldier
concept. Through its presence
on over 400 colleges and univer-
sities across the country, ROTC
creates an officer corps that truly
represents the diversity that is
America. More importantly, it
reaffirms our commitment to
civilian control over the military
by giving the university a role in
the selection of military officers.
Only those meeting the school’s
degree requirements receive
commissions.

To say that the training
and selection of the military
leaders of our Armed Forces is
beneath Bucknell ignores the
significance of these tasks. To
scom and ostracize the young
men and women choosing to
devote a portion of their lives to
defending the nation that gave
them so much ignores their
courage and patriotism. To con-
tinually ban groups with differ-

ing views or beliefs is inconsis-
tent with the University’s con-
cept of academic freedom.

A wise Englishman once
said, “‘A country that draws a

sharp line of demarcation be-
tween its thinking men and its
fighting men will find its fight-
ing done by fools and its think-
ing done by cowards.” Secretary
Cheney does not strike me as a
coward; General Powell does not
strike me as a fool. We should
all be grateful that our system to
select our military leaders works.
It underscores the importance of
continuing to draw officers from
Bucknell and schools of its cali-
ber.

Secondly, strong and ready
Armed Forces are not a result of
the denunciation of those who
join; strength comes from en-
couraging the very best to join.
There is no shame in the high
percentage of minorities in mili-
tary leadership roles, only pride.
It indicates that the Armed
Forces offer more opportunities,
based on ability, than do other
careers. The Armed Forces
should be congratulated, not
condemned, for offering scholar-
ships to students with outstand-
ing academic and leadership
abilities. Our nation’s future
depends on well educated young
men and women.

Finally, an even bigger
flaw in the argument is the per-
ception that any organization
with differing concepts, beliefs,
or precepts can be done away
with. I’m sorry, I don’t agree.
America doesn’t work that way.

To the Editor:

I would like to address Diane
Oltorik’s letter, published in The
Bucknellian of February 15.

Mrs. Oltorik, I would
respectfully suggest that what
you would have President
Sojka do about S.T.O.P. would
undermine just those American
values that you so fervently
affirm. What could our freedom
of speech possibly mean if it
did not protect the rights of
those with unpopular views to
put forth those views, not only in
words, but in acts and symbols?
What is at stake here is not destruc-
tion or defacement of university

Student criticizes peers for

To the Editor:

In light of the Bucknellian’ s
student survey of last week [Febru-
ary 15, 1991], I would like to ask
those same 79 students, “Do you
really care or try hard enough to
find out what is happening in the
Persian Gulf?” President Sojka
(finally) put together a teach-in last
Sunday [February 17, 1991] in
Vaughan Literature Auditorium at
which there were an embarrassing
30 or so students in attendance.
Were you too busy, too hung over,
Or just too apathetic to attend? With
a war raging in the Middle East
possibly killing hundreds of thou-
sands of human beings—soldiers
and civilians, allies and Iraqis—
can’t you take a few hours to actu-
ally find out what’s going on? This
was a prime opportunity in educa-
tion and I applaud President Sojka

No. I don’t think they should
sever the ties. The program
provides a service to students,
enabling them to go to college.
After all, it’s voluntary and is not
forced on anyone. In the future
these people may be in positions
of military power and it’s nice to
know they have a well-rounded
education behind them.

Skena’s
Prescription

By David Skena

A prescription is, according to
Webster, a written direction for a
therapeutic or corrective agent. The
goal of this column is not simply to
cite problems but also to offer pos-
sible solutions to them, the intent is
to be constructive, not accusatory.

Although Bucknell is a
healthy institution, one can always
improve it and make it stronger than
it ever was before. Faculty/ Student
relations are my current concern.
Larry Shinn once explained, and I
agree with him, that it seems as
though the faculty members have
general complaints about the stu-
dents but when asked if they have

Gene Chenoweth

Ours is a fundamentally and pro-
foundly violent culture. Higher
education’s contribution to that
consists of more than its affiliations
to the ROTC program. I doubt that
severing ties with ROTC will get to
the heart of the matter as the uni-
versity should endeavor to do. We
should insist that ROTC cease to
discriminate on the basis of gender
and sexual preference.

any good students they are able to
sound off at least a half dozen with-
out hesitation. The opposite is also
true; we, as students, complain about
the actions of the faculty as a whole
but are able to name several profes-
sors that we enjoy and respect.

What I think is missing is the
out-of-the-classroom interaction that
many students anticipated would
occur at a small liberal arts college.
The response to this complaint by
many faculty is that they are under
so much pressure to do so many
things that informal interaction with
students simply falls to the bottom
of the priority list and is rarely ac-
complished. So how can this lack of
informal communication be ad-
dressed? Well, the responsibilities
of the professors are not likely to di-
minish and the work load of students
is also cumbersome. I recommend
that the time and the place for this
kind of interaction is lunchtime in
the Langone Center.

Why? The Langone Center is
convenient for everyone, our brand

Should Bucknell sever university ties

with ROTC?

Greg May ’92

There are ROTC students who are
making positive contributions to
this University; one they could not
have attended without ROTC
money. If Bucknell decides that it
wants to continue training officers,
fine. The military, although often
misused, serves a necessary func-
tion in this world: defense. If BU
decides to sever ties, it must find
the scholarship money elsewhere.

to be and students with meal plans
can treat their professor to a free
meal at the caf., the Terrace Room or
a Buttery via the OSA’s Meal Con-
nection program. We all have to eat
so why not use the time to get to
know each other better as individu-
als. Professors, tell your students
that they are welcome to join you for
lunch. Students, make the effort to
be there and try using ‘The Meal
Connection.’ Animosity between
students and faculty is a problem that
must be worked on individually and
collectively. I have presented a few
steps all of us can take individually
but I can’t force any of my medicine
down your throat. Do what is com-
fortable, but do something. My next
article will concern how this problem
can be addressed collectively

While I don’t agree with the Fed-

with Jenk’s proposal that ROTC
only teaches people to kill, I be-
lieve the ROTC program adds
diversity which every liberal arts
college should have.

I think it's right that Jenks opposes
the discrimination against gays and
lesbians. All people should be
allowed to be in ROTC. I think
ROTC is a good program for
people who genuinely want to do it.
We are lacking scholarship pro-
grams here at Bucknell, so if
people without the money want to
get a Bucknell education, they must
sell their lives away to the Army.

No, because | feel that you can-
not simply look at an issue from
an ideal point of view. I'm not in
favor of war and killing but I
think that this is not all that
ROTC does. Furthermore, lots of
people depend on ROTC to at-
tend Bucknell.

Student addresses parking
problems on campus

To the Editor:

I would like to address
the parking problem. My car is
registered; so far I’ve received
three tickets and we’re only
three weeks into the semester.

I know I am not
alone in this problem
as I’m sure the De-
partment of Security
and Safety is well
aware due to the
number of tickets they
issue. I can under-
stand giving tickets to
cars that are blatantly
parked illegally for the sake of
being closer to the dorm build-
ings, but that is not the issue
here. So many times I have
searched the lot behind
Lambda Chi only to find there
are absolutely no student park-
ing spots available.

Where should one go
when this happens? I am sorry,
but I do believe that the De-
partment of Security and

Safety has made a classical error in
allowing more people to register
their cars than there are parking
spots available. Something must be
done about this.

The reason | paid a registra-
tion fee is to be able to park on

It is simply not fair to the law-
abiding students who are reg-
istered to have no other op-
tion, but to park illegally

campus and the Department of
Security and Safety is simply not
fulfilling its end of the bargain,
since there are not enough parking
spots. It is simply not fair to the
law-abiding students who are regis-
tered to have no other option, but to
park illegally.

Also, I find it ironic to think
that when there are no spots avail-
able one is still expected to some-
how miraculously locate a legal

spot, probably quite a distance
away, which could be rather
unsafe late at night.

Also, why is Bucknell
allowed to charge $10 per ticket
while the city of Lewisburg only
charges $3?

I think that one
solution would be to limit
the number of students
allowed to register their
vehicles. This could be
done on a first come, first
served basis and when the
number of cars registered
is equivalent to the num-
ber of spaces, registration
should be closed.

Another alternative would
be to increase the number of
student parking spots. I sincerely
hope that the Department of
Security and Safety takes some
initiative to try to solve this
problem because it is very frus-
trating for the driving population
of Bucknell.

Sojka expresses concern
about sexual assault issue

To the Campus Community:

These days we all have a lot
on our minds. Each of us can be
preoccupied with the Gulf War, the
ROTC issue, budget crunches,
pledge activities, course work, and
the list goes on. At this time, how-
ever, I’d like to ask that we take
time out to consider another impor-
tant concern facing universities
today—the problem of sexual as-
sault on campus.

This phenomenon appears to
be widespread, affecting one in six
college women and one in twelve
college men, according to a na-
tional survey of over 6,000 stu-
dents conducted by psychologist
Dr. Mary Koss, the National Insti-
tute for Mental Health, and Ms.
magazine.

Earlier this week, there was a
campus-wide mailing to alert stu-
dents and staff to the problems
associated with sexual assault. This.
mailing is part of a Sexual Assault
Awareness Campaign being con-
ducted at Bucknell. Our aim is to

educate the community and, hope-
fully, prevent sexual abuses from
occurring here. The University is
committed to addressing this issue
in a responsible way that will en-
able students to reduce their risks
and assist them in the unfortunate
event that they are victimized.
As President, I am concerned

| want to send the
message that
sexual assault will
not be tolerated at
Bucknell.

with the welfare of all students and
employees and am supporting this
Awareness Campaign to hopefully
spare some individuals the pain and
trauma of becoming involved in
such incidents. Perhaps most im-
portantly, I want to send the mes-

sage that sexual assault will not be
tolerated at Bucknell. It is a clear
violation of the University’s Code
of Conduct and those who behave
in a sexually abusive manner can
face severe sanctions.

I encourage all individuals to
become familiar with the literature
and educational resources Bucknell
offers. Self-defense workshops,
prevention programs for men as
well as women, educational videos,
counseling, and medical services
are all available. For more details
about these resources, contact the
Women’s Resource Center or Psy-
chological Services.

We can learn from the infor-
mation currently being dissemi-
nated and I hope that you will join
me in the campaign to make
Bucknell a safe living and learning
environment for all.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Readers reply to professor’s letter regarding S.T.O.P.

Professor understands McGuire’s argument

To the Editor:

1 am writing in answer to Professor
McGuire’s letter objecting to the memo I
drafted that was sent to the faculty by
S.T.O.P., under several member’s names,
including Professor Keen’s. Having ini-
tially shared Paul McGuire’s concerns, I
think I understand them. I was persuaded,
though, that it was reasonable to suggest
that the faculty bring up the war in the first
class meeting of the year.

One argument I found persuasive
was that students and other members of the
university community were being affected
by the war. Indeed, when I brought up the
topic in my largest class, students who had
relatives at the front felt freed to talk about
their fears.

There were two reasons I still hesi-
tated to allow this discussion to take place.
First, I was wary of a class discussion that

might entail presenting my view of the war.

As it turned out, the students carried the

discussion. Many of them clearly needed
and wanted a chance to voice their opin-
ions, strong feelings, and beliefs.

Was it polarizing, as Prof. McGuire
suggests? Perhaps. I suspect there were
some students who kept their views to
themselves and resented other students’
impassioned statements. I don’t think
controversy is out of place in a college
classroom, however. As an educator, I
think it is important for college students to
learn to articulate their ideas and values,
and to argue effectively. I sense that Buck-
nell students are often reluctant to confront
real difference of opinion. I believe that
hesitation to engage in argumentation,
because it is seen as rude, can hinder intel-
lectual development.

To return to my first concern, I make
an effort (not always successful) to keep
my political views out of the classroom. I
am sure there are a few students in my
classes who inferred from my attempted
neutrality that I supported the way Presi-

dent Bush conducted this war. I intention-
ally revealed my position only to selected
students with whom I was having less
public discussion, and then only for par-
ticular reasons and when I believed it was
not threatening to them. Consequently, I
regret that Professor McGuire revealed my
position in his letter to the student newspa-
per and has made it an issue in my peda-
gogy. I wish he had taken another route to
express his apprehensions and to ascertain
exactly what we were proposing.

Another reservation I had was that,
like Professor McGuire, I thought the dis-
cussion should be justified by relating it to
the course material. Professor Keen, al-
though he didn’t share that concern,
helped me identify ways that my discipline
can be used to clarify issues related to the
war (admittedly an easier task in social
psychology than math). The reason we
suggested that interested faculty contact
Emice is that, as an experienced teacher,
clinical psychologist, and practicing thera-

pist, he is skilled at broaching touchy top-
ics in ways that promote sensitivity to
various points of view and individual vul-
nerabilities.

As for the material we offered to
send—yes, they were selected articles.
Initially deplorably ignorant, I learned
much about the Persian Gulf region from
my colleagues (not all of them anti-war, by
the way) in political science, religion, inter-
national relations, and economics at the
first teach-in. I continued to read about it
during January. If the the articles I selected
(from such sources as The Village Voice
and Journal of the American Medical Asso-
ciation) support an antiwar perspective, I
assume faculty are intelligent and sophisti-
cated enough to consider the source, judge
the quality of the arguments, and extract
the information they consider useful.

There were several unwarranted
assumptions in Professor McGuire’s letter:
First, that we were suggesting that profes-
sors expound a position on the war rather
than that they facilitate a discussion; sec-
ond, that open discussion produces polar-
ization rather than understanding and rap-
prochement; and third, that our country’s

Professor refutes
letter’s concerns

To the Editor:

Having just read Professor
McGuire’s statements of outrage over a
letter sent to faculty members by Students
and Teachers Organized for Peace
(S.T.O.P.), I felt it necessary to reply as
one of the S.T.O.P. members who con-
curred in the decision to send the letter.

As Professor McGuire indicated, the
letter encouraged faculty members to take
their first class session of the semester to
discuss the Persian Gulf war with their
students. The letter also indicated the avail-
ability of a series of articles that $.T.O.P.
had collected which could be of use to
faculty members discussing particular
aspects of the Gulf war. It also called atten-
tion to the fact that several $.T.O.P. mem-
bers had expertise in various aspects of the
crisis, and that this expertise may be help-
ful in planning a class discussion.

Our decision to ask faculty to take
this time to discuss the war was based on
many years of experience as students and
teachers in which we found that the first
day of class was often devoted to lengthy
and largely pointless discussion of the
mechanics of a course, or involved a short-
ened session in which syllabi were passed
out, attendance was called, and students
were dismissed. In the period between
semesters our government has initiated a
war which had already cost tens of thou-
sands of lives. As a result of this fact, we
thought the actions of our government
might have been more worthy of discussion
than the usual first day fare. Of course, I
have to admit that we made this judgment
in total ignorance of the contents of Profes-
sor McGuire’s course plan for the first day
of class.

Apart from the question of the ethics
of disrupting the opening day trivialities to
talk about a war, there is a more general
question about the ethics of using the class-
room to discuss material other than that
indicated by the course catalogue. Here
also I have to confess to having somewhat
different ethical standard that Professor
McGuire. When I was growing up, I
learned about how the Nazis had gassed six
million Jews while the German people
complacently went about their business. I
always found it mindboggling that suppos-
edly civilized people could conduct them-
selves in this manner. I hope that if I was
ever in similar circumstances I would use
whatever forum I might have to oppose
such genocide until I was fired or arrested.

There is one final point I’d like to
make. Professor McGuire indicated some
concern about political considerations
entering the review process for retention
and promotion of faculty as a result of the

fact that one of the signers of the letter
currently chairs the University Review
Committee (URC). There are three mem-
bers of the administration that also sit on
this committee. I think we can all have
absolute confidence that these three admin-
istrators will act to ensure that the URC
will never decide against retention or pro-
motion of a faculty member because he or
she has not cooperated with a political
organization working to oppose U.S. for-
eign policy.

Dance & music tomorrow at Weis

By Laura Grisin
Staff Writer

Regarded as one of the most
distinctive and influential forces in
contemporary dance, Laura Dean
will bring her company, Laura Dean
Dancers and Musicians, to the Weis
Center tomorrow night at 8 p.m.

“Laura Dean is, I think, unique
as a choreographer who is also a
skilled composer and therefore
writes the music and choreographs
the dance in tandem,” said William
Boswell, director of cultural events.
“Her works are distinctive, using a
bold, personal style of evolved pat-
terns of movement and music. The
dancers are meticulously disciplined
and the overall effect of this concert
should be incredibly powerful and
enthralling.”

Dean formed the Laura Dean
Dance and Music Foundation in
1975, creating a company dedicated
to live performance of both music
and dance. The ensemble of 11
dancers and four musicians, who
“take over the stage like a small,
self-contained tornado,” according
to The Minneapolis Star and Tri-
bune, has performed and taught in
hundreds of cities across the United
States and on four continents. In ad-
dition, Dean’s work has been com-
missioned by the Joffrey Ballet, the
New York City Ballet and the Royal
Danish Ballet.

Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians will perform three pieces, including “Magnetic” (shown above), to-
morrow at the Weis Center. Dean is unique in that she composes her own music for her choreography.

Tomorrow night’s program
will include three pieces: “Mag-
netic,” “Inner Circle,” and “Infin-
ity.” The third, which premiered last
July at the American Dance Festival,
was described by The New York

Times as “a superb example of how
rich her choreography can be.”
While on campus today, com-
pany member Anne Wennerstrand
offered a modern dance class for
students, faculty and residents of

Lewisburg. This class is one in a se-
ries taught by Weis Center perform-
ers to the Bucknell community.
Tickets, $5 with a Bucknell
I.D., are still available at the Weis
Center Box Office and at the door.

Bob Dylan rocked Capitol Theatre “Like A Rolling Stone”

By Brian Tosh and
Jon Elliot
Staff Writer

It has been said that the heart-
beat of the 1960’s, Bob Dylan, has
in recent years slowed down to a
near flat line. From his stadium tour
with the Grateful Dead in the sum-
mer of 1987 to his recent album re-
leases, Down In The Grove, Oh
Mercy and this winter’s Under aRed
Sky, critics and fans alike were be-
ginning to believe that the spark in
Dylan which composed such 60’s
anthems as “Like a Rolling Stone”
and “All Along the Watchtower”
had died. But those who traveled to
Williamsport’s Capitol Theater last
Thursday night were treated to a re-
birth of the music which exemplified
the spirit of the Vietnam generation.

Bob Dylan, along with John
Lennon, was honored the previous
night in New York City at the annual
Grammy Awards, with a coveted
lifetime achievement award. View-
ers, even Dylan dichards, were a bit
confused as to what it was that Dylan
muttered as he performed that night,
so ticket holders for Thursday night

were a bit apprehensive about what
to expect.

As show time approached, the
lines outside diminished. Inside,
Penn State local J. R. Mangan and
his acoustic guitar entertained the
growing crowd. But soon enough,
the stage was set for what was to be
a most memorable night.

Dylan took the stage’ at 8:30,
and for the next two hours
Williamsport relived a piece of the
60’s with a 90’s taste. Dressed in a
dark checkered jacket, white hat, and
now trademark unkept beard, Dylan
thrilled the crowd with what can
only be described as one of the best
concerts this area has been treated to
in a long time. Backed by a four
piece electrical band, he pulled out
classic tunes such as “Lay Lady
Lay” and “All Along the Watch-
tower,” as well as new hits like
“Wiggle, Wiggle.” Dylan played
every song with what seemed to be
an entirely different rhythmic
melody, singing throughout the en-
tire night with his trademark
mumble, as fans both old and new
followed along with his every word.

After about half a dozen

songs, Dylan turned off all the amps
and began an anxiously awaited
acoustic set. The crowd sat breath-
lessly as they were treated to such
classics as “Don’t Think Twice, Ma”
and “Mr. Tambourine Man.” For the
rest of the night, the band switched
back and forth from electric to
acoustic equipment, thrilling the
fans*with such memorable gems as
“Like a Rolling Stone” and “Blowin’
in the Wind.” Dylan wound up the
show and brought down the house
with a smoking rendition of
“Maggie’s Farm.” Surprisingly, it
was some of his newer tunes, such
as “God Knows” and “The Man In
the Long Black Coat,” which re-
ceived most of the applause.

The energy and emotion felt
that night in Williamsport left the
crowd with an uncanny memory of
the 1960’s and Vietnam. Although
Dylan has never been known to
speak to his audiences or take a vocal
stand on political issues, he usually
allows his songs to speak for them-
selves; and in his immortal words he
asks, “...how many times must the
cannonballs fly?” showing that his
music, after nearly three decades,

‘Master Harold’ was
a thundering success

By Vic Tchiprout

In conjunction with Black
History Month, the Weis Center
presented South African play-
wright Athol Fugard’s ‘Master
Harold... and the Boys \ast Friday.
Thanks to the Asolo Theatre Com-
pany of Florida, this powerful,
award-winning play was kept in the
original heart-rending level of its
premiere in 1982.

Inspired by his experiences
in racially divided South Africa,
Mr. Fugard casually invites the au-
dience back into 1950 to a small
cozy tea-room in Port Elizabeth.
We meet two of the characters on a
rainy afternoon as they rehearse for
an upcoming ballroom competi-
tion. Sam (Daryl Edwards), and
Willie (Todd Anthony-Jackson) are
the two black tea-room waiters who
work for the parents of a white
South African boy, Hally (Jack
Boslet). The cheerful mood of the
play becomes apparent as the two
waiters josh and chat about their
dancing.

They are soon joined by
Hally, a prep-school boy quickly
venturing into manhood. We im-
mediately become aware of the
close relationship between Sam
and Hally, and, as the drama devel-
ops, we are slowly fed details of the
boy’s childhood experiences with
Sam. The script is so well written
that it’s easy to become engrossed
by the imagery. The stories reveal
the truth of the Hally’s childhood
and how the servants have been like
surrogate fathers to the boy for
many years. We also discover that
Hally’s father is a crippled alco-
holic, a fact which explains Hally’s
apprehension toward him.

The carefree mood of the
play is threatened by a series of
phone calls from Hally’s mother
whereby we learn that his father is
coming home from the hospital.
The bitterness and frustration in
this father-to-son relationship sur-
faces, and Hally is furious with his
racist father. Full of self-pity,
however, he takes his anger out on
Sam in a stream of irrational and
devastating behavior, and the rainy
afternoon climaxes into a threaten-
ing storm. As Sam tries to reason
with and comfort the boy, Hally
bursts into an unstoppable wrath in
which he humiliates the black man
he loves by mocking their years of
friendship and finally, by spitting in
his face. The storm is brought to an
end when the boy insists that his
black servant call him “Master
Harold.”

Contemplating the intensity
of what has happened, we learn to
not only respect others, but our-
selves. It is Hally’s self-hatred that
leads him toward irrational acts, not
only toward his parents, but most
significantly, toward Sam.

Overall, the play was re-
markable as it provided entertain-
ment as well as strong statements
on cultural and social values. Mr.
Fugard deliberately doesn’t pro-
vide an ending to the shocking
story, which leaves the audience to
provide their own after Hally walks
out of the tea-room. The reality and
degree of racial tensions during that
era are obvious in this play. Conse-
quently, today’s modern society
should continue to reflect on that
time, learn from its previous mis-
takes, and attend to it’s current
problems.

Native Americans dance in Williamsport

By Brian Bastress

The American Indian Dance
Theatre, representing some 19 dif-
ferent tribes, reaching from the
Dakotas to the Southwest and from
Canada to the Great Plains, per-
formed at the Capitol Theatre in
Williamsport last Saturday. It is
this country’s first national com-
pany of American Indian dancers
and has proven itself a success
while touring in the United States
as well as in France, Italy, Scot-
land, Japan, the Persian Gulf states,
and North Africa.

Nominated for a 1990
Grammy Award nomination and
featured in a television special en-
titled Great Performances: Dance
in America, the company has pre-
served the authenticity of its cer-
emonial, seasonal, spiritual, and

social dances with the enhancement
of theatrical staging and lighting.
The costumes, ranging from layers
of beads and feathers to simple
buckskins and leggings, are made by
the performers or their families.
Each of the dancers and singers
brings his or her own style to the
production, but by working together,
they have created a company that
shares the rich heritage of its people
with others.

Assistant Professor of Reli-
gion Mary Evelyn Tucker, who at-
tended the show, was impressed by
how the authentic and traditional
dancing and singing of the Indians
“has been preserved in the face of
such awesome odds of poverty and
unemployment”.

John Grim, also of the religion
department, critiqued the perfor-
mance as a “subtle interweaving of

to prove self after four

By Matthew P. Wood

If ever there was a lock, a
sureshot, a staple, a given for a
record label, it is surely a new Sting
album. One can scarcely think of an
artist who has put forth music with
greater consistency, from his years
as the focal point of the Police,
through his solo efforts. The Soul
Cages is Sting’s third solo album,
and it comes an eye-raising four
years after Nothing Like the Sun. The
layoff, Sting says, was the result of a
writer’s block of sorts during which
he nearly panicked. Having obvi-
ously collected himself, he went to
work with some familiar faces,
namely Branford Marsalis and
Kenny Kirkland, and pieced together
The Soul Cages, an album which
shows flashes of brilliance but never
quite fullfills the level of anticipation
that accumulated during his hiatus.

If any one thing seems glar-
ingly absent from this work it is the
alacrity with which Sting usually
performs his music. There is noth-
ing light about this album, and at no
point will one hear something like
The Dream of Blue Turtles con-

cluded with a fit of laughter. As a
matter of fact, the songs are down-
right melancholy and reflective.
Even the seemingly sprite song “All
This Time” consumes itself with
Sting’s loss of his father.

social dance and pow-wow dance”
but emphasized that, even though
the Indian dancing is very beautiful
to watch, the audience should not
lose sight of the pressures they face
such as treaty rights, loss of land,
and efforts to find their sovereign
voice.

Sue Basalla ’92, who spent
her Jan Plan on an Indian reserva-
tion and did not experience any
dance of this sort said, “I felt for-
tunate to see the kind of ceremony
that is private and sacred to the In-
dians.”

The unique performance
concluded with a standing ovation
from the audience, a true indication
of the American Indian Dance
Theatre’s success and their ability
to powerfully display the culture of
the Native Americans.

attempts
year hiatus

But in all fairness to Sting,
there truly is no one comparable to
him musically. Unlike other widely
popular musicians, Sting does not
have a multitude of mimics preying
on his style. This would be rather
easily explained by the fact that
Sting’s music is entirely too ethereal,
refined, and personal to replicate.
Although there are undoubtedly
more talented voices than Sting’s,
there are few song writers that can
match wits with him. Songs like
“Mad About You,” “Why Should I
Cry For You” and “The Soul Cages”
all affirm Sting’s merits not only as
a performer, but also as a song
writer. Even the more hum-drum
tracks, of which there are several,
still contain his unique lyrical flavor.

It is becoming clear that as
Sting grows older, his focus is per-
haps even more on what he is saying
rather than how he is saying it. No
longer are the days when cries of
Roxanne will be heard. Keep this in
mind, and you may find some plea-
sure in The Soul Cages, a very in-
troverted collection of songs.

Staff Writer

The women’s basketball team
will take on the Fordham Lady Rams
today at 3 p.m. in the first round of
the inaugural Patriot League Tour-
nament at the Hart Center on the
campus of the College of the Holy
Cross. Fordham earned the second
seed in the tournament by posting a
9-3 league record, while the Lady
Bison took the seventh seed with a
dismal 1-11 record.

Fordham has beaten Bucknell
twice this year, once in January, 80-
65, and 84-72 on February 16.

Despite their two losses to
Fordham and 1-11 league record,
co-captain Julie Bachman GR thinks
the Lady Bison have a chance.

“The great thing about the
tournament is your season is auto-
matically erased,” said Bachman.
“Fordham was probably the best
possible draw for us because player
for player we match up with them
the best. I really think we can shock
some people.”

Bucknell finished the regular
season against arch-rival Lafayette
on Monday, looking for a litttle mo-
mentum going into this weekend’s
tournament. Bachman provided 18
first-half points including a 4-5
shooting performance from three-
point territory to give Bucknell a six
point lead, 43-37 at the half.

In the first 12 minutes of the
second half, however, the Lady
Leopards fought back with a 30-10
scoring drive, led by Terri Dadio’s
11 points. By the time the dust had
settled, Bucknell was behind 73-58.
Lafayatte held on to the lead and
won the game 88-71.

“We played excellent in the
first half,” said Bachman, “but we
had a total breakdown in the second
half. We never seem to be able to
put two halves together.”

Bucknell’s hopes of climbing
out the basement slipped further
away as they lost their last home
game to Lehigh 79-66 last Saturday.
The Lady Bison matched the Lady
Engineers point for point in the first
half, and were led by eight points
and three steals from Carloine
Shantz ’91.

However, the Lady Bison’s
plague of not being able to string two
halves together caught up with them
once again, as Lehigh scored 17 of
the first 21 points in the second half
to coast to an easy 79-66 victory.

The good news at last
Sunday’s game was the recognition
of four seniors, including two play-
ers and two scorekeepers. Bachman,
one of the honorees and a graduate
student who came back to use up her
final year of eligibility, led the Lady
Bison in scoring this season, averag-
ing approximately 16 points a game.

Also honored was Shantz,

Skiers qualify for nat’l champion-
ships for second straight season

By Susan E. Smith

The Bucknell men’s ski team
qualified last weekend for the Na-
tional Collegiate Ski Association
(NCSA) National Championships
for the second consecutive season
after performing flawlessly at the
Mid-Atlantic Regional Champion-
ships in Seven Springs, PA.

The NCSA constitutes 92 per
cent of all collegiate ski racing, en-
compassing nearly 240 schools
across the nation.

The Bison secured their berth
by earning first place from a field of
twelve schools at regionals. Feb. 23
and 24. The races showcased the top
four teams from three conferences
(Allegheny, New Jersey, and South-
eastern), proving once again Penn-
sylvania schools’ supremacy in
Northeastern NCSA ski racing.

Following Bucknell was
UPenn and Penn State, who finished
second and third respectively, to
give the Allegheny Conference a
sweep of the three berths awarded
for nationals. Two strong schools

Sia

from the Southeastern Conference,
Virginia and Virginia Tech, saw
their hopes dashed by having many
racers fall in the difficult slalom after
skiing well in the previous day’s gi-
ant slalom.

The Bison will travel March
11 to Mount Bachelor in Bend, Or-
egon, for a week of racing against
the nation’s elite. Last year at
Waterville Valley, New Hampshire,
Bucknell concluded its season
ranked 13th in the country, and the
Bison will look to crack the top ten
this year on the West Coast.

Standouts on the men’s team
include Allegheny Conference
Champion Kevin Gawenus 91, and
All-Conference members Rob
Thompson ’91 and Mark Abra-
hamsen °93. J. P. Gallagher ’94,
Brian Swanson "92, Scott Miller 93,
and Scott Pericelli 94 round out the
“A” team, which exhibited strong
depth all season.

The Lady Bison, who in 1990
ranked 15th in the nation, were
decimated in 1991 by the graduation
or transfers of many of last year’s

key skiers. Moreover, women’s
team captain Christine Ralston ’92
this month sustained an injury to her
anterior cruciate ligament, tearing
her knee in the final weekend of
races in the regular season.

The women’s team barely
missed qualifying for regionals after
placing fifth in the conference dur-
ing the regular season. Nevertheless,
Ralston and Sarah McCahill ’93 had
outstanding seasons, attaining All-
Conference honors.

The Lady Bison had three
skiers—Kate Fink *93, Elyse Knut-
son ’93 and Kerry Marks ’94—who
experienced racing for the first time
in their skiing careers. They provide
youth and potential that will keep the
women’s team competitive for the
next several years.

Highlights and lowlights were
plentiful for the successful club sport
this season. Practice opened in upper
New England this year with a train-
ing week in the biting cold and wind
at Smuggler’s Notch, Vermont.

The trip was beneficial to
many, as first-year racer Fink attrib-

uted much of her success this season
to the instruction and guidance at-
tained during the opening week. “It
really made the difference in my
racing,” said Fink. “All the indi-
vidual attention I received from the
instructors was a great help. They
taught me the proper timing and
edging for my turns.”

Fink added, “Running the
gates every day against our main ri-
vals, UPenn [who were also training
in Vermont), gave us an edge during
the regular season.

Another turning point of the
year was the addition of Thompson,
who returned from a January teach-
ing internship halfway through the
season. The conference’s number-
five skier sent a message to the rest
of the league immediately by win-
ning his first race at Eagle Rock, PA,
after returning from his month-long
hiatus. That race also rewrote the
Bucknell history books, as Thomp-
son, Gawenus, and Abrahamsen
finished one-two-three in a field of
over sixty racers, marking the first
time Bucknell has placed the top
three skiers in an event.

The “Road to Oregon” wasn’t
without some bumpy rides however.
On the way to practice three weeks
ago, the ski team’s University-
owned van skidded, rolled off the
road, and ultimately ran into a tree
because of the inclement weather.
Miraculously, injuries were very
minor, and the team was undaunted,
as it stayed focused for the crucial
regional races.

The College of Idaho won last
year’s national championship, but
this season it appears that Western
State College (Colo.) is the team to
beat. It placed second in 1990.

Bucknell’s ski team is cur-
rently meeting with many University
organizations in order to raise fund-
ing for many financial obligations,
including air fare, lodging, and reg-
istration fees.

Gawenus noted, “Making na-
tionals was something that we had
been aiming at all season. Now
maybe Bucknell will take this club
sport seriously. Right now, however,
we’re having trouble getting them
[the University] to help pay for our
trip.”

If the Universisty can finance
the trip, it will provide a once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity for many of
these athletes.

who came on strong in the latter half
of the season with solid backcourt
play. She leaves Bucknell placed
fifth on the all-time assists list.
Others recognized at the game were
seniors Jenny Clark and Kathy

Schulte for their services to the team.

“It was a neat experience
playing acollege sport,” said Shantz,
“and I’m really glad I got a chance
to do it. It was great playing with

Julie, and I think we tried our best.”

Grapplers win two

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

The Bison grapplers continued
to show signs of dramatic improve-
ment last weekend by defeating
Central Connecticut and Hofstra
University. The victories are com-
ing at a key point in the season for
Bucknell (8-8), as the East Coast
Wrestling Association (ECWA)
championships draw closer, and the
team’s confidence level is at it’s
highest point to date.

The team headed to Central
Connecticut on Friday, where the
Bison scraped out a 23-19 victory
over the perennially tough confer-
ence team.

Previously, coach Bob Ferraro
had said that the Bison would have
to do everything right to defeat
Central Connecticut. His prophecy
proved true as the Bison needed
some key wins to pull off the upset.
Phil Elliot ’93 wrestling to a 4-4
draw was, according to Ferraro, an
“extremely important point in the
victory.”

The key win, however, be-
longed to Mike Van Doren ’92, who
was wrestling at 150 Ibs. when he
defeated his opponent 13-0. The
victory sparked the Bison and, ac-
cording to Ferraro, “put the team
back on track.”

One of the unfortunate mo-
ments for the Bison occurred when
Chris Ducas ‘91 (126 Ibs.), was
pinned by his opponent after leading
for most of the match. Ferraro,
however, believes that the winner of
that match will be the number one
ranked wrestler in the conference.

The Bison then headed to
Hofstra, where they trounced their
Overmatched opponent, 37-8.
Ferraro had remarked that Hofstra
did not have the balance that Central
Connecticut did, and this clearly
contributed to their downfall.

The victory was characterized
by a consistent effort on the part of
the entire Bison team. Winners for
the Bison included Ducas, Elliot,
Van Doren, Mike Salone '92, and
Tom Marchetti 91. A draw was
credited to heavyweight Ben Myers
“91 as well.

The two matches over the
weekend may prove to be the driving
force that will propel the team to an
ECWA championship. Ferraro was
pleased with the Bison performance
because, in effect, the victories could
not have been written any better.
“We did what we had to do to win.”

Bucknell’s ability to accom-
plish this in the future may be the
deciding factor when the ECWA’s
arrive. It is then that the Bison will
be forced to face their fiercest rival,
Rider College. According to
Ferraro, in order to beat them, “the
other teams will have to beat out
some of their guys.”

While the victories over the
weekend may provide the catalyst
for the streaking Bison team, Ferraro
would like to think the road trip to
California earlier in the year made
the difference. “There is no question
in my mind that the difficulty of our
non-conference schedule prepared
us for the rest of the season.”

While many were quick to
criticize the Bison for their 4-8
record after the trip, Ferraro’s an-
swer comes in the form of the Bison
late season surge. “We will continue
to wrestle tough non-conference
teams at the start of the season. We
are without a doubt ready for the
championships.”

The Bison grapplers appear to
be finishing strong and riding on a
wave of confidence based on their
weekend victories. With the
ECWA’s directly around the corner
and the prospects of facing Rider
fairly high, the Bison will once again
need to make all the right moves to
finish the season strong.

Bucknell will now face top-
seeded Fordham today at 5:15 p.m.
for the right to play in the ESPN-
televised tournament final tomorrow
afternoon. The Rams knocked off
the Bison in their two meetings ear-
lier this season, by six points each
time.

“Coming into this tournament
we had hoped to get another crack at
them,” commented Woollum at the
post-game conference.

Courtney went on to add,
“This game was a good test before
Fordham because Army is a very
good defensive team.”

Bucknell split its final two
regular season games played earlier
this week.

Last Saturday, Lehigh handed
the Bison their fifth conference loss
98-87 in front of a standing-room-
only crowd in Davis Gym. The win
was the Engineers’ fifth straight
against Bucknell.

Malik Malone '91, Keith
Fenton ‘91, and _ Leshinski

Hockey finishes frustrating
year without playoff berth

By Jen Walsh
Staff Writer

After a long, frustrating sea-
son of mishaps, what the Bucknell
ice hockey team really needed. was
to play one last game. One last game
where it could pound the other team
intg the boards and run up the score.

But what the Bison hockey
team lacked last Sunday was a team
to play against.

It was somehow ironic—or
perhaps very fitting—that Bucknell
should win its last game by forfeit
over Georgetown, which could not
get enough players together to field
ateam. That also became a chronic
problem for the Bucknell hockey
team in the middle of its season and
grew worse as the year wore on.

The Bison skaters finished the
year with a respectable record of
eight wins and six losses, but failed
to make the playoffs for the second
straight year. This time, however,
the idea of not participating in the
post-season must be particularly

painful. It is one thing to miss the
playoffs because you have a lousy
team; it is another to miss them be-
cause of lousy circumstances.

Bucknell finished the month
of January with a record of 5-1, but
lost five of its next eight games in
the month of February. The losses
were almost entirely due to Bucknell
players not being able to show up for
games, rather than a lack of ability
to score or defend.

The team was talented
enough, having just the right blend
of goal-scorers, playmakers, and
strong defense—even a bit of speed
and toughness, but none of that made
any difference when enough players
did not show.

“Tt was definitely an interest-
ing season,” said co-captain John
Guelcher ‘91. “It was so up and
down. Some games were great, some
games were frustrating. I guess most
of all it was a season of frustration.”

But surely the most frustrating
aspect of the year for the hockey
team had to be the game they lost to

Gettysburg just over a weck ago,
during which Bucknell almost won,
with less than seven skaters on its
team. It turned out that, had the team
been able to win that game, the Bi-
son would have made the playoffs
and had their shot at the champion-
ship.

However, it was not to be, and
so for now all the hockey team can
do is look to the future.

“Next year there should be a
much better team than this year,”
said Guelcher. “We're only losing
three or four really good people, and
we should have another good fresh-
man class—they seem to get stron-
ger every year.”

Co-captain Carl Zuckerberg
“91 called it “a fun season”, and
pointed out that events such as rush,
which will be held in the fall next
year, won’t interfere with the
schedule again. The players also ac-
knowledged their appreciation for
the fan support over the season, and
conclude by saying that they are
“still committed.”

Women swimmers return from
Easterns after decent showing

By Mitch Benton
Staff Writer

Four members of the women’s
swimming and diving team com-
peted at the Eastern Intercollegiate
Swimming and Diving Champion-
ships last weekend at Princeton
University. The invitational meet,
which brings together top swimmers
who have met qualifying times dur-
ing the season, was won convinc-
ingly by Harvard University with
558 points, followed by Penn State
with 527, and host Princeton with
473.

The Bison foursome, whose
teammates did not score at last
year’s event, placed 19th in the field
of 34, with a total 41 points. The
outstanding swimmer of the meet
was Lisa Flood of sixth-place
Villanaova, while the high scorer of
the competition was Princeton’s

Nathalie Wunderlich.

Bucknell’s scoring was led by
sophomore Margaret Grunow, who
captured fourteen points for her
tenth-place finishes in both the 50-
and 100-yard freestyles. Grunow’s
time in the 50 free, 24.05, broke her
own Bucknell all-time record,while
her finish in the 100 free barely
missed another school record.

Other points won for the Bison
came from the relay teams. The 200-
yard freestyle relay team of Grunow,
Kathaleen Hartnett ‘94, Kelly
Appler ‘91, and Andrea Falcione ‘92
finished eleventh in the competition.
Their time of 1:38.32 was just 42
hundredths slower then the school
record set by the same foursome at
the Patriot League Championships,
held earlier this month.

Other scoring relays for the
team were the 400 and 200-yard
medley relay teams, which finished

thirteenth in both events and swam
slightly slower then the school
records that were also set at the
championships.

The excitement of the perfor-
mances turned in by these swimmers
was echoed by the co-captain,
Appler. “We were all really happy
with our times, especially in the re-
lays. Even though we didn’t set any
records, the [time] splits were great.”

The Men’s Eastern
Intercollegiate Championships will
be held this weekend, also at
Princeton. Bucknell’s men’s squad
will look to better its 20th place fin-
ish at last year’s event. Don Steenson
“92, unbeaten this year in the 200
yard backstroke, and Jay Gross ‘93,
who won league titles in the 50-yard
freestyle and the 200-yard back-
stroke, will be competing for the
Bison.

Women have always spoken out against injustice.
Yet, 9 out of 10 women raped on campus dont say a word.

Maybe it’s because most campus rapes are committed by someone the victim knows, so
she may think it doesn't count. ;
Except, no one asks for rape. And no one has the right to force you into sex against your will.
So if this has happened to you, please report it. :
Because after all the strides women have made, you can't afford to lose your voice now.

A Bucknell Invitational is in
the works for some time in April,
which will hopefully give the stu-

Ultimately, the Bison hope to finish
in the top two teams in the division

If you thought that finding a color
Macintosh" system you could afford

was just a dream, then the nevy, affordable Macintosh LC is a dream

come true.

The Macintosh LC is rich in color. Unlike many computers that can display
only 16 colors at once, the Macintosh LC expands your palette to 256 colors.
Italso comes with a microphone and new sound input technology that lets
you personalize your work by adding voice or other sounds.

Like every Macintosh computer, the LC is easy to set up and easy to
master. And it runs thousands of available applications that all work in the
same, consistent way—so once you've learned one program, you're well
on your way to learning them all. The Macintosh LC even lets you share infor
mation with someone who uses a different type of computer—thanks to
the versatile Apple® SuperDrive” which can read from and write to Macintosh,

MS-DOS, OS, 2, and Apple II floppy disks.

Take a look at the Macintosh LC and see what it gives you. Then pinch

Bison dominate track chine ga som

Men win their tenth straight indoor title while the women place second, just 18 points behind Fordham

By Chris Drowne
Staff Writer

Despite popular opinion, the
phrase, “the more things change, the
more they stay the same,” can be
applied to indoor track and field.
The league, field houses, and most

of the opponents are different, but
the result is the same. Bucknell’s
men won the inaugural Patriot
League Indoor Track and Field
Championships at the Sanford Field
House at Colgate University last
weekend. The Lady Bison finished a
close second, only 18 points back.

Bucknellian File Photo

The men’s indoor track and field won their tenth straight league
championship last weekend at Colgate University. Bucknell domi-
nated all aspects of the meet, beating second-place Fordam by 88

points.

Before the two-day event was over,
18 field house records were broken.
Seven of the records were broken by
Bison runners.

Eight first-place finishes and
numerous other point-earning per-
formances in 17 events carried the
Bison men to their tenth straight in-
door title (the previous nine coming
as a member of the East Coast Con-
ference). Only Fordham, who won
the women’s title, offered the men
token pressure.

The opening field events en-
abled both the men’s and women’s
teams to separate themselves from
the lesser talented squads.

“We set the tone early.” said
Head Coach Art Gulden.

Paul Austin 91 captured both
the 35-pound weight and shot put
competitions with ease, setting a
school record of 57’ 2.5” in weight.
Scott Croasdale 93 and Pete Gre-
gory 93 also scored in those events.

The high jump saw Dawn
Ellery ’94 gain top honors with a
jump that broke a field house record
while Blaine Fawcett ’93 and John
Plante °94 finish second and fifth,
respectively, for the men.

The Lady Bison, who finished
second in last year’s ECC indoor
championships, dominated the long
and triple jumps.

Co-captain Lynette McBride
’91 completed an undefeated season
in the long jump with her 17’ 11”
effort. Lynda Rose ’92 and Jenny
Thomas °94 finished first and third
in the triple jump, respectively.

Jeff Schild 92 wrapped up the
Bison’s field dominance with his
pole vault of 14’ 6”. Joe LaBarge 93
finished third and Brett Karcher ’93
fourth.

business,” picking up where their

Volleyball begins inaugural
season by winning five of six

By Mike Lutz and
Rob Winchell

The Bucknell men’s volley-
ball team has started off their first
season with a convincing record of
4-1 in the league and 5-1 overall.

This past weekend, under the
leadership of newly acquired coach
Ann Marie Larese, the team traveled
to Susquehanna University, where
the Bison scored convincing wins
over Susquehanna and an overcon-
fident Bloomsburg University team.

Competing at home on Sun-
day, the team was not as fortunate,
however, defeating Shippensburg
University B in three straight games
but falling to a powerful
Shippensburg A team in four games.

Last Sunday’s game was the
club’s first home match in history
and was attended by a small but en-
thusiastic crowd of fans. While the
B team easily defeated Shippens-
burg, the Bison A team was plagued
with inconsistent play in their defeat
to the team from Shippensburg.

After losing the first game
13-15, the Bison rebounded to
dominate the second. game 15-6.
Bucknell then fell victim to sloppy
play in the final two games as
Shippensburg went on to win the
match three games to one.

“A lot of us were tired from
our two tough matches on Saturday,”
commented Ben Jarosz ‘94. “We
were on a high after coming from
behind and beating Bloomsburg, and
we just sort of let down.”

The day before, the squad
faced a relatively weak team from
Susquehanna in its first match.
Playing a best-of-three format, the
Bison cruised to easy 15-6 and 15-5
victories.

The Bison were faced with a
tough Bloomsburg team in the sec-
ond match of the day, however, and
lost the first game of the match S—
15. Bloomsburg soon lost its com-
posure in the face of an undaunted
Bucknell squad though, and the Bi-

son pummeled their opponents in the
next two games, 15-4 and 15-S.

The key to the tum-around,
according to Mike Lutz ’94, was that
“we just didn’t give up. The coach
made a key substitution, we were
able to turn things around, and then
we never looked back.”

This is the team’s first year in
the Eastern Intercollegiate Volley-
ball Association (EIVA), which in-
cludes teams from all along the east
coast. The present organization was

founded last year by Brad Wealand
“93 and Paul Ridder ‘93, and has
grown considerably. Still in the
building stages, the teant has already
figured to be a powerhouse in central
Pennsylvania.

The young 13-man team starts
four freshmen and two sophomores
with only one senior and one junior
on the team and has already scored
convincing wins over Lehigh,

teammates left off with men’s victo-
ries in the 55, 800, 3000, and 5000-
meter events, as well as in the mile.
The women took first in the 55-
meter dash and hurdles and in the
200-meter dash.

Norbert Berenyi ’91 led the
always dominant distance runners
with top finishes in the mile and 800-
meter races.

His victory in the mile was
exciting as he came-from-behind to
win in an outstanding field. Jeff
Loomis *92 and Tom Eagleson ’93
kept pace with Berenyi in the mile,
finishing second and fourth, respec-
tively. Dave Slupe °93 grabbed
bronze in the 800.

Jason Cahilly ’92 won the
Gold metal in the 5000-meter in a
record time of 14:54.24 as team-
mates Bob Kelly ’92, David Howard
*93 and Todd Vincent ’92 took three
of the next five slots.

The 3000-meter was also
packed with Bison as Matt Deardorff
°92, Tom Wuchenich ’92 and Judd
Jordan ’93 crossed the finish line 1-
3-5.

Jim Bock ’92 sprinted to vic-
tory in the 55-meter dash with Henry
Ramsey °92 taking fourth.

The women also picked up a
first in the 55-meter dash courtesy of
junior Tricia Plasko’s ECAC quali-
fying time of 7.33. McBride finished
second, just .02 seconds back.

Plasko also won the 200-meter
dash in 25.80 seconds which set an-
other Bucknell record. Dana Harbst
93, Audra Wilson '94, and Julie
Diercks ’93 took places four through
six, respectively.

The 55-meter hurdles title
went to Karen Shimomura 91,
whose time of 8:41 also qualified her
for ECAC’s. Carla DeBiasi ’94 also
scored in the event with her fifth-
place finish.

While the men didn’t win the
55-meter hurdles competition, they
did manage to dominate it. Jean
Simon °94, Mark Barolo ’93,
Fawcett and Tri-Captain Paul
Houchens ’91 captured second
through fifth places, respectively.

meter dash, all placed in the top six
for the men.

For the women sprinters Wil-
son in the 400-meter dash, co-cap-
tain Allison Saeger °91 in the 500-
meter dash, and Kathy Wurster 94
and Diana Dittmann ’92 in the 800-
meter dash, accomplished the same
feat.

The Lady Bison also received
points from distance runners Kristin
Opdyke ’93 in the 3000-meter, Kelly
Marsh ’91 and Helene Weiting ’91
in the 5000-meter, and Gina
Abraham ’93 in the 1000-meter.

In the relay events, both dis-
tance medley teams finished third.
The men’s 4x400 and 4x800-meter
squads also finished third while the

women picked up silver metals in
both.

“I was really pleased with both
teams. We came ready. Our kids
work harder than everyone else.
Their work ethic in day to day prac-
tice showed. There were no disap-
pointments, ” added Gulden.

The men’s team is ready to
bring its dominance outside. The
women’s squad may be just a few
good throwers away from surpassing
Fordham for a tide.

As to whether or not these
outstanding indoor performances
actually do result in outdoor cham-
pionships this spring, only time will
Teally tell. But, we know better. “The
more things change, the more they
stay the same.”

Alumni return to Davis Gym

Stars from yesteryear return for peta be annual game

By Brad Tufts

Despite frequent admonitions
that the past is behind us, Bucknell
basketball fans were given a glimpse
of years gone by when the Second
Annual Bison Basketball Alumni
Game was played last Saturday af-
ternoon.

Five of the school’s 18 1,000-
point career scorers took part in the
game and the fans were treated to a
wide open affair that ended in a 111-
99 victory for the White team over
the Blue team.

Leading the way for the vic-
tors was Mike Joseph ‘90, who
picked up where he left off last sea-
son by hitting six of seven shots from
three-point range on his way to
scoring a game-high 30 points. The
two-time All-ECC guard also hit all
four of his free throws, and most
observers wouldn’t be surprised if he
doesn’t miss a free throw until well
into the next century.

Bob Barry ’80, also a two-time
All-ECC selection, registered the
optician’s special with 20 points and
20 rebounds and played the first
game witnessed by his four-month-
old son, Bobby, who already looks
like he’ll be formidable in the pivot
for the 2009-10 Bison.

Also in double figures for the
White, who shot a creditable 48
percent from the field, were Gerald
Purnell ’78, who was the first Bison
junior ever to hit 1,000 points, with
11 points, and Harvey Edwards ’78,
John Callaway ’78, and Roger Clark
”78 each had ten points. Ed Sigl ’84
had eight points, 14 boards and five

Employment prospects decline

By Travis Elliott
Staff Writer

Bucknell seniors are encoun-
tering more difficulty than usual
finding jobs this year due to corpo-
rate cutbacks in the face of reces-
sion. Corporate recruiters have
cancelled 45 to 50 on-campus job
interview sessions so far this aca-
demic year, up from the average 30
to 35 cancellation, according to the
Director of the Career Develop-
ment Center, Mark Kerr.

Kerr said, “The job market is
indeed down this year. Many em-
ployers can’t make a commitment
to as many people. We are in a de-
pressed market as it relates to job
opportunities, but I like to remain

cautiously optimistic.”

According to the Collegiate
Employment Research Institute at
Michigan State University, employ-
ers will hire 9.8 percent fewer new
college graduates this spring as
compared with a year ago.

Kerr explained that in the past,
most companies have cancelled their
on-campus recruiting sessions be-
cause they didn’t have students who
were interested, but many are now
cancelling because they don’t have
the opportunities to offer.

Julie Shurilla ’91 has been
searching for a job with magazine
publishing companies, but as of yet,
she has been unable to secure an in-
terview. She said, “Many of the
bigger magazines have had a hiring

support the test, which will deter-
mine whether a person has con-
tracted the HIV virus. ‘There are a
lot of advantages to knowing
whether you’re positive,” said
Preston Hoyle, director of Student
Medical Services.

The tests will be given by two
individuals who work at AIDS test-
ing clinics and who have provided
the same services to area universities
such as Susquehanna and
Bloomsburg. Rick Schultz, a public
health program representative from
Williamsport, and Judith Polites, a
community health nurse and AIDS
prevention program coordinator
from Danville, will administer the
test independent of the University’s
medical center.

As part of the program,
Schultz and Polites will very likely
provide counseling, according to
Hoyle, who had not actually dis-
cussed the matter with them. “I’m
assuming they are probably going to
do some pre- and post-test counsel-
ing,” he said.

Molly Swart ’92, the repre-
sentative of FLAG who initially
discussed the testing with Hoyle,
also expects the program to include
counseling. “I know these people
will come back to give the results,”
she said, suggesting that some coun-
seling will take place then.

The test will be completely
anonymous and confidential. Al-
though no definite procedure for
carrying out the test has been deter-
mined, the testing will be run
through the Student Medical Center.
“People will call for an appointment
and will not give a name. They will
be given a time, perhaps a number,”

sponses required interviewing at a
company’s branch office and not
on campus.

Kerr noted that a number of
corporations are trying to condense
the interviewing process and re-
duce some of the expenses nor-
mally related with second inter-
views, such as travel expenses. He

had violated team policy, the women
“should not have been subjected to
the potential disciplinary action of
not being allowed to ride home on
the team bus.”

Hartzell admitted that
Howard’s “very poor decision” cre-
ated a potentially disastrous liability
situation for the University. “It’s
{the coaching staff’s] responsibility
to be sure all team members get to
the contest and get home safely.
And it is an understood responsibil-
ity that they see to it that the safety
and well-being of the student-ath-
letes is first and foremost,” ex-
plained Hartzell.

“Our team members are like
our families,” said Hartzell. “They
should know and follow rules; how-
ever, if rules are broken, they are not
to be abandoned.”

The coaches in question have
been instructed by Hartzell to submit
“written letters of apology to stu-
dent-athletes and the parents in-
volved in this matter.”

Concerning team animosity,
co-captain Julie Bachman GR said,
“There has been a negative attitude
towards the coach, as well as a total
lack of respect for her, and perhaps
vice versa.”

This

incident prompted

Hartzell to state that “a complete and
in-depth review of all aspects of the
women’s basketball program will
begin immediately.”

According to Hartzell, the
evaluation process that is to begin
next week will include several con-
fidential meetings with the players.
In addition, anonymous question-
naires will be issued to this season’s
team members, alumni who played
for Howard, as well as those who
quit prior to graduation and those
who were recruited by the coaching
staff yet decided not to play.

The evaluation process will
also give the members of the coach-
ing staff an opportunity to speak on
their behalf, noted Hartzell. He
imagines the entire process will take
approximately one month.

Hartzell’s statement was made
following an investigation of the in-
cident. The investigation revealed
that the four players were observed
Friday evening by team coaches
consuming alcohol in a hotel
room—a violation of Howard’s
policy. At that time Howard in-
formed the players that they would
not be allowed to return to Lewis-
burg on the team bus the following
morning.

Shantz, thinking Howard

would reconsider her decision,
showed up for the bus and asked her
coach for permission to ride back
with the team,

Once again, Howard refused
and suggested that the players re-
ceive transportation from
Dunleavy’s parents, who were also
in Worcester for the tournament.
Dunleavy commented to the Lewis-
burg Daily Journal that she and the
other players “asked three times if
we could get on the bus, and she said
absolutely not.”

The players were reportedly
denied meal money for the day and
were stranded in the hotel lobby af-
ter having already checked out of
their rooms.

Dunleavy was able to contact
her parents, and despite their plans
to spend the weekend in Boston, the
Dunleavys provided transportation
for the four players.

The remainder of the team left
on the University bus while the
coaching staff provided their own
transportation. As the bus pulled
away, the final four players stayed in
the lobby awaiting Dunleavy’s par-
ents.

Howard was unavailable for
commentand did not retum any calls
from The Bucknellian.

Faculty rejects motion
to sever ties with ROTC

By Mark Leister
Staff Writer

In a 70-30 secret ballot vote,
the faculty decided on Monday to
retain Bucknell’s Army Reserve
Officer Training Corps. While re-
jecting the initial motion to abolish
the program, the faculty instead
passed an alternative motion calling
for Bucknell to begin formal lobby-
ing against the Department of
Defense’s discriminatory policies.

The faculty’s majority vote
defeated last month’s motion intro-
duced by George Jenks, collection
development librarian. Jenks called
for the complete severing of ties with
the ROTC program on grounds that
its policies are discriminatory and its
curriculum “teaches the art of kill-
ing.”

Prior to the vote, three faculty
members read prepared statements
in opposition to the motion. Marg-
aret Kastner, associate professor of
chemistry, was the first to express
her dissent. She encouraged the re-
tention of ROTC stating that “if we
are to encourage diversity at Buck-
nell, we should encourage programs
:and activities that add to that diver-
sity and continue our educational
goals.”

Dick Henry, professor of
physics, was similarly dissatisfied
with Jenks’ motion. Henry stated
that the removal of ROTC would be
“antithetical to the philosophy of a
liberal education.”

A motion for a secret ballot
vote was then accepted and the votes
were tallied. Of the 100 faculty
members who chose to vote, nearly
three-quarters sided against severing
ties with the ROTC program.

Immediately following the
defeat of Jenks’ motion, Nancy
Caine, associate professor of psy-
chology and a representative of the
Feminist Women’s Caucus, intro-
duced an alternative four-element
motion to the faculty.

The FWC first moved that
Bucknell join national educational
groups in lobbying for changes in
Department of Defense policies
which discriminate against homo-
sexuals and bisexuals; second, that
the University explore ways to for-
mally protest the Armed Forces’
discrimination of women; and third,

that all Bucknell literature include a
disclaimer that ROTC contradicts
the University’s nondiscriminatory
policy.

The faculty then amended the
fourth section to state that Bucknell
should disassociate itself from
ROTC if the Department of Defense
does not eliminate its discriminatory
policy within three years.

After a short debate, however,
the faculty decided in a 57-30 vote
that the fourth element should be
eliminated altogether and the
amended, three-section motion was
passed.

In response to the removal of
the disassociation clause, Caine
stated that the motion’s authors

“knew it was the most controversial”
part but they felt that “it made the
motion a stronger one.”

Despite his belief that the mo-
tion was “gutted” by the disassocia-
tion clause’s removal, Jenks said he
voted for the second motion. Con-
cerning the defeat of his earlier mo-
tion, however, he remained optimis-
tic. “I didn’t expect the motion to
pass; it came out better than I
thought it would be.”

After the meeting, President
Gary Sojka said he “was not un-
happy” with the faculty’s decision to
pass the second motion. “I was told
to do what I would anyway — lobby
to change Department of Defense
policies which are blatantly dis-
criminatory.”

Employment

From page 1

said, “To save expense and time,
many employers will be performing
second interviews on-campus during
their second day on campus.”

Kraus explained that out of 3
on-campus interviews, he had still
received no offers.

Kerr also explained that many
companies want to see what happens
in the first quarter of 1991 after the

Persian Gulf crisis. He noted, how-
ever, that some fields continue to do
well. Engineering, computer-related
jobs, and accounting have not done
as poorly as other fields.

He said, “I believe the reces-
sion won’t continue into the long-
term. By next fall or next spring, the
job situation should improve and
hopefully we will have a fuller re-
cruiting schedule.”

AIDS testing

From page 1

Hoyle said, speculating as to the ar-
rangements.

Hoyle emphasized that al-
though the test will be administered
at the medical center, the results will
remain confidential. “[The students]
will present themselves and be di-
rected back to the area where they’ Il
do the testing. That will be it as far
as we’re concerned. There will be
no notations on their health records;
they will not be identified as having
been in,” he said.

The test, Hoyle speculated,
will be-a standard blood test. Blood
samples will be sent to a commercial
lab, which will examine them using
the ELISA test.

Hoyle pointed out that in any
medical test, the possibility of a false
reading exists. He said, however,
only the “state of the art” tests will
be used. Any sample testing positive
for the HIV virus will be subjected
to the Western blot test, a common
procedure in AIDS testing.

Aside from simple curiosity,
an individual may want to be tested
for the AIDS virus for several rea-
sons. Hoyle said that early detection
may be a key. “Taking medication
seems to delay the onset of full-
blown AIDS,” he said, referring to
AZT, the drug which often prolongs
the lives of people who have con-
tracted the virus.

Detecting the disease in its
early stages then “makes testing a
more valuable thing. It has some
positive things like finding out you
can begin some medication that will
delay the onset of the illness,” Hoyle
said.

Although several campus or-
ganizations support the testing,
Swart said that FLAG will try to
down-play its involvement in an at-
tempt to attract more students to the
test. ““We want people to know [the
testing] is not just for homosexuals.
It’s for anybody who is in a high risk
category for catching AIDS,” Swart
continued.

Two names were accidentally omitted from Phi Gamma Delta’s
1991 pledge list in an article entitled “Fraternities announce new 1991

Incidents of retail theft
increase at bookstore

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

A Bucknell student was
charged with retail theft by East
Buffalo Township Police last month
after switching price tags on mer-
chandise in the University Book-
store. The incident highlights a re-
cent increase in retail theft on the
Bookstore, according to Robert
Gramley, East Buffalo Township
police chief. Vince DeCerchio, di-
rector of security and safety, also
called retail theft “a serious prob-
lem.”

According to police and secu-
rity reports, one student was charged
with retail theft following an inci-
dent on February 26. The student
picked up a specially-ordered book,
priced at $51.50 at the textbook of-
fice and then proceeded to the text-
book area, where he was seen hold-
ing a used Education book.

When a Bookstore employee
went to see if he needed assistance,
he left the textbook section of the
store and entered the stationary and
supplies area. After the student went
through the checkout, employees
examined his receipt and found that
the only textbook charged was a
used text for $24.25, the same price
as the Education book he was seen
holding. Investigation also revealed
one of the copies of the Education
book on the shelf did not have a price
tag.

The student later admitted to
the summary offense, which can
carry a fine of up to $300, as well as
restitution. The case has not yet
reached District Justice Leo
Armbruster.

Gramley said the arrest of the
student “was the biggest [arrest]
we’ve had in quite a while.”

DeCerchio admitted that
“there is a lot of petty theft” in the
bookstore, with many of the inci-
dents involving merchandise priced

under one dollar. “People seem to
think it’s OK,” DeCerchio said,
“they don’t regard that kind of petty
theft as a crime. The problem is they
fail to realize that shrinkage [retail
and internal theft] has been known
to actually close or bankrupt some
large stores.”

According to DeCerchio, there
were 31 incidents during the last four
months which involved shoplifting
or “product tampering,” opening
or eating merchandise, or moving it
to another area with intent to remove
it from the store.

DeCerchio noted that many
were items of low value. Of the
ten incidents in December, he ex-
plained, “most of these were be-
tween five and fifty dollars,” and that
the two arrests in November were for
a theft of thirteen dollars and under
one dollar. With these figures,
DeCerchio also said, “I suspect
we’re only catching ten percent” of
all thefts.

DeCerchio also explained that
Pennsylvania law dictates that “all
shoplifters are arrested, finger-
printed and prosecuted,” regardless
of the value of the theft. He said that
the law helps find repeat offenders,
by ensuring that their past shoplift-
ing incidents will be documented.
Gramley explained that retail theft is
a summary offense for a first of-
fense, but that it becomes a
misdemeanor if a national check re-
veals prior shoplifting convictions.

DeCerchio said “‘we’re look-
ing at a number of different things”
to combat the problem, including
“increased surveillance, stricter in-
ventory procedures or an education
program for the Bucknell commu-
nity” about the hidden cost of shop-
lifting which “everybody pays.” He
noted that “we haven’t looked at any
stronger measures, in part because of
the University belief “that we should
be investing our energies in trusting

people.”

Lack of parking creates |
problems for students

By Marjorie Stinchcombe

Having trouble finding a
parking space? If the answer is yes,
you are not alone. There seem to be
too many cars and too few spaces.
One student, Rachel Gusset ’93,
says, “I have a lot of trouble finding
a parking spot. Usually it is just
easier to walk.” Her sentiment is
echoed by many. Other frequent
complaints are that even with a
parking sticker, it is impossible to
find a convenient parking space. The
result is that many students are park-
ing illegally, and they are being
ticketed even though they have paid
$25 to register their car.

What is the University reac-

tion to the parking crunch? Accord-
ing to Richard McGinnis, chairman
of the parking committee, “There are
enough parking spaces on campus to
accommodate all the cars, but not all
spaces are equally used.” For in-
stance, the parking lot by the sta-
dium is rarely full. .

McGinnis notes that there has
been an increase.in the number of
Cars registered, but there is also a
new lot by the Lambda Chi Alpha
house. Furthermore, he believes that
the parking problem will increase in
severity over the next few years
when an increased number of staff
and students bring cars to campus.
There is no quota, however, on the
number of parking stickers issued.

Alternative plans such as a
lottery for stickers, have been
deemed unfair. McGinnis realizes
that many students need to have a car
on campus for job or travel purposes.
But the University is not planning on
building any more parking lots. With
regard to complaints about fines,
McGinnis says, “We did a survey
three years ago, and we found in or-
der for the fine to be effective, it
must be at least ten dollars. Anything
less that did not deter students.”
There is also currently a process by
which students can appeal what they
feel is an unfair ticket.

There do not seem to be any
quick and easy solutions to students’
parking woes. Security is currently

trying to crack down on freshmen
with cars on campus. Besides stricter
enforcement, however, there is little
to be done about the parking di-
lemma. Not every student will be
able to find a convenient parking
space, and this dilemma undoubt-
edly diminishes the vaiue of having
acar on campus for some students.

McGinnis advises students to
walk to class and the library, and to
try to park in under-used parking lots
such as the Stadium lot. There is no
solution to the parking dilemma, but
it seems that students may have to
realize as one Bucknell official said,
“We don’t have a parking problem,
we have a walking problem.”

State law requires University
to follow recycling regulations

By Timothy W. Kirk

Bucknell University is now
engaged in the final stages of a four-
phased recycling program to comply
with Pennsylvania Act 101. Recy-
cling coordinator Penny Puskarich
92 warns we are in a critical phase
of the recycling program, and that
the University has been given a
mandate to comply with all state
regulations by September, 1991.

Establishing guidelines for
cities, towns, and local municipali-
ties, the Municipal Waste Planning,
Recycling, and Waste Reduction Act
of 1988 also requires programs for
“schools, school districts, and insti-
tutions of higher learning.” Accord-
ing to Puskarich, Bucknell’s pro-
gram will be in full compliance with
the act by September.

The school has been following
the four-phased plan, designed by
Puskarich, since spring, 1990. Be-
ginning with the education and par-
ticipation of University administra-
tion, faculty, and support staff, the
plan sought to construct a firm base
from which recycling awareness
would permeate throughout the en-
tire campus. Curriculum pertaining
to recycling and environmental
awareness was incorporated into this
past summer’s training program for
Resident Assistants, the Freshmen
Orientation program, and various
other student service programs.
Placement of recycling receptacles
and bins around campus completed
the second phase.

This semester marks the be-
ginning of the third and most ag-
gressive phase of the plan. By the

March 11-12th

DATE

eae=z-~—

end of Spring semester all residence,
office, classroom, laboratory, and
athletic facilities will be equipped
with recycling receptacles and will
be serviced by separate collection of
recyclable materials. Fraternities
have been instructed to submit recy-
cling proposals and to begin imple-
mentation of approved programs
immediately. Representatives from
all student and University organiza-
tions will be briefed on requirements
and asked to aid in educating their
peers.

September 26 marks the date
Act 101 goes into effect and
Puskarich predicts Bucknell will be
operating a program which is “leaps
and bounds ahead” of other local
communities. While many commu-
nities, including Lewisburg, recycle
only four products, Bucknell’s pro-
gram is much more comprehensive.
“We are recycling seven products,
including leaf waste,” notes
Puskarich. She attributes the mag-
nitude of the operation of Bucknell’s
Grounds Supervisor, George Trutt.
“George said if we’re going to re-
cycle, we should do it right and re-
cycle all the materials. I agree with
him.”

Recycling plastics, glass, alu-
minum, newspaper, desk paper, cor-
Tugated cardboard, and leaf waste
constitutes an extremely complex
and costly operation, admits

Puskarich, but she also points to
present waste disposal costs. The
cost of dumping waste into the
Lycoming landfill, Bucknell’s
present method of disposal, has
tripled since 1988, and the life span
of the fill is diminishing rapidly.
According to figures presented by
the physical plant, the cost of
dumping in 1989 exceeded $70,000.
While the cost of recycling does
presently outweigh the money re-
ceived for materials, if Bucknell in-
creases the amount of recycled ma-
terial, recycling would pay for itself.
Puskarich points to the projected
decreased cost of dumping if more
materials are recycled in combina-
tion with the money received for
these materials as factors in balanc-
ing the cost and increasing effi-
ciency. These figures reveal, she
stresses, the importance of “every-
one doing their part” as an issue of
economic importance as well as of
environmental concern.

Bucknell’s program depends
not only on universal participation,
but continual update and education
as well. Puskarich notes that in a
university community there is a 25%
population turnover annually, which
necessitates ongoing programs to
effectively integrate incoming
freshmen into the program. The pro-
gram calls for “constant investiga-
tion into markets and requirements

of the state” as well as contact with
local governments and neighboring
colleges and universities.

While well on the way to fully
implementing one of the most com-
prehensive recycling programs in the
area, Puskarich emphasizes the pro-
gram is designed exclusively to
handle the waste generated by the
University. The borough of Lewis-
burg will have its own program, she
comments, and Bucknell is not pre-
pared to absorb the cost involved in
recycling materials for the local
communities.

Bush announces
return of troops

President Bush announced
Wednesday an immediate return of
American troops from the Persian
Gulf. He has pledged, also, to
maintain a forceful diplomatic pres-
ence in the Middle East in order to
resolve Arab-Israeli conflicts.

Bush emphasized the long-
standing American policy that Israel,
in order to attain peace and to secure
borders, must trade the territory it
seized in Arab-Israeli wars. Bush’s
statement may be read by Israel’s
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as an
attempt to force Israel concede ter-
ritory to the Palestinians.

Troops which had been sta-
tioned in the Persian Gulf will be
sent home, following the end of
fighting which came last week in the
Persian Gulf. Since then Iraqi Presi-
dent Saddam Hussein has consented
to give up his annexation of the small
emirate, and has agreed to pay back
all of Kuwait’s assets.

This action was taken on the
insistence of the United Nations, and
has seemingly resulted in a perma-
nent cease fire between Iraq and the
allied forces.

However, the freed Kuwait
City remains a scene of devastation;
the field which holds 684 out of
Kuwait’s 950 oil wells were set

An increasing number of indi-

have supported the movement to-

lobbying by the Kremlin to retain
their support.

population advocates independence
from the Sovict Union. Only a third
polled were actually of Latvian de-
scent. Russians and other non-
Latvians made up the balance of the
vote.

The Kremlin had anticipated
that advisory polls would indicate
support for independence by Latvian
and Estonian voters, but it has need
for concern over the unexpected re-
sults from Russian voters. The advi-
sory polls are a precursor to Presi-
dent Mikail Gorbachev’s national
referendum, scheduled for Mar. 17,
on preserving the union.

York expels six
for hazing

Six fraternity members at
York College face expulsion for
charges in hazing incidents. The
members of Kappa Psi Epsilon face
stiff disciplinary action for allegedly
forcing pledges to skin squirrels and
drink water from a toilet bowl.

One student will not be al-
lowed to return to school next se-
mester; five others face expulsion as
well. Joseph Merkle, dean of student
affairs, and the Greek Judicial
Board, comprised of students, de-
termined the punishment. In addition
to the expulsions, each fraternity
member will have to perform 10
hours of community service.

Fraternity members will ap-
peal the decision.

According to Merkle, state
law prohibits any activity which
might be degrading to an individual
or which affects his physical or
mental stamina.

Dan Walker, who has been
expelled from the college, said
pledge members were told to skin
squirrels for stew, drink toilet water,
drink alcohol, and eat hot peppers.

worked as a domestic surrogate for
the African National Congress in the
period during which it was banned.
But Feb. 2, 1990 marked the legal-

now fulfilled its role. “We feel that
the purpose for which we were set

FBI investigates
cyanide-lacing

Another wave of cyanide poi-
soning has left two people dead and
one seriously injured, and federal
officials warn people not to become
too complacent about possible tam-
pering of over-the-counter drugs. On
Tuesday, the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation took over the probing of
recent tampering cases.

In February, two people, both
from Washington, died after taking
Sudafed 12-hour decongestant cap-
sules which had been laced with
cyanide. One other is still recovering
from the poisoning, which also re-
sulted from cyanide-laced Sudafed
capsules.

The makers of Sudafed waited
to order a nationwide recall of the
drug until Sunday, when autopsy
reports, laboratory results, and in-
terviews provided enough evidence

not only about the problems of drug

Through the nearly 60

her son’s death. A deeply Christian

Congress, eager to avoid issues
dealing with the legal system, is un-
likely to solve the problem.

As part of the comprehensive
study of asbestos cases, federal
judges predicted that the number of
these cases will increase by 50 per-
cent within the next three years. For
each asbestos case tried or settled,
roughly two new cases are being
filed.

Deaths caused by asbestos,
rarely used today because of its
known harms to human beings, have
recently begun to surface. By the end
of the century, asbestos will have
caused as many as 200,000 deaths in
the United States, according to ex-

Senate looks at
nominee's past

Despite a continuing Senate
investigation of his financial past,
Lamar Alexander, nominated by
President George Bush to be secre-
tary of education, remains confident
that he will be confirmed for the
Cabinet position.

An article in Tuesday’s Wall
Street Journal said that Senate in-
vestigators are examining a series of
Alexander’s highly lucrative invest-
ments and prompted the nominee to
defend his financial past. “I’ve led an
interesting life, but I’m confident
that in the way I’ve conducted my
political life over the last 20 years,
I’ve only done what I should have
done,” said Alexander, president of
the University of Tennessee and
former governor of the state.

The article which spurred
Alexander’s statement indicated no
evidence of wrongdoing, but said
that his political standing attracted
business executives to include
Alexander in their investments.

Alexander said that he is will-
ing to publicly answer questions
about his financial investments.

Audition class assists aspiring actors

By David Murray
Staff Writer

They say ‘practice makes per-
fect,’ but in the world of professional
acting, practice makes money.
That’s because one four-minute au-
dition can make or break an actor’s
chances for performing with a com-
pany. But how does an actor learn
the art of the audition?

Until this semester, the only
answer was ‘trial and error.’ But
Bob Gainer, chair and associate
professor of theatre, has changed all
that. His new course on auditioning

was created expressly to teach stu-
dents bound for the stage how to play
the role of auditioner.

“Auditioning is the first thing
you do as a professional,” Gainer
says. “The judges—directors or
casting agents—want to see how you
handle stress and how you work with
a director.”

With a 98 per cent unemploy-
ment rate in their industry, actors
face a great deal of stress. For those
hoping to enroll in the Yale School
of Drama, for instance, each actor
must beat out thousands of other
candidates. Yale receives 2,500 ap-

The Collegiate Perspective
(and other fairy tales)

By Peter Lalos
Staff Writer

In a break from tradition (as-
suming there is any here as of yet),
and in response to numerous letters
of complaint from KISS (the
Kouncil of International Spelling
Supporters), this week’s “Colle-
giate Perspective” will concer it-
self with purely academic pursuits.
To wit, the following column has
devoted its space to an alphabetical
listing of university terminology in
which every college-age student
should be well-versed.

absence frenzy n. The cau-
tious state of euphoria which grips
a classroom of students when their
professor is not in attendance at
five after the hour.

awakeagony n. The mental
stress undergone by a bed-ridden
student as he/she waits for the final
five minutes to elapse before his/
her alarm sounds.

baitbrag v. To ask a friend
what he/she did over the past
weekend in order to foment a situ-
ation in which you can impress
him/her with what you did during
that same period of time.

botheretaliation n. The act
of repeatedly striking the wall,
ceiling or floor beside, above, or
below one’s room (resp.) in order
to inform a dormmate that the noise
emanating from his/her room has
reached an unacceptable level.

chronofixation n. During a
boring lecture, the affliction in-
volving students wherein they
check their watches every ten
minutes to see how much time is
left in that class period.

closet disconcertation n.
The embarrassment which results
from forgetting where you placed
your personal belongings in the
cafeteria coatrooms.

corneal evasion n. 1) Visual
tactic used toward professors by
students who have not adequately
prepared for the day’s lecture dis-
cussion, esp. when they do not de-
sire to be called upon to answer a

question. 2) Visual tactic utilized
by students who pass people on the
sidewalk who they have met but do
not know well enough to greet.

deluminoria n. The phe-
nomenon in which all of your hall
lights will invariably be turned off
when you wake up in the moming.

hollowvocalize v. To make
an entirely unprofound, trivial
contribution to a lecture discussion
simply because you feel that it is
again about time that you reminded
the professor that you are on the
class roster.

kleptavoyeurism n. The
sensation that a student receives
upon entering the bookstore that
he/she is being monitored as a po-
tential shoplifter; the feeling in-
creases exponentially as one gets
closer to the CD and cassette tape
section.

mailinger v. To stand in
front of one’s mailbox while read-
ing one’s mail, esp. when there is a
sizeable throng of students waiting
to be allowed access to their own
boxes.

monoconsumphobia n. The
fear of eating alone in the cafeteria.

new potatoes n. I’m still
working on this one.

placement amnesia n. The
phenomenon of forgetting where/if
one stored any personal belongings
in the cafeteria coatrooms.

salutation selection n. The
mental process by which John the
Bagman decides who to wish
“good luck” and who not to.

schizodiscover v. The act of
overhearing a hallmate talking to
him/herself in the toilet stall beside
you since he/she believes that he/
she is alone in the bathroom.

So impress your friends,
baffle your professors, and win
over that all-important date with
your newly expanded vocabulary
this spring! Besides, there will be a
quiz on this at the end of the se-
mester... I’ve been known to do
that. I mean it... you there, in the
back! Yeah, YOU! Don’t push me,
hairball!

plications each year and can accept
only 14 students.

Standing out in such a huge
field of competitors is where
Gainer’s course comes in. He helps
students understand that “It requires
such fortitude, will, and talent to be
an actor that they need to start facing
early the reality they are going to
confront in the worlds of theatre and
film.”

Most professional auditions
require an actor to perform two dra-
matic monologues—one in the clas-
sical style and one more contempo-
rary. Gainer says his class helps give
students “technical ways of estab-
lishing the reality of a monologue.”
Beyond that, students learn ways of
“dealing with the nature of the text”
and “techniques of presentation,”
according to Gainer. The course
also gives students an opportunity to
practice some other critical elements
of auditioning: characterization, im-
provisation, and imagination, among
others.

If you ever have insomnia at
4:45 a.m., think of Bertha Swartz,
because she is just arriving at work
in the cafeteria bake shop. More af-
fectionately known as “Bertha the
Baker,” she prepares all of the baked
goods served in the cafeteria and the
Bison.

The first task of her day is to
bake from scratch the donuts for that
morning’s breakfast. Donuts hot out
of the oven are one of the few items

Gainer himself, students in the class
perform for various area profession-
als. According to Gainer, he and two
students recently traveled to
Bloomsburg where “two members
of the Bloomsburg Theatre En-
semble company commented and
gave critical feedback” on the
Bucknellians’ audition perfor-
mances. Gainer believes such re-
views help answer the question
“How does the actor use his instru-
ment [himself] truthfully, expres-
sively, and effectively so it commu-
nicates optimally to the critical ob-
server?”

Andrew Garman ’91 and Tom
Quinn 91 are two of Gainer’s pupils
who aspire to be professional actors.
They assert that in an audition one
should be prepared for anything.

For example, a casting agent
once asked Garman during an audi-
tion to play Prince Hal from
Shakespeare’s Henry V as if he were
a baby. “They want to see if you can
take direction,” said Garman.

recipe calls for an amazing 25
pounds of chocolate chips and 24
pounds of butter per batch of cook-
ies. Bertha’s recipes won’t work on
a small scale, she says, so she
couldn’t reveal any of her secret for-

are limited. But there are certain
items which Bertha wouldn’t eat
anyway. For example, she com-
mented, “I hate the cheesecake and
the kids are getting tired of it too.”
Because Bertha is responsible
for baking for the whole campus, she
has to take into account the students’
tastes and appetites as well as her
own preferences. Although Hank
Ross, director of Dining Services,
plans the cafeteria menus, Bertha
manages to stay attuned to the stu-
dents’ tastes by keeping track of
which desserts are consistently left

Dean Dancers and
Musicians blend well

By Tina Henninger

The Weis Center was taken
by storm last Saturday as the Laura
Dean Dancers and Musicians took
the stage for an amazing evening
of live music and dance.

The evening’s success was
due to Laura Dean’s unique ap-
proach to the art of dance as she is
both the choreographer and com-
poser of her works. To emphasize
the importance of music to dance,
Dean has both the dancers and mu-
sicians perform simultaneously on
stage.

Dean does not believe in the
concept of soloists or principle
dancers, so no single dancer was
featured in her work. As a result of
this idea, the Laura Dean Dancers
created a sense of community,
which was evidenced in their
dancing.

Choreography was also used
to enhance the oneness of the

group; each dance was character-
ized by spinning movements, foot
patterns and distinctive arm and
hand gestures. When performed by
the dancers, this vocabulary of
movement created an intricate vi-
sual pattern for the audience. The
constant manipulation of the space
forced the viewer to focus on the
whole picture and not on a particu-
lar dancer.

A highlight of the company’s
visit to Bucknell was a modern
dance class offered to members of
the campus and Lewisburg com-
munity. Company dancer Anne
Wennerstrand taught the class and
successfully shared the style of the
Laura Dean Dancers with those in
attendance. According to Janelle
Oltorik, “she had a different tech-
nique that was interesting to learn,
and it was exciting to have such a
well-known company come to
Bucknell.”

Bison Chips entertain in St. Louis

By Joyce Dollinger

The Bison Chips, one of
Bucknell’s most popular singing
groups, left campus February 21 for
three days of singing and sight-see-
ing in St. Louis. They were invited
by Washington University, a fairly
large school with a significant A
Capella following, to perform three
standing-room-only concerts with
the Washington Pikers and

A highlight of the Bison Chips’ recent trip to St. Louis was posing for a picture with a bison statue at the
museum at the St. Louis Arch. Fortunately, a nearby security officer was able to track down an actual

petrified bison chip to complete the photo. Pictured left to right are: Tim Anderson ’94, Craig Bitter ’93,

Unfortunately, the trip seemed
doomed from the start. Only nine of
the eleven Chips were able to make
the journey because of illness, and
almost all who did go were also sick,
but they were a success nevertheless,
receiving a standing ovation from a
crowd of over seven hundred their

final night.

The song that managed to “al-
ways bring the house down” was
Madonna’s “Like A Virgin,” a song
sung at Chip Fest last year and as
stated by Chip Craig Bitter, no
longer to be performed on campus
because it is “too embarrassing.”
This act includes soloist Andrew
Lunstad strutting down the stage in a
lovely dress, much to the admiration
of the other Chips who are bedecked

with sunglasses and beaded neck-
laces. Humorously, the founder of
the Washington Pikers threw change
at the Bison Chips during the first
performance of this song, leading
members of the audience to throw
money the following night.

In addition to performing, the
trip gave the Chips the opportunity
to visit the sights of St. Louis.
Highlights included visits to the
Anheuser-Busch Brewery and the
St. Louis Arch, at the top of which
they performed “Only You” with the
group from Duke.

The Chips always enjoy
working with other groups because,
according to Chip Pete West, “A
Capella people usually seem to
mesh well with other A Capella
groups.” The fact that they had more
free time to get to know the other
singers made this trip even better
than previous ones.

Fortunately, an opportunity
that they thought would be a night-
mare tumed out well. As Pete West
said, “It was a moral victory for us.
We were able to work hard, puil to-
gether, and everything really came
out well. It was a big accomplish-
ment.”

Though the Chips did not
travel in the fall, this was their sec-
ond trip this semester after Comell
University on February 15. They
have received many invitations fiom

Concordia to liven up Weis with
a concert that is far from typical

Classics and new works to be performed with Broadway star

By Laura Grisin
Staff Writer

The Concordia Symphony
will perform their unique blend of
jazz and American classics under the
direction of Marin Alsop, the first
female recipient of the Koussevitsky
Conducting Prize, 8 p.m. tomorrow
in the Weis Center. The performance
will feature Tony Award-winning
singer and actress Judy Kaye who
most recently sang the role of
Carlotta in the Broadway production
of The Phantom of the Opera.

“The program, which includes
works by Aaron Copland and
George Gershwin, promises an op-
portunity to see two very talented
artists in an evening of light music
and orchestral jazz,” said William
Boswell, director of cultural events.
“It’s especially appropriate that
works by Copland are being per-
formed, since this hero of American
music passed away just a few
months ago. And it’s a chance to
break preconceptions that an or-
chestra must be conducted by a

man.

The Concordia Symphony (pictured above) will present American classics by Aaron Copland and George
Gershwin as well as a very recent work by Robert Christianson tomorrow night at the Weis Center.

Judy Kaye (pictured below), who recently won a Tony Award for her role in Broadway’s Phantom of the
Opera, will be featured with the orchestra.

The Koussevitsky Conducting
Prize is an honor that Alsop shares
with the legendary Leonard
Bernstein. She explained that at the
age of 11 or 12, she knew that she
wanted to be a conductor, but con-
ducting was not an activity for a
young girl to seriously pursue. She
said, however, that the situation for
women has changed a lot since then,
especially in the last 5 years. She
stated, “Ten years ago, what I’ve
done wouldn’t have been possible.”

What she has accomplished is
significant. A graduate of Yale Uni-
versity and the Julliard School, she
serves as music director of the Long
Island Philharmonic and the Eugene
Symphony Orchestra in Oregon.
Last year she participated in the First
Pacific Music Festival in Japan with
Leonard Bernstein and Michael
Tilson Thomas. In May she became
the first woman to conduct the Bos-
ton Pops Orchestra in its 107 year
history.

Alsop created Concordia in
1984 to eliminate the barriers that
audiences have placed between jazz
and classical music. She spoke of the
misconception that “classical is stiff
and jazz is hip.” With her orchestra,
however, she has succeeded in mak-
ing “people looser about listening to
classical music.”

You can get the facts.

For information call The Pennsylvania Department of Health,
Office of Communications (717) 787-1783.

Concordia presents a classical
repertoire along with new American
jazz and 20th century works. The
orchestra has, in fact, premiered
more than 20 new American works
under Alsop’s leadership. Saturday's
program will include Copland’s
“Music for the Theatre” and George
Gershwin’s Overture to “Oh, Kay!”
Rounding out the performance will
be Robert Christianson’s “Tone
Poem for a New Age” which com-
bines the elements of popular and
classical music. Christianson’s ex-
perience includes arranging for and
performing with Aretha Franklin,
Diana Ross, and Chaka Khan.

The second half of the concert
will feature Broadway singer Judy
Kaye who will sing a group of
American folk songs arranged by
Copland, as well as three Gershwin
pieces accompanied by their original
orchestrations including “Embrace-
able You” and “I Got Rhythm.”

Tickets for Concordia ($10
with a Bucknell I.D.) are still avail-
able at the Weis Center Box Office
and at the door.

The Silence of the Lambs
thrills and chills viewers
New suspense film is a must-see

By Vic Tchiprout
and Laura Grisin
Staff Writer

Certain to be one of the
year’s best thrillers, The Silence of
the Lambs is an intense and chill-
ing film that is not to be missed.

Lambs stars Jodie Foster as
Clarice Starling, a FBI trainee who
is assigned to gather information

on psychotic serial killer Buffalo
Bill who has taken to skinning his
victims. It is the childhood memory
of her father’s murder as well as the
slaughtering and “screaming of the
lambs” at her uncle’s sheep ranch
that drives her in her quest for jus-
tice. Through a series of tense dis-
cussions with Hannibal “the Can-
nibal” Lecter, an imprisoned psy-

chiatrist played by Anthony
Hopkins, Clarice learns to think
like a killer. Clarice's attempt to
"silence the lambs" makes for
enough spine-tingling suspense to
keep you out of both elevators and
basements like Psycho kept you
out of showers.

The audience was on the
edge of their seats, especially dur-
ing the scenes in which Clarice

speaks with Dr. Lecter through the
glass wall of his cell. With echoes
of the guard's warning, "Don't get
close to the glass!" resounding
through one's head, one could only
imagine the consequences if she
did. And what could happen to
anyone who got too close to
Lecter? Perhaps you should see
this film for yourself.

Musicians and artists are
invited to Naked Lunch

By Jim Seibert

The Naked Lunch open read-
ing series, named for the disrobing
of the soul that takes place when one
reads one’s own poetry to an audi-
ence, had this semester’s first meet-
ing on Wednesday. Naked Lunch
meets every Wednesday at noon in
the Langone Center Cave giving
Bucknellians the opportunity to
share their creativity.

Since the birth of Naked
Lunch three years ago, people have
yet to show up naked. A change this
semester, however, is an expansion
in the artistic genre. The walls of the

Cave will now be available for stu-
dents to hang paintings, sketches and
photographs, and the microphone
will be open to musicians as well as
readers of poetry and fiction.

Stephanie Prial, who spear-
headed Naked Lunch’s public rela-
tions campaign, believes that cre-
ative students need a reliable outlet
for their work. Virtually all forms of
artistic expression are welcome.

This Wednesday, why not join
fellow students and faculty members
for Naked Lunch? Whether as a
participant or an observer, it is sure
to be enjoyable.

It’s time for a resignation

Or will Howard force Bucknell to drag this out?

Four Bucknell women are still missing this week after being left stranded in Worcester, Massachusetts by
their basketball coach, Lori Howard. The four were last seen hitch-hiking on 1-84. The parents of the four have filed

a six-million-dollar class-action lawsuit against Bucknell University for negligence.

Fortunately, this case is a fictitious one, but the possibility became very real last Saturday. Not only did it have
the potential to become a tragedy, but it could have posed a liability nightmare for the University. In fact, it still
might.

Coach Howard exercised poor judgement when she refused transportation back from the Patriot League tour-
nament to four players who had been caught drinking the night before. It is an understood policy that the coach is
responsible for the safety of the athletes from the time they leave Bucknell until the time they return. It was uncon-
scionable to put these four women and the University at risk.

Although Howard had confirmation that one of the player’s parents would provide the four a ride back to
Bucknell, leaving them alone still put them at risk and placed the University in a liability predicament. Furthermore,
the infringement upon the free time of the parents raises further questions of misconduct and liability. Does Howard
expect the University to foot the bill for her mistake?

While it is true that individual coaches determine their own alcohol policies, the disciplinary action taken by
Howard was reprehensible. The welfare of the athletes should always be foremost in the coach’s mind; Howard’s
bad judgement may have resulted from any number of frustrations, including her team’s 2-24 season, but that

cannot excuse her actions.

The athletes may have been in violation of the team’s policy prohibiting drinking during the season. This
infraction should have entailed an appropriate reprimand when the team returned to Bucknell; they should not have
been made to walk the plank.

The hard feelings between the women’s basketball players and their head coach are apparent. Howard has lost
the respect of many team members and many of her colleagues in the athletic department. Her continued presence
at Bucknell will only serve to salt already open wounds; hence, she would be doing both herself and the University
a favor by tendering her immediate resignation.

If she will not resign, Athletic Director Rick Hartzell will be forced to conduct a lengthy and in-depth review
of her actions which will not only place a tremendous emotional burden on the team members, but probably reflect
poorly on Howard as well. In any case, the University would be putting itself in jeopardy once again if it were to

renew Howard’s contract.

Will Howard bow out gracefully? She exercised poor judgement once; can we count on her to make the right

decision now?

LETTERS

Reader disturbed by
writer’s prison review

To the Editor: like heterosexuality, an expression

of human love or desire.

I was also concerned that
Lalos immediately moved from
homosexuality to AIDS, as if ho-
mosexuality were the cause of all
the AIDS related deaths in the
prison. First of all, let’s step back
and remember that homosexuality
is never the cause of AIDS. Unsafe
sex is, but not homosexuality.
Also, Lalos doesn’t mention the
sharing of needles in I.V. drug use,
which, like unsafe sex, is a high
risk behavior which can spread the
AIDS-virus. It’s also important to
remember that some people may
have come into the prison already
HIV positive, perhaps from I.V.
drug use, or unsafe sex with male
andlor female partners.

From the way Peter describes
the situation in that one paragraph,
it’s as if homosexuality is a “hard-
ship” that must be endured by pris-
oners. Furthermore, it seems as if
he’s saying homosexuality causes
AIDS and leads to the “common
occurrence” of death as “‘an ex-
pected fact of life.”

My guess is that Peter did not
mean to put down homosexuality
or to say that gay people cause
AIDS and death, but that is how
this particular paragraph comes out.
It is the assumptions behind the
paragraph that concern me. I’m
much more worried about the un-
conscious ways in which we dimin-
ish or disenfranchise people than I
am concerned about easily recog-
nizable, blatant homophobic at-

tacks. Some of you probably
read that paragraph and thought
nothing of it. And while you
were reading it you probably
weren’t thinking “homosexual-
ity is an affliction” or “gay men
cause AIDS.”

But both of those mes-
sages are implicit in the para-
graph and you may easily have
taken those messages in without
questioning their negative im-
plications. This is how stereo-
types and myths get perpetu-
ated. No one challenges those
assumptions, and pretty soon
you’re constantly connecting
gay men, AIDS, and death in
such a way that gay
men=AIDS=death. This is very
dangerous, precisely because it
happens on such an uncon-
scious level.

It’s also sometimes very
difficult to see what our own
assumptions are, especially if
we're part of a mainstream
group. If the way we see things
is supported by the world
around us, then it’s easy to
confuse assumptions for reality.
I write this letter to point out
how easy it is to link negative
images to non-dominant
groups, especially in a culture
like ours where “different” is
often seen as “deficient” or
negatively “deviant.”

In the Feb 15th issue of
The Bucknellian, Peter Lalos
reviewed the HBO special on
the Lewisburg penitentiary.
Among his comments were the
following remarks: “Another
inmate...demonstrated the ten-
dency of many prisoners to
gradually accept the countless
hardships and loss of basic
liberties. He calmly described
the widespread homosexuality
amongst the inmate ranks.
Despite the distribution of
condoms in the facility, AIDS-
related deaths in the prisoner
population are an almost com-
mon occurrence, an expected
fact of life.”

I was disturbed by Lalos’
intimation that homosexuality
in prison is an example of the
“countless hardships and loss
of basic liberties” that inmates
come to “gradually accept.”
Certainly one of the horrors of
prison is homosexual rape. But
it is important to make the
distinction between rape and
homosexuality. All homo-
sexual relationships in prison
are not rape, and homosexuality
itself is certainly not a “hard-
ship” or a “loss of basic liber-
ties.” Homophobia is a hard-
ship endured by homosexuals,
and homophobic reaction to
homosexuality can result in
“loss of basic liberties.” But
homosexuality itself is simply,

Cartoon draws criticism

To the Editor:

In the March 1, 1991 issue of
The Bucknellian, a cartoon by
Corey Zayatz appeared on the
Opinions page, called “how our
school got its name.” This drawing
of a man with his pants down hand-
ing a “buck” to a prostitute named
“Nell,” was offensive and disturb-
ing to me.

What is particularly ironic
about this illustration is that it ap-
peared directly above a letter from
President Sojka which condemned
sexual assault on campus and urged
the community to become more
aware of this issue. Sexual assault,
prostitution, and sexist humor are
not unrelated. Treating women as
objects, using their bodies as com-
modities, is part of a continuum of
sexism that has rape and violence
against women at its extreme. They

_ have learned through early indoctri-

nation that their sexuality is not
their won and that others can con-
trol the use of their bodies.

It’s important to women on
this campus and across the country
that educational efforts to reduce
sexism be taken seriously. When
items such as this appear in a main-
stream medium for news, it demon-
strates a lack of understanding and
respect women. Some will say “It’s
humor, can’t you take a joke?” The
problem is that sexism disguised as
humor is not funny to its victims.
Accepting such jokes contributes to
an attitude that makes discrimina-
tion and objectification of women
more acceptable.

Plantation owners trivialized
and made fun of their black slaves
and got away with treating them
like property. Nazi forces humili-
ated Jews as well as gay men and
lesbians in Germany and laughed at
their suffering. The problem is that
just as these oppressors did not stop

at making jests and using
disempowered groups as the butt of
their humor, some men do not stop
with ridiculing women. The sys-
tematic dehumanization of blacks,
Jews, gays, lesbians, and women
includes torture and brutality,
sexual assault and murder. Atti-
tudes affect behavior. Views that
promote the idea that women are
objects for men’s pleasure or com-
modities to be bought, that their
intellect and emotions do not count,
and that their position, worth, and
appearance can be trivialized, are
all links in the chain of oppression
that keep men and women from
being equal.

I am not suggesting that last
week’s cartoon be censored. I sup-
port Zayatz’s right to freedom of
expression. I am, in turn, exercising
my right to express my disappoint-
ment and concern. What he and

To the Editor:

Every week The Bucknellian
manages to offend me with at least
one sexist article, photo, or cartoon.
I have put up with photographs of
subservient sorority women shining
men’s shoes [Feb. 22, p. 11]. I
have tried to ignore the countless
articles that refer to women as mere
sex objects (“I grabbed myself this
slam-hound from Australia with
really firm...Kangaroos, and she
took me to her room and TOSSED
MY BOOMERANG!!!” [Feb. 15,
p. 11]). But I cannot let the cartoon
from last week slide. For those of
you who did not see it, there was an
illustration of a prostitute named
Nell being paid a dollar for her
“services.” The caption reads,
“How Our School Got Its Name.” I
am outraged that the editors some-
how thought that this cartoon was

motive of Features

To the editor:

Since a colon usually indi-
cates a form af address, I am
curious to know if Sue Basalla
spoke to any Greek women be-
fore attributing an outdated Vir-
ginia Slims advertising slogan to
Bucknell’s sororities [February
22, 1991).

“We've come a long way,
Baby,” followed by a photograph
from 1914 and one as recent as
the 1950’s, seems a rather idiotic

attempt to describe the evolution
of Greek roles at Bucknell.

Ms. Basalla obviously
holds some convictions with
regard to the Greek system, some
of which may indeed be justified.
However, her shoddy journalistic
effort renders any such opinions
impotent, as well as making the
quality of the Bucknellian’s fea-
ture section laughable.

What is the value of an honor
code? Why is it important that
Bucknell should have an honor
code? Why is it that so many top
schools in the country have honor
codes? Since I went to a high school
that had an honor code, I know its
values and have come to wonder
why Bucknell does not have one.

The value and importance of
an honor code is simple. It lets one
grow to understand the value of be-
ing a responsible, moral person. It
teaches each individual the reasons,
the value, and the importance of
living life this way. By having rules
imposed upon individuals, one does
not see or learn why rules are in
place. They are just seen as barriers
and restrictions that signify a lack of
trust. An honor code lets an indi-
vidual reflect on the fact that his ac-
tions are his responsibility. Without
an honor code or without people be-
ing honorable on their own, this im-
portant value is neglected and people
will leave Bucknell and enter the
world without fully understanding
the meaning of personal integrity
and true responsibility.

The reasons Bucknell should
have and needs an honor code are
very obvious. One simple reason is
the problem of low morale. This is
partly due to social restrictions

“Yes. The interests of students
are not really represented in the
university’s decisions. If they
were, the university would allow
competition and provide better
quality goods and services at
lower prices. However, as it
stands now, the university is
gouging the students for all they
can bear. Why can I get milk at
Weis for $.53 and at the Bison
for $.75?”

which demeaned students by sym-
bolizing a lack of trust by our ad-
ministration. Once regulations be-
came more student-run, morale
picked up and students began to
show their ability to be responsible
for themselves and peers in social
activity. The more responsibility we
are given, the better students will
feel about themselves and Bucknell.
An honor code does not just encom-
pass academia, it entails all aspects
of student life. It means being an
honorable responsible person in all
Situations, academic and social.
College should be a time to learn to
make the right decisions for the right
reasons, individually. As one learns
to make these decisions for himself,
he learns to be an individual. Buck-
nell can increase morale and teach
students to be individuals through an
honor code.

Faculty also should support an
honor code. They are at Bucknell to
teach and educate as experts in their
fields. They are not here to babysit
and monitor students. The teaching
is up to the faculty and the learning
is up to the students. Let professors
do what they are educators for, to
teach us. Let them not enforce rules
and regulations but represent and
show students the higher ideals rep-
resented in an honor code. This does
not mean naivete by faculty but sets
up an understanding between stu-

nasium floor above.

I spent hours scratching my
whisker-less chin and wondering
why assaulting 12 year olds with
dirty jock-straps made Moss and
Mite so gleeful. They would grunt,
high five, and jump up and down so
you could hear their brains rattling
around in their head like a tic-tac in
a tuna can. Why?

Last night I saw “Tango And
Cash” and now I finally understand.

“Tango And Cash” is a
“buddy cop” movie starring
Sylvester ‘yo Adrienne’ Stallone and
Kurt Russell. The novel plot
premise in this movie is that at first,
the steroid swallowing Stanislavskys
don’t really like each other. How-
ever, after smashing some wimpy
thugs, torturing an evil mastermind
with a menacing foreign accent, and
taking a shower together while ad-
miring each other’s private parts, the
two become jubilant comrades.
Note the heart-warming rapport be-
tween the two pals in this climatic
scene where they prepare to confront
the evil mastermind with the foreign
accent and drop a grenade down his
pants.

Kurt: Hey Dude, lets go kick
some ass!

it, broke a rule, and didn’t get
caught. Whether they know itor not,
they do not see that they have
cheated themselves of knowledge,
acted irresponsibly, and were dis-
honest to themselves as well as their
peers. The individual is too con-
cerned with breaking the “rule” to
truly understand what they have
done or eventually, to learn from it.
If students cannot act responsibly
without being watched over after
graduation, then perhaps they
haven’t received the best education.

It has been stated that a person
who cheats on tests will see no rea-
son to stop in the future. He will
grow to more corrupt actions in the
future. Without realizing the immo-
rality of being dishonest, what would
stop this person from accepting
bribes or embezzling funds in the
future? Teach the value of morality
now and let students see why they
should not cheat in life and prevent
future corruption in the future. This
should be part of an individual’s
growth through education. The less
a school needs to regulate its stu-
dents because students are capable
of making the right decisions on
their own, the better the school and
the better the education.

My high school had an honor
code and I truly did not see its value
and importance until after gradua-
tion when I realized how it influ-
enced my growth as an individual
and shaped my high school experi-
ence. This code was presented in the
beginning of each academic year and
was on a plaque for everyone enter-
ing the school to see. The idea of the
code was to make each individual
the best person he could be by real-
izing his goals, desires, faults, and
strengths individually. It gave a base
for each student to create his own
personal honor code which would
shape our morals and future actions.

Bucknell should have an

HOW ’BOUT THAT

mn

honor code because the quality of
faculty and students at this school
deserve the responsibility. If a true
education is going to be served, each
student should leave Bucknell with
at least a basis, or set of morals, to
guide him in his decisions and ac-
tions. If Bucknell wants this kind of
student, it must first trust that this
kind of student can exist. Bucknell
needs a code of conduct and set of
principles that can guide us in mak-
ing the right decisions instead of
telling us. This University should
stand as a role model for the indi-
viduals that it educates and for the
providers of this education. When I
went to high school, I felt special and
full of pride because I knew I was
trusted. This trust and responsibility
made me realize the importance of
everything I did because I had a
standard to live up to. Because it
was my responsibility, my actions
not only shaped the way I was per-
ceived by my peers but shaped the
way I felt about myself. When I did
what was right it made me feel good
because I was living up to the stan-
dards I had accepted by attending my
school and being part of that com-
munity. No one is perfect and I do
break these rules occasionally but in
the end I always grow a little bit
more because I develop a deeper un-

Do you think that the Bison and bookstore unfairly
raise their prices because they have no competition?

Glenda D’urso
Bison employee

“No I do not. They went to local

stores and did a survey of prices in
surrounding areas—and the prices
at the Bison are not out of sight. I
do not know about the bookstore.”

Craig Bitter ’92
English

“T wouldn’t say that it’s because of
unfair competition. It’s more the
fact that they get away with charg-
ing higher prices—simply because
our parents are paying for it. The
prices they charge are simply un-
fair. The school shouldn’t be mak-
ing an excessive profit unfairly
simply because we have no other
place to buy food and supplies.”

Gary Sojka
University President

“T’m not involved with pricing but I
do know that they survey the local
merchants to check prices. Because
they serve as a convenience to the
students and do not wish to undercut
the local merchants they are not
likely to run the lowest price. But,
they do not specifically set out to
raise prices for students.”

Andrea Sauchelli 93

“Yes. They know these are the
only places we have to shop and
buy food and they take advantage
of us.”

Speaking on behalf of the dead Iraqi soldiers

By Charles Sackrey

What good am I
If I can’t hear you cry?
(Bob Dylan)

Last night, in a local restaurant, I
overheard the conversation among six men
at a nearby table. “The fifty calibers must
have gone right through the tanks,” one of
them said. “The napalm sure slowed them
down,” another said. The laughter around
the table. “Yeah,” another said, “On televi-
sion, there’s a truck load of about 25 Iraqi
soldiers, and then there’s a big poof, then all
of the sudden no more Iraqi soldiers.” Table-
wide laughter. Then more admiring chatter
about the weaponry.

That conversation reminded me of a
recent exchange in the foyer of the Univer-
sity, when some of us in S.T.O.P. staged a
“sit-in” to bring attention to our view of the
war. As students from classes poured
through the doors, one of our group said to
them as they passed, “No more bombing.”
Mostly, she was ignored, but not by two
male students, one of whom stomped his
boot on a peace sign of the floor, while the
other muttered “Let’s kill them all.”

Over the past six weeks there have
been thousands, maybe millions, of these

kinds of comments, at Bucknell, downtown
in Lewisburg, over the television, every-
where. One colonel, a flyer, compared a
convoy of Iraqis, caught in the open by
night-vision radar, to “a bunch of big-city
cockroaches, who came out at night, and so
we killed them.” All these comments and
reports depict the Iraqi soldiers as sub-hu-
man creatures, not worthy of dignity, and
thus not worthy of life. The truth is undeni-
able that some Iraqi soldiers raped and pil-
laged and tortured Kuwaitis. How many did
that? No one will ever really know, except
the simple logistics of an army of half a
million men spread across a vast desert has
to mean that pillaging Iraqi soldiers were a
distinct minority.

What I have read tells me the great

- majority of the Iraqi army was drafted into

service, in one way or another, death or im-
prisonment if they refused. Apparently,
about one third of all Iraqi males from the
ages of 15-39 were in the military at the be-
ginning of the war. And what must be true
about these men is that they shared the most
fundamental aspects of being human with
their American and Allied counterparts.
For example, these Iraqi conscripts
have mothers and fathers, perhaps a hundred
thousand of whom—perhaps it’s two hun-
dred thousand of whom—now must wail

into the night that their sons have been killed
in action; that their sons are missing in ac-
tion; that their sons have been burned alive
by napalm, fried to death inside a tank; that
their sons are inside an American prison
camp; that their sons might have lost eyes,
legs, arms, skulls, teeth. Maybe 35,000 of
these sons. Maybe 100,000. Who knows?

The children of these Iraqi conscripts,
and their brothers and sisters and cousins and
nieces and nephews might also this moment
be lying in their beds, gaunt eyes looking at
the ceiling, squelching tears, shedding tears,
worrying about whether their fathers, or
brothers, or cousins, might have been burned
inside a bunker, blownapart by the fire from
a helicopter, vaporized while riding the top
of a truck that was trying to flee a murderous
battlefield.

These Iraqi soldiers must also have
had sweethearts back home. Outside of
Kuwait City, as thousands fled north to es-
cape a losing cause, intrucks, tanks, old cars,
they ran into the horrificconsequences of an
order from George Bush, or one of his sol-
diers, to destroy themcompletely. Bodies,
strewn on seven miles of highway, were
found dismembered and burned, and along
side some of them were what the papers
called “booty,” jewelry, women’s clothes.
The newspapers seemed to imply that the

soldiers had looted Kuwait City, and while
taking their plunder home were caught like
rats in the open desert, the booty all the more
evidence they should be destroyed. I found
myself wondering if some of this jewelry
might have been presents for sweethearts.
Maybe not, whatever these fleeing soldiers
did, it must have been true that their bodies
on the ground were not too long ago on some
Iraqi city, clean shaven, swaggering about
the streets in their finest clothes, trying to
attract someone they thought beautiful.

In these days of mandatory patriotism,
can we find room inside ourselves to have a
bit of pity for these Iraqi soldiers? Isn’t it
true that most of them were victimized by
Saddam Hussein’s megalomania? And isn’t

it true that when George Bush decided to
teach Saddam Hussein a lesson, he also de-
cided to have tens of thousands of these Iraqi
soldiers killed? And, if we can’t find it in
our souls to have pity for these Iraqi soldiers,
can we pause for a moment of pity for their
parents, their children, or cousins, or neph-
ews, or for their sweethearts?

And, whether we can or cannot feel
that pity, can we stop to think what it means
that last week we Americans were, in a great
majority, urging the president to teach
Saddam Hussein ever harsher lessons, which
meant of course, more Iraqi soldiers lying
dead in the sand, more mothers, fathers,
children, brothers, sisters, cousins, sweet-
hearts, wailing into the dark Iraqi night?

we might apply this shallow hatred to play-
ers on a football team, or a lawyer, or a slow
driver on the highway. We mutate people
into two-dimensional, black and white
scapegoats as we assert our glossy full-color
strength.

We also learn to see women as prizes,
that can be won if the man smashes enough
dehumanized bad guys and impresses them
with his power. Or as faithful Saint Beards
that placidly supply the men with beers after
they’ve finished blowing up commies with
rocket launchers. Sometimes women are
depicted as property that is stolen from the
“good guy” until he comes to retrieve it ina
fit of hormonal rage.

Perhaps, we eventually realize that
there is more to life than smashing and
bashing. We understand that we shouldn’t
mindlessly idolize or worship another hu-
man being, just because he wields power and
manages to identify a “bad guy” that can be
overcome.

Now that adolescence is over and the
scent of the “MEN ONLY” sign is mal-
odorous memory, we have finally learned to
evaluate all aspects of an individual before
euphorically deeming him/her a “hero.”

is something “good” to live up to and be
proud of as one moves through life’s expe-

end like arule but acts as a guide that sets up
principles that can always be called upon,
and that will always lead to growth and a
deeper understanding of oneself and the so-
ciety we live in. If we are at Bucknell to be
educated, than we are here to grow, and this
is what an honor code is truly for.

the need to protest the oppression of

Hard work, focus pay off for Marchetti

Bison All-American pushes to become Bucknell’s first-ever national champion wrestler

By Mitch Benton
Staff Writer

It would be easy for Tom
Marchetti ’91 to relax and enjoy the
conclusion of his senior year in col-
lege. He has already achieved more
then anyone could have expected
upon his entering Bucknell.

Marchetti has been an All-
American, a three-time conference
champion and this school’s all-time
wrestling statistical leader, but that
doesn’t appear to satisfy this com-
petitor. One of the most accom-
plished wrestlers in Bucknell his-
tory, he’s pushing himself to become
Bucknell’s first ever national cham-
pion.

nos eee
Bucknellian File Photo
Tom Marchetti 91 receives East
Coast Conference championship
trophy last year in Davis Gym.

Head Wrestling Coach Bob
Ferraro knew he had recruited a spe-
cial athlete in Tom Marchetti when
the Easton Area High School student
signed to attend Bucknell. Wrestling
as a 145-pounder in high school, the

National Honor Society member
compiled a career record of 79-16-1,
as a three-time letter winner. Coach
Ferraro believed that even his nu-
merous individual honors, including
twice being a district runner-up, a
regional champion and, in 1987, the
145-pound Pennsylvania Interscho-
lastic Athletic Association state
runner-up, did not do the wrestler’s
talents justice.

“T believe that Pennsylvania
wrestling is the best in the nation and
to be the state runner-up to a two-
time champion (Scott Hovan, now
nationally ranked fifth for the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh), showed
Tom’s abilities. But Tom had just
beaten Hovan two weeks earlier and
was injured going into the finals.
Just to make it that far with bruised
ribs is quite an accomplishment.”

At the top of Marchetti’s list
of goals when arriving at Bucknell
was becoming an All-American. To
accomplish this, he would have to
finish the season as one of the top
eight wrestlers in the nation, and his
freshman season left no doubt that
this was attainable.

Hardly missing a beat in
making the transition to college
wrestling, as well as a new weight
(167 Ibs.), Marchetti posted the sec-
ond best freshman record in school
history, 21-7, including six victories
by pin. His performance led the
Amateur Wrestling News, America’s
authority on college wrestling, to
name him to the 1988 Freshman All-
America Squad.

Despite this rookie season
recognition, few envisioned what
Marchetti was to accomplish the
following year. He completed a
successful regular season campaign
before sweeping through the East
CoastConference Championships to
earn his first individual conference
title. All of Bucknell’s five champi-

ons earned berths at the NCAA
Championships and it was there, in
Oklahoma City, that Marchetti sur-
prised the wrestling establishment.
Unseeded, he won all three of his
matches in the preliminary rounds,
two by pin, to reach the
quarterfinals. Once there, Marchetti
topped James Madison’s Rob
Milavsky, securing his status as the
first Bucknell wrestler to be an All-
American. He finished the compe-
tition in fourth place, the only
sophomore and unseeded wrestler to
reach that high in the final standings.

According to Marchetti, this
success was the worst that could
have happened to his career. “My
goal coming to Bucknell was to be
an All-American. I did that too early
and I lost sight of the path during my
junior year.”

While he may have been dis-
appointed with his performance in
1990, he hardly put up disappoint-
ing statistics. Ranked most of the
season as the number two 167-
pounder in the nation, behind Dan
St. John of Arizona State, Marchetti
finished the year tied with Ed Curran
’88 for the most victories (29) in a
season by a Bucknell wrestler. He
closed the season with his second
consecutive conference champion-
ship, winning the coaches award for
being the outstanding wrestler in the
tournament, before falling one vic-
tory shy of repeating as an All-
American.

As impressive as his three
other seasons have been, Marchetti’s
senior year could turn out to be his
most outstanding. Throughout
1990-91, the Bison co-captain has
set school records for victories in a
season (31) and a career (106), as
well as pins in a season (18) and a
career (40Y."He and 190-pound fel-
low co-captain Bryan Burns ’91 be-
came the third and fourth Bucknell

wrestlers of all-time to win three
consecutive conference crowns, and
Marchetti is currently ranked eighth
in the nation.

It appears as though finishing
with that status would not satisfy the
senior. His lone goal heading to the
NCAA’s in Iowa City is not just to
repeat as an All-American, but rather
to win Bucknell’s first ever national
championship.

“Shoot for the stars and you'll
land on the moon,” he recites, “I feel
that it’s within my reach. I’ve lost to
the top seed (Mark Reiland of Iowa)
by just two points and to the sixth
(G.T. Taylor of Arizona State) in
overtime.”

As excited and prepared as
Marchetti is for the challenge, he
does not seem concemed about the
impending end of his college career.

Ahrens and Co. lead Bison
sluggers over VMI, Radford

By Jon Terry

The 1991 Bucknell base-
ball squad left the state of Virginia
last weekend with a successful 2-1
road trip.

Last Friday, the Bison erased
a 7-1 deficit in Lexington to defeat
the Virginia Military Institute 12-8.
The key to Bucknell’s first win of the
year was the longball. Four Bison—
Roger Ahrens ‘91, Mark Kennedy
‘92, Dave Koerner ‘92, and Jim
Zervanos ‘92—hit home runs in a
game that was called due to darkness
after eight innings. Dan Krewson
‘91 picked up the win in relief.

The following day Buck-
nell split a doubleheader at Radford.
In game one, the Bison were stymied
by Radford lefty Chris Connolly,
who allowed just four singles in his
seven inning complete game, win-
ning 9-1.

In game two, however, the
Bison bats awakened once again,
turning a 7-3 deficit into a 9-8 win.
Mike Kearns ‘93 (3 for 3, 2-run HR),
Larry Trout ‘93 (2 for 4, HR, 2 RBI),
and Ahrens (2 for 4, HR, 3 RBI) led
the attack, while Jim Stevens ‘94
pitched two innings of solid relief for
the win.

The outlook for the 1991
season is a bit hazy at this moment.
Nine players have been lost from last
year’s 13-20 team due to graduation.
Among them is shortstop Joe
Markulike, who set 17 Bucknell in-
dividual offensive records last year.
He played professionally for the
Idaho Falls Braves in the Pioneer
League this past summer.

This leaves the Bison ex-
tremely young, with only two se-
niors in the starting lineup—first
baseman Ted Obligado and out-
fielder Roger Ahrens. Co-captain
Kennedy, leadoff hitter Kearns, out-
fielder Steve Gyimesi ‘93, as well as
the two seniors appear ready to lead
what should be a potent hitting at-

tack.

The missing link at this
point is Coach Gene Depew’s
pitching staff, which appears ques-
tionable. Last year’s leading
hurler, Kurt Waldener ‘93, is out
indefinately with shoulder prob-
lems. Two other sophomores,
Denis Maguire and Jack
Kazanjian, along with senior Mike

Rizzi, make up the current starting
rotation,

So far this year, Bison starters
are averaging just three innings per
outing, and the team ERA is a as-
tronomical 6.14. Krewson (5 IP, 3
hits, 8 strikeouts) appears ready to
either lead the bullpen or be pro-
moted to starter. While this year’s
staff shows potential, they will have

to improve in order to make the solid
offense hold up.

The Bison open up their
home schedule tomorrow with a
doubleheader against Franklin and
Marshall. Fifteen of Bucknell’s next
seventeen games are at home, in
this, the team's inaugural season in
the Patriot League.

Co-Captain Roger Ahrens ’91, seen here in action last fall, broke the Bucknell all-time career home run
and RBI records this weekend. He hit his 16th home run while collecting his 96th RBI.

the trip to Iowa, the 21-year old
quickly answers that he will “forget
about wrestling forever,” but upon
consideration he retracts that by say-
ing “Once you are away from this
sport for awhile, you start to miss it.
I’m sure that I’ll come back soon.”
After his graduation in June, the ac-
counting major has a job waiting for
him in Short Hills, NJ, at the ac-
counting firm of Pete Marwick &
Co.

But all of that seems very dis-
tant now. His concentration and tal-
ents are focused towards the task at
hand, victory in Iowa City.

Coach Ferraro likes the

wrestler’s chances. “His major
strength is that he is unorthodox. He
has the ability to take an opponent to
his back from many different posi-
tions. His pin records show this
ability and that is what makes him
so successful. I think he has a great
chance to be an All-American again
and realistically he has the potential
to win it all, as long as he wrestles
smart and doesn’t make any mis-
takes.”

\ As difficult as it may be, a
national championship appears a
very possible conclusion to the ca-
reer of one of the best ever to com-
pete for the Bison.

Athlete of the Week

BILL COURTNEY ’92

Co-captain Bill Courtney ’92 is selected Athlete of the Week for
being named to the All-Patriot League First Team.
Courtney set Bucknell records this year for most points in a

season (619), most twenty point games in a season, and total free throws

made.

Courtney led the Patriot League with most points for the season,
scoring average, and free throw percentage. He was listed among the
top fifteen players for field goal percentage, three-point field goal per-

centage, steals, and assists.

Men’s, women’s track
go to IC4A’s, Easterns

Last weekend Bucknell’s Pa-
triot League Champion men’s in-
door track and field team sent nine
athletes to the IC4A Championships
at Princeton University while the
Lady Bison sent seven runners to
Yale University for the Eastern
Championships.

George Mason University
won the men’s team title handily,
scoring over one hundred points.
The import-laden team from our
nation’s capital cleared up its visa
problems in time to beat second-
place Penn State University.

The Nittany Lions regained
their school’s pride by holding off
West Virginia University for the
women’s team championship.

Both of Bucknell’s distance
medley relay teams finished in the
top ten. The men’s contingent of
Dave Slupe 93, Jean Simon °94,

Tom Eagleson '93, and Jason
Cahilly ’92 placed sixth with a time
of 10:14.1.

The women’s relay team that
had Beth Muehl 94 run the half-
mile, Gina Abraham °93 the three-
quarter-mile, co-captain Alison
Saeger °91 the quarter-mile, and
Kristin Opdyke °93 the mile,
grabbed tenth place.

After getting off to a slow
start, Matt Deardorff ’92 raced back
to finish fourth in the 5000-meter.
Bob Kelly ’92 also competed in the
event.

Jim Bock ’92 drew the envi-
ous task of having to square off
against Notre Dame’s Raghib
Ismail. The Rocket (no clipping
flags were thrown this time) went on
to defeat Bock and win the event.

Other Bison men who com-
peted at the championship were Paul

Men’s swimming returns
from Eastern regionals

peted in the 500-meter, 55-meter,
and long jump, respectively.

“It was a good experience for
us and we’re looking forward to the
outdoor season,” commented one of
the Lady Bison following the cham-
pionship.

YO.

YOU ASKED

By Mitch Benton
Staff Writer

In the final competition of
their 1990-91 season, four members
of Bucknell’s Men’s Swimming and
Diving Squad swam in the Eastern
Regional Championships. The re-
gional meet, held last weekend at
Princeton University, was domi-
nated by the host school. Princeton
finished on top with a total of 645
points and was trailed by Harvard,
with 547.5 points, and Penn State,
with 478. These three schools, tra-
ditionally dominant in eastern
swimming, also comprised the top
three in the Women’s Easterm’s, held
Feb. 21-23.

Bucknell’s foursome amassed
9.5 points over the three days, rank-
ing them 23rd in the competition. At
last year’s championships, held at
West Point, NY., the team finished
20th, totaling 39 points.

Leading the Bison in
Princeton was sophomore sprinter
Jay Gross, who competed in three
individual events, including the 50
and 100 yard freestyle and the 100
yard butterfly. Gross’ top perfor-
mance came in the 100 free in which
he finished eighth with a time of
46.04, the second fastest time in
school history, behind only Jim
Harvey’s 44,37 set in 1988.

Also competing in individual
events was Don Steenson 92, who

swam in the 100 and 200 yard back-
stroke. Steenson teamed with Gross,
Chad Farrell ’92 and Kevin Schroth
’92 in two relays as well. The 200
yard medley relay team finished
15th, with a time of 1:35.35. Al-
though the 400 yard medley relay
finished 18th in the standings, their
time of 3:28.10 was the best this year
and the fourth best of all-time.

All four of the swimmers who
went to Princeton will return next
year to guide the Bison men’s
swimming and diving team, as they
try to better this year’s third place
conference finish and 1-10 regular
season record.

Bison fall to Fordham, finish 18-13

By Kirk Peters
Staff Writer

The men's basketball team
saw its season come to an end last
Friday evening, when they lost to the
Fordham Rams for the third time this
season in the semi-finals of the Pa-
triot League tournament. The team
finished the year with an overall
record of 18-13 and a conference
record of 7-5

“Seventeen wins was some-
thing we talked about at the begin-
ning of the season,” remarked As-

es F

sistant Coach Terry Conrad. “We
had a good year.”

The Breakin’ Bison’s final
game was much like their previous
two encounters with Fordham. The
Rams got hot early, jumping out to a
24-10 lead behind Fred Herzog and
Patriot League Player of the Year
Damon Lopez, who was named
Sports Illustrated Player of the Week
for his efforts in the tourney.

The Bison, however, refused
to let that early run end the game.
Paul Olkowski ’93 kept Bucknell
close with 10 points in the first half.

Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian

Mike Bright ’93 waits for a rebound with Fordham's Damon Lopez
during the Bison’s 82-76 Patriot League Championship Semi-final loss
in Worchester, MA. Lopez was named the tournament’s MVP.

Olkowski scored on a variety of
shots, including a key three-pointer
and a tough reverse lay-up.

The Bison, who had been
down by at least seven for most of
the half, cut the lead to five with 40
seconds left as Russ Peyton ’93 hit a
lay-up created by a Mike Bright ’93
steal. Lopez, however, destroyed
any momentum Bucknell had gen-
erated with a dunk at the buzzer.
Lopez finished the half with 13
points and $125 in back rent for his
residence in the offensive lane.

The Bison remained resilient
in the second half. Fordham ex-
tended its lead to twelve points at 49-
37 before the Bison made their best
run of the game.

Over the next 5:29, Bucknell
went on a 14-4 spurt to cut
Fordham’s lead to only two points.
Keith Fenton ’91, Bright, and Bill
Courtney °92 all hit key three-point-
ers during that stretch.

The Bison’s run forced the
Rams to call a time-out to regroup.
They regrouped well, and quickly
built their lead back to seven points.
During that stretch, junior guard
Jean Prioleau devastated Bucknell
the with his sharp shooting from the
outside when the Bison double-
teamed Lopez down low.

Bucknell managed another
mini-run to cut the lead to four
points with 1:35 left, but they could
never catch the Rams, who went on
to win 82-76.

All five Bison starters finished
the game scoring in double figures,
but the Rams got 26 points from
Lopez, 23 from Prioleau, and 21
from Herzog to finish of Bucknell.
Bill Courtney lead Bucknell with 15.

“It's always disappointing to
lose. We came in thinking we could
win,” remarked co-captain Fenton,
“but when it happens against a team
as good as they are its easier to take.”

Fordham went on to win the
tournament in an overtime thriller
against Holy Cross. The Crusaders
had erased a 14-point deficit when
Lopez sat down with four fouls, but
lost when Prioleau drilled a three-
pointer at the end of the first over-
time.

The Rams went on to be upset

Lady Bison conclude their
season with first round loss

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The women’s basketball team
concluded what has been a rough
season last Friday as they bowed out
in the first round of the Patriot
League tournament to Fordham 103-
75. The loss dropped Bucknell’s
record to 2-24 overall and 1-11 in
league play.

“Basically Fordham played as
well as they could have played,” said
point-guard Caroline Shantz "91. “T
don’t think we expected them to

come out with such intensity and
they ended up playing real well.”
The first six minutes of the
game saw the scoring going back
and forth with the two teams sharing
the lead seven times. After Juliet
McGee ’93 sank two free throws to
give the Lady Bison a 16-15 lead the
Lady Rams went on a tear to make
sure Bucknell wouldn’t get close
again. Sparked by accurate outside
shooting from forward Kristie
Kennedy and sloppy ball handling
by Bucknell, Fordham went on 15-4
point run over the next six minutes

Bucknellian File Photo

Julie Bachman GR, seen here passing in a game against Princeton
earlier this season, is one of two starters whowill be graduating.

to grab a 30-20 lead. The Lady
Rams got the lead as high as 16
points, but thanks to a late run by
Bucknell they went into the locker
room up by 7 points at 46-39.

“We felt pretty confident go-
ing in to the locker room at half after
the run,” said Shantz, “but we didn’t
have it in the second half, which has
been typical of our play this year.”

Bucknell did begin the half
looking like they might upset the
second-seeded Lady Rams, as they
closed the gap to two points on a
Kelly Dee ’94 jumper with 16:30 left
to play.

Fordham reserve guard
Heather Donlon responded to Dee’s
jumper by shooting two consecutive
three-pointers to push the lead to 8
points at 57-49. Bucknell’s shoot-
ing then deteriorated as they were
unable to find the basket, allowing
Kennedy and Donlon to take over as
they combined for 22 points in the
second half. Bucknell went on to
shoot only 33 percent from the field.

The season wasn’t a loss for a
few of the players as Julie Bachman
GR was named to the Patriot League
first team. Bachman averaged 17.6
points and 6.1 rebounds in league
play, and also led the league in three-
point shooting, hitting 34 of 73 fora
.466 percentage. Kelly Dee was
named the rookie of the year by the

“Kelly definitely deserves the

Several members of the

Courtney also broke the

“We all really enjoyed playing

The Bison can already begin
to look forward to next year. Con-

The Bison grapplers closed the
book on their season with a third
place finish in the East Coast Wres-
tling Association tournament held
Friday. Coach Bob Ferraro ex-
pressed ‘‘mixed emotions” about the
results, despite the fact that Bucknell
produced three champions on the
day. The team now looks to regroup
for next year as they prepare for the
loss of their top three wrestlers.

The Bison finished with 73
points on the day, third only to Rider
with 99, and Central Connecticut
State with 83.25. Four other teams
finished behind Bucknell. In the
past four years, the grapplers have
never finished lower than second
place. While the finish was some-
what disappointing, there were a few
bright spots, most notably the
crowning of three Bison champions.
Mike Van Doren ’92 (150 Ibs.) de-
feated Dave Robin of Rider 9-1 for
the first of four victories against the
tough rival Broncs. Tom Marchetti
’91 (167 lbs.) defeated Paul Brosin
of Rider 5-1 for his third consecu-

tive championship. Finally, Bryan .

Co-Captain Bill Courtney ’92 penetrates during the first half of last
Friday’s game against the Rams. Courtney averaged 20 points a game
to lead the Bison and the Patriot League. He’ll return next season to
lead what should be a formidable Bucknell attack that returns three
other starters: Mike Bright ’93, Paul Olkowski ’93, and Pat King ’92.
Keith Fenton ’91, who attempted a Bison single-season record 150
three-pointers, is the lone graduate among the starting five.

Wrestlers end season with
third place finish at ECWA’s

Scarper of Rider 10-2 for the third
consecutive year. All three wrestlers
will go to compete in the NCAA’s in
Iowa a week from Saturday.

The Bison also finished with
four third place finishes in the tour-
nament. They included Ben Myers
’91 (Heavyweight), Ken Herceg ’92
(177 Ibs.), Mike Salone ’92 (158
Ibs.), and Phil Elliot ’93 (134 Ibs.).
Bucknell did not produce any second
place finishes.

Coach Ferraro was decidedly
mixed in his analysis of the tourna-
ment. “I felt eight people wrestled
very well, but there were also two
let-downs.” The team entered the
tournament with three top seeds, the
three eventual champions. They also
had one second seed, Herceg, whose
third place finish came after losing
to the same wrestler he beat at Cen-
tral Connecticut weeks earlier.
Myers and Elliot were both
unseeded wrestlers coming in, while
Salone was the third seed.

Ferraro maintains that the Bi-
son were capable of winning the
tournament, but that several key
losses pointed the team in the wrong
direction. “There were a couple of
losses that made winning unrealistic.
Chris Ducas [’91] did not wrestle up

to his potential after struggling all
season, and Herceg lost to a guy he
beat earlier.” Ducas was also the
defending conference champ enter-
ing the day.

Ferraro continues to look
Positively on the season, saying,
“This does not put a damper on what
we’ve accomplished. We had a
tough schedule, and we would have
had to wrestle extremely well for a
winning season.” As for next year,
the Bison will be losing Marchetti,
Bums, and Ducas, three of the best
wrestlers Bucknell has seen in recent
years. “Obviously its difficult to
lose guys who have set records for
most wins [in a career],” said
Ferraro. “But overall we will be a
better team with more balance. We
will have several new additions, and
we will be young. With a little ex-
perience we will get stronger as the
season progresses.”

Next year will also feature
some additions to the schedule, in-
cluding the Lehigh Invitational and
the University of North Carolina, a
team ranked in the top twenty in the
country. The two meets have been
added in hopes of raising the stan-
dards of the Bison wrestling pro-
gram in future years,

Investigation of women’s
basketball may begin Mon.

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

Nearly two weeks after
women’s head basketball coach
Lori Howard abandoned four play-
ers in Worcester, Mass., several
questions have been raised regard-
ing Bucknell teams’ alcohol policy.
Meanwhile, Athletic Director Rick
Hartzell has given Howard until
Moday to make a decision about her
future.

The controversy began after
Howard refused to allow four play-
ers aride on the team bus after their

first-round loss in the Patriot
League championships. The deci-
sion, one made in “poor judge-
ment,” according to Hartzell, came
after assistant coach Terrie Grieb
discovered the alcohol in the four
players’ hotel room.

The current alchol policy
states that: “The university does not
support or condone underage
drinking.” According to one coach,
this policy is understood to be a
strict guideline for every team on
campus to follow. The confusion
for Howard apparently stemmed
from the fact that she was unaware

of what was standard procedure for
such an incident, mainly because one
has not been written. Hartzell dis-
agrees, saying, “If I was going to
write a policy for every single thing
that is going to come up, we'd have
a book a million pages long. I think
that’s ridiculous.”

When asked whether he
thought the other coaches would
change their team’s policy regarding
alcohol violations, Hartzell replied,
“I don’t think it will have an effect
on other coaches at all. It was just
one of those things that happened. A
mistake was made. Other coaches

Phi Psi national selects
45 for interest group

Group to be initiated as chapter next semester

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Forty-five students have been
selected as the initial “interest
group” for the recolonization of Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity.

S. Michael Wallen and Chris
Brown, Phi Psi national educational
leadership consultants, have been on
campus for the past three weeks and
have conducted ninety interviews
with students interested in
recolonizing Phi Psi.

The 45 students chosen by
Wallen and Brown, led by interest
group President Matt Young °92,
will have to submit a recolonization
proposal to the Council on Greek life
and will be pledges of Phi Psi “once
we're allowed to come back as a
chapter next fall,” said Wallen.

Wallen and Brown conducted
“one on one interviews with every-
one interested,” and, according to
Wallen, “we discussed what we were
offering and we tried to see if that
was the same thing the individual
was looking for.”

Wallen explained that there
were four criteria that he and Brown
used in selecting from the candi-
dates. “We were looking for, first
and foremost, academic achieve-
ment,” with members “at or above
the all-male grade point average... or
at or above the average for their par-
ticular discipline.” Wallen contin-
ued explaining this will “be the case
every semester.”

The second criterium enu-

merated by Wallen was “campus in-
volvement; we wanted leaders.”
Thirdly, Wallen and Brown looked
for “community minded people”
who were involved in Lewisburg
and surrounding areas. Finally,
Wallen explained that there was “a
philosophical question, and that was
what the individual was looking for
... that he wasn’t looking for any of
the negatives.”

Wallen did explain that “it is
obvious that each individual could
not have all of these.” He
that the all-male GPA requirement
wauld be one in which there would
only be case-by-case exceptions. Of
there were
three exceptions in the interest
group, according to Wallen.

In order to move toward rec-
ognition, the interest group has set
up a committee structure for both
internal and external concerns, Ac-
cording to Wallen, there are IFC,
Panhel, and BSG liaisons from the
interest group. Also, the group will
educate itself about the history and
tradition of Phi Psi.

When the group becomes a
colony in the fall they will go
through a dynamic “six to cight
week educational period” which ac-
cording to Wallen, “is purely an in-
tellectual process with no chores,
tasks, duties, or obstacles.” At the
end of the period, the group will take
the national exam and, upon passing,
be activated.

The group will not have a
house for the fall semester said Ed

did say

the forty-five chosen,

Dadez, dean of residential life
Dadez did say that there is an “out-
side shot for January.” Of more im-
mediate concern, Dadez explained
that “what we’ ll have to deal with in
the next few weeks is if the group
wants to be together, where we will
put them.”

Young noted that this is not of
primary importance to him since
“we're going to be together, regard-
less of whether we live together or
not, because of meetings and other
events

Although Phi Psi is coming
back in the fall, Wallen explained
that “recruitment never sleeps. Rush
It is
making friends and meeting people,

for us is not a formal thing

and being very inclusive.”

Wallen also noted that chap-
ter meetings will be open to anyone
wishing to attend. “That's how you
learn, by opening up your meetings.”
Young added, “It shouldn’t be con-
ducted in secret; we have nothing to
hide.”

Both Young and Wallen were
positive about the recolonization and
Phi Psi’s future role on campus.

Young explained, “I feel very
positive about the group of men we
have now and I hope we can create
our own space within the university
and help make the Greek system a
little better.” Wallen echoed the
sentiment, “For us, it’s a challenge
as a fraternity to come back and be
the best we can be. We found many
men who will carry on our
fraternity’s name in a fine sense.”

Philip Roth to give reading
in honor of former professor

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

Every author writes about his
past. For Philip Roth “54, contem-
porary writer, the past includes
Bucknell University. Roth, who
graduated from Bucknell, will return
on Apr. | to Bucknell Hall to read
excerpts from his latest novel, Pat-
rimony. The book itself has nothing
to do with Roth’s college years - it
deals with his father’s death - but he
will give the reading in honor of
Mildred Martin, Emerita professor
of English, with whom he still keeps
in touch.

Martin, a professor at Buck-
nell from 1940 to 1972, taught Roth
in two courses. Roth was one of
eight students who completed her
senior honors seminar, an advanced
writing course which she referred to
as The Seminar. Roth describes the
course, for which he could be ex-
pected to hand in 60 pages of critical
writing cach week, in his autobiog-
raphy, The Facts, as “the backbone
of my undergraduate education.”

Even as an undergraduate,
Roth was “already very good,”

Other coaches were not as

stating that a team must know its
parameters. “We've used contracts
in the past,” said the coach, “but I
think it is abundantly clear what the
policy is, and it does not need to be
written out.” Head football coach
Lou Maranzana also remarked,
“Our policy is ‘Don’t embarass the
team.’” This rule is understood by
all members of the team, he claims.
Hartzell explained also that,

Athletic Director Rick Hartzell claims that despite the abandonment
of four women basketball players by head coach Lori Howard, there
is not a need for written University policies for athletic teams.

while Howard has yet to make a
choice, her decision must come next
week at the latest. “Monday at noon
is the time frame with which we
talked,” he said from Louisville on
Wednesday. When asked whether
this decision would include quitting
her position, Hartzell refused to
comment.

Hartzell said last week that a
“full and in-depth” review of the
basketball team would come in the
next month, unless Howard decides
to quit before then. While she is to
make a decision by Monday, the na-
ture of that choice is unknown.
Howard has refused to comment
thus far.

Faculty express concern
about merit pay system

By Steve Hoerter
Staff Writer

over the
versity’s merit based salary sys-

Controversy

urfaced at last week’s faculty

ting. Steve Becker, professor of

ysics, brought into question the

quity and effectiveness of the cur-

nt system.
now many

The issue centers on
faculty members are
given a‘ merit raise, the
highest raise category in the system,
and whether or not this number has
exceeded limits set forth by the fac-
ulty in the early 1980s.

According to Larry Shinn,
vice president for academic affairs,
“The percentage of faculty receiving
an extraordinary rating has been
moving up very slowly.” Shinn
added that the criteria for determin-
ing who receives a level three raise
have likewise been strengthened.
“The standards really have gone up,”
Shinn said. In 1990, according to
Shinn, the percentage of faculty re-
ceiving level three raises was in the
mid-twenty percent range. In 1984
the figure was approximately five
percentage points lower.

There are three different lev-
els of merit that are used in the sys-
tem: satisfactory (level one), meri-
torious (level two) and very merito-
rious (level three). The difference
between the categories, while not
specifically spelled out in any Uni-
versity document, is determined by
an evaluation of each professor’s
activities during the previous three
year period.

The evaluation process begins
with the presentation of the
professor’s vita to his or her depart-
ment chair. Vitae generally contain
student evaluations, published ar-
ticles and written justification for
merit level placement. The depart-
ment chair then makes a merit pay
recommendation to the either the
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences or the Dean of the College
of Engineering, depending upon
which College the department is in.
These two recommendations are
then passed on to the Council of
Deans, composed of both Deans and
the Vice President for Academic
Affairs, Larry Shinn. This council
collectively makes the final deci-
sion. According to Shinn, approxi-
mately 50 percent of the recom-
mendations are for level three raises,
of which approximately 25 percent
are granted.

The merit pay system is
supplemented by an across the board
raise that generally reflects cost of
living adjustments (COLAs). Theo-
retically, all faculty salaries are ad-
justed for inflation in addition to a
merit raise of some sort.

level three”

Becker asserts that in 1980,
when the current merit based salary
system was introduced by Richard
McGinnis, professor of civil engi-
neering, quotas were assigned to the
number of faculty permitted in each
category of merit. Faculty meeting
minutes from the time period do use
the term “quota” — the current in-
terpretation of the term by Shinn has
been “a guideline to be taken seri-
ously.”

According to a document cir-
culated to all faculty members in
November of last year, guidelines
exist for the percentage of faculty
that should be placed in each cat-
egory. According to this document,
the satisfactory category “may con-
tain 5S to 10% of the faculty,” the
meritorious level 75 to 80% and the
very meritorious level “not less than
10% nor more than 20% of the fac-
ulty.”

The Board of Trustees gener-
ated the initial push for the imple-
mentation of a merit salary system
in the late 1970s, according to
Becker. Richard Henry, professor of
physics and a member of the Com-
mittee on Personnel during the time,
recalls the debate surrounding the
initial proposal. “The trustees said
you’ve got to have a merit system.
And [the current system] was a way
of ducking it.” In response to the
push, the faculty’s Committee on
Personnel began work on a proposal
that would satisfy both the Board’s
concerns and the faculty’s concerns.

The result was the McGinnis
proposal made in late 1980, which is
still in use today. In an interview
yesterday, McGinnis said, “My plan
was a one year plan.” However, in
1981 the faculty voted to continue
with McGinnis’ plan. McGinnis’

proposal was not for a full merit
system, one in which all raises
would be based on merit ratings, but
was rather for one in which merit
raises were added to COLAs. In an
interview Wednesday, Becker said,
“The faculty and administration es-
sentially agreed to a system...that
isn’t a meritorious system, because
most of the faculty were supposed to
fall in the middle category.”

Becker believes that the ad-
ministration is simply ignoring the
quotas set forth by the faculty in
1980. This increase in the number of
faculty in the level three category,
according to Becker and other fac-
ulty members, yields a heightened
sense of competition within a de-
partment. “Colleagues cease to be
colleagues — they become com-
petitors,” Becker said.

Michael Moohr, professor of
Economics and chair of the depart-
ment, sees the entire system in a
somewhat different light. “We
haven't liked the merit pay system
because it calls into question one’s
professionalism. If we were moti-
vated by money we would not have
chosen this profession,” Moohr said
in an interview earlier this week

The department of economics,
as a result, asks to be judged collec-
tively, according to Moohr. He said,
“We’ve always asked to be judged
collectively; we see ourselves as a
department. We’ re not freelancers.”

Shinn’s outlook is a bit differ-
ent, “I personally do not see the
meril system as a motivating system,
rather a recognition system.” Ac-
cording to McGinnis, the difference
between a level two and level three
raise amounted to about $400 in
1990.

Washers, dryers made
tamper-resistant

By Mark Leister
Staff Writer

University washers and dryers
were recently made tamper-proof in
order to prevent illegal operation of
the 102 coin-operated machines.
The physical plant requested the
modifications after discovering that
people were tampering with the
machines so they would operate
without coins.

According to Bob Millward,
manager of buildings, the University
lost nearly $8,000 in washer and
dryer income last year, an abrupt
change from the $9,000 and $13,000
increases for each of the two prior
years.

It was not until early January
that the physical plant staff was able
to determine the method by which
people were cheating the machines.
At that point, physical plant con-
tacted Diehl’s TV and Appliances,
which supplies and maintains the
machines for the University.

Diehl’s informed Millward
that replacing the coin mechanisms

Still only 5¢ a copy

would cost $16 per machine, a
price the physical plant was un-
willing to bear. Instead, the Uni-
versity opted to modify the existing
mechanisms at a cost of $7 per
machine. Millward stated that
Diehl’s agreed to perform the nec-
essary work and accept half of the
cost. According to Millward,
modifications began in mid-Febru-
ary and all of the washers and dry-
ers will be tamper-resistant by the
end of March.

Though tampering problems
have been reported at some local
universities, the situation appears.
to be college specific. According to
Bill Kurtz, manager of Dichl’s, his
company’s problems with machine
tampering have been confined to
the Bucknell campus.

In-town laundries have re-
portedly remained unaffected. For
example, Julie Jasiewics, co-owner
of Wash Tubs Laundries, a self-
service Lewisburg establishment
which owns machines similar to
Bucknell’s, has noticed no signifi-
cant losses.

Campus furniture theft
reaches all-time high

By Elizabeth Danneberg
Staff Writer

In the past year, Bucknell has
suffered from more university fur-
niture theft than ever. Such items as
chairs, lamps, bean bags, and
loveseats, have continually been
stolen from Roberts, Larison, and
Harris Halls, the Bertrand Library
and other buildings. Many times
this furniture is temporarily “bor-
rowed” from students, only to show
up back in place during breaks
when rooms are checked.

Library furniture, however, is
usually not returned to its place vol-
untarily. For example, just recently,
four bean bags and a globe stolen
from the library, were found in the
halls and library of Hunt Hall, soon
after custodians had told residents
that security officers would be
checking the premises. In addition,
last Saturday night, two chairs were
taken from the after hours section of
the library only to be found two
days later outside the library.

When asked of her opinion of
the recent library thefts, Joanne
Young, associate director for library
services, commented that, “We in
the library want to provide the kind

of facility that students like to have.
Students seem to like an informal
atmosphere, so it is unfortunate that
a few made it uncomfortable for the
whole.” Young also said that it is
lack of consideration for other stu-
dents that is most distressing to her.

Though numerous pieces of
furniture have been stolen from
residence hall lounges, affecting
many students, Gerry Commerford,
assistant dean for housing, says that
Bucknell is not going to replace the
furniture. “We can’t keep pouring
money down the drain. Students are
often quick to complain about the
cost of Bucknell, so in order to keep
the cost down, the students them-
selves must make sure things stay
in place,” said Commerford. He
added that in a case such as the
basement of Harris Hall, where all
the furniture has been stolen, the
room will remain empty.
Commerford suggested that empty
rooms may be used for other pur-
poses in the future.

According to the Office of
Security and Safety, those who
have been found in possession of
University property are subject to
disciplinary action and/or arrest.

Merit pay

From page |

According to Barry Maxwell,
vice president for administration and
former dean of the college of engi-
neering, departments are not forced
to participate in the system. There-
fore, not all departments take part in
the process.

Henry, while in favor of the
merit system, said, “I don’t like it
when too many people get the top
merit unit.” In an interview this
week, Henry likened the potential
Situation to grade inflation. “If fifty
percent of the students in a class get
A’s the other fifty percent is going
to begin to wonder why they didn’t
get A’s too.” According to several
professors interviewed, with an in-
crease in the number of faculty in the
level three category the boundaries
become blurred. Becker queried,
“How do you measure it? What does
it mean?”

McGinnis, addressing the
small percentage increase of faculty
in level three, said, “If that’s all
we've done in ten years, we’ve done
a great job at holding the line.” He
added, “I'd like to see more of a fi-
nancial difference [between levels
two and three].”

Shinn defended the system in
an interview last night. “At most in-
stitutions merit increases are given
every year to all faculty. Often they
have two, three, four, even five cat-
egories. We only have three catego-
ries.” Accounting for the slow in-
crease of faculty in the level three
category he added, “What I see
coming down the road is a very
strong, young faculty.” Shinn said,
“Tt may well be that the faculty per-
sonnel committee will want to ad-
dress this issue.”

for a fire alarm activation received by Security. Blaze was partially
extinguished by a student and Security removed the partially flaming
couch to the outdoors and extinguished the remaining fire. A dropped
cigarette may have been the cause of the fire.

Two calls, on at 12:09 am and one at 11:16 pm were received by
Security for fire alarm activations at Smith Hall. Upon Security’s arrival
at both times, it was discovered that unknown person(s) pulled a pull
station activating the alarm for no apparent reason.

Saturday 3/9

Three fire alarm activations were received by Security on this
date. Two in Smith Hall, one at 9:49 pm, one at 1:38 am and another in
Swartz at 2:48 am. All three incidents were tampering with fire appa-
ratus by unknown individual(s) for no apparent reason. The perpetrator
of the incident at Swartz Hall was witnessed and a description was ob-
tained.

Several real estate signs were recovered on Bucknell property.
“For Sale” signs were placed in front of fraternities on Frat Road. All
were taken to Security and returned to local real estate agencies.

Sunday 3/10

Security received fire alarm activations at 11:28 pm in Larison
Cottage, 3:36 am and again at 6:03 am in Larison Hall. All were the acts
of unknown individual(s) removing a smoke detector, expelling 2 fire
extinguishers, and pulling a pull station for no reason whatsoever,

Further action will be taken against two Bucknell students for
trespassing in the tunnel between the Bertrand Library and the Weis
Center. Security had received a tunnel intrusion alarm, responded, and
found the two students.

A visitor of a student required medical attention at Evangelical
Hospital. Visitor, in an angry state, hit a window in Larison Hall with
his head, which required stitches. Visitor will pay restitution to Buck-
nell for the damages.

Security responded to Swartz Hall between B Wing and C Wing
on the report of a fire in a dumpster. Security extinguished the flames.
No information as to how the dumpster caught fire.

A visitor, who was visiting a student at Chi Phi, was found ina
student’s room in SPE Fraternity at 7:30 pm this date. When SPE brother
awoke, he found individual standing there holding his disc player. SPE
brother found his watch missing and contacted the individual the visitor
was staying with. Watch was returned and no charges brought against
the visitor who left campus.

A Bucknell student will be charged for leaving the scene of an
auto accident without making proper notification. Student admitted to
hitting two autos in the Mod area and leaving the scene, Evidence was
collected from the site by East Buffalo Police Department and vehicle
at fault was located in the Lewisburg area, leading to the identification

Social changes inevitable

By Charlie Collier

“The social patterns on the
Bucknell campus have to change”
according to Denis Maguire ’93,
president of the Inter-fraternity
Council (IFC), This change is nei-
ther the sole decision of the IFC nor
the University; rather it is the pres-
sure from some fraternities’ national

‘organizations to move to a “Bring

Your Own Beer” (BYOB) policy
that is forcing Bucknell to consider
how its social life must change as

‘early as next semester.

“The social scene will change
dramatically” according to Michael
Powers ’92, president of Delta Up-
silon fraternity. “The party scene is
going to move from big blow-outs
on Friday and Saturday nights to
smaller mixer-type parties.” He also
noted that “people are going to party
in their rooms a lot more and earlier.
Big weekends like House Party
Weekend might be less emphasized
or big parties might even disappear
if things work out the way they look
like they might.”

The proposed policy shiftis of
concern to sororities as well as fra-
ternities. Kristine Elliott ’92, presi-

dent of the Panhellenic Council
(Panhel), shares the opinion that
“people are going to try and drink
more elsewhere and then go up to the
houses even more drunk than be-
fore.” Noting the policy is not all
bad however, she admitted “there are
pros and there are cons to it.” A
BYOB policy will serve the purpose
of “making each person responsible
for their own drinking,” which re-
lieves some of the burden from those
organizations who are presently the
sole providers of alcohol.

When asked if a policy like
BYOB can be effective on our cam-
pus, Elliott noted that “it will defi-
nitely increase the amount of re-
sponsibility that fraternities and so-
rorities have to take during the party
to monitor what’s coming in and
what’s leaving.” Powers added that
whether BYOB works or not is “not
our decision to make rightnow. We
are being dictated to by the insurance
companies through our nationals on
how we are going to have to do these
things.” The consensus seems to be
that BYOB must work if fraternities
wish to exist as nationally recog-
nized organizations on this campus.

Other schools, among them

the University of Pennsylvania, have
already tried a BYOB policy, said
Powers, but Penn is one of the
schools where it is unsuccessful.
“They’ve gone BYOB, and offi-
cially they are BYOB, but it’s not
working there. Eventually what’s
going to happen is that charters are
going to be pulled and houses are
going to be in severe trouble” re-
marked Powers.

What all of this seems to mean
is that social change is on the way
whether the IFC, the University, or
the students necessarily want it or
not. “I think we’re going to struggle
socially for a while but once we get
in a routine with the BYOB policy
where nobody knows the difference,
then I see some positive things going
on in terms of the social life on
campus” said Maguire. Everyone
made it clear that they want no one
to be surprised by what seems to be
this inevitable change. Jennifer
Shore ’92, Panhel public relations
chairperson, explained that “people
have to know when they leave in
June, that when they come back at
the end of August BYOB is the way
itis going to be.”

By David Murray
Staff Writer

The members of the Inter-fra-
ternity Council (IFC) debated the
future of a “Bring Your Own Beer”
(BYOB) policy on campus at their
meeting Tuesday night. The policy
is being brought about mainly be-
cause of pressure from the fraterni-
ties’ national organizations.

According to Ed Dadez, asso-
ciate dean of residential life, many
national fraternity organizations
purchase liability insurance from the
Fraternity Insurance Purchasing
Group (FIPG) or from a similar plan.
A new risk management policy,
adopted by FIPG-type insurance
companies, stipulates that “no alco-
holic beverages may be purchased
through the chapter treasury nor may
the purhcase of same for members or
guests be undertaken or coordinated
by any member in the name or on
behalf of the chapter.”

Two chapters that do not fall

under these guidelines are Sigma
Chi and Kappa Sigma. While the
Sigma Chi national organization
does purchase FIPG insurance for its
chapters which want it, the Bucknell
chapter of Sigma Chi is not under-
written by the national or by FIPG.
Similarly, Kappa Sigma does not
purchase insurance from FIPG.

While the official IFC BYOB
policy is not yet finalized, discussion
at Tuesday’s meeting centered on
the policy’s implementation. Sev-
eral fraternity representatives ex-
pressed concern that the two non-
FIPG fraternities might face a diffi-
cultchoice: abide by the IFC BYOB
regulations or maintain the freedom
they have in being separate from
FIPG.

In response to the Council’s
concern, Sigma Chi’s president,
Mark Pascarella *92 stated that his
fraternity is “willing to fully cooper-
ate because other houses are re-
quired to do so as well.” He was

cautious, however, stating “I don’t
want to see wholesale concessions
that are mandated by other fraterni-
ties’ individual insurance policies.
We need equity and parity” in the
policy. Similarly, Pete McNally ’93,
president of Kappa Sigma, an-
nounced that his fraternity would
also support an IFC BYOB resolu-
tion “if we deem the details reason-
able.”

Denis Maguire °93, IFC
president, is worried about a poten-
tial split in the IFC between those
fraternities required to change to a
BYOB policy and those who are not
not required to change.

“T hope they do follow the IFC
policy and create as little contro-
versy as possible,” Maguire said.
He recognized that the two fraterni-
ties were “in a tough situation,” but
he said “the houses should be equal
on this campus and under one rule;
and by next semester, BYOB is go-
ing to be that rule.”

INTERNATIONAL

Soviets to hold
referendum

As the March 17 referendum
nears, rallies have occurred in sev-
eral Soviet cities this week. More
than 100,000 people marched
through Moscow on Monday de-
manding Mikhail Gorbachev’s res-
ignation and supporting a “no” vote
in the referendum on Sunday.

The referendum will ask So-
viet voters, “Do you support the
preservation of the Union as a re-
newed federation of sovereign re-
publics in which the rights of a per-
son of any nationality are fully
guaranteed?”

These rallies have turned
Sunday’s referendum into a face-off
between President Gorbachev with
his group of Communists, centists,
and conservatives, and the liberals,
nationalists, and reformers who have
supported Boris Yeltsin, the leader
of the Russian Republic. With
thousands of Soviets participating in
rallies, the growing opposition be-
tween these two groups and their
leaders has become more and more
noticeable.

Even though Mr. Yeltsin has
insisted that he has no desire to re-
place Mr. Gorbachev as the Soviet
president, Mr. Yeltsin has called for
Mr. Gorbachev’s resignation, for a
dissolution of central powers, and
for a rapid introduction of a free
market.

Policy to break
apartheid

South African President F. W.
de Klerk introduced legislation to
abolish all racial discrimination in
land ownership. This new law,
which is one of the most significant
steps taken to break down the barri-
ers of apartheid, allows South Afri-
cans to live where they choose.

Under old laws, nearly 87 per-
cent of the country’s land has been
reserved for South Africa’s white
minority of 5 million which now
constitutes about 13 percent of the
total population of about 37.5 mil-
lion. The new legislation, which is
expected to be approved by the end
of June, should put an end to resi-
dential segregation and set right the
inequality in land ownership be-
tween the country’s black majority
and its white minority.

Although four old laws are to
be repealed and this new policy in-
stated, the new legislation has failed
to offer any restitution to an esti-
mated 3.5 million black South Afri-
cans who were dispossessed during
the last three decades by white mi-
nority governments. These blacks
can only go home if they buy back
the property from which they were
evicted.

Serbia gives in
to protesters

Serbia, Yugoslavia’s largest
republic, gave in Wednesday to the
three-day protest led by anti-Com-
munist demonstrators in Belgrade.
After an estimated crowd of 100,000
filled the capital’s downtown area
earlier this week, the Yugoslav gov-
ernment acceded to the major de-
mands of the protesters.

The government agreed to
dismiss the directors of the televi-
sion station who the protests had
held responsible for what they called

propagandist news programs. In ad-
dition, it gave in to the protests of the
students by releasing Vuk
Draskovic, head of the nationalist
Serbian Renewal movement, from
prison where he had been since he
organized the initial mass protest on
Saturday.

Even though student leaders
are satisfied with these actions taken
by the government, many in the
crowd declared that they would stay
in Belgrade until Yugoslavia’s
President Milosevic and his party
had been forced from power.

Gettysburg tests
BYOB policy

A new BYOB policy was
tested last Friday night at Gettysburg
College. An estimated crowd of 500
attended the all-campus party held in
Gettysburg’s gym. The party
marked the first time that the
college’s current BYOB policy was
practiced.

The new BYOB policy allows
for those 21 and over to bring six 12-
ounce beers into a party and leave
them in coolers until they want them.
Some stipulations to the new policy
include that parties must be under
250 people and that the hosts of the
party must go through the Alcohol
Education class and a new class on
how to spot fake IDs.

Budgetary cuts
to effect UPJ

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Oakland campus has decided to
make the Pitt-Johnstown campus a
budget cut for next year. As a result
of these budgetary constraints, ad-
ministrative vacancies have been
forced to remain empty.

The position of director of
continuing education has been va-
cant for one year; the position of as-
sistant Academic Dean has been va-
cant for almost two years; and the
position of assistant director of aux-
iliary services has been vacant for
the past three years. It is not that
these positions have been eliminated
entirely but that the Pitt-Johnstown
campus does not have the money to

Gans to speak
on abortion

Miss Olivia Gans, director of
American Victims of Abortion, will
be giving a lecture entitled “Legal-
ized Abortion: Freedom or Failure
for Women?” on Tuesday, March 19
at 8 p.m. in Vaughan Literature Au-
ditorium. The lecture is sponsored
by Bucknellians for Human Life,
and the Bucknell Student Lecture-
ship Committee.

In 1981 Gans was an unwed,
unemployed 22-year-old part-time
student when, due to outside pres-
sures, she underwent an abortion in
the fourth month of her pregnancy.
She became AVA director in 1985,
and has spoken on post abortion
syndrome and other abortion issues
throughout the United States and
abroad, including Great Britain,
Canada, Ireland, Italy, and Australia.
Miss Gans regularly appears on tele-
visions shows such as Donahue,
Sally Jesse Raphael, Good Morning
America, and Nightline. Miss Gans
was also seen by thousands last year
on C-Span as the emcee for National
Right to Life’s Rally for Life, *90.

US Jobless rate
rises to 6.5%

The unemployment rate rose
to its highest point in four years dur-
ing February reaching 6.5 percent,
The jobless rate was up from 6,2
percent in January. This increase of
three-tenths of one percentage point
put 450,000 individuals out of work
in February.

For the second time in two
months, the Federal Reserve re-
sponded to the worsening recession
by lowering interest rates another
notch. By cutting interest rates, it
hopes to increase borrowing and
thereby generate economic growth
through increased spending by com-
panies and individuals. Even though
the Bush administration predicts the
economy may pull out of the reces-
sion by late spring or early summer,
this move by the Federal Reserve, in
addition to many economists’ views,
show otherwise.

Low-fat burger
has real beef

McDonald’s intends to make a
hamburger that is lower in fat avail-
able in restaurants on April 26. This
is the first low-fat hamburger offered
at any fast-food chain nationwide to
use real beef.

This low-fat burger which has
been called the McLean Deluxe uses
a new process that substitutes water
for some of the fat. This process re-
duces the level of fat in the ham-
burger to 9 percent which is half the
level of the company’s larger ham-
burgers, like the Quarter Pounder.

The low-fat hamburger would
be offered in addition to McDon-
ald’s other burgers. It will probably
have about 310 calories and be
served without cheese and with a
low-fat mayonnaise dressing. It is
expected to sell for about the same
price as the McD.L.T.

McDonald’s reason for its in-
troduction of the low-fat hamburger
1s to counter sluggish sales and vari-
Ous growing criticisms of its food.
In addition, this is only one of many
attempts by the fast-food industry to
heed consumer concerns about fat
and cholesterol.

WVBU radio show plays prisoners’ requests

Okay, we were discussing
the Official List Of the Top 100
Most Desirable Traits That People
Lavk For, and the two top ranked
MOST desirable character ele-
mants are...

Mystery and Novelty

These two traits have re-
cently climbed to the top of the
ciarts as a resuit of cheesy teenage
movies that convinced us (during
our adolescent years) to believe
that somewhere out there is the
“perfect person.” According to
these flicks, this ideal mate will not
be some boring ‘friend’ who you
have pleasant daily conversations
with, but rather a mysterious and
novel stranger who you’ve never,
ever talked to before in your life.

Remember “Sixteen Cand-
les?” It’s the movie in which a
sensitive, decent girl (Samantha)
decides on her 16th birthday that
she’s in love with a “mysterious”
senior guy named Jake who re-
sembles Mr. America. Well, as
Hollywood would have it, the guy
turns out to be romantic and sincere
and wonderful and charming AND.
enamored of Samantha. The movie
triumphantly ends when Jake gives
the heroine her flowered underwear
back, bakes her a birthday cake,
and drives her away to his mansion
in a snappy red car. By the way,
they live happily ever after. The
Theme: If you are a sensitive, de-
cent female, “mysterious” Gor-
geous Hunks will also be pleasant
and smart and will immediately
decide that they love and respect
you and bake you cakes....from
scratch.

Another popular teen ro-
mance movie was “Karate Kid,” in
which an honest and sincere short
guy named Daniel has a secret
crush on some beautiful yet elusive
girl named Bambi who dates a
monosyllabic, Neanderthal who
communicates primarily by using
the expression, “uhhhh.” In the

the average “Morgan” says she re-
ceives 15-20 pieces of mail a week,
often “two or three letters a week
from some of the same people.”
Around Christmastime, her listeners

oners know how much they are
missed.

Most frequently the men and
women request soul music, includ-
ing Anita Baker, Luther Vandross,

Because her listeners are confined,
and without many ways to vent
their emotions, the letters “Morgan”
receives are sometimes very
passionate and expressive...

send her cards with pictures of
themselves on the front. Families
and friends of the inmates also send
requests to “Morgan” to let the pris-

movie, after Daniel confesses his
total love for Bambi, she says
something like, “Oh Daniel,
You’re so honest and sincere!
You're just swell!! I don’t know
what I ever saw in Biff. It’s you
that I REALLY love!!!” And the
two stroll off hand in hand to go
play miniature golf. The Theme:
If you are honest, sincere, and
short, with no sign of facial hair,
attractive females who are also
compassionate and intelligent (and
have names that end in i) will jump
at the chance to be your eternal love
slave. Then you’ll learn Kung-Fu
and beat the hell out of her ex-
boyfriend.

But in real life, the climatic
confrontation between Daniel and
Bambi might have gone more like
this...

Daniel: | don’t understand
what you see in Biff?!? How can
you even hold a normal conversa-
tion with him?

Bambi: He’s so mysterious.
I want to be the one to “bring him
out of his shell” and make him
“open up!”

Daniel: He’s not mysterious
he’s an idiot!!! The only thing he
knows how to say is, “uhhhh!”

Bambi: Yes, but he uses it
so brilliantly to make his

Oh by the way, thanks
for the roses and the candies and the
cake you baked me...from scratch,
that was really “nice”. You’re like
a brother to me, but, frankly you’re
a geek. Give me a call in a few
years when you reach puberty.

Okay, suppose you are one of
those people who has given up
wading through shallow B-movie-
archetype impressionists in a
search for “mystery” and has actu-
ally found someone you can relate
to on a human level. Have you
won? Have you succeeded? Are
the sleepless nights and feelings of
confusion and insignificance over?

continues to keep in touch with Mar-
tin through telephone calls, mail, and
the occasional visit. It is this friend-
ship which prompted Roth to contact
Jack Wheatcroft, professor of En-
glish, to schedule the reading of
Patrimony, in honor of Martin.

“Generously Philip called me
one morning and said he’d like to
come to Bucknell and do a reading
from Patrimony as a tribute to
Mildred Martin,” said Wheatcroft,
who began teaching English during
the time Roth attended Bucknell.

When Wheatcroft arranged for
Roth to do the reading in Bucknell
Hall, he left out one thing: telling
the 86-year-old Martin that the pro-
gram is in her honor. “I haven’t told
her that yet. No, I think I'll wait until
the posters are out. She’ll find out
sooner or later,” he said.

No doubt, Martin will approve
of the selection. “I think [Patrimony]
is the best book he has ever written,”
she said. Martin also likes Goodbye,
Columbus, Roth’s first book. “It’s
rather interesting that for me his
earliest and [most recent] are the
best,” she said.

In addition, Martin pointed out
a favorite passage from The Profes-
sor of Desire, published in 1977.
Paraphrasing the passage, she said,
“Only in the classroom can there be
complete honesty between the
teacher and the students,” for in the
classroom a student can accept
criticism as he is unlikely to at any
other point in his life.

Martin’s relationship with the
college-aged Roth attests to this
statement. But Roth, too, has had
plenty of chances to experience the
honesty of the classroom. “He’s now
at Hunter College, in New York
City, and he has been for several
years,” said Martin.

Martin said she suspects Roth
maintains the same classroom hon-
esty which he wrote about in The
Professor of Desire. “He likes to
teach and he has thought very well
about what good teaching is,” she
said.

Similar to the attempt at hon-
esty in the classroom, Roth’s novels,

Besides pulling the requests
before the show, “Morgan” must
also preview that week’s letters. Be-
cause her listeners are confined, and
without many ways to vent their
emotions, the letters “Morgan” re-
ceives are sometimes very passion-
ate and expressive. Some letters
have to be “filtered.” “Morgan”
commented, “I read most every-
thing, but there are some things that
just shouldn’t be read.”

When “Morgan” first started
doing the show last fall, she was
“hesitant.” Once she started to re-
ceive the grateful letters from the
prisoners though, she felt good about
what she doing. Like other “Prison

years, “Morgan” has realized that
she is doing a “great service.” By

Though Roth has been labeled, es-
pecially in reference to his early
works, as anti-Semitic because of his
portrayal of Jewish people,
Wheatcroft would disagree. ““That’s
nonsense... He writes with honesty
and insight. I think one of his great
themes is the painful process that the
Jewish people of his father’s genera-
tion have been going through,”
Wheatcroft said.

Those who criticize Roth,
calling him an anti-Semitic, are na-

said. “They don’t understand the role

of the writer,” he said.

This type of criticism was not
anything new to Roth once he began
to publish his works. Even during
college, Roth endured considerable
criticism for his own satirical style.
A parody of The Bucknellian, which
ran in Et Cetera, the literary maga-
zine Roth edited, shook up what
Wheatcroft described as a more pa-
rochial administration. “For deliver-
ing this gleeful one-two punch to an
innocuous Bucknell institution I was
admonished by the dean of men, Mal
Musser, and brought before the
Board of Publications for censure,”

Roth spoofsThe Bucknellian

During his junior year at
Bucknell (1952), Philip Roth was
elected editor in chief of Et Cetera,
a literary magazine designed to
provide a “sophisticated alterna-
tive” to The Bucknellian. The third
issue of the magazine under his
direction contained a prolonged
spoof of the newspaper and gained
him notoriety as a satirist. Follow-
ing is an excerpt from his autobi-
ography: The Facts.

“Since The Bucknellian ex-
emplified for me and my Et Cetera
friends the lowbrow campus en-
thusiasms by which we felt en-
gulfed, I put asidfe the self-pro-
tective writing postures with which
I had kept my sense of estrange-
ment in check and launched a
heavily sarcastic attack on the ba-
nality of the weekly paper and its
editor...

“There is the theory,’ began
the barrage, ‘that if a thousand
monkeys were chained to a thou-
sand typewriters for an unspecified
number of years, they would have
written all of the great literature
that has been set down in the world
by human beings. If such is the
case, what is holding up production
on The Bucknellian? We do not
expect Miss Roemer [the editor]
and her cohorts to turn out great
literature, for, after all, they are not
monkeys, but we do expect them to
publish a newspaper.’ The
centerfold of the magazine was a
satiric send-up of the newspaper, a

Mal Musser, and brought before the

about the meaning of the word tra-
dition and invoked the “Bucknell

him express himself on these sub-
jects on numerous public occasions,
I came away from that dressing-
down feeling more or less un-

student-faculty Board of Publica-

Roth wrote in The Facts.

The University’s reaction to
Roth “was very much like finding
Philip anti-Semitic. Because he was
making fun of The Bucknellian,
somehow he was trying to under-
mine the University,” said
Wheatcroft.

Martin’s response, when he
turned to her for advice, was to tell
him “that any satirist in America
would be subject to criticism.”

[See “Roth spoofs Bucknell-
ian,” this page.]}

Roth’s playful, witty attitude
did not always get him in trouble.
Once, in order to raise money to fund
Et Cetera, Roth and Peter Tasch ‘54,
managing editor, devised a clever
scheme. “They set up a booth at the
end of the line at which students
registered and paid their fees with a
big sign, ‘Sign up here for Et Cetera;
make your check out to Et Cetera,’”
said Wheatcroft. As freshmen
reached the end of the line, they
simply heeded the sign. “And so all
the freshmen paid their fee for Er
Cetera. And that provided the fund-
ing the magazine needed,” continued
Wheatcroft.

Roth recounts some of his
college days in his autobiography. In
The Facts, he discusses his transfer
to Bucknell from Rutgers Univer-
sity. He talks about being Jewish in
a predominantly WASP community,
about joining the Sigma Alpha Mu
fraternity, and about acting in Cap
and Dagger productions. Some de-
tails, such as his sexual relationship
with “the martini-drinking sophisti-
cate,” Polly Bates, appear, in dis-
guised form, in his novels.

His return to Bucknell in
honor of his former English profes-
sor is bound to conjure up memories
of a time past. As he reads, his words
will, as in most of his stories, reflect
his own experiences. But they will
not concern a time of spritely college
carelessness. Patrimony is a reflec
tion of his own father’s death
Through Patrimony, the true Philip
Roth appears from the shadows of
more than a dozen other novels he
has written. “It’s a more personal
book,” said Martin.

Celebration of the Arts
Weekend begins today

By Laura Grisin
Staff Writer

For this year’s Celebration of
the Arts, the Bucknell Association
for the Arts has planned a weekend
full of entertaining and educational
events.

The celebration begins to-
night with An die Musik, a quintet
of string trio, oboe and piano
against a background of works of
four noted painters, “giving a vi-
sual counterpoint to the music and
offering a fresh perspective on the
interrelationships of art and mu-
sic,” according to William
Boswell, director of cultural
events. The performance begins at
8 p.m. in the Weis Center.

The Cap & Dagger theatre
company will present Dylan Tho-
mas’ Under Milkwood tonight
through Monday at 8 p.m. The
play, directed by Theatre Chair
Robert Gainer, includes a cast of
twenty-four students.

Tomorrow’s events include a
lecture and demonstration on de-
sign for the theatre by F. Elaine
Williams, associate professor of
theatre, at 11 a.m. in the Langone
Center Forum. Williams has de-
signed sets and costumes for many

theatre and dance productions on
campus as well as the scenery for
The Adventures of a Bear Called
Paddington, which toured nation-
ally last year.

The Bucknell Opera Com-
pany, directed by Catherine Payn,
assistant professor of music, will
present scenes from American op-
era at 2:30 in Bucknell Hall. The
program will include works by
Aaron Copland and Leonard
Bernstein, among others.

A reception for the Langone
Center Gallery exhibit, “Divina-
tions—Transcendent Images from
Africa and North and South
America,” will be hosted by the
Association for the Arts at 4:30
p.m. in the Gallery.

The weekend will be high-
lighted by the annual Association
for the Arts banquet which will
include the presentation of the
second Association for the Arts
Scholarship as well as the Acad-
emy of Artistic Achievement
Awards. Tickets for the banquet,
which will be held in the Langone
Center Terrace Room at 5:30 p.m.
on Saturday, can be obtained by
contacting Miranda McGinnis at
524-9726.

Under Milkwood opens in Tustin Theatre

By Bryan Clark

The Department of Theatre
and Dance will present the play Un-
der Milkwood by Dylan Thomas
beginning this evening and continu-
ing through Monday evening at 8
p.m. in Tustin Studio Theatre.

The play, by one of the twen-
tieth century’s greatest lyric poets,
was originally developed for radio.

It has since become a favorite stage
play, providing a poetic and humor-
ous glimpse into the life of a Welsh
town from dawn to dark. Thomas
focuses on the intimate thoughts and
earthy activities of various towns-
people throughout the day, and
threads them together with his lush
prose, verse, and song. Director
Robert Gainer, Department Chair,
adds, “In this play, Dylan Thomas

comically and lovingly parodies the
idiosyncrasies of the Welsh towns-
people.”

This production of Under
Milkwood provides an unusually
high level of opportunity for stu-
dents, with twenty-four actors por-
traying over fifty characters. Assis-
tant Director Penelope Kokines "91
comments on the excitement of
working with such a large cast: “We

have a community environment in
our rehearsals, which leads to a more
enthusiastic ensemble perfor-
mance.”

Students have also found op-
portunities in other areas of produc-
tion. Kokines has led the ensemble
in the development of character
through movement, using tech-
niques she learned from Danna
Frangione and Shellie Cash-Mulley
assistant professors of dance, in tH

ourse “Movement fir
Actors.” Andrew Garman '91, wlo
Btudied “Voice For The Actor” ij a
year-long course in London, has/ed
several voice workshops. Rob Rker
R has conducted rehearsals of a
elsh hymn which will be Der-
formed on stage by the ensepble.
ere will also be two studen/mu-
sicians on stage throughout tht per-
formance. David Welliver Gk will
play violin, and Dan Janusexi ’91
will play flute and keyboard.

Perhaps the most unique as-
pect of this production is tha there
will be no scenery. The setting will
therefore be suggested mrough
lighting, designed by Technical Di-
rector Steven Draheim, and through
costumes, designed by Lirector of
Theatre F, Elaine Williams. This in-
teresting approach to the play pro-
vides an exciting challenge for both
actors and designers. Gaiter remarks
that, “Lighting and coitumes are
combined with the actor,’ talents to
reveal the humanity o a Welsh
town.”

Tickets may be purcaased at
the L.C. Box Office for $3.0. Sun-
day and Monday are student dis-
count nights, with tickets at $250 for
students with Bucknell I.D.

An die Musik to perform in a
display of sight and sound

Tonight’s concert at the Weis Center to feature
paintings and the music that inspired the artists

By Karen M. Ebersold

“The Painter’s Music, the
Musician’s Art,” a unique collabo-
ration between painters and musi-
cians, will be presented by An die
Musik, a quintet of strings, oboe and
piano, tonight at 8 p.m. in the Weis
Center.

The theme of this unique pro-
gram stems from the obvious con-
nection between music and art. In
1981, artist Helen Frankenthaler de-
signed a collage valentine which in-
cluded a ticket stub from an An Die
Musik concert. This valentine be-
came the inspiration for the col-
laboration of the Chamber Music
group, An Die Musik, and four
prominent artists: Helen
Frankenthaler, David Hockney,
Robert Motherwell, and Kenneth
Noland.

The idea was to fuse the
paintings of these artists with the
music that has served to inspire
them. Each artist chose a musical
piece of special significance to their
work, and those pieces will be per-
formed against the slides of the re-
spective paintings, according to
William Boswell, director of cultural
events. Comments’ by the painters,
drawn from informal conversations
about music and its meaning in their
lives, will be included in the concert
programs. The pieces performed will
be: Beethoven’s “Piano Quartet in
E-flat Major, Opus 16,” for
Frankenthaler’s An Die Musik,
Schubert’s “String Trio in B-flat
Major, D.471,” set against
Hockney’s Amaryllis in Vase,
Mozart’s “Quartet for Oboe and
Strings in F major, K.370” for
Noland’s Noon Afloat, and Mozart’s
“Piano Quartet in E-flat minor,
K.493,” set against Motherwell’s
Cantata XIII,

Who the hell is Chris Isaak,
you may be asking yourself right
now. I’ve been asking the same
question for several weeks now
since I first heard the song
“Wicked Game.” You’ve probably
heard it yourself, the eerie broken-
hearted ballad in which the singer
bellows out “I wanna fall in love...
with you.” If that doesn’t ring a
bell, maybe you’ve seen the black
and white video on MTV, with the
guitar strumming singer wearing a
bizarre dark suit. One thing is for
certain, this song sounds like noth-
ing else on mainstream radio, and
that is definitely good.

Isaak’s success, though
seemingly instant, has in fact been
long-awaited. He is no newcomer
to music at age 34, having pro-
duced three albums in the last ten
years. Would you believe his latest
album Heart Shaped World, which
contains the hit “Wicked Game,”
has been available for a year and a
half?

Having enjoyed “Wicked
Game” so much, I decided to pro-
cure a copy of Heart Shaped
World. I was shocked by what I
heard. In a day of dubbing, pyro-
technics, and long screeching gui-
tar solos, Chris Isaak has reverted
completely in the other direction,
Straight back to the traditional,
sensuous love song. It’s a shame
record companies have abandoned

this kind of music for what is gen-
erally flashy trash.

Instrumentally speaking,
Isaak’s music is fairly simple. What
undoubtedly makes him so special is
his voice and his uncanny ability to
combine words into very catchy
lyrics. Strong yet fragile, Isaak sings
the way you wish you could when
you have a broken heart. Another
remarkable trait is the consistency of
his music. His blend of rock, coun-
try, and blues is a little different to
the avid rock fan, but I never felt the

need to fast-forward through a
song on Heart Shaped World.

This is most certainly what I
refer to as “mood music.” In other
words, you don’t put this on to get
the crowd going during a big party.
Rather, you sit down, relax, and
absorb this kind of music. Few
satisfy this mood like Chris Isaak
does. I highly recommend Heart
Shaped World as it will probably
be unlike any other album you
own.

Weis Center cooks up a treat
for the ears with Concordia

By David Murray
Staff Writer

If you mix one part history-
making young conductor, two parts
acclaimed, upbeat, eclectic chamber
orchestra, and one part world-fa-
mous, Tony award-winning vocalist,
what do you get?

You get the Concordia sym-
phony performing with Judy Kaye in
the Weis Center last Saturday night.

Their remarkable perfor-
mance, highlighted by Robert
Christianson’s “Tone Poem for the
New Age,” went a long way toward
the group’s goal of de-mystifying
classical music. “We try to make the
music more ac-
cessible,” said
Marin Alsop, the
ensemble’s artis-
tic director.

As the
concert began,
and Alsop
stepped up to the
microphone po-
sitioned on her
podium, the au-
dience knew that
hers would not
be a traditional
symphony con-
cert. “Many or-
chestras have a
stuffy, museum-
like approach to
symphonic mu-
sic,” she told the
audience. “One
way we try to combat that is to pro-
gram exclusively American music.
American composers always seem
to remember that Americans have a
sense of humor,” said Alsop.

Indeed, Concordia’s all-
American concert featured works by
George Gershwin and Aaron
Copland, as well as the Pennsylva-
nia premiere of Robert
Christianson’s “Tone Poem for the
New Age.”

The concert began with
Gershwin’s “Overture to Oh, Kay!”
Written in 1926, the piece includes
many songs that have become part
of the public consciousness. One of
the songs, “Someone to Watch Over
Me,” was even to be performed later
in the program by soloist Judy Kaye.

The ensemble then performed
a Copland work entitled “Music for
the Theatre.” The piece demon-
strated the talents of the fifty young

musicians who make up Concordia.
The solo clarinet in the Dance and
the haunting piano and winds in the
Interlude were incredibly beautiful
Indeed, the group’s interpretation of
the work was generally delightful.
The final measures performed by
solo oboe left the audience wishing
the piece could go on forever.

That feeling was gone in min-
utes, however, as Alsop introduced
Christianson’s “Tone Poem.”
Christianson himself was perform-
ing with the orchestra, playing a
Korg Tl, an extremely advanced
electronic keyboard programmed
with more than a dozen different
voices. The piece began with his

keyboard producing the sound of
human singing intermingled with
celestial chimes. Slowly, the cellos,
piano, entire string section, and even
an electric bass picked up the theme,
and Christianson started modulating
his keyboard’s voice.

After the work’s thundering
finale, the audience responded with
its heartiest applause of the night.

The second half of the pro-
gram began with the introduction of
Judy Kaye. Ms. Kaye received the
1988 Tony award for her perfor-
mance as Carlotta in The Phantom of
the Opera, and she has appeared on
stage with Rock Hudson, Barry
Bostwick, and John Travolta, among
others.

She first sang “Old American
Songs” by Aaron Copland. Al-
though the orchestra occasionally
overpowered Ms. Kaye’s singing,
the piece in general was very enjoy-

able. Her rendition of ‘I Bought Me
a Cat,’ complete with multiple ani-
mal noises (including a duck’s
“quack” and a cow’s “moo”), was
hilarious! Immediately following ‘I
Bought Me a Cat,’ however, Kay
performed a glorious and touching
version of ‘Simple Gifts.’ As she
finished, the audience momentarily
sat in silence and then applauded
appreciatively

The ensemble’s final pieces
were well-known songs by George
Gershwin, with lyrics by Ira
Gershwin. After the audience had
reminisced to the strains of the clas-
sic ‘Embrace Me, My Sweet Em-
braceable You,’ Kaye began her
best perfor-
mance of the
evening. Fol-
lowing two
verses of ‘I Got
Rhythm,” she
slowly began
to sway and
step in time
with the music.
She then
started to tap
dance on stage,
and the audi-
ence burst into
laughter as she
played a
cowbell, tri-
angle, and
duck call as in-
dicated in the
score. Kaye
even pointed at
conductor Alsop just as the orches-
tra recaptured the theme.

After Kaye’s performance,
the orchestra itself began to ap-
plaud, and Alsop whistled after
Kaye as she left the stage. In an in-
terview after the performance,
Alsop said she appreciated Kaye’s
contribution. “People like Judy
have one foot in both worlds—they
can perform both popular and more
serious works.”

Concordia also attempts to
premiere a work by an American
composer at each of its concerts.
Alsop believes the practice “con-
nects us to living music and gives it
a sense of relevance.” Additionally,
Alsop mentioned that she enjoys
performing at colleges and univer-
sities. “Most of us are only 30 years
old,” she said. “I think we’re closer
to the college students than many
other groups.”

Rules should be written in stone

Athletic Department has much to learn from Howard case

The Athletic Department’s need for a comprehensive policy to govern the actions of stu-

dent athletes and coaches has been highlighted by coach Lori Howard’s recent actions.

According to Rick Hartzell, director of athletics, “If I was going to write a policy for every

single thing that is going to come up, we’d have a book a million pages long; I think that’s
ridiculous.” While Hartzell is correct in stating that it would be impossible to specify every rule

that coaches and players should follow, the need for a set of general written guidelines is over-

whelming.

Howard’s abandonment of four women’s basketball players in Worcester, Massachusetts
was in violation of what Hartzell described as an “understood” policy. In essence, the Athletic

Department has no written policy that would have preempted Howard’s actions and no prescrip-
tion for the punishment of such an action. Howard was forced to make a decision on the spot.
Should she have called Hartzell at the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament is Charlotte, NC to
see how he “understood” the policy? Unwritten policies and understood obligations are simply
not sufficient and can often be misunderstood.

In the Howard incident, the coach served as judge, jury and executioner. A committee
should be formed to handle all student-athlete infractions so that the coach is not all-powerful.

Coaches taking action without review will be in violation of this policy, thus rectifying the prob-

lem without creating a lengthy and cumbersome set of regulations.

‘Reporter rebuts homophobic

To the editor:

I am writing in response to
Margaret Cronin’s February 24th
letter not to rebut her views on my
article on the Lewisburg Peniten-
tiary in the February 15th edition
of The Bucknellian, but to clarify
exactly whose opinions were be-
ing given in the references made
in my story to the presence of
homosexuality and AIDS within
the institution.

To begin, Ms. Cronin’s let-
ter read that the article’s report-
ing made an “intimation that ho-
mosexuality in prison is an ex-
ample of the ‘countless hardships
and loss of basic liberties’ that in-
mates come to ‘gradually ac-
cept.’” Here, it is critical to un-
derstand that it was the opinion of
the inmate that homosexuality
presented a difficulty in his day
to day life, and that the “assump-
tions behind the paragraph,” as
Ms. Cronin wrote, were nothing
more than a paraphrasing of the
man’s beliefs.

While I agree wholeheart-
edly with Ms. Cronin that
homophobia, regardless of who
espouses it, is an intolerable so-
cial bias, I must also implore Ms.
Cronin in this case not to shoot
the messenger. I am a reporter for
The Bucknellian and, accord-
ingly, it is my intention and duty
to report— not editorialize.

As a result of the reporter’s
unspoken pledge to abstain from
inserting any type of bias into his
or her work, I can no more show
support for such instances of

homophobic expression than de-
nounce it in my articles; such activ-
ity, as | am fully aware, is fodder for
this paper’s Opinions section only. I
cannot be certain from Ms. Cronin’s
letter as to whether she had person-
ally viewed the documentary, and
the specific scene to which her com-
plaint referred, but it seemed evident
to me in watching the special that it
was clearly the inmate’s personal
feeling that homosexuality in the
prison presented a type of hardship
for him, as it was alien to his own
ways; as such, I reported on this fact
in my review.

If my wording seemed to sug-
gest an agreement with this
individual’s views, it was only be-
cause of unclear writing, and not the
presence of my personal opinion.

Ms. Cronin’s letter also took
issue with the fact that my article
moved from the subject of homo-
sexuality directly to that of AIDS,
thereby hinting at a direct linkage
between the two subjects. To this, I
say that I made this transition in the
text because the documentary itself
did.

I chose this particular strategy
because I wanted my article to fol-
low the chronological order of the
special as closely as possible— and
a close study of both the article and
documentary will show that I did so
in all other sections of my report
along with the paragraph on homo-
sexuality. Again, I feel that Ms.
Cronin is unjustly assailing the ar-
ticle for merely following the tele-
vision special’s accurate, if not so-
cially redeeming, portrayal of a
prisoner’s opinions.

Furthermore, it must be made
clear that my article suggested that
homosexuality was a major cause of
AIDS-related prisoner deaths in the
penitentiary because it is the only
type of sexual contact which occurs
within its walls— and so, in this spe-
cific instance (and not as in all cases
in society), homosexuality was in-
deed a prime source of the AIDS fa-
talities in the penitentiary, and thus
in essence “an expected fact of life”
for these men, as I put it.

I did not touch upon the pris-
oners’ sharing of I.V. needles as be-
ing just as great a risk factor in the
contraction of AIDS since, again, the
documentary itself did not. To do so,
as Ms. Cronin’s letter suggested |
should have, would have been to
stray from the main directive which
my editor gave me for the article—
namely, to accurately describe the
content of the documentary, and not
to champion a cause. Once more,
that type of journalism is reserved
for the Opinions section.

I would like to impress upon
Ms. Cronin that this response is
merely being written to better clarify
what my intentions were when I
wrote the Lewisburg Penitentiary
article, and not to have “the last
word.” I felt that a response had to
be made since I strongly believe that
her immediate assumption that my
writing reflected innate homophobia
is just as dangerous a phenomena as,
per se, my assuming that a gay indi-
vidual is any less of a man, or a les-
bian individual any less of a woman.

My point being, of course, that
unfounded assumptions concerning
another’s character are just as im-

accusations raised in letter

proper if they are directed to-
ward the heterosexual commu-
nity as they are in being directed
toward the homosexual commu-
nity.

True, the article gave light
to unconscious and unfair as-
sumptions which put down
members of the homosexual
population, but they were given
solely by one of the inmates in
the special; accordingly, I feel
that Ms. Cronin’s letter would
have been better suited if it were
directed to that man himself, or
the producers of the documen-
tary, and not to the conveyor of
that man’s opinion.

If that does not seem to be
a viable alternative to Ms.
Cronin, then I would suggest that
she could have called me per-
sonally in order to either verify
or dispel her assumptions about
my intentions in writing the dis-
puted section of my article.

We must realize that what
we read in the newspaper is not
always going to be pleasing to
our sensibilities. Anyone who
has read media reports of the
atrocities committed toward the
people of Kuwait by occupying
Iraqi soldiers during the Persian
Gulf War, for example, knows
that all too well.

What is of utmost impor-
tance to keep in mind, though, is
that the reporting of an unsettling
issue does not automatically
mean an acceptance or condon-
ing of it by the involved journal-

Student defends
cartoonist’s motives

An open letter to the campus com-
munity:

I was quite disturbed after
reading Janice Butler’s and Amy
Durgan’s letters to the Editor which
appeared in The Bucknellian on
March 8. I felt that they had misin-
terpreted Corey Zayatz’s cartoon
entitled “How our school got its
name.”

As Butler noted, the cartoon
displayed
aman with
his pants
down
handing a
“buck” to a
prostitute
named
Niel.”
Butler dis-
missed the
cartoon as
sexist hu-
mor, but I
believe
that Butler is wrong to suggest that
the artist was attempting to be hu-
morous.

The graphic should be viewed
as satire which does not condone
prostitution nor the
“commoditization” of women.

I believe the artist has brought
up an important point in this car-
toon—the prostituting of this Uni-
versity. For the right price, you can
have your name emblazoned on one
of the campus’ buildings—perhaps
even on the University itself. After
all, that is why the University is re-
ferred to as “Bucknell” instead of
The University at Lewisburg. Wil-

liam Bucknell was very generous to
the University during a period of fi-
nancial difficulty, and as a result, the
University changed its name. The
recent rededication ceremony at the
“Langone Center” is one of many
examples of institutional prostitu-
tion.

I believe the cartoon’s purpose
was to look critically at just what this
University will sell (or has sold) and
at what price. It is analogous to pros-
titution, but
the artist was
condoning
neither prac-
tice.

case, art and
Opinion can
often be inter-
preted differ-
ently. Being
close-minded
about what
type of art or
opinion is acceptable would stifle
diversity of thought and jeopardize
the foundation of a liberal arts edu-
cation.

I, for one, was glad to see
Zayatz’s graphic in the paper, and I
was equally glad to see the responses
to it. I don’t believe we should suc-
cumb to close-minded thinking,
even at the request of the Women’s
Resource Center.

Skena’s
Prescription

By David Skena

My last column addressed
faculty/ student relations on an indi-
vidual level. The goal of this article
is to address the issue more generally
through the governance structures of
those respective bodies. The actions
of “the Faculty” and the efforts of the
Bucknell Student Government must
be called into question if we want to
assess what changes would be help-
ful.

The BSG has shown an inter-
est in Opening ties with the faculty
over the years but has met with only
limited success. Programs that rec-
ognized outstanding faculty such as
the “Faculty Spotlight” program de-
veloped by Grace Rhie under Sam
Williams’ administration have been
tried. Informal receptions for faculty

to talk with the student congress
were tried during my administration.
All of the programs that have been
tried have helped communication be
established for that day at whatever
time but the two governance struc-
tures are very poorly linked. My
recommendations for the BSG are to
are to re-establish and fund pro-
grams that will allow congress and
interested students to talk about
campus issues with faculty. Even
though such programs seem to be
only modestly effective, some com-
munication is better than no com-
munication. Another goal would be
to announce to the faculty the BSG’s
position concerning Pell Grants,
ROTC or other student issues before
any vote is taken.

The main problem with the
faculty is that some of their motions
follow a pattern of disassociation
rather than constructive engage-
ment. Motions that encourage the
University to “abolish” or “sever all
lies” with certain student organiza-
tions cause resentment among most
Students and seem unreasonable.
When confronting a problem that
concerns students, it would be help-
ful to consider reality along with

In the midst of all the debate

agreed upon: that the mistakes of the
United States government which
contributed to Saddam Hussein’s
armed forces and subsequent inva-
sion of Kuwait should never be re-
peated. With this in mind, we ask
the Bucknell community to consider
recent events in the after-math of the
armed conflict: the rebellious up-
risings on the part of Shiite Muslims
and Palestinian factionalists, the
violent response on the part of the
Hussein government, the threat by
the Hussein government of using
chemical weapons on these rebel-
lious forces and the subsequent U.S.
response to renew the military cam-
paign if Hussein follows through

with these threats.

The “War” may be over, but
the fighting is not. Every war is sur-
rounded by significant events lead-
ing up to and away from the actual
fighting. How many of us can forget
how the seeds for World War II were
planted in the aftermath of World
War I? How many more potential
“Hussein’s” are we currently fund-
ing which could lead our children
into war? For these, and many other
important reasons, S.T.O.P. has
continued it’s pro-peace activities
including the circulating of petition
asking for financial support of Per-
sian Gulf veterans, a letter asking for
financial and technical commitments
to cleaning up one of the worst envi-
ronmental catastrophies since hu-
mans have lived on the planet, and
the continuance of the weekly peace-
vigils down by the Lewisburg Post
Office asking people to remember

the effort to speak to that individual
personally in order to discern his or
her intentions. As Ms. Cronin’s let-
ter rightfully asked each of us to give
the homosexual population a fair
chance, so do I ask her to give jour-
Nalists such as myself the benefit of
the doubt.

In closing, though, I would
like to say that it is not my wish to

idealism. Informing oneself of pre-
vailing student views on issues
should be seen as a matter of re-
sponsible voting. The final motion
passed by the faculty concerning
ROTC is an excellent example of the
way these kinds of issues should be
handled. A very similar motion had
been passed by the BSG a day ear-
lier.

The other recommendation I
have for the faculty is to send a rep-
resentative to every BSG meeting.
As president of the BSG I attended
the faculty meetings and informed
Congress of what was going on. Ei-
ther David Ray or an appointee
should make sure that they recipro-
cate and report back to the faculty.
This small step would help inform
the faculty of student perspectives
and current concerns. Finally, I feel
that David Ray and Alex Sherer
should meet at least once a month to
find and address areas of overlap and
disagreement between the faculty
and the students. These actions
would have helped me had I thought
to take them and I feel both the BSG
and the faculty stand to benefit from
increased communication.

Tour guides put best foot forward

By Sue Basalla
Staff Writer

Being a tour guide looks like a
fun and relatively simple way to
make some extra money, at least to
the unsuspecting observer. To the
initiated, however, it is a job requir-
ing preparation and effort, as pro-
spective guides participate in a day
of training and receive a thick Tour

Guide Manual to study. After talk-
ing with some tour guides and
browsing through the manual, how-
ever, itseems that being a tour guide
has many hidden perils.

Tour guides have to be pre-
pared for strange questions and
awkward situations. What does the
quick-thinking tour guide say if the
student asks, “Is this a party school?”
while Mom asks, “Do they serve al-
coholic beverages at those fraternity
houses?” These questions require
extemporaneous thought and smooth
talking. And usually the answer that
the parent wants to hear is not the

answer that the prospective student
is looking for.

According to Colin Bridge-
water "92, a recently retired tour
guide, the question most frequently
asked by parents is, “Are drugs and
alcohol a problem on campus?”
Students, on the other hand, want to
know which residence halls are the
best.

Slightly bizarre questions also

MEDD an eee PAN HEN EMU

challenge the tour guide’s compo-
sure. Paul Kahn ’91 was once asked
by an inquisitive father, while look-
ing at the observatory, if he had ever
taken a date there with a bottle of
champagne.

Along with tricky questions
come sticky situations. Christine
Zapatoky ’91, a veteran tour guide,
described a recent tour disaster: “It’s
really tough finding a freshman
who’s awake on Saturday morning
at 11 a.m. to show a prospective stu-
dent what a dorm looks like,” Chris-
tine explained. “Once I knocked on
a girl’s door and she wasn’t alone

when she opened it. There was a guy
getting dressed in the clothes that he
had worn to formals the night be-
fore!”

Other stressful situations for
tour guides include ones such as Jen
Hunt ‘93 encountered last year.
While she was leading a tour group
out of Vedder Hall, someone hung a
dummy in the window and
screamed, “Don’t come here!” Jen

tried her best to ignore that loud ad-
vice and continue her tour.

ionist, would agreee with Hunt's re-
action. "We’re not jokesters on the
tours, but we try to keep it light,”she
said. If something unexpected hap-
pens, she advises that tour guides
should “gauge the family’s reaction”
and then offer a brief explanation
such as, “They’re kids, that’s col-
lege.”

Unfortunately, the Tour Guide
Manual provides no answers to these
kinds of difficulties. Most of the
manual is devoted to more practical

matters such as appearance and be-
havior.

In the “Do’s and Don’ts of
Touring,” tour guids are reminded to
arrive on time, dress neatly, and
learn trivia about Bucknell. A guide
should never wear a sweatshirt from
another college, smoke, chew gum,
or take any type of refreshment on
the tour with him or her.

The section titled “Suggested

Tour Routes” lists all of Bucknell’s
attractions in outline form. Included
are enough factual tidbits to satisfy
even the most curious visiting par-
ents and students. Tour guides must
be knowledgable about everything
from the number of volumes in the
library to the origin of the couches
in the Weis Center (Pennsylavania
House).

It is impossible to prepare for
some questions, however. Seeing the
senior countdown clock in the
Langone Center, a prospective stu-
dent once asked Bridgewater, “Is
that the temperature?”

“The space shuttle would

explained Nancy Bell, co-

This demonstration of the
almost incomprehensible size of
our planet started off the World
Game sponsored by the Residen-
tial Colleges last Sunday in Davis
Gym. The World Game allowed
students and faculty to diagnose
and develop solutions for the glo-
bal problems of malnutrition, so-
cial oppression, overpopulation,
illiteracy, and pollution.

Union together disarmed a total of
3% of the world’s military capabili-
ties, earning $15 million for each
country. Deciding that curing illit-
eracy was a priority for North

America, Vincent invested a third
of the money in early education
programs for disadvantaged chil-
dren.

Other players were desig-
nated to act as various international
organizations, such as the World
Health Organization and the United
Nations. For example, Japan, as
represented by David Soll °93,
found itself cited by the World
Health Organization because of the
high rate of suicide among Japanese
professionals.

Observing all of these activi-
ties and reporting on them at the
end of each round was Kelly Ann
Gosline ’93 who served as the me-
dia for this microcosm.

The atmosphere of the event
was surprisingly apolitical; in the
struggle to provide for the imagi-
nary population of their nations,
players replaced political goals
with humanitarian ones. As John
Peeler, chairman and professor of
political science and senior fellow
of the International College, com-
mented: “This game demonstrates
that the long-term reality of re-
source allocation is more important
than ideological differences.”

Dialectic Dining

With Steve Hoerter
and Liu Hsiang

Yung Tin Restaurant
Plaza 15 Lewisburg
Eat in or Take out
524-7582

Note: This week, noted pro-
vincial militarist and szechuan
cuisine specialist Liu Hsiang joins
regular columnist Steve Hoerter in
evaluating an area Chinese res-
taurant.

After my abrupt death in
1938 I have had two spiritual occu-
pations. The first has been to read
the Red Book and the Manifesto, in
order to learn the best method by
which to oppose the Koumintang
and to recognize where I failed.
The second has been to critique
American presentations of my na-
tive szechuan cuisine.

Let this visit to Yung Tin
stand as a lesson in the dialectics
of dining. That is to say, at the
concrete and steel autoport on
Route 15 the small has been in-
verted into the large. With perhaps
fourteen tables, the family working
in the kitchen and cheap prices,
Yung Tin would appear to be
small, or as you say, low-budget.
Yet it is precisely this smallness
that allows it to rise above, dialec-
tically, in an ascending spiral.
Yung Tin is on the crest of the ris-
ing historical tide which has swept
aside other institutions such as Pe-
king Gardens.

Diners at the Yung Tin are
greeted with a pot of hot tea and a
dish of chow mein noodles. Steve,
wishing to shatter the notion of the
dialectic, by choosing three flavors
instead of two, sampled the “Three
Flavors” ($7.95)—a delicious
combination of chicken, beef and
shrimp with only the most crisp of
vegetables. The “Three Flavors” is
an example of the szechuan cuisine
in which Yung Tin specializes.
Yung Tin also serves Hunan and
Cantonese cuisine.

ee

I, Liu Hsiang, found Yung
Tin’s cuisine in keeping with the
dialectic. The szechuan Hot and
Spiced Bean Curd ($5.75) was the
higher product of the opposite ten-
dencies of hot spice and cool veg-
etables and bean curd (tofu). In this
dish and the Hot and Sour Soup
($1.45) had beforehand, the heat of
change, of social unrest, of histori-
cal progress was to be tasted. Yet
this spicy, nutritious meal was not
unmitigatedly hot, but tempered
with the vegetative and organic.
The meals, then, were truly a rep-
resentation of progress and the tri-
umph of the dialectic. Sadly,
though, cuisine appears to be the
one thread of szechuan culture that
remains from that fine woven fab-
ric of history. I asked the young
man who took our currency,
knowingly, what Yung Tin meant.
He said, “Who knows?” Ah, these
children of the diaspora, routed by
Chang Kia-shek.

Yet, my comrade and I, rec-
ommend Yung Tin without reser-
vation. These fine meals are but
singular representations of a
greater goodness of cuisine that
they can immediately call on to
please their guests. We recommend
the Sunday Buffet as well, though
the multiplicity of dishes frustrates
the dialectic of which I am so fond.

Farewell,

Liu Hsiang —“Do not mis-
take temptation for opportunity.”

Steve Hoerter—“Heed he
who walks with chicken on his
shoulder.”

Despite the recent intrusion of
inclement weather, the spring sports
season is upon us. Here is a brief
preview of each team:

inagural Patriot League softball title.

fect junior season. Following

BASEBALL

The Bison have stampeded out

of the gate to a 5-1 record, four of §

which have been come-from-behind
victories. The offense, which is led
by tri-captains Roger Ahrens ’91,
Mark Kennedy ’92, and Ted
Obligado 91, hasn’t surprised any-
body with its .303 team batting aver-
age.

The pitching, on the other
hand, has surprised most people. In
their last three games, Bison pitch-
ers have yielded only ten runs in-
cluding a shut-out. Kennedy, start-
ing his third consecutive season be-
hind the plate, will be in charge of
handling the young pitching staff
that includes only one senior.

Bucknell’s left side of the in-
field has changed from last spring.
At shortstop, Bill Rinker ’92 re-
places All-Everything Joe
Markulike ’90, and Larry Trout ’93
takes over at third base. The right
half of the infield returns intact with
Obligado at first and Mike Kearns
*93 and Dave Koerner ’92 platoon-
ing at second.

Centerfielder Ahrens anchors
an otherwise new outfield in which
Steve Gyimesi ’93, Matt Sniegocki
°93, and Jim Zervanos °92 will share
the two remaining positions.

Fordham and Lafayette are the
pre-season favorites in the Patriot
League. However, if Head Coach
Gene Depew, now Bucknell’s all-
time winningest coach, can continue
to get quality performances from his
pitchers, the Bison will pose a threat
to the rest of the league including the
above-mentioned two teams.

Fink *93, and Michelle Kofron
’93. “Nichols is our stalwart, but
the success of Fink’s [who
pitched only one game last sea-
son] pitching will be key” said
Franquet.

Fink, who will also platoon
at catcher and leftfield, set eight
Bison records and was among the
nation’s leaders in stolen bases,
home runs, and batting average.
Another All-East Coast Confer-
ence First-Team selection, Jen

platoon at both of those positions.

Jill Szafranski 93 anchor the cor-
ner.

Centerfielder Karen

veteren who will bat in the middle
of a strong Bucknell line-up.

MEN’S & WOMEN’S
TRACK

Bucknell’s traditionally
strong men’s and women’s track
programs show no signs of drop-
ping off as they make the transi-
tion from the field house to
Christy Mathewson Memorial
Stadium.

The men’s team, which
handily won the inaugural Patriot
League indoor title, is led out-
doors by many of the same people
who led them inside. Norbert
Berenyi ’91, Matt Deardorff ’92,
and Jeff Loomis *92, lead the
dominant distance contingent.

Jim Bock ’92, Marc Lore

Well the weather outside was
frightful, but the sports were so de-
lightful. The winter slate of sports
was full of the thrills of victory as
well as the agonies of defeat. There
were also a lot of crowning accom-
plishments for individuals as several
Bison records were established. As
itall now comes to a close, it is time
to look back:

MEN’S BASKETBALL

The Breakin’ Bison came into
this season with doubts. They had to
replace the leadership and scoring
that was absent due to the loss of
starters Greg Leggett and Mike Jo-
seph, who graduated last season.
They also had to compete in a brand
new conference against such formi-
dable opponents as Fordham and
Holy Cross.

They answered, though, in
triumphant fashion right from the
get-go. They began the season win-
ning seven of their first ten games,
including victories over last year’s
NIT runner-up St. Louis and St.
Francis (Pa.), who received an auto-
matic bid to the NCAA tournament
this season.

The men ran into trouble mid-
way through the season when they
dropped seven of twelve, lowering
their record to 12-10. Included in
this stretch of games was a heart-
break loss at Towson St. by one
point and two conference losses at
home to both Holy Cross and
Fordham, each by two points.

But, sparked by a ten point win
at Holy Cross the men were able to
win six of their last nine before
bowing out to Fordham in the second
round of the Patriot League tourna-
ment with a final record of 18-13.

Bucknell was led by co-cap-
tain Bill Courtney ’91 who was se-
lected to the first team All-Patriot
League. Courtney led the league in
both scoring (20.3 ppg) and free
throw shooting (.795) while estab-
lishing Bucknell records for most
points and free throws made in a
season.

Aiding Courtney was Mike
Bright ’93 who set a Bucknell record
in steals for a season with 65 and Pat
King ’92 who set a Bucknell record
for FG percentage in a season by
shooting .676. Both Bright and King
were named to the Patriot League’s
second team.

The future for the Breakin’
Bison looks bright since four starters
will return, The lone graduating
Starter is co-captain Keith Fenton
91. He will take with him the
Bucknell record for most three-point
shots attempted with 150.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

The best thing the Lady Bison
have to look forward to is a clean
slate. The season was dismal pro-
ducing only two wins in 26 games.
The season’s highlight had to come
when they upset Lafayette at home
61-60 to earn their first victory.
Their second victory came in their
next contest, an 82-71 victory over
Howard. But, the Lady Bison
dropped their last eight games in-
cluding a 28-point defeat to second-
seeded Fordham in the opening
round of the Patriot League tourna-
ment.

The season marred some fine
individual performances over the
course of the season. Julie Bachman
GR was named first team All-Patriot
League for her efforts which in-
cluded 16.4 ppg as well as the best
three-point shooting percentage in
the conference (.448).

Kelly Dee ’94 proved to be a
huge spark for Bucknell. Her 10.7
Ppg and 40% three-point shooting
got her the Patriot League’s Rookie
of the Year.

Next year’s team should im-
prove as they will gain another year
of experience while only losing two
players, Bachman and Caroline
Shantz ’91.

Bridgewater/The Bucknellian
Second-Team All-Patriot League
selection Mike Bright 93 finished
as the Breakin’ Bison’s second
leading scorer

WRESTLING

The Bison entered the season
with great aspirations and a national
ranking of 27. Their path was inter-
rupted by a set of losses in a west
coast road trip against nationally
ranked teams. In fact, five of the
Bison’s eight losses have come at the
hands of nationally ranked teams.

The Bison bounced back
though from their trip to raise their
record to 8-8 before grabbing third
place in the East Coast Wrestling
Association Championships. It was
the grapplers’ worst finish in four
years.

Individually, the season pro-
vided many positives. Three wres-
ulers won their weight c S at the
ECWA Championships and will get
the opportunity to become All-
Americans tomorrow at the Univer-
sity of Iowa.

Mike Van Doren ’92 won the
150 Ibs. division, Tom Marchetti 91
was victorious at 167 Ibs,, and Bryan
Burns ’91 won the 190 Ib. division.
Marchetti and Burns both emerged
victorious for the third straight sea-
son.

Marchetti will depart Bucknell

mo s

as the most successful wrestler in its
history.

MEN’S SWIMMING
AND DIVING

The men’s regular season was
very dismal until they began to come
on as they won their second to last
meet at St. John’s before finishing 1-
10 in the regular season. The Bison
finished third in the Patriot League
Championships and were able to
send four swimmers to the Eastern
Regional Championships. At
Eastems, the contingent of Jay Gross
93, Don Steenson ’92, Chad Farrell
*92, and Kevin Schroth 92 came in
23rd place.

Leaving this season will be co-
captains Rick Hutchinson ’91 and
John Zeigler ’91. Returning will be
all the athletes who competed at
Easterns including Gross, who was
runner-up for outstanding swimmer
at Patriots. Steenson set the Bucknell
pool record in the 100-yard back-
stroke.

WOMEN’S SWIMMING
AND DIVING

The women’s team had a
much better regular season winning
six of ten regular season competi-
tions. They then went on to capture
second place at the Patriot League
Championships led by Margaret
Grunow ’93 who won both the 200-
yard freestyle and the 100-yard
freestyle. She named runner-up
for Outstanding Swimmer of the
Championship.

At Easterns, four women
competed and placed 19th in a field
of 34 teams. Three of the four
women, Grunow, Kathleen Hartnett
“94, and Andrea Falcione ‘92, will
be returning to next year’s team.
Kelly Appler ‘91, who also com-
peted, will be one of the three senior
tri-captains to be graduating. The
other two are Carla Banashek 91,
and Jodi Castalio ’91

INDOOR TRACK AND FIELD

The indoor track season cul-
minated at the Patriot League
Championships at Colgate Univer-
Silty

The men finished first in the
event for the tenth straight year and
look very promising for the outdoor
season. Paul Austin ‘91, Matt
Deardorff ‘92, and Norbert Berenyi
“91 were among several outstanding
performers at Patriots.

The women finished second,
only 18 points behind Fordham.
Seven Lady Bison, including
Lynnette McBride ‘91 and Karen
Shimomura ‘91, set new school
records during the competition and
those individuals should be in good
shape when the season moves out-
side.

Peter Ho/The Bucknellian

Co-captain Caroline Shantz ’91 finished her career fourth on
Bucknell’s all-time assist list. Shantz was also among the Patriot
League’s leaders in steals this past winter.

March 15, 1991

By Mike Markovich

Despite sunny Lewisberg
skies, the Bucknell men’s tennis
team opened its 1991 season last
week with a 7-2 loss to Monmouth
on Friday. Temperatures around 40
degrees prompted the teams to
forego any third sets, opting instead
to play seven-point tiebreakers if the
first two sets were split.

Four of the six singles matches
were decided this way. The three
doubles matches were played in the

pro set format, with a single set to
eight games deciding the victor.
Jerome Charlier *92, playing
at the number one singles spot for the
first time in his career, fell to
Monmouth’s Jon Steffen in straight
sets, 6-4, 6-2. Charlier won the East
Coast Conference Championship at
the number two singles spot the past
two years and moves to number one
following the graduation of Ed Hess
*90, his ex-number-one doubles
partner. Hess was a three-time ECC
champ at number one singles,

Cold, Monmouth set back tennis

boasting a career 63-3 overall
singles record and national ranking
recognition last spring.

The loss of Hess and number
four singles player Dave O’Connor
90 would seem to bode negatively
for the squad this year. But the ad-
ditions of Cris Stenstrém °94 and
Bruno Barbera ’94 to the squad
should help to fill the void. How-
ever, both lost their matches on Fri-
day, with Stenstrém playing number
two and Barbera number three,
playing in their first intercollegiate
matches.

Stenstrém jumped to a quick
6-0 first set victory, but dropped the
second set 6-2 to set up one of the
aforementioned tiebreakers in lieu of
the third set. He fell 7-5 in the
tiebreaker to drop the match.

Barbera also fell in a third set
tiebreaker 7-2 after splitting the first
two sets with his opponent. He went
down in the first set, 6-4, before
battling lack to capture the second
set, 7-6 (7-4).

In other singles action, An-
drew Cantor '92 picked up what
would turn out to be Bucknell’s only
singles victory on the afternoon, at
the number four spot. Cantor, the
1990 ECC champ at number six
singles, rallied from a 7-6 (7-4) first
set loss to capture the second set 6-4.
This forced the third set tiebreaker,
which he won 7-4, claiming the
match. Bucknell dropped the re-
maining two singles matches as
Scott Bank '91, playing at number
five, fell in a third set tiebreaker and
Chris Rimpel '93 fell in straight sets
at number six.

Bank and Rimpel were the
spoilers of a Monmouth doubles
sweep, winning their pro set 8-0, at
number three. Charlier and

Stenstrém fell 8-4 at number one
while the number two duo of
Barbera and Cantor lost 8-3.

The team’s performance last
week could be attributed to the fact
that there was only one week’s
Practice before the opener, the less-
than-ideal tennis conditions, or sim-
ply the overall youth and inexperi-
ence of the team. Only three Bison
players, Charlier, Cantor, and Bank,
have had varsity tennis experience.
Further help will be on hand, how-
ever, as Tim Aitken '94 and Greg
Dowling °94 are expected to add
depth at singles as well as additional
doubles combinations.

The squad travels to Florida
over spring break, where it will play
teams from Aurora University,
Barry University, College of Boca
Raton, Palm Beach Junior College
and Florida Adantic.

Head Coach Craig Reynolds
is looking forward to the actual
match experience and chances for
the men to play outdoors in less hos-
tile weather. He also sees the trip as
a chance to finalize the lineup,
pointing out that it is “wide open
right now, but we’ll be able to see
where we stand when we return
home.”

The team is looking forward to
a fruitful season and some fierce
competition once the season really
gets underway. Despite the loss of
the graduates, Charlier is confident
that the squad won’t lose a step,
saying, “Having proven ourselves as
a dominant force in the northeast in
the past two years with consecutive
ECC Championships, I believe that
our competition might expect us to
rest on our laurels. But closed eyes
will be ripped open.”

One writer’s NCAA Tourney picks

By Kirk Peters
Staff Writer

Once again, it’s time for the
annual rite of Spring known as
March Madness. Across America,
soap opera addicts are being evicted
from TV rooms by basketball junk-
ies and any person even remotely in-
terested in the NCAA tournament
has coughed up hard-earned cash to
prove their basketball insights in the
office pools.

Now that you’ve all heard
Vitale, Valvano, Rafterry, and
Packer express their insights and
opinions on the subject, it’s time you
heard mine. Besides you should
read something during halftime.

First and foremost, there is ab-
solutely no truth to the rumor that

Spring

from page 11

Fordham, which finished sec-
ond to Bucknell for the men’s indoor
title by a mere 88 points, will most
likely apply the same pressure this
spring.

The Lady Bison fell just 18
points shy of the Lady Rams from
Fordham at the indoor champion-
ships.

Karen Shimomuia ’91 and
Tricia Plasko ’92 turned in outstand-
ing performances during the indoor
season in the hurdles and sprints,
respectfully. Kelly Marsh ’91 leads
a deep distance group.

In the field events, the Lady
Bison look strong. Lynnette
McBride ’91 dominated the long
jump this winter. Lynda Rose ’91,
Jen James °93, and Jenny Thomas
*94 are expected to contribute points
in the jumping events as well.

The one area that may prevent
Bucknell’s women from overtaking
Fordham may be the throwing
events. The current roster lists only
one thrower for the entire team.

Bucknell will host both the
men’s and women’s track champi-
onships the weekend of May 3.

UNLV alumni were late in their

Kidding aside, UNLV is a phenom-
enal team; however, they can be
beaten.

If Arizona can get a solid per-
formance out of the backcourt of
Matt Muelbach and Matt Othick,
they have a front line with four fu-
ture NBAers: Chris Mills, Ed
Stokes, Sean Rooks, and Brian Wil-
liams. These two teams should meet
in the West Regional final on March
23. It will be the best game of the
tournament, and I like Arizona in an
upset.

The tournament’s first few
rounds will also provide many
thrills. Some schools should venture

team has two major areas to replace
from last year’s team; putting the
ball in the net, and keeping it out.
Graduated are attackmen Jon Romm
*90, and the Bison’s other two top
scorers, along with goalie Ken
Mangano ’90.

“We need to change our style
since most of our fire power is gone”
said Head Coach Sid Jamieson.

One position in which the Bi-
son are not inexperienced is
midfield. Tri-captain Tom Daveris
91, Garrett Schwartz 91, and Greg
Brown 92 must provide solid play
while the defense and attack gain
experience.

Tri-captain Pat Sheridan ’91
and Andy Linden ’92, along with a
host of recruits, will battle for defen-
sive spots while freshman Colin
Barker will assume the starting
goalie position.

Offensively, tri-captain Matt
Pearce ’91 is one of the few experi-
enced players up front. A healthy
Kevin Roth ’92 will also be looked
to for points.

WOMEN’S LACROSSE

The Lady Bison will look to
their mid-field for strength and lead-
ership. Tri-captain Julie Goeller ’91,

Murray State scares all the big
boys’ coaches and they should make
a run into the Sixteen before falling
to Arkansas. Oklahoma State will
also see the Sweet Sixteen behind
superstar Barry Sanders. Sorry, I
mean Byron Houston, the most un-
der-rated player in the country.

I don’t want all the traditional-
ists to worry; Indiana, North Caro-
lina Ohio State, Duke, and Arkansas
will also join the upstarts in the
Sweet Sixteen.

I also have a pick for the truly
staunch believers in basketball tra-
dition; UCLA will survive the east
region and move on to the final four.
They have some incredible offensive
weapons, and being away from the
California sunshine is just what they

vide just that for Head Coach Jen
Averill.

The defense features tri-cap-
tains Kristina Haas '91 and Lynn
Santilli ’91 who replace two gradu-
ated four-year starters.

Kahra Foster '92 started every
game in goal last season and should
do so again this spring.

Bucknell returns its three at-
tack players from last year’s squad.
Leslie Why ’92, Hilary Thompson
91, and Dorie Ellwood ’92 com-
bined for 28 goals, but, Averill
points out they “must create more
scoring opportunities.”

GOLF

Head Coach Tommy
Thompson’s team is one of the
youngest in the recent history of
Bucknell golf. His captain, Mike
Smigie ’92, isn’t even a senior, yet
he’s the “veteran” of the team.

Three freshman could very
possibly fill out the rest of the top
four slots. Don Hansen ’94, the
Bison's leading scorer in the fall, will
be joined by Doug Dollenberg '94,
and Bob McAleer ’94 a transfer from
teh University of Miami.

Army and Colgate, perennial
east coast powers, along with
Lehigh, are predicted to battle for the

need to stay focused. Ohio State and
Indiana will join UCLA and Arizona
in the final four.

Indiana and Arizona will meet
in the finals on Monday, April 1
Once that young Indiana team gets
to that point, Bobby Knight will give
“Midnight” Lute Olsen a lesson in
college basketball coaching. There
will be hysteria in the Hoosier State
when Calvert Chaney leads his team
to another national championship,
and for at least one day, Indiana’s
players will turn aside the wrath of
Knight.

Finally, I leave you with
something to ponder during your 8-
12 hours of viewing this weekend.
Where’s Fordham?

“We might be a year away, but
we’ ll compete,” said Thompson.

If the freshman can adjust to
the rigors of college golf, the team
could have a bright future.

TENNIS

While most Bucknell Tennis
fans are mourning the loss of #1
singles player Ed Hess ’90 to gradu-
ation, few conference opponents ap-
peared at the wake. Hess’ 63-3
record may take a team effort to
make-up.

Jerome Charlier 92, who won
the East Coast Conference’s number
two singles title last spring, assumes
the head singles position. He’s fol-
lowed by a host of inexperienced
youth. Only Charlier, Andrew Can-
tor ’92, and captain Scott Bank ’91
have seen varsity action.

“The lineup is wide open right
now, but we’ll be able to see where
we stand when we return home
[from a week in Florida],” said Head
Coach Craig Reynolds.

The Patriot League title is also
wide open, but Army and Colgate
are the favorites entering the season.

Athlete of the Week

MARK KENNEDY ’92

Baseball player Mark Kennedy °92 is selected Athlete of the Week
for his performances in Bucknell’s three victories this past week.

The catcher from Franklin, PA went four for ten with four runs
batted in, including a game winning triple with two outs in the bottom of
the seventh inning against Franklin & Marshall

Kennedy, starting his third saeson as the Bison’s number one back-
stop, has also done a tremendous job running a young and improved
pitching staff.

Break up the Bison! The
Bucknell baseball team made it a
perfect week with a thrilling
doubleheader sweep of Franklin &
Marshall on Saturday and a signifi-
cant win over Gettysburg on Tues-
day. The 3-0 win over Gettysburg
was particularly important because
for the first time this year the Bison
combined the three most important
aspects of baseball—pitching, de-
and hitting—in one game.
Let’s start with the pitching.
As reported previously in this col-
umn, unless the pitching shapes up,
it could be a so-so year. However,
on Tuesday, the men on the hill sent
Gettysburg back to the battlefield

fense,

Colin Bridgewater

twisted in knots.

Starter Mike Rizzi ‘91 pitched
seven outstanding innings, giving up
only two singles, while walking
four. He struck out three, all in key
situations with runners on base.

Rizzi attributed much of his
success to the fact that he started his
season early. Throwing seriously off
of a real mound during the month of
January now has him ahead of the
opposing hitters, most of whom
picked up bats for the first time all
winter just a few weeks ago

Part of the blame for the four
walks may go to the cold, blustery
weather associated with early season
baseball (I wonder how a dome
would look behind the Mods - nah
George Jenks would never approve)

Let’s not forget to mention

The Bucknellian

Tri-captain Ted Obligado ’91 fields the throw from fellow tri-captain
Mark Kennedy °92 during the Bison’s doubleheader sweep of
Franklin & Marshall. Obligado tied a Bucknell single-game record
for put-outs in a nine-inning game with 18 against Gettysburg this

past Tuesday.

SPORTS
Bucknell nine surge to 5- lrecord

"The Cardiac Kids" follow-up come-from-behind sweep of F&M with shutout against Gettysburg

Denis Maguire ‘93, who pitched two
outstanding innings, giving up only
one hit (he later picked the man off
first), in picking up his first save.

Another factor in Bucknell’s
first nine-inning shutout since 1985
was the solid defense. According to
Rizzi, his glovemen did a solid job
behind him, helping him out of some
early inning jams.

In particular, third baseman
Larry Trout ‘93 really flashed some
leather, handling seven chances
flawlessly. In addition, first baseman
Ted Obligado ‘91 tied a school
record by recording 18 putouts, evi-
dence of the Bison hurlers effec
tively keeping the ball on the
ground.

Two of Bucknell’s three runs
on Tuesday were thanks to a critical
three base error by Gettysburg
centerfielder Tim Tolve, but the Bi-
son still managed nine hits in the
cold weather. Obligado showed
signs of ending his slump by col-
lecting two hits, as did Mike Kearns
“93 and Matt Sniegocki ‘93.

Among the regulars at this
point, Trout leads the team with a
.435 batting average, while Kearns
(.389), Dave Koerner ‘92 (.385), and
Sniegocki (.308) are all off to good
starts. Add to that the power of Mark
Kennedy ‘92, Roger Ahrens ‘91, and
Obligado, and the offense still looks
potent.

Looking back on what may
have triggered Bucknell’s perfor
let’s go back to
In the first game of the
doubleheader with F&M, the Bison
faithful witnessed another come-
from-behind victory, although this
one was by far the most dramatic.

The Diplomats had built a 6-3

mance on Tuesday,
Saturday

lead off of pitchers Dan Krewson ‘92
and Jack Kazanjian ‘93 when they
turned to reliever Thad Kreshko to
slam the door. As it turned out he
slammed it on his own foot. Mark
Kennedy belted a two-out bases-
loaded triple to cap a four-run rally
in the bottom of the seventh (they
only play seven in doubleheader
games) to give the Bison a 7-6 win.
Roger Ahrens was the star of
the second game, but from an unfa-
miliar vantage point. While Roger
has won many games in the past with
his bat, this time he did it from the
pitcher’s mound. An outfielder his
whole career, Ahrens will be looking
at some time on the hill this year.
On Saturday he notched his
first collegiate win, a complete game

seven-hitter, allowing only two |

earned runs. As Paul Schaeffer
would say, Bucknell pulled that
nutty comeback thing once again,
putting up a six-spot in the fifth in-
ning to tun a 4-3 deficit into a 9-4
win.

Jim Zervanos ‘92 had a two-

run single in the inning, and, thanks §

to Franklin & Marshall’s three errors
in the inning, the Diplomats may as
well have loaded up the buggies and
headed back to Lancaster early. In
all, seven different Bison drove in
runs, with Trout collecting two hits.

Thirteen of their next fifteen
games are at home. So if you’re one
of those people who has thought
about going to a game but never has,
here are a few things to think about:

With last year’s top three
scorers and four-year staring goalie
graduating, the men’s lacrosse
squad was pretty inexperienced en-
tering their first match against
Princeton last Saturday. In fact, the
team features just five seniors
Laden with freshman, the Bison only
have fifteen total players with colle-
giate experience.

Coach Sid Jamieson realizes
the team is young and hopes to make
up for it with a rotating system of
seven attackmen. “This is a more
team-oriented concept rather than
individual talent. They are very to-
gether as a group as far as position is.
concerned, and that’s a real plus,” he
noted. In addition, Jamieson hopes
to make up for inexperience with

good speed and plenty of depth

The key to the attack will fall
on the shoulders of tri-captain Matt
Pearce °91, a three-year letterman
who registered eight goals and three
assists last season. In the midfield,
tri-captain Tom Davis °91, another
three-year letterman tallied nine
goals and six assists last season
Garrett Schwartz ’91 will also be a
force as he scored ten times last
season.

The most important factor is
not the play of the attackmen. “The
key to this season is how well we
play in the midfield. It’s a question
of how much we produce offen-
sively, and how well we come back
and play defensively,” commented
Jamieson.

The defense, though, is the
biggest question mark. The defen-
sive unit will have to replace two

Starters in addition to Ken Mangano
"90, a four-year starting goalie who
graduated as the Bucknell all-time
save leader with 762.

This task will fall on the big
shoulders of Andy Linden °92, who
at 6-4 and 230 pounds has the
physical attributes to compete with
anyone in the Patriot League. The
defense will also feature ti-captain
Pat Sheridan ’91 and a freshman
goalkeeper, either Colin Barker ’94
or Matt Wojnovich ’94.

Barker got the call as the Bi-
son entered its first game of the sea-
son against a Princeton team that
was ranked fifth in the nation in the
pre-season USILA poll. This will be
the two team’s fifth match-up, with
Bucknell’s sole win coming in 1986.
The Tigers won last year’s match-up
13-9 and were coming off an im-
pressive 15-10 victory over a strong

Johns Hopkins team. They were also
coming off their most victorious
season in their school’s history (11-
5) and their first NCAA tournament
appearance.

All their experience showed as
the Tigers thoroughly dominated the
contest from start to finish. They
built up a 9-0 halftime lead en route
toa 17-1 rout. Bucknell’s lone score
came from midfielder Michael
Conway 92 in the third quarter.

Twelve different Tigers
scored. The Tigers outshot the Bi-
son 44-5. Barker had 24 saves in the
loss. The one goal ties the Bucknell
record for the fewest goals scored in
agame. The last time the Bison only
scored one time was April 13, 1974
in a 10-1 loss to Rutgers.

The Bison will hope to bounce
back in its next match, Wednesday
against Georgetown, at home.

All-Blacks demolish
Dickinson in opener

By Mark Spira
and Mitch Benton
Staff Writers

Bucknell’s Men’s Rugby
Team entered the 1990-91 spring
season looking to improve upon
their mediocre fall performance.
Over that season, the squad managed
only two wins and a tie in their six
matches.

To right their ways, the All-
Blacks travelled to Carlisle, Pa., to
challenge the Dickinson College
Red Devils. Bucknell’s chances
were greatly bolstered by the return
of two outstanding veterans, wing
Steve Casey ‘91, playing in his first
game since suffering an ankle injury
in last season’s first match, and out-
side center Andy Meiers ‘91, re-
turning from a semester abroad.

The reuniting of the All-
Blacks backfield proved to be too
much for the overmatched
Dickinson squad, as these two se-
niors each scored twice in leading
Bucknell to a 50-0 romp.

Mark Spina ‘92 led the
scoring, tallying twelve points on the
afternoon, two try’s as well as two
successful conversions of point after
attempts (in rugby, try’s are worth
four while P.A.T.’s count for two).

While the All-Blacks domi-
nated the match in all aspects, they
also had to endure a rash of injuries,
including two to Mike Biglow ‘91
and Greg Dorr ‘93, which forced the
Starters to leave the match. Fortu-
nately for the squad and these play-
ers, none of the injuries proved very
serious and they were able to re-en-
ter the match.

The scoring was opened by
Casey during the first five minutes
of the 40 minute first half, and the
All-Blacks were never really threat-

ened after that. Also scoring in the
first half were Meiers, Dorr, and
first-row Matt Minnich ‘93. Spina’s
first P.A.T. left the score 22-0 at the
half.

While the team has a his-
tory of letting up in the second half
of matches, this was not the case
against Dickinson. Spina scored
twice in the half, while Casey and
Meiers scored their second each.

Also tallying were co-captain
Chip Bousom ‘91 and Howie Fetzer
‘93. The final try was entered by
Tom O’Brien ‘93 and Mitch
Benton’s ‘93 P.A.T. conversion
rounded the final score to 50-0.

Team co-captain and club
president Dave Keim ‘91 was very
happy with the results of the after-
noon. “I thought that everyone
played exceptionally well today.
The pack [forwards] played an out-
standing game, winning the ball
from Dickinson and getting it out to
the backs. The backs played great as
well, especially the guys who scored
twice and O’Brien with his running
the ball and tackling.”

When asked to explain the
lopsided score, Keim cited
Bucknell’s edge in both size and
experience. The All-Blacks will
Play at Lafayette on Saturday, March
16, and will return to play home
matches after Spring Break.

Sojka, trustees respond
to sophomore rush issue

Complaints compel Sojka to meet with nat’l Greek representatives

By Travis Elliott
Staff Writer

An angry President Sojka,
along with members of the board of
trustees and administration, met with
disgruntled Greek national repre-
sentatives on March 19 in Hunt For-
mal to discuss sophomore rush. The
meeting was in response to a letter-
writing campaign recently spon-
sored by fraternity and sorority na-
tionals opposed to the sophomore
rush program, scheduled to begin
next fall.

Lee Idleman, chairman of the
board of trustees, said the letter writ-
ing campaign initiated by the na-
tionals was creating animosity based
on misinformation. He said the let-
ters had “started up debate after it
was beginning to settle down.”

Idleman explained that the de-
cision to switch to sophomore rush
had been made last May, and the
campaign against sophomore rush
was coming in “the eleventh hour,”
just as the program is about to be
implemented.

Noting that many Greek
alumni were threatening to discon-
tinue donating to the University on
the advice of the nationals, Sojka
warned, “You can really hurt a
umiversity’s pocketbook by getting
these letter-writing campaigns go-
ing.”

Sojka explained that he felt

personally attacked by many of the
letters which claimed he had been
two-faced toward the Greek system.
He said, “I think the Greek stance
I’ve taken deserves more respect
than I have received.” Sojka went

we have made our decision, and now
we are hopeful that we can get to-
gether to make the best of the new
system.”

The national representative of
Delta Gamma said, “We came today

“As far as the trustees are concerned, we

have made our decision, and now we are

on to say that he had no hidden
agenda to get rid of the Greek sys-
tem, but he sternly reminded na-
tional representatives that Greek or-
ganizations are guests at Bucknell.

Idleman reminded the national
representatives that the trustees had
overwhelmingly endorsed sopho-
more rush in a 37 to one vote.

Sojka boiled the controversy
down to the question of “who runs
this University.”

“The Board of Trustees decide
what we shall do,” said Sojka, “and
as we speak, Bucknell is in the
middle of a long-range planning
project which will make Bucknell
unique among institutions.”

Trustee Jim Nevels explained,
“As far as the trustees are concerned,

and the first thing we heard was a
reprimand—we did not come here to
be scolded.” She explained that the
representatives were attempting to
fight a national erosion of the Greek
system. She warned that what
Bucknell does will probably also be
implemented by other universities,
noting that “the Bucknell plan” is
now being considered by
Bloomsburg, Colgate, and
Glassboro.

Condoms reappear on Bison
convenience store shelves

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

The Bison convenience store
is again selling condoms after tem-
porarily removing them from its
shelves. Condoms reappeared on the
shelves following the presentation of
a new policy by the Campus Advi-
sory Committee on AIDS and ap-
proval by President Sojka. The
policy, an extension of the policy
passed in 1987, is a response to in-
creased concerns over the availabil-
ity of condoms on campus.

“We had some students who
asked us to put them in the store
when it opened, so we did that origi-
nally, and then we were asked not to
do it because they had not really de-
cided where they should be on cam-
pus,” said Hank Ross, director of
dining services. Ross said that
Preston Hoyle, director of the Stu-
dent Medical Center, requested that
Ross remove the condoms from the
convenience store until the advisory
committee completed its review of
the condom policy.

The increased pressure to
make condoms available is, in part,
linked with a heightened concern
over the spread of sexually trans-
mitted diseases and AIDS. A recent
BSG motion, which urges not only
the sale of condoms in the conve-
nience store but also pushes for the
installation of additional condom
vending machines across campus,
reflects this concern over the spread
of disease.

Selling condoms in the con-
venience store “is an extension of the
old policy,” according to Hoyle. As
part of the initial policy, five condom
vending machines were placed in
residence halls, and the medical
center began selling “safe sex kits,”
which include twelve condoms and
foam.

The change in policy followed
“strong recommendations from
people on the AIDS task force that
condoms be sold in the convenience
store,” said Hoyle. Hoyle also met
with a representative from the com-
pany which supplies the five
condom vending machines to dis-
cuss the possibility of installing
more machines on campus. But the

supplicr, who provides the dispens-
ers free of charge, was hesitant to
install additional machines.

“The machines were not used
as much as they had anticipated; they
were not cost-efficient. [The suppli-
ers] were reluctant, themselves, to
put more machines in,” he said.

University subsidization is not
an immediate alternative, according
to Hoyle. “Before we [go] to the
expense of putting extra machines
around, we ought to expand selling
them in the convenience store,” he
said. The cost of installing and
maintaining each machine would
total $200.

Currently, vending machines
are located in five residence areas:
Vedder, Roberts, Swartz, Bucknell
West, and the Gateways.

The possibility of providing
additional condom vending ma-
chines has not been entirely ruled
out. But the committee will wait
until about November to re-evaluate
the current policy. Hoyle recom-
mends that the AIDS task force
conduct an extensive survey to de-
termine what policy changes stu-

dents still feel are necessary.

Some students have already
proposed changes. BSG passed a
six-part motion, introduced by Brian
Selmeski '92, to provide more
condoms as a way of preventing
sexually transmitted diseases. But
according to Hoyle, who addressed
BSG at its March 20 meeting, “If
you look at their resolution you can
see that some of their things were al-
ready in place.”

sophomore rush, Sojka urged the
representatives to consider “the
broader issue of trying to evolve a
social/residential life at Bucknell
that will serve the institution well.”
He said that sophomore rush would
give freshmen a longer period in
which to become acquainted with
the institution and the various chap-
ters, while hopefully getting seniors
to live in the houses and to take on
leadership roles that would promote
responsibility.

Delta Gamma’s national rep-
resentative expressed concern that
sophomore rush would deny fresh-
men a valuable leadership experi-
ence, and she suggested that fresh-
men would adjust faster and become
better acquainted to Bucknell as a
member of Delta Gamma.

The frest man leadership con-
cern was echoed by Kristine Elliott
’92, president of the Panhellenic
Council.

“T think we at least have to
give sophomore rush a try,” said
Nevels, “I’m disturbed at the sug-
gestion that we should reconsider
our decision at the eleventh hour.”

Federal court strikes down
privacy of security records

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

The debate over the release of
information on campus crime, long
a smoldering issue of contention be-
tween college administrators and
student journalists, has recently been
brought into sharp focus by a recent
court case, an
edict from the
federal Depart-
ment of Educa-
tion, and some

— frustrated stu-
dents who took matters into their
own hands. At issue is which of two
important principles—a student’s
right to privacy and the safety of the
community—should take prece-
dence.

The 1974 Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act, better
known as the Buckley Amendment,
prohibits federal funding to any edu-
cational institution “which has a
policy or practice of releasing, in any
form, any personally identifiable in-
formation contained in personal
school records” without the permis-
sion of the student, while guarantee-
ing students access to examine their
files. The original intent to the law
was to prevent the release of inaccu-
rate information in records, but
many university officials claim that
the law applies to the release of
names in campus police and security
records, and the U.S. Department of
Education has recently jumped into
the fray on their side.

Traci Bauer, editor of the
Southwest Missouri State Southwest
Standard, has brought the issue to
the federal courts in what is expected
to be a test case for this application
of the Buckley Amendment. After
Bauer was denied access to the files.

forward, fall back.”

that the Buckley Amendment
should uot apply to such records
The University had also broken
with its own practice, in which it
had released crime information to
the Standard in the past.

In a separate action, the Uni-
versity sought a gag order to prevent
Bauer from publishing the infor-
mation after she received it from
unofficial sources. University at-
torney John Black claimed that the
release of the names of witnesses
and victims, also contained in the
crime reports, would have a “chill-
ing effect” on the reporting of
crimes to authorities.

This concern was also echoed
by Vince DeCerchio, Bucknell di-
rector of security and safety. Com-
menting on the Bauer decision, he
said, “The requirements of public
safety should not extend to the dis-
closure of the names of victims or
witnesses, but only to the details of
the criminal incidents and the
names of criminal perpetrators. The
public safety need is fully satisfied
by disclosing the details of a crime
or unsafe condition without endan-
gering innocent participants.”

Restrictions tighten

Ironically, the Bauer case has
thus far led to further restrictions on
the release of information. The
Student Press Law Center, a Wash-
ington-based advocacy group as-
sisting Bauer’s case, placed into
evidence a survey showing that fif-
teen universities release such secu-
rity information, indicating that the

schools ascribe to Bauer’s interpre-
tation of the law. Following the re-
lease of the survey, the fifteen insti-
tutions received letters from the
Education Department informing
them that they were in violation of
the Buckley Amendment, and
warning them to stop releasing stu-
dent names. Six institutions heeded
the letter and stopped the practice; at
least four more continue to release
the crime information while they
review the law.

Etta Fielek, an Education De
partment spokesperson, said of the
crackdown, “There is no new policy.
This is just a restatement of the
regulations.” The Press Center
claims to have located nine other
institutions that release the crime
information, but they are refusing to
make these findings public, for fear
of similar Education Department
retribution.

The Education Department’s
interpretation of the Amendment
was dealt a severe blow on March 14
when U.S. District Judge Russell G.
Clark ruled in favor of Bauer,
claiming that the security records
were not protected under the
Buckley Amendment, and that
withholding the information violated
both the first amendment and the
fifth amendment’s due process
clause. In his decision Clark ruled
that the regulations violate the spirit
of the Buckley Amendment, and that
lawmakers had never intended the
provision to cover campus crime.

From page 1

Clark, however, stopped short
of awarding Bauer monetary dam-
ages, awarding the minimum one
dollar rather that the $5,000 she was
seeking Southwest Missouri State
has decided not to appeal the ruling,
but it is a good bet that a similar case
will probably make its way to the
Supreme Court in the near future.

The Department, however, has
not surrendered its fight. Last week
lawyers for the Department filed
motions with the court allowing it to
intervene and block the ruling,
claiming that Clark exceeded his ju-
risdiction by ruling on Education
Department regulations, when the
case should have only evaluated
Missouri state law. Bauer’s attor-
neys plan to fight this new motion.

Mark Goodman, executive di-
rector of the Student Press Law
Center, was quoted in the April 3
issue of The Chronicle of Higher
Education as saying, “The Educa-
tion Department is now a co-con-
spirator in the effort to cover up
campus crime. We’ve got an ad-
ministration that claims to be pro-
education and anti-crime. To take a
step like this shows how hollow their
support for both of these issues is.”

Currently, Bucknell does not
release the names of any students
cited for violations by the Office of
Security or Safety or the Office of
Residential Life. Since the arrival of
DeCerchio last October the Office of
Security and Safety frequently re-
leases copies of initial crime reports
to The Bucknellian, but with all per-
sonal student information blacked
out. John Dunlop, dean of students,
explained the Bucknell policy: “We
will answer questions about inci-
dents, but we don’t want to divulge
information on names... We can
confirm information, short of who it
is.” DeCerchio echoed this policy,

explaining, “We don’t give informa-
tion ona student unless it arises from
another source [such as police
records]. We don’t give out [stu-
dents’} names without [their] per-
mission.”

Brown adds new wrinkle

At Brown University, female
students faced a situation even more
difficult than the Bauer case—cam-

Still only

dents even from investigation. A
group of female students decided to
seek their own justice, writing the
names of the alleged rapists on
bathroom walls on campus. Instead
of being protected, at least one male
student identified felt compelled to
speak out publicly, explaining that
he had been wrongly accused by the
women. The action touched off
heated campus debate, and is caus-
ing Brown to reexamine its sexual
misconduct code.

More than the Southwest
Missouri case, the Brown incident
touches on the heart of the debate,
and the concern of many college
administrators: what special rights
do students deserve in a learning
environment which, in most other
areas, allows students to make mis-
takes and learn from them, and what
is the best way to protect the rights
of all students involved.

Dunlop feels that the Univer-
sity can protect campus safety with-
out releasing student offenders’
names. “If a student is a threat, you
deal with them,” he said. “Identify-
ing them by name campus-wide is a
mistake. Its unintended purpose is
you strip that person of their pri-
vacy.” Dunlop believes such public
attention “seems to be a contradic-
tion with the punishment.” Dunlop
believes that, by publicly exposing a
student as a threat, the University is
showing “we don’t trust him not to
make that mistake again... If you
have a student you believe is a risk,
you get rid of him.” He questioned
“what additional purpose is served”
by attaching a student’s name to a
published crime report.

Dunlop believes there are
“quite a few issues involved” in the
recent debate, but that the largest
problem is that “you’re probably
setting that person up for more pub-
lic awareness in a tiny community”
like Bucknell. “It’s very anonymous
in the real world, but in a small
community of 3,000 students they
are more susceptible to community
and public awareness.” Dunlop feels
this concern is greatest with small
offenses, since “not all sins are equal
sins” and small transgressions may
receive more attention that they de-
serve.

DeCerchio, however, admit-
ted that “I differ with his [Dunlop’s]}
approach on this particular issue.”
While explaining that “I have never
released students’ names in the
past...to protect the student on
campus until they’ve been through
the judicial system,” DeCerchio

e Bucknellian

el

said, “I think they should be pub-
lished [after a student is found
guilty]. If it was legally permissible,
I would say publish the results of
judicial hearings.”

DeCerchio noted several
positive benefits of making the
names and outcomes public, such as
deterring the person from commit-
ting the same crime again, deterring
others by “letting the public know
people are getting caught... letting
people know things are getting
done” (He used DUI convictions as
an example), “alerting people to a
problem that exists,” and “bringing
a problem out in the open, encour-
aging people to report their crimes,”

Of the deterrent argument,
Dunlop said, “That’s the one thing
that might be semi-valid. The only
incentive I can see is an incentive not
to get into trouble again” and to dis-
suade others from similar acts.
However, instead of alarming the
campus and violating the accused’s
right to privacy, Dunlop believes
“we should [get] rid of the student if
its a problem.” He believes the Uni-
versity can handle its internal safety
concerns without the necessity of
publicly exposing the students.

Journalists defend ruling

Frank Gibson, president of the
Society of Professional Journalists,
rejects this privacy argument.
Speaking on the Bauer case, he said,
“This is an important decision and
makes a strong statement that stu-
dents have the same right to know
what is happening in their commn-
nities as other Americans....We
hope it sends a clear signal to col-
lege administrators that the Buckley
Amendment was never intended to
block the flow of information vital
to public safety.”

This assessment was shared by
Travis Elliott °92, editor of The
Bucknellian, who called it “an ex-
cellent idea that the University re-
lease names.” Elliott also went fur-
ther than either Dunlop or
DeCerchio, calling for the names of
students to be published immedi-
ately after they are charged.

He explained that “the press
should be very careful in how it re-
ports criminal charges before [the
students] have been found guilty.”
DeCerchio admitted, “I don’t know
if I can agree with issuing the names
of arrested students,” due to the
stigma which could be falsely at-
tached if the student is later cleared.
Elliott believes the key “is how the
press handles it. The press has a duty
to follow up, especially if the person

discussed. Among them was a sug-
gestion that condoms be sold in
candy vending machines. Hoyle was
not sure how feasible the suggestion
is. “I don’t know whether a candy
machine can accommodate and dis-
pense condoms or not,” he said.

Morgan Woods 93 presented
to BSG the results of a survey she
took last semester. The poll indi-
cated where students thought
condoms ought to be sold. “My per-
sonal feeling is that they should be
available in the bathrooms,” she
said, admitting financial and politi-
cal problems with her suggestion.
Woods’s survey results showed that
51% of the 591 respondents also
would like to see condom machines
in the bathrooms. “I really think
that’s the best way to do it because
on other campuses that’s how I’ve
seen it done,” she said.

Woods also agreed that candy
machines could be used to sell
condoms. “Take out the Three
Musketeers; put in the condoms.
That seems really practical but then
you run into the problem that people

is cleared,” and the two “stories
should should receive somewhat
equal prominence” in the newspa-
per.

Elliott admits that there is
“definitely a risk” in printing such
material incorrectly, both to the ac-
cused student’s reputation and in the
danger of a defamation suit against
the newspaper. He believes, how-
ever, that “most student presses will
be responsible... That’s the whole
point of the press—sticking to the
facts and being responsible in what
they report.”

Other schools change policy

In the wake of the Bauer case
and other challenges by the media,
some universities are moving to re-
classify security information so that
it clearly does not fall under the
Buckley Amendment. In July a
similar lawsuit filed by the Oakland
Post at Oakland University in
Michigan was settled out of court.
As part of the agreement, University
officials agreed to reclassify their
campus security reports as police
records, removing them from
Amendment protection. Michigan
has also passed a law which grants
all campus security forces powers
equal to municipal police forces in
the state. This measure will make it
harder for schools to prevent the re-
lease of crime information, since the
security department would be more
noticeably separated from the
school’s academic mission.

Such a solution, however,
would not work at Bucknell, since
the University clearly has neither the
need nor want of a full-scale campus
police force. Legislation, however,
may be on the way, since there is talk
among some members of Congress
about clearly defining the Buckley
Amendment so that it does not cover
campus crime. A substantial lobby
exists in Washington which would
push for the passage of such a bill.
The same groups were recently suc-
cessful in gaining passage of a fed-
eral law which requires institutions
to publish yearly statistics on cam-
pus crime.

Hopefully for the student press
the pressure of such groups, com-
bined with recent media attention on
the issue, will secure passage of a
revision of the Buckley Amendment,
since it is impossible to know con-
clusively how the new, more con-
servative court will rule on the issue,
with the significant absence of Jus-
tice William Brennan, the staunch-
est advocate of First Amendment
rights on the court.

don’t want to see them,” she said.

Woods is a new member of the
AIDS task force, but unlike others
on the committee, her motives for
increasing the availability of
condoms is not simply prevention of
diseases. “I would rather leave it up
to the health center and the moralists
to figure out why [condoms] should
be there. It’s probably not the most
politically correct attitude as far as
condoms go. On principle of the
matter, I just think that they should
be available to whomever wants
them,” Woods said.

The decision to make
condoms available will not neces-
sarily solve the difficulties pointed
out by proponents of the new policy.
“T’m not sure that having condoms
in every room in every residence hall
is going to solve the problem,” said
Hoyle.

“The problem is basically one
of attitudes that you’re trying to
modify,” he said. Unless students
decide to use condoms, he said, in-
creased availability will be of no
consequence.

Former Women’s Head Basket-
ball Coach Lori Howard, re-
signed from her post on March
18.

By Jamie Diaferia
andDavid Murray
Staff Writers

Head women’s basketball
coach Lori Howard resigned from
her position Monday, March 18
more than two weeks after she re-
fused to allow four of her players to
return to Lewisburg from Worces-
ter, Massachusetts on the team bus.
Athletic Director Rick Hartzell has
formed a committee to find a re-
placement for Howard.

The controversy began on
March 2 when Assistant Coach
Terri Grieb discovered four players
with alcoholic beverages in a hotel
room. After Howard informed the
players that they would not be al-
lowed to ride the team bus, they
were forced to contact the parents of
team member Kristi Dunleavy ’91,
who were vacationing nearby.
Dunleavy’s parents transported the

players back to Bucknell.

Howard’s decision, made “in
poor judgment” according to
Hartzell, placed her at the center of
considerable controversy. In addi-
tion to creating a dangerous liability
situation, the incident raised a series
of questions regarding the school’s
written rules and policies about team
infractions. Several coaches ac-
knowledged the fact that the rules
were not as Clear as they could be.
This, they said, was a result of their
not being written out, but rather
based entirely on a verbal policy.

Howard’s resignation fol-
lowed a meeting between her and
Hartzell on Monday, March 18.
Sources tell The Bucknellian that at
this meeting Hartzell either issued
Howard a list of her options, or de-
livered an ultimatum to quit or be
fired. Hartzell would not comment
on the resignation. Asked if Grieb

would remain as Assistant Coach,
Hartzell said, “She has a contract and
we will honor that.”

Immediately following
Howard’s decision, Hartzell formed
a committee to find a suitable re-
placement. “We are starting the
search for a replacement,” he said.
“A committee has been appointed.
We've had twenty applications and
there are an additional fifteen indi-
viduals that I would like to talk to.”
When asked where the applicants
would be sought, he replied, “Any-

Additionally, Hartzell had said
previously that an in-depth investi-

Philip Roth delivers reading
from latest work, Patrimony

: By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

Author and alumnus Philip
Roth ’58 read last Monday from his
new novel Patrimony: A True Story

: toan audience which overflowed the

pews of Bucknell Hall and included
local television crews, as well as a
mixture of students, townspeople,
staff and faculty. Roth first ad-
dressed the audience directly, de-
scribing his years at Bucknell, and
then presented a chapter from his
novel, in tribute to his former teacher
Mildred Martin, emerita professor of
English.

Following the dramatic pre-
sentation, Roth brought both Profes-
sor Martin and Professor of English
Jack Wheatcroft onto the stage with
him. Amidst loud applause, Martin
expressed her pride for two of her
former students.

Patrimony traces the relation-
ship between 57-year-old Roth and
his 86-year-old dying father during
their last years together. Through-
out his presentation, Roth used facial
expressions, gestures, and a varicty
of voices to help convey the simple
and emotional tone of the story.
“What the hell do I need ’em for?”
Roth bellowed using his strong-
willed father’s Yiddish inflection, as
he described the old man’s stubborn
desire to give back all of his son’s
gifts before his death. “Do asI say,”
Roth asserted in his own voice to the
old man, sounding stern, yet slightly
surprised at his own words.

In addition to his reading,

(Bike thefts

By Travis Elliott
Staff Writer

Six bicycles have been stolen
from various bicycle racks at
Bucknell over the past two wecks
amounting to a total property value
loss of over $2,600. According to
James Middleton, Security Officer,
the number of bicycle thefts have
been “excessive,” despite the fact
that all six of the bikes were re-
ported to have been securely
locked by their owners.

Middleton said, “The offic-
ers in our student security are
making visual checks of the bike
racks more often,” but he did rec-
ommend that students also make
more frequent checks of their

property.

Pregnant?

Roth also visited Professor Harriet
Pollack’s 20th Century American
literature class. Roth had sent ap-
proximately 30 free hardback cop-
ies of Patrimony to the class earlier
and was eager to talk to the students.
He led a frank and informal discus-
sion on the story, asserting that the
book was easy to write but difficult
to handle emotionally.

The author told the class that
half way between the time the brain
tumor was first discovered and his
father’s death, he decided to write
the story. Roth’s stories are known
for their autobiographical flavor, but
he informed the class that Patri-
mony is the first novel in which the
main character thoroughly repre-
sents himself. One member of the
class described Roth’s presentation
as sincere and personable.

Roth also answered a variety
of questions about other aspects of
his life. Responding to inquiries
about his Bucknell experience, Roth
asserted that Bucknell “was very
nice, and sometimes it was so nice it
made you sick.” When asked if be-
ing Jewish had any effect on his
Bucknell experience Roth stated
that he encountered no prejudice
during his years on campus.

Roth also revealed to the class
that he had given permission for
Patrimony to be turned into a televi-
sion movie. He admitted that he had
his doubts about the integrity of a
television adaptation, but eventually
determined that his enterprising dad
would have been all for it.

increase

The Office of Security and
Safety provides free bicycle regis-
tration, and according to
Middleton, the office will be con-
ducting a registration drive in the
Langone Center in the near future.

Middleton noted that the
Krypton or Cytadel horseshoe-
shaped locks provide the most ef-
fective defense against theft, al-
though two of the bicycles stolen
had been secured by those types of
locks.

Of the six bicycles stolen,
four were mountain bikes and two
were racing bicycles, all of which
had been valued at over $300.
Middleton asked that any students
witnessing suspicious activities
call the Office of Security and
Safety immediately.

The Bucknell Student Government recently passed a resolution
which recommends requiring dog owners to keep their pets on a

leash at all times.

strictly enforcing the University’s
pet leash law.

BSG member Sandi Green
*93 proposed the motion, stating
that she was motivated by the “po-
tential threat dogs pose to members
of the Bucknell community.” The
resolution also adheres to the safety
concern for those students who
have a fear of dogs.

Green first recommended
that BSG develop a plan to handle
the dogs that roam the campus.
After further discussion, a BSG
member stated that the University
has a leash policy which all com-
munity members must follow. The
resolution was then changed to
foster stricter enforcement.

Security’s policy states that if

a threat to the children in the day
care area nearby. “I would hate to
be reactive instead of proactive,
and wait for something to happen
to one of those kids before we do
something,” said Green.

Nicole Yates ’93, who sug-
gested that Green raise the issue
during a BSG session, stated, “I’m
sick and tired of seeing dogs run
around without leashes.” Yates ex-
pressed the concern that despite the
policy of no dogs allowed indoors.
like the Langone Center, dogs en-

safety threat. Yates concluded, “I
don’t like them, I’m afraid of them,
and I think that their owners should
be forced to keep them on a leash.”

Iraq suppresses
rebellion

The Iraqi Army appeared
Wednesday to have suppressed a
month long civil war in Iraq. Presi-
dent Saddam Hussein’s Government
in Baghdad had been challenged by
rebellions ever since Iraqi troops
were driven from Kuwait last month
by American-led forces.

These rebellions were led by
Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq and
by Kurdish guerrillas in the north.
The decrease of fighting in the south
and the retreat of Kurdish rebels into
the mountainous border with Turkey
and Iran have led to the conclusion
of the rebellion’s suppression. In
addition, Government troops have
recaptured the major Iraqi cities.

The Security Council has
made progress in setting terms for a
permanent cease-fire in the Persian
Gulf war. The Bush administration
maintains, however, that it has not
changed its position concerning its
refusal to commit American troops
or military aid to the uprising. As of
now, Outside force will not be used
to overthrow the Hussein Govern-
ment which, as it appears, have
consolidated their hold on power.

Soviets face
price increases

Soviet citizens endured the
first day of steep consumer price in-
crease Tuesday. Even though extra
goods were expected in stores, Sovi-
ets stood in long lines for scarce, not
to mention shabby, goods. Many
stores around Moscow were actually
closed, bearing signs that read “No
Goods.” In stores where consumers
could wait in line for goods, they
found prices had doubled, tripled,
and sometimes quadrupled the lev-
els on Monday.

Even though the price changes
were announced last month, many
store directors met with great confu-
sion and frustration because Gov-
emment Officials had failed to give
them complete lists of the new
prices. Many, therefore, opened their
stores guessing what they were sup-
posed to charge for items.

As partial compensation for
the price increases, the Government
said that it would raise pay. It also
was expected, however, to stock
stores with abundant goods, but
consumers did not witness this
Tuesday. At first it was said that the

price increases would be used to
stimulate production and cut the
budget deficit, but now the Govemn-
ment says that 85 percent of the in-
come will actually be used to pay
compensation to workers.

Three protesters

Three anti-Communist dem-

Drug agents
seize 3 frats

According to the Philadelphia
Inquirer, Federal drug agents seized
three University of Virginia frater-
nity houses in a raid on March 23.
Three students were arrested on
charges of drug distribution and nine
others were being sought on the
same charges. The 12 students, ages
19 to 23, were involved in multiple
sales of small amounts of illegal
drugs to undercover officers.

The three fraternities which
were raided included Delta Upsilon,
Phi Epsilon, and Tau Kappa Epsilon.
Items taken during the raid consisted
of marijuana, hallucinogenic mush-
rooms, LSD tablets, scales, a mari-
juana growing system, and scores of
pipes for smoking marijuana. The
task force had been investigating
drug traffic on campus since August,
and this is the first such case in
which fraternity houses were taken
under federal control.

smashed many of the windows of
Shkoder’s Communist Party head-
quarters. Members of the crowd
publicly denounced the Communist
Party as well as Albania’s President
Ramiz Alia.

Shkoder, a city of about
72,000, voted strongly in the elec-
tions for the three-month-old oppo-
sition Democratic Party. The sit-
down strike in front of the Commu-
nist headquarters occurred when
anti-Communists heard that a lead-
ing member of the Communist Party
Politburo had said at a nationally
televised news conference that his
party remained Albania’s dominant
political force and that Albania
would continue to be ruled by Marx-
ist-Leninist policies. The firing be-
gan after Albania’s Army told dem-
Onstrators to leave the square and
they remained.

End of recession
questioned

The current recession seems to
have started last August when the
Persian Gulf crisis disturbed Ameri-
cans’ outlook concerning business
and jobs. With the successful end to
the war in the Gulf, however, the
possibility of a prompt economic
recovery is being questioned.

When Americans’ confidence
fell to its lowest level in a decade
between August and October, con-
sumers reacted by cutting back
sharply on big investment purchases,
like cars and appliances. Businesses
responded also by cutting invento-
ries and laying off workers.

There have been many recent
signs which promise economic re-
covery. Business executives are op-
timistic about future sales, but more

The nuclear reactor being de-

This nuclear-powered rocket

Doctors refuse
Medicaid users

Forty-four states have had
problems getting doctors to partici-
pate in Medicaid, the health program
for poor people. The reason for this
is that Medicaid pays doctors much
less than either Medicare or private
health insurers for the same service.
As a result, many doctors are refus-
ing to take Medicaid patients.

Medicaid is the Federal-state
program for 27 million low-income
Americans, including 13 million
children, It has been discovered that
Medicaid pays doctors only about 69
percent of what Medicare, the Fed-
eral health insurance program for 33
million elderly and disabled people,
pays and an even smaller proportion
of what private insurers pay.

One reason for this comes
from the way the programs are fi-
nanced. As opposed to Medicare
which has its own federally con-
trolled trust funds, Medicaid de-
pends almost entirely on general
federal and state revenues. States can
pretty much decide on their own how
much to pay in doctors’ fees under
Medicaid, allowing state Medicaid
agencies to sct the fees. Since these
agencies often fail to update doctors’
fees to account for inflation, Medic-
aid sometimes ends up paying less
than it costs doctors to perform cer-
tain services.

Former accountant finds that
rare book collecting adds up

By Sue Basalla
Staff Writer

If on graduation day in 1958
someone had told David Block that
he would fill an order for President
George Bush in 1989, the Com-
merce and Finance major would
never have guessed that he would be
supplying the president with a rare
book. But the former accountant
turned rare book dealer did just that,
locating an 1872 edition of William
Cullen Bryant’s “Picturesque
America” as a gift for President
Gorbachev at the December summit
in Malta.

Although his college study
prepared him to become an accoun-
tant in his family’s firm, in 1979
Block opened “The Book Block,” an
antiquarian bookselling business in
Cos Cob, Connecticut. His wife,
Shiu Min, an expert bookbinder and
restorer, works next door to her hus-
band in the office built onto their
home.

As a merchant, Block’s credo
is “Never the commonplace.” Find-
ing that the thrill of acquiring each
book diminished as he discovered
his second and third copies of a par-
ticular work, Block “began to seek
out the more esoteric and out-of-the-
way items,” taking the chance that

customers might not share his inter-
est in them. The risk of buying ob-
scure books, however, contributed to
the thrill of selling it to a pleased
customer.

Speaking from Connecticut
last week, Block explained that he

1854, the manuscript documents
Lincoln’s arguments against the in-
stitution of slavery. [see box below]
Having purchased the Lincoln
manuscript at a Sotheby’s auction
for $82,500 in 1987, Block resold it
for $150,00 in 1989.

Abraham Lincoln’s notes on slavery

If A. can prove, however conclusively, that he may, of right,
enslave B., why may not B. snatch the same argument, and prove

equally, that he may enslave A.?

You say A. is white, and B. is black. It is color, then; the lighter,
having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule, you are
to be slave to the first man you meet, with a fairer skin than your own.

You do not mean color exactly? You mean the whites are intel-
lectually the superiors of the blacks; and therefore have the right to
enslave them? Take care again. By this rule, you are to be slave to the
first man you meet, with an intellect superior to your own.

But, say you, it is a question of interest; and, if you can make it
your interest, you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if
he can make it his interest, he has the right to enslave you.

“likes the book as a physical object.
There must be something about the
paper, type, printing, illustrations,
binding, format, some physically at-
tractive attribute that speaks to me.”

One of Block’s most treasured
items, a manuscript by Abraham
Lincoln, was probably chosen for its
historical importance rather than for
its physical qualities. Written circa

Scarlet D Tavern
264 Chestnut St.
Mifflinburg, PA
966-3003

By Steve Hoerter
and Julie Bachman
Staff Writers

Lacking the gumption to
drive the 45 minutes to discover the
next hot bed of culinary delight,
Julie and Steve instead decided to
re-evaluate the long-time
Mifflinburg favorite, Scarlet D
Tavern.

Located mere yards before
the first stop light on Route 45 in
Mifflinburg, the Scarlet D_ pro-
vides a relaxed homey atmosphere
for a satisfying dinner out on the
town.The menu boasts a wide array
of seafood, beef and poultry dishes,
tantalizing appetizers and luscious
desserts.

Julie feasted upon the broiled
chicken breast ($6.50), baked po-
tato and tossed salad. For an appe-
tizer, she sampled the shrimp
cocktail ($6.00).

Julie found the shrimp to
have that “fresh out of the ocean”
flavor. The chicken was tender and
juicy, but Julie discovered the po-
tato to be just a bit too much to
handle. The salad was hearty and
provided just enough roughage for

Steve, feeling wealthy and
wanting to show off for the wait-
ress, ordered the surf and turf
($26.50). He found the 10 oz.
lobster tail to be a tasty seafood
treat. The 6 oz. steak, however,
was a bit too mealy for Steve’s
taste — and almost overshad-
owed the tastiness of the lobster
tail. In addition to the Surf and
Turf, Steve had a tossed salad and
baked potato, which he found to
be quite satisfactory.

Julie and Steve recommend
the Scarlet D Tavern with only
one minor reservation — watch
out for that cut of beef! The menu
is diverse and the prices are, on
the whole, very reasonable. (They
also have possession of a coveted
liquor license — the bar looks
like a definite weekend possibil-
ity). D’s is open for breakfast,
lunch and, of course, dinner.
Check it out!

Although such financial suc-
cess is vital for his business, Block
derives greater satisfaction from
“finding a book a good home, where
it will be well-read.”

Referring to the recent sale of
a Honus Wagner baseball card for
$450,000, Block said that the outra-
geous price “showed the foolishness
to which collecting has come... Un-
like a book, a baseball card has no
social or intellectual value. The price
is indecently high and the only moti-
vation is the future appreciation as
an investment.”

Although Block has changed
his priorities since his accountant
days, his affection for books dates
back to his sophomore year at Buck-
nell. Block credits Dr. Ralph Rees,
emeritus professor of English, with
developing his interest in literature.

In 1960, after abandoning his
accounting career, Block spent a
year in Europe exploring classic art
and literature. The experience, he
said, “convinced me that I wanted to
make my life in the world of books
and letters.” After earning his
master's degree at New York Uni-
versity, Block taught for a year at
Paddington Technical College in
London and then at Kingman Walt
Whitman College in New York.

Block heard of the teaching
position at Kingman from a gradu-
ate school friend, Shiu Min, then art
director and assistant principal of
Kingman. Married a year later,
Block and Shiu Min began collect-
ing artwork. As they began to run out
of wallspace, however, the Blocks
began collecting illustrated books
instead. This hobby, over the next
decade, gradually developed into
their antiquarian bookstore, “The

Book Block.”

After their first few years of
business, the Blocks decided to close
the store and sell books only through
mail-order catalogs. “I’m not a mis-
anthrope,” Block explained, “I pre-
fer mailing out the catalogues and
giving everyone a fair chance to buy
what we have to offer.”

lraq suppresses
rebellion

The Iraqi Army appeared
Wednesday to have suppressed a
month long civil war in Iraq. Presi-
dent Saddam Hussein’s Government
in Baghdad had been challenged by
rebellions ever since Iraqi troops
were driven from Kuwait last month
by American-led forces.

These rebellions were led by
Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq and
by Kurdish guerrillas in the north.
The decrease of fighting in the south
and the retreat of Kurdish rebels into
the mountainous border with Turkey
and Iran have led to the conclusion
of the rebellion’s suppression. In
addition, Government troops have
recaptured the major Iraqi cities.

The Security Council has
made progress in setting terms for a
permanent cease-fire in the Persian
Gulf war. The Bush administration
maintains, however, that it has not
changed its position concerning its
refusal to commit American troops
or military aid to the uprising. As of
now, outside force will not be used
to overthrow the Hussein Govern-
ment which, as it appears, have
consolidated their hold on power.

Soviets face
price increases

Soviet citizens endured the
first day of steep consumer price in-
crease Tuesday. Even though extra
goods were expected in stores, Sovi-
ets stood in long lines for scarce, not
to mention shabby, goods. Many
stores around Moscow were actually
closed, bearing signs that read “No
Goods.” In stores where consumers
could wait in line for goods, they
found prices had doubled, tripled,
and sometimes quadrupled the lev-
els on Monday.

Even though the price changes
were announced last month, many
store directors met with great confu-
sion and frustration because Gov-
emment officials had failed to give
them complete lists of the new
prices. Many, therefore, opened their
stores guessing what they were sup-
posed to charge for items.

As partial compensation for
the price increases, the Government
said that it would raise pay. It also
was expected, however, to stock
stores with abundant goods, but
consumers did not witness this
Tuesday. At first it was said that the

price increases would be used to
stimulate production and cut the
budget deficit, but now the Govern-
ment says that 85 percent of the in-
come will actually be used to pay
compensation to workers.

Three protesters
killed in Albania

Three anti-Communist dem-
onstrators in Albania were killed and
30 others wounded when the Alba-
nian Army fired at the group of
demonstrators Tuesday with rifles
and a 20-millimeter cannon. The
group was protesting the election of
the Communist Party to power by
sitting in the main square of the
northern Albanian city of Shkoder.

The protestors, enraged by the

Drug agents
seize 3 frats

According to the Philadelphia
Inquirer, Federal drug agents seized
three University of Virginia frater-
nity houses in a raid on March 23.
Three students were arrested on
charges of drug distribution and nine
others were being sought on the
same charges. The 12 students, ages
19 to 23, were involved in multiple
sales of small amounts of illegal
drugs to undercover officers.

The three fraternities which
were raided included Delta Upsilon,
Phi Epsilon, and Tau Kappa Epsilon.
Items taken during the raid consisted
of marijuana, hallucinogenic mush-
rooms, LSD tablets, scales, a mari-
juana growing system, and scores of
pipes for smoking marijuana. The
task force had been investigating
drug traffic on campus since August,
and this is the first such case in
which fraternity houses were taken
under federal control.

killings, set fire to two nearly ar-
mored personnel carriers and
smashed many of the windows of
Shkoder’s Communist Party head-
quarters. Members of the crowd
publicly denounced the Communist
Party as well as Albania’s President
Ramiz Alia.

Shkoder, a city of about
72,000, voted strongly in the elec-
tions for the three-month-old oppo-
sition Democratic Party. The sit-
down strike in front of the Commu-
nist headquarters occurred when
anti-Communists heard that a lead-
ing member of the Communist Party
Politburo had said at a nationally
televised news conference that his
party remained Albania’s dominant
political force and that Albania
would continue to be ruled by Marx-
ist-Leninist policies. The firing be-
gan after Albania’s Army told dem-
onstrators to leave the square and
they remained.

End of recession
questioned

The current recession seems to
have started last August when the
Persian Gulf crisis disturbed Ameri-
cans’ outlook concerning business
and jobs. With the successful end to
the war in the Gulf, however, the
possibility of a prompt economic
recovery is being questioned.

When Americans’ confidence
fell to its lowest level in a decade
between August and October, con-
sumers reacted by cutting back
sharply on big investment purchases,
like cars and appliances. Businesses
responded also by cutting invento-
ries and laying off workers.

There have been many recent
signs which promise economic re-
covery. Business executives are op-
timistic about future sales, but more

The nuclear reactor being de-
veloped would power engines much
more energetic than the rockets be-
ing used now. It is predicted that the
nuclear rocket would be able to lift
payloads of about 70 tons into a low
orbit of the earth. Such large weap-
ons that would be launched could
include massive lasers, particle
beams, and homing rockets.

This nuclear-powered rocket
would contain a true reactor that
splits atoms and attains the high
temperature of more than 3,000 de-
grees Fahrenheit. This program was

Doctors refuse
Medicaid users

Forty-four states have had
problems getting doctors to partici-
pate in Medicaid, the health program
for poor people. The reason for this
is that Medicaid pays doctors much
less than either Medicare or private
health insurers for the same service.
As a result, many doctors are refus-
ing to take Medicaid patients.

Medicaid is the Federal-state
program for 27 million low-income
Americans, including 13 million
children, It has been discovered that
Medicaid pays doctors only about 69
percent of what Medicare, the Fed-
eral health insurance program for 33
million elderly and disabled people,
pays and an even smaller proportion
of what private insurers pay.

One reason for this comes
from the way the programs are fi-
nanced. As opposed to Medicare
which has its own federally con-
trolled trust funds, Medicaid de-
pends almost entirely on general
federal and state revenues. States can
pretty much decide on their own how
much to pay in doctors’ fees under
Medicaid, allowing state Medicaid
agencies to set the fees. Since these
agencies often fail to update doctors’
fees to account for inflation, Medic-
aid sometimes ends up paying less
than it costs doctors to perform cer:
tain services.

Former accountant finds that
rare book collecting adds up

By Sue Basalla
Staff Writer

If on graduation day in 1958
someone had told David Block that
he would fill an order for President
George Bush in 1989, the Com-
merce and Finance major would
never have guessed that he would be
supplying the president with a rare
book. But the former accountant
turned rare book dealer did just that,
locating an 1872 edition of William
Cullen Bryant’s “Picturesque
America” as a gift for President
Gorbachev at the December summit
in Malta.

Although his college study
prepared him to become an accoun-
tant in his family’s firm, in 1979
Block opened “The Book Block,” an
antiquarian bookselling business in
Cos Cob, Connecticut. His wife,
Shiu Min, an expert bookbinder and
restorer, works next door to her hus-
band in the office built onto their
home.

As a merchant, Block’s credo
is “Never the commonplace.” Find-
ing that the thrill of acquiring each
book diminished as he discovered
his second and third copies of a par-
ticular work, Block “began to seek
out the more esoteric and out-of-the-
way items,” taking the chance that

customers might not share his inter-
est in them. The risk of buying ob-
scure books, however, contributed to
the thrill of selling it to a pleased
customer.

Speaking from Connecticut
last week, Block explained that he

1854, the manuscript documents
Lincoln’s arguments against the in-
stitution of slavery. [see box below]
Having purchased the Lincoln
manuscript at a Sotheby’s auction
for $82,500 in 1987, Block resold it
for $150,00 in 1989.

Abraham Lincoln’s notes on slavery

If A. can prove, however conclusively, that he may, of right,
enslave B., why may not B. snatch the same argument, and prove

equally, that he may enslave A.?

You say A. is white, and B. is black. It is color, then; the lighter,
having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule, you are
to be slave to the first man you meet, with a fairer skin than your own.

You do not mean color exactly? You mean the whites are intel-
lectually the superiors of the blacks; and therefore have the right to
enslave them? Take care again. By this rule, you are to be slave to the
first man you meet, with an intellect superior to your own.

But, say you, it is a question of interest; and, if you can make it
your interest, you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if
he can make it his interest, he has the right to enslave you.

“likes the book as a physical object.
There must be something about the
paper, type, printing, illustrations,
binding, format, some physically at-
tractive attribute that speaks to me.”

One of Block’s most treasured
items, a manuscript by Abraham
Lincoln, was probably chosen for its
historical importance rather than for
its physical qualities. Written circa

Wine, dine and well...never mind

Scarlet D Tavern
264 Chestnut St.
Mifflinburg, PA
966-3003

By Steve Hoerter
and Julie Bachman
Staff Writers

Lacking the gumption to
drive the 45 minutes to discover the
next hot bed of culinary delight,
Julie and Steve instead decided to
re-evaluate the long-time
Mifflinburg favorite, Scarlet D
Tavern.

Located mere yards before
the first stop light on Route 45 in
Mifflinburg, the Scarlet D_ pro-
vides a relaxed homey atmosphere
for a satisfying dinner out on the
town.The menu boasts a wide array
of seafood, beef and poultry dishes,
tantalizing appetizers and luscious
desserts.

Julie feasted upon the broiled
chicken breast ($6.50), baked po-
tato and tossed salad. For an appe-
tizer, she sampled the shrimp
cocktail ($6.00).

Julie found the shrimp to
have that “fresh out of the ocean”
flavor. The chicken was tender and
juicy, but Julie discovered the po-
tato to be just a bit too much to
handle. The salad was hearty and
provided just enough roughage for

Steve, feeling wealthy and
wanting to show off for the wait-
ress, ordered the surf and turf
($26.50). He found the 10 oz.
lobster tail to be a tasty seafood
treat. The 6 oz. steak, however,
was a bit too mealy for Steve’s
taste — and almost overshad-
owed the tastiness of the lobster
tail. In addition to the Surf and
Turf, Steve had a tossed salad and
baked potato, which he found to
be quite satisfactory.

Julie and Steve recommend
the Scarlet D Tavern with only
one minor reservation — watch
out for that cut of beef! The menu
is diverse and the prices are, on
the whole, very reasonable. (They
also have possession of a coveted
liquor license — the bar looks
like a definite weekend possibil-
ity). D’s is open for breakfast,
lunch and, of course, dinner.
Check it out!

regularity. ~— ~} . ss

Although such financial suc-
cess is vital for his business, Block
derives greater satisfaction from
“finding a book a good home, where
it will be well-read.”

Referring to the recent sale of
a Honus Wagner baseball card for
$450,000, Block said that the outra-
geous price “showed the foolishness
to which collecting has come... Un-
like a book, a baseball card has no
social or intellectual value. The price
is indecently high and the only moti-
vation is the future appreciation as
an investment.”

Although Block has changed
his priorities since his accountant
days, his affection for books dates
back to his sophomore year at Buck-
nell. Block credits Dr. Ralph Rees,
emeritus professor of English, with
developing his interest in literature.

In 1960, after abandoning his
accounting career, Block spent a
year in Europe exploring classic art
and literature. The experience, he
said, “convinced me that I wanted to
make my life in the world of books
and letters.” After earning his
master's degree at New York Uni-
versity, Block taught for a year at
Paddington Technical College in
London and then at Kingman Walt
Whitman College in New York.

Block heard of the teaching
position at Kingman from a gradu-
ate school friend, Shiu Min, then art
director and assistant principal of
Kingman. Married a year later,
Block and Shiu Min began collect-
ing artwork. As they began to run out
of wallspace, however, the Blocks
began collecting illustrated books
instead. This hobby, over the next
decade, gradually developed into
their antiquarian bookstore, “The
Book Block.”

After their first few years of
business, the Blocks decided to close
the store and sell books only through

mail-order catalogs. “I’m not a mis-
anthrope,” Block explained, “I pre-
fer mailing out the catalogues and
giving everyone a fair chance to buy
what we have to offer.”

own rare book business. Block will give the LaFayette Butler Lecture
Thursday, April 11 at 8 p.m. in the Traditional Reading Room of the

Another change in the busi-

bindery. Frustrated at the length of
time he had to wait for books to be
bound, Block suggested that Shiu
Min apply her artistic skills to the
rare and difficult art of bookbinding.
Since then, she has become a pre-

The Bucknellian

Q: Is sophomore rush in the
best interest of Bucknell?
A: It just doesn’t matter!

The question is moot, and has been for nearly a year. President Sojka made his recommen-
dations for changes to the Greek system on May 1, 1990, but many fraternity and sorority na-

tional corporations have still failed to accept the finality of Bucknell’s sophomore rush decision.

The letter writing campaign begun recently by the nationals will do little more than re-
inflame the wounds that had just began to heal as the Greek controversy slowly dies. Do the
nationals really believe that the trustees and President Sojka will back down on such a major
tenet of their new social/residential plan, or are the national organizations more interested in

dissuading other colleges from adopting “The Bucknell Plan?”

Sophomore rush itself has yet to be explored at Bucknell, but now the issue has expanded

into the-political question of “‘who runs this University.” If Sojka and the trustees back down

now, their action will be seen as succumbing to national pressure.

Sojka has pleaded for the nationals to cooperate with the new system because he knows that

without their support, the new system is destined to fail. Nevertheless, sophomore rush is here

and won’t be changed until it has at least been tried.

The nationals, if they truly wanted to be malicious, could ask their alumni to withhold

contributions from the University to make an example out of Bucknell. Clearly,

Bloomsburg, Colgate, and Glassboro. Why not make an example out of Bucknell—potentially

the University that became financially troubled after it crossed fraternities and sororities?

It is time for the nationals to stop their whining and cooperate with the new social/residen-
tial recommendations. After a trial period, it may again be time to reconsider the benefits of

sophomore rush. If the fraternities and sororities on campus continue to fight the administration

on this point, then these “guests” at our University should be asked to leave.

Either way, Sojka is correct to firmly stand his ground, and his indignation is justified.

the nationals
have an interest in preventing the idea of sophomore rush from spreading to campuses like

LEVERS TO THE EDITOR
Student describes reaction
to U.S. and war from abroad

To the Editor:

Iam a Bucknellian currently
studying abroad for the semester in
Ireland. I just received a back issue
of The Bucknellian (dated February
15th), and I wanted to respond to
the various news on the Gulf War.
Being abroad during this crisis has
awarded me an excellent opportu-
nity to view the United States and
its actions through the eyes of a
neutral country. It has been, to say
the least, a rude awakening.

My experiences began on
January 16th at a night club in
Dublin. It was there that I (and a
group of friends I was with) was
informed the United States had just
bombed Baghdad. Some young
men who had recently arrived
broke the news to us in this way:

“Are you American?” They
asked.

“Ves.”

“You just bombed Baghdad!”

“Are there any casualties?”

“American ones?”

Ses?

“What does it matter if a few
Yanks die, there are enough of you,
anyways.”

Needless to say, after feeling
quite unwanted by these and others
around us, we headed back to the
youth hostel we were staying at
(along with the other 75 Americans
who were all there for our orienta-
tion). We watched CNN, which
was connected to the Irish national

network, with some English, Aus-
tralian and German students. They,
as we, were appalled at the circus-
like coverage during the initial
bombings. Also, many were quite
incensed and resentful of Mr.
Bush’s impatience with the eco-
nomic sanctions and willingness to
use force.

is grateful for its “Big Brother”
approach to foreign policy. On the
contrary, they see right through the
rhetoric and political smoke
screens. They believe Americans
are arrogant and full of themselves,
especially when it comes to their
interpretation of their place and
“duty” in this world.

’

The “New World Order,” the flag-waving,
the glowing speeches to Congress and
the congratulatory messages and pats

on the back to the Allied soldiers just
don’t wash over here (in Irelanq).

rr

Iam writing this at a time
when American public opinion of
the President is soaring; he has
come out of the war looking better
than when he entered it. To the
Trish and I dare say to other coun-
tries as well, however, he is still
resented. The “New World Order,”
the flag-waving, the glowing
speeches to Congress and the con-
gratulatory messages and pats on
the back to the Allied soldiers just
don’t wash over here.

I do not think Americans
realize that just because a country
is neutral doesn’t mean it automati-
cally, silently supports the U.S. and

The main reason I am writing
this is not to blast the Administra-
tion, or America for that matter.
Rather, I wanted to give students
what I have received while abroad:
namely an inclination to reject
American propaganda and the in-
formation spoon-fed to us by the
media. The Irish, especially the
students, have a tendency (as would
citizens of any neutral country, I
think) to be overly cautious when
listening to leaders such as George
Bush or John Majors. Instead, they
approach each situation as unique
and form an opinion based on the
facts and contexts of that situation

alone. Their opinions are not pre-
determined, rather they read,
watch, listen and investigate for
themselves.

This political awareness is
something I believe we, as Ameri-
cans, lack. A majority of the
population is content to sit back
and let their opinions be dictated to
them. I have seen first-hand what
it means to be politically aware. I
was asked, usually right after meet-
ing not just students but families,
shop-keepers, etc. what I thought
about the Gulf situation. For the
first time in my life I wasn’t sur-
rounded with American propa-
ganda or Americans. A simple,
“Yes, I agree” or “No, I don’t
agree” would not suffice, and I
don’t think it should in America,
either. Next time someone asks
you your opinion on any political
issue, stop and think if you really
have weighed the issues, if you
even know what the issues are, and
if you are prepared to question the
usual “democratic” or “republican”
party line. A politically conscious
population is, I believe, an asset to
our country as a whole, as it will
keep the government in check and
force it, in turn, to examine each
Situation more closely.

To the Editor: Another factor of great

importance to me is the many
things that a teacher can learn
from his or her students.
Though I do not know each and
every one of you I have leamed
from you all. Your focus, your
commitment, your resiliency,
your toughness, your sensitivity,
your patience, and most impor-
tantly
your
work
ethic.
You do
all this
while
balancing
time with
the many
demands
of your
academic
life at
Bucknell.

I can only hope that I have
been able to serve you equally.
Tam privileged to teach.

This letter cannot express
ten years of feelings. The highs
and lows, more importantly, the
many rewards of working with
you. I want it to express ten
years of appreciation.

I wish you all the very
best. Thank you for who you
are, what you are, where you are
going, and how you are getting
there.

It is with great feeling and
emotion that I write to you.
After spending ten of the most
positive years of my life I have
decided to leave Bucknell. This
was the most difficult decision
that I have ever made. I feel it
is the right one for my family
and myself.

Ini- SS ae
tially, I would
like to ex-
press my
appreciation
for who you
are and what
you represent.
The people at
this Univer-
sity have
always been
the most
important
thing to me. You are great
people. I consider myself fortu-
nate to have had the privilege to
see many young men and
women enter this school as
freshmen and progress through
their college careers. Some
people consider it solely a pas-
sage of time. It is, more impor-
tantly, a passage of life. As an
educator I value the chance to
have an effect on the develop-
ment of any young person. At
times in our profession as
coaches we get too tied up with
winning and losing and lose
track of our task as role models
and teachers. I constantly re-
mind myself of what is most
important and hope that I will
never lose focus of that fact.

At times in our profes-
sion as coaches we

Sojka dug his own grave HOW BOUT THAT

BAIR

WELL, I FOR ONE
THOUGHT THAT THAT
MOVE WAS GOING To
BE Agout some -

By Andrew Cohen

Justice is traditionally thought
of as getting what you deserve. If
that is true, then I know that there is
God out there somewhere, because,
boy oh boy, did poor President Sojka
get what he deserved. Through a
combination of naivete, putting his
trust in incompetents, and pure gut-
lessness Sojka finds himself in a
royal mess.

A little less than a year ago
Sojka’s “grand plan” for single-
handedly reshaping the “‘social/resi-
dential” system was presented to the
students and faculty with a reception
worse than that received by Rosanne
Barr’s stirring rendition of the na-
tional anthem. Now, Sojka is feeling
the heat from fraternity and sorority
nationals to change yet another tenet
of the plan, sophomore rush. Un-
derstandably, he is pissed. He’s
mad because several other facets of
his pathetic plan have been no less
pathetically slimed out of by the
students, specifically by the high and
mighty TIP task force, and now this
one may go by the wayside as well.

The problem, though, is not
the specific sophomore rush pro-
posal. Although its inanity is self-
evident, it is merely a symptom.
Sophomore rush was the bone Sojka
threw to the faculty. What he prob-
ably does not understand to this day
is that instead of pleasing both fac-
tions, the greeks and the faculty, he

A
Different
Drum

By Marc Haimes

My cousin Decker was only
three and didn’t really understand
the joke, but would still toddle over
to all the relatives wiggling his
plamp butt and babble, “Whath
bwack and wite and wed all ova?”
in a sing-song voice.

“I DON’T KNOW!” declared
grandma in wide-cyed suspense,
even though he had just told her two
minutes ago. “I'LL BET ONLY A
BIG BOY KNOWS THE ANSWER
TO THAT!” She tussled his hair

greatly angered each group.

Sojka’s recommendations
were a non-sequitur to the faculty’s
motion, The motion that passed was
based on principles. Whether or not
it was correct, the sentiments of the
faculty could not be appeased by
such whorish tactics. Evidence of
this is that the faculty does not even
care any more. They are not in-
volved in implementing the changes
because they did not ask for them.
They asked for a type of thinking
that Sojka, the consummate politi-
cian, could not comprehend even if
it kicked him in the ass.

It is understandable why the
students are upset. Our very way of
living, a way of living that we de-
fended in the intellectual tradition of
all the great Sophists, was, and is, at
stake. And now, it seems that we
will have the last laugh by denying
our fine institution its endowment.
That’s what’s going on. The frater-
nity nationals (and to a lesser extent
sorority nationals) were scared about
the possibility that this plan would
spread to other colleges. So they
petitioned their alumni not to con-
tribute unless sophomore rush was
changed. What student concern
could not change, money could.
Now Sojka must cave in yet again.
It seems that he will lose the battle
of the crybabies, or at the very least,
end up crying more.

The irony of this is that the re-
nowned “Sojka plan” developed be-

and pinched his chubby cheeks.

He giggled hysterically in an-
ticipation. “A NEWTHPAPER!”
He screamed triumphantly, wetting
his pants for the third time that day.

All the grandparents cracked
up and said things like, “He’s so
adorable... and smart too. ..I' ll bet
he becomes president!” Decker
wasn’t really listening because he
was busy stuffing the chocolates and
maraschino cherries they had given
him into his mouth.

He chewed his prizes into a
reddish brown goop. Then suddenly
he burst out laughing again spraying
the mostly masticated mixture into
the air and onto the rug. The rela-
tives cackled and clapped their
hands delightedly. As if John
Kennedy had risen from the grave,
shook their hands, and regurgitated
reddish brown goop on the floor.

STREETBEAT:

Psychology

With obvious health risks,
condoms are the best way to
practice safe sex. We are all
adults at this school. If we make
the choice to have sex, the op-
portunity to have safe sex should
be available. The availability of
condoms in dormitories makes it
more convenient for us to have
safe sex.

I believe condoms should be avail-

easy accessibility is important

STD’s or AIDS.

cause he could not hold firm to his
original “vision.”

President Sojka is a man with
delusions of grandeur. His first
revelation was to make all Greek
organizations go co-ed. He did this
without even endeavoring to ask the
one fraternity with a co-ed history
(Phi Lamda Theta, now Chi Phi)
about the myriad of problems that
arose out of that arrangement.
Thankfully, about a week before the
long awaited “Open Forum,” Sojka
kowtowed to pressure from Greek
nationals and abandoned this no less
idiotic proposal.

Waiting in the wings to step in
and pick up the pieces was Sojka’s
trusted ingenue, Vice President
Charlotte Jacobsen-Weddle.
Weddle permitted Sojka to hold on
to his infantile delusions while ad-
vancing her own agenda. Weddle,
at least as much as Sojka, formulated
the recommendations, and, was in-
stalled as co-head of the TIP task
force. Weddle’s role in the “Gen-
esis” of the social/residential system
is common knowledge.

One cannot help but to feel
sorry for Sojka. After all, he did not
act maliciously, and in fact he is a
very nice man. But, he caused the
dilemma he now faces. He was na-
ive by trying to compromise be-
tween the students and the faculty.
This was fundamentally impossible
given the faculty’s moral objections
to the Greek system. Right or wrong

I was twelve. Too old to be
cute and too young to be respected.
I sat in the corner relishing my pre-
pubescent misery.

“Whath Bwack and Whith and

my knees. The room hushed as ev-
eryone waited breathlessly for his
answer.

“That’s such a dumb joke.” I
told him. “Everybody knows it.”
Why don’t you learn a new one and
stop being such a little brat...”

Later that night, they visited
my room, where I had been ban-
ished, and requested that I apologize
to the little monster.

“But why?” I protested. “I
was only being honest. You always
made it clear that
honesty=goodness. Remember?”

My response elicited no sym-

in this case, morals cannot be com-
promised, and Sojka failed to realize
that.

ought not have, Charlotte Jacosben-

sonal reasons.” Sorry Sojka, that

pathy and I was deeply confused. . .
about “goodness” and “badness.”
Still am today.

Take these new events in Iraq
for example. Before this rebellion
stuff, everything was very simple. . .
Iraqi’s were bad because they were
invading a foreign country and being
mean to people. Hussein, the Iraqi
leader, was especially bad, because
he was VERY mean to people. He
is also fat and ugly and has a first
name that sounds like “Sodomy.”
George Bush was good because he
was willing to stand up for his beliefs
and take any action that would stop
the bad men and their satanic leader
from being mean with big brown
bombs sprayed in the air. The Saudi
Arabians were good because, even
though they treat women like used
Kleenexes, they were helping the
Americans/good guys kill the Iraqi/
bad guys. When Americans (good)

Finally, Sojka was gutless.
Every proposal he made he has
caved in on. But this is not the big-
gest area where Sojka showed him-
self to be made of the same fiber as
“brave brave Sir Robin, brave Sir
Robin (who) ran away.” Last spring
Sojka had to make a decision. He
could not cut the baby in half. But,

beat the hell out of the Iraqi’s (bad)
it was a triumphant time for all. And
we cackled and clapped our hands
delightedly in praise of our leader.
Recently, we have discovered
that Sa-DAMN Hussein is, in fact,
STILL being mean to people. But
now because of this new cease fire
(good), the Americans (good) are
no longer allowed to stop Satan
Hussein from doing these downright
nasty things. At first, | thought the
reason for this inaction on the part of
the good guys was because the
people getting tortured and killed
were Iraqi’s (bad). After all, we
killed one or two before and it was
no big deal. But this can’t be right
because these Iraqi’s were actually
encouraged by the Americans (good
in case you've forgotten) to fight
against Sadman Hussein. Making
this particular group of Iraqi’s good.
This means it’s not okay to kill them.

By Corey Zayatz

alas, he tried to do so. Now the
Greek system holding one bloody
half wants to get back the other
since the faculty has had the grace
to walk away without theirs. Sojka,
you are definitely no Solomon, you
God damn deserve what you got
yourself into.

Which means allowing it to happen
would be. . . no wait a minute I’m
missing something here.

Things seem to have become
very complicated all of a sudden.
Where is the simple scenario every-
one believed in when we were
“kicking ass” and taking a stand
against cruelty and injustice just a
few weeks ago? I mean, if the situ-
ation has always been this intricate
and there were, in fact, one or two
people who may not have been
completely bad getting killed, then
we probably shouldn’t have been so
blindly “euphoric” for these past few
weeks. But we couldn’t help getting
excited! After all Bush’s plan to de-
stroy the Iraqi army and stop the ter-
ror worked so brilliantly. . .

Oh well. It seems like nothing
is black or white.

Just red all over.

Should condoms be available on campus
to students?

Beth Birdsey ’94
Elementary Education

College students are legal adults
making (supposedly) adult deci-
sions. While the inconvenience of
buying condoms may hinder
younger students from having sex,
that doesn’t apply here. So, yes,
condoms should be availbale on
campus. It won’t promote sex, it
will promote concern for safety,
and it will discourage careless sex.

Tim Emmett ’91
Economics/Philosopy

As a Christian who believes that
premarital sex is wrong, I couldn’t
be consistent with my beliefs and
support the availability of condoms
on campus. Furthermore, I don’t
think most Bucknellians have a
difficult time geting condoms if
they really want them.

Shanna Gemmill ’92
Management

Condoms should be available to
students so as to continually pro-
mote safe sex, thereby avoiding
unwanted pregnancy and disease.

ON }
Evan Lippman ’91

Of course, it’s only sex. If safe
sex is going to be practiced,
putting condoms in dorms or on
halls just makes it convenient
for all concerned.

Taking Care of Business

By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

Despite its trite title and
unoriginal “rich guy meets poor
guy” premise, Taking Care of
Business actually boasts some
good gags, zesty corporate satire,
and a few surprisingly bittersweet
moments; sending a 90’s style fax
to the traditional Trading Places
type agenda.

With the hokey theme song
blaring in the background, we meet
a wealthy, anal yuppie (Charles
Grodin, Midnight Run), the type of
guy who interrupts a passionate
bathroom romp with his spouse to
make sure his file-o-fax style
datebook is safe. Next comes the
jocular yet sensitive, incarcerated
car-thief (James Belushi, Saturday
Night Live) who seems to be able
to handle any situation with a boy-
ish smirk and a clever quip allud-
ing to various parts of the feminine
anatomy. Before the opening mu-
sic even gets to the guitar solo, the
yuppie, who has been ditched by
his neglected wife, goes to L.A.,
loses his datebook with his I.D.,
and ends up in a slum. The car-
thief, who has broken out of jail so
he can see the World Series, goes
to L.A., finds the datebook with the
I.D., and ends up in a corporate
mansion.

Grodin digs deep into his

briefcase of pathetic facial expres-
sions as he is mugged, arrested, and
generally harassed by the L.A.
population. Meanwhile, Belushi
lends his impish/obnoxious charm
to the business world. “Here’s to
the Cubs winning the World Se-
ries....and Big Tits,” he toasts at a
stuffy business dinner before mak-
ing cute “goggle-eye” expressions
and suggestive gestures at the
boss’s beautiful dental-floss-bi-
kini-clad daughter.

The film picks up when
Grodin and Belushi meet and com-
bine their eclectic talents to as-
suage the confusion caused by their
changed identities. The two come-
dians work well together and create
a believable and sensitive (in a
glossy, 90's kind of way) relation-
ship. There is even a touching final
scene with a cute puppy and a cry-
ing woman.

As Grodin and Belushi drive
off into the sunset in their snappy
red sports car, we feel confident
that our ex-con has become more
mature and, perhaps, slightly less
sexist. Our yuppie has learned that
being anal can get banal; take your
life lightly and relish the simple
joys.

If you’re into light entertain-
ment and simple joys, then pencil
Taking Care of Business onto your
datebook.

Choreographer Suzanne Hawe
is one of four guest artists now in
residence preparing for the Spring
Weekend musical A History of the
American Film by Christopher
Durang with music by Mel Marvin.
Rehearsals began three weeks ago
under the direction of Gary Grant,
assistant professor of theatre.

As an undergraduate at
Skidmore College, Hawe began her
formal dance training which was
highlighted by a semester of inten-
sive dance study in Monte Carlo.
After graduating, she worked with
numerous dance companies, per-
forming in works of ballet, jazz, and
moder dance.

Dance Machine was what she now
refers to as “a classic dancer story.”
She happened to walk into a re-
hearsal on the day that one of the
lead dancers had quit, just four days
before a national tour was to begin.
She was allowed to stay for the day’s
rehearsal, and then to join the com-
pany. It was “a trial by fire,” Hawe
says, but a successful one, and she
launched into what would be a long
and productive relationship with the
company.

A comic survey of classic
American films from the early
1920’s to the 1970’s, A History of
the American Film has provided
Hawe with teaching and choreo-
graphing opportunities similar to her
work in Dance Machine. The com-
pany often recreated characters and
scenes to support their dance recon-
structions, producing shows that
were as much like musicals as dance
concerts. Hawe’s experience with
historical periods of American dance
has given her the expertise needed to
set A History of the American Film
in motion.

Hawe especially enjoys the
opportunity to collaborate with di-
rector Gary Grant. “Working by
yourself is like working in a void,”
she says, and “working with a di-
rector is always a collaborative ef-
fort.” She and Grant work together
to achieve dynamic staging for the
entire show, using each other as
“another pair of eyes,” as Hawe puts
it. “When you are choreographing a
musical, you always have to be in
sync with the director.”

Three other guest artists join
Hawe in the production team of A
History of the American Film.

Lighting designer Peter Anderson,
who received his Master of Fine Arts
degree from New York University
School of the Arts, has designed off-
Broadway, in regional theatres, and
for numerous dance companies.
Costume designer Wendy Rolf, a
former student of director Gary
Grant who received her Master of
Fine Arts in design from the Yale
School of Drama, has designed cos-
tumes for both film and stage. Mu-
sical Director and pianist Andrew
Levine has worked in regional and
stock companies and also enjoys
teaching at the university level.

All four artists are guest lec-
turing in various classes in the de-
partment of theatre and dance.
Suzanne Hawe will teach a series of
classes in various dance styles from
television to film and stage begin-
ning today and continuing Friday,
Apr. 12 & 19, from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m.
in Tustin Dance Studio. She will also
teach a tap dance class tomorrow and
Saturday, Apr. 13 & 20, from 10:00
to 11:30 a.m. in the Fieldhouse
Dance Studio. Both classes are free
and open to the public; call x 1235 for
more information.

A History of the American
Film will be performed on Apr. 26,
27, 28, and 29 at 8 p.m. in the Uni-
versity Theatre in Coleman Hall.
Tickets are $3.50 (with a $2.50 stu-
dent discount on Sunday and Mon-
day) and will go on sale at the L.C.
Box Office on Monday, April 8. The
production is co-sponsored by the
Department of Theatre and Dance
and Cap and Dagger with additional
funding provided by BSG, COSP,
and the Bucknell Association for the
Arts.

The diVinyls aim | Lyon Orchestra comes to Weis

“One of Europe’s biggest and finest” ensembles performs tonight

for mass appeal

Australian band releases album

By Matthew P. Wood
Staff Writer

Rock fans, meet the
diVinyls. No, this is not exactly the
Australian band’s first at-bat in the
big league; however, this is not the
same band that made a small name
for itself with its first album, Des-
perate, in 1983. The new album,
simply entitled diVinyls, is clearly
an effort to arouse mass appeal.
The first cut, “I Touch Myself,” has
rather masterfully succeeded in
doing just that, but the question
remains, does the rest of the album
mect up to the racy, guiltless charm
of this single?

The group features vocalist
Christina Amphlett and guitarist
Mark McEntee, but it is undoubt-
edly Amphlett’s singing that sus-
tains the music. Her raspy yet
soothing delivery breathes sexual-
ity, and not surprisingly, the songs
that take advantage of this most are
the ones that stick. “I Touch My-
self,” with its openly arousing
theme, is a prime example of this.
Two other promising tracks at the
beginning of the album, “Lay Your
Body Down” and “Love School,”
employ a similar approach. In the

case of these songs; Amphlett’s
voice in combination with a few
catchy riffs is more than enough to
satisfy a listener.

What is unfortunate is that
much of the rest of the album
seems to float around with very
little to say musically or otherwise.
Although McEntee’s guitar work is
for the most part solid, the group
simply lacks the firepower to sus-
tain a song like “Bless My Soul
(It’s Rock-n-Roll).” Such tracks
would probably be better left to a
testosterone-charged band like AC/
DC. One of the few redeeming
songs is the second to last track
entitled “Bullet.” Like “I Touch
Myself,” the song is cleverly writ-
ten and performed and could prove
to be a real gem on mainstream
AOR radio.

The potential of the diVinyls
is evidenced by the flashes of truly
flavorful pop rock that are pre-
sented. On the other hand, the lack
of continuity suggests something
else. Are they interested in keeping
old fans or making new ones? Un-
til the diVinyls choose a direction
and commit to it, they may find
their luck best in the singles mar-
ket.

Heralded as “‘a feast for the
ears” by the Washington Post, the
highly celebrated Lyon Orchestra
will be presenting a concert tonight
at 8 p.m. in the Weis Center.

The Orchestre National de
Lyon, from France’s renowned cul-
tural and economic center, is headed
by conductor Emmanuel Krivine. He
earned his prominent reputation as a
guest conductor of the Radio France
New Philharmonic Orchestra in
Paris in 1976, the London Sym-
phony the Rotterdam and
Amsterdam Philharmonics, and the
Royal Philharmonic. In 1986, the
110-member Lyon Orchestra made
its debut in North America and
shortly thereafter, Krivine became
the musical director and permanent
conductor of Lyon, “one of Europe’s
biggest and finest” ensembles.
Krivine, originally from Grenoble,
Started out as a violinist but was soon
consumed by conducting. This Sep-
tember he will be in Prague con-
ducting the Paris Orchestra for the
“Mozart Bicentennial Celebrations.”

Pieces to be performed at the
concert, which will bring to a close
the third concert season at the Weis
Center, will include Mozart's
“Symphony No. 31,” Bizet’s
“L’Arlesienne Suite,” and Berlioz’s
“Symphonie Fantastique.”

Emphasizing women’s expe-
rience and visions as well as themes
of hope, healing and recovery, the
concert will feature folk, blues, New
Age and show tunes. Taylor plays
the guitar and sings her own original
songs, along with popular material.
She says she tries to focus on “dis
covering a meaningful connection to
the spiritual aspect of life, and sur-
viving life’s bumps and knocks with
humor and grace,” through her mu-
sic.

In addition to the concert,
Taylor will present a workshop on
sobriety and recovery from sub-
stance abuse entitled “Alternative
Highs” 3 - 5 p.m. tomorrow in the
Roberts Hall Second Floor Lounge.
Addictive behaviors and substance
abuse attempt to mask the pain of
living, according to Taylor. She
claims, “When we numb ourselves
to the pain, we also numb ourselves
to true joy.” Through visualization,
song and experimental activities, the
workshop will focus on learning to
bear the full range of human emo
tiohs as one of the main lessons of
recovery. Taylor says, “Reclaiming
our own authentic ecstasy, sanely
and appropriately, is essential to the
healing process.”

Prisoners’ constitutional and human
rights defended by local volunteers

Lewisburg Prison Project staffed by students, faculty and townspeople

By Jennifer Breheny
Staff Writer

A poster that reads: “Blind
Justice...out of sight, out of mind,
out of date” hangs on a door in the
headquarters of the Lewisburg
Prison Project (LPP) and serves as a
motto for the volunteers of the spe-
cial program. The six Bucknell stu-
dents and ten adults that run the LPP
work to secure prisoner rights be-
hind the walls of the Lewisburg
Federal Penitentiary.

The Lewisburg Penitentiary is
a federal maximum security prison
for adult males. These men, many of
whom do not hold high school di-
plomas, rely on the volunteers to
help convey their frustrations and
mistreatments to those who can help

change their conditions.

According to Karl Patten, pro-
fessor of English and an active vol-
unteer of the LPP, the volunteers
“work to protect prisoners’ constitu-

over the whole prison, adds Patten.
The workers at the LPP re-
ceive at least 20 letters a week from

some of which include overcrowd-

“(Volunteers) receive at least 20 letters

overcrowding, racial discrimination,
mail tampering and inadequate

tional and human rights and to im-
prove the prison conditions.” These
volunteers work as “watchdogs”

ing, racial discrimination, mail tam-
pering and inadequate medical care.
Protective custody is another

problem that prisoners address in
their letters to the LPP. One man
writes that he fears for his life be-
cause he is behind the same bars as
the men that he “sold-out” in court.
Afraid of retaliation, he refuses to go
into the “population” (mix with the
other prisoners).

He has asked the prison au-
thorities to shield him from his en-
emies by providing him with protec-
tive custody. Thus far, his request
has been denied because he refuses
to “name names.” When he is asked
to go to his prison job or the cafete-
ria, he refuses. Each refusal costs
him 30 days in segregation and a loss
of important “good time” which
earns a prisoner early parole.

The LPP has filed a class ac-
tion suit against the prison. The case
has not yet been heard.

Victorian era recreated at Slifer House Museum

By David Murray
Staff Writer

Returning from the battle-
fields of the Civil War in 1850,
Colonel Eli Slifer built a mansion in
Lewisburg so beautiful that the 1862
Godey’s Lady Book cited it as an
example of impressive architecture.

Following Slifer’s death in
1888, the mansion served as the
Evangelical Association’s home for
the aged, as well as a hospital and
an orphanage. Since 1975, how-
ever, the home has been restored to
the Victorian style, recreating the
original splendor of the mansion in
careful detail.

The Slifer House has been
preserved as a museum and is listed
in both the Pennsylvania and Na-
tional Registers of Historic Places.

The Victorian exterior of
Slifer House has been perfectly mir-
rored in the interior furnishings.
From the well-worn, turn-of-the-
century leather couch in the sitting
room, to the walk-out second-story
windows that lead to the shaded ve-
randa, examples of Victorian life and
culture abound.

Each room is filled with Vic-
torian artifacts and momentos con-
tributed by local residents or crafts-
men. Visitors find items as varied as
a civil war amputation kit and a gi-
ant, still-useable music box, a child’s
doll house and an antique curling
iron

Collegiate Perspective
(and other fairy tales)

By Peter Lalos
Staff Writer

Springtime at Bucknell Uni-
versity means that the minds of all
college students will soon be turn-
ing to... final exams. But that’s not
quite the point that I’m getting at.
No, spring means a time for re-
newed romances after a long, frigid
winter of lonely nights and doing
the social scene thing solo. It’s
about at this point in the year, in
fact, when mating season begins for
all of God’s creatures, and around
campus you start to feel as if you
need a score card to see who’s
scoring. Well, let’s see if we can
put together a clear picture of ex-
actly what types of pairings you'll
be running into for the rest of the
year.

1 « 39
couple; This duo is basically to-
gether for the purpose of making
each other’s life miserable. Their
relationship is most often charac-
terized by: 1) two-hour long tele-
phone brouhahas which invariably
end in one of them slamming down
the receiver in exasperation, claim-
ing that he/she will never speak to
the other again; 2) downright ugly
spats during otherwise fun social
events which effectively spread
their misery to each and every one
of their friends in attendance,
thereby ruining everyone’s time;
and 3) mutual physical abuse, such
as the hurling of lawn furniture,
framed pictures of their high school
prom, and various pieces of farm-
ing equipment at each other no less
frequently than once a month. All
of these abuses seemingly fall by
the wayside, however, because
deep down this couple really does
love each other.

Uh, yeah.

Prospects for the future:
Annoyingly enough, the success
rate for this class is surprisingly
high among college-age students—
apparently, masochism is the func-
tional word here. Exceptions to this
rate are usually attributed to suicide
by one partner in a fit of emotional
distress over the relationship’s lat-
est fight, or the homicidal death of
one of the two people (committed
by the other partner, of course).

2) “Copulation Mal I

es : The
cement that holds this pair together
is sex— nothing else. There is a
very definite line between love and
lust, and this type of bond exempli-
fies this fact to a tee. They don’t
watch movies together, or out to
restaurants to eat, or go to parties
with one another like normal

couples do on dates. They just...
well, they just do the dirty deed.

Prospects for the future: 50-
50. On the down side, the female
will get pregnant, and the male
partner will exert his fine sense of
adult responsibility and bolt before
the ¢.p.t. dot turns pink. On the
other hand, he will stay with her,
they'll both drop out of college, opt
for the shotgun marriage, and will
live on food stamps for the rest of
their lives with their 17 children.
The option of abortion could also
be taken, if the female’s fear of the
clinic being bombed by pro-lifers
during the procedure is not too
great to overwhelm her fear of be-
ing put behind the cight ball for the
rest of her life by having a child she
can’t support, even if the husband
decides to live up to his actions and
stay with her. Whether they stick it
Out Or not, two aspects of this type
of relationship are definite: 1) the
female will inevitably become
pregnant, and 2) one or both of
them will eventually be pouring out
the events of their sordid union on
The Oprah Winfrey Show at some
point in the future and receive un-
due clucks of sympathy from the
studio audience for their plight.

3) “Kiss Kiss, Vi j
Snookums” couple: This rela-

tionship is characterized by its
unique ability to make you regur-
gitate upon seeing its partners’ ex-
trancous adoration for one another.
Earmarks of this bothersome
couple include hand-holding wher-
ever they go (while getting the
mail, etc.), “I don’t give a flying
fart if you see us “ smooching in
public, and/or the usage of entirely
unneeded nicknames for each other
(e.g., “sugar tushie”, “the sole rea-
son I continue respirating”, “my
big/litde snuggle pouch”).

Prospects for the future:
Unlikely to last due to extreme ar-
tificiality. One or both people dies
of diabetes... we hope.

4) “Romeo and Juliet”
couple; Secing this pair together
just makes you feel good all over.
Wherever they go, children are
frolicking in the tall cattails, the sun
is shining gaily, and some dog
named Wuf is happily chasing its
tail. Basically, knowing a Romeo
and Julict couple gives us all hope
and inspiration for our own ro-
mantic endeavors. They look good
together, they have the same inter-
ests, and they make an unbeatable
team in Pictionary.

Prospects for the future;
Can’t miss. A done deal. Almost
mythical in how right the relation-
ship seems. It’s just... wow.

Men’s lax to play Holy Cross tomorrow

Team optimistic after competitive pla

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

The Bison Men’s Lacrosse
team (0-3) remained winless this
season after losing to Army 19-6 on
Saturday. The team looks to get on
track when they play Holy Cross
tomorrow. Head Coach Sid
Jamieson continues to remain opti-
mistic about the team’s play as he
strives for the Patriot League title.

The Bison played their first
Patriot League team when they took
on Army. Thus far the Bison have
had the misfortune of playing three
of the top cleven teams in the coun-
try in Georgetown, Princeton, and
Army. As a result, the team has
struggled to get their first win.

The game was somewhat un-
usual, according to Jamieson. After
being tied 2-2 during the first quar-
ter, Army exploded for eight unan-
swered goals. Suddenly down 10-2,
the Bison failed to stay competitive.
They did manage to generate some

offense, but the six goals they scored
were not enough to put a dent into
the Army lead.

Goals were scored for the Bi-
son by Garret Schwartz ‘91, who led
the way for the Bison with two goals
while co-captain Tom Davis ‘91,
Doug DePietro ‘92, Todd Streelman
“93, and Chuck Twoguns ‘93 tallied
one apiece. Colin Barker ‘94 played
three quarters in goal, stopping 20
shots and allowing 18 goals. Matt
Wojnovich ‘94 played the final
quarter, stopping two shots while al-
lowing one goal.

According to Jamieson, the
team is only slightly behind sched-
ule this season, and that they did as
well as could be expected against the
tough Army team.

“We started out playing well
and then there were the eight goals
in arow. Unfortunately they pressed
and held us.” Jamieson wishes to
remain positive about the season,
and says that the Bison have been
doing a few things very well thus far.

Softball, 9-4-1, sweeps St.

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The women’s softball team
boosted its record to 9-4-1 for the
season by sweeping a doubleheader
against St. Francis on Wednesday 9-
1 and 8-4. Sharon Nichols ’91
picked up her fourth win in the first
game, allowing only five hits and
striking out nine in seven innings of
work. Lisa Fink ’93 got her third
win in the second game, giving up
only two hits while striking out six.

St. Francis put up a run on the
board early against Nichols to take a
1-0 lead in the first inning, but the
Lady Bison responded by scoring a
run in the second, two in the third
and fourth, and four more in the bot-
tom of the fifth inning. Heather
Hoehn ’94, who was batting .545
going into the game, led the offen-
sive attack by batting 3 for 4 with
two doubles and two RBI. Second-
baseman Jen Kalochie ’91 went 1 for
3, bringing in two runners of her
own.

The one-two combination did
the majority of work on the offensive
end in the second game as leadoff
hitter Jen Yuengling °93 and
Kalochie combined for two runs and
four RBI and had three of the team’s
eight hits to pace Bucknell to the 8-4
victory. The rest of the team did
their share by taking six free passes
on walks and allowing St. Francis
pitcher Melissa Freedman no
strikeouts for the entire game.

_ Before the St. Francis games
the team enjoyed a successful road
trip over spring break in Myrtle

Beach, S.C., posting a 6-2 record for
the week. Bucknell lost to the host
team Coastal Carolina twice, 1-0 and

‘

Colin Barker ‘94 has been one of the bright spots for the inexperi-
enced Bison squad. Against Georgetown, Barker recorded 17 saves

“Our face-offs have been excellent,”
he said.

The main problem that has
hindered the Bison has been scoring.
After losing several of their domi-
nant scorers this season, the team has
not established that aspect of their
game. “I knew it would be difficult
this year,” said Jamieson. “We lost
all of our scoring power.”

Jamieson is looking now for
the team to pick up its first win in an
attempt to instill some confidence in
the players. ““We have a good team,”
he said. “Things just haven’t come
together as quickly as we had hoped.
We have a competitive schedule, and
I feel that as soon as we win our first
game and get over the hump, things
will turn around for us. As a young
team, all we need is confidence and
experience.”

Co-captain Pat Sheridan ‘91
feels that the team will come around
in the future. “I feel pretty optimis-
tic about the rest of the season. We
have a couple of freshmen who have
played some key roles this season.
Our goalies [Wojnavich and
Barker] have been coming along
well. It’s unfortunate that our
toughest games have all come in the
first few weeks. Our losses have
definitely not been due to a lack of
work, though. We've practiced
hard. I think that once we get into a

7-1, but swept each of the three New
York teams; SUNY-Albany, SUNY-
Stony Brook, and Kings College,

more regular schedule in April,
things will improve.”

The Bison will have their first
real opportunity for a victory when
the face Holy Cross on Saturday.
The Crusaders are struggling this
season as well, posting a record of 0-
4 . Jamieson stressed that this game
will be the first true “Patriot League
type game” in that they will be con-
siderably less competitive. “They
have the same type program as us.
We hope that this will be the game
where we turn things around.”

The schedule for the rest of the
year will not be kind to the Bison, as
they will be playing top ranked
teams for the rest of the season.
“Our program is challenging,”
Jamieson remarked. “We could play
a schedule where we win seventy-
five to eighty percent of our games.
That’s not our goal. We try to play
the schools like Towson which will
provide us with a challenge.”

Jamieson feels that despite the
difficulty of the schedule, the Bison
have the potential to finish first or
second in the Patriot League. “It’s
never easy to finish .500 [for the
season]. We just need to find our-
selves. I'd like to win the Patriot
League. Army will be tough for
anyone to beat, though.”

Despite going winless in their
first three games, the Bison feel that

Golf splits first two

By Chris Drowne
Staff Writer

While most of us were secking
sand and water these past couple of
weeks, the golf team tried its best to
avoid them. Head Coach Tommy
Thompson’s young squad (four
freshmen, zero seniors) teed off its
season in North Carolina before re-
turning north to Lewisburg.

North Carolina’s vast
Woodlakes Country Club was the
site of the season-opening
Woodlakes Invitational. The Bison
finished fourth out of the six schools,
ahead of Brown and Lebanon Val-
ley. Lehigh, Frederick, and
Lafayette grabbed first through third
places, respectively.

Zach Vogel ‘93 and Doug
Dollenberg ‘94 each shot 172 for the
two-round tournament to lead the
Bison. Only two of the 36 compet-
ing golfers managed to break 80 on
the par 72 course during the first
round. Glenn Hertzberg ‘92 (175)
and Don Hansen ‘94 (177) rounded
out Bucknell’s scorers.

“Tt was extremely windy and
this was the first time we teed it up
this year,” said Thompson.

The winds followed the team

north for its home opener Tuesday
against Lehigh and Lock Haven.
The Bison, who defeated Lock Ha-
ven by 23 strokes, fell to the Engi-
neers, 102-116. The 14 stroke gap
was a significant improvement upon
the 58 stroke difference between the
two Patriot League rivals at the
Woodlakes Invitational less than a
week before.

“If we can continue to im-
prove as the younger players adjust,
as well as get some consistency up
and down the lineup, we can com-
pete,” added Thompson.

Once again, Dollenberg led
the way with an 81 as only two
strokes separated the top four Bison
finishers, Hertzberg, Hansen, (the
top scorer this past fall) and captain
Michael Smigie ‘92. Lehigh’s John
Logue, gold-medalist at Woodlakes,
led all golfers with a 77.

The team hopes to improve
upon its one-and-one record when it
hosts Lafayette, Ryder, and
Swarthmore next Tuesday.

“Our guys are capable of im-
proving and shooting down in the
seventies. We just have to avoid
counting those scores in the mid- to
high eighties,” concluded Thomp-
son.

Rugby moves to 2-0

By Mitch Benton
Staff Writer

Sophomore Howie Fetzer’s
three second-half field goals led the
Bucknell Men’s Rugby Club to their
second consecutive victory of the
young spring season. The All-
Blacks followed last week’s 50-0
mauling of Dickinson College with
a hard fought, 9-8 victory over their
traditional rival, Lafayette College.

Bucknell was forced to come
back twice in the match, held at
Lafayette, and came through on both
occasions as Fetzer provided all of
the scoring.

Lafayette scored the first
points in the match midway through
the first of the two forty-minute
halves. The Leopard forwards won
possession of the ball deep in their
own zone and quickly relayed it out
to their backs. Eventually they
worked it to the outside center who
used fakes and outstanding speed to
cover the length of the field. After
the missed point, the score stood at
4-0, where it stayed for the duration
of the half, despite a number of All-
Black scoring opportunities. The
team missed a pair of field goals
against a strong wind as well failing
to capitalize on numerous chances
on the Lafayette goal.

Bucknell opened their scoring
early in the second half on the first
of the three-pointers and looked to

take the lead for good on the second.

Once again, Lafayette proved
their mettle on another long scoring
run by the outside center. Bucknell’s
forwards had won the ball in a line
out, but quickly gave up possession
to the Leopards who broke through
the All-Black’s defense for their
second score. Fortunately for the
visitors, the point after try barely
missed the uprights and Bucknell
was within two points, 8-6.

The All-Black’s forwards re-
deemed themselves on the next se-
ries. They won possession of the
ball on a scrum-down and drove
within Lafayette’s 22-meter line.

The home squad looked to
have silenced the threat with a kick,
but the referee called an off-sides
penalty, therby giving Fetzer his
third opportunity. The kick split the
uprights and Bucknell only had to
run out the clock to insure its 9-8
victory.

Co-captain Chip Bousom ‘91
was impressed with his team’s over-
all performance in the match. “Al-
though our offense wasn’t as potent
as last week, I thought that we
played a much better all-around
game. Our defense really shut down
a powerful team, and except for the
two long runs, we had the upper-
hand throughout the day.”

The All-Blacks were off over
Spring Break, but will defend their
unbeaten record at home in April.

COURTESY OF

SPORTS INFORMATION.

By Jon Terry
Staff Writer

April is now upon us, and to
hockey fans across North America
that means Stanley Cup playoffs.
With no clearcut favorite this year,
one can look forward to many ex-
citing games and some possible sur-
prises. Let’s now break down each
division:

‘Washington Capitals vs.
New York Rangers

These two evenly-matched
teams provide arguably the best first
round matchup. The Rangers will be
looking to avenge last year’s second-
round loss to the Caps when they
saw John Druce singlehandedly send
them home. The Capitals come into
the post season skating very well.
Goaltender Don Beaupre was sec-
ond in the NHL in goals against av-
erage with a 2.64, and he led the
league with five shutouts - including
two consecutively the last week of
the regular season. As for scoring,
the Caps are led by defenseman
Kevin Hatcher, who along with
center Michal Pivonka make up a
solid power play. Forwards Mike
Ridley, Kelly Miller, Druce, Dino
Ciccarelli, and defenseman Al
lafrate all enter the playoffs playing
solid, consistent hockey.

As for the Rangers, they
slumped in the last part of the season
- losing their season-long first place
throne to Pittsburgh. Goalie Mike
Richter has had a fine year between
the pipes, and is playing very well
again after a slight slump. He even
had a game this year where he made
59 saves. That game does not, how-
ever, truly reflect New York’s usu-
ally solid defense. Brian Lectch may
be the best defenseman in the NHL
this side of Ray Bourque. Mark
Hardy had a great playoffs last year,
holding down the Rangers’ battered
blue line. Oh yes, they have fire-
power up front, too. Center Bernie
Nicholls, speester Mike Gartner,
Darren Turcotte, and John
Ogrodnick can fill the net in a hurry.

EDGE: It’s a tossup, but the
Capitals’ special teams will advance
them to the second round.

New Jersey Devils vs.
Pittsburgh Penguins

The talk of Pittsburgh right
now is “The Trade”. At first the deal
that sent team scoring leader John
Cullen and Zarley Zalapski to Hart-
ford for Ron Francis, UIf
Samuclsson and Grant Jennings
seemed questionable at best. But
now that these three have led the
Pens’ spectacular charge to the top

6-1 at number one doubles. Barbera
and Cantor folded 6-1, 6-2 at number
two, and Bank, who dropped his
number five singles match 6-4, 6-3,
and Rimpel lost a tougher match at
number three doubles, fighting to a
6-7 (11-9), 6-0, 7-6 (7-4) loss.

The Bison’s woes continued
against Florida Atlantic University
in their final match of the trip, on
Friday the 29th. Playing with a
slightly revised lineup, Bucknell
nonetheless dropped the top four
singles matches, with only
Stenstrém taking his number four
effort to a third set, losing 6-4, 2-6,
6-3. Barbera played number two and
Cantor three as Charlier remained at
the top spot. At number five, Bank
was victorious 7-5, 6-3, while
Rimpel took three sets to defeat his
number six opponent 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.

Bucknell’s cause for celebra-
tion on the day was a number one
doubles victory for the familiar

. Bucknell Track Invitational

Lemieux (knock on wood Penguin
fans) and the steady scoring of
defenseman Paul Coffey and for-
wards Mark Recchi, Kevin Stevens,
and rookie Jaromir Jagr, the Pens
should be able to put points on the
board. The Penguins will have some
problems in the later round, how-
ever, as they just don’t play the de-
fensive, tight-checking hockey as-
sociated with the Stanley Cup play-
offs. This face is countered by the
fact that first-year Pens Joe Mullen
and Brian Trottier both have playoff
experience, and should be able to
guide the younger players. Tom
Barasso, despite having a streaky
year, is a former Rookie of the Year
and Vezina Trophy winner. The
twenty-five year old, eight-year vet-
eran has looked solid lately.

The Devils changed coaches
in February, opting for Tom McVie
over John Cuniff, but it doesn’t re-
ally matter - they still aren’t very
good. John MacLean and Kirk
Muller are solid up front, but center
Brendan Shanahan regressed this
year and Claude Lamieux has been
inconsistent. Bruce Driver, Ken
Daneyko, and the two Russians
make up a good defense - the team’s
strength. Chris Terreri, who had a
poor post-season last year, and the
overrated Sean Burke are the goal-
ies.

EDGE: Pittsburgh, easily. The
Pens, unbeatable at home, have
home ice advantage and way too
much firepower. Besides, any team
with a player named Laurie
(Boschman) just can’t win.

jams Divisi

Hartford Whalers ys.
Boston Bruins

Sorry Whaler fans (do any ex-
ist anyway?), but this team is not
very good. They come into the play-
offs 0-4-3 in their last seven games,
and morale is low after the trade of
two extremely popular players
(Francis and Samuelsson). John
Cullen can score, but he is small -
Cam Neely should have fun with
him. Veteran Kevin Dineen is an al-
most identical player to Cullen, only
more fragile, and he is still bitter
over the trade of Francis - his best
friend. That about leaves it up to Pat
Verbeck, their best player. The
goalkeeping tandem of Kay
Whitmore and Peter Sidorkiewicz is
suspect at best.

The Bruins, on the other hand,
are looking to repeat as Wales Con-
ference champions. Boston is led by
the steady trio of Neely, Craig
Janney, and Ray Bourque (their
combined +/- is 67!). Look for new-
comer Ken Hodge to come on strong
in the playoffs - he is very under-
rated. Add to that the fact that
netminders Andy Moog and Reggie
Lemelin have a history of awesome

Florida Atlantic matchup of Robb
Gould and Shawn Olson, who forced
a second set tie-breaker before fall-
ing 6-4, 7-6 (9-7). Barbera and
Cantor dropped 6-2, 6-4, and Bank
and Rimpel were beaten 6-2, 6-3 to
close the team’s spring break
matches on a somewhat disappoint-
ing note.

Spirits were raised briefly
upon the team’s return to Lewisburg,
as they defeated Towson State 6-3 at
home on Tuesday. Victories at both
the top two singles and the top two
doubles positions helped Bucknell
defeat their ex-ECC rivals.

Charlier proved himself as
Bucknell’s top singles player with a
three set victory over Towson’s
Kevin Scott, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. Barbera
also tumed in a solid three set vic-
tory, beating Brian Yang 6-2, 3-6, 6-
1 at the number two spot. Other
singles victories came from Cantor
at number four, 6-2, 6-2, and Bank
at number five, 6-1, 6-2.

Doubles victories were turned
in by number one Charlier and

Aprils, and the Bruins look solid.

EDGE: Boston in a cakewalk.
Hartford plays well at home, so it
probably won’t be a sweep.

Buffalo Sabres vs.
Montreal Canadiens

Watch out for Buffalo, folks,
they could be a sleeper. Dale
Howerchuk has come on strong af-
ter a slow start, and he appears fired
up for the playoffs. Alexander
Mogilny is the best of the Soviets in
the NHL, and is a potent scorer.
Pierre Turgeon and Dave
Andreychuk are also solid, two-way
forwards. The defense, led by Mike
Ramsey is also capable. The loss of
Doug Bodger to a shoulder injury
will hurt, but heavy hitters Dean
Kennedy, Uwe Krupp, and Grant
Ledyard can muscle with anybody.
The Darren Puppa/Clint Malarchuk
tandem had an off year, but have a
reputable playoff history.

Montreal has loads of poten-
tial, but they haven’t been able to in-
still fear in their opponents like in the
past. Their leading scorer this year
was Russ Courtnall. Denis Savard
came over from Chicago and turned
in a fair year by his standards, but
the Habs still wish they hadn’t parted
with Chris Chelios, who left a gap
on the blue line that the youngsters
could not fill. Of course, guys like
Stephane Richer, Savard and goalie
Patrick Roy can’t be taken lightly,
but this team just does not have
enough guns.

EDGE: Buffalo will win in
seven.

Norris Division

Minnesota North Stars vs.
Chicago Blackhawks

The Blackhawks won the
regular season NHL overall title
with 106 points, and, yes, they are
that good. Fiery coach Mike Keenan
should have Chicago brimming with
confidence going in. Steve Larmer
and Jeremy Roenick have more than
made up for Savard’s scoring. Steve
Thomas, Adam Creighton, Michel
Goulet, and former playoff hero
Wayne Presley are key men on an
excellent front line. Defenseman
Doug Wilson’s speed and rocket
shot give the Blackhawks an awe-
some power play, and fellow blue
liners Chelios, Dave Manson, and
Trent Yawney provide a tough de-
fense. On top of all that, Chicago has
the best goalie in the league in rookie
Ed Belfour, who led the NHL in
wins and goals against average.

Minnesota got off to an awful
Start this year, but later turned it
around somewhat, despite playing in
front of lousy home crowds. The
North Stars got outstanding work
this year from goalie Jon Casey.
Dave Gagner, Brian Bellows, Brian

Stenstrém, 6-4, 6-0, and number two
Barbera and Cantor, 6-1, 6-4.
Bucknell’s only three losses on the
day were by Bank and Rimpel at
number three doubles, Rimpel at
number six singles, and Stenstrém,
who fell in a tough three set number
three singles match in which he took
the first set in an 8-6 ticbreaker only
to lose the remaining sets 6-4, 6-3.

More losses were incurred by
the Bison as they travelled to
Bloomsburg yesterday to take on a
primed Huskie team which was
ranked sixth in the NCAA’s most
recent Divison II poll. Bucknell’s
only victory in the 6-1 defeat came
from Charlier and Stenstrém, who
denied Bloomsburg’s Kyle Barton
and Brian Billone at number one
doubles, 7-5, 6-4.

The other doubles matches
were both heartbreakers, in which
the duos of Barbera and Cantor and
Bank and Rimpel lost in third set
tiebreakers. All six singles matches
were lost in straight sets, most nota-

Propp, and Neal Broten provide the
scoring. Bobby Smith and UIf
Dahlen have lots of experience
which is nice to have in the playoffs,
but Minnesota has a woeful lack of
scoring depth.

EDGE: Chicago will advance
in five. The most exciting battle in
this series could be a Shane Churla -
Mike Peluso fight. These two hate
each other!

Detroit Red Wings vs.
St. Louis Blues

St. Louis was the second best
regular season team (105 pts.), and
we all know who their leader is. In
case you missed it, Brett Hull scored
86 goals this year, third highest in
NHL history. Hull’s linemate Adam
Oates is the best passer this side of
Wayne Gretzky, and Jeff Brown,
newcomer Dan Quinn, and Rod
Brind’Amour can all score also.
Former Capital Scott Stevens an-
chors the defense, along with red-hot
goalie Vincent Riendeau, who was
unbeaten in his last six starts, al-
lowing only nine goals.

Detroit has some pop in their
lineup as well, led by 104-point man
Steve Yzerman. Sergei Fedorov,
Jimmy Carson, and Kevin Miller
complement Yzerman well. The
Wings do have some very experi-
enced players, the problem is that
they aren’t very good. Brad
McCrimmon was dumped by
Calgary and Doug Crossman came
from the Islanders to post a team-
worst -18. The Red Wings main
problem is goaltending. Tim
Cheveldae is the starter coming off a
poor year, so look for Glen Hanlon,
who has had previous playoff suc-
cess, to get some time.

EDGE: St. Louis in five.

Smythe Divisi

Vancouver Canucks ys.
Los Angeles Kings

The Kings, led by Number 99,
are coming off a division title and
look ready to unseat Calgary and
Edmonton as Smythe powerhouse.
Wayne Gretzky won his tenth scor-
ing title in the past twelve years, and
he appears ready to bring the Stanley
Cup to southern california. Thomas
Sanstrom, Luc Robitaille, and Tony
Granato lead the offense along with
the Great One. While the Smythe
Division is not known for defense,
the Kings boast a decent one. Rookie
Rob Blake had a good year, and
along with future Hall of Famer
Larry Robinson and tough-guy
Marty McSorley (+41) make up a
sufficient blue line. Goalie Kelly
Hrudy had a great year and is always
tough in April. Daniel Berthiaume is
a very capable backup.

Vancouver slipped past
Winnepeg for the last playoff spot

bly with Charlier losing 6-0, 6-3 to
All-American Roly Lamy at number
one, a match with which Lamy tied
his school’s all-time victory record,
bringing his overall record to 119-
41.

All in all it has been a busy two
weeks for the Bison men, who bring
their record to a solid 3-4. When
asked about the future of the squad,
Stenstrém replied, “The team will
come together soon. We’re still very
young and relatively inexperienced,
so as the season progresses and we
get more match experience under
our belts, our record should defi-
nitely improve.”

Other team members are also
hopeful about the remainder of the
season and see the team as talented
and full of potential. With the addi-
tion of all the young talent to the
team’s already deep roster of sea-
soned players, Charlier and Cantor
now agree that, “Not only are we one
of the strongest teams in the league,
but also the best looking.”

Softball player Heather Hoehn ’94 is selected Athlete of the Week
for her performances in the Lady Bison’s first fourteen games.

The first-baseman is batting .556 with a .778 slugging percentage.
She went 3-5 in Wednesday’s doubleheader sweep of St. Francis (Pa.)
with two doubles and two RBI. For the season she has three doubles, one

home run, and seven RBI.

The 9-4-1 Lady Bison travel to Worchester, MA for a double-
header against Holy Cross in their Patriot League opener tomorrow.

last week. A late season trade with
the Blues brought them Geoff
Courtnall - a very capable scorer.
Trevor Linden and Grey Adams are
the only two other real scorers for
Vancouver, however. The rest of the
team is made up of journeymen res-
cued off of other teams’ fourth lines
(ic. Tom Kurvers). Goalies Troy
Gamble, Kirk McLean and Bob Ma-
son are all fair.

EDGE: Los Angeles in a
sweep. Wouldn’t it be great to see a
Kelly Hrudey - Bob Mason matchup
in a reunion of sorts of the four
overtime game between the Caps
and Islanders a few years ago?

Edmonton Oilers vs.
Calgary Flames

This should be a great
matchup of the past two Stanley Cup
winners. Calgary is led by Theo
Fleury, Al MacInnis, Joe
Nieuwendyk, Doug Gilmour, and
Sergei Makarov in the scoring de-
partment. Gary Suter, Jamie
Macoun, and Ric Nattress trigger the
defense. Goalie Mike Vernon is one
of the best in the business - capable
of taking a team all the way. Rick
Wamsley could be the best backup
netminder in the league. Calgary is
motivated by their embarrassing
first-round loss to L.A. last year, and

mound, Fink tossed two one-hitters,
one being a shutout, while Nichols
had two two-hitters, also picking up
a shutout as well. Pitcher Michelle

first year coach Doug Risebrogh is a
good one.

Edmonton, the reigning
champ, had a miserable year. Their
-500 finish can be partially blamed
on Mark Messier’s injuries, but not
fully. The unidimentional Petr
Klima is the leading scorer, but Esa
Tikkanen can play both ways. Not
only is he one of the team’s leading
scorers, but he was responsible for
shutting down Gretzky in the second
round last year. Edmonton will be
relying heavily on the Kid Lien -
Adam Graves, 22, Joe Murphy, 22,
and Martin Gelinas, 20 - to repeat
last year’s successful playoffs. Vet-
eran Grant Fuhr is back in goal and
looking good, while Bill Ranford is
a solid workhouse.

While the rest of the campus
was off in sunny lands unknown
during Spring Break, the Bucknell
baseball team remained in “the
bubble” for the bulk of its 12-game
homestand.

On March 21, Bucknell hosted
Lock Haven. The Bison erased a 5-3
Lock Haven lead with a three-run
sixth inning which was capped off
by a Ted Obligato ‘91 double, plat-
ing the tying and go-ahead runs.

Denis Maguire ‘93 pitched
two scoreless innings in relief of
Mike Rizzi ‘93 (2-0) for his second

Jack Kazanjian ’93 (2-1)
started for Bucknell, and Dave
Koerner ‘92 (1 IP, 0 hits, 2 K’s)
picked up his second save. Koerner
took over for Brian Hildick ‘93 with
two on and no outs in the seventh.
He fanned the next two hitters and
retired the third on a groundout to
third.

Steve Gyimesi ‘93 led the of-
fense, going 2 for 3 with three RBI’s.
Mike Kearns ‘93 had two hits and
scored three runs, and SUNY-
Binghampton helped out with four
errors of its own

Game two was never in any
doubt as Bucknell jumped out to a 6-
0 lead after four innings. Obligato

save of the year. Bucknell scored
single runs in each of the first two
innings, but then saw Lock Haven
record four unearned runs in the
third with a walk, an error, and five
singles.

Mark Kennedy ‘92 of the Bi-
son doubled in a run in the fifth to
make it 4-3, but Lock Haven retali-
ated with one of its own in the top of
the sixth. Its lead disappeared in the
bottom of the frame on Obligato’s
clutch stroke.

SUNY-Binghampton was the
next opponent to visit Lewisburg, on
March 25, and the players probably
wished they had stayed in New
York. The Bison swept a double-
header, winning game one 10-7 and
the nightcap 7-2.

hit his first home run of the year, and
Kennedy and Matt Sniegocki ‘93
doubled. Dan Krewson ‘91 and Scott
Gerhardt ‘94 each pitched well.
Krewson allowed just two runs on
three hits in five innings, while
Gerhardt pitched two no-hit innings
in relief.

On March 27, Misericordia
came to town. This one also worked
out well, as Bucknell pounded
Misericordia starter Kevin Villa for
nine runs on ten hits through five in-
nings.

Roger Ahrens ‘91 had a big
day for the Bison, going 2 for 3 with
a homer, two RBIs and two runs
scored, Shortstop Bill Rinker ‘92
had two hits and three RBIs and
Obligato had a double and two RBI.

SPORTS
Bison victorious in five of last seven

Yesterday's tie against St. Bonaventure and Tuesday’s 8-6 win over William Patterson push record to 10-4-1

This game marked the mound
return of Kurt Waldner ‘93, last
year’s ace who had been out of ac-
tion with arm problems. Waldner
started and pitched three innings,
giving up one unearned run on four
hits, striking out two. Rick Heller
“94 (three no-hit innings) and Jim
Stevens ‘94 (3 IP, 1 run, 3 hits, 4
K’s) each pitched well in relief.

The next day, LeMoyne
played here and ended the Bison’s
four game winning streak. LeMoyne
showed off its lumber in this one,
pounding out a 12-10 win. Pitchers
Rizzi and Maguire were rocked for
12 runs on 15 hits. Neither of them
could figure out LeMoyne
rightfielder Chuck Kulle, who had a
five hit afternoon, including a double
and a triple.

Ed Gay homered in the fourth
for the visitors, triggering a 10-run
onslaught in the middle innings.
Shoddy defense by Bucknell also
hurt. Three errors resulted in three
unearned runs, the difference in the
game.

The Bison wasted a solid of-
fensive effort in this contest, getting
16 hits in the game (six for extra
bases), with six players getting at
least two. Rinker homered and
doubled, and Koerner had three hits
to lead the attack. Kearns, Obligato,
Ahrens, and Larry Trout ‘93 also had
two hits apiece.

Rinker was named Patriot
League Player of the Week. He went
5 for 10 with his first home run of
the year, four RBI’s, and four runs
scored.

This past Tuesday, Bucknell
hosted William Paterson College.
The Bison got out to a 6-2 lead , and
held on for an 8-6 victory. After
Mark Kennedy’s RBI single in the
first inning and Rinker’s RBI
groundout in the second, Bucknell
exploded for four in the third.

In the inning Obligato and
Ahrens singled to start it off. Back-
to-back doubles by Kennedy and
Gyimesi brought runs in, and two
groundouts later, Gyimesi scored the
fourth run of the inning.

Kennedy finished the day go-
ing 3 for 4 with three RBI and two
runs scored. Koerner singled and
triple in four at bats, and Sniegocki
also had two hits.

Meanwhile, Koerner is estab-
lishing himself as one of the best
relief pitchers in the league. He
pitched the final 1 1/3 innings in this
game for his third save of the year.

Women’s lacrosse starts

By Eliza Wampler

With six games under their
belt, the Women’s Lacrosse team
has begun their season only 1-5, yet
they have shown signs of strong play
and improved levels of skill and
confidence. The opponents that the
stick gals have faced thus far have
been strong and competitive, pre-
paring the team for an intense sched-
ule ahead.

The Women dropped their
fifth game yesterday at home to
Towson State. The game began
competitively as the teams were
deadlocked at five early in the sec-
ond half. But the Bison just
crumpled as Tigers scored the next
seven goals before defeating Buck-
nell 19-6. Julie Goeller ‘91 led the
way with a couple of goals while
Dorie Lynn Ellwood ‘92, Kristina
Haas ‘91, Jen Kehoe ‘94, and Lynn
Santilli ‘91 each scored once. Leslie
Why ‘91 played in her first game
since injuring her ankle in the season
opener and responded with an assist.

The lacrosse ladies opened
their season March 17th with a tough
defeat by fierce competitor, Loyola,
17-4. The first half rattled the Lady
Bison, as Loyola dominated. During
the second half, however, the Buck-
nell attack became more successful
with more shots on goal and the de-
fense was able to hold Loyola’s of-
fensive force. Scoring for Bucknell
were Ellwood, Sue Wells ‘93, Trisha
Way ‘94 and Kehoe .

Shippensburg was the next

competitor that the Lady Bison
battled, but they were defeated 12-
11 in a strong and exciting game.
Head Coach Jennifer Averill com-
mented, “That is the type of game I
love to see. My players remained
strong the entire game, keeping
Shippensburg in complete control.”
Single goals were scored by Wells,
Goeller and Santilli. Kehoe added
three goals while Ellwood had five
goals in the loss.

Thus far, the highlight of the
ladies’ season was the game against
Patriot League rival Holy Cross. The

Bisons took control of the game im-
mediately, showing great skill and
aggression winning 14-2. Kehoe,
Way, Goeller, Haas, Allison Arth
“93, Jill Schuyler ‘93, and Sarah
Walker ‘94 each contributed one
goal for the Bison. Sue Signori ‘93
and Wells each contributed two,
while Ellwood fired in three. “It was
nice to get a victory in so early in the
season. It has given the team the
confidence they need to be success-
ful in the future,” Averill com-
mented.

The team has just returned

Outfielder Steve Gyimesi ’93 legs out an infield single during last Tuesday’s 8-6 defeat of William
Patterson at home. Gyimesi, who has been hampered by a pulled hamstring muscle, carried a five-game
hitting streak into yesterday’s game at St. Bonaventure.

loaded and the .405-hitting Keith
Eaddy up for William Patterson,
Koerner got the slugger to fly out to
center, then threw a scoreless ninth
to close out the win.

In his four appearences this
year, Koemer has yet to give up arun
in seven innings, and he has allowed
only one hit all year. Jack Kazanjian
(3-1) started for the Bison, and
Maguire, Waldner, Ahrens, and
Koerner all pitched in relief.

The leading hitters for the Bi-
son entering the William Patterson
game were Kearns (.357), Rinker
(.344), Jim Zervanos ’92 (.344),
Trout (.326), Gyimesi (.320), and
Ahrens (.302). Ahrens also leads the
team with three home runs and 14
RBI. Kearns and Trout lead the team
with 15 hits, and Kearns has a team-
high 17 runs scored.

As for the pitchers, Koerner
had an impressive 0.00 ERA to lead
the staff into yesterday’s game at St.
Bonaventure. Stevens (1.59), Rizzi
(4.50), and Krewson (5.63) follow.
Kazanjian now leads the team with
three wins.

Yesterday, Bucknell and St.

slowly

from a spring trip to Virginia, where
they met Old Dominion University
and the University of Richmond.
They were defeated by both, 15-7
and 11-6, respectively, but still
played well during the Richmond
game. Goalie Kahra Foster ‘92 was
exceptional in the net, making 18
saves against Richmond.

Averill’s outlook on the sea-
son is a very positive one, as she
feels that the team this year shows a
great amount of depth, strength, and
a positive morale. “The team is
combining very well. I have a very
strong freshman class, and many
experienced returning players.” Her
expectations are very high for her
players, as she sees enormous
amounts of potential in each one.
Ellwood has been the core of lead-
ership on the offensive end, as she
has scored 11 goals and added seven
assists, displaying what Averill de-
scribed as “aggressive, finessed, and
very agile play.” Kehoe has also
been dangerous as she has scored ten
goals to go along with four assists.
At midfield, there is an enormous
amount of speed, which is a huge
asset to the team. Arth, Way, and
Signori are dominant in this area.
Why and Haas help with the unity
and leadership on the field, as they
both possess an enormous amount of
skill and poise.

Tomorrow, the lady lacrosse
players will be facing Patriot League
rival Lafayette at home in an attempt
to stretch their record to 2-0 in the
conference.

Bonaventure played to an 11-inning
5-5 tie in Odean. The game was
called prior to the 12th because of
darkness. The Bison led 4-3 with
two out in the bottom of the ninth,
but Jon Phillips hit an opposite field
home run for the Bonies off Koerner,
who had come on in the eighth in re-
lief. It was the first run he had al-
lowed this year

In the 11th, the Bison took a
5-4 lead as Brian Walter ‘94 singled,
went to second on a sacrifice by
Rinker and scored on Koerner’s
triple. Bucknell could have scored
more, but Ahrens‘ shot to the wall
was snagged Willie Mays-style by
John Boccieri.

St. Bonaventure tied the score
up in the home half of the inning,
Don Farrance walked, moved to
second on a sacrifice, went to third
ona single, and scored on a Phillip’s

sacrifice fly.

Bucknell’s record now stands
at 10-4-1. The Bison open up Patriot
League play with a doubleheader at
Holy Cross, followed by a single
game there on Sunday. Holy Cross
is led by Coach Jack Whalen, who
returns seven starters and the entire
pitching staff from last year‘s 17-13
club.

“Around the Horn” as

Atlanta Braves farm system, un-
derwent shoulder surgery and may

have six-game hitting streaks...

homered so far this season. )

Tennis returns home after
splitting its four matches

By Mike Markovich

The men’s tennis team re-
turned to Bucknell Sunday after its
annual spring break trip to Florida
during which it went 2-2 against
some very diverse and competitive
schools.

The Bison made quick work of
their first two opponents of the week,
Aurora University of Illinois on
Saturday the 23rd and Florida's
Barry University the following day.
The Aurora squad proved to be no
match for the deep Bison team, who
shut them out in nine straight set
matches in which the only Aurora
opponent to win more than one game
was their number-two doubles
brother combination of Dave and
Jeff Bongiouno.

Their match against
Bucknell’s number-two duo, An-
drew Cantor *92 and and Greg
Downing ’94, ended in a 6-1, 6-2
score. At number-three doubles,
Scott Bank ’91 and Chris Rimpel
*93, were relentless in a 6-0, 6-0
thrashing of Aurora’s Jared Bebar
and Ed Zabelin. Jerome Charlier *92
and Cris Stenstrém *94 disposed of
Mike Walton and Jeff Thomas 6-0,
6-1 at the number-one spot.

In singles action, three of the
six matches ended in 6-0, 6-0 scores,
with Cantor, Rimpel, and Downing
downing their foes at numbers three,
five, and six, respectively. Charlier,
continuing at number one singles,
and Bank, at number four, won by 6-
0, 6-1 margins. Stenstrém was vic-
torious at number two, 6-1, 6-0.

The team from Barry Univer-
sity posed little more of a challenge
for the Bison on Sunday. No match
went into a third set, and the final
score of 6-2 reflected singles losses

by Charlier and Bruno Barbera °94,
at the number one and three spots,
respectively. Charlier lost both his
sets by tough 7-6 scores to Barry’s
Todd Rubenstein, while Barbera put
up less of a fight during his 6-4, 6-3
match. Bucknell chalked up victo-
ries in the remaining singles
matches, with Stenstrém winning 6-
4, 6-3, while Cantor, Bank, and
Rimpel again demonstrated the
team’s depth with decisive victories
at the four, five, and six spots, losing
only six games between them.

The number-one doubles
match was cancelled due to the
length of Charlicr’s singles match,
denying Barry the opportunity to
avoid a Bucknell doubles sweep as
Barbera and Cantor won 7-6, 6-3 at
number two. Bank and Downing
followed suit at number three, easily
winning 6-1, 6-1 to complete the
second of Bucknell’s victories on the
trip.

From there, the trip took a turn
for the worse, as the Bison moved
north from the Miami setting of the
first two matches to Boca Raton for
the final two. There they met up
with two tough teams, Florida At-
lantic and the local College of Boca
Raton. Both matches ended in 6-3
defeats.

The only bright spots for the
Bison on Wednesday the 27th, the
date of their battle with the College
of Boca Raton, were singles victo-
ties for Barbera at number three,
Cantor at four, and a default victory
for Rimpel at number six. Barbera
took his match 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), Cantor
7-6 (8-6), 6-3. Charlier and
Stenstrém each went down 6-0, 6-1
in their singles matches and lost 6-2,

jeans Day spcirks controversy

First Amendment rights surround issue

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Jeans Day, originally sched-
uled to be a day of support for the
rights of homosexuals and bi-
sexuals, has become entangled in
controversy by the establishment of
the first annual Bucknell “Hetero-
sexual Pride Day.”

Evan Maloney 94, head of the
Ad Hoc Committee for Heterosexual
Awareness, explained that he estab-
lished the day because he “always
wanted a vehicle to expose how the
left-wing groups work on campus.
We figured that Jeans Day would be
a vehicle to expose their tactics.”
According to Maloney, “We have
fifty people pledged to wear ties and
skirts (respectively).”

The group posted fliers around
campus which Maloney says
“someone took... and added the tag
line FAG (Friends of anti-gays)...
Then the people from POWER
(Partnership of Women Engaged in
Revolution) tore down our signs, so
we printed more, and they were torn
down again.” After this, Maloney
and other members of the ad hoc
committee “did a chalk talk, and
POWER defaced that which we
thought was pretty hypocritical be-
cause these were the same groups al-
legedly fighting for the right to be
heard.”

A representative of POWER
described incidents differently. The
representative denied knowledge of
tearing down posters, but did say

Bio building construction
on schedule, under budget

By David Murray
Staff Writer

After four months of planning
and nearly a year of construction,
both the new biology building, and
the atrium connecting it to the chem-
istry building, are ncaring comple-
tion. The project is “within schedule,
and we expect it will come in under
budget,” according to Barry Max-
well, vice president for administra-
tion.

“If things continue to go as
planned, and that’s a big if, we

should be in the building for the fall
semester,” said Jack Harclerode,
professor of biology and head of the
building’s design committee. In the
event problems do occur, “classes
will start in Taylor and the move-
ment of the biology department will
occur during the semester at a
schedule set by the department,”
Maxwell said.

The $12 million, 65,000
square foot biology building is part
of the second phase of a three-phase
plan to create a state-of-the-art sci-
ence complex. Phase one involved

the construction of the chemistry
building and the renovation of the
Olin science building, and phase two
will conclude with the renovation of
Taylor Hall and the botany building.

Construction is progressing
extremely smoothly, and both Max-
well and Harclerode credit the “good
working team of owner, architect,
and contractor” with that success.
The architect of the biology building
also designed the chemistry building
and the renovations of Olin Science,

Faculty opposes incinerator

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

The Bucknell faculty voted
unanimously to approve a motion
opposing the proposed Gregg
Township hazardous waste incin-
erator. By passing the motion pro-
posed by Jeffrey Evans, associate
professor of civil engineering, the
faculty joins over 130 local govem-
ment organizations, corporations
and other groups who have voiced
their opposition to the project.

In explaining his motion,
which stated that “the Bucknell fac-

ulty goes on record against the siting
of a hazardous waste incinerator in
Gregg Township,” Evans delineated
several negative effects of the incin-
erator, among them its effect on
Bucknell’s ability to attract students.
Noting that many students come to
Bucknell from urban areas because
of the area’s beauty, he said the in-
cinerator “could have a direct impact
on us.”

Evans also pointed out the
danger that “the presence of the in-
cinerator could bring the area to be
an epicenter of dirty industry,” since
the presence of the incinerator and

the nearby Lycoming County land-
fill may attract other waste proces-
sors. Finally, he addressed the ques-
tion “Do we need it somewhere?” by
asserting that “building the incin-
erator provides a cheap alternative,
and creates a disincentive” for recy-
cling and waste reduction programs.

Larry Shinn, vice president for
academic affairs, addressed the
concers surrounding the transport
of the hazardous waste, asking,
“even if one accepts the premise”
that the technology is safe “how does

that her group went out last Sunday
to do their own chalk-writing when
they saw the writings from the ad
hoc committee of heterosexual
awareness. The representative ex-
plained that they felt they had to “re-
spond to the hate that they are per-
petuating or trying to create.” Ad-
ditionally, she noted that the events

were “effective, because it was actu-
ally a dialogue.”

Maloney asserted that “we
exposed them for what they were.
They are not for free speech, they are
for their speech, ‘politically correct’
speech.” He explained that since the
first two attempts at publicizing
Heterosexual Awareness Day were

unsuccessful, he resorted to printing
an announcement in “What's Hap-
pening.”

The announcement was taken
to Mary Dorsey, acting associate
dean of student life, who explained
that “there was never any doubt that
we would print it because it did not

Faculty debates PELL grants

By Travis Elliott
Staff Writer

On Monday, the Bucknell fac-
ulty reconsidered its earlier decision
to counteract a federal drug policy
which denies PELL grants to college
students convicted of drug viola-
tions. Dean Baker, assistant profes-
sor of economics and author of the
original motion, claimed that the
federal government's policy dis-
criminates against lower-income
students, who qualify for the grants.

The issue came to the floor
when Charles Longley, professor of
political science, introduced a re-
consideration of Baker’s motion
which was passed by the faculty in
February. Baker contends that the
federal policy is discriminatory be-
cause it requires only students re-
ceiving PELL grants, a form of fed-
eral tuition assistance, to sign a
pledge affirming that they will not
use illegal drugs. He argued that
lower-income students, who may not
be able to attend Bucknell without
the aid, are forced to accept an ad-
ditional requirement that other stu-
dents are not. Losing this assistance
could force disadvantaged students
to leave Bucknell, while other stu-
dents could remain after a similar
drug offense. In addition, the federal

TIP, the Trustee Implementa
tion Program, which began almost a
year ago, is nearing its final stages.
By the end of this semester, Presi-
dent Gary Sojka is expected to an-
nounce the final recommendations
by the TIP committees for imple-
menting changes in social and resi-
dential life at Bucknell.

Charlotte Weddle, associate
vice president for student life, de-
scribed the recommendations as “a
Bucknell plan for a better Bucknell.”
Although many students may see the
plan as being exclusively aimed at
the Greek system, Weddle says it is
“more holistic than Greck issues”
and is meant to cover all areas of
social and residential life.

When asked how significant
the impact of TIP will be on the
Bucknell community, Dave Skena
’92, co-chair of the steering com-
mittee for TIP, said that “changes
will be substantial, but once people
get used to them, they will be toler-
able.” He also said that there should
be “no surprises” when the president
makes his final announcement.
However, he is afraid that some
changes may be delayed because of
budget constraints.

The history of TIP is a long
and complex one. It began last
spring when the trustees gave Presi-
dent Sojka a list of recommendations
for restructuring the social/residen-
tial community at Bucknell. These
changes were to be made in five ar-
eas, including the Greek system,
residential and social life, the fresh-
man year experience, and a four-year
residency requirement.

Weddle and Skena, then-
president of Bucknell Student Gov-
emment, recommended to President
Sojka that task teams be formed to
deal with each of the five areas.
Toward this end, an open meeting
took place last fall, where members
of the Bucknell community, includ-
ing students, faculty, administrators,

and become members the task teams.
TIP guidelines were drawn up,
committees were formed, and chair-
persons for each committee were
chosen, all of whom are students.

project, the main function of which,

contain anything offensive in the
‘fighting words’ mode.” Dorsey
added, “Any person has a right to
publish... in What's Happening. 1
would have published a message
from FAG; we're not in the business
of censoring.”

Dorsey did contend however,
that, “we are in the business of sen-
sitizing. I find the whole thing that
is happening in the way of intoler-
ance on college campuses very up-
setting. We continue to try to help
students and others understand the
importance of accepting others and
diversity... because a lot of people
come upon their first experince of
racism, sexism, or homophobia in
college.”

Dorsey’s only regret about the
Heterosexual Pride Day is that, “I
wish they were not on the same day
because there’s room for both view-
points.”

Molly Swart °92, a trained
peer educator for homophobia, re-
sponded to the Heterosexual Pride
Day saying, “It’s obvious why
they’re having this day on Jeans
Day. It scares me that these indi-
viduals feel threatened by Jeans Day
This day is not to attack or threaten
Swart continued
yy explaining that “this week is
probably the best example of the
{widespread problem of homo-
phobia]. It’s pretty well-known that
there is not a safe environment for
homosexuals on the campus, or even
for people involved in things like
FLAG.”

Swart conceded that part of
this problem arises from ignorance

eterosexuality.”

“There are mis-

conceptions on what the support is
for; it’s for people of different sexual
orientations that deserve rights. So
when people wear jeans, they're not
necessarily supporting homosexual-
ity and bi-sexuality; they are sup-

Porting people who deserve the same |

rights as heterosexuals.”

The meaning of Jeans Day has
caused confusion within the Chris-
tian community. Dick Wiedenheft
*92, an executive committee mem-
ber of Intervarsity Christian Fellow-
ship, said, “I don’t think it’s clear to
everyone what it means to wear
jeans.” Wiedenheft who wanted it
made clear that he does not “repre-
sent anyone other than myself and
hopefully God,” predicted that a
representative segment of
Intervarsity would “wear jeans anda
Christian tee-shirt.”

Wiedenheft explained that his
dilemma revolves around “Loving
the sinner but hating the sin. That

pretty much sums it up... The Bible §

makes it clear that whatever the ori-
entation, homosexual acts are
wrong, that it is detestable for a man
to lie with a man like he would lie
with a woman.” On the other hand,
Wicdenheft thinks, “You can do it if
you want to, you have the freedom
to do it, but I think it is wrong.”

In addition to the issue of het-
erosexual pride, Maloney thinks that
free speech has become a more im
portant issue in the context of Jeans
Day. “We’re not against homo
sexuals, but we are for heterosexu
als. It’s more an issue of speech than
of sexual preference... By not using
our voice, we allow these fascist
notions such as ‘politically correct
speech’ to gain power... I think that
one of the scariest things is this ‘po

Nursing service | University departments

By Bob Minnich
Staff Writer

Responding to the changing
nature of university health care
and to the declining number of
evening visits by students, the
Student Medical Service will no
longer provide 24-hour nursing
coverage. Instead, nurses will be
available weekdays from 8 a.m. to
8 p.m. The schedule changes will
take effect beginning next semes-
ter,

Characterizing the changes
in health care, Dr. J. Preston
Hoyle, director of Student Medi-
cal Services, said that “over the
past ten years we’ ve become more
proactive.” Outreach programs
and preventative measures are
now more a part of the medical
service’s goals. Freshman hall
talks on sexually transmitted dis-
eases, AIDS educators, drug and
alcohol peer educators, and bro-
chures covering health and dietary
habits attempt to make the Buck-
nell community safer and
healthier.

As part of proactive medi-
cine, Hoyle said “we would love
to have a health educator” to co-
ordinate and expand programs.
Acco: ding to a survey of 16 other
universities done by Student
Medical Services, 13 of the
schools had such an office within
their medical care facilities.

Since funding for a similar
position is unlikely at Bucknell,
Hoyle stated that the scheduling
change for the nursing staff will
“free one of the nurses who has an
interest in health education.” The
new position of Health Care/Staff
Nurse will cover both nursing and
health care programs without an
overall increase in the person’s
working hours.

The medical services staff
now conducts educational pro-
grams on their own time after
working hours.

According to Hoyle, the
part-time health educator “will
improve the programs we already
have in place and will be able to
set up new programs,” as well as
coordinate preventative instruc-
tion,

Another reason for the chang
in staffing hours is the increased us'
of the emergency room at Evangeli.
cal Community Hospital. Despit
efforts to inform students that medi.
cal care is available 24 hours fro
the medical service, students use thi
hospital’s emergency room fo
health problems not limited solely
emergencies. As a result, Studen
Medical Services has averaged on
student visit every two nights ove:
the last several years. Hoyle at
tributes this to students being un
aware that a nurse is on dut
throughout the night and becaus:
some students wish to see a docto:
rather than a nurse.

Hoyle also stated that in orde:
to cover the necessary hours nurses
work split shifts totalling 46 hour:
per week. Medical services is “fac:
ing the issue of hiring new nurse:
over the next several years,” an
with a national nursing shortage th
present schedule places Bucknell ai
a competitive disadvantage in at
tracting new nurses.

The proposed change in staf
hours and safety was discussed wi
the offices of Student Life, Residen
tial Life and Security, as well as th
Student Medical Services adviso
board. The board is composed pri
marily of students. Finally, the pro
posed change was submitted t
President Gary Sojka through Stu:
dent Life.

Under the current schedule
nursing care is provided daily fro
8 a.m. to 10 p.m. with a nurse o1
duty from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. fo
emergencies. Nursing coverage is

provided by four general duty nurses

and one head nurse/administrativ
assistant. During the day, two o
three nurses are on duty, while on

nurse remains at medical services

between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. Hoyl
added that the present schedul
worked until Student Medical Ser

vices began to focus on more
proactive medicine.

Beginning in September,
students with emergencies after
hours will be referred to Evangeli-
cal Hospital’s emergency room. A
Bucknell doctor will remain on-
call with the emergency room
doctor as is necessary.

Free AIDS testing

extended two days

By Bob Minnich
Staff Writer

Response to the free and anonymous AIDS testing offered at Stu-

dent Medical Services has been “somewhat overwhelming” according to
Dr. J. Preston Hoyle, director of Student Medical Services. Blood tests
will be offered April 18 and April 25. Originally, only one testing date,

April 9, was offered.

Hoyle attributes the overwhelming campus interest to the personal
questionnaire sponsored by the AIDS task force, Friends of Lesbians and
Gays (FLAG), and the medical center.

“You cannot throw condoms at the AIDS problem,” added Hoyle.
Awareness through peer educators and other outreach programs needs to
be part of the solution. Testing is part of that awareness.

A soaring increase in the cost
of subscriptions forced Ann de
Klerk, director of library services, to
announce at Monday’s faculty
meeting the need for academic de-
partments to cut back their requests
for subscriptions for next year. With
only a nine percent increase in its
operating budget, part of a series of
budgetary limitations set upon the
University, the library will have to
reduce its number of subscriptions to
account for a 15 percent rise in rates.

The library’s cuts are part of a
much wider attempt to limit the
budget. In November, the Board of
Trustees opted for a 4.5 percent in-
crease in the comprehensive fee for
students as opposed to the 6.7 per-
cent increase recommended by the
finance and planning committee.

“The library has to try to hold
the line just like any other depart-
ment, so they look at their entire
budget and make decisions as to
what they can cut,” said Barry
Maxwell, vice president of adminis-
tration.

Several faculty members
voiced concern at the faculty meet-
ing, claiming the library’s decision
to cut periodicals would hurt their
programs. But, according to Michael
Moohr, chairman of the faculty fi-
nance and planning committee, “A
good portion of the faculty thought
it wasn’t an altogether bad idea, that
it really forced us to go through each
departmental program and re-exam-
ine carefully our list of journals to
see the ones we really could do
without.”

The library reductions are the
most recent of the cuts made across
campus. “The trustees, because of
the existence of the recession, be-
came convinced that Bucknell had to

minimize its comprehensive fee in-
crease, and to get the increase down
to the level they wanted we had to
cut real expenditures,” explained
Moohr.

Moohr explained that fears of
the national recession’s effects on
the University prompted trustees to
approve the 4.5 percent increase.
“They felt that given the recession,

Seen

Because 80 percent of the
University’s funds come from the
comprehensive fee, an increase of
only 4.5 percent made it necessary
for the President’s Council to deter-
mine what cuts and budgetary limi-
tations could be made for the 1991-
92 school year. “Institutionally
we’re not making cuts. We’re not
cutting back on any particular class
of expansion,” Maxwell said.

But the President’s Council
did determine the need to limit the
amount of money spent both within
different areas of operation and in
capital allocations. The University
will delay renovations to residence
halls which had been tentatively
scheduled to begin this summer.

Each year the Council devel-
ops a capital projects priority list,

In addition, limitations will
include a reduced increase in all de-
partments’ operating budgets. On
average, each department will be
allowed an increase in its operating
budget of no more than two percent,
rather than a “conventional, cus-
tomary 4.5 or five percent” increase,
said Maxwell.

Because of an inflation rate of
4.5 percent, an increase of two per.
cent will result in real reductions for
departmental operations. “Every
area of the University is affected-
psych services, student health, ath-
letics, academic departments, the
administration, the residence life,”
said Moohr. “Assuming the rate of
inflation is 4.5 percent, all of us will
experience a 2.5 percent reduction in

Radon concentration levels
no longer dangerously high

By David Murray
Staff Writer

Radon, a radioactive, carcino-
genic gas, is no longer found in
dangerous levels anywhere on cam-
pus. Jim McCormick, safety man-
ager, has directed a $5,000 effort
over three years to locate and re-
move all radon hazards.

According to “A Citizen’s
Guide to Radon,” a pamphlet dis-
tributed by several federal agencies,
“Radon is a gas which can move
through small spaces in the soil and
rock on which a house is built. Ra-
don can seep into a home through
dirt floors, cracks in concrete floors
and walls, floor drains, sumps,
joints, and tiny cracks or pores in
hollow-block walls.”

The Office of Security and
Safety began a campus radon testing
program in 1988, headed by
McCormick. “Our goal,” he said,
“was to test the residence halls for
the presence of radon gas.”

Since radon is created under-
ground, basement areas are most
susceptible to contamination. Thus,
he said, “we followed and exceeded
the Environmental Protection

Agency’s [EPA] guidelines for ra-
don testing by testing the lowest
level of every building, where the
gas is most dense.” EPA guidelines
only require testing of the lowest
occupied level of a building.

Concentrations of radon gas
are reported as a number of
“picocuries per liter” (pCi/l) be-
tween 0 and 200. A reading of 4 pCi/
l is considered the EPA’s ‘action
level’ and may be dangerous.
Readings at or below 4 pCi/ are not
harmful and generally cannot be
corrected.

Following McCormick’s
original testing, only five residence
halls were found to have radon con-
centrations above 4 pCi/l. Those
halls are Harris, Roser, Kalman-
Posner, Swartz D-wing basement,
and the East basement of Roberts
Hall. The highest level of radon
contamination found was 9 pCi/1.

“After confirming those read-
ings, following EPA guidelines, we
started remedial work in those ar-
eas,” McCormick said. Such work
was begun in November 1990.

The radon leaking into Harris,
Roser, and Kalman—Posner Halls
was stopped when cracks in the floor

and around the foundation were
caulked and sealed. Radon seepage
was also stopped in the Swartz D
wing basement when the mechanical
air handling system was correctly
balanced. The return air ducts had
been pulling radon out of the ground
and blowing it into the room.

The source of radon in the East
basement of Roberts Hall was harder
to pinpoint. Eventually, however,
“We found, with extensive testing by
environmental consultants, that the
entrance of radon gas was through a
pipe chase in the ground under the
East wing basement” according to
McCormick.

The problem was corrected
when “we sealed off the end of the
chase and installed a mechanical air
system that draws radon gas out of
the pipe chase and dispels it out-
side.”

Roberts was the last residence
hall to be treated for radon gas con-
tamination, and the remedial action
there was completed in February,
1991. “Our goals were very clearly
set—right from the beginning,”
McCormick concluded, “I’m very
pleased with how the program
went.”

do the jobs that we were hired to do.”

Two percent will be the aver-
age increase in a department’s oper-
ating budget. The operating budgets
for some departments will increase
above the two percent average. One
example is the library which will
increase its operating budget by nine
percent, still not enough to combat
increasing subscription rates. “Even
with that nine percent increase in the
library budget we still have to make
absolute cuts in the number of jour-
nals and books purchased because
they’re inflating at a rate that far ex-
ceeds nine percent year after year,”
said Moohr.

Another example, the finan-
cial aid office will operate according
to a budget increased by 13.5 per-
cent. “That means we’re doing real
butchering elsewhere,” said Moohr.
To counter increases above two
percent by operations such as the li-
brary and financial aid, other depart-
ments’ operating budgets will not
increase at all.

According to Moohr, budget-
ary limitations enforced for the
coming year will have no lasting ef-
fect on the University, although, if
the limitations are part of a trend to-
wards reduced spending, the Uni-
versity would have to completely re-
work its allocation of money, he
said

“We can live with these bud-
get cuts for one year, tightening our
belts. The real question is, ‘Is this
going to be part of a long-term pat-
tern?’... If that happens, I think it will
move us into a much weaker com-
petitive position,” Moohr said.

But Moohr doesn’t foresee
such a trend, stating that most trust-
ces are pleased to see Bucknell be-
come a more competitive institution.

The budget revisions became
necessary after the trustees opted for
a 4.5 percent increase in the com-
prehensive fee as opposed to the 6.7
percent increase Moohr’s committee
proposed. According to Maxwell,
three factors influenced the trustees:
a concern the national
economy, changing student demo-
graphics, and price sensitivity

Maxwell said, “I think those
same reasons that existed in No-
vember are still valid concems.”

According to Moohr, these
three factors are strong arguments in
favor of increasing the comprehen-
sive fee. If the national economy
does cause lay-offs, it will reduce the
number of students who can afford
to go to Bucknell. “That’s all the
more reason to have a higher com-
prehensive fee to make up for those
lost revenues,” he noted.

Moohr also pointed out that
despite major reductions in appli-
cants to frame of reference schools,
Bucknell’s applicant pool has re-
mained stable. The number of ap-
plicants for the incoming freshman
class is down by 30 people from last
year’s class. On average, Bucknell
receives 6,000 applications.

Committees reevaluate sexual assault policies

By Joyce Dollinger

At Monday’s faculty meeting
Janice Butler, director of the
Women’s Resource Center, intro-
duced a new proposal for dealing
with cases of sexual assault. Butler
represented the. Committee on Re-
spect and Equality (CRE) by intro-
ducing a proposal which the group
hopes will serve as an interim policy
later to be incorporated into a revised
University disciplinary and judicial
system, which is currently being re-
viewed by the Committee to Review
Conduct Regulations.

According to Butler, “This
matter was brought to the faculty’s
attention so that they would be aware
of suggested changes and have an
opportunity to offer feedback to

President Sojka.” Sojka suggested
that faculty should respond by April
24.

In addition, Butler said that
she and Arlyne Hoyt, director of
Psychological Services, originally
Proposed the policy to Sojka because
they feel existing policy is insuffi-
cient in handling assaulted students.
“Because of our experiences in
dealing with students who have been
sexually assaulted by acquaintances
or raped by dates, we feel a change
from current practice is advisable,”
said Butler.

The proposal which Butler in-
troduced to the faculty was one of
two similar policies being discussed
by organizations on campus. The
other proposal which was, written
by the Committee on Complemen-

tary Activities (CCA), presents
slightly different alternatives to the
proposal drafted by CRE.

The CRE proposal and the
CCA draft differ on several points.
For example, the CRE advocates that
the committee designated to hear
sexual assault cases include only
three members. CCA recommends a
committee of five.

Both groups agree that the se-
lected panel should benefit from
psychological training so the group
will be “smooth, efficient, fair and
sensitive to the alleged victim’s
rights as well as for the accused,”
said Rick Gatteau °92, chair of CCA.

CCA has not completed its fi-
nal amended draft of the CRE pro-
posal. “We want to cover every
angle of the proposal before we

makc it final,” said Gatteau.

However, in her presentation
to the faculty, Butler introduced a
few of CCA’s suggestions along
with the presentation of her own
committee’s proposal.

CRE, a committee of staff,
faculty and students, was the first
group to initiate discussion con-
cering the handling of sexual as-
sault cases on campus.

The committee, formed by
Charlotte Weddle, associate vice
president for student life, deemed it
necessary “to make it more acces-
sible to students who had been vic-
timized.”

CRE presented its proposal to
Sojka in February. Sojka.then sub-
mitted it to CCA, which began to
review and revise the proposal.

U.S. begins aid
to fleeing Kurds

After extensive pressure,
President Bush ordered Air Force
officers to begin giving aid to thou-
sands of Kurds fleeing Iran and
Turkey. At least 1,500 refugees
have already died trying to reach
Turkey, and tension has risen in-
tensely between the refugees and
soldiers protecting their borders.

Six U.S. Cargo planes left
Turkish air bases to distribute sup-
plies to Kurdish refugees. Among
the items sent were packaged meals,
medical supplies, and bottled water.
President Bush also plans to donate
$869,000 to the United relief funds
to aid victims of the Persian Gulf
War. The International Red Cross
will also be given $131,000 and
1,000 tons of food by the United
States.

Since Iraq invaded Kuwait in
August, Washington has contributed
$35 million to internal organization
to assist refugees. Britain, France,
Germany, and Switzerland are
among other countries sending sup-
plies to help the Kurds.

restoration plan

President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev presented and “anti-cri-

all-union Parliament, as the Soviet
Union nears economic failure and an
stagnation of power. Gorbachev’s
plan demands restoration of the chair
of authority and a delay on strikes
and demonstrations for the duration
of the one-year program.

While Gorbachev focused on
restoring discipline to the economy
and the society at the expense of the
democracy, he basically avoided

Ryan to lecture
on Holocaust

Allan Ryan, Jr., university at-
tomey at Harvard, professor of hu-
man rights law at Boston College
Law School, and former director for
the Office of Special Investigations
with the U.S. Justice Department is
scheduled to give a lecture on “Nazi
War Criminals in America: Legal
Issues, Moral Issues” during Buck-
nell University’s annual Holocaust
Memorial program.

Ryan is a graduate of
Dartmouth College and the Univer-
sity of Minnesota Law School,
where he was President of the Min-
nesota Law Review. From 1980 to
1983, he served as the Director of the
Justice Department's newly created
Office of Special Investigations
where he lead the investigation and
prosecution of Nazi war criminals in
America. In 1988, Ryan presented
the case against Kurt Waldheim be-
fore the International Commission of
Inquiry, and was featured in the
1989 Academy Award-winning
documentary, “Hotel Terminus: The
Life and Times of Klaus Barbie.”

He has received honors from
both Yad Vashem and President
Reagan, attaining the title of
Meritoriuos Executive from the lat-
ter. The lecture will take place on

Tuesday, April 16, in the Langone
Center Forum at 8:00 p.m., and will
be followed by a reception in Walls
Lounge.

Prof. charged
with harassment

Abraham Ordover, a professor
at Emory University Law School in
Aulanta, Georgia, after being cleared
of sexual harassment charges, re-
signed on April 1. This decision was
due to the protest of 300 students
who boycotted class and marched on
the school administration building
near March 19,

Ordover was acquitted of all
charges by a law school faculty
committee the day before the boy-
Cott; and two days after the protests
began, he took a temporary leave of
absence from his position, ultimately
resulting in his permanent resigna-
tion. Ordover was accused of kiss-
ing, touching, and making sexual
advances toward 13 female students
against their will.

At least one of the students did
not have the opportunity to speak
before the committee, according to
Scott Sanders, president of the Stu-
dent Bar Association. Sanders is a
third year law student who organized
a meeting with Dean Howard O.

Hunter and President James Laney
to protest the final decision, a charge
of inappropriate behavior and a for-
mal reprimand. Since the initial
complaints, several more students
and alumni have come forward with
similar charges of sexual harassment
against Ordover, bringing the total
number to approximately twenty.

Hazing plagues
campuses

As more fraternities and so-
rorities are punished for hazing,
Universities from over the United
States continue to wonder how to
stop such practices. Fraternities at
Alfred State, Baylor, Vanderbilt, and
Seton Hall have all been disciplined
for hazing. Among the hazing
crimes committed were possession
of stolen property and theft.

Many campuses are consider-
ing restrictions and fewer are abol-
ishing fraternities at their universi-
ties. Officials of Alfred State in New
York have decided to meet to estab-
lish the future existence of their fra-
ternities; it was on this same cam-
pus in 1978, that a fraternity pledge,
Chuck Stenzel, died during hazing
procedures. Stenzel’s mother, who
spoke to all fraternity and sorority
pledges at Bucknell University ear-
lier this semester, began an anti-haz-
ing program to stop such practices
from occurring.

Some fraternities have actu-
ally eliminated the pledge period to
totally eliminate hazing incidents.
Universities, as well as fraternity
chapters, remain unsure of how to
stop such events, but will do what-

By Timothy Amman
Staff Writer

Despite numerous rumors to
the contrary, it appears that the
landscape of the Bucknell campus
will remain quite similar to its
present condition for at least another
decade.

Although proposals to rede-
sign the entrance to campus and
change traffic flow on Seventh
Street do exist, there are no plans to
accomplish these objectives in the
near future.

The Helverson Group from
Boston worked with Bucknell offi-
cials for about a year on various
proposals for improved landscaping
and campus beautification. The re-
sults of their findings are contained
ina report which specifies suggested
improvements to be made over the
next ten to twenty years at Bucknell.

For instance, according to
Barry Maxwell, Vice President for
Administration, the creation of an
academic quad between Olin Sci-
ence Building and Dana Engineering
Building “is a component of a long
range plan for the University.” An-
other recommendation includes “re-

designing the intersection at Seventh
Street and Moore Avenue to align
pedestrian and vehicular flow,” in-
cluding the removal of Stuck House
and the Old Bison, and the reloca-
tion of Seventh Street House. As it is
now, the stop sign and pedestrian
crossing do not match and need to
be modified for safety reasons. A
third major recommended modifica-
tion involves redesigning the en-
trance to campus, putting a traffic
circle in front of Rooke Chapel and
eventual replacement of Faculty
Court. However, according to Max-
well, these proposals are “all very
expensive and require talks with
trustees as well as extensive campus
discussion” before any work is be-
gun.

Maxwell did indicate that
some recommendations such as bet-
ter lighting, placement of bicycle
racks, flower beds, etc. “can all be
accomplished within budgeted
funds.” Thus, these types of opera-
tions will be done on a continuing
basis. Furthermore, Maxwell indi-
cated that the cherry trees in the
academic quad are reaching the end
of their useful lives and thus will be
replaced early in 1994,

PELL grants

pledge covers a student throughout
the year.

In his original motion, Baker
recommended that the University
take one of two actions: either all
Bucknell students be forced to signa
similar pledge, or, if a Bucknell
student’s PELL grant were revoked
for an illegal drug use violation, then
Bucknell would be responsible for
replacing the lost grant money.

President Sojka expressed his
concern that the faculty had voted in
support of the Baker motion while
the BSG had voted almost unani-
mously against the motion.

Baker said that he didn’t feel

it was appropriate to punish a low
income student “for getting high
with their friend over the summer.”
He noted that this type of behavior
would not warrant kicking a student
off cumpus, but that a low-income
student who loses his PELL Grant
for some reason couldn’t afford to go
to Bucknell. This discrepancy is
discriminatory according to Baker.

Alex Sherer 93, president of
the BSG, said, “I don’t see it as be-
ing discriminatory in the same way
as the faculty. The main idea is that
drug usage is contrary to federal
law.”

Sherer suggested that it was
unfair for tuition paying Bucknell-
ians to subsidize those students

the waste get here, and how far does
it have to come?” Noting that there
are 1,500 transportation accidents
with chemicals cach year, Shinn
questioned the safety of transporting
hazardous waste by rail and highway
near the federal correctional facili-
ties in Lewisburg and Allenwood,
the Susquehanna River, and through
the Bucknell campus on Route 15.
Shinn felt the motion was an
approprate public statement of “a
faculty speaking on behalf of itself.”

Some of Shinn’s concerns
were echoed by President Gary
Sojka, who questioned the safety of
siting the facility near the

saying that “in principle, people
could move out of the area” if the in-
cinerator is built, but that inmates at
Allenwood, a mile and a half from
the proposed site and soon to be the
largest federal prison complex, do
not have that option.

The faculty motion, passed on
a voice vote, follows President
Sojka’s declaration last month that
the University as an institution
would not take a stand on the pro-
posed incinerator, but that campus
groups with the apparatus to debate
the matter, such as the faculty, were
encouraged to do so.

The local controversy began
last October when USPCI, Inc., a
unit of the Union Pacific Corpora-

eto remain sim

found in violation of federal law. He
also said that the motion could take
financial aid away from other
Bucknellians who are not violating
federal law.

“I have to assume that they
{the BSG] were somewhat misin-
formed about the motion,” said
Baker.

Sherer countered saying, “I do
not agree that congress was misin-
formed. We discussed the faculty’s
motion and their reasoning at length,
and Dean Baker’s proposal was is-
sued in verbatim.”

Longley, who supported this
motion, moved for the reconsidera-
tion because of difficulties that have
arisen as the administration attempts
to design implementation of the
policy. Baker then withdrew his
motion, substituting a motion which
scrapped the universal student
pledge.

Instead he suggested sending
a letter to PELL recipients explain-
ing that the drug pledge is a federal
policy, and that the University does
not condone the policy because it is
discriminatory.

Retaining the heart of his
measure, the compensation of lost
grant money with Bucknell funds,

Baker defined the issue as one of
making sure students “won’t lose
financial aid and be forced off cam-
pus for something other students
won’t be thrown off campus for.”

President Gary Sojka attacked
this position, addressing the concern
that “we will remove financial aid
from some other student if we must
make up for lost federal money with
institutional money.”

It was also noted that Ron
Laszewski, director of financial aid,
knew of no cases where a student has
lost PELL grants due to a drug con-
viction, and “it is unlikely it would
happen in the future.”

After wrangling over the lan-
guage of what Sojka described as “a
very carefully worded letter” to stu-
dents, the decision was made to table
the motion until the first meeting of
the fall semester, so that officials
could hammer out the language of a
perspective letter to students.

At the suggestion of Faculty
Chair David Ray that “dissatisfac-
tion with that [federal] policy should
be registered, a motion to that effect
was passed by voice vote, with ap-
proximately ten negative votes.”

Bio building

From page 1

Dana Engineering, the Bertrand li-
brary, and Cooley Hall.

Jim Hostetler, manager of
construction for the physical plant,
agreed that the project is proceeding
smoothly. He sees the biology pro-
gram and curriculum areas as the
largest and most important compo-
nent of the building, and is optimis-
tic that those areas will be completed
on time. Since the building is “much
like chemistry,” he says crews are
“moving along much faster than in
phase one.”

The center atrium, which con-
nects the biology building with the
chemistry building, is of lesser im-
portance, and need not be com-
pletely finished before the building
opens. Construction of the atrium,
however, “is progressing right on
schedule, but there are a lot of un-
knowns,” Hostetler warned.

Harclerode seemed excited
about the potential of the completed
building: “It’s a magnificent facility,
well-designed and well-planned.”
He noted that one out of every nine

Bucknell students is a biology ma-
jor, and another one out of nine takes
a biology course during his or her
four years here. “The new building
completely updates the department,”
Harclerode said.

He also observed that
Bucknell’s biology department is the

level as the large teaching laboratory
where his or her courses are taught.

Indeed, the building was de-
signed around the needs of the fac-
ulty. Harclerode said his favorite
Part of the building is the third floor,
where his office and lab are located.
“It fits together so well function-

ennai lied ese il
Bucknell’s biology department is the fifth

largest in the nation in terms of sending
students on to receive doctorate degrees.
“This building will allow us to do that better.”

fifth largest in the nation in terms of
sending students on to receive doc-
torate degrees. “This building will
allow us to do that better,” he said.
The new building features
laboratories for both non-major and
freshman and sophomore bio-major
core courses on the first floor, and
labs for upper-level biology courses
on the higher floors. Furthermore,
each professor’s office and personal
research lab are located on the same

wise; everything’s there I need to
do.” The design is far more than
simply functional, however. Its aes-
thetic details, especially the central
connecting section, will dominate
the campus when complete. The
atrium, with its huge, back-lit glass
dome, will be the focal point for
visitors approaching the University
along 7th Street.

Inside, the atrium will be
equally “stunning,” according to

Hostetler. He listed a few of the fea-
tures of the new section: granite
steps and bluestone flooring at the
outer entrance, a set of glass doors,
and then terrazzo flooring with brass
floor inserts depicting the four sym-
bols of alchemy: earth, fire, water
and air. There will also be an 85-foot
clear view up to the dome on the in-
side.

Hostetler also commented that
the third floor will feature “two ex-
tremely well-appointed lounges.”
Each will have very high ceilings
with multiple skylights and floor-to-
ceiling windows looking outside.
The lounge on the west side of the
building will be for faculty and staff,
while the students’ lounge will face
Dana Engineering and the
Susquehanna river.

After the biology building is
complete and the department has
moved out of its offices in Taylor
and Botany, renovation will begin of
the Botany building. Following that
renovation, “the Botany building
will be re-assigned to the Career
Development Center [CDC] and the
personnel office,” Maxwell said. The
space the CDC vacates in Carnegie
will then be used by the geology
department. No decision has yet
been made concerning which cam-
Pus group will occupy Taylor Hall.

Phase three of the science cen-
ter complex, which has yet to be
scheduled, will involve the con-
struction of a psychology building
and the complete renovation of the
Carnegie building for geology.
When built, the new 50,000 square
foot psychology building will be
situated across from the computer
center in the open space next to Olin
and behind the biology building. It
will connect to the biology building
through the use of knock-out panels
already installed in that building’s
foundation.

TIP

From page 1

according to Weddle, is to serve “as.
a clearing house for the ideas of the
individual committees.”

Of major concern for Presi-
dent Sojka, Weddle, and Skena
from the outset was student in-
volvement in the changes being
brought about by TIP. The com-
mittees are “mainly comprised of
students,” Weddle said, with some
involvement and guidance from the
administration, particularly from
student life, and several faculty.

But student involvement has
met with varying degrees of suc-
cess. Some of the student chairs
have been very pleased with the
administration’s ability to relinquish
control. “We've been very inde-
pendent,” said Bob Ritter 92, co-
chair of the committee on residential
changes. “Charlotte would offer
ideas here and there, but we were
free to formulate our own recom-
mendations.”

Alex Bergmann ’92, chair of
the committee on the freshman year
experience, was also pleased with
the way the administration handled
TIP, but said that they might have
“saved a lot of time and effort” with
an administrator in charge of the
committee because “students just
don’t have the time to deal with it.”

Others were not as pleased
with the way the administration
acted. Steve Hoerter ’91, co-chair
of the committee on the four-year
residency requirement, feels that
“the whole process has been admin-
istration-led,” and has been “too
closely tied to Residential Life.”
“Whether that's the fault of the ad-
ministration or the student body, I'm
not sure,” Hoerter said.

Some of the faculty seemed a
bit confused by TIP’s method of op-
eration. Dick Henry, professor of
physics and a member of the com-
mittee on Greek life, said, “It was
really very mysterious to me. It was
all thrown to the students.” He said
“weird” was the only word to de-
scribe it.

His committee never had a set
meeting time and strange items
sometimes appeared on the agenda.
However, he did think that “it was a

good idea to have students running
the committees.” “In terms of how
the changes were done, it was stu-
dents who had the most influence,”
and this, he thought, was what TIP
needed to give it validity with the
students in general.

Skena and Weddle both stress
the importance of student input. “We
are going to suffer if students don’t
stay abreast of what’s going on,” says
Weddle. Although students have
been the main contributors to the
committees, it has only been a small
percentage of the student body which
has been involved at all. Hoerter said
that “people haven’t taken the initia-
tive to become involved,” and, as a
result, the students will end up being
“reactive instead of proactive.”
Ritter feels that “if the administration
gives them the chance, then the
burden’s on the students” to get in-
volved.

The process that the commit-
tees have followed was roughly bro-
ken down into three stages. Stage
one was to write preliminary reports.
These were all finished by February.
The reports then led directly to stage
two of the process.

Stage two involved getting in-
put on the preliminary reports from
as many sources as possible. For that
purpose, open forums, which Skena
says were “widely advertised,” were
held and all of the preliminary reports
were put on reserve at Bertrand Li-
brary. The hope was that the forums
would “allow all members of the
University community to comment
on the proposals,” said Weddle.

The third and present stage of
the process involves writing the final
report to be submitted to Sojka. This
report will encompass the initial rec-
ommendations of the preliminary re-
port, adjusted for any questions, con-
cerns or recommendations offered at
the open forum.

Members of the Bucknell
community are also being encour-
aged to review the TIP reports and
the initial TIP guidelines, all of
which are on reserve in the Bertrand
Library, to give input and sugges-
tions on the recommendations. At
this point, Weddle recommends that
any “input should be addressed to the
president.”

jazz to the Bison

By Carl Walker

Jazz has returned to the Bi-
son with the Jazz and Blues Ex-
Press music series sponsored by
Bison Programming and AACF.
The series began Sunday with the
New York-based fusion group
Mike Freeman and Spellbound.

In a polished and profes-
sional show, the band promoted
their new CD with original com-
positions written by vibraphonist
and band leader Mike Freeman.
They opened up with “Serendip-
ity,” a mixture of intricate chords
and textures supplied by Freeman
and guitarist Paul Myers layered
over the steady groove of bassist
Norbert Marias and drummer Tom
Cohen. They continued with more
material from the CD, showing
their heavy Latin and funk influ-

ences. Of particular note was
“Channels” in which Norbert broke
away from the foundation and
played a technical and melodic
solo. Freeman’s song-writing es-
pecially shone through on “Eastern
Lights,” a slower song with an ex-
tended vibraphone intro. The band
came together on the pedal-to-the-
metal song “Mint Tea” in which
the fast unison line seemed effort-
less and natural.

Spellbound was more than
four great musicians; it was a co-
hesive unit. Founded by Freeman
in 1985, the band currently plays in
clubs and colleges around the
Northeast.

Bison Jazz and Blues Express fea-
turing Zydeco, a combination of
cajun, blues and reggae, with Ma-
jor Handy, this Sunday at 7 p.m.

Dance Co. holds
informal showing

By Karen Ebersold
Staff Writer

The Bucknell Dance Com-
pany held a showing of current
pieces and works-in-progress by
faculty and students April 4 in Tustin
Theatre. Guest performers included
two dance classes and visiting artists
from New York University.

A highlight of the concert was
the performance of the Jazz I and
Flamenco dance classes. “Touch
Faith,” the jazz piece choreographed
by Shellie Cash-Muller, assistant
professor of dance, was filled with
energy and spirit. Professor Cash-
Muller’s Flamenco class performed
a unique rhythmic dance of Spanish
influence, “‘Sevillanas (First Copla)
and Bulerias.”

“Women’s Songs,” an expres-
sive and humorous piece by Assis-
tant Professor of Dance Danna
Frangione, featured vocalist
Catherine Roth, an English professor
at Dickinson College. Rather than

using music for “Oh, Mother,” di-
rector of movement Janelle Oltorik
*93 set her dancers against an ex-
cerpt from Kahil Gabran’s poem
“The Prophet.” Other pieces in-
cluded “Far From Over,” a moving
solo performed by Amy Kantor '94;
“Harry,” a jazz trio choreographed
by Oltorik; and “Challenge of the
Warriors,” a piece charged with a
native beat choreographed by Erin
Hunter 92.

The last three works of the
show were choreographed and per-
formed by visiting artists form the
NYU/Tisch School for the Arts.
“Untitled” and “Haiku” displayed
expressive motion and thought, and
“First Kiss” rounded out the show
with a charming combination of act-
ing and dancing.

Each piece was unique and re-
freshing, leaving the audience to
look forward to the Dance
Company’s annual spring concert
May 10 and 11 at the Weis Center.

Come see some of Bucknell’s
most talented musicians perform in
the Wind Ensemble and Symphonic
Band concert this Thursday. Both
groups will play an array of works
under the direction of William
Kenny, assistant professor of music.

The performance will open
with the Wind Ensemble’s brass
quintet consisting of Todd Vogel
91, John Milius 94, Julie Shurilla
91, Sarah Danser ’93, and Greg
Amarante ’94. The group will play a
spirited Baroque piece entitled
“Canzona Bergamasca.”

The Wind Ensemble will also
perform “Variations on America,”
composed by Charles Ives at the age
of 17. This work is full of musical
jokes in addition to patriotism. Ac-
cording to Kenny, “it is kind of
laughable.”

The Symphonic Band’s pro-
gram will include “The Cowboys”
from a film score by John Williams,
the conductor of the Boston Pops.
The group will then conclude the
concert with a fiery Armenian piece,
the conclusion to “Armenian
Dances” by Alfred Reed.

The free concert will be April

18 at 8 p.m. in the Weis Center.

Bison Tales

By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

They appear after Spring
Break. Consistently clad in white
cotton shirts and shorts, oblivious
to the wind-chill-factor. Their
boisterous smiles sparkle with ex-
tra shine against their sun-
muddened complexions...

The irony is, we actually
give them compliments. We say
things like, “Hey! Great tan! Nice
going! I just can’t believe how tan
you are!” As if shelling out money
for air-fare and baking on a blan-
ket for an entire week is some great
accomplishment. And it seems like
these mesquite-menaces can’t
even accept our praise graciously.
They reply, “You think I’m tan?!?
God, are you kidding! I’m practi-
cally pale now! You should have
seen me a week ago when they had
to pry me off my beech towel with
a spatula, I was REALLY dark
then.”

“Yeah, whatever you say,” I
mumbled as I ran for my bathing
suit this past weekend, hoping that
five hours under the Lewisburg
sun minus any type of protective
covering would be all I needed to
“catch up” to the sooty show-offs.
That evening, my skin glowed
brightly beneath three coats of
Noxema applied in a futile effort
to relieve the pain. After writhing
under electric sheets in basted
agony, I awoke the next day to
discover that my pigment had al-
ready returned to its normal death-
white tint.

I think the generic appeal of
“the sun-tan” is that it makes a per-
son look “healthy” with almost no
hassle. You don’t even have to ex-
ercise! Never mind all that blab-
bering about UV light, wrinkles,
and noses falling off; looking

healthy without the pains of diets
or jumping jacks is IN.

Even fast-food chains have
realized this fact. McDonalds, for
example, has expanded their se-
lection of flavorful low-calorie
items beyond the realm of Diet
Coke and Mclce-Water. They are
now featuring a special low-cal,
low-fat burger which is reportedly
almost as good as their regular
stuff. They have named the
creation...(you guessed it)
“McLEAN.” The secret of the
sandwich’s enhanced taste lies in
the fact that the company has spe-
cially flavored the meat with Sea-
weed Extract. Yummy. The Sea-
weed will supposedly provide
moisture to the beef which was lost
when all those tangy fatty juices
were lipposucked out. McDonalds
is even developing a new ad-cam-
paign centered around the deli-
cious new product. “McDonalds:
FOOD, FOLKS, and FUNGUS.”

If you try this novel creation
and feel a little fishy, or get a little
green around the gills, you might
be interested to know that, in addi-
tion to the seaweed, the pattie is
also peppered with chemical-based
“flavor-enhancers” like Monoso-
dium Glutamate (MSG). The job
of MSG is to artificially stimulate
your tastebuds causing you to
think that your sodium saturated
algae-burger tastes like Filet Mi-
gnon. Now, even though this
chemical is known to cause a va-
riety of reactions which include
vomiting, migraines, and fever, the
fact does remain that it is ex-
tremely low in calories.

So if you want to look
healthy this summer without ex-
erting too much energy or stifling
your tastebuds, remember: Easy

Bucknell twins!

By Claire Davidson
Staff Writer

At some point in our lives we
have all wished that we could have
someone else take an exam for us;
someone who could get us an A. In
high school, twins Erin and Faith
Hunter ‘92 used their similar ap-
pearance to do just this. After Faith
had successfully completed her own
math exam, she deviously switched
clothes with her twin sister, and took
the same exam an hour later. Not
only does being twins allow these
two sisters to engineer this type of
trick, but it also gives each a unique
relationship with someone on whom
they can always depend.

Another set of twins, seniors
Cathleen and Caroline Shantz not
only both go to Bucknell but live in
the same mod together. “We have
always been best friends,” com-
mented Cathleen. She and Erin agree
that the greatest advanatage of hav-
ing a twin is that there is always
someone that they can count on to
listen and genuinely care about
them. “It is like having a best friend
with you all the time,” Erin added.

Freshman twins Sue and Ed
Gegnas chose to come to Bucknell
together because from the list of
colleges they both were accepted to,
Bucknell was their first choice. For
Sue, as well as for Cathleen and Erin,
growing up with a twin was a posi-
tive experience and they agree that
the advanatages of having a twin
outweigh any disadvantages.

“In high school we really
didn’t have that much competition

between us,” explained Cathleen.
She and her sister played on the bas-
ketball team together, were in simi-
lar classes and had the same group
of friends. “We both were glad we
were going to the same school. I
don’t think we were ready to split
up,” she continued. Erin and her twin
Faith also knew that they wanted to
Stay together. She explained that
there was some competition between
them but not in a negative way. Sue,
who was in many of the same
courses as her brother, added that
although there was a lot of competi-
on it wasn’t ever verbalized.
However, despite the similari-
ties between the twins, there are
some differences that often are over-

looked. Cathleen explained that al-
though they might look alike and
dress in the same style of clothing,
their personalities differ. “People
who don’t know us would have
trouble seeing the differences but I
think I am a little more outgoing than
Caroline.” Erin agreed that there are
definitely differences between her
and Faith, but their friends all have a
different opinion about what they
are.

For Sue and Ed, living at
Bucknell with a twin is also very
different than being in high school.
“At Bucknell, I can go a week with-
Out seeing my brother. I have to ac-
tually go and see him,” commented
Sue. At Bucknell, people are not as

aware of twins since it is a much
larger environment and greater vari-
ety of classes and activities are of-
fered. “We live more separate lives
here at Bucknell. It is not much dif-
ferent. It’s just not as noticeable,”
added Cathleen.

In addition to the differences
there are also some disadvantages,
“People see us as so similar that it is
really hard to be an individual,” said
Cathleen. Erin agreed that some-
times being a twin is hard especially
when they are both trying for some-
thing, like a role in a play or a posi-
tion on a sports team. “Sometimes
they might not want to hurt the
other’s feelings so they don’t take
either of us, “ explained Erin.

“It is also difficult for our
parents around finals when we are
both leaving at different times,”
added Sue.

Aside from these few disad-
vantages, they all feel that they have
a relationship with their twins that
doesn’t compare to any other kind of
friendship. Cathleen commented, “I
know her so well that I know how
she feels and how she thinks.”

“Sometimes we look at each
other and know that we’re thinking
the same thing,” added Erin. She
also said that sometimes strange
things happen to them, For example,
during high school, the day before
Erin fractured her arm during gym-
nastics, Faith’s arm hurt in the same
place.

“Even now that Faith is abroad
for a semester, I still know what she
is thinking and feeling,” explained

Professors keep a leash —

on their popular

By David Soll
Staff Writer

Although the Bucknell Stu-
dent Government has passed a reso-
lution requiring all dogs to be on
leashes while on campus, Bucknell
professors still bring their dogs to
school with them. They see the dogs
as a way to relieve the stress of a
hard day, both for themselves and
for their students.

Perhaps the best-known pro-
fessor-pet pairing is Chair and Asso-
ciate Professor of Economics
Michael Moohr and his Cavalier
King Charles Spaniel, Christopher,
Described as a “very visual dog” be-
cause of his hunting ancestry, Chris-
topher has been known to “attack a
rabbit on a greeting card.” Moohr’s
wife, president of Vassar College,
gave him the dog so he “would have
someone to sleep with,” since theirs
is a commuter marriage. She “‘ada-
mantly opposes” allowing Christo-
pher to have a female doggie com-
panion, although Professor Moohr
believes that his puppy should needs
one. Moohr asked that concerned
students “petition his wife to let
Christopher have a ladyfriend.”

Another prominent dog on
campus is Cooky, who belongs to
the married couple of Owen Floody,
professor and chair of psychology
and Andrea Halpern, associate pro-
fessor of psychology. The pair keeps
the dog in one of their offices during
the day, taking Cooky for walks be-
tween classes. A few years ago,
Cooky was nearly killed by a swarm
of yellowjackets while tied up out-
side the Langone Center. Professor
of English John Murphy bravely cut
Cooky’s leash and Professor of Po-
litical Science Harry Blair rushed

Cooky to the veterinarian. The
couple received many calls from
concerned witnesses.

Katherine Faull, assistant pro-
fessor of Modern Languages, also
appreciates her colleagues’ love for
her new dog, Brit. Other members of
the department enjoy playing with
Brit and, as Faull notes, “She is a
useful tool for teaching the impera-
tive.” Brit also caused a change in
her wardrobe. She now occasionally
dresses in black and white in an ef-
fort to color coordinate with her dal-
matian.

One of the most talented dogs
on campus is Petra, the yodeling dog,
who belongs to Assistant Professor
of Psychology Chris O’Sullivan.
Anyone who sees O’ Sullivan driving
will be able to hear Petra yodeling
beside her. O’ Sullivan is unsure why
Petra howls, but thinks it might be

her Oklahoma prairie heritage.
Whatever the cause, Petra has come
a long way since O’Sullivan found
her severely malnourished and
barely able to walk. Now, however,
Petra is one of the sprightliest dogs
on campus and vacations at Martha’s
Vineyard during the summer.

Since most students cannot
have an animal at college, they can
rest assured that, with spring here,
their professor’s dogs will be out in
full bloom.

Right: Professor Moohr and his
loverlorn cocker spaniel Christo-
pher are a familiar sight on the
academic quad. Maybe Christo-
pher should meet Brit, Professor
Faull’s dalmatian? [below] Brit
helps Faull teach the imperative

Cri
rime Pays

The Baker proposal is preposterous! The fact that the faculty initially endorsed it is even more so.

If the University decided to reimburse criminals for their lost PELL grants, then financial aid would be di-
verted from other students who receive aid from the University. Under the same line of reasoning employed by the
faculty, this would clearly discriminate against law-abiding Bucknellians. Do we fight discrimination with discrimi-
nation? Would doing so alleviate the problem or exacerbate it?

The other option in the proposal would require that all students sign the same disclaimer concerning drug use.
While this option seems more appealing on the surface, it could possibly reduce Bucknell’s applicant pool because
students would be uneasy about a disclaimer that other schools do not employ. Furthermore, what action would the
University take against those students who refuse to sign?

At the very heart of the debate is not only the impracticality of the motion, but also its spirit. Is it appropriate
for a democratic society to decide that it will not subsidize higher education for individuals found in violation of the
law? Should crime pay?

The war on drugs costs this nation dearly, both in dollars and in human lives, and it is quite appropriate for
those who perpetuate the demand for illegal contraband to be punished. Receiving a PELL grant is not a right of
students but rather a privilege. Grant recipients are in effect asking their government to pay for part of their educa-
tion, and in return, they have a responsibility to abide by the laws of their government.

Clearly, Sojka was in a quandary when the BSG voted nearly unanimously against a motion that the faculty
had previously passed. When the two deliberative bodies are at odds, whose decision should be given preference?
The answer: the group more affected by the decision. How would the faculty react if the BSG began making deci-

sions on tenure and raises for the faculty?

Dress Denim with Tie

Don’t forget to vote this Wednesday, April 17!

When you go to the wardrobe to select your clothes for the day, you will, in essence, be voting. If you select
jeans, you are voting for equal rights for all human beings, including homosexuals and bisexuals. If you make a
conscious decision not to wear jeans, you are, in effect, condoning discrimination.

Wearing jeans does not mean that you support or condone homosexual behavior; it merely signifies a belief
that all human beings are endowed with the same inalienable rights regardless of their sexual orientation.

The rift between the Ad Hoc Committee for Heterosexual Awareness (AHCHA) and Friends of Lesbians And
Gays (FLAG) illustrates the misunderstanding over jeans day.

AHCHA has an undeniable right to free speech, and the defacement of their chalkings by POWER is detest-
able and may have irreparably damaged the message which FLAG is trying to communicate to the campus.

It is clear that two camps have formed, both of which feel threatened by each other. If progressive change is
tly to be achieved, the two groups must work together, educate cach other, and overcome their prejudices. The two
positions are not irreconcilable.

So, how should Bucknellians vote on Wednesday? We “endorse” wearing jeans with a jacket and tie or other
formal attire, a clear statement that supports the equal rights of all people—heterosexuals, homosexuals, and bi-

sexuals

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Heterosexual pride
day disturbs students

To the Editor: publicize their heterosexual pride
since it is already accepted and
celebrated by society? We want
the group to realize that by sup-
porting homosexual/human
rights, no one is trying to oppose
heterosexuality. The purpose is
to see others as people with dif-
ferences, but also with rights.
We would ask the group and
individuals to continue to cel-
ebrate sexuality and diversity but
to do soina
positive
way, without
needing to
reduce oth-
ers and at-
tack their
differences.
We chal-
lenge the
group to
honestly ask
themselves
why they
need to see and feel more hetero-
sexual affirmation.

Doubts about one’s sexual-
ity cause too many problems in
relationships (heterosexual and
homosexual) and in personal
self-esteem. We hope the doubts
that are driving this group to
vehemently advocate and publi-
cize heterosexual pride day can
be overcome before they become
dangerous. We also hope the
group will stop putting up the
signs because they are offensive,
abusive and demonstrate a poten-
tially harmful view of sexuality
and individual differences.

We would like to respond
to the members of the newly
visible group F.A.G, (friends of
anti-gays) who have recently
publicized April 17 (Bucknell’s
designated Jeans Day) as Het-
erosexual Pride Day. We want
to ask: isn’t every day hetero-
sexual pride day?

One only has to watch five
minutes of
television or
browse a
popular
magazine to
see that
heterosexu-
ality is the
recognized
“norm” in
this country.
There is
nothing
wrong with
feeling pride in oneself and
one’s sexuality— maybe we
need more of that. But pride
should not have to come only
with the degradation of another
person or group of people.

Jeans Day is a day of
recognition of rights for all
people, focusing especially on
those who are gay, lesbian, or
bisexual. It is a celebration of
diversity, not an attack on het-
erosexuality or any other differ-
ences. This new group and its
offensive name and acronym
have misinterpreted and twisted
the meaning of Jeans Day, but to
what end? Do they feel more
heterosexual when they label
themselves “anti-gay”? And
why do these individuals need to

Group’s actions undermine civil
rights of campus community

By Zoe Ingram

Lately, I have seen many post-
ers around campus advocating that
one wear either a coat and tie or a
skirt or dress (i.e. no jeans) on April
17. This is supposedly to show one’s
support for heterosexuality. I find
this rather distressing.

Each day for the week leading
up to Bucknell’s Earth Day 1991 has
been designated as an awareness day
for a disenfranchised group of
people. Every day during this week,
programs will be held for everyone
to learn about social, economic, and
political inequalities. Our supposed
equal opportunity “land of the free”
not only condones, but actively
supports inequality and selective
discrimination. That this country
actually does support the disenfran-
chisement of select groups of people
flies in the face of our own ideals.

The lessons that I have learned
about what our country actually
stands for have been difficult ones to
learn and even harder to accept.
However, the truth asserted itself
and I was made to listen, however
unwillingly at first.

The fact of the matter is that
every day of every year is hetero-
sexual rights day. Our entire cul-
tures revolves around heterosexual

“norms.” How many movies, tele-
vision shows, or commercials has
the average person seen during the
past year that has had positive im-
ages of gay, lesbian, or bisexual
people in them? How many love
songs are there about same-sex rela-
tionships? Do people awkwardly
Stare at an obviously heterosexual

Why does Bucknell deem it permis-
sible to violate its own anti-dis-
crimination policy regarding sexual
orientation even when that leaves the
University liable?

We live in a heterosexist,
homophobic society. April 17 was
designated by the Earth Day Plan-
ning Committee to be Gay/Lesbian/
Bisexual rights day. Accordingly, it
is Jeans Day. Jeans Days date back
to the time I was in elementary

Lack of activities results from
lack of campus support

By Dennis Barnes

Last Sunday one of the best
fusion jazz groups I have ever had
the opportunity to hear played live
in the Bison. Unfortunately, I was
one of about thirty people who at-
tended the production. “Cel-
ebrating Diversity” was one of the
recent slogans
of our univer-
sity. I, for
one, do not
see that phi-
losophy
shared by
very many
people here.
Itseems to me that Bucknell tends
to attract many people who are not
willing to break out of their com-
fortable realms to experience
something different. I know how
tough it is to consider alternative
modes of thought and culture, but
what better time or place to do so
than right here and now. This
piece was supposed to be an opin-
ion on Mike Freeman and Spell-

bound, the group that played here
last Sunday (who, by the way, was
fantastic), but I feel compelled to say
something more than that.

I have been here for four years
and I have heard, on many occa-
sions, people say things like “...it’s
so boring here,” “...1 have nothing
to do,” and “...there’s a lack of cul-

ments are quite true; but less true
than was the case several years ago.
Today, some of us are really trying
to provide alternative activities that
are culturally different and enlight-
ening. However, there is very little
support for the events we brought to
campus. I know and understand that
not everyone cares to experience
anything past the monotonously

good number of people who would
like to check out something new

My point
is this: if more

could very possibly lose an educa-
tion at Bucknell. There are so many
weapons that can, and have been
used against gay, lesbian, and bi-
sexual people right here at this cam-
pus. If none of your friends openly
claim a gay, lesbian, or bisexual
identity, its probably because they
are afraid of you, the society we live
in, or both.

When I first came out as a bi-
sexual man at Bucknell, I lost a few
friends, received a few death threats,
and had to come to terms with a
beautiful campus tumed ugly by ha-
tred. The climate has improved
since I have come here, but there is
still a long way to go. The signs
plastered around campus are one ex-
ample of just how far we have to go.
What is most offensive about the
sign is that they are sponsored by a
group known a F.A.G. (Friends of
Anti-Gays) There is a big difference
between support of a positive iden-
tity of any group and disenfranchis-
ing another. Although I am bisexual,
I support heterosexuality. I support
it by helping heterosexual friends
through problems, watching hetero-
sexual movies and television shows,
by living in a heterosexual culture.

The fact that F.A.G. is a bla-
tantly bigoted organization attempt-
ing to undermine a day for civil
rights makes my stomach turn. The
fact that I have heard people saying
that they will wear suits to support
an anti-gay group makes me scared.
Because of my past experience, I
know what women feel when they
walk alone at night. I know the
anxiety of passing a large group of
men. I know to keep glancing at my
feet at night so I can see if there are
any shadows approaching from be-
hind. How much longer will we al-
low this to happen on our campus?
For these reasons, and many, many
more I will walk in the Take Back
the Night march, wear jeans—no tie
and jacket—on Jeans Day, and par-
ticipate in the multi-cultural and
other awareness day programs.
Please, help stop the terror, if only
by keeping an open mind and will-
ingness to learn about others differ-
ent from you.

THE FUTURE OF

Skena’s
Prescription

By David Skena

This weekend is appropria-
tions weekend. If you belong to any
student clubs your group may be
applying for BSG funds right now.
Over the past few weeks many
people have expressed concerns
about the appropriations process.
Regardless of the cause, almost ev-
eryone feels that they have been
treated badly by the Appropriations
Committee. Complaints of “we al-
ways used to get money for this...”
or “why did group bla bla bla receive
100% when we only got 28% of our
request?” are very common. These
concerns are legitimate and they
force one to look at the root of the
problem. The source of all the
trouble is the fact that more and more
groups are trying to grab bigger
pieces of the Student Activities fee
pie. The pie, however, isn’t getting
any bigger.

The problem can be resolved
by raising the Student Activities fee

of every student or by clubs scaling
back their activities. The Appro-
priations Committee must ask the
BSG to “raise taxes” or cut back
programs, the same dilemma faced
by the Federal Government. Unlike
the U.S. Government, the BSG can-
Not go into debt.

If the student groups on this
campus want enough funding avail-
able for every request, they should
speak to the BSG congress and lobby
that the Student Activities fee be
significantly raised. If the student
body feels $100 a head is enough,
then they should make the BSG
aware of that. This might be a good
time for a referendum on the issue.
In any event, the appropriations is-
sue will continue to be debated. If
you have a complaint, voice it, but
remember that the Appropriations
Committee does its very best to be
as fair and equitable as it can. The
committee of 15 is comprised en-
tirely of students who receive no pay
for their efforts.

As you enjoy your weekend,
remember that each of these students
is devoting 12 hours of his or her
time to ensure every student group
will have enough funding to con-
tinue its existence at Bucknell. Feel
free to complain if you want change,
then offer assistance if you can.

A Bison has his spike blocked by a Messiah middleblocker during last
weekend’s five game loss in Davis Gym.

By Mike Lutz

The Bucknell men’s volley-
ball team was defeated this weekend
in a close match against Messiah
College. The match, which lasted
for almost two and a half hours, went
five games and the Bison lost 15-6,
12-15, 6-15, 15-8, 17-15.

The Bison started the first
game very slowly and fell behind by
a seven point deficit they could not
overcome in a 15-6 loss.

Bucknell did battle back
though. Messiah overpassed
Bucknell’s serves on numerous
occassions allowing Glenn Gesek
*94 to increase his kill total to ten by
the end of the second game.

The Bison’s dominance in the
second game carried over to the third
game. Setter Mike Lutz ’94 jump-
served five service aces to begin the
third game giving the Bison a 5-0
advantage they would not relinquish.

The Bison had the lead going
into the fourth match and therefore
felt very relaxed. This proved to be
their downfall as they could not fin-
ish off Messiah. Messiah showed
their experience creeping back into
the match from behind winning
eventually in a tie-breaker in the fifth
game.

Ben Jarosz ’94 and Brian Sell
"94 led the Bison with 21 and 17
kills, respectively. Gessek also

rth in a grueling five game match

contributed substantially with 14
kills, but only four of those came
after the second game.

The Bison ended the season on
a sad note with this defeat, but
overall the team played very well.
The Bison were hurt by their lack of
experience in the deciding game as
they could not maintain a 12-8 ad-
vantage.

The Bison was also hampered
during the match by the absense of
staring middle hitter Chris Dycka
"93 who could not play because of a
necker injury he sustained while
training over spring break.

When asked about the team’s
loss, Dycka stated, “I was really
sorry I did not get to play, but the
guys played their hearts out and we
are all looking foward to next year.”

With the season brought to an
end Jarosz reflected on the season.
“We really did not know what to
expect going into the season. With
four freshman starting we definitely
lacked experience. And as any ath-
lete knows experience goes a long
way.

We are all looking forward to
the next few years to see if we can
make men’s Bucknell volleyball a
strong force in Pennsylvania. The
sport is growing very rapidly at the
collegiate level and we want to be a
part of that growth,” he said.

Bucknell crew stays afloat in Georgia

Last fall’s watershed season
ended triumphantly with both men’s
and women’s Varsity Eight gold
medals at the Frostbite regatta. As the
Bison enjoy their second semester of
varsity status, they have appropri-
ately chosen the hardest training and
racing schedule yet.

During spring break, the Bison
travelled to Georgia for the 1991
Augusta Invitational Regatta. Forty
teams, including the Canadian Na-
tional team and a Soviet squad,
competed on March 30 at the
Riverfront Marina beside the scenic
Savannah River.

Several Bison teams were able
to place, led by the Men’s Varsity
Four who, won their heat and took
silver in the finals with a time of
8:01.39. The Varsity Women’s Eight

tional champion Wisconsin crew,

time of 7:32.33. The Men’s Novice
Lightweight Eight took second with
a time of 8:06.53, while the Men’s
Novice Heavyweight Eight took
third despite equipment trouble
during the race. The Women’s
Novice Eight came in third in the
first round losing to tough Wiscon-
sin and UCF crews.

The women’s softball team
successfully stretched their winning
streak to six yesterday with a sweep
of a doubleheader against Penn
State, 1-0 and 3-2. The wins push
Bucknell to 15-4-1 on the year with
a perfect 2-0 record in Icague play.
Although Bucknell ranks fifth in
Division I for team scoring at 7.38
runs per game and seventh in the
nation in batting average with .327,
defense and good pitching proved to
be the key factors in yesterday’s
games,

In the first game Lisa Fink ’93
beat out a throw to the plate to give
Sharon Nichols ’91 her sixth victory
of the year as the Lady Bison won 1-
0. Fink led off the seventh inning

with a walk and advanced to second
on Karen Smolskis’s '91 bunt single,
the only base hit for the Bison for the
game. Carol Gessler ’93 then hit a
deep fly ball to center to move Fink
over to third, setting up the table for
Jill Szafranski 93. Szafranski
fought off a couple of tough pitches
then hit a hard grounder to third that
was bobbled by the third baseman.
Fink, who was running on contact,
beat out the throw at home to give
Bucknell the win.

“Tt was important for us to win
these games today,” said Szafranski.
“Tt will really give us some momen-
tum going into Patriot League play.”

In the second game, Bucknell
only needed three runs to beat State,
and freshman Heather Hoehn ’94
proved to be the catalyst. Early in
the game she drove in Gessler, who

had just tripled, with a hit up the
middle. In the sixth Hoehn scored
the winning run on a single by an-
other freshman, Mollie Laubauch off
the third baseman’s glove. For the
game, Laubauch had the only mul-
tiple hit performance, going 2-for-3.
Hoehn had reached base on a walk
and moved into scoring position af-
ter advancing to second base on a
wild pitch. Fink went the distance
for Bucknell on the mound holding
Penn State to just two runs on two
hits in seven innings, earing her
fourth win of the season.

“This is just a total team ef-
fort,” said co-captain Jen Kalochie
*91, who made an incredible diving
catch in the first game. “We’re hit-
ting the ball well, playing solid de-
fense, and just have strong team
unity out on the field. If we keep this

up I'd like to think we could win it
all.”

Kalochie, whe is currently tied
for tenth in the nation averaging one
RBI per contest, and the rest of
Coach Dale Franquet’s team will
have a chance to prove themselves
this weekend when they travel to
Army and Fordham in two key
doubleheaders in for the Patriot
League standings.

Army returns a strong nucleus
from a very solid 29-10 team last
year, including their top four hitters.
Jackie Patten topped the Cadets in
1990 with 43 hits, while Julie Robert
batted .353. Charlotte Tobin will
also be returning, bringing her team
leading 30 RBI from last year.
Fordham, on the other hand should
not be as competitive, as they fin-
ished last season with an 8-31

Tennis tops Lehigh, falls to Hens

Bison to continue Patriot League play Monday against Lafayette

By Scott Brown
Staff Writer

Entering perhaps the toughest
week of the season to date, the men’s
tennis team needs to rebound after
losing to Delaware while almost
blowing a lead to Lehigh.

The Bison played their last
match Wednesday, in Delaware, and
got off to a strong start in singles
winning four of their six matches.
Leading the way was number one
singles, player Jerome Charlier ‘92,
who won easily, 6-4, 6-1. Andrew
Cantor ‘92 won 6-3, 6-3, in an unac-
customed spot for him, the three
spot. He moved up after winning all
five of his matches of the season at
the fourth spot.

Scott Bank ‘91 won his sixth
singles match of the season, 6-3, 6-2
at number five while Chris Rimpel
‘93 came from behind, taking his
opponent to the third set before
winning, 6-7, 6-1, 6-4.

Bruno Barbera ‘94 was de-
feated after being promoted to the
second singles position, 6-3, 6-3.
Cris Stenstrom ‘94 went down, 6-3,
6-2.

From here things only got
worse for Bucknell. All they needed
to do was win one doubles match to
ensure a victory for the team but they
were swept. Charlier and Stenstrom
lost a gruelling match 7-6, 7-6 as
Barbera and Cantor were falling at
number-two doubles 6-3, 6-1. Only
Bank and Greg Downing ‘94 were
able to even battle into the third set,
but they fell 6-4, 6-7, 6-2. The 5-4
loss moved the Bison’s overall sea-
son record to 4-5.

The men began the week at
home in their first conference
matchup of the season against
Lehigh. Again they struck early,
coming up strong in four of the six
singles matches to take the early
lead.

Charlier had to battle a power-
ful serve by Ryan Gelrod, who was
last year’s ECC number one singles

runner-up. After losing an carly lead
in the first set, it took him three sets
before he was able to claim victory,
5-7, 6-4, 6-0.

Barbera and Cantor also
needed three sets for their wins at the

number two and four singles, re-
spectively. Barbera won 6-1, 5-7,
6-4 while Cantor outlasted his op-
ponent, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1. Bank was also
successful at the fifth spot with a
Straight set victory, 6-4, 6-2.

Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian

Jerome Charlier ’92, seen here in last Saturday’s number-one singles
match against Lehigh’s Ryan Gelrod, won in three sets, 5-7, 6-4, 6-0.
Gelrod was the runner-up at last spring’s ECC Championships.

Stenstrom fell in two sets, 6-3,
6-2, while Rimpel, at number six,
eventually lost in the third set, 4-6,
6-4, 6-3.

Again all Bucknell had to do
was win one doubles match to ensure
team victory and that is all they did.
The number two duo of Cantor and
Barbera was able to oulast Lehigh,
6-7 (8-6), 6-2, 6-4. Stenstrom and
Charlier was defeated 6-4, 2-6, 6-4,
while the third pair, Bank and
Rimpel, fell 6-2, 6-3, leaving the
score for the match 5-4 in favor of
Bucknell.

Bank commented on the char-
acter of the team’s play this past
week, “The team is young and the
Lehigh win proves that we are ma-
turing. However, the Delaware loss
proves that we need work in being
match tough and competing over the
course of an entire season. We’re
basically encouraged by everyone’s
play and are looking for a winning
streak in upcoming conference
matches.”

The team win did leave the
Bison with a perfect 1-0 record in the
Patriot League, which will be tested
Monday when the team travels to
Lafayette. Last year the Bison had
no trouble defeating the Leopards
but Lafayette returns five of their top
six singles players from last year.
The doubles team of Jason
Giaquinto and Tom O’ Connor lead
the way after finishing as a runner-
up in the 1990 ECC Championships.
But first, the tennis squad must battle
Rider tomorrow at home.

“FROM THE BASELINE”

The team will have to play
the week without the services of
number four singles and numbre
four doubles player Cris Stenstrom
‘94 who must return home to
Switzerland to pick up his Green
Card...Greg Downing ‘94 has yet
to lose a doubles match, playing
twice with Captain Scott Bank ‘91
and once with Andrew Cantor ‘92

In the first game, Bucknell got

win. Nichols went the entire dis-
tance on the mound allowing the two

Men’s Lax earns
first win of season

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

The Bucknell men’s lacrosse
team split two games this week, de-
feating Holy Cross on Saturday and
losing to Towson State on Wednes-
day. The Bison’s (1-5) first win of
the season came when they crushed
the Crusaders 19-4 behind explosive
offense. They did not fare as well
against Towson, however, who de-
feated them, 23-4.

Against Holy Cross, the
Bison offense came together while
the defense held its opponent to just
four goals on 17 shots. Matt Pearce
*91 and Kevin Roth ’92 led the as-

sault with three goals piece. Tom
Davis ’91, Erik Herrema '93, Doug
DePietro ’92, and Steve Drobny ’94
also contributed to the victory, each
scoring two goals. Matt C 2
and DePietro led the team in assists,
each with three.

Matt Wojnovich ’94 an-
chored the defense in goal, stopping
eleven shots, while allowing only
four goals. Colin Barker ’94 was a
major force in the game as well,
blocking six shots while shutting
down the anemic Crusader offense.

Bison’s first of the year, gave the

April 12

By Mitch Benton
Staff Writer

“A day intended to focus at-
tention on the positive role that
sports can have on the physical and
mental development of young
people.”

That was how Senator Bill
Bradley described Congress’ newly
declared National Student-Athlete
Day, observed this past Saturday,
April 6. Few student-athletes at
Bucknell, as well as in the nation,
exemplify this role better then Kelly
Marsh °91. A 4.0 grade point aver-
age and conference championships
mark the academic and athletic ca-
reer of Bucknell’s 42nd GTE Aca-
demic All-American in the past ten
years.

This senior history major is the
latest in a long line of Bucknellians
who have excelled both on the play-
ing ficlds and in the classrooms. The
school’s total of 25 Academic All-
Americans over the past five years
ranks second in the nation, trailing
only the University of Nebraska.
Last year alone, four Bison scholar-
athletes were honored, leaving
Bucknell ranked third, behind Ne-
braska and Georgia.

A valedictorian with a 4.0
GPA in high school, Marsh was
named All-State in Pennsylvania
three times for cross-country, twice
for track and field and once for
swimming. In choosing colleges,
she was looking for a school in

which the athletes were also stu-
dents, and had narrowed her choices
to Princeton and Bucknell when she
came to Lewisburg to visit. Marsh
claims that she was so impressed by
the track program and the academic
atmosphere, that she never again
considered Princeton.

Apparently she is not disap-
pointed about her decision. “I have
no regrets about coming to Bucknell.
I’ve been happy here and i’ve en-
joyed the Bucknell experience.”
Entering college, Marsh had athletic
goals that included qualifying for the
Eastern Championships, but refused
to set academic goals for fear of
putting too much early pressure on
herself.

Unfortunately she was forced
to wait longer than expected to ful-
fill her athletic goals. At the begin-
ning of her sophomore year, Marsh
suffered a knee injury and was
forced to undergo surgery, which
kept her out of competition for most
of the year.

By her junior year, Marsh had
regained her form and continued to
lead both the Cross-Country and
Track and Field Teams. During that
year she won individual East Coast
Conference Championships in the
indoor two-mile and outdoor 5,000-
meter runs, was runner-up in the in-
door three-mile and outdoor 10,000-
meter, and placed eleventh in the
10,000 at the Eastern Champion-
ships. The year concluded with
Marsh being named the ECC

Kelly Marsh exemplifies student-athlete

Senior history major continues Bucknell’s strong tradition

Scholar-Athlete in her sport as well
as being selected to the GTE /
CoSIDA (College Sports Informa-
tion Directors of America) Univer-
sity Division Academic All-America
At-Large First Team.

Bucknell and Marsh have
continued their award-winning ways
in the newly formed Patriot League.
She joined soccer’s Christina
Baselga ’91 and indoor track and
field’s Lynnette McBride ’91 and
Matt Deardorff 92 in being honored
as top Patriot League Scholar-Ath-
letes.

In this fall’s cross-country
season, the Bison’s co-captain was
the top Bucknell runner in all but one
of the meets. She also led the squad
as the Bison finished third in the
Eastern Championships.

It is in examining a typical day
during that cross-country season,
that one can truly appreciate the
dedication that Marsh needed to
achieve her success.

Her day begins with breakfast
at 8:00 a.m. in preparation for an
early English class. After her
morning classes are finished at
11:00, Marsh must head to the
Freas-Rooke Pool. Her first year she
would use this time for road running,
but since her surgery, she is forced
to do some of that running in the
water.

She would often skip lunch
and use the time following this
workout to do some studying before
an afternoon class that ends at 2:30,

Cycling team reorganizes
with over fifty members

By Lee Lefkowitz
and Tim Peterson

The Bucknell Cycling Club
has experienced a new surge in
membership and participation since
its reorganization last year by Lee
Lefkowitz ‘93. Since then, the club
has strived to meet its three-pronged
goals for providing a forum for any
members of the campus interested in
riding street bicycles, mountain
bikes, or racing any kind of bike.

To date, the club’s growth has
been slow but steady. The fifty or so
recreational cyclists affiliated with
the club can enjoy the camraderie
associated with riding together in a
group. The next scheduled rides are
slotted for this weekend, April 13
and 14, at 1:00 pm, and will leave

from the downhill side of the
Langone Center before meandering
through the surrounding country-
side

Sean Reid ‘94 and Laura
Landsiedel ‘93 will be leading these
rides, which will have a slow to
moderate pace. The terrain is from
flat to rolling, and the rides will
cover close to 25 miles. As usual,
riders are encouraged to wear hel-
mets and everyone is invited to join
the fun.

Aside from the recreational
side of the Bucknell Cycling Club,
there is also a three-man collegiate
cycling team composed of Victor
Tchiprout ‘92, Greg Tall ‘93, and
Lefkowitz. Tchiprout, returning to
the sport after a two-year break, is
hoping to make a successful debut in
Category C collegiate races.

Tall, the other Category C
collegiate racer, is off to a good start
after having won the bike leg of
Bucknell’s Ironman Competition.

Lefkowitz, Bucknell’s only Cat-
egory A collegiate racer and winner
of last year’s West Branch Road
Race, is hoping to repeat again this
year, when the race will be held on
May 11.

When asked about this year’s
edition, Lefkowitz said, “This year’s
race will be much tougher with the
inclusion of a severe two-mile climb,
the lengthening of the race to forty-
eight miles, and the presence of a
very powerful six-man team from
Susquehanna University.”

As the most experienced rider
on the team, Lefkowitz is begining
his sixth season of racing, having
ridden on Mazda’s Junior National
Team in 1989, Gatorade-Michelin in
1990, and currently on the Fuji-
Criterium USA Team based in
Somerville, New Jersey.

Having ridden on such highly
organized teams, he sees some

shortcomings with Bucknell’s pro-
gram: “Basically, a team needs at

least four riders to be effective—one
climber, one sprinter, one time
trialist, and one good all-around
rider. Without that, it becomes much
more difficult to compete success-
fully against some of the larger ten
man squads that can exert near total
control over a race.”

This season, the collegiate
race scene has been marred by race
cancellations at West Point, the Na-
val Academy, and Columbia; how-
ever, the team has taken this setback
well, and is planning to compete in
the West Branch Road Race and the
Eastern Collegiate Cycling
Championsips at the University of
Massachusetts.

In addition to the road riders
and racers, the Bucknell cycling
Club offers the opportunity for the

off-road enthusiast, whether a seri-
Ous racer or a weekend rider who
likes to get muddy.

As a new group, the mountain
bikers hold a great deal of promise
for the future. This past weekend,
the team faired well at the WQWK
Mountain Bike Challenge in
Coburn, PA. Tim Peterson ‘93,
Lefkowitz, and Paul Johnsen ‘91
competed in the twenty-eight mile
long course and finished 41st, 50th,
and 104th, respectively, against a
powerful field of over 300 mountain
bikers from New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Vir-
ginia, and Maryland.

Steve Hunter ‘91, and Steve
Benson ‘92, also competed in the
ten-mile race, gaining some valuable
experience as they finished their first
mountian bike race. After the race,
Benson commented that “the race
was fun, but the bumps and hills

challenged mv stamina.”
Peterson began racing moun-

tain bikes in California this past
summer and found the sport to be a
fun alternative after three years of
racing on the road. Having raced in
the prestigious Big Bear Mountain
bike series and the fall version of the
WQWK challenge last year,
Peterson brings a lot of experience
to a young team that may very well
dominate off-road racing in the
Pennsylvania region within the next
few years.

So far everyone on the team is
optimistic and getting ready for
more races in Lancaster, West
Chester, and Harrisburg. While
mountain bike racing is not yet an
established intercollegiate sport,
Bucknell’s team may be setting a
new trend.

by excelling in the Classroom as well as on the track

leaving just enough time to return
home, drop off her books and head
to the training room. Marsh must
arrive at practice 45 minutes early
due to the special attention required
of her knee.

After her running, which often
reaches ten miles, Marsh goes to the
weight room for lifting and follows
that with an icing session. It is not
until about 7:30 that she can eat
dinner and go to the library. She
usually has to study for between two
and three hours before she can fi-
nally go home and take some time
off for herself, but not much, be-
cause she follows her track coach’s
recommendation of trying to sleep
between eight and nine hours of
sleep a night.

Marsh’s lack of free time does
not seem to discourage her. “I don’t
feel as though I’ve had to make
many sacrifices. Of course the aca-
demics and athletics take up most of
my time, and you can’t spread your-
self too thin. But you also can’t be
narrow-minded, you have to have
other interests.” For Marsh, these
other interests include membership
in the Kappa Kappa Gamma Soror-
ity.

Few colleges in this nation
could be more proud of its student-
athletes on National Student-Athlete
Day than Bucknell. Other schools
would be hard pressed to match the
co-existence that occurs between
athletics and academics at this
school. As a Phi Beta Kappa, a
conference champion and a once and
future Academic All-American,
even fewer individuals would be
able to match the collegiate career of
Bucknell’s Marsh.

Equestrian team trots off
to Penn State tomorrow

By Brenda Rose

The Bucknell equestrian team
has come a long way since its
humble beginnings. It beganas a club
team three years ago, but did not
begin competition until the fall sea-
son of 1990.

The team had a solid season
last year, though it was still building.
But now, the team is at the point it
envisioned when it began. Partici-
pation has increased significantly in
the last year since the team has be-
gun to show. Because of this, there
are many beginners, but this should
serve to ensure the future of this

sport for years to come.

This past Sunday, Bucknell
travelled to Wilson college in
Chambersburg, Pa. for a horse show
in which Bison riders competed on
the individual and team level against
eight other colleges from all over
Pennsylvania.

An intercollegiate horse show
is run differently than any other type
of equestrian competition. The
teams travel to host schools where
they ride that facility’s horses. The
rider receives a horse by a lottery
system and then competes in a divi-
sion based on his or her ability. Not
only do the points a rider receives for

be

tomorrow for another show before regionals next Saturday.

his performance contribute to the
team’s score, but they also determine
if a rider will advance to the regional
show. The next step after regionals
is zones, followed by nationals.

The outcome of determined
training all winter coupled with the
competitive spirit of the Bucknell
riders was a nine point victory over
Penn State and Wilson, two of their
largest rivals of the season. Jocelyn
Perot ’94 contributed significantly to
Bucknell’s finish as High Point
Team by being named Reserve High
Point Rider for the day.

Kelly Kordish ’92 and Karen
Schulte *91 placed first and fourth,
respectively, in the Open Division
while Brenda Rose '94 and Julie
Grammont ’93 were both able to
place second in the Novice division.
Deborah Stumph °94 took sixth
place in the same bracket.

Cathy Retallack ’93 finished
fourth in the Open division. The
Bison dominated the Beginner Di-
visions as Becky Christie ’93, Bev
Shaw '91, Amy Clare ’91 and Katie
Kowalski ’93 captured places one
through four, respectively.

Bucknell will travel fora show
tomorrow at Penn State before
regionals begin Sunday. This year
several Bucknell riders have quali-
fied for regionals and others will
hopefully compete in zones, to be
held later this month

played an integral role in what suc-
cesses the Bison have had.

For the women, Julie Diercks

Dash with a time of 12.62. In the
high jump, Dawn Ellery ’94 won the
event with a height of 5’2”. Carla
De Biasi ’94 won the 100m hurdles
for the Lady Bison with a time of
15.26. Diercks put in another solid
performance in the 100m dash finals
when she fished second with a time
of 12.76. In the 400 meter hurdles,
De Biase finished first with a time of
66.05. Finally, in the second heat of
the 100 meter dash, Diercks finished
second with a time of 12.62.

The efforts of the Bison over
the weekend were mixed, with some
events more impressive than others.

Austin put in several solid
performances to pace the men.
Diercks won several key events for
the women as they struggled to
compete with the tough local teams.
The Bucknell Invite and the Colonial
Relays may have set the tone for the
season as the Bison look to get on
track this season.

Bucknell broke the magic 400

A preview of our nation’s

By Scott Brown
Staff Writer

The leaves on the trees and the
sun shining brightly can only mean
one thing; class attendance will fall.
And with it comes the beginning of
our national pastime, baseball.
Without any further ado, let’s take a
look at the American League:

American League East

Last year the battle in this
conference existed between the
Boston Red Sox and the Toronto
Blue Jays and this year will be no
different. The Jays only lost out to
the Bosox last year by two games,
but General Manager Pat Gillick
more than made up for it this past
off- season by picking up Devon
White from the California Angels
and making one of the biggest trades
of the summer. He obtained second
baseman Roberto Alomar and out-
fielder Joe Carter from the San Di-
ego Padres in exchange for first
baseman Fred McGriff and shortstop
Tony Fernandez. George Bell was
also released.

The addition of White,
Alomar, and Carter gives the Jays
speed, a commodity they have
lacked. Also, without Bell and
Fernandez, Toronto also has chem-
istry, something the team have been
missing for quite a while. :

Along with steady pitching,
some good young talent in Manny
Lee and John Olrecud, and the
coaching of Cito Gaston, this may be
Toronto’s year.

Boston should give the Blue
Jays a run for their money, but a
couple of factors might keep them
down. First of all, the loss of Mike
Boddicker to the Kansas City Royals
loses 17 games for them right off the
bat. Secondly, although Jack Clark
hit 25 home runs last year and will
probably hit more in Fenway Park,
his effect in the clubhouse may hurt
the ball club.

Helping the Bosox, will be a
lineup that hit .272 last season. If the
Red Sox pitching staff, led by the
five million dollar man, Roger
Clemens, can make up for the loss of
Boddicker and match the staff of
Toronto, they still have a shot.

The division is significantly
less competitive after that. Baltimore
looks like they have the most to offer
and with youth may be a team of the
future. They have helped them-
selves greatly by adding power hit-
ter Glenn Davis, who was more than
happy to get out of Houston. Isn’t

everyone? He brings with him 22
home runs, but twice as many home
runs are hit at Memorial Stadium
than in the Astrodome. Dwight
Evans also joins the club and his bat
and experience can help the team.
Lost is Mickey Tettleton in ex-
change for Jeff Robinson, a ten-
game winner for the Tigers last sea-
son. If this team can stay healthy and
pitchers Ben McDonald and Jeff
Ballard can reach their potential this
team could stay competitive.

After that Detroit takes fourth,
almost by default. Cecil Fielder who
last year couldn’t stay away from the
long ball looks like the only thing he
couldn’t stay away from this sum-
mer was the dinner table. The Ti-
gers did get Rob Deer and Mickey
Tettleton bringing them 42 more
home to their already league-leading

172 last year.

But the real story for the Ti-
gers is their pitching. They only re-
tum one starter with a record over
.500, Dan Petry (10-9, 4.45 ERA).
Their number one starter, Jack
Morris, won 15 games last year but
also lost 18. The only sure thing
about this team is that the middle of
the infield will be led by shortstop
Alan Trammell and second baseman
“sweet” Lou Whitaker, as it has been
since 1977,

The battle for the last three
teams in the division will be as close
as the battle for the first two spots,
just not as interesting. Milwaukee
should take the fifth spot, although
the team did very little to improve
its condition in the off season. Look
for manager Tom Trebelhorn to have
an early exit from the 1991 season.

The last two spots will be held
by Cleveland and New York, re-
spectively. The Indians lost Joe
Carter and Cory Synder and replaced
him with their young prodigy Alex
Cole. The Yankees have some big
names—Don Mattingly, Steve-Sax,
Mike Witt—but they need some se-
rious output from Roberto Kelly,
Kevin Maas, and a whole cast of
others even to reach respectability.

American League West

With the acquisition of Tim
Raines and Cory Synder, the only
thing that can stop the Chicago
White Sox from their first division
championship since 1983 is for them
to believe that they don’t belong.
People mention a jinx hitting Chi-
cago like the one Baltimore felt after
its surprisingly good year two years
ago but that should not be the case.

Although young, Jack

b

The Bucknellian

McDowell, Greg Hibbard, Melido
Perez, and Alex Fernandez make
a credible rotation. Young talent
along with proven veterans
throughout the lineup make this
team tough to beat. And if Bo
Jackson can get healthy, who
knows what could happen?

Obviously the team to beat,
Oakland will still win 90 plus
games, but not enough to take the
division. Part of the problem may
be the team’s attitude, as players
seem to be playing only for them-
selves and their pocketbook. They
do have a potent lineup with a
strong pitching staff. If the White
Sox falter, the A’s will be there to
take their spot.

Kansas City will bounce
back from a sixth place finish in
the division to take third, due in
Part to the acquisition of
Boddicker and designated hitter
Kirk Gibson. Also, Kansas City
can never go wrong with George
Brett and look for great things
from Brian McRae.

Fourth through sixth place
will be a battle as all of these
teams have a chance to stay over
-500. Give the edge to Texas due
to solid hitters Ruben Sierra, Julio
Franco, and Rafael Palmiero.
Their starting pitching should be
pretty strong anchored by Nolan
Ryan, Bobby Witt, and Kevin
Brown.

If baseball is mostly pitch-
ing, then California, even in fifth
place, will still be very competi-
tive. Led by their rotation of
Chuck Finley, Kirk McCaskill,
Mark Langston, Jim Abbott, and
Bert Blyleven this team will make
up for its lack of hitting.

Even though Seattle is
picked sixth, it will still be a solid
ballclub. The only reason Seattle
is so low is because the AL West
is the best division in baseball.

The team is led by the 22 year-old

phenom Ken Griffey Jr. Alvin
Davis is still a threat. The twin
towers of Erik Hanson (6-6) and
Randy Johnson (6-10) combined
for 32 of the team’s 77 wins last
year.

Last in the division will be
the Minnesota Twins. They did
litle over the summer to improve
on a team that finished last in the

division last year. Puckett is a pe-

rennial all-star but only Kent

Hrbek could hit 20 homers last |

year. The young pitching staff has
potential, but even it can’t drag the
Twins out of the cellar.

The Senior Circuit has won
three of the last five World Series,
including last October’s shellacking
of the “favorite.” We wont even
discuss the All-Star game track
records of the past decade or the beer
softball Hall of Famers, I mean
DH’s, the Tigers and other teams
have stockpiled in the other league.
But, I digress into my predictions for
the National League.

National League East

I'll start from the bottom and
work my way up just for a change of
pace. The St. Louis Cardinals will
go through more golf balls than
baseballs this season. This team is
so bad that they’ve already made tee
times for late August, knowing
they’ ll be completely out of the race.
Ozzie Smith will have to keep his
fingers crossed for a trade before he
runs out of gold gloves to polish or
else die of boredom. Felix Jose has
to ask himself whether or not playing
everyday is worth being in St. Louis
instead of Oakland.

In all seriousness though, this
team has some valuable arms such
as Jose DeLeon, Ken Hill, and Lee
Smith that some veteran teams might
be willing to make “fire sales” for
come crunch time. General Manager
Del Maxwell might consider carry-
ing a cellular phone in his golf bag
Just in case.

The Phillies have been trying
to build a team around Von Hayes
for the past what must seem like fifty
years to Philadelphia fans. This guy
isn’t that good. Lenny Dykstra is an
All-Star, but that’s about it. The rest
of this team is either past its prime or
will never have one. John Kruk and
Randy Ready are solid players.
Mitch Williams and Roger
MacDowell just need the starters in
front of them to give them a chance.

The next four teams are all a
notch above the aforementioned two
and could be shuffled a variety of
ways.

The Montreal Expos have one
of the most talented managers in all
of baseball in Buck Rodgers, but just
aren’t deep enough, again, to win it
all. The team posseses a little bit of
everything, but nota lot of anything.
The young arms and exciting line-up
will give other teams trouble.
Sophomores Walker, Grissom, and
DeShields are explosive and should
provide newly acquired Ivan
Calderon, along with lifetime Expos
Tim Wallach and Andres Gallaraga
might just stay north of the border
long enough to give Rodgers the ring
he diserves, but not this year.

“We are family” wont be
played in Pittsburgh as long as Barry
“Wa! I want more money” Bonds is
in the clubhouse. His best impres-
sion of Daryl Strawberry even
forced the new Dodger to become
born again. However, Bond’s sheer
talent along with that of Bonilla, and
Van Slyke should keep the team in
contention offensively. Doug
Drabek and Zane Smith offer Man-
ager Jim Leyland a steady ready-
lefty, one-two punch in the starting
rotation. The infielders will miss Sid
Bream’s glove at first as well as
Wally Backman’s versatility. Be-
sides, who’s going to hii lead-off?

The only reason I’m picking
the Cubs for second is because I
don’t want their fans to have to suf-
fer through as post-season they
know they can’t win. This team is
good enough and should win the di-
vision. Manager Don Zimmer will
struggle with himself as to run or not
run himself into and out of innings.
This team is more like his Red Sox
tcams of the late 1970's then his re-
cent Cub teams. Power hitters are up
and down this line-up. George Bell,
Andre Dawson, and Ryne Sandberg
could drive in 95 or more runs a
piece this year. Mark Grace and
Shawon Dunston join Sandberg to
form one of the better defensive in-
fields in baseball. Dave Smith
should prevent Zimmer from getting
those ulcers that Williams caused
him last year as the teams “closer.”
The addition of starting pitcher
Danny Jackson didn’t come cheaply,
but was worth it.

If pitching is two-thirds of
baseball then the Mets are a step up
on the rest of the division. However,
manager Bud Harrelson will develop
a receding hairline watching Howard
Johnson, Gregg Jefferies, and Dave
Magaden play infield. Only this staff
could pitch through this woeful de-
fense. Young middle relievers Doug
Simons and Jeff Innis are the keys to
the division tile. Dwight Gooden’s
arm is 100% for the first time in two
years and should win the Cy Young
Award. The batting order will have
to put its errors behind it when it
comes up to do its sole purpose, hit.
The “clubhouse cancer” is gone to
the left coast, which should steady
the clubhouse a great deal.

National League West

I didn’t realize that they had
decided where to put the new expan-
sion team. Houston, I guess, is a
pretty safe bet. The other profes-
sional teams in the area, such as the
University of Houston and the
Houston Oilers have turned profits.
This baseball team should have con-

sidered scheduling Stanford, Texas,

pastime

and Arizona State instead of the
Dodgers, Giants, and Reds. It’s not
even worth mentioning their per-
sonnel.

Ted Turner should consider
getting out of sports all together. The
Goodwill Games have been a red ink
nightmare. The Hawks might win
more games this summer than the
Braves, but I doubt it. This team is
much improved however. The way
Nick Esasky sees it, they have seven
or eight potential All-Stars in Dave
Justice, Terry Pendleton, and Sid
Bream. If you have to be strong up
the middle to win in this game, than
the Braves are done. Steve Avery
Possesses the tools to be a great
pitcher. Didn’t we hear the same
about Smoltz, Glavine, Lilliquist,
and Pete Smith a few years ago?

(I hope you realize I’m going
backwards again.)

The San Diego Padres will put
people in the seats this season, unlike
the football team with which they
share Jack Murphy Stadium. Tony
Gwynn, and Tony Fernandez are
excellent baseball players. Fred
McGriff should not see a single
fastball in any kind of crucial situa-
tion because the players hitting be-
hind him can’t damage a Spalding
like he can. It’s worth the price of
admission to a Padre game just to
listen to Benito Santiago pop mitts
from over one hundred feet. He
might throw harder than anybody on
their pitching staff.

The San Fransico Giants paid
Bucknell bookstore prices for me-
diocre pitchers Dave Righetti and
Bud Black. Roger Craig might as
well put himself out on the hill and
save the team some cash. It’s a
shame because this line-up is awe-
some, minus departed lead-off spe-
cialist Brett Butler. Will Clark,
Kevin Mitchel, and Willie McGee
strike unparalleled fear in the hearts
of opposing pitchers.

There are too many I’s in
Cincinatti for manager Lou Pinella
to deal with. The babies of the
midwest have their rings to suck on
and will be content to do just that as
they watch the Dodgers win the
west. Jose Rijo’s crying because he
didn’t start opening day is almost as
ridiculous as Joe Oliver’s and Jack
“Second-Half” Armstrong’s walk
outs.

This team is far too loaded not
to win. Tommy Lasorda will have
fun with this team, especially if Orel
Hershiser can take time out from his
busy Pizza Hut and Johnson &
Johnson commercials to rehab his
shoulder and pitch. Jose Offerman
will be talking to himself after his
fourth error, but it doestn’t matter
because the pasta always tastes
sweet when you win.

Golf beats

Lafayette,

With most of the golf world
focusing on this weekend’s Masters,
Bison golfers concentrated on
Lafayette, who defeated them in
North Carolina two wecks carlicr.

burg, inspired Head Coach Tommy
Thompson’s men to “maybe their
best match in a couple of years.”
But, Thompson believes revenge to
be the real motive behind the victory.
“The guys all worked hard on
their games this past week and they
were confident and focused for this
particular match since [Lafayette]
had beaten us down in North Caro-
lina.”

Zack Vogel ’93 is seen here hitting himself out of a sand trap. Led by
Don Hansen ’94 and his match-best 75, the Bison beat Lafayette, 392-

401.

Kearns ’93 opened the floodgates
scoring his first of three runs. Third
baseman Larry Trout '93 also con-
tributed driving home two more runs
on a basehit.

However, the Bison’s lead
was shortlived. Starter Mike Rizzi
’91 suffered from control problems
compounded by defensive errors to
allow the Crusaders to score five
runs in the first to take the lead.

The one run lead was not
enough to discourage the Bison’s
bats. However, a single run in the
second and two more in the fourth
put Bucknell up for good. The Holy
Cross pitchers helped to dig their
Own grave with two walks to start the
fourth inning rally. Second baseman
Mike Koermer °92 then drove in one
run with single, and catcher Mark
Kennedy °92 followed that with a
one-run double. The Bison never
looked back.

Bucknell tallied once in the
sixth inning to keep the Crusaders at
bay, and scored three in the seventh
to ice an 11-7 victory. After the
shaky first, Rizzi settled down to
pitch effectively. He held Holy
Cross scoreless through the fourth,
and got help in the sixth from re-
liever Jack Kazanjian ’93 to insure
the Bison their eleventh victory.
Rizzi got the win, his third, while
Kazanjian picked up his first save.

The Bison pounded out 12 hits
in the game. Roger Ahrens 91 led
the way with three, and Kearns,
Koerner, and Trout each had two.

The women’s lacrosse
team defeated Georgetown 8-7 to
capture their second win of the sea-
son, yesterday.

The lacrosse ladies opened
the first half of the game slowly,
making basic mistakes on which
Georgetown was able to capitalize.
The Hoyas went into halftime with a
6-5 lead.

Head Coach Jennifer Averill
commented, “We were not playing
consistently the whole length of the
field. We did some nice things, but
they came in spurts.”

The second half, however, was
an entirely differently game. The
women were able to make great
connections at midfield and suc-
cessfully shut down the Hoyas with
strong defense in staging their
comeback.

Co-Captain Kristina Haas ’91
remarked, “I think that we matched
up really well with Georgetown and
were able to play a competitive and
aggressive game.”

Leading the way for the Bison
was Dorie Lynn Ellwood °92, who
tallied three goals to raise her team
leading total to 17 for the season.
Co-Captain Julie Goeller 91 con-
tributed two while Allison Arth ’93,
Leslie Why °92, and Jen Kehoe ’94
each had one. Arth scored the game-
winner with 2:20 left in the game.

The Bison men’s and
women’s track teams competed in
the Colonial Relays at
Williamsburg, Va. on Saturday and
the First Annual Springtime Buck-
nell Invitational on Sunday.

At the Colonial Relays, the
Bison struggled to maintain some
consistency in the various events.
Mark Barolo ’93 finished fourth in
the men’s 400 hurdles with a time of
54.93. In the men’s college 4x100-
Meter relay trials, Bucknell finished
third with a time of 1:29.33. Finally,
in the men’s open hammer throw fi-
nals, co-captain Paul Austin ’91
finished third and was an IC4A-
qualifier.

In the final day of the
competition, the Bison finished
fourth in the men’s open 4 x 800 re-
lay classified finals. Jason Cahilly

Ahrens, Koerner, and Kennedy cach
had two RBI’s.

The Bison used different
means to achieve another positive
outcome in the nightcap. Kurt
Waldner °93 pitched brilliantly
holding Holy Cross to three runs on
nine hits while going the distance to
pick up his first win. Unlike the first
game, Bucknell committed no errors
to aid Waldner’s effort. Bucknell
tallied single runs in the first, third,
fourth, and sixth while Holy Cross
scored all three of their runs in the
third inning.

Ahrens had one of the Bison’s
RBI's when he singled home Kearns
in the first. A Holy Cross error al-
lowed the run in the third, and
Koerner drew a bases loaded walk to
pick up an RBI in the fourth. The
Bison scored the decisive run on an
error in the sixth inning. Waldner’s
outing was even more impressive
because it was his first win since his
pre-season shoulder injury and it
demonstated that he has returned to
the fine form he showed in last years
campaign.

The final game of the series
wasn’t quite so successful for the
Bison. They were shut out on four
hits as The Crusders cruised to an 8-
0 victory. Denis Maguire ’93 picked
up the loss, as he and a host of hurl-
ers couldn’t shut down Holy Cross.
The brunt of the Crusaders’ attack
came when they picked up five in
the fourth. The only bright spot for
Bucknell was the play of first

Georgetown to only one goal in the
second half.

Last Saturday the team was
defeated 20-7 by Patriot League ri-
val Lafayette in a game in which the
score represented the Bison’s level
of play. The team was outmatched
by a better Leopard squad.

Bucknell hoped to carry some

two tough losses 6-3 and 4-3.

The Bison will resume Patriot
League play this weekend with three
games against the Fordham Rams.

Lehigh and Hofstra for a double

Hofstra should both be tough, as
they have a fast and aggressive style

Fordham and the powerful offensive
of The Bison should provide for an
exciting confrontation, and this early
season series could go a long way to
determining the Patriot League
champion.

10,000-M, and qualified for the
IC4A’s.

For the women, Bucknell
finished third in the 4 x 100-meter
relay Trials with a time of 48.76, for
an ECAC qualifier. In the women’s
open 100 meter consolation finals,
Tricia Plasko ’92 finished second
with a time of 12:41.

In other action the Bison
were largely erratic, finishing lower
than sixth in most events. The team
struggled to achieve some consis-
tency throughout the event, and, as a
result, never reached their potential.

At the Bucknell Invite, the
Bison fared a little better as they
finished respectably in several
events. In the 3000m steeplechase,
John Lewis ’93 finished second with
a time of 9:43.69. Judd Jarden ‘93
finished third for the Bison with a
time of 9:47.85. In the hammer
throw, Austin finished first with a

throw of 52.59 meters. The nearest
throw was more than five feet
shorter. In the shot put, Austin won

again, with a distance of 14.58 m. In
the pole vault, Joe LaBarge ‘93

An unidentified female stu-
dent was the victim of an attempted
rape Sunday night on a pathway
leading from Roberts Hall to the
Gateways. The attack occurred at
approximately 9:15 p.m. when an
unidentified white male, dressed in
black clothing, accosted the student,
pushed her to the ground, struck her
in the face and then attempted to re-
move her clothing.

According to reports released
by the Department of Security and
Safety, the victim struggled, broke
free from the assailant and ran to her
residence room where she reported
the incident to a friend. The friend,
also an unidentified student, re-
ported the attack to the Office of Se-
curity and Safety, Sunday at ap-
proximately 10:04 p.m.

Officers from Security con-
ducted a search of the entire campus
but were unable to identify or locate
any suspects. The victim, who re-
mains anonymous, has thus far re-
fused to be interviewed by either the
Department of Security and Safety
or area police authorities. This re-
fusal, according to Director Vincent
DeCerchio, increases the difficulty
of the investigation.

A campus-wide Security Alert
was issued Wednesday night by Se-
curity in an attempt to notify all stu-
dents of the possible danger that ex-
ists on campus. Flyers were posted
Wednesday in residence halls and
administrative and academic build-
ings. DeCerchio. decided on
Wednesday to ensure notification of
all students by initiating an all-cam-
pus mailing.

Student escapes from rape

Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian

A Bucknell student walks by the spot where an unidentified white male struck and attempted to rape a
female Bucknell student last Sunday night. An investigation of the case is underway.

In an interview Wednesday,
Janice Butler, director of the
Women’s Resource Center, said, “I
think that this is an example of when
the University is trying to walk a fine
line by being sensitive to the victim
and also alerting the student body.”
She added, “Security made every ef-
fort to offer assistance to the victim,
but if women won’t come forward,
our hands are tied as to what we can
do.”

Butler stressed the need for
victims to come forward as soon as
possible so that the appropriate au-
thorities have a better chance of ap-
prehending the assailants. “Unless
we get reports about this, we can’t
take steps to prevent this from hap-
pening. I encourage all women to
inform someone in the Women’s

Resource Center, Psychological Ser-
vices or Security,” Butler said.

Barry Maxwell, vice president
for administration, discussing the
timeliness of the Security Alert, said
that the decision was “‘a judgement
call by the people involved.”
DeCerchio said the delay in issuing
the Alert was duc to a lack of infor-
mation on the actual incident. “I just
couldn’t accept information from a
third-hand source as correct,”
DeCerchio said.

According to DeCerchio, the
victim was unwilling to release de-
tails on the assault until she con-
tacted Butler Monday night. Butler
said that a draft of the Alert was cir-
culated for comment Tuesday mom-
ing to herself, Barry Maxwell, John
Dunlop and Mike Amarante. Fol-

Take Back the Night march
speaks out against rape

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Yesterday's Take Back the
Night march took on added meaning
in light of the attempted rape behind
Roberts Hall last Sunday. In an
event whose significance and emo-
tion transcended words, rape survi-
vors and those close to survivors re-
lived their pain as well as their ef-
forts to recover.

Take Back the Night is a na-
tionwide event that is run in conjunc-
tion with National Sexual Aware-
ness Month and National Victims’
Rights Week.

At 10:30 p.m. people began to
gather in Rooke Chapel where by the
end of the night there were over 100
people in attendance. At 11 p.m. the

event formally began with a speak-
out where people shared their sto-
ries, read poctry, and discussed the
socictal problems that underlie rape.
Ima McArdle, director of
Susquehanna Valley Women in
Transition which co-sponsored the
march, asked that those who spoke
not be quoted or named in the press,
or elsewhere.

The speak-out was followed
by a Candlelight Vigil and then the
march itself which took the partici-
pants all over campus.

Feminist Outreach co-spon-
sored the event which was overseen
by Amy Durgan ’93 and Jill Myrom
GR.

Myrom explained the purpose
of the march stating, “The night is
nota safe time for women, we’ re try-

IGHT

ing to end this cycle of fear and vio-
lence.” Myrom stressed that it is not
only rape survivors who benefit
from the march, but all women be
cause of the fear of rape that is a re
ality today. “It’s part of the fear too,
women who have never been raped
go to the march and get just as much
out of it.”

One thing Myrom hopes
people realize is that any woman in
the audience could very easily have
been in the place of a survivor. She
said that when she hears the stories
she thinks of times when she has
been in the same situation. “It brings
it home to everyone that they could
be involved, it could easily have
been them.”

Two visitors attacked

By Steve Hoerter
Staff Writer

Michael Riddick ’91 was ar-
rested and arraigned yesterday on
charges in connection with an al-
leged assault that took place early
Saturday morning in front of
Malesardi Hall. According to a
criminal complaint released yes-
terday afternoon by District Jus-
tice Leo Armbruster, Riddick al-
legedly assaulted two men who
performed in the Langone Center
Friday night.

According to Mary Dorsey,
acting associate dean for orienta-
tion and activities, the men were
disc jockeys hired by Bison Pro-
gramming to perform in the Bison.

The men, Daphnis Espinar
and Elias Ladopoulos, both 21 and
residents of New York City, were
attending a party in Malesardi Hall
following the performance late
Friday night when Riddick alleg-
edly accused one of them of at-
tempting to steal a pair of sun-
glasses. The two men, joined by
their friends Yehidie Novoa, 19 of
New York City, and Jean Simon
"94, left Riddick’s residence room
and were attempting to leave the
area when they were allegedly as-
saulted by Riddick and an uniden-
tified male.

According to the report and
from

Statements witnesses,

\ Riddick and the unidentified male

and seriously injured

hit Espinar, causing him to fall
facedown on the ground.
Ladopoulos, as he was attempting
to help Espinar, was then allegedly
punched in the head by Riddick.
Riddick then allegedly attempted
to punch Novoa, who fled the
scene.

Espinar, Ladopoulos and
Simon then left the scene and
phoned campus security from
Smith Hall. Security responded
and, upon arrival, summoned the
Lewisburg Police Department and
an ambulance.

Following interviews with
Police, the victims positively iden-
tified Riddick as one of the men in-
volved in the assault.

Espinar suffered a broken
jaw and Ladopoulos suffered a bro-
ken right ear drum. Both were
treated and released from Evan-
gelical Hospital and will seek fur-
ther medical attention in New
York.

Riddick was arraigned and
charged yesterday with aggravated
assault (first degree felony), simple
assault, recklessly endangering an-
other person, criminal attempt (all
second degree misdemeanors) and
harassment and disorderly conduct
(both summary offenses).

In an interview last night,
Dean of Students John Dunlop said
that the University is still consider-
ing what action, if any, the Univer-
sity will take. wy

Earth Day addresses
future of environment

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

Once a remote, overlooked is-
sue, occasionally the cause for lib-
eral demonstrations, Earth Day has
blossomed into a wide acknowledg-
ment of man’s need to save his envi-
ronment. A variety of speakers, mu-
sicians and students at informational
booths will celebrate Earth Day to-
morrow along with the Bucknell and
Lewisburg communities. The Earth
Day Planning Committee, respon-
sible for Saturday’s activities, will
donate all proceeds to the Chesa-
peake Bay Foundation.

The Earth Day celebrations
will begin at 11:00 a.m. on Swartz
field with an opening prayer, fol-
lowed by introductions by President
Gary Sojka, Lee Idleman, chairman
of the Board of Trustees, and two
students. Throughout the day three
keynote speakers will address envi-
ronmental issues.

According to committee mem-
ber Steve Leshinski ’91, the day’s
celebration will serve three pur-
pos celebration, awareness, and
action.” He said, “You want to be-
come aware of what is going on and
what you can do about it.” In addi-
tion to speakers, student groups will
take part in the Earth Day celebra-
tion by sponsoring alternative activi-
ties. These activities include a kite-
flying contest, a tree hug, and a scav-
enger hunt for children in the Sun-
flower Nursery. Musical acts will
follow all three speeches. The plan-
ning committee will serve free veg-
etarian chili to anyone who brings a
bowl and utensils.

Approximately 50 campus and
local organizations will work the in-
formational booths which will
present relevant environmental con-
cerns. Segments of the University’s
curriculum will be represented at
these booths. One group of manage-
ment students will present a display,
while engineering students will dis-
play a solar powered motor, accord-
ing to Melanie Bengston, assistant
professor of civil engineering.

Although Leshinski claims
Earth Day to be devoid of politics,
several petitions will be circulated.
Clyde Peeling, coordinating director
of Organizations United for the En-
vironment, will briefly address the

crowd to point out the harmful af-
fects of a proposal hazardous waste
incinerator on the area. A petition to
oppose the building of the incinera-
tor will be located at one of the
booths. Also, Leshinski spoke of a
petition to request that courses on
peace be taught at the University,
just as military history courses are
taught to ROTC students.

Prayer will be incorporated
into the day’s festivities, but the
prayers will not exclude any de-
nomination. “I imagine these are
prayers that transcend our religious
differences in a common cause for
the future of the planet,” said Mary
Evelyn Tucker, adviser of the plan-

Flasher confronts | Earth Day
female student

By Bob Minnich
Staff Writer

An unidentified male ex-
posed himself to a female Buck-
nell student jogging in East Buf-
falo Township late afternoon
Monday April 8. Another Buck-
nell student reported the incident
to security shortly afterwards.

The female student was be-
side the Lewisburg Area Joint
Sewer Authority entrance along
River Road when the unidentified
male approached and dropped his
pants.

The victim ran and caught
up with a male Bucknell student
also running along River Road and
told him about the occurrence. The
event happened at approximately
3:45 p.m. and was reported to se-
curity 30 minutes later.

Names of the two students
are being withheld.

The victim described the
man as being in his fifties, with a
grey T-shirt, and driving a grey

was not given a copy of the Alert.

Weddle attributed the proce-
dural error to the fact the DeCerchio
is new and stressed the importance
of “articulating proper procedures to
new staff.”

Weddle explained that stan-
dard procedure requires any office
wishing to issuing an Alert, whether
it be health or security related,
should contact the Office of Student
Life immediately. Weddle said that
as soon as the information has been
verified, Student Life sends the Alert
via Resident Assistants and campus-
wide mailings.

Bucknell security Sgt.
James Middleton went to the scene
and observed the described male.
After seeing Middleton, the man
drove away at high speed.

Middleton stated that there
was a discrepancy in the victim’s
description. He viewed the same
vehicle as the male Bucknell stu-
dent who reported the crime, but
Middleton described the driver as
younger than SO.

East Buffalo Township Pa-
trolman Harold Herman inter-
viewed both students, and the in-
vestigation is continuing.

Vince DeCerchio, director
of security and safety, stated that
he has instituted additional patrols
in that area.

“We've issued a number of
warnings about jogging alone in
the outer rural areas of campus,”
said DeCerchio. “There are ample
areas to jog that are safer. If people
want to jog in these outer areas,
they should jog in pairs.”

in an interview Wednesday, said,
“...the downside [in issuing an Alert
prematurely] is that it heightens fears
and anxieties. On the other hand, the
community needs to know that this
presents a threat to safety.” Maxwell
said that Security and Safety’s deci-
sion to issue a report is made in con-
sultation with “the president, student
life and myself.”

DeCerchio said, “Students
need to be aware that dangers do ex-
ist on campus, and they need to take
the appropriate precautionary mea-
sures so that something of this na-
ture does not happen again.”

ning committee and professor of re-
ligion. Tucker will present a sermon
entitled “Sensitivity to Environment,
Caring for the Earth” at the 11 a.m.
service in Rooke Chapel.

According to Leshinski, Earth
Day, though not favoring any par-
ticular religious doctrine, is naturally
a spiritual event. “I would say it’s
spiritual. It’s a very spiritual day be-
cause I think that the problem we’re
addressing is spiritual,” he said.
Leshinski said that human beings
have to look at their relationship
with Earth “and the way the Earth is
going to respond to us. Because it’s
Earth Day it has to be spiritual,” he
said.

Tucker sees a problem with
the way religions deal with ecologi-
cal issues. “The world religions up
to this point have not concerned
themselves with environmental eth-
ics. They’re concerned with divine
human relationships.”

One of the keynote speakers,
Diane DePuydt, is a member of the
“Council of All Beings” and will
demonstrate ways to harmoniously
live with other species. “She’s going
to do some very imaginative exer-
cises to identify with the natural
word,” explained Tucker.

The first speech of the day will
be given by a member of the Lenape
tribe from Muncy, Dan Bearclaw.
Bearclaw will relate Native Ameri-
can traditions and present environ-
mental crises in the first keynote ad-
dress. Tucker’s husband, John
Grim, assistant professor of religion,
contacted Bearclaw to speak. “He

Durgan echoed Myrom’s sen-
timents, and added that most people
fail to realize the pervasiveness of
rape’s effects. “Rape affects every-
one, it’s not just women. Because at
some time in your life you will ei-
ther be a survivor, or be close to a
survivor, or love a survivor and want
to get closer to that person but your
relationship will be hindered be-
cause of a past act of violence...”

Last night’s activities were
preceded by a movie at 4 p.m. en-
titled Rethinking Rape. The film re-
ported that one in three women will
be sexually assaulted before they
die. It discussed the impact that rape
has on the victim and those close to

gives a pretty good speech,”
Leshinski said of Bearclaw.

For the final keynote address,
Steve Stamos, professor of interna-
tional relations, will speak of the en-
vironmental issues surrounding the
Persian Gulf War.

“His speech will be a political
discussion, but not a political state-
ment. It’s one thing to disagree with
a person’s political discussion but
it’s really alienating to disagree with
someone’s political statement,” said
Leshinski, reasserting that Earth Day
does not center around political is-
sues.

Leon Shenandoah, head chief
of the Iroquois Nation will present,
at the close of the events, a “prayer
for sunset.” At 8 p.m. he and Denise

Iroquois Nationals, will present

Mother Earth,” a presentation spon-
sored by Chi Phi.

The Earth Day Planning Com-
mittee plans to donate all of its prof-
its to the Chesapeake Bay Founda-
tion. According to Marcia
Hershberger ’92, committee trea-
surer, the group chose that particular
fund because of its close link to
Bucknell. Waste deposits from the
University empty into the
Susquehanna which feeds into the
Chesapeake Bay, she said.

Tee-shirt sales will account for
much of the money. In addition, each
organization paid $10 to set up a
booth. A small part of that money
went towards production costs, but
the remainder will go to the Chesa-
peake Bay Foundation, according to
Hershberger.

the victim. It also described that the
charicature of a rapist “is not some
type of a pervert, but it can be any-
one.” One man in the movie ex-
plained that “we all have the poten-
tial... you have to stop and think
‘what am I doing?’”

One important point made
throughout the day’s activities was
that rape affects everyone, and that
no one is immune. Durgan ex-
plained, “I think this is important for
people at Bucknell to participate to-
night because rape and sexual as-
sault happen at this campus far too
often.” This past weckend serves as
a chilling reminder for those who
think that the pleasant confines of
campus will shield them from the
horrors of society.

Speaker stresses need
for Holocaust education

Prosecutor of Nazi “Ivan the Terrible,”remembers victims of Holocaust

By Darren Millman
and Cindy Levinson
Staff Writers

Following a short service
Tuesday evening to commemorate
Yom Hashoah, the Hebrew day to
remember the atrocities of the Holo-
caust, internationally known author
and former head of the Justice
Department’s Office of Special In-
vestigations (OSI), Allan A. Ryan
Jr., addressed the importance of con-
tinued Holocaust education.

In his succinct and moving
speech Ryan stated, “I believe the
Holocaust is relevant for as long as
men and women live on this planet,
because it contains a lesson that we
can never afford to forget. When
hatred and bigotry combine with po-
litical power and technology in a
world of. indifference and timidity,
then the most defenseless among us
will be victimized in the cruelest
ways, and the consequences of that
cruelty will have no end.”

Ryan emphasized that without
Holocaust education, “revisionism,”
loosely defined as the belief that the

events of the Holocaust were fabri-
cated, would become increasingly
difficult to discredit in generations to
come. He explained that such anti-
Semitic ideologies are too ludicrous
to warrant debate, but that it is es-
sential to prove them wrong through
perpetual discussion of the historical
facts.

As a non-Jew, Ryan strongly
cautioned other non-Jews against
viewing the Holocaust as solely a
Jewish concern. To ensure that a
similar mass genocide never again
occurs, he continued, the Holocaust
must be everyone’s concern.

While with OSI from 1980 to
1983, Ryan spearheaded the United
States’ efforts to expose and pros-
ecute Nazi war criminals still living
in the country.

Most notably, Ryan orches-
trated the much-publicized 1981 in-
vestigation and subsequent deporta-
tion of John Demanjuk. Following
his deportation to Israel, Demanjuk
was later convicted and identified as
the infamous “Ivan the Terrible,” the
man credited with turning on the gas
chambers at the Treblinka death

camp.

Although the Demanjuk case
is still the subject of much contro-
versy, Ryan quickly refuted all
claims of false identification ex-
claiming, “I assure you as someone
who has been intimately involved in
that case for a decade, there is no
doubt that the evidence is valid and
overwhelming and that the man is
guilty.”

In a historical context, Ryan
spoke of the anti-Semitic practices
of Congress which allowed an esti-
mated 10,000 Nazi war criminals to
gain asylum in this country. As a
direct result of the Displaced Per-
sons Act of 1948, citizens of those
nations which had close ties to the
Nazi’s during World War II easily
gained admittance into the United
States, while European Jews had
much more difficulty.

“More than seven out of ten
visas by law had to go to those
groups where the extent of collabo-
ration with the Nazi’s was among the
highest in Europe,” said Ryan. It was
not until 30 years later that Congress

Concert committee sponsors
Earth Day musical performers

By Timothy W. Kirk
Staff Writer

The concert committee will be
sponsoring two upcoming cvents
with the $18,000 remaining in its
budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year.
Derek Shields ’92, concert commit-
tee chairperson, gives an optimistic
account of the financial and opera-
tional progress of the committee this
year.

BSG has allotted $10,000 for
musical entertainment during Earth
Day festivities tomorrow, and
Shields believes the committee got
the most for its money by booking
entertainment in four afternoon
slots.

Though rumors circulated that
the Indigo Girls would be scheduled
for this Saturday’s event, Shields
notes that the $10,000 was insuffi-
cient to entice a band of that caliber.
Instead there will be a combination
of acoustic, classic, and even inter-
pretational painting to music this
weekend, and Shiclds describes all
the artists as “extremcly talented.”

Shields points out that losses
sustained from last semester’s Little
Feat concert were $10,000 less than
those from the Squeeze concert held
at Davis Gym a year ago.

He views the committee’s
tions this year as a definite success,
noting that he was contacted by
Little Feat after its concert and was
told by a band member that “it was
one of the best college gigs they’d
played in years.”

Now that the concert commit-
tee reports directly to the BSG ap-
propriations commitice, there will
exista “tighter rein” on finances, and

this should better serve to decrease
further losses. .

“Few people realize the plan-
ning involved in a major college
concert,” says Shiclds. Accommo-
dations for the band, their roadies,
security concerns, and a host of pa-
perwork are all behind-the-scenes
responsibilities which accompany
such obvious tasks as booking and
paying the band. Shields notes the

committee began planning in the
spring of 1990 for the Little Feat
concert held last October.

After Earth Day, the concert
committee is co-sponsoring a gath-
ering with BAC where New Rhythm
and Blues Quartet (NRBQ) will pro-
vide live entertainment. “These guys
are really hot,” says Shields.
“They've been playing together in
New York for 15 years.”

Although as each year goes
by, the “biological solution” contin-
ues to reduce the number of war
criminals still residing in this coun-
try, Ryan emphatically stated that
“we must not let our concern and our
vigilance die with them.”

Ryan urged the audience to
“take from the incomprehensible
crimes of the Holocaust, not bitter-
ness and despair, but resolve and in-
spiration.”

The lecture was jointly spon-
sored by Bucknell Hillel, friends of
Hillel, BSG and COSP.

Campus facility stores

hazardou

By Bob Ritter
Staff Writer

Ever wonder about the small,
high-tech looking compound behind
the Structural Testing Lab, with the
alarms and flashing lights? The fa-
cility, the University’s hazardous
materials storage area, is the result
of five years of planning and con-
struction, and is the most visible cle-
ment of a comprehensive plan to
deal with hazardous materials used
throughout the campus.

According to Director of
Safety Jim McCormick, the $70,000
facility represents the culmination of
“five years of planning, construction
and budget requests.” The result is a
facility which, McCormick said, “is
designed to serve our needs well into
the future, and satisfies the needs of
local, state and federal regulations
for years to come.”

The facility stores both mate-
rials delivered to campus, and waste
materials waiting to be picked up for
disposal. McCormick explained that
“hazardous materials are in use in a
variety of areas on campus,” includ-
ing solvents and other chemicals
used in the chemistry, chemical en-
gineering and biology departments,
inks and paints used in the art depart-
ment, engine cleaning solvents used
by the physical plant, and custodial
products used across campus. “In
just these areas alone, there is a huge
waste stream,” he explained

From the storage area the
waste is picked up by licensed haul-
ers and transported to disposal sites
along the East coast. The newest ad-
dition to the storage area is the con-
tainer for storage of incoming mate-
rials, used mostly for chemisty
Along with the storage containers,
McCormick explained that the facil-
ity is equipped with “all kinds of spe-
cial features to tell if a problem oc-

curs,” including intrusion alarms and
several sensors to measure the tem-
perature and physical conditions
within the storage containers. All of
these detection systems are con-
nected to the Office of Security and
Safety, which can contact off-cam-
pus agencies as needed in “a mullti-
step process,” including a Hazardous
Materials Response team at the
White Deer Fire Company in New
Columbia. Should a problem arise,
McCormick noted that “we have an
unbelievable number of off-campus

agencics” ready to assist.

The safety measures for
chemical storage have been built
into the new science complex, with
“a special set of rooms for hazard-
ous material” in the basement of the
Chemistry Building, designed to
handle the needs of that building and
the new Biology Building. In addi-
tion, the completed Biology Build-
ing will contain a storage area for
low-level radioactive materials used
in the department

McCormick said that the de-
sign requirements for the two rooms
(one cach for incoming and outgo-
ing materials) cost $20,000 before
construction even began, due to the

careful attention given to “the tre-
mendous amount of requirements”
found in local, state and federal regu-
lations.

He explained that the small
amounts of low-level radioactive
materials used in biology labs are
taken by a licensed hauler and dis-
posed at the Federal Nuclear Waste
disposal facility in Hanford, WA. In
addition, all medical and infectious
waste from the department is col-
lected and incinerated.

The storage program is one el-
ement in Bucknell’s comprehensive
program for laboratory safety, which
includes informing students and fac-
ulty of risks and safety procedures.

The program has been very
successful according to McCormick
who said, “Very few injuries have
been sustained by students working
in labs as a result of programs we ini-
uated.”

McCormick feels the most im-
portant role for members of the Uni-
versity community in the hazardous
materials program is “to be aware we
are awarc of our duties and responsi-
bilities with hazardous materials.
{The program} makes Bucknell a
much safer place to teach and Ieam.”

Relief effort fails
to aid Kurds

Refugees are continuing to die
in large numbers, despite the large-
scale rescue campaign by the United
States military. Even though it is not
operating to its fullest capability yet,
the relief effort, which began last
weck, has shown no signs of revers-
ing the deteriorating condition
among the Kurds. If anything, the
refugees’ plight seems to have wors-
ened.

The basic problem in the relief
effort is that supplics cannot be car-
ried overland to the mountain passes,
beyond the reach of trucks unable to
navigate roads of thick mud, where
the Kurds are camped. Pouring in
from around the world, the supplies
are available, but they cannot get
where they need to go.

Meanwhile, Turkish officials
are encouraging the Kurds to return
home. Turkey is still a developing
country, and the Kurdish-dominated
Southeast is the poorest region in the
country, additionally plagued by
guerilla insurgency and tight mili-
lary security. They are unsure of
how many more people they can al-
low to enter their country. However,
refugees refuse to go back as long as
Saddam Hussein remains in control
of Iraq.

The American military will
continue to carry food, water, and
other material on heavy-load heli-
copters while trying to persuade the
Kurds to come down from the moun-
tains and resettle on more accessible
terrain where supplies can be made
available.

Honda changes
sluggish image

Nobuhiko Kawamoto, presi-
dent of Honda Motor Company and
key member of the corporation’ s tri-
umvirate, has reported many con-
cems since he was elected last June
into his official position. Honda, the
1980’s most successful automaker,
has now slowed in sales, maintains
Kawamoto, and hope for the future
will be contingent upon the hierar-
chy of the company.

From Honda’s beginnings in
1948, the company established
itself as one of the most “demo-
cratic” automakers in the world.
Meetings were held daily to discuss
important production and sales
factors, and integral decisions were
usually made by an average of
twenty to thirty executives.
Kawamoto has publicly claimed
that this approach will simply not
work any longer, as Honda is now
reaching out to other markets, and

the company can no longer afford
to be “conservative and sluggish.”

The cars which are being pro-
duced are of less interest to Ameri-
can buyers; the sports car has practi-
cally overtaken the automobile mar-
ket. Therefore, Kawamoto believes
that the time has come for a more
efficient method of making deci-
sions; specifically, a “kyowa set,” or,
“republican system.”

This is a major adjustment for
such a large company to adhere to,
but Kawamoto and two other top ex-
ecutives, Shoichiro Irimajiri and
Yoshihide Munkekuni, are confident
that they are steering Honda in the
right direction.

Tight recession
hits Europe

After the destruction of the
Berlin wall, Europe planned to have
a spectacular boost in its economy,
with the unified Germany at the
helm. However, Europe is now fall-
ing into a tight recession, spurred by
the war in the Gulf and the problems
which have arisen in the Middle
East.

Last year when the United
States was in a recession of its own,
Europe experienced what is now re-
ferred to as “Europhoria,” believing
that Europe would surpass all other
countries and hold the reins over the
world’s economy. Instead, the
buzzword has now changed to
“Eurorealism,” as the countries in-
volved are forced to confront the
possibility of economic failure.

The country presently in the
worst state is Great Britain and it,
subsequently, is the cause of the sud-
den inflation. Due to the “Thatcher
boom” in the 1980’s, the country
fell into a slump last spring and is
not expected to pick itself up for sev-
eral months.

Karl-Otto Pohl, the president
of Germany’s Bundesbank, has as-
serted that a slow, cautious move to-
ward economic stability is the best
route to take. Many others agree
with him, although several members
of the European Community believe
the recession to be quite temporary
and expect the chaotic state of the
economy to bounce back in a short
time.

EC lifts sanctions

European Community publicly an-
nounced the decision to raise their
sanctions against South Africa.
This would cause the five-year ban

on imports of gold coins, iron and
steel to become obsolete, and to pro-
vide aid to the struggling South Af-
rican economy.

The United States was weary
of this plan, as officials asserted that
South Africa would receive no posi-
tive action from the U.S. until all five
conditions which must be completed
to remove the sanctions are enacted;
namely, repealing state-of-emer-
gency regulations, legalizing once-
banned opposition political parties,
entering negotiations with represen-
tative political groups, freeing all
political prisoners, and repealing
laws that classify people by race.
Although Pretoria has complied with
three of these regulations, Congress
is still not ready to follow the lead of
the European Community.

The world-wide opinion on
this move consists of hesitant sup-
port. While many feel that the Euro-
pean Community has correctly re-
warded South Africa for complying
with most of the sanctions, others are
unsure of the exact implications of
the bold new action. The European
nations, however, feel quite confi-
dent and are willing to stand by their
decision.

Honor Investiga-
tion Continues

The Honor Commission at
Gettysburg College is continuing its
investigation of the Honor Code
with a survey to be distributed to
certain classes this week.

Fearful that students would
throw the surveys into the nearest
recycling bins from their mailboxes,
the Honor Commission asked fac-
ulty to set aside some time during
classes next week for students to fill
out the surveys. Faculty have also
been asked to fill out the report.

Gettysburg’s Commission is
hoping that as many students as pos-
sible will fill out the survey, so they
can put an end to the Honor Code
investigation and find a solution
soon. —The Gettysburgian

Private college
tuition increases

Tuition is rising in many pri-
vate colleges across the country,
causing great concem to current and
future college students. On March
15, all Denison parents received a
letter outlining an 8.3% tuition in-
crease for the 1991-92 academic
year. This means that tuition and
fees will rise to $14,700 from
$13,510, while room and board will
change from $3,740 to $3,980.

The main reason for this rise
in tuition is an increase in the sala-
ries and benefits for faculty and staff.
Denison remains in the bottom third
of fifteen other institutions similar in
structure when comparing profes-
sors’ salaries. Their total revenue
now places 60% for salaries, 20%
for financial aid, and the remaining
20% for significant increases in

IUDs safer than
once believed

A recent study published by
Dr. Richard Kronman and his asso-
ciates asserts that the past informa-
tion regarding the safety of IUDs has
been incorrect. His new findings
have uncovered that although IUD’s
are not the most desirable
contraceptievs (they are chosen by
3% of women today, less than half
the number in 1982), they are cer-
tainly not as dangerous as they were
once believed to be.

Kronman specifically cites
the Dalkon Shield incident dating
back to the 1970’s. The Women’s
Health Study, published in 1981,
was one of the biggest upsets in that
case, and Kronman now states that
their findings were inconclusive and
poorly conducted.

Kronman further claims that
their previous finding were very sub-
jective, especially with all the nega-
tive media surrounding the Dalkon
Shield incident which occurred si-
multaneously with the study.

The American College of Ob-

stetricians and Gynecologists are
praising Kronman and declaring that
his is probably the most well-in-
formed and solid piece of work on
intrauterine devices which has yet
been conducted.

Although the study does not
find IUDs to be completely free
from causing internal problems,
Kronman concludes that this could
be due to the user and not the prod-
uct.

However, a debate will surely
arise from the two conflicting stud-
ies, and the millions of women who
have been negatively affected by the
contraceptives.

Additionally, it is interesting
to note other countries’ contracep-
tive preferences; in China, 40% of all
women use IUDs, and 21% of all
Scandinavian women choose this
form of pregnancy prevention.

The most controversial issue
surrounding the IUD is the simple
fact that although it has been proven
to work effectively, scientists cannot
explain why it works. If this knowl-
edge were brought to light, perhaps
future studies could be less contro-
versial and more conclusive.

costs for health care, utilities, and
postage.

There have also been several
cutbacks in administrative areas at
Denison to upgrade professor sala-
ries. University officials promise
that financial aid will not be jeopar-
dized by the increase. President
Myers explained that if the institu-
tion did not provide financial aid,
there would be no need for an in-
crease. However, she, as well as
other officials, worry that Denison
will become a school for the rich.
Myers knows that sacrifices must be
made for students to attend their col-
lege, but feels the outcome is well
worth the price. —The Denisonian

MA law requires
crime reports

A law requiring all public and
private institutions in Massachusetts
to submit annual reports of campus
crimes to the state department of
public safety, took effect March 29.
Massachusetts is one of twelve states
that have enacted such laws
throughout the nationwide contro-
versy about access to information on
crimes occurring in colleges.

The law, which was passed in
December by the Massachusetts
State House, requires that the infor-
mation contained in the reports be
made available upon request to stu-
dents, applicants, and employees.
The schools must also provide a de-
scription of their security forces and
policies. The federal government
has passed a similar law which will
take effect in September.

The Massachusetts law be-
came effective only two weeks after
the former editor of the Southwest
Missouri State University’s student
newspaper editor, Traci Bauer, sued

the university after the paper was re-
fused access to crime reports. The
administration at SMSU said the
Family Educational Rights and Pri-
vacy Act (FERPA) which protects
student educational records, barred
them from releasing information on
student crimes, and that they would
be denied federal funding if they re-
leased the information.

US. District Judge Russel
Clark ruled that Bauer had a right
to the crime records of SMSU
under Missouri’s Sunshine Law (an
open records law) and that the
FERPA does not apply to campus
police and security records. Clark
also ruled that by refusing to re-
lease the information, SMSU vio-
lated the First and Fifth Amend-
ments to the Constitution.

BYOB Trial
Scheduled at BU

The Inter-fraternity Council
voted unanimously to conduct a trial
of Bring Your Own Beverage
(B.Y.0.B.) policy during Parent’s
Weekend (April 26 and 27). In ac-
cordance with the policy, fraternity
houses will not provide alcoholic
beverages, but guests will be al-
lowed to bring six 12 0z. cans of beer
to designated fraternity parties. In
exchange, guests will receive tickets
which can be exchanged for beer,
one at a time. The IFC stressed that
individual fraternities are not re-
sponsible for reimbursing guests for
any beers not consumed.

The purpose of the trial week-
end is to test these party procedures
and to give the campus a chance to
experience B.Y.O.B. before it be-
comes fully implemented next se-
mester, according to the IFC

Court to review
college bias

The Supreme Court will soon
be hearing a case centered around
the subject of bias on college and
university campuses. Mississippi,
one of the top state-wide “‘violators”
of segregation in higher education,
agrees that the majority of schools
which were attended mainly by
those of one race in the 1960’s are
still following that same pattern.
However, state officials assert that
due to the influence of “tradition,” it
is very difficult for them to regulate
the entrance of minorities.

The major problem arises
when the same segregation laws
which apply to elementary and sec-
ondary schools are applied to higher-
level schools of education, because
the enrollment at these institutions is
not mandatory.

The Mississippi case has been
in Federal Court since 1975, al-
though the appeal is relatively new.
The previous decision resulted in a
vote of nine to four in favor of the
state.

NYC students
protest tuition

Padlocking classrooms and

Other student demonstrations
occurred on six other CUNY cam-
puses, including Hostos Community

Governor Mario Cuomo, would re-
sult in a 60% tuition increase for

Symposium honors geology |Para selected for prestigious
professor Richard Nickelsen summer conducting programs

By Elizabeth Danneberg
Staff Writer

Dr. Richard Nickelsen of the
geology department has recently
been honored the Nickelsen Sympo-
sium on Thrust-Belt Structure and
Tectonics, held on March 15 and 16
in Baltimore, MD. The symposium,
organized by a former student and a
colleague of Nickelsen, consisted of
acolloquium, a banquet, and the pre-
sentation of a prize. In the
colloquium, forty geologists work-
ing in the Appalachian Mountains
read their papers, which required
four different sessions.

The banquet was held on one
of the evenings and attended by sixty
people, including several of
Nickelsen’s former professors. The
presentation of an annual Nickelson
Prize will be accompanied by a still-
to-be-determined sum of money to
the best student with a geology ma-
jor. The creation of the annual award
was a “surprise to me,” Nickelson
stated. Forty Bucknell graduates
contributed to the prize.

Professor Nickelsen, a struc-
tural geologist, came to Bucknell in
1959 after having reccived a Ph.D.
at Johns Hopkins University and
teaching at Penn State for six years.

Christopher Para, assistant
professor of music and conductor
of the Bucknell University Orches-
tra, has been selected to participate
in two prestigious conducting
workshops this summer. One is
the Aspen Conducting Program in
New York, which lasts from the
middle of June to the end of Au-
gust. The other, which takes place
in early June, is the Boulez Inter-
national Conducting Workshop, a
master class in conducting.

The Aspen Conducting Pro-
gram is part of the Aspen School
of Music, “arguably the largest and
most prestigious of the summer
programs in music,” according to
Para. World famous musicians,
including Itzhak Perlman, have
taught there. Para will be in a class
of nine conducting students, cho-
sen out of approximately 160
people who were invited to audi-
tion after submitting an application
and a videotape of their conduct-
ing. The audition consisted of “ear

training exercises and musical test-
ing, such as score reading and pitch
identification,” Para said, as well as
a live conducting audition. Murray
Siddlin will be in charge of the pro-
gram, and throughout the workshop,
the class will be taught by several
well-known guest conductors.

Most of the conductors who
participate in the Aspen workshop
are professional conductors or stu-
dents of conducting at music
schools, rather than professors.
Para, who has his master’s degree in
music from the Eastman School of
Music, is the only member of the
class who conducts in a strictly aca-
demic setting. However, he has also
worked as a professional conductor
for various groups, including the
Genesee Symphony in New York,
before coming to Bucknell.

Para is also the first faculty
member in recent history to be se-
lected to attend either of these work-
shops. He pointed out that there is a
large difference between profes-
sional conductors and educators, but,
he said, “I am hoping to end up ina
situation at Bucknell where I can do

both.”

Para hopes to gain both artis-
tic experience and professional
contacts at Aspen. “I will have the
experience of world class musi-
cians guiding me,” he said. “Con-
ducting is as much an art as it is a
craft, and it will help to have input
from several successful people.”

Being invited to participate
in the Boulez program is also a
great honor for Para. He described
Pierre Boulez, the conductor who
is running the workshop, as “a ge-
nius of twentieth century music.”
“A lot of conductors fake their way
through a twentieth century piece,”
Para said, “but Boulez really under-
stands twentieth century music. He
has the ability to grasp what seems
chaotic in a piece.”

When asked if there is any
conductor he especially admires,
Para answered, “I admire so many
things about so many people. I
would like to have the clarity and
precision of Pierre Monteux, the
dynamism of Ricardo Muti, and the
musical understanding of Pierre
Boulez.”

Cinderella earns new respect | Earth Day ’91 offers

Bands new album shows evidence of hard work

By Matthew Wood
Staff Writer

Recalling Cinderella’s debut
album, Night Songs, released in
1985, I would never have imagined
this band could achieve any level
of respectability. Quite truthfully, I
wished they would just go away
like so many other pseudo-Bon
Jovi bands that come and go in
about the same amount of time it
takes a Porsche to go from zero to
60 MPH. But something very un-
expected has occurred, and now I
will make my apologies to
Cinderella in the form of a very fa-
vorable review.

Rather than continue to
pump out trash at the typically re-
pulsive rate, the band obviously
took some time to look at what it
was doing. Their 1988 album,
Long Cold Winter, featured much

improved song-writing and perfor-
mance. In 1991, this marked pro-
gression has continued with their
newest album, Heartbreak Station.

The smartest thing Cinderella
did was steer themselves away from
the pop metal scene where they
started and back towards the roots of
blues-based rock. Let me say this is
no modest task, and Cinderella has
done a commendable job. The new-
found success of the group has defi-
nitely resulted from the hard work
and vocals of lead singer Tom Keifer
who co-produced the new album.
Keifer’s voice never falters, al-
though it is harsh enough to turn off
potential listeners. Also noteworthy
is the consistent and impressive gui-
tar work.

The album’s first single,
“Shelter Me,” which humorously
criticizes bigots and hypocrites of
society, has been enormously suc-

cessful and deservedly so. The sec-
ond single and title track, “Heart-
break Station,” shifts gears to a
very pretty ballad. Keifer has actu-
ally managed to tone down his
voice to a much more desirable
level on this song. One of the nice
things about Heartbreak Station is
that it offers a little bit of every-
thing. The funky “Love’s Got Me
Doin’ Time” owes something to
James Brown, and “Electric Love”
is another excellent modern rock
track.

I like what Cinderella has
done with what basically amounts
to a hard working, blue collar ap-
proach to rock and roll. Heartbreak
Station is hardly an ingenious al-
bum. However, it does offer some-
thing hard to find among compa-
rable modern rock groups—a solid
album’s worth of good music.

live entertainment

By Jon Elliot
Staff Writer

In conjunction with recent
trends in an attempt to save our
Mother Earth, Bucknell University
will join the world in celebrating
Earth Day 1991 tomorrow. In an ef-
fort to better last year’s poor student
turn-out, the Bucknell Concert Com-
mittee, in association with Bucknell
Earth Day Committee, will be offer-
ing the campus a selection of diverse
and stimulating forms of live enter-
tainment for Saturday’s festivities.

Although none of the four
bands contributing to this year’s
celebrations are of Grammy status,
Bucknellians may be in for a rare
treat tomorrow on Swartz Field. The
festivities will kick off at approxi-
mately 11:30 a.m. with the sounds of
guitarist Paul Order. In the tradition
of J.R. Magnan, Order is known to
perform such classics as “Love the
One You’re With” by CSN and
Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville.”
His most interesting talent, however,
is his ability to play the guitar, piano,
harmonica and drums simulta-
neously.

Following Order’s “one-man

band” will be the diverse talents of
Denny Dent and His Two-Fisted Art
Attack. In what is expected to be the
highlight of the day’s festivities,
Dent will incorporate the sounds and
rhythms of pre-recorded music with
his artistic magistry, buckets of paint

Sv

and a bare canvas to create a paint-
ing of the respective musician. Dent
once performed his act upside-down
to the sounds of Stevie Wonder on
the cult television program “That’s
Incredible” and debuted at Bucknell
only a few years ago to the music of

Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon.

After the paint is cleared from
the stage, the crowd will be treated
to an open microphone from which
they will hear poetry readings and
the like of local environmentalist
Clyde Peeling. Local bar favorites
Brenda and the Fender Benders (for-
merly Vito and the Hitmen) will then
provide the sounds of standard rock
and roll cover songs and what will
be sure to get the crowd going for the
day’s final act.

Finishing off the festivities
will be the quite familiar sounds of
the student-based group, Lopes,
Trees and Grass. This group, whose
sets are composed of songs ranging
from cover songs of the Grateful
Dead to Bob Dylan to the Allman
Brothers, is a perfect choice to close
outa day filled with sun (let’s hope),
music and most importantly, infor-
mation regarding the problems the
future holds for our planet and what
we, as responsible human beings,
can do to prevent the destruction of
our earth. So kick off your shoes,
throw on a tic-dye and gather on
Swartz ficld for what will prove to
be a most enlightening experience.

Film opens new doors to a legend

Tne Doors takes a good look at Morrison’s music and personality

By Greg Weyant

Few entertainers have been
able to achieve such legendary sta-
tus as the late Jim Morrison, former
lead singer of the L.A. based rock
band The Doors. In director Oliver
Stone’s latest project, The Doors, the
tale of Morrison’s dramatic rise to
fame and his drunken self-destruc-
tion is re-created in a larger-than-life
biographical epic.

Oliver Stone, having already
had great critical and box office
success with such blockbuster hits as
Born on the 4th of July and Platoon,
takes his audience, once again, back
to those thrilling days of yesteryear,
the ’60s. Stone loosens up with the
camera and takes on the position of
amuch more artistic director than he
had previously with such films as
Talk Radio and Wall Street. This ex-
perimental trend can be seen
throughout the movie, and it is the
cinematography that really makes

The Doors the dynamic picture that
it is. Stone has given the entire pic-
ture an orange tint, subtly giving the
audience the impression that the film
is, like its subject, some twenty years
old. Stone also treats his audiences
to some wild camera techniques
such as one scene in which the band
members take peyote (a hallucino-
genic drug), and Stone interprets the
hallucinations with camera tricks. At
several points in the film Stone trics
such subtle deceptions as swaying
the camera back and forth, slowly
giving the viewer a slightly drugged
or drunken state so that the audience
can see life through Morrison’s eyes.
Stone even uses the classic trade-
mark of the legendary Alfred
Hitchcock when he casts himself in
a small cameo role as Morrison’s
UCLA film school professor.

Val Kilmer (Top Gun, Willow)
gives a riveting performance as Jim
Morrison. Kilmer docs an outstand-
ing job at capturing Morrison’s sen-

sual personality (as much as anyone
other than Morrison himself could).
His movements and his voice are
extremely, almost hauntingly, con-
vincing. During the concert scenes
(some of the most outstanding in the
film), Kilmer grabs hold of the au-
dience with a tight grip almost as if
it had been catapulted back to an
actual concert and were seeing the
“Lizard King” himself. Kilmer
should also receive high praise for
his singing talents. In fact, his vocal
similarities to Morrison were a pri-
mary reason he was selected for the
role. Stone has expertly been able to
fade Kilmer’s voice into Morrison’s
and vice-versa so that at many points
through the picture it is difficult to
tell just who is actually doing the
singing. Beyond Kilmer the acting in
the film is not particularly brilliant.
Kyle MacLachlan of Twin Peaks
fame gives a good performance as
Ray Manzarek, the organist and fa-
ther-figure of The Doors. For some

ridiculous reason Stone decided to
cast ex-punk, now pop star Billy Idol
as one of Morrison’s drinking bud-
dies. Needless to say, Idol should
stick to the music world.
Regardless of the shallow
depth of acting beyond Kilmer, The
Doors is still a very powerful and
disturbing film. Many of the young
Doors fans of today see little beyond
the sex symbol image of Morrison
on a poster or listen to or understand
any of the lyrics beyond the simplic-
ity of “Light My Fire”. Anyone who
knows little about the Doors before
seeing this film will come away from
the theater with a greater apprecia-
tion for who and what the Doors ac-
tually were. The Doors gives us as
good a look as one can get in 1991 at
Jim Morrison’s music, poetry, and
personality that made him, as one
critic once said, “the real life
Dionysus of Rock and Roll.”

ost time
The delay that could have been disastrous...

At this Thursday’s Take Back the Night march, nearly 100 marchers with candles provided
light and a sense of security in the darkness, but, only five days before, a victim of sexual assault
at Bucknell found herself terrified, alone, and in the dark.

The case of sexual assault seems almost foreign to a Bucknell world protected by an impen-
etrable bubble. It is not! Those who believe that the Bucknell campus is entirely safe are danger-
ously mistaken. Bucknellians are not immune from crime, and it is past time they stopped acting
as if they were. It is time for all of community members to exercise more caution.

Perhaps more disturbing is the fact that a campus security alert was not issued until Wednes-
day afternoon; preliminary reports of the assault were received Sunday night. Over a period of
65 hours, students remained uninformed about an incident that was foremost in administrators’
minds.

Why the delay? To begin with, security was unable to confirm the assault until Monday.

Security should have a policy of declaring a preliminary campus security alert which would
inform students that an unconfirmed report of sexual assault has been received. While unneces-
sarily heightening the public’s fears and anxieties might be a problem, it is preferable to danger-
ous ignorance. The Bucknell community needs to know when. there is an increased threat, so
appropriate precautions can be exercised.

In this case, a lack of communication between administrators meant that students were not
notified in a timely fashion. The delay illustrates that necessity of clearly specified and under-
stood policies on issuing Campus Alerts.

Not alerting students to Sunday’s incident until Wednesday is shameful. Had the same
perpetrator attacked again on Tuesday night, the administration would have been clearly negli-

gent in their delayed response.

Should students guilty of violations have their names published?

Welcome to the real world...

By Bob Ritter
Associate Editor, The Bucknellian

During their time at Bucknell, students are supposed to become responsible adults, so that they can face the
“real world.” Being a responsible adult involves, among other things, two important factors: learning to take
responsibility for your actions, and being able to make decisions concerning important matters in your life. Both
of these ideals are dealt a severe injustice by withholding the names of students found guilty of offenses in the
University judicial system.

In the real world, if someone breaks the law, that information is public knowledge. There should be no
special protection simply because the crime takes place on the campus instead of in Lewisburg. Making this
information public will clearly serve as a deterrent for the types of crimes which plague this campus, both in
preventing first offenses and stopping repeat offenders.

An example: a student is found guilty of pulling fire alarms in four different residence halls between the
hours of 3 and 5 a.m. on 12 different dates. Either he must pay a $50 fine and remain anonymous, or he will also
have his name published in a column listing judicial outcomes (similar to the security log). The additional burden
of having his actions become public knowledge, and having to face the several victims of his transgressions
across campus each day, will certainly provide a powerful deterrent the next time he considers pulling an alarm.

Furthermore, students must take responsibility for their own safety, and must be given the information to do
so. Dean Dunlop tells us that the University will protect us, that “if you have a student you believe is a risk, you
get rid of him.” A student convicted of assault after attacking several students in a brutal, unprovoked mob attack
on a fraternity house is currently serving his sentence in the Union County jail, but he is still allowed to attend
classes. What does it take to be “a risk” on this campus? Clearly the University can not be trusted to paternalisti-
cally decide what is best for us.

Such cases, however, are rare. Most crimes on campus, such as vandalism, altercations, and petty theft, are
not enough to get a student expelled, but they are crimes the community deserves to know about. They are also
crimes which often do not involve outside criminal charges. Last weekend, vandals caused several thousand
dollars damage. These costs are paid for out of tuition funds; this is a crime to which all students are victims.

Students should be able to make their own decisions about their personal safety. If you know someone on
your hall has been found guilty of several petty thefts, won’t you be more careful about locking your door? If you
know a student has been in several altercations while intoxicated, wouldn’t you approach him with extra caution
when he is drunk and belligerent? Such information will serve as a deterrent by stopping a possible crime before
it has a chance to take place, and will benefit everyone involved.

Bucknell is a small community, but guilty students will face no further attention than in the real world. The
Bucknellian is no different than any other newspaper, in that these cases will only be covered and prominently
featured to the degree that they are news. If these students do face embarrassment, whose fault would that be, the
newspaper who published the information, or the student whose action violated the standards of the community
and infringed on the rights of other students? Bucknell students often want very badly to be treated as adults. This
is how adults are treated everywhere else—break the law and face the consequences. The Bucknell bubble should
not shield these adults from responsibility for their actions.

LEVVERS TO THE EDITOR

Senior learns to accept
diversity through religion

To the Editor:

By the time this is read,
Jeans Day ’91 will have passed.
Sadly, once again every person
will have had judgement passed
upon them because of the clothes
they wore that day. This is a seduc-
tively easy trap to fall into, and I
confess that I have, in years past,
caught myself doing the exact
same thing.

The two
categories that
seem to have
been defined in
the past are ci-
ther that you
wear jeans to
support the hu-
man rights of
homosexuals
and are as-
sumed to im-
plicitly give approval to their life-
style as well, or that by not wear-
ing jeans, you are assumed to be
homophobic, that is fearful of and
hateful towards those of homo-
sexual orientation.

Asa Christian, I have always
found that this day does not pro-
vide Christians with an avenue to
present the biblical view of this is-
sue. Contrary to what some may
think, Christians do not have the
option to be homophobic. All hu-
mans are created in God’s image
and have intrinsic value, worth,
dignity and rights. God is con-
cerned with justice, and it is a per-
version of justice to deny someone
their human rights for any reason.

The Bible commands us to
love the sinner and hate the sin.
This is not only biblical, but it is
also an accepted psychological
principal known as unconditional

All humans are

image and have

worth, dignity
and rights.

positive regard, meaning “I love
you, but I hate what you do.”
Homosexual orientation may not
be wrong in itself, but the homo-
sexual act is wrong according to
God’s standards. But again, that
is not a justification for hate or
fear. All humans have orienta-
tions, that, if acted upon and
carried out are wrong: to lie, to
steal, to harm another person,
and the homo-
sexual act is not
worse than any
of these acts, it
is the same.

Only
through Jesus
Christ can we
free ourselves
from these
things. People
who think Chris-
tianity is just a
list of do’s and don’ ts have missed
the point. It’s a relationship with
someone who loves you with an
everlasting love; one who cared
enough to take the punishment for
my sins and yours. You don’t
have to give up anything to accept
Christ into your life. But once
Christ is in our life, He will gradu-
ally free you from the desire to
commit those acts.

One Christian friend of
mine recently said that she wished
she could wear pants that are one
half jeans and one half not on
Jeans Day. I wish that I could
have done that myself to show that
I care about the rights of all hu-
man beings without condoning
their actions.

editorial stance

To the Editor:

I have often felt that we (my-
self and my colleagues on the fac-
ulty) fail to provide our students
with an adequate education. I have
never been more convinced of this
proposition than when I read The
Bucknellian’s editorial last week
concerning the faculty’s effort to
construct a non-discriminatory drug
policy. It is apparent from this
editorial that we have failed to give
our students even the crudest un-
derstanding of the way in which the
market and our government work.

Before addressing the specif-
ics of the editorial, it is important to
provide a bit of background. As
many people are surely aware, it
has become a popular political
theme in recent years to be “tough
on drugs.” Ostensibly this has
meant crackdowns on drug users
and drug dealers, involving stricter
enforcement of drug laws and
harsher sentences for violators. In
reality, it has meant selecting cer-
tain vulnerable individuals or
groups for selective prosecution
and harassment. For example, the
U.S. invaded Panama and arrested
Manuel Noriega ostensibly for his
ties to drug dealers. In reality the
motivation was that he had been
insufficiently cooperative with the
Reagan administration’s foreign
policy agenda. This fact became
more apparent after the invasion
when the U.S. installed a group of
leaders that were even more closely
involved with international drug
smugglers than Noriega. Other
individuals who’ ve collaborated
with drug dealers, such as Oliver
North, Elliot Abrams, and Henry
Kissinger continue to be respected
figures in media circles and to play

an active role in setting U.S.
policy.

Domestically, this “tough on
drugs” fairy tale has meant singling
out the most vulnerable segments
of U.S. society to be the victims of
harsh drug measures. Specifically,
this has meant creating and enforc-
ing drug statutes to be applied to
the poor and people of color. An
example of this sort of measure is
the federal housing regulation that
allows families to be thrown out of
public housing if any drugs are
used, possessed, or sold on the
premises. As a result of this mea-
sure many poor families across the
country have been rendered home-
less simply because of the allega-
tion that a member of the family
has been linked to drugs. (These
evictions do not require a trial
where the accused are allowed to
defend themselves. The standard of
proof needed for an eviction is the
same that would be needed to ob-
tain a search warrant. An indi-
vidual swearing under oath that he/
she had witnessed drug use is ad-
equate.)

Most of the nation would not
tolerate this sort of “tough on
drugs” treatment directed towards
themselves, therefore politicians
choose to enforce this regulation
against only the relatively poor and
powerless individuals that occupy
public housing. Ostensibly, this
discriminatory treatment is justified
by the fact that public housing is a
privilege provided by the govern-
ment and not a right to which its
tenants are entitled. With the coop-
eration of the mainstream media,
politicians are likely to continue to
get re-elected by periodically

Groups apologize
for questionnaire

To the Editor:

On Monday April 8,
F.L.A.G., the AIDS Task Force,
and Student Medical Services
distributed a campus-wide per-
sonal AIDS questionnaire. Fore-
most, we apologize to the Hai-
tians and Central Africans at
Bucknell. Our personal ques-
tionnaire incorrectly placed Hai-
tians and Central Africans in a
high risk category for AIDS. As
of April 8, 1991, the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) and the
American Red Cross do not
consider Haitians and Central
Africans at any higher risk than
the general population. The
effect of our mistake was, least
of all, to perpetuate a myth that
AIDS is connected to specific

categories of persons. Further,
we did not consider how this
would affect individuals and
groups on the Bucknell campus.
We are sorry.

At the same time we have
learned how poorly educated
most of the Bucknell campus,
including ourselves, is about
current facts regarding AIDS.
Specifically, according to the
CDC and the American Red
Cross, persons are considered at
higher risk simply by having
had any unprotected sex.

A
Different
Drum

By Marc Haimes

As I walked across the UC
Wednesday morning, I was under
the impression that the fabrical sym-
bolism was fairly straightforward:

1. Persons wearing jeans be-
lieve in the rights of all people no
matter what their sexual orientation.

2. Persons choosing not to
wear jeans are not necessarily
AGAINST human rights, but for one
reason or another are not as vehe-
ment in their beliefs.

3. Persons wearing a coat and
tie are Homophobic, Communist,
Left-Handed, Puppy-Hating, Nazis,
and should immediately be killed or.
. . “educated” by the persons wear-
ing jeans.

To my surprise though, the

tions by students was not clear at
all...

First I saw one guy wearing
jeans, but they had holes in them!
What does this mean? It seemed dis-
respectful to me. Is he secretly a
spy from A.H.C.H.A? (I’m not sure
what the letters stand for, but they
sound like phlegm when you say
them all together.) I glared at him
suspiciously. Then there was this
insecure looking freshman who was
wearing jeans, but seemed to be ina
hurry to get down-hill for some rea-
son. And how about the female stu-
dent who was wearing exercise
spandex, but a jeans jacket? I mean,
maybe she still supports human
rights, but had to go to lacrosse prac-
tice or something. Then there was
the guy with the BLACK jeans. No
one ever mentioned what black jeans
meant. And what about the person
wearing the jeans skirt? Or the guy
wearing a team slicker with the name
Gene on it?

Frustrated, I decided to iron-
out (no pun intended) the situation.
I walked across the floor, ignoring

.,.POlicy has prohibited the release of student’s names

By John Dunlop
Dean of Students

The lead statement of a front-page article in the April 5 issue of The Bucknellian suggested that “The debate
over the release of information on campus crime, long a smoldering issue of contention between college administra-
tors and student journalists, has recently been brought into sharp focus by a recent court case...” The reporter, Bob
Ritter, went on to state that a federal judge has held that security information, apparently including the name or
names of alleged wrongdoers, is not protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, com-
monly called the “Buckley Amendment.” Thus, college newspaper editors now can report not only the details of an
apparent criminal incident but also the name of the “criminal perpetrator.”

For as long as I can remember, University policy has prohibited the release of the names of students who are
convicted and sanctioned by the Board of Review On Academic Responsibility or the Committee on Student Con-
duct. With respect to the latter, University policy provides that “Ordinarily, no public announcement of the decision
of the Committee on Student Conduct shall be made. However, the Committee may make a public announcement if
it decides that such notice is necessary to remove a public misunderstanding.” In over 20 years, there has never been
an occasion in which removing or correcting a public misunderstanding required more that publishing the details of
a matter—never the names of students involved.

That long standing policy is exceedingly sound. Historically, the University has taken the position that a
student’s mistake—behavioral mistake—is a private matter between the institution and that individual.

Our position is strengthened not weakened by the judge’s ruling in the case cited in the article in The Buck-
nellian. The judge was dealing with a case involving a public institution. Many such schools have “police” forces.
Bucknell does not. As a private institution, we utilize security and safety specialists, not policemen. Information
gathered by and reports of this department can be “public information” so far as details are concerned.

More importantly, the outcomes of disciplinary hearings are not “public” matters. They are a part of the
student’s educational record and as such are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Informa-
tion from a student’s “educational record” may not be disclosed to a third party without consent of the student.

Even if disciplinary outcomes were not protected by the so called “Buckley Amendment,” there would be or
could be an issue. The issue would be the individual’s right to privacy vs. the public’s right to know. Where public
safety is not endangered, the public has no inherent “right to know.” Publishing the names of student wrongdoers
merely serves as an unintended, additional sanction. Above and beyond official University disciplinary action, the
individual is held up to public discussion, speculation, ridicule or embarrassment. Moreover, there is no evidence
that publishing one’s name in a newspaper serves as a deterrent to repeated misbehavior on the part of the individual
or that it deters others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct. One would hope that would be the case and
that appears to be the paramount argument for full disclosure including identifying individuals. However, there
simply is not data to support a deterring aspect to this practice.

throwing large numbers of people
out on the street for the foreseeable
future.

The lie in this story is that the
“privilege” granted public housing
tenants is not really qualitatively
different from the government
privileges the rest of us require to
stay in our own homes. To take the
most obvious example, virtually all
homeowners take a deduction of
their mortgage interest payments
from their taxes. In many cases
this mortgage interest deduction is
a larger government subsidy than
that received by tenants in public
housing. Since homeowners are a
comparatively powerful group
however, we don’t hear our “tough
on drugs” politicians advocating
throwing them out of their houses if
they’re found to have used drugs.

Furthermore, if we more
closely examine the sources from
which people derive their income
initially, we find the hand of the
government everywhere. For ex-
ample, if someone makes a living
by selling their books, it is only
because the government will jail
anyone who makes a copy of their
book without paying a royalty fee.
The same government privileges
also allow for income from movies,
music, or other forms of intellectual
“property”. Even the very entity of
the modern corporation on closer
examination is revealed to be a
creation of the state, a privilege
granted to private individuals in
order to fulfill a public purpose
(Since forming a corporation is a
privilege and not a right, maybe we

should require mandatory drug
testing for sharcholders as a condi-
tion of receiving this privilege.)
The way in which income is dis-
tributed in this country (as in any
country) is the result of an exten-
sive set of government policies. It
is truly remarkable that so many
people can somehow believe that
the wealth or income that they
possess is somehow a natural phe-
nomenon to which they are entitled
by right, whereas only those who
receive government welfare pay-
ments get privileges. Hopefully,

students who receive government
subsidized loans. They certainly
didn’t suggest applying it to all
college students, a prerogative that
is within the government’s author-
ity as a result of funding that it
provides to virtually all colleges
across the country.

My motion was an effort to
counteract this politically moti-
vated persecution of students from
lower income backgrounds. The
point was simply that if we think
the Pell grant drug policy is a good
policy then let’s apply it to all our

my colleagues on the faculty) fail to

those of our students who come
from comparatively well to do
families will find a more truthful
way to justify their affluence before
they leave Bucknell.

With this background, the
logic of the proposal I made con-
cerning Pell grants should be quite
evident. Pell grants were estab-
lished by the government to give
lower income individuals a chance
to attend college. In the last few
years, our friendly “tough on drug”
politicians, in their usual coward-
ice, decided to apply a stiff no drug
use policy to this comparatively
poor and powerless group. Need-
less to say, these spineless creatures
did not suggest applying the same
standard to the much larger and
more politically powerful group of

S.T.O.P. questions

To the Editor:

Hypocrisy is a major topic of
discussion at our $.T.O.P. meet-
ings, it looms so large in the case of
the Persian Gulf war and in U.S.
foreign politics in general. Most
specifically we want to bring atten-
tion to President Bush’s use of the
Amnesty International reports on
Iraq in order to justify the attack on
that country. None of us would
attempt to justify the attack on that
country. None of us would attempt
to justify Hussein’s actions against
the people of Kuwait or the people
of his own country, his cruelty and
inhumanity are indisputable. Some
questions must be asked, however,
about why the U.S, government
chose just the past year to bring
attention to his actions, and why
they chose to focus on the human
rights violations of Hussein, while
disregarding violations in other
countries.

The name of Sadaam Hussein
may have been a new addition to
most Americans’ vocabulary this
past year, but for Amnesty Interna-
tional he has been a well known
violator of human rights for years.
Amnesty had been working all
throughout the 80s trying to bring
Hussein’s actions into world focus,
but the U.S. government conve-
niently ignored these attempts and

instead chose to accept Husscin and
assist him in his military buildup. It
was not until Hussein took part in
actions that were contrary to the
interests of the U.S. that our presi-
dent finally decided to recognize
and advertise the criminal actions
of Hussein as a way of justifying
the massive destruction that was
being wreaked upon Iraq. For a
government that supposedly loves
human rights so much, so much
that they were more than willing to
blow up a lot of people to get it, I
wonder where their commitment to
human rights were while this coun-
try was supporting Hussein.

We must also ask ourselves,
why Hussein and not others? No
one should be surprised to hear that
almost all the nations in the Middle
East are severe offenders of human
rights, Israel has consistently de-
nied the rights of Palestinians, often
resorting to physical abuse and
murder to keep them from demand-
ing their rights. Yet the U.S. con-
siders Israel one of its closest allies.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey
are all guilty of serious human
rights violations in their use of
torture, extrajudicial executions and
arbitrary arrests. In his talk on
April 15th, Jack Healy, the co-
founder of Amnesty International,
referred to Syria as the mirror im-
age of Iraq in terms of human

students. If not, then why should it
apply to any of our students?

One last point: your editorial
(and President Sojka) implied that
such a policy would be impractical
even if desirable. The story goes,
that if Bucknell goes the first route,
then it will be at a disadvantage in
trying to attract students. If it goes
the second route, then we’ll be
taking money from our law abiding
students to support “criminals”.

Taking these in turn, if we
think the Pell grant drug policy is a
good one and apply it to all our
students, then one might legiti-
mately ask if Bucknell really wants
those students (criminals?) who
would refuse to cooperate with it.
From that standpoint, it would
seem to be beneficial to the Univer-

sity if serious drug abusers or deal-
ers opted to go to one of our com-
petitors.

If we start from the premise
that the Pell grant drug policy is a
bad policy, then we better ask what
it means to take money from our
law-abiding students and give it to
“criminals” who have somehow run
afoul of the government’s Pell
grant policy. If we feel the Pell
grant policy sets a standard that is
inappropriate for those of our stu-
dents who pay full tuition, how can
we then feel justified in seeing
poorer students being excluded
from campus for having been found
in violation of such a policy? Do
we really believe it’s fair that a
student in good standing can be
prevented from completing his/her
senior year because they have been
accused of using drugs in a context
totally unconnected to Bucknell?
Bucknell does lower income stu-
dents a serious disservice if it can’t
make a commitment that they will
be treated with fairness and dignity
once they are here. It would be far
better for the school to admit fewer
lower income individuals and make
a commitment to supporting them,
holding them to the same rules as
our other students, then to pretend
we're helping people by admitting
them and then trusting their fate to
the whims of corrupt and opportu-
nistic politicians and bureaucrats.

rights violations. Yct the U.S. over-
looks these violations, Bush cer-
tainly did not quote any of
Amnesty’s reports on these coun-
tries otherwise we might have to
face the possibility that while we
say we are fighting against human
rights violations we are supporting
them at the same time. The list of
governments supported by the U.S.
that are in fact guilty of extensive
human rights violations does not
end in the Middle East.

For years the government of
El Salvador has been receiving
hundreds of millions of dollars a
year from the U.S. which they use
to keep the military structure in
power and consequently kill, tor-
ture, and “disappear” people in that
country on a regular basis. The
discussion on how the U.S. govern-
ment ignores and often supports the
cruelty of other governments could
go on, but space does not allow for
it. Basically, it must be noted that
the U.S. and indeed much of the
world has been operating on a
hypocritical basis particularly when
engaging in foreign politics. There
needs to be a recognition of a basic
respect for human rights that will
be enforced everywhere, not just in
select countries. This is not to sug-
gest that all the countries that vio-
late human rights should be
handled in the same manner as

Iraq; indeed we would have to blow
up most of the world if that were
the case. It means that as individu-
als and as a collective that we no
longer support governments unless
they work toward eradicating of-
fenses against fundamental human
rights in their country. Jack Healy
suggested that instead of using
bombs we should use strategies like
those used with the Soviet Union,
by being persistent in our investiga-
tions of governments and how they
are treating their people, by in-
specting jails, asking to see prison-
ers, and by “rattling their cages.”
To quote Amnesty International,
“If peace is to emerge from the
present conflict, it can only hope to
endure if it is built on principles
that include a genuine commitment
by every government to the univer-
sal and impartial protection of the
human rights of all people.” War-
time is not the only time when
attention should be brought to
human rights, nor is it the only time
that we must work for peace, as a
matter of fact now is the time that
most of the effort has to be put into
establishing peace and eliminating
the hypocrisy that leads to conflict.

their opposing view point without
leaving any of the original mes-
sages unchanged, F.A.G. is now
free to say legitimately that no one
received their message because of
what was done to their advertise-
ments, and they will probably con-
tinue to advocate their views of
pro-heterosexuality. If no one
interferes with their displays, then
the true opinion of Bucknell will be
shown, and this group can legiti-
matcly be opposed or supported
without interference from any out-
side forces. Both sides of this issue
should be known; when
P.O.W.E.R. suppresses what
F.A.G. has to say they are bringing
themsclves to F.A.G.’s level. It is
better to let someone be heard and
let the public decide for themselves
than to not Ict them be heard and to
present the public with only one
side of the issue.

matter what they are wearing. Un-
less they have white hoods on, or
swastikas shaved on their heads or
something like that.”

“What about people wearing
jeans and a tie?”

“That is perfectly acceptable.”

I made my way to class feel-
ing much better. Now I could
quickly and easily deduce the politi-
cal beliefs of everyone I encoun-
tered. I spotted the insecure looking

freshman from before, except now
he had apparently decided it was hot
out and changed into shorts. I heard
another jean-clad guy explaining his
decision to a friend. “All it means is
that you support human rights,” he
explained, “‘it’s not like I’m...one of
THEM oranything.” I saw a female
student who wasn’t wearing jeans,
but had three pink triangles in a row
on her sweatshirt.

“Wow!” I thought, “She must
be a really enthusiastic supporter of
human rights.”

The Collegiate Perspective
(and other fairy tales...)

By Peter Lalos
Staff Writer

Oh, come on. More com-
plaints about what there isn’t to do
around the greater Lewisburg area?
Must I hold your hand everywhere
we go? Very well,this one’s for
you... GAMES PEOPLE PLAY:
A Guide to the Lesser-Known Rec-
reational Activities at Bucknell.

Second-guessing when the
shower water will turn ice-cold is a
type of game that’s always thrust
upon you. Still, rather than merely
suffering through this phenomena,
why not put on a happy face and get
some competitive use out of it? Lis-
ten for the telltale clinking sounds
in the pipes and be aware of fluctu-
ating water pressure, both of which
usually signal an oncoming flood of
arctic agony. Then, leap out from
under the spray when it comes! If
you're successful, talk trash to the
shower head; if you’re not adept
enough, at least be a good sport and
say something like, “Yes! Good
one... You got me good there...
yep,” through clenched tecth. Re-
member to display fine sportsman-
ship throughout, even though your
privates may begin to shrivel up due
to your lack of skill. Don’t expect
to win this one too often-it’s mainly
for the exercise.

A second amusing diversion
available to B.U. students can take
place when you arrive early to the
lecture hall before class. Bored?
Well, if there’s writing already on
the chalkboard, you’re set. The ob-
ject of this game is to try and figure
out what type of class was in the
room before you, given the clues on
the tablet. Playing time runs from
about five to ten minutes, as by then
the professor usually has erased the
board for his/her own notes. It has
the potential to be a boat load 0’ fun
if you have something like “Sociol-
ogy 320: The Ethics of Deviant Bo-
tanical Studies” in there before you.
Usually a brief game/low entertain-
ment deal, though.

The next game can only be
played during the latter weeks of
the spring semester— It’s called,
“Who can get the deepest, darkest,
richest tan?” No holds barred on
this competition. Players sun be-
tween, during, above, and below
everything from classes to church
in pursuit of the bronze medal.
Problem is, the winners eventually
turn out to be the losers roughly 40
years later, when they transform
into cancerous raisins.

Another timeless, popular
pastime around campus is proudly
sponsored by The Bucknellian ev-
ery week. It involves students lying
silently in wait in the underbrush
for days, perhaps months on end.
Their eyes are sharp, their predatory
senses honed. Then, when the time

PIZ

is optimal, they leap out of the
bushes and strike—pouncing on a
trendy but controversial issue about
which to become obsessively in-
volved! The game can be based on
either a personal vendetta or a
group thing, the latter being where
several different camps of interest
are involved in the flying fur. Dura-
tion of this sport lasts until the par-
ticipants lose interest in squabbling,
which they inevitably do, at which
time they recede back into the
woodwork to curl up and fall back
asleep for awhile. The great thing
about this sport is that anyone can
play.

One of the more challenging
games around the area involves try-
ing to find something to divert your
attention while sitting in the medi-
cal center’s waiting room. Reading
the latest “In View” cover to cover
is acommon strategy for beginners,
but can only get one so far in pass-
ing the hour or so of down-time
while waiting for the doctor.
Rather, the key to victory lies in
losing that inbred sense of self-con-
sciousness and rifling through the
motherlode of venereal disease
pamphlets available in the center;
veterans of the game, who curi-

ously enough are also psychoso- |‘

matics, have mastered this winning
game plan. Jolly good fun.

Lively competition for every
day is guaranteed with “Weather
Watchers.” The object here is to ac-
curately predict the day’s weather
and dress accordingly; and, al-
though this may seem like a simple
enough sport, longtime inhabitants
of Bucknell’s campus will tell you
otherwise. Why? Mostly because
the temperature and front variation
experienced in each 24-hour period
in the Susquehanna Valley is
known to incorporate the weather
of as many as five different climatic
zones of the world at a time. Main
drawback: This game is an acquired
taste, requiring a wide variety of
seasonal clothing and a lot of pa-
tience.

And finally, room picks.
Kind of across between “Scruples”
and pit bull fighting, only more in-
tense. The opportunity for this high-
spirited competition only rolls
around once a year, thank God.
Participants pack as much schem-
ing, jostling, and conspiring for the
prime housing on campus as they
can within the period of about two
wecks, all of which makes for a
rousing good spectator sport if
you’ re a senior or graduate student.
Stakes are high, and pride certainly
is nota prerequisite—in fact, grovel-
ing is often encouraged. Not for the
faint of heart.

And there you have it-all one
needs for a raucous spring. So go
for it-get busy. No, really, go ahead
without me, I’Il just watch,

Journalist brings humor to Gulf War

PJ. O'Rourke tells tales of his personal experience in desert

By Susan Smith
Staff Writer

Nationally known and widely
read humorist PJ O’Rourke “would
have carried water bottles” to be in
the Middle East during the Persian
Gulf War. Instead this journalist for
Rolling Stone, National Lampoon,
Car and Driver, Playboy, and Es-
quire worked as an ABC radio cor-
respondent, supplying war updates

to thousands of Americans as they
drove to work in the moming. He
became a part of “Club Scud” be-
cause of his journalistic ‘‘desire to
see something.” What O’Rourke
saw is the subject of his new book,
Give War a Chance, and also of the
hour-long look at the Middle East he
presented to a full audience Thurs-
day, April 11th in Vaughan Litera-
ture auditorium.

Reporting from the Middle
East proved to be the “sandy 13th
step after the 12th step in the
A[lcoholics]A[nonymous] pro-
gram,” said O’Rourke. Because the
Muslim religion prohibits alcohol,
this was the “first war covered by
sober journalists.” According to
O'Rourke, the quality of the inter-
view questions was Oprah Winfrey
standard at best. Even though
O’Rourke feels that the American
public suffered from bad reporting,
it was not due to a lack of reporters
being allowed to cover the war.

O’Rourke explained that there just
was not enough time on nightly
newscasts to launch into a feature on
the soldiers playing Nintendo to
keep themselves busy until the
ground war started or all the car
wrecks that took place because “of
people looking at the sky instead of
the road during oncoming SCUD at-
tacks.”

It was for these types of tales
that O’Rourke took his “Holiday In

Hell” in the Middle East. As a hu-
morist, he observed everyday situa-
tions and began to make light of
them. The journalists, natives, and
especially the soldiers found that
humor was the best way to remain
sane while surrounded by sand.
O’Rourke said, “certain predictable
types” provided the best laughs. The
Saudis and Iraqis were two of his fa-
vorite targets.

Although there was no crime
in Saudi Arabia (they cut off fingers
for stealing - "an idea that might
work well in New York"), the high-
ways were covered with trash.
Along the desert roads there were
“no lizards with little tongues” just
“blue and pink shopping bags.” The
Saudi’s incredible wealth was also
satirized. The corp of jounalists
joked about “giving a bottle of
champagne to the first person to see
a Saudi lift something heavier than a
dollar bill.” O’Rourke said the Saudi
Arabian national song is “Onward

Christian Soldiers.” Confounded by
Saudi culture as a whole, O’Rourke
figures, “They’ ve got four wives - so
God has already punished them.”
The Iraqis were “best at loot-
ing,” according to O'Rourke. Their
favorite items to steal were televi-
sions and family valuables. Taking
shampoo, cooking utensils, and food
was not beyond them though.The
Hilton hotel from which most of the
journalists broadcasted looked like
“all the worst rock bands had stayed
there at once” after the Iraqis ran-
sacked it. Once the ground war
started though, O’Rourke compared
the battle to “Ohio State against a
Montessori school.” Even though
Iraq had been “fourth on the charts”
for power, there was no comparison
between our army and theirs.
O’Rourke offered much praise
of our Armed Forces. “They worked
in 110 degree weather for five
months, seven days a week, with 18

hours on and 6 hours off-and they
only griped about the food.” Unlike
Vietnam, troops even asked for
General Schwarzkopf’s autograph.

According to O’Rourke, the
Kuwaiti people also thought highly
of the American troops. During their
liberation celebration little girls
wore dresses made to look like U.S.
and Kuwaiti flags and many street
signs were painted over with the
name Washington Street.

After six days of celebration,
O'Rourke thought “Go get a broom
and a mop and clean this country
up,” but instead he and the other
journalists boarded a flight home.
Armed with as many Scotch minia-
tures as his hands could hold and the
airline would supply, he returned to
the United States to tell his tales.
After all, “when the fat man in the
bathrobe (Kuwaiti royalty) comes
back, the war is over.”

Harry’s Grille

20 W. Main Street
Bloomsburg, PA
717-784-3500

WARNING: Do not let
anyone ever lead you to believe
that you don’t learn something
new every day...

Did you know that
Bloomsburg is the only “town” in
Pennsylvania? Julie and Steve
sure didn’t. But thanks to our
courage to drive onward, past the
“Welcome to Bloomsburg” sign,
we found what just might be one
of the best hidden secrets in Cen-
tral Pennsylvania (as far as res-
taurants are concemed anyway)—
Harry’s Grille.

Julie and Steve recommend
the mozzarella sticks ($4.50) as an
appetizer, but are slightly wary of
the peel-and-eat shrimp ($5.95)-
they were a bit difficult to peel for
the peel-and-eat variety.

Julie ordered the Barbecued
Chicken ($11.95) which was ac-
companied by a baked potato
and tossed salad. The entreé con-
sisted of THREE chicken breasts
— too much for even George
Foreman to dine on...and it was
delicious! The baked potato was
of mutant proportions, but the size
did not adversely affect its flavor.
The tossed salad was well-tossed
and colorful.

Steve tried the Grilled

Sas

well...never mind

Salmon ($14.25) which was ac-
companied by a choice of two:
tossed salad, mutant potato, rice
pilaf or pasta with marinara sauce.
Steve selected the salad (very well
tossed) and the pasta. Both were
quite tasty. Steve’s entreé, the
Grilled Salmon, was, as the menu
says, “grilled to perfection”. The
filet, similar to the potato, was of
mammoth proportions.

For dessert, Steve and Julie
decided to share the Turtle Cake
Sundae, a homebaked devils food
cake topped with chocolate chips,
butterscotch, pecans, ice cream
and several other very fattening
ingredients. While it proved to be
quite delicious, Steve and Julie
were simply too stuffed to polish
it off.

We recommend Harry’s
without reservation. The atmo-
sphere is casual, and the food is
great! An excellent choice for
parent’s weekend or graduation,
when all of the restaurants in
Lewisburg are overflowing with
Bucknellians. As Joe-Bob says in
his drive-in movie reviews, Steve
and Julie say check it out!

Softball dominates Mt. St. Mary’s

Fink loses no-hit bid with two out in the seventh inning of the first game of yesterday's

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The women’s softball team
pushed their record to 18-7-1 yester-
day, taking both games of a double-
header against Mt. St. Mary’s, 8-0
and 8-2. Mt. St. Mary’s is the sec-
ond non-conference team Bucknell
played this week as they split a
twinbill with the University of
Maryland at Baltimore County on
Wednesday, winning the first 3-0
while dropping the second 3-1.

In the first game against Mt.
St. Mary’s, Ellen Gabriel ’93 came
up big, poking a two-run single over
short in the third to give Bucknell a
5-0 lead. Jen Kalochie ’91 had a pair
of RBI singles in the 4th and 6th,
scoring Mollie Laubach °94 from
third both times. Kolochie ended the
game 3-for-4 with two stolen bases.

Lisa Fink ’93 proved to be
untouchable on the mound as she
had the Mt. St. Mary batters waving
at her change-up, set up by her

fastball. She had a no-hitter with
two outs of the seventh inning before
allowing a single. She ended the
game allowing just one hit while
striking out twelve as Bucknell took
the game 8-0.

In the second game Karen
Smolskis ’91 hit a two-run homer in
the third bringing Fink in from third.
Smolskis went two-for-two with
four RBIs on the day. Carol Gesler
*93 followed the home run by hitting
atriple in the same area as the homer
by Smolskis, and later coming in to
score.
Sharon Nichols ’91 got the
victory to push her record to 9-3 on
the year. All three of her losses have
been by a 1-0 margin. She leads the
team with a 0.43 earned run average.
Michelle Kofron "93 pitched the last
two innings for the Lady Bison.

“These were some good wins
for us,”said sophomore outfielder
Jill Szafranski, who went two-for-
two in the second game. “It’s going
to get us up for this weekend when

her ninth win of the season, lowering her ERA to 0.43.

Tennis goes in fieldhouse to
defeat the rain and Broncs

By Mike Markovich
Staff Writer

The men’s tennis team fin-
ished a relatively light week of play
yesterday and now must prepare for
a tough upcoming week. This should
prove to be the fullest week of the
season, with matches against
Fordham tomorrow, Lafayette next
Tuesday, and Franklin & Marshall
Wednesday. After these three away
matches, the team will have to travel
once again, this time to Colgate fora
dual match on Friday followed by
the Patriot League Championships
over the weekend.

Play this week was limited
mainly because of the cancellation
of Monday’s match at Lafayette due
to rain; the match was rescheduled
for next Tuesday. The team got an-
other unwanted break on Saturday as.
their home match versus Rider was
moved inside due to rainy Lewis-
burg weather. This prompted the
teams to decide to play the match in
a format in which only four singles
games and one doubles game would
be played. It was also agreed that no
player could compete in more than
one match.

Head coach Craig Reynolds
decided that it would be best to have
Jerome Charlier ’92 pair with Chris
Rimpel ’93 for the doubles combi-
nation in order to give the two some
playing experience together in
preparation for the absence of
Charlier’s normal doubles partner,
Cris Stenstrém ’94, this past week.
Stenstrém left Bucknell Sunday, re-
turning home to Switzerland to re-
ceive his green card. He will return
this weekend in time for the remain-
der of the season’s matches.

The strategy turned out to be a
good one, as Bucknell pulled out a

close 3-2 victory in the match.
Bucknell lost the top two singles
matches, with Bruno Barbera ’94
going down 7-5, 6-4 at number one
and Andrew Cantor ’92 falling 7-6,
6-1 at the number two spot. But the
squad’s lower ranks came through as
Stenstr6m won 6-0, 6-1 at number
three in what Reynolds called “his
best match of the year,” and captain
Scott Bank ’91 was victorious at
number four, 6-3, 6-0.

These essential victories took
the match for Bucknell, as Charlier
and Rimpel had battled back from a
first set loss to capture their match
earlier. They were fighting Rider’s
normal number one duo of Dave
Tanovan and Marc Petchel, who
captured the first set 5-7. But once
Charlier and Rimpel became com-
fortable with each other, they
breezed through the remaining sets
6-2, 6-4.

The cancellation of Monday’s
match at Lafayette left yesterday’s
informal scrimmage with Erie’s
Mercyhurst College as the team’s
only real match play of the week.
Mercyhurst is a Division II squad
with some nationally ranked players,
and Reynolds did not seem surprised
that Bucknell recorded only one
singles victory on the afternoon.

He commented, “Our players
are still very young, so this match
was really only intended as a much
needed workout for this slow week
to work on shot selection and match
attitudes. But it was a good workout
and we’re considering adding them
to our schedule for next year.”

The team begins its rough up-
coming week at Patriot League op-
ponent Fordham’s courts tomorrow.
Reynolds expects a competitive
match versus a Fordham squad
which he notes “didn’t lose any

we have our conference games.”

The Lady Bison took the road
last weckend for a pair of Patriot
League twinbills. On Saturday they
faced the pre-season favorite, Army,
in what turned out to be two gruel-
ing pitcher’s duels.

In the first game Nichols kept
the Cadets off the basepaths and off
the scoreboard for the standard
seven innings, but Bucknell couldn’t
put anything up on the board either
as it was stymied by a three-hit per-
formance from the Army pitcher.
Nichols held out until the 10th, when
Army was finally able to score arun,
winning the game 1-0. Both starting
pitchers went the distance for their
teams.

In the second game of the
doubleheader, Bucknell ended its
scoring drought when Laubach
reached home in the third to give the
Lady Bison a 1-0 lead. The Cadets
bounced right back in their half of
the third when they plated two run-
ners off Fink, to gain an insur-
mountable 2-1 lead. Bucknell
threatened a few times but were un-
able to tie the score, stranding seven
runners on base.

Bucknell woke up the bats on
Sunday against Fordham, as Sza-
franski hit a combined five-for-six in
the two games. In the first game,
Nichols proved to be tough once
again as she gave up only three hits
while striking out ten in seven full
innings of work.

While Nichols was frustrating
the Rams batters, Jen Yuengling ’93
was causing a fracas of her own.
Yuengling scored three of
Bucknell’s eight runs from the lead-
off spot, including a two-run homer.
Fink and Szafranski each had two
hits out of the teams’ eleven. Buck-
nell wound up winning the game in
easy fashion, 7-0.

The second game against
Fordham was nearly a carbon copy
of the first as Yuengling went two-
for-three from the top spot, scoring
and driving in one of Bucknell’s
runs. Szafranski had the big game,
though, going three-for-three in-
cluding a run-producing triple, she

players last year, so should be pretty
respectable.”

Play continues Tuesday with
the rescheduled Lafayette match,
one which Reynolds thinks the team
should be able to win. He expects
another competitive match but calls
the Lafayette team “young and inex-
perienced” and predicts, “If we play
up to our potential, I think we’ll have
a reasonable chance at winning. But
if we have an average or below av-
erage day, as we did against Dela-
ware last week, we’ll get beat.”

The team then faces Franklin
& Marshall on Wednesday before
travelling to Colgate for the three-
day weekend. The Colgate dual
match on Friday, like the Fordham
contest tomorrow, should provide
Reynolds and the team an opportu-
nity to get an idea of the kind of play
it will be seeing from these teams
during the Championship weekend.
The coach sees Army as the obvious
favorite to take league honors, with
Colgate, Fordham, and Lehigh ex-
pected to finish high as well.

As far as Bucknell’s chances
go, Reynolds feels that, “With the
youth and experience level of our
squad this year, we would be very
happy with a third place finish in the
league. I think that is a realistic goal
with the return of Stenstrém and
everyone playing to a reasonable
level of potential. I really see us
fighting with Colgate, Fordham and
Lehigh for the spots below Army,
who is stronger than everyone else.
Our finish will largely depend on our
luck in the draw, which will deter-
mine how often we have to butt
heads with Army early. If we can get
past them without too much trouble,
we should finish relatively
strongly.”

drove in three runs and scored two
on her own.

Despite a bit of a wild perfor-
mance by Fink, she was able to keep
the Rams from scoring, limiting
them to one run. Bucknell was able
to score eight runs off eight hits,
completing the sweep 8-1.

“We really bounced back well
in the Fordham series,” said
Szafranski, “our bats really started to
come alive, and everything seemed
to be working right for us. Hope-
fully, we will win our games this
weekend to move closer to Army in
the standings.”

With the victories over
Fordham, Bucknell moved to 4-2 in
Patriot League play. Bucknell will
look to improve upon its record to-
morrow when Lafayette comes into
town for a doubleheader, with the
first game starting at 1 p.m.

The Leopards are trying to re-
bound from consecutive 6-25 sea-
sons. They will rely heavily on third
baseman Tricia Wolfe who has a
lifetime .335 batting average. Buck-
nell had no trouble with Lafayette
last year, sweeping a doubleheader
from them, 13-0 and 16-6.

The Lady Bison will get to
take on Lehigh on Sunday as well.
Thegame time at 1 p.m also. The
Engineers should not be a terribly
difficult contest either. They are a
young team with eight freshmen and
no seniors. They lost both games last
year to the Bison 3-0 and 4-2.

The Bison will then end their
five-game homestand with a game
against Bloomsburg on Thursday.

CBS sports analyst Jim Nantz
summed it up best when he said,
“This is a great month to be a golf
fan,” (or something to that effect).
He of course was referring to the
Masters in Augusta, Georgia and the
Patriot League Championships in
equally scenic Hamilton, New York.

This weekend the Bison will
travel to beautiful Colgate for the
inaugural Patriot League Golf
Championships. Army, Colgate and
Lehigh are expected to capture the
top three spots with the Bison pre-
dicted fourth. In order for Bucknell
to crack the top three, it would take
“career rounds from our guys and a
less than typical effort from one of
the top teams,” said Head Coach
Tommy Thompson.

“l’m just being realistic.
Those teams [Army, Colgate, and
Lehigh] are so deep and strong. Our
goal will be to break 320 each
round,” continued Thompson.

The format for the weekend
does not provide the underdog with
much of a chance at the heavy fa-
vorites. Two 18-hole rounds will be
played tomorrow and then a final 18
holes on Sunday.

“You can only be six strokes
off after one round, but that snow-
balls intol8 strokes,” said Thomp-
son.

Each school will count its four
best scores out of six for its total
round score. “Depth really comes
into play in tournaments such as this
because if you get three good scores
and three not-so-good scores, you
have to count one of those not-so-
goods.”

That’s exactly the problem
Bucknell had in its most recent
match against Loyola, Western
Maryland and Georgetown last
Tuesday.

Don Hansen ’94 shot another
75 to medal for the Bison while
Doug Dollenberg °94 and Chris
Curti ’94 had 85s. Captain Michael
Smigie 92 turned in an 82. After
that, however, Bucknell was left to
count one of those not-so-goods, an
89.

Loyola took first place with a
solid scholarshipesque 387 and
Western Maryland took second with
a 408, eight strokes better than the

two game sweep

commented Thompson,
“We need more consistency out of
everybody.”

Last weekend, Bucknell trav-
elled to Penn State to participate in
one of the nation’s largest team
tournaments. The Bison played the
blue, or long, tees better than the
white, or shorter length, tee boxes.
The first day placed the team on the
short tees where they shot a 327
four-man total. Perhaps they were
caught up in the Nittany Lions’
spring football practice. Joe
Paterno’s troops took the next day
off, allowing the Bison to concen-

trate on golf. Sunday’s 325 gave the
Bison a tournament total of 652.
Dollenberg was the lone Bison to
break 80 in either round.

Rumor has it that Colgate has
hired the services of Carl Spackler,
the infamous assistant greenskeeper
at the Bushwood Country Club, to
prepare the course for this
weekend’s tourney

Ian Woosnam will pass on his
invite to the tournament in order to
make room for some of the young
aspiring linksters. Bucknell has yet
to break 320 for a four-man score on
a course other than its own. Hansen
could walk away with all-Patriot
League honors if he continues his
excellent play.

The Bison will take on Lehigh

this Saturday, and Jamieson feels
that the team is ready. “Of course
they are always difficult and they are
our main competitors,” he said.
“Now they are on a four-game win-
ning streak, and they feel pretty
confident.” Asked if he felt the Bi-
son could match up, he said, “Abso-
lutely. We can beat them.”

Bucknell is coming off a suc-

cessful weekend against two tough
Patriot League teams, and the team
is beginning to show signs of life.
This weekend it will face a tough
Lehigh team, where experience and
teamwork will be a factor. Lehigh is
led by attackman Ben Ognibene,
who led the Engincers last season
with 24 goals and 22 assists.
Jamieson is confident, however, and
he says that the “new” team is up to
the challenge.

Joe Susan heads to Princeton

By Scott Brown
Staff Writer

i Joe Susan, the Bison football

/ team’s assistant head coach and of-
fensive line coach, has been named
offensive line coach at Princeton.

Head Coach Lou Maranzana
described his reaction to Susan’s
decision to leave Bucknell. “He felt
he had a good opportunity at
Princeton. We will miss Joe. He was
a good coach, but we will have to do
our best without him. We will hire
someone else and do just fine.”

Susan came to Bucknell in
1981 after being a graduate assistant
coach on the football team at Dela-
ware, finalists in the NCAA Division
II playoffs in 1978. Susan’s other
coaching experience comes from
working as an offensive line coach
at Gettysburg College.

He excelled at offensive
tackle when the Blue Hens captured
two Lambert Cups in 1974 and
1976. Both of those teams qualified
for the NCAA Division II playoffs.
He was named Delaware’s offensive
lineman of the year in 1976.

Susan coached cight years
before receiving the added respon-
sibility of assistant head coach
which he shared along with Mike
O'Connor, who was also the offen-
sive coordinator and offensive
backfield coach. These promotions
were made by Maranzana when he
was named Bucknell’s 23rd head
football coach in 1989.

Maranzana has not assigned
anyone to take Susan’s spot as assis-
tant head coach. “The job of assis-
tant head coach was a special thing
that fit Joe as he liked helping out
with the organization and manage-

ment of the team. I can spread out
his responsibilities around the staff.”

Susan left the Bison after they
finished 7-4, their winningest season
in 26 years. In addition, the Bison
amassed 1797 rushing yards, the
most by a Bucknell team since 1980,
the year before Susan came to the
Bison.

The job of finding a replace-
ment has already begun led by
Maranzana and Bucknell Director of
Athletics Rick Hartzell. According
to Maranzana, the search has pro-
gressed well. “We're doing pretty
good. There are a lot of applications.
Within two weeks we will interview
three guys and hopefully we will
have a decision in early May.”

Meanwhile, the Bison team
continues their spring workouts
preparing for its opener in the fall.

While most people in our
nation’s capital were secking shelter
from last Saturday’s cold, steady
rain, Georgetown University hosted
the 1991 Hoya Invitational. The
men’s and women’s track and field
teams from Bucknell, Cornell, and
Penn State joined Georgetown at
Washington D.C.’s Kehoe Field.

Many Bison turned in strong
individual performances, despite not
qualifying anyone for IC4A’s or
ECAC’s. For the women, Dawn
Ellery ’94 captured second in the
high jump, just two inches short of
the winner. Gina Abraham ’93 fin-
ished fifth in the 1500-meter run.
The Lady Bison placed two winners
in the top ten in the 800-meter run.
Kathy Wurster ’94 and Beth Muehl
’94 finished seventh and eighth, re-
spectively. In the 3000-meter run
Kristin Opdyke ’93 grabbed eighth
and Kelly Marsh ’91 twelfth.

On the men’s side of the led-
ger, Tom Wuchenich ’92, John
Lewis '93, and Judd Jarden °93
placed third through fifth, respec-
tively, in the 3000-meter stceple-
chase.

The Bison men managed to
place several athletes in the various
throw-in events. Scott Croasdale ’93
finished fifth in the hammer throw
while Jamie Zapko ’93 won the jav-
elin throw. Pete Gregory ’93 and
Sam Bijlie ’94 earned third and

fourth place finishes in the discus

in the shot put.

Jason Cahilly '92 and Tom
Eagleson ’93 finished sixth and sev-
enth, respectively, only 0.5 seconds
apart in the 1500-meter run. The
800-meter run was broken up into
three separate sections. In the first
section, Norbert Berenyi '91 fin-
ished sixth and Jeff Loomis ’92
eighth. Dave Slupe ’93 won the sec-
ond section while Martin Kondrath

Two weeks ago prior to today,
Bucknell alum, Brian Harshman ’85,
finished first in the Open Division
men’s 5000-meter race at the Colo-

Bison crew travels to West Point

By Kyle Betz

The Bucknell Crew team
traveled to West Point on April 13th
to face Army in a Patriot League
dual regatta. The mens’ varsity four
had little difficulty winning its race,
in 7:07 ; one minute, 16 seconds
ahead of Army. In that boat, Kim
Dobies ’91, coxed Dave Rhodes ’92,
Doug Lebda ’92, Tripp Dixon ’91,
and Kyle Betz 92. As the women’s
varsity eight shoved off the dock late
in the afternoon, the wind on the
Hudson River began to howl and
brought with it large swells.

The women were forced to
Tow upstream in search of calmer
water. Finally, as the two crews
started amist perilous conditions.
The Lady Bison and the Lady
Knights traded the lead several times
in the contest and Bucknell emerged
triumphant in a 1500 meter race,
shortened from the normal 2000
meters due to dangerous conditions.

The men’s varsity lightweight
eight faced an unusual challenge.
They were pitted against Army’s
heavyweight as well as lightweight
eight on the rough water that day.
Staying with the Army crews,
Bucknell finally took third in 7:19
behind Army’s lightweights and
heavyweights who finished in 7:01
and 7:09, respectively.

The men’s novice heavy-
weight and lightweight cights com-

peted together in the same event
against Army’s novice heavyweight
eight. Both Bucknell boats surged
to an early lead over the Army boat
and it turned into a Bucknell vs.
Bucknell face-off. After falling be-
hind, the Bison novice heavyweights
sprinted toward the finish, but
couldn’t catch their lightweight
teammates, who finally won. Army
finished third. The Bucknell
women’s novice eight boat jumped
to an early lead which the Army
women could not match. Bucknell

won with a time of 7:37 and Army
crossed the line in 7:52.

The Army crew team showed
their hospitality by hosting
Bucknell’s team Friday night before
the race on Saturday. They fed the
Bison and gave them a tour of the
West Point facilities on Saturday
morning. The stay provided an
unique opportunity for Bucknell
students to experience life in a mili-
tary academy. Bucknell plans to re-
ciprocate the favor of the Army team
ata home regatta

Bucknell Head Coach John
Skotetis expressed his excitement
over the upcoming LaSalle Invita-
tional on April 20th on the Cooper
River in New Jersey. He is anxious
for his team to row as well as pos-
sible in that important race, which
potentially could grant Bucknell a
seed in the Dad Vail Regatta. The
Bucknell Spring Invitational is
coming up on April 27th followed by
the Patriot League Championships
the following weekend.

Lax sweeps Buckeyes
and Falcons in tourney

By Jamie Diaferia
Staff Writer

The Bison men’s lacrosse
team completed a successful week
end on Sunday after defeating Ohio
State and Air Force decisively. The
team heads to Lehigh for a crucial
game on Saturday.

The Bison were given a pre-
view of what they would take on
when Air Force took on Ohio St..
The game, won by Air Force, went
into overtime before Brian
O’Rourke scored just over a minute
into play for the 10-9 victory

The Bison knew what to ex-
pect when they entered the game
against Ohio State on Saturday.
Having played against some of the
best tcams in the country carlicr this
season, Bucknell was looking for a
quick victory. The game could not
have answered their needs any bet-

game. The « sc

flurry of shots that resulted in five
goals from Doug De Pietro ’92, and
two goals apicce from Kevin Roth
92. Tom Davis °93, and Justin
Zackey ‘94. The Bison were also
once again blessed with solid de-
fense, as Colin Barker ’94 recorded
seven saves on 13 shots and Matt
Wojnovich 94 recorded seven saves
on nine shots.

Bucknell refused to rest on its
accomplishments after Saturday’s
game, when it came back the next
day and worked tirelessly to defeat
Air Force 17-6. This game was
typified by more of a consistent team
effort, with Roth and Davis Icading
all scorers with three apiece, fol-
lowed by two from Zackey, Matt
Pearce ’91, Sureelman, and DePictro.
Sturcelman led all players with three

runs of their own in the bottom of
the seventh to take a 5-3 lead. But,
the Bison battled back in the ninth
inning with a four-run assault. Dave
Koerner "92 ticd the game with a
bases-loaded single be naa Ahrens
got the game-winning RBI driving in
two runs on a single.

For the game Ahrens went 4—
5, coming a home run short of hit-
ting for the cycle. He also drove in
three runs on the day. Three other
Bison had multiple-hit performances
as Mark Kennedy 92, Koerner, and
Steve Gyimesi ’93 cach went 2-for-
5. Jack Kazanijian °93 entered the
game in the seventh inning and
earned the win, upping his record to
4-2.

Bucknell went into last
weckend’s three game series against
the Fordham Rams with great ex-
pectations. Its 12-8-1 record and 2-
1 Patriot League mark gave the team
every reason to believe it could
compete with the powerful Rams.
This early season series would have
a great impact on the final Patriot
League standings.

Saturday’s twinbill was
plagued by the rain which is so
unseasonal for spring in central
Pennsylvania. The Bisons’ defense
was as ugly as the weather in the first
game. Bucknell outhit Fordham 11-
8 in the game, but seven walks by
pitcher Mike Rizzi 91 and five er-
rors by the Bison allowed Fordham
to get optimum production from its
hits.

Fordham got out to an early

cording 15 saves on 21 shots.

Head coach Sid Jamieson was im-
pressed with the quality of the victo-
rics. “We played two good institu-
tions,” he said. ‘Our level of play is
getting better and I think we reacted
well to playing again on Sunday.“
He also said that he has noticed a
definite change in the way the team
has played.

“We are more disciplined,” he
said. “Our transition game is getting
better, and we're getting up and
down the field pretty well.” He had
said earlier that there had been a
problem with maintaining posses-
sion of the ball against some of the
better teams. This has changed, he
said, because of “confidence and
experience.” He added, “People
look like they are more comfortable
on the ficld. Also, because Rick

lead with two runs in the first and
second innings and single tallies in
the third and fourth. The Rams
cruised through the middle innings
and went into the seventh with a
comfortable 8-2 lead.

The Bison made a valiant ef-
fort with three runs in the bottom of
the seventh, but Bill Conklin re-
lieved Jim McDermott for the
“Bronx Bombers” and he finished
off the rally, capping off a 8-5 Ram
win.

Larry Trout '93 led the Bison
with three hits and three RBI's for
the Bison. Dave Koerner '92 and
Roger Ahrens '91 also contributed to
the Bison effort with three and two
hits, respectively. Ahrens also con-
tributed a RBI.

The Bison, however, endured
the continuing rain to capture game
two of the doubleheader. The star of
the nightcap was ace hurler Kurt
Waldner ’93. Waldner went the dis-
tance and posted a five-hit shutout.
Unlike the first game, the Bison
played errorless defense behind
Waldner, who helped himself by
walking only one. Waldner struck
out two hitters on the way to posting
his second win of the season.

The Bison picked up a run in
the first as Steve Gyimesi ’93 scored
on a basehit by catcher Mark
Kennedy °92. Bucknell picked up
another run in the third as Trout
drove in Gyimesi for his fourth RBI
of the day. These two runs were all
the Bison needed as Waldner Iced
them to a 2-0 victory.

Dan Krewson ’91 went to the
mound for Bucknell in the third and
final game of the series. Unfortu-
nately, the Bison made the same
mistakes that cost them the first
game of the series in falling to
Forham 3-0. All three runs Krewson
allowed were uncarned as three er-
rors killed the Bison.

On Wednesday, the women’s
lacrosse team battled East
Stroudsburg University, capturing
another win by the score of 17-8 to
improve its record to 2-8.

The lacrosse ladies took con-
trol of the game from the beginning
taking a 9-3 first half lead over East
Stroudsburg.

Bucknell dominated all as-
pects of the game. The attack dis-
played great movement, as the
midfield created successful transi-
tions between the defense and of-
fense. Defensively, the Bison were
able to successfully hold East
Stroudsburg’s offensive force.

Head coach Jennifer Averill
had a little anxiety going into the
game, but was pleased with how the
women played. She said, “The team
really needed a big win like this to
boost their confidence, and prepare
them for Friday’s game.”

The high scorer for Bucknell
was Sue Wells ’93 with six goals.
Leslie Why '92 and Jen Kehoe ’94
each fired in three, while Dori Lynn
Ellwood "92, Jen Hayes °93, Kristina
Haas ’91, Trisha Way ’91, and Julie
Goeller ’91 each contributed one
goal.

Last weekend, the team trav-
eled to Lehigh where they lost 15-4.
The loss dropped them to 1-2 in the
Patriot League.

Averill thought that the
Lehigh score was not reflective of
the team’s play. “To an outsider, it
looks as if we got beaten badly, but I
think that it was one of our most
competitive and strong games. Our
downfall was our mental lapses at
midfield on which Lehigh was able
to capitalize.”

Lehigh was able to utilize their
fast breaks down the middle of the
field to catch the Bucknell defense

five hits. Jimenez struck out eleven
Bucknell hitters over nine innings to
post his fourth win without a loss.
Ahrens was the only Bison to dis-
tinguish himself, picking up two hits
on the game.

This weekend the Bison will
host the Lehigh Engincers for a
three- game set. Lehigh is probably
the worst team this side of Houston
(Even the Braves would demolish
these guys.) The Engineers have a

tcam ERA of 7.15 that is expected to
increase exponentially against the
strong Bison line-up.

There are a few bright spots
for Lehigh. Head coach Skip Schultz
has said that senior Van Shell,
“could be the best catcher in the
league.” Last year, in only 17 games,
he was able to lead the Engineers in
batting (.310), RBIs (14), total bases
(32) and slugging percentage (.762).

Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian

Mike Rizzi ’91 was the starting pitcher in the opener against
Fordham. His seven walks along with five Bucknell errors enabled the
Rams to go on to an 8-5 Patriot League victory.

Women’s lax crushes East
Stroudsburg for second win

off guard. Goalie Karha Foster ’92
was stcllar in the net, as Haas and
Way were strong defensively. Foster
came up big, making 25 saves in the
match. Kehoe sparked the offense
with two goals while Wells and
Ellwood each added onc.

The Hofstra game was not a
strong display by Bucknell. Averill
remarked, “We simply lacked in-
tensity and enthusiasm. We came
out flat, and our play reflected it.”
Hofstra’s strong and aggressive play
took advantage of Bucknell’s lapse,

taking a 5-0 halftime advantage be-
fore winning 10-5,

Averill also emphasized how
pleased she was with her bench play.
“My bench players came into the
game very assertive and fired up.”
Leading the way for Bucknell were
Kehoe and Sue Signori 93 cach with
two goals while Why scored one.
Foster again played well, making 17
saves.

women will be facing a tough com-
petitor in Villanova at 7 p.m,

prep for policy implementation

Pressure from insurance companies force changes

By Mark Abrahamsen
Staff Writer

Today and tomorrow are des-
ignated as the first weekend of the
University’s “Bring Your Own
Beer” (BYOB) policy at Bucknell’s
fraternities. The purpose of the trial
weekend is to test the new policy
procedures and acclimate the cam-
pus community to a BYOB system
before it is fully implemented, effec-
tive next semester.

BYOB entails that alcohol of
any kind will not be served by fra-
ternities this weekend, and indi-
vidual houses will not be held liable
for potential problems caused by
guests.

The party procedures, which
were drawn up by the Inter-fraternity
Council (IFC), will be as follows:”

A) Guests will have to surren-
der all alcoholic beverages at the en-
trance of the function to a host, who
will transport the drinks to the
fraternity’s segregated (21) section;

B) Guests are limited to one
six-pack of 12-0z. cans of beer (no
bottles). The fraternity is not respon-
sible for returning specific brands to
guests,

C) Guests will receive a ticket
in exchange for each beer (limit six).

D) The guest may enter the
function and proceed to the 21 sec-
tion. At this time he/she will be
proofed for identification and re-
ceive a hand stamp. The guest will
be able to redeem his/her tickets for
beer (one at a time).

Animal behavior program
exceeds federal regulations

By Elizabeth Danneberg
Staff Writer

While the newest regula-
tions under the Animal Welfare Act
of 1985 have necessitated universi-
ties nationwide to improve the liv-
ing conditions of primates under
study, Bucknell’s animal behavior
program will not need to make many
changes.

The primates, which include
approximately 12 each of squirrel
monkeys, red-bellied tamarins, Japa-
nese snow monkeys, and hamadryas
baboons, are housed socially, that is,
within their species, in spacious en-
closures which, “far exceed mini-
mum space regulations”, says Nancy
Caine, associate professor of psy-
chology. It is Caine and Professor
Douglas Candland, the animal be-
havior department chair, who super-
vise the primates.

Primate research is conducted
in several of the psychology and bi-
ology courses, and in addition, Caine
and Candland have been undertak-
ing their own research programs in-
dependently. “The animals are all
used educationally so that students
can learn about animal behavior.
We conduct no invasive research,
that is, surgery, on the primates, and
we do not restrain them except in the
case of a medical emergency. All of
the research is done through obser-
vation alone,” said Caine. :

The animal behavior pro-
gram has done its best to promote the
psychological well-being of the pri-
mates. For instance, the squirrel
monkeys and red-bellicd tamarins,
whose natural habitat is trees, are
housed in outdoor cages abounding
with perches and branches so that
they can jump around. The primates
are additionally permitted to breed,

another source of natural stimula-
tion. “The animals must be allowed
to live the way they ordinarily
would. This poses a big problem for
biomedical research because the ani
mal must be placed in small cages
and injected, therefore causing dis
tress to the animals. So it is these
pharmaccutical research labs which
have to change the most,”
Caine.

said

The only change which the
newest regulations under the Animal
Welfare Act require of Bucknell is
for all lab surfaces to be easily wash-
able. Therefore, the lab’s wooden
walls must be replaced. The univer
sity recognized the need to renovate
the old psychology lab building, and
so these new regulations provided a
further motive. Presently the out
door primate cages are being rebuilt,

will not be responsible for reimburs-
ing guests for any beers not con-
sumed (i.e. no ticket refunds).

F) Fraternities and guests are
required to abide by all applicable
Pennsylvania State, Bucknell Uni-
versity, and Inter-Fraternity Council
alcohol and social policies.

Fraternity presidents decided
to institute the new policy after much
pressure from their national organi-
zations, which found it increasingly
difficult to receive insurance as a re-
sult of the high-risk liability that spe-
cific houses endure. Denis Maguire
°93 president of IFC, noted, “Law-
suits are forcing the issue, but soci-
ety is dictating it as well.”

At this time, no individual stu-
dents nor organizations have ex-
pressed favorable opinions of a
BYOB policy. “No one is really
happy about it right now—students,
fraternities or security. BYOB is be-
ing forced upon us and we are going

through with it unwilling, but the
change is something we must do,”
said Maguire.

Potential problems include
students walking around campus
with open containers as they visit

multiple fraternities. Having stu-
dents carry the alcohol from house
to house increases the possibility of
underage drinking and littering
throughout the campus.

Vince DeCerchio, director of
security and safety, expressed con-
cem that there are many angles to the
issue and a utopian plan would be

difficult to achieve. “I’m really con-
cerned about how this process can be
handled successfully, and if some-
one knows how, that person should
give me a call,” said DeCerchio.
Security will continue to pa-
trol as usual with frequent checks of

Vandals ravage campus,
destroy benches, tables

By Darren Millman
Staff Writer

Vandals ravaged the Bucknell
campus in the early morning hours
on Sunday April 14 causing exten-
sive damage to benches and picnic
tables. According to an initial crime
report, at 12:30 a.m. a student secu-
rity aide observed two students, later
identified as Brian Trainor ’94 and
Steven Fryer ’92, in the process of
overturning a bench in front of the
downhill side of the Elaine Langone
Center.

The report stated that Trainor
and Fryer fled towards the Olin Sci-
ence building where they were ap-
prehended by Capt. Michael
Amarante and Sgt. Donald Mull of
the Dept. of Security and Safety.

Sgt. Hosterman of the East
Buffalo Police Dept. responded to a
call from Vince DeCerchio, director
of Security and Safety, and cited
Trainor and Fryer for criminal mis-
chief. The two are charged with
“recklessly tampering” with two
benches in front of the downhill
ELC,

A hearing for the case has
been set for May 7 at 10 a.m. Both
Trainor and Fryer are pleading not
guilty to the charge, despite the fact
that the crime report explains that
“they stated that they... overturned
two benches in front of the ELC.”

DeCerchio said that the ac-
cused “were very nonchalant about
the whole thing, as if they thought it
was all very funny.”

George Trutt of the Physical
Plant informed DeCerchio that the
total damage done to the benches
would cost the University $289.

DeCerchio added that “within
a one hour period leading up to the
bench incident” vandals hurled four
picnic tables off of the dining hall
patio and destroyed a bench by
throwing it off of Freas Hall. In ad-
dition, numerous benches and picnic
tables surrounding the ELC and the
academic quad were overturned. In
all, nearly $1,500 in damage was
done between 11:30 p.m. Saturday,
April 13 and 12:30 a.m. April 14.

Trainor declined to comment
and Fryer was unable to be reached
and did not return The Bucknellian’s
phone calls. Although DeCerchio
edinitted that he does not understand
the reasons for the rash of senseless
crimes on campus, he did indicate
that most incidents had two points in

common. They are alcohol related,
and they primarily involve under-
classmen.

DeCerchio stated that in order
to stem the proliferation of such oc-
currences “we need a much stronger
and wider education program in ar-
eas of fire safety, vandalism and al-
cohol abuse.”

He urges the campus commu-

nity to report incidents of vandalism
to the Dept. of Security and Safety,
adding that “everyone pays for the
damages. Vandalism is an operating
cost which directly translates to tu-
ition at the end of the year.”

the houses.

Fraternity nationals claimed
potential liability charges and sanc-
tions against the individual Univer-
sity charters as the main cause for
needing a change in the current sys-
tem. This trend to install a risk man-
agement policy for fraternities has
spread throughout the nation, where
a movement has taken place to put
tighter restriction on an individual
fraternitics’ activities. Maguire
noted, “Society’s concern with alco-
hol has increased exponentially with
time, while fraternities have fallen
behind the scope of society in recent
years.”

Whether the trial weekend be-
comes a success or a disaster rests

solely on the individual houses. “It
is a concern that fraternities will be
slow in response to the changes in
the system,” said Maguire. “I’ve
spoken with all of the fraternity
presidents, and my overall impres-
sion is that they will stand strong and
not bend the rules this weekend.”

Five houses will host BYOB-
style parties on Friday: Kappa
Sigma, Phi Gamma Delta, Lambda
Chi, Sigma Chi, and Chi Phi. On Sat-
urday, Theta Chi, TKE, SAE, SPE,
DU, SAM, and KDR will try the new
policy.

After this weekend, IFC will
meet and discuss the need for
changes before next semester, but
Maguire noted that the foundation of
the new policy will likely remain.

future of higher education

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

Across the nation, universitics
are struggling to deal with issues of
price sensitivity and student demo-
graphics, but, according to President
Gary Sojka, the prospect of
Bucknell’s future remains positive.
“We're tuming into a very good edu-
cational value, but the stresses and
strains are going to be apparent,” he
said.

Sojka, in an interview about
the general state of the University,
pointed to student enrollment and
the allocation of budgetary funds as
major issues facing Bucknell. A na-
tional decrease in the number of stu-
dents entering college and a height
ened concern over the cost of higher
education will, for the most part, by-
pass the University, he said.

Student enrollment for the in-
coming freshman class “seems to be
running ahead of last year in terms
of deposits coming in,” and the
University’s decision to increase its
comprehensive fee by only 4.5 per-
cent, the smallest increase in 28
years, is a “bold step” according to
Sojka.

The University has managed
to escape some of the difficult issues
other colleges continue to face

Price sensitivity has become an in-
creasing concern for colleges trying
to balance comprehensive fees and
operating costs. The cost of private
institutions on the whole continues
to rise, and some students answer by
entering public universities.

“Insofar as the price gap be-
tween the privates and the publics
seems to grow, and it seems that it is

continuing to grow, I think more and
more institutions will find them-
selves in jeopardy. We’re already
secing some privates close and we’ re
secing a fair amount of merging in
the private scctor, the result being
that in a few years there will be con-
siderably fewer private institutions
than there are today,” Sojka said.
Sojka spoke of a voucher sys-
tem as a possible solution to an in-
creasing price gap. In sucha system,
the large state subsidies which pub-

help the money?” he asked.

Sojka said that, in general, the
nation is “reaching a critical point”
in providing affordable, quality edu-
cation to all sectors of society. “I’m
sympathetic with the governor; I’m
sympathetic with the legislature,” he
said. Yet Sojka still does not wish to
connect his statements on the issue
to the University. “It’s not a Buck-
nell plan,” he said, “ It is a new way
for people to be thinking about edu-
cation.”

We are not going to back away from our

continuing efforts to make Bucknell a
better place. We are continuing to add
faculty while holding the student body at

a constant level.

—President Gary Sojka

lic schools depend upon would be
split between private and public uni-
versitics, increasing the affordability
of all schools. The system would
also help state governments, which
find it increasingly difficult to ad-
equately fund public schools.

The ratio of poor to wealthy
students at both private and public
schools is roughly equivalent, ac-
cording to Sojka. “I believe the idea
is interesting to kick around and I
belicve it begins to point out how
we're funding higher education...
Should [public universities] be get-
ling significant state subsidies to get

inexpensive higher education when
in fact the state claims that it has
trouble getting enough dollars to

While universities throughout
the nation face problems of student
demographics and increasing tuition
costs, Bucknell has confronted these
same issues. Whereas other schools
in the state have been forced to raise
comprehensive fees, Bucknell has
chosen, instead, to increase the fee
only slightly.

“Interestingly, combined with
that step is a restatement that we are
not going to back away from our
continuing efforts to make Bucknell
a better place,” he said. “We are
continuing to add faculty while hold-
ing the student body at a constant
level,” Sojka continued.

the school affordable to all students

Playground to be constructed
for children of single parents

By David Murray
Staff Writer

If all goes as planned, children
living in Faculty Court will have a
brand new playground to use by
Monday, May 6. Construction on
the project, funded primarily by the
Panhellenic Council, the Inter-Fra-
ternity Council, the Alpha Phi
Omega service fraternity, and one
section of MG101, will begin on
May 3.

The playground will be used
primarily by the children of single
parents who came to Bucknell from
the Community College of Philadcl-
phia (CCP). Twenty-five CCP stu-
dents attended Bucknell last sum-
mer, and several have transferred
here since then. Among them are
Cathy Saabirah
Warthen ’94, both of whom are
single parents living in Faculty
Court. Eight and ten-year-old

Susan Zingale, assistant direc-

new playground will primarily ben-
efit Pino and Warthen’s children.
Before bringing more non-tradi-

said, ‘““We need to make sure we’re

Play equipment currently lo-
cated on the 35 by 37 foot Moore

and decayed, but can be repaired eas-
ily,” according to Scott Shaulis °91,
the project’s engineer. Additionally,
the planned modifications will make
the playground safer. “The old site
had no safety features other than
grass around it,” said Shaulis.
“We're going to put in a cedar mulch
base much like the one at Sunflower
day care center.”

The project’s $1,000 budget
will be divided evenly between con-
struction of a new base for the equip-
ment and refurbishment of the old
apparatus. Shaulis hopes that any
additional monies will be placed ina
fund “to maintain the facility over
time.”

requires increasing funds for finan-
cial aid.

The University’s admit-deny
policy, its promise to provide aid to
all those who need it, is a strain on
existing funds.

The University, to counter the
strains of financial aid and increas-
ing faculty, has made concessions in
certain areas. Barbara Shailor, spe-
cial assistant to the president, will
assume the responsibilities of two
other administrators, both of whom
plan to leave their positions at the
end of the semester.

Shailor will “take over some
of the [tasks] that Tom [Grieves] and
Charlotte [Weddle] were doing, plus
continuing to do some of the things
for me that relate to commencement,
things of that sort,” said Sojka. Ad-
ditionally, Vice President of Aca-
demic Affairs Larry Shinn will
“off-load a few things,” he said.

Sojka said that he hopes the
consolidation will not slow adminis-
trative operations. He did stress the
importance of reallocating resources

to save money for the University.

Student Med Service offers
limited prescription drugs

By Timothy Amman
Staff Writer

The Bucknell student medical
service is now able to fill prescrip-
tions on a limited basis, increasing
the convenience to sick students for
treatment of illnesses.

According to Head Nurse
Nancy Shuck, the student medical
service is “only handling certain pre-
scription drugs and getting them pre-
packaged from All-Scripts.” [All-
Scripts is a nationwide pharmaccuti-
cal distribution company.] Since the
prescriptions are already prepared,
the nurses are not required to have
special training as certified pharma-
cists.

Currently only antibiotics and
eye drops are being given to students
at the campus medical center. Filled
prescriptions are charged to the
student’s Bucknell account balance.

The student medical service
plans to be “expanding health edu-
cation services for the next school
year,” according to Nancy Shuck.
Also, a survey to assess student’s
Suggestions for improvements to the

INTERNATIONAL

India holds na-
tional elections

India’s national elections in
May could change the course and
character of the world’s second most
populous nation, which is currently
in great political ferment at home
and uncertain of its international
role.

The voters will have the
choice between three candidates,
who each represent a different party,
instead of voting simply for or
against the Congress Party, for the
first time since independence in
1947. Other options, besides the In-
dian National Congress Party led by
Rajiv Gandhi, are the Janata Party, a
center-left coalition advocating a
social revolution to break the caste
barriers, and the Bharatiya Janata
Party, a right-wing party with a vi-
sion of a more openly Hindu, less
secular India. The Janata Dal party
is led by V.P. Singh, while Lal
Kristian Advani leads the Bharatiya
Janata Party.

The 1991 election follows
nearly a year and a half of political
turmoil in India. Many feel that the
Congress Party system is not work-
ing, and that India is in need of a

Free Speech
Act is endorsed

If passed, the “Collegiate
Speech Protection Act,” currently
before the U.S. House of Represen-
tatives, will allow students the right
to try to appeal any college or uni-
versity regulation that would punish
them for making so-called “hate
speeches.”

The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) has endorsed the act
so students whose universities do not
have such regulations, will have the
right to appeal.

For example, earlier this se-
mester, a student at Brown Univer-
sity was suspended for two years by
the University for shouting some
drunken epithets against another’s
religion.

There are other ways of ad-
dressing free speech and bias issues
without enforcing speech restric-
tions. The ACLU has recommended
education, through a classroom en-
vironment of social program, as an
option. —The Tartan

Paper Theft At
F&M College

At Franklin & Marshall Col-
lege two weeks ago, all 2,000 copics
of The College Reporter were stolen
from bins in the College Center. No
one has been charged with taking the
papers as of yet.

Vice President of educational
services, Alice Drum, and the direc-
tor of Safety and Security, Glenn
Adamire, began an investigation into
the theft immediately, checking

radical change.

lraqi troops pull
from Kuwait

The American flag now flies in
areas which were former Iraqi out-
posts above Zakho. During the past
weeks, the American Military has
managed to set up camps for Kurdish
refugees and other groups who
seemingly have no place to go. These
camps are being established amidst a
fervor to rid the country of all those
associated with the Iraqi Forces,
namely those soldiers still creating
problems.

On April 21, an outbreak of
violence by unknown armed men
wounded five refugees by firing into
a crowd awaiting food distribution.
This incident caused much fear in the
people, although the military has
stated that the Iraqis have basically
adhered to the message from the
American Military: “Do not interfere
with the efforts to aid the refugees.”
Chaotic events, such as the shooting,
are setting back the plans for aid, but
not to a great extent. Said Colonel
Jones while describing the campaign
to help the refugees rebuild, “If you

come back here a month from now
you’ ll see a city of tents. If youcome
back six weeks from now, you’ll see
a country.”

Policies affect
USSR and Japan

On April 19, Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu of Japan and Presi-
dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the
Soviet Union completed their nego-
tiations over land disputes remain-
ing from the end of World War II.
The talks began with many promis-
ing signs, but ended in only minor
changes. :

Although the main territorial
dispute still remains, both sides say
that they are relatively pleased with
the outcome; surprisingly, Kaifu
more than Gorbachev. There were
15 agreements signed when their
meetings were completed, and their
subjects ranged from trade fairs to
air rights. The one item not dis-
cussed during the talks was that in-
volving large-scale Japanese eco-
nomic cooperation.

The most positive outcome for
Japan was the concessions made
over the Kurile Islands.

residence halls, the fraternity houses
and recycling bins, but there is still
no information as to their where-
abouts.

Angry and appalled by the
theft, Drum addressed a larger con-
cern than just the theft of the paper—
censorship. Drum insisted that,
“People have to realize that these in-
dividuals responsible wanted to
censor the College press and the
voices of the members of the College
community.” Individuals who may
have any knowledge of the incident
are being urged to step forward and
cooperate. Until this time, the inves-
tigation will continue.

B.Y.O.B. Policy
Implemented

A unanimous decision has
been made by the presidents of the
fraternities to designate this weekend
as a trial B.Y.0.B. weekend. This
means that no alcohol will be served
by any fraternity house this weekend
with no exceptions.

Guests attending fraternities,
who are limited to one six-pack of 12
oz. cans of beer, will have to surren-
der all alcoholic beverages at the en-
trance of the function, at which time
they will receive a ticket in exchange
for each beer. Then, the guest may
enter the function and proceed to the
21 section to be proofed and
stamped. At this point, the guest can
exchange their tickets, one at a time,
for beer. The fratemity is not held
responsible for reimbursing guests
for any beer not consumed or for re-
turning specific brands to guests.
And, fraternitics and guests must still

abide by all applicable state, univer-
sity, and IFC alcohol and social
policies, as well as this new proce-
dure.

The purpose of this trial
weekend is to test these party proce-
dures and to give the campus a
chance to experience B.Y.O.B. be-
fore it becomes fully effective next
semester. Lambda Chi, Theta Chi,
Fiji, Chi Phi, Sigma Chi, and Kappa
Sigma will be following these pro-
cedures on Friday, while TKE, SAE,
SPE, DU, SAM, and KDR will use
Saturday as their trial date.

“Reverse discri-
mination" rises

Seven white college students’
“reverse discrimination” lawsuit
against the federal government mi-
nority scholarship policy might re-
flect a growing trend toward conser-
vation, some observers say.

If these white students suc-
ceed in their lawsuit, approximately
69% of campus scholarships for mi-
nority students would either be
scrapped or redistributed to students
on the basis of grades or family in-
come.

On March 22, the white stu-
dents sued the U.S. Dept. of Educa-
tion, calling some campuses’ efforts
to recruit minority students by of-
fering special scholarships discrimi-
natory. The students asked that all
federal funds from schools having
race-based scholarships be withheld.

The students were recruited
from Maealester and Mercy Col-
leges, the Universities Virginia,
Texas, Iowa and California at Los
Angeles. The suit is also being filed

NATIONAL

Killings rise in
NYC last year

The New York City statistics
for 1990 were recently released, and
their results are both incredible and
bewildering. The most frightening
statistic revealed a 17.8% increase in
the murder rate and a 7.4% increase
in robberies during the past year;
however, the same study has shown
that other crimes, namely rape, bur-
glaries, and aggravated assaults are
down from 1989.

Deputy Chief Michael A.
Markman, commander of the Office
of Management Analysis and Plan-
ning, determined that although the
statistics were overwhelming, the
bare facts show a steady rise in
murder and robbery across the
United States. In fact, says
Markman, New York City’s crime
rate is actually increasing more
slowly than that of the nation.

In an attempt to explain the
jump from 1,905 incidents of kill-
ings in 1989 to 2,256 murders last
year, city officials are citing drugs
and guns as the determining factors.
They claim that the increase in drug
dealings and the availability of hand
guns is proportional to the rise in

against Southern California by the
Washington Legal Foundation.

The concept that setting aside
benefits for minorities cheats whites
of those benefits is not a new notion
at all. It has long been a favorite
topic of conservative groups.

The conservative Washington

Legal Foundation first joined the
controversy last April when it filed a
complaint with the Education De-
partment about a race-based schol-
arship at Florida Avantic University.
The organization was still wailing
for a reply from the department in
December, when it was announced
that race-based scholarships violate
the 1964 Civil Rights Acts, which
bans awarding financial aid “based
solely on the race of the recipient.”
Schools continuing to offer these
types of scholarships were to lose
federal funding. However, two
weeks later, after extensive criti-
cism, the department said that col-
leges could give grants to people
based on the color of their skins if
the money came through private do-
nations. Then, on March 21, the new
Secretary of Education announced
that schools could return to the
methods which they practiced, be-
fore December.

This case could be the most
significant campus “reverse dis-
crimination” effort since the U.S.
Supreme Court’s 1978 “Bakke de-
cision,” in which a white student,
Allen Bakke, complained that the
University of California-Davis med
school rejected him in favor of sev-
eral minority students having lower
grades and board scores than him.

The Supreme Court agreed,
calling Davis’ affirmative action
program an unconstitutional punish-
ment of Bakke because of the color
of his skin. —The Clarion Call

random murders; however, there is
much controversial debate over
whether or not this statement is fac-
tual. Those arguing the city’s point
wonder why the rate of rape would
decrease, as many rapes are also
drug-related. The only answer which
may be considered valid is that
which declares people to be more
cautious than they were in 1989,
thereby decreasing the risks they
might previously have taken.

The new murder rate in New
York City is the highest thus far,
with the lowest occurring in the mid-
eighties with approximately 1,300
deaths. In order to change the statis-
tics for 1991, officials have estab-
lished more programs for youths, as
well as more uniformed police on the
streets.

Job hunting
tough for grads

Those seniors graduating this
year undoubtedly have many high
hopes for their futures, whether in
political science or the cover of
Fortune magazine. However, the
class of ’91 is quickly discovering
that, due to the recent recession, jobs
are becoming more and more diffi-
cult to find.

The job market has decreased
by 30% from last year, experts say,
meaning that there are now 1,5 mil-
lion less career opportunities avail-
able. This all-too-real figure is rap-
idly causing many seniors to lower
their job expectations, apply to
graduate schools as a means of de-
laying the inevitability of searching
for employment, or join such public
services as the Peace Corps or Teach
for America. Even with so many se-
niors dropping from the job
“scramble,” rejections are being re-
turned to graduating students with
increasing rapidity.

The main areas of the country
affected by this recession are the
Northeast and the New York region;
therefore, say counselors on cam-
Puses, flexibility is essential in the
hunt for potential employment. Se-
niors who have been searching for
jobs since the beginning of the year
are beginning to take whatever
arises, even if that means lowering

their expectations and working with
a small organization instead of a
large corporation. The graduating
class must also be prepared to move
around the country, depending on
job possibilities, even though that
may not be their first choice.

There is hope, however, say
many officials, who claim that the
recession is temporary, and that jobs
may begin to appear on the market
as soon as next year. Their advice is
to take time and accept lower-level
jobs even if they are not first-
choices.

Bush puSii2s
new school bill

President Bush, in a campaign
to improve schools nationwide,
spoke in favor of a new bill on April
18 before a crowd of educators,
business leaders, Governors and
members of Congress. This bill
would grant government money now
being spent only on public schools
to private and parochial institutions
as well. Those proposing the bill
believe that it will enable parents to
decide exactly which school their
children should attend, without the
price of the education playing a fac-
tor in their evaluation.

President Bush is also re-
questing $435 million from Con-

nd $150 million from private

esses to research new methods
of teaching and learning. This would
include the implementation of an
American Achievement Test which
would be structured to be used dur-
ing schools as a standard for knowl-
edge in basic subjects. This method
of testing is to be established by
1996.

Those opposing the bill feel
that giving money to parochial
schools violates the line between
church and state. They also believe
it will cause public schools to de-
cline in student enrollment, therefore
causing the quality of education to
decline as well,

Econ prof examines
risks of incinerator

By Travis Elliott
Staff Writer

On Tuesday, Nancy White, as-
sistant professor of economics, ad-
dressed the perceived risks of living
near a hazardous waste facility, and
the effect of these perceived risks on
local property values. The lecture,
entitled “The Economic Develop-
ment Aspects of Locally Undesir-
able Land Uses (LULU’s),” was
sponsored by the Bucknell Environ-
mental Action Committee which has
planned a series of lectures dealing
with U.S.P.C.1.’s proposal to build a
hazardous waste incinerator in
Gregg Township, in northern Union
County.

According to White, the per-
ception of risk causes people to al-
tempt to distance themselves from
possibly hazardous facilities, and
when people move out of an area,
property values decline. White said,
“Those who are too poor to move,
those attached to the community in
some other way, and those who may
not see the incinerator as a threat are
the ones eventually damaged by fall-
ing property values. These equity
problems should be of some concern
to us.”

White noted that Pennsylvania
has no legislation requiring reim-
bursement for the real economic
costs associated with risk percep-
tion.

She noted that the benefits of
a LULU such as a hazardous waste
incinerator are widespread, accruing
to all consumers of products which
produce hazardous wastes; however,
the cost associated with the disposal
of those wastes are borne by the lo-
cal community where the LULU is
SILCC
According to White, a decline
in property values could actually re-
duce the local tax base, and effec-
tively negate the cconomic boost
brought by more jobs. In addition,
White stated she was “suspicious of
job creation by

the claims of
US. C1?

White called for federal legis-
lation requiring reimbursement for
the costs involved with the perceived

The Bucknellian

lroquois leaders discuss Native
American philosophy of Earth

By Andrew Cohen
Staff Writer

Leon Shenandoah, Tadodaho,
or chief, of the Haudenosaunee
(Iroquois) Nation, and Denise
Waterman, their Traditional
Recordske¢per, addressed a capacity
crowd in the Langone Center Forum
on Saturday in conjunction with
Earth Weck festivities. Shenandoah
and Waterman’s lecture was spon-
sored by Chi Phi Fraternity as part
of the Biff Hoffman Memorial Lec-
tureship. They discussed how Native
American philosophy relates to
“mother earth.”

Waterman spoke first and de-
scribed the historical traditions of the
Iroquois.

“The Haudenosaunee are
called the people of the Longhouse.
Tonight we’re going to be thinking
about the Longhouse as a philosophy
that stretches over many groups of
people,” said Waterman.

In addition, Waterman ex-
plained that several themes pervade
Haudenosaunee tradition, one of
which is the tree of peace.
Waterman explained that she hoped
others could take the ideals of the
tree of peace and integrate them into
their own view of the environment,
“The tree of peace is something that
we hope stretches through our broad
longhouse in North America.”

Shenandoah explained that the
reason Iroquois place such a high
value on the environment is due to
the importance they place on the
natural order of things, “...our spiri-
tual way of life is in harmony with
nature, with all animals, because we
depend on one another.”

Waterman also commented
that it is a vision of the future and a
duty to one’s offspring which de-
mand that we treat mother earth with
respect. “The children of our nation

is what keeps us going. The
McDonald’s cup on the ground

won’t naturally dispose of itself, it is
left for someone else. Whatever we
leave we must Icave in great condi-
tion for our children. This is the goal
of the actions and the laws that we
carry out everyday.”

Waterman summarized the in-
ternational work that the
Haudonosauncee do to promote envi-
ronmental awareness. One of the
activities they are participating in is
an environmental symposium in
Brazil in 1992.

She encouraged the audicnce
to be politically active on behalf of
the environment, “The U.S. delega-
tion is one of the strongest at the
meeting. You should find out what
your own country is saying on be-
half of you.”

The Iroquois are also involved
in saving a forest in Canada. “There
is also Amazon North. The Crees
own a forest area that is the size of
France; it will be flooded by dams
set up by the Canadian government

Page 5

{unless something is done to stop
it.]”

Shenandoah asserted that the
reason the environment is in such
dire shape is that the rest of the world
is focusing on the wrong types of is-
sues, “It’s the money that’s going to
ruin this world, the money is behind
the pollution. Moncy is their power,
our powcr is spirituality.”

He also described the folly of
pollution since, according to
Shenandoah, “We all know how we
have pollution of the air, the water
and the land. We cannot survive
without the air, we cannot survive
without the walcr, we Cannot survive
without the land.”

Finally, Shenandoah encour-
aged action, but, he also noted that
only the world as a whole can act to
save the environment. “One person
cannot stop it, ten people cannot stop
it, 100 people cannot stop it.
Everybody’s got to do the same
thing.”

Cumberland ’93 represents Delta
Upsilon International at White House

By Darren Millman

Brian Cumberland ’93 was se-
lected by Delta Upsilon (DU) Frater-
nity International to represent the
organization’s nearly 3,000 under-
graduate members at an April 5
White House conference which fo-
cused upon greek philanthropy ef-
forts and the abuse of alcohol and
drugs.

DU Executive Director Steven
Gerber joined Cumberland in Wash-
ington D.C., along with representa-
tives from approximately 70 other
international/national college frater-
nities and sororities.

Several speakers, including
Bob Martinez, director of the office
of national drug control policy, and
U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Antonia
C. Novello, addressed. the greek rep-
resentatives. Cumberland com-
mented that Martinez provided him
with “an up-to-date understanding of

Martinez also spoke specifi-
cally about the March 23 University
of Virginia fraternity drug raids
which resulted in the arrests of 12
students. The three fraternities in-
volved, UVA’s chapters of DU, Phi
Epsilon and Tau Kappa Epsilon,
have been placed under federal con-
tro!
According to Cumberland,
Martinez explained that the success
of the federal investigation at UVA
did not indicate that a nationwide
fraternity inquiry would take place.
“He [Martinez] stated that the
federal government was not going to
be any more lenient towards frater-
nities, but that they were not out to
get people either,” noted
Cumberland.

Novello primarily discussed
her extensive attempts to combat the
issue of underage drinking in
schools. Novello has made efforts
to work with beer distributors in or-
der to deal with the problem at the

source.

In regard to the conference as
a whole, Cumberland remarked, “I
received a well-rounded intake of
practical information that I can pass
on to the chapter.” He praised

The musical comedy A //is-
tory of the American Film, by Chris-
topher Durang, opens tonight at 8
p.m. in the University Theatre in
Coleman Hall. Performances will
continue cach night through Mon-
day, with a special matinee show at
2 p.m. on Sunday.

The play presents a hilarious
parody of American film history,
from early silent movies to modern
classics. Durang follows five stock
film characters through over fifty
years of film, supported by an en-
semble of fourteen “contract play-
ers” who together play over one hun-
dred roles. Val Marsden *93 and
Andrew Garman '91 play the pri-
mary “onscreen” couple: Loretta, a
wide-eyed ingenue, and Jimmy, a
sentimental gangster. Peppy
Kokines ’91 plays Bette,a tough B-
girl who grapples with Loretta over
Jimmy. The relationships become
even more complicated, however,
with the arrival of the drawling
Hank, played by Marc Kenny ’91,
and wisccracking Eve, played by
Shelly Simonds ’91. The “contract
players” include Audrey Carmeli
*91, Jill Emery °92, Kristen Feeney
92, Geotrey Glen ’91, Rebecca
Goldstein ’93, Paul Heimer ’93,
Katrina Herb *93, George Hannah
°93, Erin Hunter ’92, Bryan Kenny

This production is directed by
Gary Grant. Grant, assistant profes-
sor of theatre, says, “This show has
given me the opportunity to imagine
myself as the director of some of the
greatest American films. I have been
able to become involved with the
dynamic images and emotions of
film history.” He adds that the re-
hearsal process has been especially
exciting for him because it has meant

“working with people of enormous
talent and creativity—in the cast, the
technical crew, and the design
team.”

This show has provided excit-
ing opportunitics in all areas of the-
atrical production, involving both
students and guest artists in the col-
laborative process. Scenic designer
Jason Aten ’91 explains, “As a stu-
dent, it is great to work with a team
of professionals. For me, this has
been the most educational aspect of
the student design curriculum.” Aten
has also enjoyed the challenge of
presenting the audience with “mean-
ingful symbols” which will evoke
memories of historical moments in
American film.

Costume Designer Wendy

Rolfe, who received her M.F.A.
from the Yale School of Drama, ad-
mitted that there are so many cos-
tumes in the musical that she was
“afraid to count” them all. However,
she enjoyed this enormous opportu-
nity: “With this show, I have been
able to create costumes from the tail
end of the Victorian era, all the way
through the 1960's.” Rolf was for-
merly a student of director Gary
Grant at the University of Puget
Sound, where she played Miss
Scoons in his production of Sam
Shepard’s Angel City. “I am very
excited to have the opportunity to
work again with my mentor,” she
remarked.

feature Sojka

By Julie L. Shurilla

The Bucknell University Or-
chestra, under the direction of
Christopher Para, assistant profes-
sor of music, will perform May 3
at8 p.m. in the Weis Center. Their
program will feature “Lincoln Por-
trait,” by Aaron Copland, with a
narration read by President Gary
Sojka.

“Lincoln Portrait” utilizes
quotations from various writings of
Lincoln’s, many of which were un-
known before the picce was writ-
ten. Para said that the picce is in-
teresting because it not only paints
a picture of Lincoln, but also de-
scribes our nation at the time of the
Civil War, “who it was and what it
stood for.”

The picce was commis-
sioned in 1942, during a time when
our country was involved in war,
and, with the recent Persian Gulf
crisis, Para said the picce is “very
timely now.”

Para actually decided to per-
form the picce last year because he
felt that it also “was appropriate for
this time at Bucknell. It portrays
the struggle which our country was
going through at the time of the
Civil War, and we are going
through a time of struggle here at
Bucknell, The faculty and admin-
istration have been faced with mo-
mentous decisions which have no
casy solutions.”
ara requested that President
Sojka narrate “Lincoln Portrait”
because he felt that the piece re-
flected “beliefs held by the Univer-
sity” and that the president “speaks
for all of us, the University com-
munity as a whole.”

President Sojka admires the

part he reads not only because of
its timelessness, but also because
of its “economy of language, which
is reminiscent of poctry,” poctry
being a personal interest of his.

Para noted how unusual it is
for a president to be as involved as
Sojka. “He is willing to enter into a
new experience and get involved
with a student ensemble,” said
Para. On his part, Sojka makes cv-
ery effort to attend all of the stu-
dent performances on campus, al-
though he admitted that it is diffi-
cult at times to squeeze in them all.

“Lincoln Portrait” opens
with melodies which, in the second
half, form the accompaniment for
quotations from Lincoln’s writing.
Although the quotations are spoken
and not sung, Sojka said it is “very
demanding” to perform because it
requires “timing and precision. I
have to start and end at the right
time.” Sojka had heard the piece
performed once before by the
Philadelphia Orchestra with Henry
Fonda as the narrator, a difficult
combination to emulate.

The orchestra will also be
performing a medicy of songs from
Leonard Bernstcin’s “West Side
Story.” Bernstcin was a good
friend of Copland’s, and both
passed away just last year. For this
reason, Para thought it would be
fitting to honor the two of them in
this concert. They will also be per-
forming works by Berlioz and
Bizct.

The orchestra and Sojka will
also perform “Lincoln Portrait”
this Saturday night at the Prism
Concert at 8:30 p.m. in the Weis
Center. This concert is unique in
that it features many performing
groups from the music department.

Weis Center welcomes Chipfest ’91

Bison Chips and guest a cappella groups come together for an evening of harmony

By Maria Glod
Staff Writer

“We're like The New Kids On
The Block,” says Bison Chip leader
Andrew Lunstad ’91. “Kind of like
the Jackson Five, but there are more
of us.” There may be some truth to
that statement, but most would cer-
tainly agree that the Bison Chips are
a fun, entertaining, and talented per-
forming group.

Fortunately for their fans, the
Bison Chips will be singing tonight
in the second annual Chipfest at 8
p.m. in the Weis Center. Chipfest,
held primarily to bring other college
a cappella groups to campus, gives
the members of the Bucknell com-
munity a chance to experience dif-
ferent sounds and styles. Tonight’s
concert will feature Cornell
University’s Touchtones and Bates
College’s Merrimanders.

In turn, t Chips do their

share of roadtripping. This semester
they have performed at Bryn-Mawr
College, Cornell University, and
Washington University in St. Louis,
and many local high schools. As
glorious as it may sound, however, a
little rain must fall even in the life of
a Bison Chip. Lunstad reported that
while at Milton Arca High School,
the group “got in trouble for running
in the halls.” But according to Rick
Cranford ’92, the trip was nota total
loss. “We were a big hit—we almost
had five prom dates.”

The Bison Chips also fre-

quently sing around campus, in-

cluding performances during Fresh-
man Orientation and Christmas
Dinner. Coming up on May 15, there
will be a Bison Coffeehouse concert
featuring all four campus a cappella
groups: the Harmonex, Some Sing-
ers, the Silhouettes, and the Bison
Chips.

For those who just cannot get
enough of the Chips’ melodious
strains, call 523-6627 and order a
Bison Chip tuck-in. If all else fails,
there is one more place on campus

Jazz and Rock Ensemble to

Professor’s journeys come
alive in photography exhibit

By Charlie Collier

For those who think of the li-
brary as a place to avoid unless ab-
solutely necessary Marianna
Archambault, professor of modern
languages, offers an entirely new
reason to visit with her compelling
photography exhibit “Textures and
Reflections.” The exhibit, made up
of 39 photographs from cities such
as Paris, Venice and New York, of-
fers you the chance to see the world
without ever having to leave the li-
brary or even open a book.

“Textures and Reflections”
is a fitting name for the exhibit as
almost every photo captures a pat-
tern or angle that makes one want
to examine it more closely.
Archambault explained that the
name for the exhibit came from
showing slides of her photographs
to friends, and through this, similar
words describing the photographs
were often used. For example, one
of Archambault’s friends com-
mented that “when I look at a pic-
ture of yours I feel like touching
it.” This is no doubt a common re-
action when viewing her photogra-
phy as she has timelessly captured
depth and textures that make one
want to feel as well as view her art.

Archambault is the chair of
the department of modern lan-
guages and secretary of the faculty.
Her education began in Prague,
Czechoslovakia and included time
in Brooklyn during grade school
and a year at a French high school
in Belgium. She completed her
studies at Penn State University,
receiving her bachelors and mas-
ters degree and Ph.D.

Remarkably, however,
Archambault has had no formal
training in photography. She does
not develop her own prints and
uses rather standard equipment.
“It’s simply a camera where I can
control the shutter speed and the
light exposure,” she commented.
Her eye truly guides her and rarely
does she crop or alter her photo-
graphs once they have been devel-
oped. “I do the framing as I take
the picture,” she explained. It is
this gift for “framing” that comes

through quite clearly in her work.
Every inch of her photographs help
to enhance their feeling, whether it
be a small dog on a rooftop or the
subtle patterns of a wall or sidewalk
in a background.

“T like very much the idea of
reaching out to others through my
pictures,” remarked Archambault
with pride. She has certainly com-
piled an exhibit that achieves this
goal. Last weekend she entered sev-
eral of her photographs in the Lewis-

burg Festival of the Arts. Her work
received one first place and three
seconds. These photographs are on
display at the Lewisburg Photo
Shop on Market Street.

“Textures and Reflections”
is currently on display on the sec-
ond level of the library, adjacent to
the office and continues into the
periodicals section. The exhibit
will be displayed throughout the
summer.

jam in the quad tomorrow

By Jon Elliot
Staff Writer

Are you looking for something
to do with your parents after dinner
Saturday night and before you take
them out to chug beers or do the cir-
cuit? Well then, look no further than
the academic quad for what many
hope will prove to be a most enter-
taining time for young and old alike.
The student run and student directed
talents of the Bucknell Jazz and
Rock Ensemble, BJRE, will be per-
forming, free of charge and weather
permitting, at 10 pm in the academic
quad.

Under the direction of student
director Dan Janueski ’91, the En-
semble will be performing such Jazz

classics as “April in Paris” and “'A
Train” as well as more recent hits
such as Pat Metheny’s “First Circle”
and the theme song from “Late Night
with David Letterman” as composed
by Paul Shaefer.

BJRE recently returned from
Edison, New Jersey, where they
competed in an exhibition and were
critiqued by the likes of Jazz great
Justin DiCiocio. This year’s crop of
musicians has proven themselves to
be one of the best ensembles Buck-
nell has to offer. This is BJRE’s 17th
year of existence at Bucknell.

“We are mostly made up of
non-music majors, you know guys
and girls who just dig playing mu-
sic,” says BJRE trumpeter Joe
Zavory °93, “but it’s pretty serious.”

Made up of 17 full-time members
who have been selected through a
rather informal auditioning process,
the ensemble practices a minimum
of three hours per week as a group.
The group is monetarily supported
by the University, which according
to Zavory, “keeps us solvent.”

BJRE will also be performing
at the Weis Center on May 15, as the
headlining act. With the enthusiasm
of the ensemble, this free perfor-
mance will hopefully allow BJRE to
prove themselves as an alternative
form of quality entertainment within
the Bucknell bubble. BJRE is ex-
cited to perform for parents and stu-
dents alike, and according to Zavory,
“we want everybody to come out and
see us strut our stuff and ‘display our
wares’.

Jazz & Blues Express

By Vic Tchiprout

The Bison Jazz and Blues
Express continued to reward its
audiences lest Sunday with the
Sallins/Marshall Project. For the
first time, the concert series was
able to attract a good-sized crowd
with this htaavy R&B/funk-influ-
enced fusion group.

Led by Joe Sallins, the
Sallins/Marshall Project has been
playing fo: four years throughout
the Northeast at various clubs and
universities. All compositions are
written and arranged by bassist
Sallins, with occasional help from
his newest keyboardist, Ed Smith.
With the input and inspiration of

added to the flavor by continuously
improvising on the drum sct. Us-
ing a simple five drum sct, he man-
aged to create the sound and com-
plexity of an elaborate set-up.

The excitement of the
Sallins/Marshall Project was evi-
dent on the faster tunes, where the
skill and personality of each musi-
cian exploded into endless solos
appearing from nowhere and then
easily fading with the utmost el-
egance. The concert had an
unhurried, knowing feel of a band
that has been through endless jam
sessions and has focused on mak-
ing music not for the pop charts,
but for the few that appreciate such
jazzy spontancity. The group

his close friend anddrummer, Rick
Marshall, the band has surpassed
the amateur Ievel and, despite their
humble beginning, has become one
of the leading underground fusion
jazz groups around.

The highlight of the perfor-
mance was the sleck interplay of
electric bass guitarist Tyrone
Blanton along with Sallins’ piccolo
electric bass guitar. It is the syn-
ergy created by these two bassists
that has established the group’s
style in the realm of fusion jazz.

ended with Blue Bossa, a percus-
sion spectacle in which the two
bassists traveled around the Bison,
drumming on all possible surfaces
and then inviting two members
from the audience to try their hands
on a set of congas. The Sallins/
Marshall Project is certainly rede-
fining the role and future of fusion
jazz with their funky bass lines and
innovative techniques.

Twenty-five years of Bucknell grad’s art will go on exhibit tomorrow

By Karen M. Ebersold

The Bucknell community will
have the distinct pleasure of viewing
“the most comprehensive exhibition
in terms of its breadth and range” of
David Armstrong’s work over the
past twenty five years. Entitled
“David Armstrong: Twenty-Five
Years of Painting,” the exhibit will
include acrylic paintings, egg tem-
pera paintings, water color paintings,
oil paintings, pencil drawings, stud-
ies for larger works, and the larger
works themselves.

The Center Gallery in the
Langone Center will host the exhibit
which will run from April 27
through June 9. The show will in-
deed prove the potential for artistic
growth at this University as
Armstrong is a 1969 graduate of
Bucknell, achieving national success
with many acclaimed exhibitions
both on the East and West coasts.
Armand Hammer, the late philan-
thropist, gave an Armstrong work to
President George Bush. He has had
eight one-man shows in New York
City, and his work is a part of many
private and museum collections,
some parts of which, not seen by
even Armstrong himself in the past
25 years, have been specially bor-
rowed for this exhibit.

The Academy of Artistic
Achievement, established in 1990 by
Bucknell’s Association for the Arts
for the recognition of distinguished
Bucknell alumni in the Arts, chose
Armstrong as their first member in
the Visual Arts field. Armstrong sees
this as a “wonderful opportunity”
and a “great honor” and feels that
“Bucknell has the facilities and the

location to be a major contributor to
the field of the arts,” and it is essen-
tial that the importance of the arts
and its students are recognized.

His works cover a broad range
of traditional American Realism
subjects from portraits of his neigh-
bors and family to landscapes of
Pennsylvania and the coast of
Maine. “The work is reflective of my
direction in painting in terms of sub-
stance, subject, and medium over the
last twenty-five years,” says
Armstrong, whose dedication and
passion for painting is most evident

in this exhibit.

Armstrong’s beautiful and re-
alistic landscape paintings inevitably
emphasize the value and beauty of
American land which is quickly dis-
appearing. Armstrong does not want
to dictate one specific environmen-
tal message with his paintings but
instead wants the viewer to decide
and “take away from the exhibit
what he wants.” Armstrong did,
however, speak of the “frightening
alienation” that we have from the
land in our modern world and said,
“if people leave the exhibit with

where a hesitant cight year old boy,
John, and his tough, yet loving,
nanny have decided to take a relax-
ing vacation. The boy soon discov-
ers, however, that hordes of witches
from all over the world have met at
the hotel for a secret convention. The
witches are secretly plotting to turn
all children into MICE. Something
must be done!

In a delightfully spooky mo-
ment, John spies on the huge clan of
witches from behind a table as they
remove their “human” disguises and
turn into comically disgusting mon-
sters. The film is filled with enough
close-calls and near misses to keep

any child’s attention for the entire
film. There are also some subtle
moral messages, characteristic of
Roald Dahl, addressing such unat-
tractive qualities as selfishness and
grecdiness. The film is brimming
with acerbic ironies and poctic jus-
tice

The movie also offers some
pleasant surprises for parents or
older brothers and sisters. Anjelica
Houston gives a superbly evil per-
formance as the sadistic head witch.

German accent, “Der isss a CHILD

Armstrong will be present for

in the gallery, at which time
Armstrong will speak about his work
and answer any questions that view-
ers might have. The Center Gallery,
on the third floor of the Langone

raphy arc brilliant. At risk of giving
away onc of the many twists of the
film, Henson’s manipulation of real-
istic looking small animals is not
“cheesy.”

The Witches is rated PG. At
times during the film, I wondered if
this was an appropriate rating. Judg-
ing from the number of seven and
eight year old hands clutching their
armrests in terror, one might want to
explain to younger children ahead of
time that the somewhat gruesome
make-up sported by the witches is
just a special effect. One also might
reinforce that witches do not really
exist in real life. Or do they?

Delta Upsilon and The Villages
"Making a difference in the lives of children"

All of the children that call The Villages home have been abused either emotionally, physically or
sexually. The typical resident has been in five different living situations prior to coming to The
Villages. The average age of the residents is 14.

No child who comes to a Villages home need ever leave it until he or she reaches adulthood or
until it is judged to be in that child's best interest. It is this idea of permanence that makes The

Villages unique.

Approaching greatness

Bucknell surmounts problems and looks toward future...

Universities across the nation are facing an ever more competitive future as the applicant pool starts
to shrink and the cost of a private education continues to grow, but the future for Bucknell is amazingly
bright. Under the leadership of President Gary Sojka, the University has expanded and improved over the

past several years.

Perhaps the most significant accomplishment has been the successful conclusion of the Campaign

for Bucknell which added $90.9 million to the University’s endowment.

Construction on campus has also been a sign of the University’s strong commitment to providing
adequate facilities. Phase two of the new Science Complex, the $12 million Biology building, will pro-
vide improved facilities for the Biology department which is currently constrained in the outdated Taylor
Hall. The Olin Science renovation and the new Chemistry Building are also symbolic of Bucknell’s new
commitment to the natural sciences. The University is becoming a liberal arts institution with a distinc-

tively scientific flair.

Similarly, the new Bison has helped to provide increased social space for students, and its many

entertainment functions have been a welcome alternative source of social activity.

The construction of the new Bison may also have alleviated much of the low morale that existed
among students last semester. The University Counsel's overly cautious interpretation of Act 31, along
with overzealous alcohol policy enforcement on behalf of Security, spurred a near riot last Halloween.
Since then, the new Director of Security and Safety, Vince DeCerchio, has formulated a tough but fair
enforcement policy and made the department more open to students. Morale no longer seems to be as

problematic

Other staff changes also promise to bring fresh blood and new and innovative ideas to campus.
Currently, many administrative positions are being consolidated. For example, one of the special assis-
tants to the president will now be assuming the dutics of two other administrators.

While consolidation and efficiency are important, care must be taken not to overload administra-
tors. Such overloading might encourage capable employces to leave the University.

The underlying problem with the cut in administration is the trustees’ recent decision to minimize
the increase in the comprehensive fee. A slim increase of only 4.5% has left the University scrambling for
funds. While this may be a windfall for current students, the long-term ramifications are troubling.

At the same time however, the greek system appears to be thriving once again. The debate over the
fate of the system has now come to pass, despite some discontent with sophomore rush. Indeed, the Phi
Kappa Psi house, which has been a scar on the face of Bucknell for nearly three years is promising to
reopen next semester.

The problem of crime, particularly vandalism, remains, however. In December, USA Today reported
that Bucknell had the highest per capita crime rate of any university in the Commonwealth. Much of this
high rate was attributed to Security’s filling of reports on even minor incidents, but some of the blame
must lic with an irresponsible student body. It is time for the University to take Steps to reverse the trend
toward higher crime—releasing the names of students convicted of criminal activities to campus media
organizations would provide a healthy deterrent. It is time that our tuition dollars were put toward educa-

tion rather than replacing vandalized property.

Bucknell also has made minor steps toward diversification. The STEP program has brought a num-

ber of non-traditional students to campus forthe Community College of Philadelphia.

Bucknell has successfully surmounted a substandard endowment, controversy over the greek sys-
tem, and low student moral. Some problems still persist such as crime, vandalism, and budgetary con-

straints, but Bucknell now stands ready to become a unique and even more exceptional institution.

LEWERS TO THE EDITOR

Parent angered about
criticism of S.T.O.P.

To the Editor:

My daughter recently sent me
a copy of the February 15th issue
of the Bucknellian which contained
a letter from Diane E. Oltorik to
you about dramatic displays against
the recent Gulf War. It is not my
intention to initiate a “republic of
letters” among parents, but I found
the letter subversively, almost vis-
cerally, offensive to standard
American val-
ues of freedom
and intelli-
gence. I hope
young students
have not been
swayed by ils
bogus air of
rationality or by
its character
assassination of
the young
people in
STOP:

Because the letter was written
with uncanny rhetorical talent, it
could pass for an authentic argu-
ment. The grammar rhythm, dic-
tion, the air of common sense and
decency smuggled into the reader’s
brain by its savvy brush strokes,
reminded me of Ronald Reagan’s
ability to convince us he could
read. Upon close analysis, the letter
gave off a sinister feeling, as sense
of ingratiating manipulation, and
after realizing it was authentic, that
sentient people actually think this
way, I felt very much as if I were
launching at the Port Authority Bus
Terminal.

Ms. Oltorik offers up her
daughter as a precious commodity
tainted by free expression from
other students. I worry if Janelle
will be alright, what with her level

Fraternity disturbed by
lack of faculty support

To the Editor:

On April 16, 1991, Tim
Hartman, of U.S.P.C.L., and
Clyde Peeling , of Organizations
United for the Environment,
engaged in a very informative
discussion in which each gentle-
man presented information re-
garding the hazardous waste
management facility that
U.S.P.C.I. is proposing to build
near Lewisburg. About 45
people, all students and towns-
people, attended the discussion,
which was sponsored by the
Social Awareness Committee of
the Kappa Delta Rho Fratemity.

In its most recent meeting
the Bucknell faculty voted unani-
mously to take a position against
the construction of the waste
incinerator. We, the Social
Awareness Commitice of Kappa
Delta Rho, find it somewhat odd
that, after having adopted such a

Position, not one member of the
faculty chose to attend the discus-
sion. Perhaps none of them had
the free time to attend. Perhaps
they all thought that they knew
all there was to know regarding
the issue and were unwilling to
hear any more. Perhaps if the
discussion had been sponsored by
a group other than a fraternity, in
other words, by a group against
which the faculty bore no preju-
dice, some of the faculty would
have attended. As it was, no
faculty members were present at
a function from which all of
those who attended profited as
they were exposed to conflicting
perspectives on a controversial
and important issue.

Admissions thanks
students for hospitality

To the Editor:

I want to take this opportu-
nity to thank the Bucknell students
who assisted with the Admissions
Open House, especially our Admis-
sions tour guides and interns, mem-
bers of Alpha Phi Omega, orienta-
tion assistants, junior fellows, the
four freshmen hall groups that
opened up their halls to visitors.
Prospective students and families
time and again mentioned that
contact with Bucknell students was

a very meaningful part of the day.
The weather on the day of the
Open House was cold and drizzly,
but the spirit and enthusiasm of the
Bucknell students was warm and
sunny. A very special thanks to all!

Senior questions
organizations’ motives

To the Editor:

Hello, I am a male, white,
Greek, heterosexual Bucknell stu-
dent. Have I offended you?
Chances are, I probably have,
which is not in the least bit surpris-
ing. These days, a person’s mere
existence can spark controversy
and anger on this campus. We have
a number of diverse groups here at
beautiful Bucknell, each with its
own specific
agenda and/or
mission. Nor-
mally, this is fine.
However, the
problem arises
when one group
claims superiority
(in either purpose
or idea) over that
of another. This
group, feeling that
itis more “cor-
rect” that the other, will sing its
own praises while slandering those
who might have a different view-
point. The problem greatly intensi-
fies when more than one group
takes this self-righteous stance. The
result: confusion, anger, and hypoc-
risy. This situation has recently
arisen on our campus. The contro-
versy has centered around Jeans
Day, and the emergence of a new

group on campus. The players are
well known to everyone: F.L.A.G.,
P.O.W.E.R., and the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee for Heterosexual Awareness.
The result has been quite a nauseat-
ing scenario.

Let us begin with the newest
member of the fracas, the Ad Hoc
Committee for Heterosexual
Awareness. Evan Maloney, the
organizer of this committee, says
that the purpose of Heterosexual

“These days, a
person’s mere
existence can
spark contro-
versy and anger
on this campus.”

Pride Day is twofold: First, to be an
expression of pro-hetercsexual (not
necessarily anti-homoseyual) feel-
ings, and second, to “expose how
the left-wing groups work on cam-
pus.” My question to Mr. Maloney
and his cohons is this: “Is your
Purpose genuine?”

There has been some concern
about the Ad Hoc Committee being
linked to a group calling them-
selves F.A.G. (Friends of Aati-
Gays). Mr.
Maloney claims
that there is no
connection be-
tween the two,
that FAG is
merely a fictitious
tag that some
individual (or
individuals) wrote
on his group’s
advertisements,
However, others
Claim that the two groups are, in
fact, associated with one another, if
Not the same group all together. If
the latter is the case, Mr. Maloney,
then you are an incredibly ignorant
individual. To begin with, choosing
a name like F.A.G. is neither cute
Nor creative. It reveals you and
your group to be nothing more than
ill-informed homophobes who
obviously have a lot of free time on
your hands. Not only that, but your
actions only make the situation
worse. If you disagree with Jeans
Day and what it stands for, then
simply do not wear jeans on April
17, but don’t make a mockery of
what some feel to be a serious
expression of their feelings. If,

Heterosexuals’ bias causes campus tensions

By Margaret E. Cronin
University Writing Center, Tutor

HOMOPHOBIA— The irra-
tional fear or hatred of gay men, les-
bians, and bisexuals.

HETEROSEXISM— is the
view that heterosexuality is the
‘norm’ for all social/sexual relation-
ships and as such the heterosexist

imposes the model on all individuals
through homophobia. S/he supports
and /or advocates this continued in-
stitutionalization of heterosexuality
in all aspects of society, including
the denial of homosexual rights as a
political concern. (Cherrie Moraga,
1983.) Basically stated, hetcrosexu-
als have privileges and power over
gays and lesbians that are granted to
them solely on the basis of their

sexual orientation,

In all the years that I’ve been
working to raise awareness about
homophobia at Bucknell, I’ve never
seen a front page feature article on
Jeans Day, until this year, when
Jeans Day has also been proclaimed
“Heterosexual Pride Day”. Why is it
that The Bucknellian rushes to cover
a story about people tearing down

speak about the legal and moral is-

America, all 1 could do was re-

movie, and for a long time after-
ward, I had nightmares. The
dreams were so real that I could
almost smell the gas and feel the
heat of the crematoria; my stom-

rotting bodies lying in open
graves. In my dream, I could hear
the words from the movie, “Lest

Skena’s
Prescription

By David Skena

Why do prices seem so high in
the Bison? I’m not the only one who
has asked that question and I think
the answer would benefit everyone
who usually eats there. I don’t want
this column to be an attack on dining
services. They do a fine job of feed-
ing everyone who is hungry and
compared to other schools I’ve been
to, the food is pretty good. My con-
cern is the cost attached to some
items in the Bison and the seemingly
discretionary price hikes of popular
foods.

Presumably, those in charge of
pricing the items in the Bison have
sound methods for doing so. I guess
that there might be a standard mark-
up percentage. Additionally, prices
are probably raised solely in re-
sponse to changes in wholesale
costs. After all, Dining Services is
here primarily to serve the Bucknell
community , not to profit like a nor-

about the tens of thousands of
people, whose cultures warned them
not to forget.

Throughout history, one group
has exploited, killed or subjugated
another group because of color, be-
lief, gender or nationality. Not only
the Jews have been the victims.
Blacks were kidnapped and enslaved
by Europeans and Amcricans, The
Native Americans were systemati-
cally forced from their lands, killed
and finally relocated to “reserva-
tions.” The same cruelty has been
visited upon the Incas, the Mayans
and the Aztecs at the hands of the
Spanish. And let us not forget the
American Japanese during World
War Il.

I wonder how many children
are truly taught of the Sand Creek
Massacre; slave boats, chains and
beatings; the stinking conditions of

mal business. Since the New Bison
has opened, I’ve been keeping track
of some of the price changes and I’m
perplexed. A pound of salad used to
cost $1.90, now the price is $2.40 (
A chicken breast was
1.95, now it’s $2.75 (Up 41%). The
soft pretzel, formerly an affordable
little snack, was forty cents, now it
brings in ninety-five cents (Up
137%). Other prices have also in-
creased but I think these examples
are enough to allow me to ask why
this has happened. I didn’t know
that produce prices had risen so
much or that a soft pretzel cartel just
flexed its muscle. Are we ina highly
inflationary period? I’m being sar-
castic but one can surely see how the
average consumer could be con-
fused, especially when a pound of
salad is still $1.99 at Weis Market.
It is because I have confidence
that all these pricing decisions were
made fairly that I ask Dining Ser-
vices to inform students, faculty,
support staff and administrators of
price changes by noting price in-
creases with a simple asterisk on the
chalkboard. It would also be nice if
a curious individual could know why
the change occurred. I think every-
one in the Bucknell community is
intelligent enough to understand that

How many have nightmares as the

persists.

If I could change any one

prejudice so that no adult or his-

if pricing changes were made to sim-

son to be revenue producers (That’s
half the reason they got remodeled)
but to what extent should hungry stu-

be made that having the Bison over-

guess that’s logical but I would still
like to know where the highest mark-

are better off financially could eat

Struggling students, an honorable
action indeed. One could also say
that the Bison should be run like any

never been news when, for years
now, signs simply advertising edu-
cational programs about
homophobia, or fliers announcing

consistently been torn down or de-

or misinformed the message may be.
I certainly have felt like ripping
these signs down, but choose not to.
I choose not to because, in my past

board for more than a day or so.

I'd like to address some prob-
lems I have with Evan Maloney’s
“Ad Hoc Committee on Hetero-
sexual Awareness”, and his ad cam-
paign for “Heterosexual Pride Day”
on Jeans Day. But before I get into
that, I’d like to talk about the signs
themselves. I realize it may be hard
for some people to understand why
other people get so freaked out by a
few signs proclaiming heterosexual
pride and awareness. Some people
might think, “What’s the big deal?”
Some others might think, “Well, I’m
for heterosexual and homosexual
rights, so what’s wrong with signs
calling for heterosexual pride?” But
the Heterosexual Pride Day signs are
offensive and even scary to a lot of
gay men, lesbians, bisexuals for a
couple of reasons. First of all, the
ones that said, “sponsored by
F.A.G., (Friends of Anti-Gays)”, are
obviously problematic. It’s scary to
see sign exhibiting hostility towards
part of your personhood, esp. when
you live in a _heterosexist/
homophobic culture in which your
physical/emotional safety as well as
your employment security, housing
rights, and child custody are at risk.
And second, the signs that did not
use the “F.A.G.” acronym, but
which did advocate heterosexual
pride or heterosexual awareness on
Jeans Day, are disturbing on a more
complex level. The “F.A.G.” signs
are blatantly homophobic: they are
anti-, or against, a whole section of
the population, and they make usc of
a derogatory term used to oppress
gay men, I think it’s pretty casy to

sce the problem with these fliers.
But the signs which simply
call for heterosexual pride or aware-
ness on a day designated to support
civil rights of gay men, lesbians, and
bisexual, are of a different, though
connected, order. Theses signs are
examples of heterosexism. As a
couple of people pointed out in let-
ters to the Bucknellian, every day is
heterosexual pride day— our culture
revolves around heterosexuality as if
heterosexuality were the only legiti-
mate reality despite the fact that at
least 2,469,290 Americans do not
share that reality. Despite how many
gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals
there are in this country, heterosexu-
ality is still privileged as the norm.
Sometimes, if you are a part of
a privileged group in a culture, you
get so used to your privilege that it
becomes invisible to you. You think
everyone has the same opportunities,
or the same social/cultural support,
that you do. I think this may be the
case with the “Ad Hoc Committee
for Heterosexual Awareness”. Het-
erosexual orientation is already
completely protected and sanc-
tioned, not just through our cultural
values, but through our society’s le-
gal system. If you’re heterosexual,
you don’t have to fight a court battle
to take your boyfriend or girlfriend
to your prom. If you’re heterosexual,
your intimate relationships can be
formally recognized through mar-
riage. If you’re heterosexual, you
don’t have to worry about losing
your job or your kids because of your

Freshman defends
A.H.C.H.A.’s actions

To the Editor:

“Jeans Day,” as this past 17
April was dubbed by members of
F.L.A.G. was resounding victory
for any student who wishes to
express his or her opinion. We
exposed the foes of free speech:
ironically, they were the same
people who last semester shouted
the loudest for free speech.
P.O.W.E.R., which had fought
hard for “chalk talk” as a vehicle
for free specch, sought to sup-
press us from using the same
medium. When we used the me-
dium they thought were “theirs,”
our messages were defaced. Epi-
thets such as “homophobic” were
hurled against us. Yct, we never
mentioned homosexuality in any
of our flyers or chalk talks. We
never took a stand for or against
homosexuality, The same group
wrote “heterosexual” on various
sidewalks with slash marks
through it. Would this be consid-
ered “heterophobia?” Would their
attempt at silencing us be consid-
ered “freespeechophobia?”

In the article, P.O.W.E.R.
said they were responding to our
“hate.” What hate? In saying that
we support heterosexuality, are
we saying we hate anyone? Are
the annual gay pride parades in
New York City thought of as acts
of hate against heterosexuals?

history. You see the dead don’t
protest, and my intuition is they
would if they could. But even then
too many people give “rational”
arguments against them.

When I read Janelle was sent
to Bucknell because it is a place
with a “history of conservative
values;” and when I heard the
undertone of a veiled consumer
threat, apparently spawned by a
violation of Ms. Oltorik’s buying
ethic; I wavered between lassitude
and hilarity. It was quite unreal.
Bucknell
certainly isn’t
Miss Buffy’s
finishing
school, even
if one holds
conservative
values, and I
suggest the
parent might
be disabused
by reading
any simple-
minded para-
graph on the
notion of a
university. It seems rather to be a
case of consumer naivete, and her
pitch calls to my mind Surreal
Estate agents who hawk quictude
in the suburbs of America, that
generalized place where the waters
of social order hold no Ripple.

Let me substitute the follow-
ing for Ms. Oltorik’s comments. I
commend the school for its terrific
faculty; my daughter has taken
many deeply stimulating courses.
But if Ms. Oltorik reflects Buck-
nell in any persistent way, I have
been the naive consumer. I am
disturbed by the absence of con-
tinuous, lively dissent on campus.
It may be that Bucknell does not
allow its ambience to be defined
ENOUGH by serious, spirited,
broadly styled expression. It might
be construed, as might Ms.
Oltorik’s letter, to be a lethal fail-
ure of imagination.

It has struck me during my
many visits to campus also that
there is a cathode ray metaphysic

“the bookstore
has deteriorated in
seriousness over
the past three
years—Bill Cosby is
the most visible
philosopher on
display.”

P.O.W.E.R. was also
quoted as saying what they had
done to our notices was “dia-
logue.” These people would prob-
ably call the Nazi book burnings
“literature appreciation.”
Hussein’s torching of hundreds of
oil fields would be “atmospheric
modification.” Nice euphemisms,
but Bucknellians are smarter than
that.

Lastly, a “trained peer edu-
cator for homophobia” says that
A.H.C.H.A. “feels threatened by
Jeans Day.” We were never
threatened enough to tear down
their signs or attempt to suppress
their speech. We may disagree,
but I will fight for their right to
speak as vehemently as I will for
my own. They are the ones who
appear threatened by our speech.

1 want to thank you for
presenting the article in a fair and
objective manner, We felt the
suggestion that students wear
jeans and a tic was a good one.
People can support right for ho-
moscexuals and still show support
for heterosexuals. The “contro-
versy” was simply a matter of
rights, of which speech is one,
and A.H.C.H.A. supports the
right guaranteed to all humans,
not just heterosexuals.

fabricating the tone of the place.
Courses cannot be the sole source
of education. The environment has
to foster a supportive depth also.
It’s not possible to survive with
only a sit-com gesture, good will,
and silly relativism. The university
digs deeper, or it should.

But, for example, the book-
store has deteriorated in seriousness
over the past three years —Bill
Cosby is the most visible philoso-
pher on display. The gene pool is
also in danger from all that fluores-
cence. The Bison sclls cigarettes
even though everyone is taught in
school that smok-
ing kills. The
“new” Bison has
nanosecond
“PINGS” and a
TV screen bigger
than the Moon’s
schlong. I thought
the entire place
would read TILT
when I walked in
at the ribbon cut-
ling ceremony.
How can there be
rational discussion
there? On what
would Janelle level her gaze?

Actually I did turn off the
monster TV at the Grand Opening,
but a supervisor told me it should
remain on. I pointed out nobody
was watching it. When she said
they won’t watch if it’s off, I began
to record my own pulse. I just sat
like a catatonic robot on a day pass,
groping to detect a flaw in her
supervisory logic. But it was a real
homey environment for fecling
stunned.

These conditions effect a
scrious dilution of the intellectual
climate, How else could you possi-
bly account for the absence of
massive outrage to the letter I’ve
criticized? Shit, Gary, it castigated
you for not squashing free expres-
sion because Janelle might get a
tummy ache. Why aren’t YOU
outraged?

plaud you (as well as apologize for
the above). Showing genuine sup-
port for something you truly be-
lieve in is admirable. Just as the
supporter of homosexuality has the
right to wear jeans on Wednesday,
so does the supporter of a hetero-
sexual life-style by wearing a coat
and tie.

I hope you are sincere, Mr.
Maloney, because it would be a
shame if you were not.

Next, in this corner, we have
F.L.A.G. and their supporters. The
emergence of the Ad Hoc Commit-
tee for Heterosexual Awareness has
sent these people into a panic-
stricken frenzy. Zoe Ingram is
“scared.” Mary Swart and Peter

world trembles as another pro-
heterosexual group comes into
existence. I can hear it now: “To.

are coming! The heterosexuals are
coming! WE’RE ALL GOING TO
DIE!!”

I think a new word should be
added to the dictionary:
“Heterophobia.” What the hell are
you so afraid of, and why are you
so opposed to a group of people
who wish to celebrate their hetero-
sexuality? Ms. Swart and Mr.

To the Editor:

Last Friday, Dave
Vosseller wrote to the Bucknell-
ian to express his discomfort
with being judged for wearing
Or not wearing jeans on Jeans
Day. I agree with Dave — judg-
ing people for their attire on that
day is a seductively easy trap to
fall into. And, like Dave, I too
have caught myself making
those judgements. Because I
think this kind of “keeping
score” is usually uninformed
and almost always unfair, I try
to assume that everyone does
what he or she needs to on that
day. I’ve talked to Christian
friends whose struggles are
similar to Dave’s. And I’ve
known gay men and lesbians
who've not worn jeans on Jeans
Day because it’s just too scary;
it feels too visible for them to do
so. So I appreciate the spirit in
which Dave’s letter is written.

It is difficult, then to read
on and find Dave making his
own judgments on “homosexual
acts”, as he terms them. Part of
Dave’s letter goes like this: “All
humans have orientations, that ,
if acted upon and carried out are
wrong; to lie, to steal, to harm
another person, and the homo-
sexual act is not worse than any
of these acts, it is the same.”

is yes, just as every day is homo-
sexual pride day for homosexuals,
African American pride day for
African Americans, and so on. If
you are proud of yourself, your
culture, your history, and your life-
style, then every day should be a
day of pride for yourself. Gee, are
Ms. Swart and Mr. Hormand im-
plying that only certain individuals
should show pride in themselves?
Golly, that sounds a bit self-righ-
teous, doesn’t it? The two then ask
why these individuals “need to
publicize their heterosexual pride?”
Good Lord, if I went up to a gay
male and asked him why he doesn’t
stay in the closet, I'd be crucified
within a matter of minutes. Are
they trying to say that only certain
people should exercise their free-
dom of speech or freedom of ex-
pression? My my, how hypocriti-
cal.

Let’s say, for the sake of
argument, that Mr. Maloney and
his companions are not sincere.
What does it matter? One group of
individuals can in no way threaten
you, destroy your pride in yourself,
or deter you from your goals. Wear
you jeans, enjoy your life, and take
care of yourself and those you care
about. Heterosexual Bucknellians
are not secretly planning the eradi-
cation of the homosexual commu-
nity. The whole world is not out to
get you.

Finally, we come to
P.O.W.E.R. Boy, here’s a coura-

April 26, 1991

geous lot! If Mr. Maloney achieved
anything with his Heterosexual
Pride Day campaign, he certainly
exposed this group for what they
are. In order to publicize their
views, the Ad Hoc Committce
utilized fliers and “chalk talk.”
However, their ideas and opinions
clashed with those of P.O.W.E.R..
So, how did they respond? Why,
they responded in the most mature
and sensible way they knew how:
they tore down the fliers and
scribbled over the chalk messages.
Is this the way to defend your posi-
tion? What is even morc hilarious
is that an anonymous (shocker)
member of P.O.W.E.R. actually
called this an “effective dialogue.”
If mature responses had been writ-
ten either above, below, or beside
the group’s messages, then it would
have been a dialogue. Scribblings
and cross-outs, I’m sorry to say, are
not. You say that you are for equal-
ity, and that you want to be heard.
Does this mean at the expense of
others?

P.O.W.E.R. wishes us to
believe that they are serious, pow-
erful organization, dedicated to
their case. Let me ask you a ques-
tion then: Why is it that you choose
to remain anonymous? Is it that you
are afraid of persecution? If that is
your excuse, then please look upon
Mr. Ingram to reveal your weak-
ness. I personally do not condone
homosexuality, but one has to re-
spect Mr. Ingram for standing up

and fighting for what he believes
in. He has risked a great deal by
revealing his true identity to the
world. However, he did so because
he believed in himself and in his
words. So, P.O.W.E.R., your cow-
ardice leads me to two conclusions.
Either you aren’t for real, and your
entire existence here on campus has
been one big joke, or you are em-
barrassed at yourselves. Politically
and socially “correct” martyrs are a
dime a dozen these days. If you
have somcthing important to say to
the world, then say it, but not while
hiding behind a piece of chalk.

So what has been the result of
all of this? Hetcrosexuals have
come out of their closets, homo-
sexuals and bisexuals are running
for cover, feminists are buying up
all the chalk they can get their
hands on, and the average Buck-
nellian just can’t find a thing to
wear. What do we do? On a serious
note, just be yourself. Don’t link
yourself to one particular group or
another. Chances are, they’re
wrong. Start your own group, be
the only member, and have your
own “Pride Day.” Personally, I
think I might just stay in my room
for a few days until this whole
thing blows over. Then again, I’d
probably offend someone.

reacts to student's letter

accept your categorization of ho-
mosexuality with lying, stealing,
and harming other people. To do so
would be an act of self-hatred on
my part, an act of total disrespect
for who I am and how I live and
love in this world.

My desire for women is
about love, about fundamental
human connection, about spiritual-
ity. It is not simply about a single
“act” in bed. Such a reduction of
my personhood is unfair. Dave,

point (and I’m not saying this is
conscious or malicious — but it is
insidious) is a myth much of our
culture operates under, a myth that
goes something like this: Straight
people make love, gay people have
sex, If you think back a little in
US. history, you'll see that this is a
recycles formula, once cast in racial
terms to justify the rape and abuse
that white people perpetrated on
Africans, Native Americans, and
other peoples of color. (That’s

“And | think
it is the lesbian in me, the intensely
woman driven part of myself, that is the
well-spring of my
spirituality.”

imagine if you were really in love
with a woman, and the two of you
had built a relationship together
that was the most important thing
in the world to you. Maybe you’re
in such a relationship now, or
maybe this is the kind of relation-
ship you see your parents in. In any
case, imagine that you’re in this
kind of loving, supportive, sustain-
ing connection with a woman, and
someone comes along and equates
this most important thing in your
life with lying, stealing or harming
other people. How would you feel?
What if people told you that it’s
okay to feel like you’re in love with
this woman, but it would be wrong
to act out a relationship with her?
What would you do?

I think behind Dave’s view-

another story, of course, but not
unrelated. Our country’s power
structure depends upon scapegoats,
and has used a varicty of categories
by which to scapegoat groups of
disenfranchised people, including
religion, sexual orientation, class,
gender, race, and ethnicity).

I truly believe that god put us
on this earth to love as best we can.
And s/he gave us all kinds of ways
to express that love. I believe that
spirituality is developed through
love and compassion. And I think it
is the lesbian in me, the intensely
woman driven part of myself, that
is the well-spring of my spirituality.
My relationships with women have
been a sacred thing in my life. My
lesbianism is not only about sex;
nor is it just one interchangeable

“piece” of my personality. It is
not a removable part of my iden-
tity. I am just as much a lesbian
in the library or the Bison or on
the quad as I am in bed. My en-
lire personhood is suffused with
my lesbianism, and were I never
to have sex (the “homosexual
act?) with another woman for
the rest of my life, I would be no
less a lesbian for that fact.

I'll end by saying that I
think it’s dangerous to think that
we can separate any one part of
ourselves out from another. I
believe that our sexual selves are
very much connected to our emo-
tional selves, our rational selves,
our physical selves, our spiritual
selves. My sexuality is informed
by my spirituality, just as my
spirituality is informed by my
sexuality. It’s when we start
compartmentalizing ourselves
and cutting ourselves into litle
pieces that we open the door for
dehumanization. Whether we are
gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight,
our sexual orientation is not
about who we sleep with, but
about who we fall in love with.
Our orientation comes from love,
which is the most intense, life-
centered energy we experience as
human beings. It is disrespectful
and tragic to think that any of us
should try to suppress the very
energy we nced to sustain our
health as physical and spiritual
beings.

sexual orientation. These are simple
things that gay men, lesbians, and
bisexuals have not yet been able to
secure as viable, safeguarded op-
tions for their lives. You know, I
think if there was more “hetero-
sexual awareness”, people would re-
alize how heterosexist our culture is,
and might support
everyone’s human
right to live and
love to their full
physical and spiri-
tual potential. I also
think if more het-
erosexual men had
some real pride,
there would be a lot
less rape and batter-
ing in this country.

Finally, I
would like to address the “Hetero-
sexual Pride Day” ad campaign it-
self, particularly the confusion be-
tween the group “F.A.G. (Friends of
Anti-Gays)” and Evan Maloney’s
“Ad Hoc Committee on Hetero-
sexual Awareness.” The first sign
which appeared on a campus bulle-
tin board read, “Show Your Support/
For Heterosexuality/By Wearing a
Coat & Tie/(No Jeans) On/Wednes-
day,/17 April 1991/(Heterosexual
Pride Day)/Sponsored by F.A.G.

The most compelling argu-
ment may be, “Hey, nobody is mak-

a lot of students who eat there do so
because they can’t afford the meal
plan and many residence halls don’t
have cooking facilities, As many
know, cooking in the residence hall
rooms is prohibited by Residential
Life. Once again, I know that every-

phasize that these were indeed the
first signs to go up, as members of
the student body, support staff, and

this first sign, “sponsored by
F.A.G.”, comprised a major part of

connected, order.”

deans’ office, residential life, student
life and the chapel were present to
discuss how we might address the
homophobic sentiment of these fli-
ers. This meeting was followed by
an interview conducted by Daily
Item reporter Tony Esposito, who
was collecting data for a story on
homophobia at Bucknell, and
Susquchanna Universities. The
“F.A.G.” sign, which had just been
posted the night before (April 3rd),
was used as a “showpiece” of Buck-
nell homophobia during that inter-

one is doing their job and that no
one intends any malice in their ac-
tions. But Dining Services, and all
those who oversee them, might
want to ask themselves a serious
question. Should the Bison be op-
eratcd as a profit-maximizing, rev-
enue enhancing entity or should
they make every effort to provide
affordable food service to students,

prefer the latter.

Freshman flies over Lewisburg

By Sean McCarthy

Have you ever wondered what
it would be like to fly? To have the
freedom to wander the blue skies at
will? Maybe you’ve dreamed about
what it would be like to have your
own personal plane at your disposal?
For mechanical engineering major
John Shuttleworth 94, these things
aren’t a dream. In fact, John has his
own Piper Arrow-4, a four-seat, one-
propeller passenger plane, parked at
an airstrip in Lycoming. He flies at
least three times a month, or when-
ever he gets a chance. But how did
he get involved in the world of avia-
tion?

Flying was a part of John’s life
from the moment he was born. His
father, a high-tech electronics sales-
man, learned how to fly planes for
his business. Shuttleworth Inc
transported various types of automa
tion equipment all over the country
Not only did John’s father use planes

for business, but he also took the
family on vacations in them. In fact,
as an infant, John would actually ride
with his father on these trips in a
small, specially-designed crib on the
family plane.

John grew up with airplanes,
getting as much experience and
guidance from his father as he could.
He learned many of the ins and outs
of the design, production, mainte-
nance and operation of airplanes.
Finally, when he was 18, John ap-
plied for his pilot’s license. He ex-
plains, “It’s not that hard; there are
basically four steps you have to
complete, though not in any specific
order. You need 40 hours of flight
experience, 20 with an instructor,
and 20 solo...then an FAA flight in-
spector takes you up and has you do
certain necessary maneuvers: taking
off, landing, and keeping control of
the plane...Finally, you have to pass
a written test based on all the rules
and regulations of the sky...”

Due to the success of the
Shuttleworth’s business, John’s fa-
ther decided to buy more planes. At
the latest count, the family owns
four. Therefore, when John came to
Bucknell, he was able to bring one
of them with him. While the Piper is
good for travel, and gets fairly good
gas mileage, it is not able to execute
many acrobatic maneuvers. Back
home in Huntington, Indiana, the
Shuttleworths have an old World
War II trainer called an AT-6G.
Nicknamed “The Texan,” this plane
is very maneuverable, and according
to John “a lot more fun.”

John and his father restored
“The Texan” to working order about
six years ago. It flew fairly well, but
there were several small hidden
flaws. After several further restora-
tions, it now flics with no trouble at
all. However, in “The Texan,” John
had one of his closest calls. Right
after John and his father had first
restored the plane, they decided to

Just in time, cherry trees magically bloom

take it up and try some acrobatics,
not realizing that the canopy that
shielded John from the wind was
loose. John explained that when you
are doing such complicated maneu-
vers in a 600 horsepower plane, it is
important to keep the plane stabi-
lized. However, since his father was
still learning how to do high-gravity
barrel rolls, he was not able to keep
the plane as steady as he would have
liked. As a result, a series of vibra-
tions caused John’s canopy to ex-
plode. The two were able to safely
land the plane, and as John explains,
“Tt wasn’t too bad...it just got a little
windy up there for awhile.”

At Bucknell, John pursues his
aviation interests not only by flying
his Piper three times a month, but
also by collaborating with a Buck-
nell professor to build an ultralite
plane. In the productions lab in the
basement of Dana Engineering, John
works with Project Development
Laboratory Supervisor George
Waltman on both design and assem-
bly of the ultralite. They hope to
have the plane done by summer, but
i's up in the air who will actually
have the bravery to fly it.

In the near future, John is
thinking about setting up a local
shuttle service to nearby cities. Be-
fore he does so, he'll need to get his
commercial flying license which
will allow him to charge people for
trips. He anticipates that he will be
flying people to New York, Phila-
delphia, Boston, Pittsburgh and
other cities. After college, one of the
things John wants to pursue first is a
short career with the Air Force. “I
want to fly high performance jets
while I’m still young...it won’t be
much fun when I’m 50.”

When asked what flying
meant to him, John paused and sat
back, “That’s a tough question be-
cause it does mean a lot to me, I
mean, I just enjoy sitting around
talking about [flying]...1 have been

given the opportunity to do things
that most people only dream of, like
air shows across the Midwest... Fly-
ing is three-dimensional, you can’t
go upside down or dive in a
car...Most importantly, flying is
free- you can go anywhere...Some
people stand on the ground, look up
and think, ‘Gee, I'd like to be up
there near that cloud’ and with fly-
ing, it can be done.”

He concluded by saying that,
“Aviation is a combination of free-

dom, novelty, and power- you
wouldn’t believe some of the incred
ible things you can do.”

Do they sense that it’s Parents ‘ Weekend?

By Sue Basalla
Staff Writer

Ever notice that the campus
changes its appearance before
Spring Weekend each year? Just in
time for visiting parents and
alumni, the cherry trees on the quad
burst into bloom and full-grown
daffodils suddenly pop up in places
that you never saw them before.

Does this spontaneous out-
door accessorization seem a little
too coincidental to you? Does

Bucknell really hire people to paste
cherry blossoms on trees in the dead
of night?

According to campus folklore,
Physical Plant employces spray the
cherry trees with a mysterious
chemical each spring in order to
coax the buds into flowers at the ap-
propriate time. But is there any truth
to this legend?

Frankly, no. George Trepp,
who handles all horticulture for the
Physical Plant, reports that the tree
trunks, not the branches, are indeed

sprayed around this time of year.
The oil spray prolongs the life of the
trees, he said, by killing a bore in-
sect that lives in the bark. Trepp
added, however, that if the spray
touches the buds, they too will be
destroyed. So, the myth couldn’t be
farther from the truth.
Right: The cherry trees on the
Academic Quad have not yet
bloomed, but, as soon as parents
arrive, flowers will mysteriously
appear.

Management 101: The big

The Bucknellian

sell

Popular course teaches “efficency, effectiveness and community”

By Susan Smith
Staff Writer

The students behind the table
in the Langone Center lobby look
anxious to please. In front of them
they have stacks of boxers, or T-
shirts, or maybe Chipwiches. In the
back of their minds, they harbor vi-
sions of service projects which de-
pend on the sale of the boxers and
thoughts of the final presentations to
the Board of Directors that are
scheduled to take place in three
weeks. Some potential customers
pass quietly by the tables, while
others stop to examine the products
of this scmester’s Introduction to
Organization and Management
classes. Many of these customers
can relate to the excitement and
worries that fill the minds of the
salespeople since they are them-
selves alumni of one of the most
popular courses at Bucknell Univer-
sity, MG101.

When MG101 alumna Kate
Fink’93 walked through the LC and
saw the tables, she remembered try-
ing to sell “bottle sleeves” in the fall.
According to Fink, “It was a trying
experience. I wanted people to buy
our product because they liked it, but
I also just wanted to sell them. We
tried not to be pushy, but there was
always the stress of not selling out
and not being able to finance our ser-
vice project. At the end of the se-
mester though, I was sad to dissolve
my company. We had become very
close through the experience.”

Madelienne Casagrande ’91,
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of
this semester’s Company B, admit-
ted, “There is a lot of stress involved.
My frustration level was very high
at the middle of the semester. Our
operation plans were duc right after
Spring Break and these pre-controls,
when the loan proposal is approved
or rejected, decided whether we
made it through the rest of the se-
mester.”

Scott Pericelli ’°94, CEO of

. Company D, also felt the pressure.

He said, “Getting everything orga-
nized was the most difficult part.
You were all depending on each
other, but you didn’t know everyone
that well yet, and didn’t really know
if it would all get done.”

Welcome to the world of or-
ganization, leadership, and MG101!
Because Professor of Management
John Miller felt that students needed
to learn organizational skills and de-
velop leadership traits, he developed
this “hands-on” course. He felt that
some human interaction skills just
couldn’t be taught in a textbook.
(see sidebar this page)

Miller also felt that all liberal

arts students, not just business ma-
jors, should be exposed to the basics
of management. Thus, MG101 is a
course primarily designed for sec-
ond-semester freshmen and first-se-
mester sophomores. Each class be-
comes a “company,” composed of
thirty to forty students who organize
themselves into five divisions— Ser-
vice, Business, Human Resource
Management (HRM), Report, and
Finance. The company members
elect a CEO and Vice-Presidents for
each division.

Phil Elliot 93, Vice-President
of HRM for last fall’s “Campus
Cheekwear” remembered the job
placement as one of the most diffi-

ourselves, “Dare to Be Different.”

The service projects that the
four companies chose to devote their
time and profits to this semester are
cleaning up the Bull Run River in
Lewisburg, working with the elderly,
throwing a party for foster children
and their siblings, and helping the
Mifflinburg and Lewisburg food
banks.

Prof. Miller commented,
“Some think that it’s (MG101) orga-
nized around the service project be-
cause we’re a bunch of do-gooders.”
Actually, service projects are central
to MG101 because “organizations
exist to make a difference in others’
lives.” Also, it was only once there

cult tasks. He recalled,” There were
many conflicts of interest because
everyone wanted to work in Busi-
ness and no one would choose to
work in Report. I had to devise a fair
way of placing everyone in jobs and
keeping them happy. When, for the
sake of success of the company,
Dave Scott [’93] volunteered to head
the Report Division, everyone was
so relieved.”

Company members are also
relieved when the business and ser-
vice projects are determined. For
two weeks, students brainstorm
ideas ranging from Bucknell male
and female of the month calendars
to final exam survival kits to
shotglasses.

Scott Pericelli of Company D
says, “We debated between food and
Guatemalan multi-colored woven
belts. (Company member) Frank
Casey [’93] was very high-spirited
about doing something different so
we voted for the belts and named

were two departments— Service and
Business— that some “really interest-
ing Organizational things began to
take place.’ It takes skill to coordi-
nate the two projects.

Every company faces some
great crisis during the course of their
semester. Company B of last fall
thought that they had a very timely
T-shirt when they designed the logo
“BU-Dry”. Then the “Halloween
Riot” took place and Bucknell was no
longer “dry.” Luckily for them,
Vince DeCerchio of the department
of security bought a large number of
the T-shirts as a memento of how
Bucknell used to be.

Miller says, “There are no
“best”? companies. All companies
have very interesting problems; their
success depends on how they solve
them.” Bucknell Mad Hatters of the
Fall of 1988 experienced problems
with their supplier. The contract
didn’t specify who was responsible
for damaged hats.

Success also depends upon
adhering to two key “‘Millerisms”.
The first is: “The probability that
May 15 will fall on May 15 is very
high,” meaning that meeting dead-
lines is crucial. The second is,“ The
world has seen more than enough
organizations that run efficiently
but shouldn’t be done at all.” Miller
explained, “Successful companies
ask themselves, ‘What do my cli-
ents need from me?” They don’t
develop a product that the company
wants, but rather one that their tar-
geted consumer group will like.”
And buy.

Bankruptcy is a possibility
for companies who do not work out
their problems and cannot sell their
product. This has only happened
twice in the history of the program,
however. Miller explains that when
a company fails it,“files a Chapter 7
paper, consults the Business Law
professors, appoints a trustee, and
turns over the remaining inven-
tory.”

But usually, Miller said, “It
simply doesn’t take all that much
effort to get them to manage them-
selves.... I’m stunned every se-
mester at the degree to which these
students come to own these
projects.” Kim Maxwell ’93 of this
semester’s Chipwich company
would agree. She said, “The com-
pany is hard to separate from real
life because you get so caught up in
it... You don’t want to let your co-
workers down.”

Celebrations take place when
everyone comes together to ac-
complish a goal. Casagrande said,
“We were ecstatic after selling out
of Chipwiches. The next working
session we brought in some of the
more undesirable Chipwiches— the
ones that had melted when a freezer
broke down- and had a party with
our T.A.s.”

A traditional company party
takes place after the oral presenta-
tion to the board and the handing-
over of the company archives,
which include company newslet-
ters, minutes, financial statements,
markct research, contingency plans,
and financial statements. Prof.
Miller usually joins in the celebra-
tion.

All of these late-night efforts
have their effects. Paul Kahn 91
said, “Management is like having a
freshman hall all over again. You
establish friendships and ties that
last long beyond the solvency of
your company.”

Miller summed up, “I find
that 2 or 3 years afterwards the
memories are still vivid. MG101
leaves an impression.”

Professor

Miller

manages MG 101

By Susan Smith
Staff Writer

“T’m the only man who has
ever served as the chairman of the
board of 87 companies,” smiles
Professor of Management John
Miller, as he explains the history
of Management 101 (MG101), a
course he brought to Bucknell 13
years ago.

Miller conceived the idea
for the introductory management
course while teaching at Yale
University. At the time his upper-
division class was working on
mini-projects. It was on a day in
1976, which Professor Miller still
vividly recalls, that he realized the
strong need for an introductory
management course for liberal arts
students. A woman who was then
a senior at Yale remarked to him
that day that, “She had been living
with a manager for about 20 years
without having the slightest idea of
what he did, or why.” Miller real-
ized “something very, very im-
portant. These people (that he
taught) would be leaders sometime
in their life. Inevitably they would
be called upon.” All students
needed to learn how “emotionally
engaging, how interesting it is to
work with other people.”

In the fall of 1977, Yale up-
perclassmen could elect to try
Miller’s new management course.
Remembering the first year of
MG101, Miller said, “It was one
of Yale’s and my personal teach-
ing disasters. Inventing everything
from scratch was one of the most
painful experiences. It was very
difficult. Students need structure,
clarity, deadlines. Thank goodness
I had very patient and bright stu-
dents. We tried again the next time
without being so radical.”

A year later, Miller received
a call from Bucknell. At the time,

Bucknell had the standard three-
day-a-weck lecture class taught in
Vaughan Literature Auditorium. In
the fall of 1979, though, the pilot
MG10I1 class entertained the cam-
pus with a Casino Night. At the
beginning, companies chose to ei-
ther work on a business or service
project. Starting in the fall of 1982,
companies were required to de-
velop a business project which
would in turn finance a service
project. Also in that year, the
Board of Directors began to assess
a 10% income tax of revenues to
cover bankruptcies.

Miller's MG101 course,
which has been improved again
and again over the years with the
help of his colleagues, is now be-
ing copied at other universities.
This spring, Clarkson University
adopted the Bucknell model after
observing MG101 last fall. Their
upperclassman division is “exactly
MG101.” Miller said proudly,
“They use my textbooks, the same
mission statement, even the same
grading system.” John Carroll
University’s carefully controlled
comparison of Miller’s course with
the standard introductory lecture
showed that the students clearly
preferred the “hands-on” method
The MG101 formula proved to be
a much more successful way of
teaching the dynamics of organi-
zation and leadership.

Numerous publications
about MG101 have been printed as
well. This month the Journal of
Management Education, which
Miller said is the “number one
journal in the ficld,” featured an
article on the MG101 method.

This summer, Miller will
travel to France and Eastern Eu-
rope to present the course to Eu-
ropean educators. Commented
Miller, “The Bucknell model is
rapidly becoming well-known, not
Only nationally, but abroad.”

Bison Tales

By Marc Haimes
Staff Writer

We were required to print
our names neatly on the brown
bags brimming with lunchtime
goodies from home. It was a
strictly enforced ‘Camp Wilder-
ness’ rule. This way, no cunning
camper could claim the cupcake
and cheese-curls for his own, un-
less his cognomen matched the
signature on the container. How-
ever, there was another more
malicious reason for this rule...

Everyday, after lunch, cer-
tain counselors would collect the
lunch bags that were not properly
placed in a trash basket but rather
carelessly flung on the ground.
They would then stroll to the an-
nouncement pavilion and scom-
fully shrick out each name
scripted on the offending parcels
The embarrassed litterbug would
then have to get up and retrieve
the bag in front of every kid in the
entire camp. Observers would
smugly stare and monotonely
croon, “ewwwwwwwww.” (As
in “ewww you're innnnn
troublececee.” Not like
“euwwww gross.”) This squash-
ing punishment would blemish
untidy felons with a dull shame
that not even free swim could
wash away.

Certain kids were so petri-
fied of the aforementioned hu-
miliation that they would cram
entire sandwiches in their mouth,
rush to throw their bag away, and
then stand guard by the bin for the
remainder of lunch to make sure
it stayed inside. Camp Wilder-
ness quickly became the cleanest
camp in the country, maybe even
the world.

As the campus administra-
tion makes the decision about
whether to publish the names of
students guilty of violations, I beg
them to note that the above story
could easily be translated into
modem terms.

Suppose Joe, an average
Bucknell student, decides one
Saturday night that he is going to
strip off all his clothes and run
around naked shooting out win-
dows with a B.B. gun. Editor’s
Note: We wish to stress to perus-
ing parents that something this
ludicrous could never really
happen at Bucknell, but the au-
thor is using this obviously exag-
gerated example to make a point.
Well, if Joe’s name were not
made public, then at some later
date he might actually decide to
do the same thing again. Perhaps
he’ll get tired of windows and

move on to leash-less dogs or pe-
destrians. However, if Joe’s ac-
tions, his name, and perhaps even
a picture of the broken windows or
the offending moon are published
immediately, he would suffer
countless negative effects on his
social life...

Female Student #1: Hey,
there goes Joe in that raincoat. Did
you know he’s a double major in
astronomy and military science?
He’s really cute and J like the way
he dresses.

Female Student #2: Are
you joking? Stay away from him!
Didn’t you hear what Joe did last
night... whisper, whisper,whisper.

Female Student #1:
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwew.

Joe’s classroom perfor-
mance would be affected as
well...

Joe: Sorry that I couldn’t
come to class on Monday, Profes-
sor. I had a real bad cold.

Professor: Acold? Really?
Gecece? I can’t imagine how you
Per-
haps it has something to do with
THE FACT THAT YOU WERE
RUNNING AROUND CAMPUS
COMPLETELY NAKED ON
SATURDAY NIGHT PLAYING
WITH YOUR GUN!!!

Entire Class [in unison}:
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww.

Joe: Oh yeah. Maybe that’s
why, new that you mention it.

I think it would be safe to
say that if Joe had any sense left in
his B.B. sized brain, he would
probably stifle his next urge to
practice gunnery in the buff. Other
students, observing Joe’s social
plummet, would think twice be-
fore exhibiting their own marks-
manship skills

Now perhaps John Dunlop
truly believes what he so simply
stated in last week’s Bucknellian:
“There is no evidence that pub-
lishing one’s name in a newspaper

could have acquired a cold

serves as a deterrent to repeated
misbehavior on the part of the in-
dividual or that it deters others
from engaging in the same or
One would
hope that would be the case and
that appears to be the paramount
argument for full
disclosure... However, there sim-
ply is no data to support a deter-
ring aspect to this practice.” But as
a child who spent his summer
lunchtimes frantically eyeing
waste pails with a bad case of ner
vous indigestion, I would beg to
differ,

All-nighters paralyze your brain!

Campus psychologist and physician offer advice on academics

By Lisa Lipari
Staff Writer

Joe Student has a test tomor-
row. He’s freaking out. There seems
to be no choice but to stay up all
night studying. Joe later realizes that
this was a big mistake and wonders
if it’s because he can hardly think, or
because he fell asleep during his
exam...

Joe is not alone. He knows this
because all of his classmates had that
same glassy-cyed, incoherent ex-
pression at the exam. As a matter of
fact, all-nighters are pretty common
on college campuses.

Maybe if Joe had kept up with
his work during the semester he
wouldn’t have had to pull an all-
nighter. But he, like college students
everywhere, finds it casier to pro-
crastinate than to study each night.
It’s not that students intentionally
avoid studying their notes or text-
books. It’s just easier to complete
written assignments that will be col-
Iccted (like term papers, labs, etc...).
So while a student is constantly
working, he or she can still fall be-
hind. The most common reason for a
student to procrastinate is because
the subject matter may not be all that
interesting to the student. Joe, for
example, may find it easier to study
philosophy rather than physics be-
cause he likes philosophy better.

There are some students who
slay up all night studying because
they are perfectionists and no matter
how much they study, it’s never
enough. (This is not Joe.) If there is
sull another page to read, another
note to take or another table to
memorize, they will not rest until it
is done. Of course perfection is un-
attainable, and these people, like the
procrastinators, will soon figure out
that all-nighters are not the way to
go

If a student stays up all night
writing a paper, watches it print out
as the sun comes up, and then turns
it in, the finished product is done,
and the student can then relax. But
the student who was up all night
“preparing” for an exam is not yet
done; there’s still the exam to con-
tend with. Unfortunately, Joe was
fighting a losing battle because not
only did he stay up all night to study,
he had to take an exam which re-

quired thinking and reasoning.
Most exams at Bucknell re-
quire analytical thinking, assessing
problems, and problem solving,
rather than rote memorization. A
student may know the information
by heart and still do poorly on the
exam. This is because few students
integrate lecture notes with the text
or with the main concepts of the
course. Having studied all night, a
student may become frustrated if he
or she can’t remember the informa-
tion just studied hours before; this
may then cause the student to panic,

Bon errr... Appetite

As a service to our readers,
we, the god and goddess of dining,
have compiled a special dining
guide for Spring Parent’s Week-
end. Enjoy.

Breakfast

Perkin’s (Route 15, Lewis-
burg) provides the “franchise ap-
proach” to breakfast, featuring the
standard egg dishes at moderate
prices.

Good Wiil’s Restaurant
(Route 45, Montandon) offers a
very Central Pennsylvanian cul-
tural experience. Local farmers
and fishermen dine and talk plows
and lures in the early hours of the
morning until the college “hang-
over” rush takes over around
noon. The food is fantastic and the
Prices you simply cannot beat!

The Lewisburg Hotel
(Market St., Lewisburg) serves
breakfast in a much more formal

and civilized atmosphere. Located in
the heart of downtown Lewisburg,
it’s a convenient stop before the
spring football game.
Brunch

Sunday brunch is a real treat
at Peking Gardens Chinese Res-
taurant (Route 15, Lewisburg). A
large buffet service geatures egg
rolls, sweet and sour chicken, fried
rice, chicken and brocolli, beef lo
mein, shrimp with steamed veg-
etables and free chopsticks for all!

Lunch

Lickety Split (Market St.,
Lewisburg) is a lot more than an ice
cream store — they offer excellent
croissant sandwiches, quiches, sal-
ads and soups. And, of course,
there’s lots of ice cream for dessert!

The Bull Run Inn (“The
Bar”) and the Towne Tavern (Mar-
ket St., Lewisburg) offer excellent
burgers and sandwiches at reason-
able prices. If you want a brew with
your lunch, “The Bar” and “Tavern”
hold two of the coveted liquor li-
censes in town.

which further decreases the student’ s
ability to perform well on the exam.

While Joe would never use
anything other than coffee to stay
awake, many students use products
such as Vivarin, NoDoz, and other
“alertness aids.” Dr. J. Preston
Hoyle, director of student medical
services, said that some students use
weight reduction pills and even am-
phetamines to stay awake. Said
Hoyle, “I tend to see the people who

have problems.” He explains those
problems and then tells them how
they can avoid the problem alto-
gether. He also explained that the
negative physical effects caused by
alertness aids can come at the most
inopportune time, such as during an
exam. Hoyle added that “the
student’s tolerance [to such aids] in-
creases to a point at which they don’t
work,”

Rosaria Gabricle, Assistant
Director of Psychological Services
for Outreach, feels that there is a
strong connection between the mind

and the body, and that when the
mind becomes stressed the body
becomes stressed as well. Students
who frequently pull all-nighters feel
that there just aren’t enough hours
in the day, and may feel over-
whelmed by their workload. While
some students are more able to
handle all-nighters than others,
“students should get at least two or
three hours of sleep [before an
exam],” said Gabriele. During this
time the brain can process the infor-
mation studied and store it for later
use.

When students stay up more
than one night a week, they can ex-
perience sleep deprivation and may
become irritable, less patient and
less able to concentrate, according
to Gabriele. According to Hoyle,
“You incur a debt, a sleep debt; you
don’t pay that debt with one night’s
sleep.”

Asked about special strate-
gics for coping with finals week,
professionals agree that students
should study for an exam, take it,
take a nap, and then do something
unrelated for a short while. While
studying for exams, it is usually best
to study for a while, take a short
break, and then begin studying
again, although different methods
work differently for different
people. Joe, for example might
study for an hour, take a five or ten
minute break, and then hit the books
again.

Although everyone (includ-
ing Joe) has heard the same advice
given time and time again, and even
though it’s true, most people don’t
follow it. So the advice to these
stubborn, I’ ve-always-done-it-this-
way students is to study hard, but
don’t stay up all night. Either get
some sleep before your exam or do
something totally unrelated. Or call

yesterday’s picture perfect weather
to gain a double-header split with

the Bison’s record now stands at 17-

to the Engineers in the make-up

game on Tuesday. This was a par-
ticularly disappointing loss since
Lehigh came in with a miserable 1-7
conference record, 5-13 overall. The
loss to 6-19 Susquchanna was also
disappointing, although the Bison
did rest many of their regulars
against the Division II Crusaders.
Bucknell coasted to a 7-2 vic-
tory in the first game yesterday be-
hind the outstanding pitching of Jim
Stevens ’94. Making his first colle-
giate start, Stevens (2-0,1.98 ERA)
hurled a seven-inning complete
game allowing just two runs on six

hits. The runs scored after the Bison
had already given him a 7-0 cushion.

The Bison scored twice in the
first inning off the Susquehanna
Starter, John Walter, on an RBI
single by Roger Ahrens 91 and an
RBI double by Mark Kennedy ’92.
Steve Gyimesi ’93 broke the game
open in the fourth with a three-run
homer to left field—his first round
tripper of the year,

ond game, Susquehanna right fielder

Tennis heads off to Patriot
League Championships

By Mike Markovich
Staff Writer

Due to more raimouts, the
men’s tennis team played another
relatively light schedule this week.
Saturday’s match versus Patriot
League adversary Fordham was
scrapped, as was Wednesday’s
scheduled match at Franklin &
-Marshall.

The only match actually
played last week was against another
Patriot League opponent, Lafayette,
on Tuesday, dominating them 8-1.
This match provided Head Coach
Craig Reynolds and the team with a
much-needed opportunity to see
what kind of competition they can
expect from the teams around their
conference as they prepare for the
League Championships this weck-
end at Colgate. A normal dual match
against Colgate today should help
provide another such view of what is
to come on the following two days.

But most of the Ieague’s talent
has not been seen by Bucknell this
year. They have only played two
league matches to date, with a third
today, but their chances for the
weekend appear good if these can be
used as indicators. The first was a
close 5-4 victory over Lehigh, and
the second was Tuesday’s contest at
Lafayette.

The. fact that Bucknell lost
only one match on the afternoon
would seem to indicate that the team
is peaking just in time for the scason-
ending toumament. Bucknell swept
the singles matches, with only
Jerome Charlier ’92 needing a third
set to down his opponent. Charlier
played at his usual number one
singles spot and was victorious 2-6,
6-2, 6-3.

The rest of the singles matches
were straight set affairs, At number
two, Bruno Barbera ’94 took the win
7-6 (7-5), 6-0. The rest of the Buck-
nell singles sweep saw Andrew
Cantor ’92 win at number three 6-3,
7-5, Cris Stenstrém victorious at
number four, 6-2, 6-4, captain Scott
Bank on top 6-3, 6-3 at number five,
and Chris Rimpel ’93 rounding out

the field with a W at number six, 6-
1, 6-2.

Bucknell’s Achilles’ heel
came at number one doubles, where
Charlier and Rimpel were defeated
5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2). The other
doubles matches were captured by
the Bison, with Barbera and Cantor
taking the number two contest 6-4,
6-4, and Stenstrém and Bank
avenging a first sct loss to come back
and win 2-6, 6-2, 6-0.

The 2-1 doubles record
brought the final match score to 8-1
in Bucknell’s favor. This in turn
brought their season mark to 6-5, 2-
0 in the conference.

It is this type of play that

to bring to

Colgate tomorrow for their dual
match and the following League
Championships. Despite having
played only the two conference
matches, the team’s lineup for the
weckend looks hard to beat on pa-
per.

Acting on 20 years’ coaching
experience, Reynolds has formu-
lated this year’s conference team
after observing how certain players
perform at different positions, and,
for doubles, with different partners.
Perhaps hoping to hold the level of
play where it was for the Lafayette
match, Reynolds entered a lineup for
the Championship Weekend which

Bison the 4-1 loss. Starter Tim
Murray went all the way for the
Crusaders, allowing only an RBI
single to Mike Kearns ’93. Ted
Obligado ’91 had a good game at the
plate, going three for three.

Rich Heller °94 started for
Bucknell and pitched well, allowing
no runs on three hits in four innings,
despite walking four. Another fresh-
man, Scott Gerhardt (0-1) did not
fare as well, giving up three runs on
one hit and two walks in only one
third of an inning.

On Tuesday, homers by
Kennedy and Koerner were not
enough to overcome Lehigh’s 11-hit
attack on Bison pitchers Dan
Krewson ’91 (2-2) and Jack
Kazanjian ’93. Koerner had two hits,
and Obligado three, for Bucknell.
Robert Funk pitched a complete
game and Andy Carabillo collected
three hits for Lehigh.

In the first game of Saturday’s
double-header, Koerner doubled and
tripled while driving in two in a 6-2
win for the good guys. Mike Rizzi
"91 tossed his second complete game
of the year to improve his record to
4-2.

Kurt Waldner ’93 won his
third straight game in Patriot League
action in the second game, a 9-5 win.
He allowed just one earned run while
Striking out six. Kennedy and
Gyimesi had three hits each to pace
the Bison attack.

Waldner, the top returning
pitcher from the 1990 team, contin-
ues to impress following early arm
problems. The win over Lehigh im-
proved the righthander’s record to 3-
1, and it was his third complete
game—tops on the staff. Waldner
has a 1.71 ERA in league games and
is responsible for three of Bucknell’s
five conference wins. His 3.21
overall ERA is third on the team to
Koerner (1.58) and Stevens (1.98)

According to Kennedy,
catcher and one of three captains, a
positive attitude and resurgence of
the pitching staff are the biggest

out his knee against Patriot League rival Lehigh at home last Satur-

day afternoon.
reasons for the Bison’s positive
turnaround from last year. “The staff
has been 100 percent better than last
year. Coach [Bob] Mellman and
Coach [Gene] Depew have done a
great job with the pitchers, espe-
cially the freshmen,” said Kennedy.
Kennedy has also been one of
the mainstays of the offense that
sported a .297 team batting average
entering the Susquchanna games.
Ahrens, Patriot League Player of the
Week, entered yesterday’s games
with a club-high .368 average. He
also leads the team in homers
(three), RBI (24), hits (35), stolen
bases (11), and walks (17).
Gyimesi (.347) and Koerner
(.330) have also been red hot lately
Koerner is currently leading the na-
tion with .26 triples per game (seven
in 27 games) and is only three shy of
Ahren’s school record of ten.

Tomorrow the Bison will play
a double dip at Colgate (0-6, 1-18),
with a single game there on Sunday.
Colgate is having a very disappoint-
ing season coming off of last year’s
performance when they won 15
games, the most for a Red Raider
baseball team since 1966. Last yaer
the tcam also set ten single-season
hitting marks and was the first club
to hit for a .300 average in school
history.

On Tuesday, April 30 Mt. St.
Mary’s will be in town followed by

iutsburgh on May 2

Yesterday’s loss to
Susquchanna was the first Bison
loss to a non-Division I team this

season

Women’s Lax to take on
Drexel and Slippery Rock

By Eliza Wampler
Staff Writer

This past week, the womens’
lacrosse team faced the forces of
Villanova and Colgate. The women
suffered two losses with scores of 9-
7 and 11-7 respectively.

At Villanova University April
19, Bucknell came out on fire scor-
ing first before concluding the first
half outscoring Villanova 5-4 in an
extremely fast-paced game. All units
of the team came together to play
very well for the Bison.

The second half showed a
continuation of this high caliber and
aggressive play. The teams re-
mained about equal in their number
of shots on goal during the second
half, but Villanova scored two more
times than Bucknell.

Head Coach Jennifer Averill
commented, “The Villanova game
was our strongest game of the season
thus far. Even though it will not be a
win for our record, it was a victory
for the team. We accomplished ev-
erything that we needed to be suc-
cessful. I don’t think that I could
have asked more of my players.”

The leading scorer for the Bi-
son was Jen Kehoe °94 with three
goals. Trisha Way ’94 had two,
while Dori Lynn Ellwood '92 and
Leslie Why °92 each contributed
one.

On Tuesday, at Colgate , the
Lady Bison once again played a
strong, competitive game.

The big obstacle on the
Colgate squad was a senior, Shari
Krasnoo. Krasnoo is the Raiders’
entire offensive threat and also the
nation’s leading scorer. To combat
Krasnoo, Averill instructed Kristina
Haas °91 and Way to double-team
her all over the field. Haas and Way
did a fantastic job denying her the
ball, allowing her to only score
twice, well below her six goal a

Averill remarked,
“Haas and Way really need to be
commended on their defensive ag-
They took Colgate’s key
player out of the game, causing an
enormous amount of frustration for
her and their team.”

During the first half, the teams
matched up fairly evenly. At half-
time, Bucknell was right in the game
only one goal behind Colgate.

The breakdown occurred in
the beginning of the second half,
when the Bison went through a lag
of about twelve minutes in which
they were entirely on the defensive
end, showing no shots on goal. De-
spite this mental and physical lapse,
the game on the whole was strong,
as Assistant Coach Scott Prestridge
commented, “I don’t think the score

game average

gression.

was reflective of how we played.
Our game plan was to shut down
Krasnoo, and we did that.”

Why lIcad the scoring with
three goals, as Kehoe had two, and
Allison Arth °93 and Way each had
one

With four games remaining in
the season, Averill emphasized that
the entire squad is extremely deter-
mined to finish up strong, “I con-
tinue to have high expectations of
improving our record, and I think
that this weckend is our opportunity
to do so.” The team’s current record
is 3-10 overall, and 1-3 in the Patriot
League. This weckend, they will be
battling Drexcl tomorrow away at 1
p.m., and Slippery Rock 1 p.m.
Sunday at home

Butler

By Mitch Benton
Staff Writer

It’s a phone call that all young
football players dream of receiving.
From Pop Warner to high school and
through college, the player’s ulti-
mate goal is to someday get a chance
to play in the National Football
League. For Bucknell’s Jay Butler
"91, that call finally came last Mon-
day, April 22.

On the line was a representa-
tive from the New York Giants of-
fering Butler a free-agent contract
and a chance to join the reigning
Super Bow! Champions. Butler had
received calls from the Giants, the
New York Jets and the Seattle
Seahawks during last weck’s N.F.L.
draft and was expected to be taken
in its late rounds. Instead, he was
called immediately following its
conclusion by the Seahawks and
Giants. Seattle’s squad did offer
more of an opportunity for the 6'7",
292 pound tackle, but, ultimately,
the better contract and location of-
fered by the Giants won his com-
mitment.

Butler came to Bucknell from
Hillsborough High School, in
Somerville, New Jersey, where he
eared six varsity letters, three each
in football and baseball. He was
equally proficient in both sports and

earned a number of post-season
honors, including being named to the
All-Somerset County and All-Cen-
tral Jersey All-Star Squads. A mem-
ber of the National Honor Society,
he was recognized during his senior
year as Hillsborough High School’s
Outstanding Scholar-Athlete.

Butler arrived in Lewisburg as
a 6' 5", 253 pound center and made
an immediate impact on the football
squad. He quickly earned a spot on
the traveling team and received
Playing time at center, tackle, and
light end, Midway through his
sophomore season, he earned a
Starting spot on the offensive line, a
distinction he would not relinquish
until finishing his career.

During the 1989-90 football
campaign, Butler started the entire
season at right tackle. On the
coaches’ 100 point grading system
for the effectiveness at his position,
he earned an outstanding score of 80
or more four times. These included
an 88 in a 27-12 victory over Co-
lumbia, a game in which he was
named Bucknell’s Outstanding Of-
fensive Player of the Week. He
earned Division I-AA Honorable
Mention All-American status ac-
cording to Don Henson’s Football
Gazette and finished the year earn-
ing the John Campana Award, given
annually to Bucknell’s outstanding

offensive lineman.

For his final collegiate season,
Butler was asked to again change his
position, a task which he meet with
extreme success. From his new left
tackle spot, he anchored the veteran
Bison offensive line, collectively
known as “the Beast”. The line, and
Buder in particular, led Bucknell to
a 7-4 record, its best mark in more
than 25 years, and its second con-
secutive second place finish. For his
efforts, Butler was named to the First
team All-Patriot League Squad and
again won the John Campana
Award.

While playing the season at
tackle, Butler also served as the
Bison’s long snapper for punts and
field goals. It is this versatility that
makes him the most attractive to the
N.F.L., and Giant scouts. He has
played center, guard and tackle and,
while he was the biggest player on
Bucknell’s gridiron team, some say
that he still has room to grow.

After his football career is
concluded, Butler will have an out-
standing future awaiting him, as he
will graduate in June with a bachelor
of science degree in mechanical en-
gineering. But Butler will, at least
for a time, put aside his engineering
background. Today he will report to
the defending champion’s mini-
camp and in the fall, Butler will

Ultimate reaches sectionals

By Scutt Brown
Staff Writer

When it begins to rain and the
ground turns soft and all others head
inside, venture out to the mods and
you will undoubtedly see the
Mudsharks, Bucknell’s Ultimate
Frisbee Team, throwing the disc and
getting ho’(horizontal). Led by Todd
Lieb ’91, the team’s captain, coach,
treasurer and main motivator, the
Mudsharks have increased in size
and become a competitive force this
season,

Ultimate was created in 1968
at Columbia High School in New
Jersey and has since blossomed into
an international sport. The game did
not reach Bucknell until the late
1970’s but it has since prospered due
in part to the laid-back atmosphere.

“There are no cuts: all that we
ask is that people show for up for
practice and hustle when they’re
playing,” commented Lieb on the
reasons the sport has maintained its
appeal. “‘It just takes time to learn the
game. There were guys who came
out and were so bad I wanted to hit
them and now they’re really good.”

The core of the team now con-
sists of about 20-25 guys although
anyone is always welcome to play.
This year has been one of the “hot-
test times” for the Mudsharks since
1981 when the team was ranked one
of the top five in the country. Ulti-
mate has competed in four different
tournaments this year at Allentown,
Penn State, Haverford and

Bloomsburg.

At Bloomsburg the
Mudsharks competed against other
tcams in their sectional. The Sharks
won three of their first four games
beating Drew, Lafayette and
Swarthmore while falling to
Rutgers. In the last, game, having
already qualified for regionals, the
Mudsharks were trailing Haverford
10-1 when a pouring rain added to
already frigid temperatures.

So the team, according to
Lieb, “went nuts and freaked out.
We started to dive in the mud. It was
really funny. We never take the
game so seriously so that it’s not
fun.”

Bucknell qualified for the
regionals at Mt. St. Mary’s in Mary-
land, the last stage before nationals.
Unfortunately the team will be un-
able to attend according to Lieb
“partly due to money but most im-
portantly because of participation.
The team, because of Parents’
Weekend would only be able to
carry seven or eight players instead
of the full squad of 15 or 16, and we
did not want to misrepresent the
team.”

The team names, which show
the colorfulness of the sport, include
the Lafayette Screaming Tomatoes
and the Lehigh Spastic Plastic. The
tournament's rituals are the most in-
triguing, but probably unknown, part
of the sport. For instance, Dartmouth
is called the Moo-disc so the team
brings a cow to the tournaments it
competes in and players ride him

Steve Guenther ’92 freestyles the disc in one of the Mudsharks’ prac-

tices at the mod fields.

around. Drew has a cow skull and
chants to it.

The Mudsharks appropriately
form a shark. Led by Lieb who forms
a shark’s jaw by clamping two discs
together the rest follow behind him,
a few forming fins and a tail, chasing
a minnow, “usually a freshman, un-
til they catch him,” said Lieb. Also,
the Sharks have a toy dinosaur
known as the Squecb from which
they claim they gain power.

All the rituals have been part
of Bucknell’s team for years, al-
though there can always be additions
made. This season, for example,
Chris Williams ’92 brings the two
teams together before the game for a
motivational poem about the plight
of a disc.

The future for ultimate at
Bucknell is looking very strong be-
cause the current team has many
freshmen and a strong core of lead-
ership in Williams and Jeff
Warhover '93. The problem that
does exist, according to Lieb, is the
inability of the University to provide
proper facilities for the club teams.
The University’s attempt to enlarge
the fields behind the mods was un-
successful last year so men’s and
women’s club lacrosse, rugby, and
frisbee, all must try to share Swartz
field.

Even with these constraints,
the Sharks always seem to be able to
squeeze in somewhere to throw the
disc around. So, come rain or sun-
shine, if you’re in the mood for
something a little different and not
afraid to get a little dirty, head down
to Swartz field or behind the mods
and get ho’.

Offensive lineman Jay Butler ’91, pictured during a pre-game practice, has signed to attend the New York
Giants spring try-out camp which begins today. Butler received First Team All-Patriot League honors this
past season in helping to lead the offensive line and the Bison to one of their best seasons in recent history.

hopefully be in the Meadowlands, on
the Giants’ sideline.

But for the meantime, Butler
is striving to become one of the few
Bucknell student-athletes ever to
reach the N.F.L. The recent
standouts include Earl Beecham 86,
who played with the Giants’ “Scab”
team during the 1986 player’s strike,
Ken Jenkins ’81, who played with
the Philadelphia Eagles, the Detroit

Lions, and the Washington
Redskins, and Tom Mitchell 65,
with the Baltimore Colts and the San
Francisco Forty-Niners. Butler is
following a path similar to that of
last season’s most valuable player,
Scott Auchenbach ’90, who also
signed a free agent contract with the
Giants and attended their camp.
Bucknell’s Head Football
Coach, Lou Maranzana, likes

Butler’s future in football. “I’m
pleased to see that Jay’s got an op-
portunity to play in the N.F.L. I’m
very impressed with his determina-
tion and ability, but that level of
competition is a tough challenge for
anybody. I really hope that he can
stay with the Giants. It’s a very dif-
ficult challenge, but I think that it’s
exciting.”

Equestrian finishes second
out of nine and gets ribbon

By Cathy Retallak

The Bucknell Equestrian
Team’s continuous training and de-
votion throughout the year has
gained it regional recognition. When
the points were tallied up from the
fall and spring shows, the Bucknell
team achieved second place out of
the nine colleges and universities in
the region. Other schools in the re-
gion include Penn State, Wilson
College, Pitt, and Indiana University
of Pennsylvania. An excited team
brought home a large ribbon and the
title of Reserve High Point Team of
the Year 1990-91. This is quite an
accomplishment from last year’s
first trek into intercollegiate compe-
tition. Since then the number of ac-
tive members has tripled.

There have been six shows
this year held at various hosting
schools in the region. Each show

ts of five different divisions of

beginner, advanced begin-
ner, novice, intermediate, and open,
which accommodate skill levels
from beginner to experienced riders.

division, each rider competes in both

divisions, the riders compete in one
flat class. For each class, the com-
petitor rides an unfamiliar horse that
has been randomly drawn. This en-
sures that the riders are judged solely
on their riding skills and not on the
horse, which is provided by the
hosting school.

If riders attend most of the
shows and do well, they may accu-
mulate enough individual points to
qualify for the Regional competi-
tion, the equivalent to Conference
championships in other sports. Once
arider has qualified for Regionals he
or she will then be moved up to the
next division.

The last regular show of the
season was held at Penn State on
Saturday, April 13th. This was the
last chance for riders to gain quali-
fying points for Regionals. Some of
the Bucknell riders had qualified
earlier in the season, but for others
their performance on Saturday re-
mained the deciding factor.

The Bucknell Equestrian
Team ended its regular show season
with a strong performance at Penn
State. Despite the cold rainy
weather, the riders showed lots of
enthusiasm. Captain Kelly Kordish
*92 started off the day on a good note
by winning the open flat class and
qualifying herself for Regionals.
President Cathy Retallack ’93 placed
fifth in open jumping. Retallack had
qualified for Regionals earlier in the
season. In the intermediate division
Jocelyn Perot ’94 placed third in
jumping.

Bucknell has three strong
novice riders. Deb Stumpf ’94 with
an outstanding performance, won
her flat class and placed second in

A view of the NBA's second season

By Mike Swanson

There are three certain things
in life: death, taxes and the fact that
the Los Angeles Clippers will be
playing golf and not basketball come
playoff time. Despite the absence of
the Clips, the NBA playoffs should
be as intense and exciting as ever,
with 15 teams attempting to de-
throne the two-time defending
champion Detroit Pistons. Here is
one expert’s view of the NBA post-
season (in case you are scoring at
home, the championship should be
concluded by the beginning of the
Fall Semester).

EAST FIRST ROUND

Chicago Bulls vs. New York

Ewings: The only reason I’m not
predicting Michael and his mates
will order brooms to sweep the floor
of Madison Square Garden is that I
have friends who are Knicks’ fans.
Michael Jordan is simply the best
basketball player on the planet and
not even the defensive prowess of
Kiki Vandeweghe, whom Jordan
calls “the best defensive player in the
>”, can stop him.
Patrick Ewing may break the
record for shots taken in a playoff
series, but there is no other Knick
who can score. The real question in
this series is which Knick Medical
Bill Cartwright will put in the hos-
pital with his lethal elbows. The
Bulls will win in four games.

Boston Celtics vs. Indiana
Pacers: Larry Bird has more fans in
the state of Indiana than the Pacers
do. That alone should give some in-
dication as to how this series will

leag

progress.

The Celtics improved greatly
this year with the acquisition of
young and fast players like Brian
Shaw and Dee “pump it up” Brown
to complement their fantastic vet-
eran trio of Bird, Parish and McHale.

The Pacers are youthful and
on the rise, but are about two years
away from contending. Reggie “I’m

Men’s Lax

difficulty with Penn St. mainly be-
cause of their “inability to get going
in the first quarter.” He said, “Like I
told the team, it looked as if we were
still in the bus. After the first quar-
ter, when they jumped to a 6-2 lead,
we were in the game.”
Commenting on whether the
rigorous schedule may have been a
factor in their lackluster first quarter
play, Jamieson replied, “We work
our kids hard and it’s a long season.
We simply don’t have the depth of a
larger team like Penn State. They
pressured very well and made our
defense play hard.”

in the gym, so I must be open” Miller
and sixth-man extraordinaire Detlef
Schrempf should keep the Pacers
close, but Boston’s experience will
lead them to a three game sweep.

Detroit Pistons vs. Atlanta
Hawks: The old sports cliche says
that defense wins championships.
No team plays better defense in the
playoffs than do the Pistons. Atlanta
is a perfect match-up for the Pistons
because at times it looks as if the
Hawks would rather pass a kidney
stone than the basketball. Dennis
“The Worm” Rodman will stifle
Dominique Wilkins in his attempt to
create more highlight film.

The Hawks have no other
players that could threaten Detroit.
Those factors along with the return
of Isiah Thomas and the clutch play
of Mr. Underrated, Joe Dumars,will
lead the Pistons to win in four
games. By the way, has Ted Turner
been released from the mental hos-
pital he checked into after signing
Jon Koncak to a 6-year, $13.2 mil-
lion contract?

Milwaukee Bucks ys. Phila-
delphia 76ers: Pop Quiz - Name at
least one starter for the Bucks. Nei-
ther can I. Milwaukee amazed the
entire league this year by winning
forty-eight games with such as-
tounding talent as Fred “Psycho”
Roberts, Danny Schayes and Jack
Skima. That sounds more like an
accounting firm than an NBA front-
line.

The 76ers are led by Charles
Barkley, unofficial league leader in
tax-deductible fines, and the dead-
eye three-point shooting of Manute
Bol. Since it seems like half the
Bucknell campus admits to being
fans of Philadelphia, for my health
and well-being, I pick Sir Charles
and his Bump and Thump mates to
spit Team Vertical Leap into the off-
season in Six gamcs.

SECOND ROUND

Chicago vs. Philadelphia: A
rematch of last year. The Sixers held

leads in the fourth quarter in all six
playoff games but only managed to
win two of them. This time around,
they will only win one. The Bulls in
five.

Boston vs. Detroit: The mys-
tique of the famed parquet floor at
Boston Garden will lift the Celtics to
victory in the seventh game. This
series should be hard-fought and
extremely physical. The over/under
on calls Bill Laimbeer whines about
is 25.

EAST FINALS

Chicago vs. Boston: The rau-
cous Chicago Stadium crowd will
lift the well-rested Bulls to a game
seven victory. Michael Jordan will
get his first chance at an NBA cham-
pionship ring after two consecutive
losses in the Eastern Conference Fi-
nals to Detroit. After the series,
Larry Bird will again describe Jor-
dan as God disguised as a basketball
player.

WEST FIRST ROUND

Portland Trail Blazers vs.
Seattle SuperSonics: The only per-
tinent question in Oregon and
Washington is whether the weekly
rainfall in the Pacific Northwest will
be as large as Portland’s margin of
victory. The Trail Blazers proved to
the basketball world that last year’s
tip to the finals was no fluke, and
finished the season strongly by win-
ning 16 of their final 17 games. Their
starting five, led by All-Stars Terry
Porter and Clyde “The Glide”
Drexler, is among the best in the
league and their bench depth is sec-
ond to none. They are clearly the
class of the West.

Seattle does boast standouts
like the manchild Shawn Kemp and
Benoit Benjamin. However, they are
no match for deeper and more expe-
rienced Trail Blazers. The Sonics
have about as much chance of win-
ning a game in this series as the
Mariners do of finishing over .500.

Jamieson stressed that he was
pleased with how the team came
back, even in the closing minutes of
the game. “They made some good
plays, some high-energy plays, even
with four minutes left. Streelman
played very well and Davis and
Schwartz put in some good play, as
well.”

Jamieson assessed the team’s
play thus far as being well above par.
He said, “We are playing better than
we have all season. They know what
they are supposed to do, and now it’s
just a question of getting it all done.
They are beginning to play more
consistently. We have a great team

The Bison will face
Colgate away this week. Colgate
returns their entire attack squad from
last season including Gregg Perry,
who was the leading goal-scorer in
the nation last year based on goals
per game. Jamieson describes this
game as a “must win” game simply
to avenge their embarrassing loss to
Colgate last season.

The Bison also look to finish
strong so that they will have a win-
ning record on the season. With the
puzzle sceming to fit together for the
first time all season, this goal ap-
pears to be more realistic than ever.

Portland in three easy games.

San Antonio Spurs vs.
Golden State Warriors: The
matchup at center pits David
Robinson and Alton Lister. Does
anymore need to be written about his
series? No, but I'll continue anyhow.

The Midwest Division Champ
Spurs are a better team than last
year’s version that lost to Portland in
seven tough games Point Guard Rod
Strickland has improved greatly and
Coach Larry Brown will keep him
out of all nightclubs during the
playoffs. The Admiral had another
fantastic season in winning the re-
bounding title and Willie Anderson
is underrated as a swingman.

Golden State’s incomparable
scoring trio Run-T.M.C.- Tim
Hardaway, Mitch Richmond and
Chris Mullin will raise some hell
against the Spurs, but they won’t be
enough to win more than one game.
Mr. Robinson’s Neighborhood will
remain safe from these Warriors and
the Spurs advance to the second
round in four games.

Los Angeles Lakers vs.
Houston Rockets: The Lakers
showed their age last year in their
lethargic second round loss to
Phoenix. The off-season acquisi-
tions of Sam Perkins and Terry
Teagle turned Showtime into
Slowtime, with the Lakers turning
into a half-court team, Despite carly
season struggles learning new coach
Mike Dunleavy’s new system, the
Lakers still finished with the third
best record in the league. The surge
is due to the Lakers Big Two, Magic
and Worthy (who else?).

The Rockets have been the
hottest team in basketball since the
return of the Nigerian Nightmare,
center Hakeern Olajuwon. Hkenny
Smith is easily this year’s most im-
proved player and guard Hvenon
Maxwell made the most three-point
shots in the regular season. Houston
coach Hdon Chaney is a candidate
for the Coach of the Year after it was
rumored he would be axed at the
conclusion of the year. That was

before his team accumulated the
second-best record in the second half
of the season (behind Chicago).

The Lakers are primed for an
early round exit and the Rockets
could be the team to do it. But not
this year. Magic won’t Ict his team
lose and Worthy will be double-
teamed by Houston players and not
the Houston police on this trip to
Texas. Los Angeles will win the best
first-round series in five tough
games.

Phoenix Suns vs. Utah Jazz:
Question: Will the Jazz and its All-
Star duo of Karl Malone and John
Stockton ever win a first-round se-
ries in the playoffs? Answer: No,
well, at least not this year as Utah’s
only professional team will choke
again.

The Jazz simply don’t have a
good enough supporting cast around
Malone and Stockton to be a threat
in the playoffs. Mark Eaton is a li-
ability at center and the bench is
mediocre at best. Well, at least Utah
has great skiing.

The Suns have some of the
best talent in the entire league with
All-Stars Kevin Johnson, Tom
Chambers, Xavier McDaniel and
super-sub Thunder Dan Majerle.
The problem for Phoenix has been
meshing these individual talents into
a team concept. This could be the
year their potential gels. Coach Cot-
ton Fitzsimmons will give a calen-
dar to Chambers that says it is still
the regular season and that Tom is
allowed to play well. Phoenix’ over-
all talent will defeat the Jazz’s dy-
namic duo in four games.

SECOND ROUND

Portland vs. Phoenix: A
rematch of last year’s Western Con-
ference Finals. Portland won that se-
ries in six games after Sun’s point
guard Kevin Johnson went down
with an injury. The Trail Blazers are
still a superior team, but the acquisi-
tion of Xavier McDaniel will help
the Suns negate Portland’s superior

size. Despite the Blazers deeper
bench, a healthy KJ will lead Phoe-
nix back to the conference finals.
Expect the best dunk of the series to
be by Phoenix’s mascot, the Gorilla.
That ape can throw it down.

Los Angeles vs. San Antonio:
Another case where the Lakers could
easily go down to defeat, but won’t.
Magic realizes that his days are
numbered and he won’t accept los-
ing to a team led by young Rod
Strickland.

David Robinson will eat up
the Yugo import Vlade Diva (even
Robinson’s commercials are better)
and single-handedly keep the Spurs
afloat in the series. The Admiral
won’t be enough however, and Los
Angeles will advance to the confer-
ence finals in seven competitive
games

WEST FINALS

Los Angeles vs. Phoenix: The*
Suns humiliated the Lakers in five?
games in last year’s second round. .
Magic and Co. will obviously be?
looking for revenge this year. They’
will look, but they won’t like whatt
they see.

The key to Phoenix’ stunning :
defeat of the Lakers last year was;
their superior quickness, The same?
holds true this year, except that Loss
Angeles is slower with Perkins and!
Teagle now in the lincup. The Suns
will exploit that advantage again and
win the series in six relatively casy
games. Magic will be his usual phe-
nomenal self, but will fall short of
another championship ring.

NBA FINALS

Chicago vs. Phoenix:
Michael will win an NBA champi-
onship to go along with his 1982
National Championship as a baby
Tar Heel. Although Jordan will be
the star of the finals, his teammates,
especially Pippen and the much-
maligned bench, will contribute im+
mensely and the Bulls will beat
Phoenix in six games.

Track battles at Shi

The Bucknell and Shippens-
burg wack teams rekindled a rivalry
second only to that of the historical
Union and Confederate armies. To
say that these two teams detest one
another would be euphemistic.

onto the cold and rainy track.
Meanwhile, Shippensburg’s Gen-
eral/Coach Bob Walker mounted a
solid defense of their home territory

Last season, both the men’s
and women’s garrisons posted vic-
tories, 85-73 and 93-52 respectively.
This year, however, casualties would
nerease as point totals decreased for
the Bison men. The women, on the
other hand, managed to fulfill their
objective.

Gen. Goulden initiated a suc-

essful first strike on the Red Raid-
ers’ front line. Private First Class Jim
Bock ‘92 received the Congressional
Medal of Honor for his first-place
finishes in the 100 and 200-meter
dashes. Pvt. Bock’s 10.7 second time
in the 100-meter dash qualified him
for IC4A championships. Infantry-

Tennis

man Derek Hamilton ‘94 followed
Pvt. Bock with second-place finishes
in those two events.

Private Mark Lore ‘93 raced to
third place in the 400-meter dash
while Private First Class Jeff Loomis
“92 and Lieutenant Norbert Berenyi
“91 placed second and third in the
800-meter dash, respectively. One of
the first casualties of the afternoon
occurred when Infantryman Jean
Simon ‘94 re-pulled a strained ham-
string muscle and fell to the battle-
field separating his left shoulder.
Before receiving his Purple Heart,
Inf. Simon popped his own shoulder
back into place.

Lt. Berenyi was victorious in
the 1500-meter as Private Tom
Eagleson ‘93 captured third, In the
3000-meter steeplechase, Private
First Class Tom Wuchenich ‘92 and
Private John Lewis ‘93 mounted suc-
cessful assaults finishing first and
second, respectively.

The Red Raiders’ defensive

Private Blaine Fawcett’s ’93 second-
place high-jump effort and Private

ond-place long-jump interrupted a
number of successful Red Raider
offensives. In the shot-put and discus
Licutenant Paul Austin ‘91 captured

second and Private Pete Gregory ‘93
received third in the latter event.

In the climactic confrontation,
Shippensburg’s Lieutenant Chris
Monheim ‘91 used cruel and de-
ceitful methods violating the basic
agreement of the Geneva Conven-
tion when he attacked Bison Pri-
vates First Class Jason Cahilly ‘92
and Matt Deardorff ‘92 from behind
as Lt. Monheim moved into first
place in the 5000-meter race.

For the victorious Lady Bi-
son, Lieutenant Lynnette McBride
‘91, Private First Class Tricia
Plasko ‘92 and Private Julie Diercks
“93 swept the 100-meter dash. Pvt.
F-C Plasko and Lieutenant Alison
Sacger ‘91 captured first and third
respectively in the 200-meter. Other
successful sweeps of enemy Red
Raiders occurred in the 800 and
1500-meter dashes. Private Gina
Abraham ‘93 received Bucknell’s
second Congressional Medal of
Honor for her first-place finishes in
the aforementioned events.
Infanurywoman Cathy Wurster ‘94
captured thrid-place finishes in the
same two events. Fellow
Infantrywoman Beth Muchl ‘94 fin-
ished second in the 800.

Lieutenant Kelly Marsh ‘91
raced to victory in the 3000-meter
as Private Kristin Opdyke ‘93
grabbed second in this event as well

as the 1500. Lt. Marsh earned her
Congressional Medal of Honor by
winning her second event, the 5000-
meter. Lieutenant Colleen O’Mahan
“91 ran to third.

In the 100-meter hurdles,
Lieutenant Karen Shimomura ‘91
exceeded her commanding officer’s
expectations in winning and quali-
fying for ECAC’s with the second-
best Bucknell performance of all
time. Infantrywoman Carla DeBiasi
“94 seized victory in the 400-meter
hurdles and second in the 100-meter
hurdles. Private First Class Geri
Kernisan ‘92 finished second in the
400-meter hurdles.

Lt. McBride achicved the
Congressional Medal of Honor for
her another first-place finish, this
time in the long jump. Private First
Class Lynda Rose ‘92 captured sec-
ond in the long jump and first in the
triple jump. Infantrywoman Dawn
Ellery ‘94 rounded out the Lady
Bison’s scoring with a third-place
finish in the high jump

Next on Gen. Goulden’s
agenda is this weekend’s
Millersville Metric Invitational. The
Bison troops will then return home
the following weekend for the inau-
gural Patriot League Championships
to be held in Christy Mathewson
Memorial Stadium. The event will
be aired live on WVBU 90.5.

reads exactly the same as that used

singles positions, one through six,

reads: Charlicr, Barbera, Cantor,
Stenstr6m, Bank, and Rimpel.

As for doubles, Charlicr and
Rimpel will lead the charge at num-
ber one, and will be backed by
Barbera and Cantor at number two
and Stenstrém and Bank at three

None of these doubles combinations
has yet lost a match in league play,
and overall, Barbera and Cantor is
the only duo to have lost at all.

The only individual singles
records showing league defeats are
those of Stensuém and Rimpel, who
are both 1-1. Looking at the team
Bucknell has to offer, it would seem
that they should finish near the top of
the League

Charlier believes, “The team
to beat this year is definitely Army,
but I don’t foresee them dominating
the tournament. All the teams have
proven, competitive players and in-
dividual performances will deter-
mine which team wins the League
Championship.”

As far as Charlier’s chances in
the number one singles bracket are
concerned, he sees a conference full

Patriot League powers-that-be to
have the tournament pushed back a
week or two. “The season comes to
aclimax too carly. Besides, it would
give everyone another match or two
to prepare,” said Thompson.

Bucknell ended its season with
a 5-3 dual match record. This year’s
team chopped 44 strokes off of last
scason’s Penn State tournament
score

“I'm pleased with our scason
and I’m looking forward to having
everyone back along with some in-

coming players. They’ve got a sea-
son of experience now and hope-
fully the newcomers will add
strength and depth,” concluded
Thompson.

And hopefully Mother Nature
will also improve next season.

Nichols, Fink lead Bison to four out of six

Pitcher of the Week and Player of the Week spark sweeps of both Lafayette and Lehigh

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The women’s softball team
had its six-game winning streak
snapped yesterday by a powerful
Bloomsburg squad, currently ranked
fourth among Division II teams

Bloomsburg was able to come back
in the first game to win 3-1, and went
on to rout the Lady Bison in the
second game 15-1. The losses
dropped Bucknell to a 22-9-1 record
overall with an 8-2 record in league
play, and the Huskies raised their
mark to 31-3.

ter/ The Bucknellian

Wendy Fitz ’94, here seen in a loss earlier against Hofstra, is
Bucknell’s starting shortstop and has played in every game for the

Bison this season.

In the first game Bucknell
spotted senior pitcher Sharon
Nichols ’91 a 1-0 lead in the first
inning when Lisa Fink ’93 doubled,
stole third and came home when the
throw went into leftfield. One run
looked like all that Nichols would
need after coming off a no-hit effort
against Lehigh on Tuesday. How-
ever, the Huskies struck in the top of
the sixth when a line drive off Janet
Buckheit’s bat was dropped by
Karen Smolskis ’91 in deep center
field, which brought in the tying run.
Bloomsburg’s leading hitter, Marty
Laudato .514, then hit a deep sacri-
fice fly to left, scoring Buckheit from
third. Bloomsburg went on to score
one more run on a sacrifice fly in the
inning to wrap up a 3-1 victory. All
three runs scored on Nichols were
uncarned and the loss dropped her to
12-4,

The second game was all
Bloomsburg right from the begin-
ning. The Huskie batters jumped all
over the Bucknell pitchers tagging
them for 16 runs in five innings.
Bucknell was able to avoid the
shutout when Devaney Kerr ’94
crossed the plate in the bottom of the
fifth, but the ten run “mercy rule”
took effect giving Bloomsburg the
16-1 win. Fink took the loss moving
her to 7-5.

“We just have to forget these
games,” said Coach Dale Franquet to
his squad after the second game.
“We have to start thinking about
[Colgate] this weekend.”

The Bison men’s lacrosse

defeating Lehigh 10-5 Saturday and

The Bison won the game 10-5
behind stunning defense and the
unstoppable offensive attack of
Kevin Roth °92 and Mike Conway
*92. Roth led all scorers with six
goals, while Conway provided the
team with the opportunities to score
as he Ied the team with three assists.
Conway’s play was described by
Jamieson as “unbelievable.”

Other scorers for the Bison
included Doug DePietro °92 with
two, co-captain Tom Davis ’91 and
Todd Streelman ’93. Garret
Schwartz 91 added two assists in
the effort.

Colin Barker '94, slowly tak
ing Over the starting job in goal,
provided all the defense Bucknell
needed for the upset, as he stopped
15 of 20 shots. His play thus far this
season has been a pleasant surprise
for the young Bison squad.

Jamieson was thrilled with the
victory on Saturday, stating that it
was a “blue-collar victory.” He
added, “The game was a physical,
tough, hard-nosed type of game
where we executed things better than
they did. We did the things that had
to be done. We cleared the ball ef-
fectively and the defense played
well.”

He noted, however, that much
of the credit for the victory must go
to Conway. He said, “For Conway
to get three assists as a long stick
defenseman is unheard of at this
level of play. He enabled us to con-
sistently pull away in the game.
Even when Lehigh got the ball he
would come up with another gem
and break their momentum. He’s
exceedingly fun to watch play.”

The Bison headed to Penn
State (7-4) on Wednesday where
they were defeated 17-11 after put-
ting in a strong offensive effort.
Roth provided four of the goals for
the Bison, while Streelman and
Schwartz added two apiece. Greg
Brown '92, Justin Zackey '94 and
Davis each scored a goal as well.
Streelman had four assists to lead the
Bison, while De Pietro added two
more.

Barker had a few difficulties in
goal as he was hit with a barrage of
shots. He stopped 13 shots, but al-
lowed the remaining 17 to slip
through.

Patriot League play has been
much more enjoyable for the Lady
Bison, with the exception perhaps of
their South Carolina trip over spring
break. Bucknell dominated Lehigh
on Tuesday sweeping the Engineers
8-1 and 5-0. The series was high-
lighted by superior pitching by
Nichols and Fink. Fink pitched a
two-hitter in the first game, striking
out the Lehigh batters nine times.
The offense was led by three-hit per-
formances by both Heather Hochn
°94 and Jennifer Kalochie ’91.

In the second game Nichols
did two better as she tossed her
fourth career no-hitter, striking out
five batters in the process. It looked
like Nichols might have lost her no-
hit bid in the seventh when a ball
dropped into right field, but Jill
Szafranski ’93 was there to gun the
runner out at first for the final out of
the game. Jennifer Yuengling °93
provided the big bat tripling and
driving in two runs,

On Saturday Bucknell re-
ceived some late inning heroics from
Yuengling to defeat Patriot League
foe Lafayette. Yuengling drove
Hoehn in from third with a sacrifice
fly in the bottom of the eighth in-
ning. This gave Nichols, who came
in to relieve Fink in the eighth in-
ning, her second win of the day and
the Lady Bison a 6-5 victory.

Bucknell sailed through
through the first game guided by a
four-hit pitching performance by
Nichols. Fink tore up the Lady
Leopards’ pitching with a three-for-
three performance, including a home
run and two ground-rule doubles.
Fink also scored three runs and
drove in four more.

Bucknell travel to
Colgate tomorrow to battle the Red
Raiders for second place in the con-
ference as both teams go in at 8-2.
The women must be wary of
Colgate’s deep pitching staff. On
offense the Red Raiders are led by
sophomore Amanda Travis, who

third seed, based on the outcome of

Golf finishes season fourth
at Patriot Leagues tourney

By Chris Drowne
Staff Writer

Upstate New York did its best
Central Pennsylvania impersonation
of constant rain and cold wind last
weekend. As a result, the Patriot
League golf championships at
Colgate were shortened from 54
holes to just 36.

Army and Colgate finished
first and second respectively.
‘Bucknell and Lehigh fought down to
the wire for third, but the Bison came
up two strokes short of the Engincers
in the end.

When asked to comment on
the playing conditions, Bison Head
Coach Tommy Thompson said,
“They were the worst I’ve seen in
my ten years associated with the golf
team. The tournament shouldn’t
have been played.”

Players from every school
were victimized by the additional
lakes on the course turning in results
that looked more like B+/A- test
scores than golf scores. Only four
out of 42 golfers managed to shoot
under 80 on the first day and just two
the following day.

Bucknell’s draw made matters
even worse. The Bison were the last
ones to tee-off after waitingt five to
six hours for their opponents to
complete their rounds. By that time
the course had become even worse.
The greens turned to duck ponds
with lies having to be moved within
two yards of the cup.

Individually for the Bison,
Don Hansen °94 and Glenn
Hertzberg 94 led the way with two

round totals of 165 and 166 respec-
tively. Dave Fries ’93, Doug
Dollenberg ’94 and Captain Michael
Smigic ’92 all broke 180 to keep
Bucknell 12 strokes ahead of fifth-
place Lafayette.

Fordham and Holy Cross
should have saved hotel costs and
stayed home. They both finished

over 50 strokes off the pace.

In an anti-climactic season fi-
nale, the Bison traveled to the
Susquehanna Valley Country Club
for the Susquchanna Tournament.
Without Smigic, Bucknell managed
to finish second, five suokes behind
the host Crusaders. Hertzberg shot a

The Bucknell baseball squad
may want to consider wearing pin-

week, causing them to look more

ing force behind this stretch in
which Bucknell has won nine
straight games, including 13 of its
last 15. In the past week the
stickmen have scored 63 runs in
six games. Roger Ahrens ’91 hit
.560 (14-25) this week with four
home runs, 14 RBS, and 12 runs
scored—not a bad year for some
guys. Ahrens has raised his sea-
son average to .397, and he now
has seven round-trippers and 39
RBI. His slugging percentage is a
Ruthian .706. Dave Koemer ’92
is also sizzling. He has hit .458
(11-24) with three homers, 11
RBI, and 12 runs scored since tak-
ing over at shortstop for the in-
jured Bill Rinker ’92.

Bucknell started the week in
Hamilton, New York with a three-
game series against Colgate. In
the first game of Saturday’s
doubleheader, the Bison jumped
out to a 5-0 lead before cruising
to a 10-5 win. Koerner, Ahrens,
and Mark Kennedy ’92 has two
hits apiece to lead the offense,
while Koerner’s home run and
Ahrens’ triple were the big blows.
Mike Rizzi ’91 pitched six innings
for the win, improving his record
to 5-2.

In the nightcap, Kurt
Waldner ’93 went all the way, giv-
ing up only two runs in raising his
record to 4-1. The 5-2 win was
Walkner’s fourth complete game
of the year—tops on the staff.
Steve Gyimesi ’93 has two hits
and two RBI, while Koerner and
Ahrens each had RBI doubles.

Sexual assault policy to be
implemented fall semester

Plan to call for new hearing board,

By David Murray
Staff Writer

Pending final approval by
President Gary Sojka, a new policy
on campus sexual assault will be
implemented by the time students
return in the fall. The plan con-
cretely defines sexual assault, calls
for the creation of a specially trained
sexual assault hearing board to adju-
dicate such cases, and clearly speci-
fies the rights of both the victim and
the accused.

The policy is a revised version
of a draft originally written by Janice
Butler, director of the women’s re-
source center, and Arlyne Hoyt, di-
rector of psychological services,
who co-chair the committee on re-
spect and equality (CRE). Their
original version was submitted to the
committee on complimentary activi-

ties (CCA) for review.

Rick Gatteau, chair of CCA,
calls the review process “very time
consuming because we’re creating a
whole new policy.” CCA completed
its penultimate draft of the policy on
April 4, and has received comments
on it from the campus community.
“We’re working now to finish our
final draft,” he said. “We're hope-
fully going to act on it by the end of
the semester.”

Once completed, that draft
will be presented to Sojka for ap-
proval. “Since it’s only an interim
policy, he will probably just imple-
mentit, in consultation with others,”
predicted Charlotte Weddle, associ-
ate vice president for student life.

Eventually, the policy will be
incorporated into the findings of the
committee to review conduct regu-
lations (CRCR), which Weddle

Janice Butler, director of the Women’s Resource Center, was the
primary author of a sexual assault policy, now under review by the
committee on complimentary activities.

prompt action

chaired. CRCR’s report, submitted
in August 1990, suggested major
modifications to the University’s
present discipline system, including
sexual assault cases. Because of the
magnitude of CRCR’s suggestions,
however, its implementation may
take a year or more.

Butler approached Weddle in
December 1990 with, as Weddle re-
members, the concern that “victims
of sexual assault shouldn’t have to
wait a year” for the protection a tan-
gible sexual assault policy would
provide. After reviewing both
CRCR’s report and Butler and
Hoyt’s draft policy, Sojka asked
CCA to determine whether an in-
terim policy should be adopted.

CCA agreed that a sexual as-
sault policy should be put in place
before the larger CRCR proposal
goes into effect. CCA began work-
ing with Butler and Hoyt’s draft in
an attempt to finalize it as soon as
possible.

The penultimate draft defines
sexual assault as “deliberate physi-
cal contact of a sexual nature which
is against one’s will or without con-
sent.” It also advocates several ma-
jor changes to University policy.
First, a sexual assault hearing board,
separate from the current 12 mem-
ber committee on student conduct, is
to be created to adjudicate cases of
alleged sexual assault.

The new board will consist of
a male and female student, a male
and female faculty member, and one
administrator. According to the
draft, all five members will receive
special training in “characteristics of
Tape trauma syndrome, myths and
facts about sexual assault..., and ap-
propriate rules of evidence.” Hoyt
agreed that board members should
have a “heightened sensitivity to vic-
tims’ reactions.”

The small size of the board is
also designed “to reduce concerns
over confidentiality and the intimi-
dating nature of a larger group,” ac-
cording to a memorandum written
by Butler.

May 3, 1991

plan slated for 1992-93

By Tara Gilligan
Staff Writer

Pending approval by President
Sojka, the University will be adopt-
ing a four-year residency require-
ment which will go into effect for the
1992-93 school year. According to
John Dunlop, dean of students, the
new policy is both a “fiscal and po-
litical” attempt by the University to
keep all of its current housing filled
to capacity and to prevent students
who have been disciplinary prob-
lems from living in town.

The policy, written by mem-
bers of Trustee Implementation
Planning (TIP), was part of a seven-
teen-point recommendation for so-
cial changes which Sojka delivered
to the Trustees last year. A commit-
tee of students, administrators, and
townspeople drafted the final pro-
posal. “There was a lot of pressure
and a lot of concern from people
who live in student areas,” said Steve
Hoerter, co-chair of the TIP four-
year residency requirement commit-
tee.

For fiscal reasons, the Univer-
sity needs to maintain full-capacity
housing in its residence halls. In a
time of changing student demo
graphics across the nation, the Uni-
versity is taking precautionary mea-
sures to ensure that even if enroll-
ment drops in coming years, it will
be able to fill all of its present resi-
dence halls. Gerry Commerford, as-
sistant dean for housing, said that the
University wishes to maintain
“maximum income for the benefit of
all students.” The University de-
pends on revenue raised by student
room rentals. Empty rooms could be
financially burdensome.

The University once required
students to live on campus for all
four years, but removed the require-
ment more than two decades ago as

the number of students began to ex-
ceed the number of rooms available
on campus. As student enrollment
continued to rise, the University
built additional housing. Presently,
two residence areas, the Gateways
and Smith Hall, are still being paid
for out of room rentals, increasing
the need to continually fill all rooms.
“Tt could well be that our enrollment
will decline gradually or sharply
within the next few years... To pro-
tect ourselves from financial diffi-
culty we want to put in the require-
ment again,” said Dunlop.

Under the policy, a special ad-
ministrative committee will review
the disciplinary records of all stu-
dents who apply to live off campus.

After the review, students will be
subjected to a lottery system, similar
to the lottery system used for on-
campus housing, to determine who
will be eligible to live off campus.
The committee will review students’
discipline records and “serve as a
petitioning body” to hear appeals,
said Commerford.

The discipline review commit-
tee will decide at a later point exactly
what types of disciplinary offenses
will be severe enough to make an in-
dividual ineligible to live off cam-
pus. But for the first year at least, the
committee will look at each appli-
cant on a case by case basis. “We

STEP helps diversify Bucknell

By Elizabeth Danneberg
Staff Writer

Bucknell is one of five univer-
sities nationwide to host a Summer
Transfer Enrichment Program
(STEP). The STEP program gives
inner-city community college stu-
dents a chance to attend a four-year
college when they ordinarily would
not be able to do so, due to their fi-
nancial situation. “We can experi-
ence something which would ordi-
narily be out of reach... It gives us
confidence in our abilities,” says
Saabirah Warthen ’94, one of the ten
students who have been given this
opportunity in the STEP program.

The program, which began at
the end of June 1990, extracted 25
students from the Community Col-
lege of Philadelphia (CCP) to attend
a six-week term of classes. The stu-
dents could choose two out of three
combination classes: math and en-
gineering, computers and environ-
mental science, and English and psy-
chology. These courses were taught
by a Bucknell professor and a CCP
professor. Housing in Swartz hall
was provided for the STEP students,
which, adds Warthen, “was a nice
change from commuting in Philadel-
phia.”

The summer term was so en-
couraging for these students that ten
of them have decided to continue
pursuing Bachelor degrees at Buck-
nell. Susan Zingale, who served as
STEP program coordinator, com-
ments that this was “shocking and
thrilling at the same time.” Zingale
and Associate Professor Richard
Smith of the English department, the
latter who served as faculty coordi-
nator, helped put the program to-
gether under the direction of Tom
Greaves vice president of academic
affairs. The program will be offered
this summer as well, with Judith
Becker serving as chief administra-
tor in place of Greaves.

don’t want to come out with a list
just arbitrarily because not all mis-
behavior is equal,” Dunlop said. The
committee, he suggested, might look
at patterns of misconduct

“This is a case where subjec-
tivity is better than cut and dried,”
he said.

Bucknell’s decision to review
students’ conduct is virtually un-
precedented; only Brown University
has a similar policy. “It is an attempt
to affect behavior positively in the
community. People who we think
are too risky to live down there har-
moniously, responsibly, success-
fully, we'll keep them on the here on
the campus,” said Dunlop.

Thus far, all of the students
“have been doing very well and have
established their support groups,”
says Zingale.

According to Warthen, the
program “‘is a way to bridge gaps and
dispel a lot of the stereotypes many
people believe that the poor are not
smart enough to do better. If they

Second, the CCA draft sets
forth a condensed time table for the
adjudication of sexual assault cases.
Accountability in each case must be
determined within 10 days of the
original complaint. The swiftness of
the system is designed both to better
serve the alleged victim and to insure
the safety of the campus community.
Alacrity also dictates that the new
policy eliminate the preliminary in-
vestigating committee and its report,
both of which are usually required in
University disciplinary cases.

Finally; the policy spells out

= specific rights granted to both vic-
tims and alleged sexual assailants.
Both parties are assured of the assis-
tance of an adviser, the right to de-
cline to answer self-incriminating
questions, the availability of an ap-

Dunlop did say, however, that
few students will be affected. “Not
enough students are that bad,” he
said. Of the nearly 400 students who
will live off-campus not more than
about a half dozen have had serious
conduct problems, he said.

In general, the policy will have
little effect on current students,
Commerford predicts. Because stu-
dent demographics have not pro-
duced the decreasing enrollment
other schools have faced, most stu-
dents wishing to live off campus will
be able to. “For the next few years I
think the outcome will be that almost
everyone who wants to live off cam-
pus will be able to,” said Hoerter.

The TIP proposal has, for the
most part, received commendation

are given the right situation, they
may flourish.” STEP not only in-
stills optimism in these disadvan-
taged inner-city students, many of

whom are single parents as well, but -

it also helps to diversify Bucknell’s
campus.

The STEP program students
from CCP were selected on the basis
of several criteria.

The students must have com-

peal, and complete confidentiality,
among other things.

Indeed, Weddle believes that
the policy’s “great strength is its bal-
anced approach. It lets students
come forward knowing that they will
be treated in a prompt, fair, and sen-
sitive manner.” Butler agrees that
the policy is useless if victims don’t
step forward. “I welcome any
change that makes the system more
accessible to sexual assault victims,”
she said. Weddle concluded “[we
must] provide a responsive system
that’s balanced with one that’s fair.”

After CCA issued its penul-
timate draft, both Butler and Weddle
send memoranda highlighting some
questions they had with the policy.
“Mostly they’re clarifying main
points,” said Gatteau, “but there are
other points we’re still discussing.”
Once CCA issues its final draft to

from Lewisburg residents. Jacquie
Stiefel, a resident who served on the
TIP committee, feels the require-
ment will help students and towns-
people “to live with one another.”
She spoke of residents’ complaints
that college students do not ad-
equately care for property. “It’s not
fair of the students not to take care
of the property where they live,” she
said, hoping that the new policy will
alleviate some of the Property de-
struction.

According to Dunlop, though
no new reduction in the number of
students living off campus is likely
to take place for some years, “Stu-
dents will know that behavior is now
a factor in being able to live off cam-
pus.”

pleted two years of community col-
lege, and compete well academi-
cally, yet the program primarily
wanted those for whom a four-year
college would be an impossibility
due to a lack of financial resources.
Students were required to interview,
write papers about themselves and
provide two professor recommenda-
tions in order to apply for the STEP
program.

Sojka, however, parties unhappy
with the policy must address their
concerns directly to him. “Gary’s
going to have to make the deci-
sions,” said Butler.

She continued, “There are
some things that I would like to see
in the CCA draft, but I believe
CCA’s version is better than what
we have now.” Weddle agreed, say-
ing “I think we’re all moving in the
same direction. I think those details
don’t warrant a long-term delay.”

Once CCA is finished with the
interim sexual assault policy, it will
turn its attention back to the CRCR
report in hopes of revamping the en-
tire University conduct and disci-
pline code by 1992.

You can get the facts.

Other community members,
though agreeing with the policy,
raised certain concerns. “We do
question a section [of the TIP pro-
posal] concerning students who own
or whose parents own property as
being exempt from the lottery,”
David Broadt, president of the Bor-
ough of Lewisburg, wrote in a letter
to Sojka.

Broadt’s concern was that stu-
dents could bypass the University
lottery by simply living off campus
with friends who own property.

Most members of the Borough
Council support the proposal. Broadt
Pointed out, however, that “those
that live in the neighborhoods that
have the most problems feel that it
doesn’t go far enough.”

James Lee, a member of the
Borough Council, raised concerns
over the number of students who will
Still be allowed to live in town, even
with the proposed restrictions. “One
of the real disappointments I had in
talking to Bucknell was about reduc-
ing the number of students living in
town,” he said.

Rather than a reduction in off-
campus housing, Lee sees an “‘in-
creased number of single family
houses that are being bought by stu-
dents or students’ parents.”

“When students live in great
numbers in the community it dis-
rupts the community,” he said,
pointing to problems with property
maintenance, parking, congestion
and noise. Nonetheless, Lee said he
does support the proposal.

Racial overtones
mar student clash

By Andrew Cohen
and Mark Abrahamsen
Staff Writers

An altercation with racial
overtones has led to charges within
the University against Colin Barker
*94, according to Dave Betsill °94.
The incident occurred early Sunday
morning between Edwards House
and Vedder Hall on Sixth Street.

Barker was contacted by The
Bucknellian and declined to com-
ment. Betsill, who filed the com-
plaint, explained that he was walk-
ing toward Edwards House from the
freshman quad and saw two indi-
viduals walking toward Smith Hall
from Edwards House. One of them,
whom Betsill identified as Barker,
“was spitting at first repetitiously,
sort of at me, and when I turned
around I saw him looking at me,”
said Betsill. “I didn’t say anything to

him, I kept walking and he said
“Yeah, that’s what I thought, just
keep walking.’”

Betsill and Barker then began
exchanging words and, according to
Betsill, Barker said, “How did you
get in to this school?” Later, “I heard
him say ‘you black...’ something,
but I didn’t hear what he said be-
cause I was too busy screaming back
at him,” said Betsill.

At this point, several of
Betsill’s friends from Edwards
House came outside and joined him.
“They walked up in [Barker’s] face,”
said Betsill, at which point “[Barker]
said ‘I’ll take my boy on one-on-
one,’ and he pushed me and that’s
when my friends jumped in.” Betsill

Be nice—

injured his knee trying to break up
the incident between his friends and
Barker.

After the fight was broken up,
Betsill filed a report with both the
University and East Buffalo Town-
ship Police. Sid Jamieson, coach of
the lacrosse team for which Barker
was the starting goalie, was notified
about the incident. As a conse-
quence, Jamieson suspended Barker
from play for the remainder of the
lacrosse season after “we had a con-
versation with him about his behav-
ior, during which time he indicated
that he was inebriated and had got-
ten into a conflict with other stu-
dents,” noted Jamieson.

Jamieson stressed that the sus-
pension was not due to the potential
racial character of the incident, and
said, “It would not be appropriate to
comment on something that we just
were not a party to.”

Although Barker’s suspension
from the lacrosse team did not result
from the charges of racial harass-
ment, he is not finished with the Uni-
versity disciplinary system. John
Dunlop, dean of students, declined
to comment on the incident, but he
did mention that the situation was
being investigated.

Timothy Clark, director of mi-
nority student development and as-
sistant coach of the lacrosse team, is
helping Betsill with his complaint.
He declined to comment on the de-
tails of the case, because, “It would

really mess up the judicial process if
I got into the specifics of what hap-
pened. I’ve only heard hearsay and
I’m not in a position to judge.”

we must accept. The fraternities still
feel it is their obligation to provide
the alcohol, but come next semester
that has to change.”

Jason Besz, social chairman
for Theta Chi, says student turnout
this weekend confirmed campus
sentiments of dissatisfaction with the
policy. “There was basically no sup-
port for the weekend,” stated Besz.
“Turnout at the uphill houses was
extremely low, in some cases in the
single digits.”

Director of Security and
Safety Vince DeCerchio says the
blame cannot fall entirely onto the
shoulders of Bucknell fraternities or
the IFC.

fusion among the fraternities as to
how BYOB should work,” noted
DeCerchio. “Most parties were ei-

retirement plans

By Darren Millman
Staff Writer

George Jenks, collection de-
velopment librarian, better known as
the man who proposed the motions
to abolish both Bucknell’s Greek
system and the campus’ Reserve Of-
ficer Training Corps (ROTC) pro-
gram, has announced his intention to
retire from his position at the end of
the school year.

Jenks expressed excitement
about his decision saying, “Early re-
tirement is a good deal at Bucknell.”

President Sojka notified the
faculty of Jenks’ retirement along
with the retirements of six other Uni-
versity employees in a memo sent
earlier this week.

Despite his leadership role in
the faculty motions involving the
Greek system and the ROTC pro-
gram, Jenks explained that the ac-
complishments he is most proud of

are “ones which deal- with the li-
brary, although most people don’t

see them.”

While the faculty passed
Jenks’ motion to abolish the Greek
system, his attempt earlier this se-
mester to eliminate the ROTC pro-
gram was defeated. Referring to the
ROTC motion, Jenks commented,
“It’s always disappointing when you
lose.”

Jenks expressed his concern
over the current state of affairs at
Bucknell. “I don’t feel the Univer-
sity is heading in a good direction,
but I don’t think it is just Bucknell,
but nationwide at colleges and uni-

versities. I see growing
vocationalism among students, and
growing hierarchy among university
administrations.”

Jenks’ wife Zoya will remain
in her role as catalog librarian next
semester. Although he admitted that
he did not have definite plans for the
immediate future, Jenks indicated
that he would like to do more work

with libraries.

Correction

In last week’s Features section, an employee of the Physical Plant
was incorrectly identified as George Trepp. His correct name is George
Trutt. The Bucknellian regrets the error.

ther very quiet or non-existent. The
confusion is clearly due to the fact
that the national fraternity organiza-
tions passed the responsibility on to
the local chapters and the University
without giving a workable plan for
BYOB.”

The BYOB policy is mandated
by the insurance liabilities which
exist for the national fraternities, yet
there has been little if any national
participation in the BYOB policy at
Bucknell.

“This is anew policy for many
fraternities on campus,” said Besz.
“You can’t expect to make an execu-
tive decision at the top and have all
the details and changes be imple-
mented at the grass-roots level.”

DeCerchio finds the policy
also raises fears concerning con-
sumption in alternate locations.

“BYOB could result in increased
drinking in the dormitories and the
apartments in town, as well as possi-
bly resulting in more drinking of
hard liquor,” he said.

Though the weekend was not
an overwhelming success, it did
serve its purpose as a “trial” period.
“I’m not real happy with the BYOB
concept at this point,” said
DeCerchio, “but the jury’s still out.
This summer I hope to work with
Student Life and some of the local
chapters to improve the situation be-
fore next fall.”

Maguire stated, “There is
some major work to be done by the
fraternities. Each house needs to be
able to trust that the other fraterni-
ties are also following the guidelines
of the BYOB policy. That is a big
step, but not an impossible one.”

Damage to Ku-
waiti oil fields

The fires which Saddam
Hussein’s retreating army set in oil
fields in Kuwait are not only burning
millions of dollars an hour, but are
also destroying the natural balance
of the fields themselves

Officials now say that al-
though the fires may be extin-
guished, the damage will cost Ku-
wait far more than it can stand to
lose; for even if they can make the
oil rise to the surface, it will be of
lower quality than it was previously,
thereby causing a decline in its
value.

The natural gas which once
pumped the oil is being burned
away, along with other natural fea-
tures miles below the Kuwaiti desert.

Although the oil fields were
once predicted to have a life of 100-
years, experts now express alarm
due to the possibility of that figure
dropping by as much as a third.

Kuwaiti fire fighters are bat-
tling the flames, but they lack the
equipment to effectively stop the
blaze. Says James Plack, a consult-
ant with Cambridge Energy Re-
search Associates, “The slow pace
(of the fire fighting] is disheartening
to watch.”

Cyclone hits
Bangladesh

Millions of people were left
homeless and at least 1,000 people
were killed as a powerful cyclone
pounded Bangladesh for more than
eight hours. Five thousand fisher-
men alone were reported missing.

Bangladesh is among the
world’s poorest and most densely
populated nations. Thus, many
people of this low-lying tropical
country must inhabit the coastal area
and islands that are so frequently
prone to floods and other natural ca-
lamities.

The storm has caused nearly
$1 billion in damage and battered 14
southeastern coastal regions. The
storm had winds up to 14 m.p.h. and
brought waves 20 feet high, uproot-
ing trees, telephone lines, and elec-
tricity poles. Prime Minister
Khaleda Zia called an emergency
meeting of her Cabinet to discuss re-
lief measures and appeal for interna-
tional help.

Members of the United Na-
tions Security Council are trying to
reach agreement on creating a
United Nations police force in

northern Iraq to replace Americans -

Sexual miscon-
duct suit at CMU

Patricia Tanner, a 22-year
employee at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity, filed a lawsuit against Rich-
ard M. Cyert, former president of the
institution.

Tanner alleged that on August
19, 1972, President Cyert made
sexual advances toward her, result-
ing in a forced escape by Tanner.
She asserted that Cyert later at-
tempted to remove her from her po-
sition as financial administrator and
financial assistant to the president,
deciding not to fire her only after she
received legal advise and her lawyer
discussed the situation with Cyert.

From that point, Tanner said
that she was given very little “real”
work to do, and that, when she was
asked to leave in 1988, it was be-
cause of the 1972 even with Cyert.

Last September, the suit was
settle out of court for an undisclosed
amount, but CMU officials stated

The idea of a police force,
rather than a full-pledged peace-
keeping force, in Iraq would prevent
new debate on whether intervention
in Iraq’s affairs can be authorized
without a request from the Baghdad
Government and would provide
protection for the Kurds.

U.N. peacekeeping forces
consist of uniformed soldiers from
military units of member countries.
The have automatic weapons, ar-
mored vehicles, and artillery. The
U.N. police are drawn from civilian
forces, carry sidearms, and wear arm
bands.

American forces would not be
immediately involved if such a po-
lice force is established. This would
clear the predicament for the United
States of having to leave large num-
bers of American troops committed
to Northem Iraq.

NATIONAL

Federal Interest
Rates cut

The Federal Reserve has low-
ered the discount rate, the rate it
charges on loans to banks, to 5.5
percent from 6 percent to try to end
the recession. Central banks also
have pushed down important Fed-
eral Funds rate, the rate banks charge
each other on loans, to 5.75 percent
from 6 percent.

Both of these rates affect what
banks pay for deposits and other
funds, and what they can then charge
when they lend out this money.

The cut was made because the
Federal Reserve, as well as the credit
markets, felt that recent data showed
that the economy was still very
weak. Some policy makers have
asked questions, but none reportedly

CAMPUS

that they merely decided the lawsuit
was Causing too many problems
within the administration. They also
added that they felt Tanner’s allega-
tions were unsubstantiated, but they
would not pursue the suit further.

College appli-
cations decline

Applications are down, says
the Department of Education, as the
Post-Baby Boom Era is nearly at its
end. Most public and private
schools have felt the drop of incom-
ing students, some by nearly 15
percent.

In 1991, there will be only 2.5
million high school graduates,
200,000 less than 1990. Those re-
searching the decline say the num-
bers should continue to drop until
1994. Locally, Susquehanna Uni-
versity has already experienced a
lower number of applications for in-

coming freshmen, but officials at the
institution say that they will not
lower their acceptance levels, as they
want to maintain the quality of their
students regardless of the quantity.

Students fight
for Fla. Bottle Bill

Students from Florida State
University, the University of South
Florida, and Florida International
University, are merely a few of the
campuses involved in the Florida
Public Interest Research Group’s
(PIRG) drive to implement a Bottle
bill in Florida.

This Bill would place a five-
cent deposit on cans and bottles sold
in the state, in the hopes that recy-
cling will increase.

The main problem that PIRG
faces is trying to receive the agree-
ment of the retail and beverage in-
dustries. Says Mike Brustad, Florida

objected to the Federal Funds rate
cut.

Economic rac-
ism sweeps U.S.

Blacks of all ages, regions, and
economic levels are telling similar
stories of bad service, public hu-
miliation, and legal harassment
when confronted by representatives
of service industries. The blacks feel
that these people do not acknowl-
edge blacks’ growing economic
power, private resources, and buying
patterns.

The result of “economic rac-
ism,” in which money and social
status are used as barriers for dis-
crimination, has caused an increas-
ing impatience and rage among

PIRG’s organizing director, “they
just don’t want to be told they have
to recycle.”

Similar Bottle Bills are now
enforced in nine states. —NSNS

Graves found
at Gettysburg

At Gettysburg College, an ar-
chaeological find has been unearthed
beneath the Ice House apartment
site. While renovations were taking
place, four graves were discovered
under the parking lot. Officials were
not surprised, as the land had be-
longed to a Presbyterian Church and
adjacent graveyard in the 1780's;
however, they had been informed
that all the graves had been removed
in 1866. Due to this new find, reno-
vations have temporarily been
ceased, as archaeologists are plan-
ning excavations in an attempt to
unearth other possible graves.

many middle-class blacks. This new,
more subtle, form of racism is de-
priving them of their rights as citi-
zens of the United States. Further-
more, blacks are still being discrimi-
nated against because of stereotypes
still existing from the past.
Although other racial and eth-
nic groups and women are targets of
discrimination in public places also,
blacks believe that they feel the bur-
den of such discrimination more
than any other group because their
color sets them apart immediately.

Fear rises due to
incinerators

One portion of the army, $200
billion project to prevent the spread
of poisons and clear up its contami-
nated bases and munitions factories
is falling years behind in schedule,
experiencing huge cost increases,
and causing public protests
throughout six states and the South
pacific.

The Army’s program to incin-
erate enormous piles of waste and
deadly weapons of the cold war is
being plagued also by flaws in de-
sign and operation. The proposed
burning of such material is in agree-
ment with a treaty signed last June
with the Soviet Union to burn all
mustard gas and nerve agents. This
60 to 70 million pounds of the
world’s deadliest chemicals are to be
bumed in nine incinerators, eight of
which are to be built at military bases
in the United States.

Incineration is believed to be
more reliable and safer than any
other technology, and the risk of an
accident during incineration is
smaller than if these chemicals were
left unattended. However, residents
of these proposed incinerator sights
are fearful of their creation. Resi-
dents from Arkansas, Colorado, In-
diana, Kentucky, Maryland, Oregon,
and Johnston Atoll in the South Pa-
cific feel that incinerators are areas
of potential problems and a threat to
a way of life. Only Alabama and
Utah have showed overwhelming
support for the incinerators.

Dance Co. to present spring show |American Film
musical succeeds

By Ashley Shrader
Staff Writer

The Bucknell Dance Com-
pany will combine the skills of stu-
dents, faculty, guest artists, and
alumni to present a lively and enter-
taining spring concert next Friday
and Saturday.

Highlighting the concert will
be “Totem,” choreographed by As-
sistant Director of Dance Danna
Frangione and Todd Rosenleib ’89.
The piece, created during the “Roel
Intensive ’91” January program, uti-
lizes post-modern Brazilian music
by Uakti to celebrate the themes of
ritual possession and death. The

Concert.

work features guest artist Peter Roel,
principal dancer with New York’s
Elisa Monte Company, and Todd
Rosenleib, M.F.A. Dance candidate
at New York University, as tribal
demons and Tina Henninger ’91 and
Sharon Nichols ’91 as the possessed
celebrants. Mask designs by Associ-
ate Professor of Theatre F. Elaine
Williams and lighting by Steven
Draheim help lend an eerie quality
to this primitive work.

Guest artist Roel choreo-
graphed “Ajar” during this same
January Dance Intensive. The
work’s musical score, created and
performed by saxophonist Marcel
Van Rootselaar and cellist Michelle
Kinney, was commissioned espe-
cially for Roel by the Dance Com-
pany. The abstract modem piece,
featuring Rosenlieb and six female
dancers, creates images of positive
and negative space with the dancers’
bodies.

Assistant Professor of Dance
Shellie Cash-Muller will premier a
classical ballet about joy and spring-
time. “They, too, a dream are pursu-
ing” is a dance which presents pure
movement for movement’s sake.
The musical score consists of two
arias, “Stridono Lassu” from /
Pagliacci and “Ah! Je Ris de Me
Voir Si Belle” from Faust, sung by
Assistant Professor of Music
Catherine Payn and accompanied by
pianist Assistant Professor of Music
William Payn.

New student choreography in-
cludes Henninger’s “Faunus.” The
modem piece, performed by a quar-
tet of dancers, uses a collage of flute
music to create an impressionistic
picture of wind and trees.

The high powered jazz num-
ber “Temptation,” choreographed by
Nichols and danced to the erotic
rock-n-roll music of Prince, is a mu-

sical video take-off combining sen-
suous and energetic movements to

create a playful, sexual encounter.

Amy Kantor ’94 makes her
choreographic debut with “Tapes-
try,” a creative and complex work
which varies in tempo and mood. Its
spiritual prelude of bells and
Gregorian chants offers a shocking
contrast to the fast-paced, energetic
music which is to follow.

Jennifer Barlow °91 and
Megen Karakelian ’93 join choreo-
graphic talents in the presentation of
“You Give Me...,” a 1940’s style
jazz piece full of energetic and sub-
tly sexy dance combinations. The
work incorporates three pieces of
music and features vocal soloist Jen-
nifer Wagman ’92 singing the cool
yet intensely heated “Fever.”

The concert also showcases
the lighting designs of Department
of Theater and Dance Lighting/
Technical Director Steven Draheim
and the set and costume design of
Director of Theatre F, Elaine Wil-
liams. Tickets are on sale now in the

The musical comedy A His-
tory of the American Film, brought
to Bucknell’s stage by the depart-
ment of theatre and dance, de-
lighted and entertained audiences
during Parents’ Weekend.

The play was a fun and un-
usual blend of serious cinematic
history from its earliest beginnings,
and satirical humor. Tied into a se-
ries of scenes enveloping all of the
classic film genres into short skits
were the charming characters of
Loretta, Jimmy, Bette, and Eve
who spoofed the American ideals
of the Big Screen.

Performances by Valerie
Marsden ’93, Andrew Garman ’92,
and Penelope Kokines ’91 stood
out as they brought life to movie
stereotypes of cowboys, gangsters,
showgirls, and war heroes. A par-
ticular crowd pleaser was a “Salad”

chorus number in which characters
were adorned with various veg-
etables and sang of the virtues of
salad with full sincerity.

The play took familiar
scenes from movies past and em-
phasized the stereotypical roles of
the black southern maid, the rich
and flighty heiress, the escaped
convict, the simple country folk,
and the insane alcoholic. They led
the audience through the war and
the communist interrogations, all
with the backdrop of the movie the-
atre and the fans who flocked to its
seats to get lost in its fantasy.

The play was cleverly done,
complete with a “The End” sign
lowering after every scene to close
each story. In the final scene, the
“The End” sign crumbled and
came crashing down. Symbolic? In
any case, the play was an entertain-
ing success, well-deserved by the
talented ensemble that brought it to
life.

Checking out the local grocery
stores: Gicam# squashes Weis

By Sue Basalla
and David Murray
Staff Writers

Annoyed by long lines and
high prices at Weis markets, two re-
porters from The Bucknellian de-
cided to investigate other less-fre-
quented stores in search of a better
shopping experience.

We toured three local super-
markets (Weis Markets, Acme
Supersaver and Giant Supermarket)
to compare the prices and services of
each store. The prices for items on a
randomly assembled list (see
sidebar) proved that Giant was
roughly 15% cheaper than the other
stores. Following are some of the
authors’ personal reactions to each
store:

Giant: The Clear Winner

The Giant grocery store in
Northumberland (across from
Tedd’s Landing) was cleaner, better
stocked and had more variety than
any of the other stores we visited.
The produce section was lush and
green and the bakery and deli were
attractively arranged (not to mention
the free samples). The staff we en-
countered, manager Tom Woodring
and baker Alice Kline, answered our
questions cheerfully.

Giant offers many special cus-
tomer services: shallow yet spacious
carts equipped with child safety
seats, a frozen yogurt machine, $.03

rentals ($.99 if not a new release),
and a whole health and beauty sec-

basket of groceries cost $12.92 more
at Acme and $11.58 more at Weis.

Two problems with shopping
at this otherwise wonderful store are
the lack of both a salad bar and a
nearby MAC machine. Also, the
drive to Giant is about ten minutes
from campus, but definitely worth
the trip considering the low prices
and the wide variety! Plus, you can

Weis: The Old Favorite
Reconsidered

Being close to campus and an
alternative social spot for Bucknell-
ians and Lewisburgers in general,
Weis on Route 15 has enjoyed great
popularity, especially on Friday af-
ternoons when the check-out lines
block the cereal aisle. Although
prices are far higher at Weis than at
Giant, the Big Top and Weis Quality
brands help bring down your grocery
bill. The new and extremely conve-
nient pay-with-your-MAC-at-the-
register policy eliminates the anxiety
of trying to add up your groceries
before check out. For those of you
into collecting S&H Green Stamps,
Weis is the only store of the three to
offer these potential purchasing
points.

After visiting Giant, however,
Weis’s produce looked tired and the
bakery items seemed less attractive
(maybe it was just the late ’60s de-
cor...). The variety and quantity of
items on the shelves also seemed to
be lacking in comparison to Giant.
As for customer service, we ap-

locate it, however, there was no one
working there. The customer service
desk was also deserted—we waited
at the desk for five minutes and then
gave up, having never been noticed.

Acme’s prices are lower than
Weis’, for the most part, and the
shelves are generally well-stocked.
This abundance of items is hardly
surprising, though, since the store is
not exactly bustling with customers.

Senior soars the skies of Selinsgrove

Jeff Lee ‘91 began flying to overcome fear of small planes

By Cindy Levinson
Staff Writer

For some people, the thought
of flying a plane never occurs to
them until their college years when
they begin to broaden their horizons.
But for Jeff Lee ’91, “flying” has
been a household word for as long
as he can remember. Jeff has only
been flying for a year and a half, but
his father flew for Eastern Airlines
for over 20 years, and his brother Jim
Lee ’90 is currently working as a
flight instructor.

Jeff's father tried to spark an
interest in flying when Jeff was
about 16, but the flying bug just was
not in him. At that point in time, Jeff
did not have confidence in himself
that he would be able to get his
pilot’s license.

It was not until his sophomore
year at Bucknell that Jeff took a sec-
ond look at the opportunity to learn
to fly. At that time, Jeff had decided
to take flying lessons to overcome
his fear of small planes. After a few
lessons, Lee realized that he wanted
to go on to get his license. So, during
the summer following his sopho-
more year, Lee spent five intense
weeks getting his license. Lee said
his father was both supportive and
helpful throughout the entire pro-
cess.

His dad’s interest in Lee’s fly-
ing continued beyond just getting the
license. Lee has: been fortunate
enough to have his father’s Piper
comanche here at Bucknell. The
Comanche is a four-person, 180-
horsepower plane with retractable
gear. Jeff has gained the majority of
his experience and logged in most of
his flying hours in this plane.

Lee keeps the Comanche in
Selinsgrove and flies it about once a
week. During the past year and a
half, these trips have taken him
around Lewisburg and as far as Nan-
tucket, Martha’s Vineyard, Hartford,
Albany, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh and even to State College

for an occasional dinner (flight time:
15 minutes).

Although he has been trained
to deal with emergencies, Lee has
had his share of frightening experi-
ences in-the air. On his first solo
flight, he had complete radio failure.
While on a night-time trip, Lee ex-
perienced alternator failure and
could have lost all navigational
power. Fortunately, Lee managed a
safe emergency landing at the next
airport. He credits his pilot training
with helping him control his panic in
these potentially disastrous situa-
tions.

Throughout it all, Lee has only
had to worry about the cost of gas.
All storage and maintenance costs
are covered by his father. Lee real-
izes that he will probably have to re-
turn his plane to his father upon

graduating from Bucknell because
he probably will not be able to af-
ford the fees

Since his time at Bucknell is
rapidly dwindling, he plans to get as
much use out of the plane in the next
month as he possibly can. Lee said,
“If you look up and hear a plane,
chances are, it’ll be me.”

Although Lee thoroughly en-
joys flying, he does not view it as
one of his top career choices. Lee
realizes that being a commercial pi-
lot for a large airline is not as glam-
orous as it appears. He views the
profession as similar to that of a “a
well-paid bus driver.” (This is not to
say that he does not respect the pro-
fession, however. His father enjoyed
working for Eastern and his brother
looks forward to sending his resume
to large airlines in the fall.) Lee sees

the career as being to dependent
upon others for his tastes. He is look-
ing for a job that would “afford [him]
the opportunity to write [his] future,
something you can’t do as a pilot.”
Lee also commented that he is
“not as keen on the joy of flight as
some people are... appreciate the
practical aspects of it...I hate to be
stuck in one spot.” Lee is more inter-
ested in experiencing a variety of
exciting sports, rather than concen-
trating upon one. He sees his hobbies
of flying, scuba diving, sailing, and
sky diving as “things you can do that
put a little interest in your life.”
Other “interesting” sports that Lee
would like to try his hand at are
bungee jumping and hang-gliding.
so if you have any of those “living
on the edge” hobbies and need a
partner, Lee is the one to call.

The Collegiate Perspective
(and other fairy tales...)

By Peter Lalos
Staff Writer

Student Requalification Exam:
Spring 1991 semester

Only a perfect score on this
examination will qualify students
for readmittance to the university
for the following year.

Testing time: 25 minutes

Number of questions: 6

1) The most vital social con-
cern facing Bucknellians during
the 1990-1991 school year was:

a) Trying to keep track of
what POWER, FAG, FLAG,
AHCHA, STOP, ROTC, and
BYOB stood for, both figuratively
and literally.

b) Morale problems due to
lack of available controvérsy on
campus.

c) Evading the draft.

d) Breaking in the new Bison
to give it that “lived in” look.

e) A healthy quantity of the
above, if taken in moderation.

2) The number “2” repre-
sents:

a) The number of seniors
who have been accepted for em-
ployment positions after their
graduation this year.

b) The number of students
who have the guts to openly admit
that they are card-holding members
of FAG.

c) The projected amount of
money (in dollars) that the univer-
sity hopes to receive from Greek
alumni over the next ten years.

d) The number of months
before STOP will realize that the
Gulf war is over, and give it a rest.

e) F, G, and M.

3) The sentiment most likely
not to be overheard on Bucknell’s
campus is which of the following?

a) “Oh, I don’t imagine Mr.
Jenks would object to the construc-
tion of the new R.O.T.C. barracks
behind the Bertrand Library.”

b) “Well, I for one don’t
mind spreading that gelatinous yel-
low stuff in the caf’s mayonnaise
bin on my BLT’s.”

c) “The great thing is, none
of my finals fall on the same day!”

d) “And if you win the tour-
nament, ladies, we'll play quarters
the whole bus ride home!”

e) “My schedule for next se-
mester? Did it in five minutes. No
problem.”

f) “What’s this grainy white
substance under my feet on the
sidewalk?”

4) The recent outbreak of
vandalism across campus is most
likely due to the fact that:

‘S

a) Everyone knows that the
benches in the academic quad are
more comfortable to sit in if
they’re upside-down.

b) The shoplifting ring in
the bookstore just didn’t fly like
people expected it to.

c) Everybody's running
around butt naked with BB guns
in California— They say it’s
gonna be bigger than foozball in
a couple of years, dude!

@Mit's...It's:. It's the
recession... There, I said it!
WE’RE IN A RECESSION,
OKAY?

e) All of the majority.

5) Those students found to
be chronically complaining about
life at Bucknell should take
which of the following courses of
action for best results?

a) Join the whining team,
which is to be sanctioned as a var-
sity sport here as of the 1991-
1992 school year.

b) Keep up the good work—
you’re making life so enjoyable
for the rest of us.

c) Take part in another spir-
ited activity for releasing pent-up
stress— like dodging traffic on
Route 15 with a blindfold on.

d) TRANSFER.

e) A, C, and...oh, what’s
the use? No one’s going to read
this, I can’t find a date for
formals, and my G.P.A. is drop-
ping like Kuwaiti oil stock. Life
stinks.

6) The university’s endow-
ment is characteristically weak
because:

a) Whenever we hold
fundraisers featuring former U.S.
presidents, riots seem to break
out.

b) Alumni support has been
linked to cancer.

c) Squirrels!

d) This nutty Disney-
Muppets controversy...1 think
that I can safely say that it’s
thrown us all for a bit of a loop.
What can you believe in these
days?

e) A smidgen of the hori-
zontal.

Extra Credit: Name the
Next site on campus that is due for
either renovation or construction
in the near future (This should be
a freebee for everyone, mainly
since any answer will inevitably
be correct).

When you have completed
this examination and tumed it in
to psychological services, you are
free to leave the campus for the
year. And HEY!-Be careful out

there.

speaking on diversity

“,.-The dream of racial amity—of blacks and whites learning and playing together—seems
sadly elusive,” reported Tom Morganthau in this week’s Newsweek article entitled “Race on
Campus: Failing the Test?”

The alleged racial harassment incident that occurred this Sunday is a clear reminder that
Bucknell suffers from the same race relation problems that Morganthau describes as afflicting
all American colleges and universities.

A recent incident at Brown University highlights the conflict between protecting the rights
of minorites on campus and protecting free speech. Brown’s administration expelled Douglas
Hann after the junior was found guilty of yelling anti-black, anti-Semitic, and anti-homosexual
epithets, his second violation of Brown’s anti-harassment rule. Brown’s definition of “harass-
ment” has infringed upon his rights of free speech. Indeed it is ironic that Brown’s administra-
tion is trying to respect the rights of minorites, but, in the same stroke, they are squelching
diversity of speech and thought.

Although students and other members of the campus community should have an overriding
right of expression, no matter how unpleasant that expression may be, harassing individuals is
beyond the scope of that right. Harassment is the persistent annoyance of an individual, not a

It would be a terrible mistake for Bucknell to use the Brown example as a precedent; the
administration must recognize the prima facie importance of free speech and diverse thought.
Yet at the same time assaults such as the one last weekend must not go unpunished...

While racially motivated incidents of violence are rare at Bucknell, no one could deny that
this campus is far from achieving racial harmony. The University must protect a student’s right
to speak freely even though it has no constitutional obligation to do so.

On the other hand, when actions are directed against a particular individual, it is clear that
the perpetrator has no place at any institution of higher education.

Diversity without tolerance and mutual respect will do little more than tear the campus
community apart. One would hope that racism, sexism, and homophobia will eventually lose out
in the market of ideas, but as Voltaire said, “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the
death your right to say it.”

Matt Meritt ’91 has introduced a BSG resolution which “urges the university to adopta free
speech code by which various forms of communication...are protected and are allowed to be
exercised regardless of their content.” It is time that Bucknell put its far-reaching commitment to
free speech in writing—now is not the time to mandate politically correct speech, as Brown has

LETIERS TO THE EDITOR

Editorial upsets reader

To the Editor:

While I have read a.number
of similar paeans to the “great
university” we call Bucknell in
the well-managed pages of public
relations publications, I would
not have expected to hear such
hollow rhetoric from the editorial
board of the Bucknellian. Surely
Travis Elliott and my peers know
that there is more to a university
than million dollar projects and
greek pacifism. Surely, to your
minds, there are a few other
things encom-
passed in
being a great
university.

AsI
said, I have
read such sad
words about
what consti-
tutes
Bucknell’s
greatness in
other publica-
tions and in
other forums. The one that I most
remember, though, was a press
guide to the 1990 Patriot League
football season. The folks at the
Patriot League had been decent
enough to allow each university a
page of space to talk about what
they were and what they valued.
Given this opportunity, Bucknell
used about 50 of its 300 or so
words to make a few perfunctory
remarks about teaching and, then,
went on to discuss at length
buildings and dollar figures.

This was indeed sad, I
thought, but perhaps to be ex-
pected from a nervous middle
class university that, like so many
of the students it attracts, all too
often confuses wealth and expen-
diture with quality. Yet, to see
this same gesture made by my

“I would not
have expected
to hear such
hollow rhetoric
from the edito-
rial board of the
Bucknellian.”

friends was disturbing.

Teaching, learning, com-
munity, a sense of common pur-
pose — these are the things, or
some of the things which make a
university truly great. Sadly for
administrators, parents, and some
students these things cannot be
quantified; unlike other aspects
of the university, they cannot be
put into an equation which will
calculate the greatness of this or
any institution. All the same, I
was sorry to see that they were
overlooked in your editorial.

Yet, as I have
thought since reading
April 26th’s essay, it
could be the case that
the editorial was an
extremely clever
attempt to point out
the inanity of an
institution which
thinks it can demon-
strated greatness by
pointing to its balance
sheet and to the accu-
mulation of bricks
and mortar. Perhaps the editorial
was also intended to show, by
means of deviously eliciting
positive reactions from visiting
parents, how so many of these
people are educational consum-
ers in the worst sense.

If this is the case, bravo to
the editorial board, I say. Then
indeed, it was a masterful essay.
But I might add that, if this was
the intent of your editorial, you
could leave a few more hints of
your irony, a few more sugges-
tions of your true purpose. Such
careless readers as myself need
help at times and, as we all
know, no one likes being left out
of a joke.

Student questions validity of
MG 101 and newspaper article

To the Editor:

Socrates may have been only
mortal, but he still gave out some
damn good advice. Take for ex-
ample, what he tells Hippocrates, a
budding young scholar, in the
Protagoras: “...something which
you value more highly than your
body, namely your soul — some-
thing on whose beneficial or harm-
ful treatment your whole welfare
depends...”

Sure, I just quoted Socrates,
and I happen to be a philosophy
major. While not knowing the
meaning of life, I do know a few
things about Bucknell life. A aes-
thetically beautiful school mired in
problems, but still a good place to
get an education. Maybe.

Bucknell has got its educa-
tional difficulties to work out, but it
certainly does not need The Buck-
nellian adding fuel to the prover-
bial fire. Which, is exactly what
your paper did on April 26 with
your larger than life feature on
Professor John Miller and Manage-
ment 101.

I have many problems with
you giving such heralded press to
this specific class. Primarily be-
cause MG101 just does not deserve
it. After reading last Friday’s fea-
ture page, some might think
MG101 should be a graduation
requirement. More realistically, the
two articles may have encouraged
someone to take the class. I find
this highly irresponsible writing
such high praises without any criti-
cal review of this class. Mainly
because through experience and
interaction with others, I have
heard more complaints about this

one class than any other. It is in this
spirit that I would like to describe
the problems with the class that
“Jeaves an impression.” Taking the
downside of MG101 into consider-
ation, it did not really warrant the
Bucknellian’s publicity.

As stated in Susan Smith’s
article, when John Miller started his
brainchild he “felt that all liberal arts
students, not just business majors
should be exposed to the basic of
management.” Yet MG101 is al-
ways loaded with BSBA wanna-
be’s. This is due to the obvious fact
that MG101 is a requirement for
admission into the business program
at Bucknell University. Now why is
MG101 a requirement for BSBA
applicants if the course was sup-
posed to be geared for liberal arts
students? Won’t these future busi-
ness students learn the basics of
management in the BSBA degree
requirements: Marketing, Financial
Accounting, Management Science,
Micro-Economic Theory, Finance,
etc? I guess pre-business majors
must be in the class for learning how
“emotionally engaging, how inter-
esting it is to work with other
people.” While this statement by
Professor Miller is absolutely true, I
really doubt if MG101 is the place
where Bucknellians learn to work
with other people. Yes, I was emo-
tionally engaged (as if I normally
am not) when I took the class. Yes,
there is more student interaction in
MG101 than most other classes.
Yes, a group of people accomplish
things, they could not do indepen-
dently. And finally Yes, the MG101
students manage in the literal sense

.— they getithings done through

people. However I feel that the only

reason people get things done, and
perhaps appear to be learning
about working with people, is
because there is a common desire
to do well gradewise.

Why did the MG101 student
cross the road? Perhaps a worker
incentive was on the other side,
maybe a better grade. The fact is
competition for good grades drives
MGI101.1 wonder how much
would get done in MG101 compa-
nies if Professor Miller closed his
first lecture of the semester with

this announcing, “And remember,
no matter what happens in your
company, everyone will get an A.”
I wonder what the class would be
like if just liberal arts majors took
it. [think MG101 invented the term
“cutthroat” and its no wonder HRM
divisions, excuse me, departments
spend so much on neck bandages.
The MG101 grading logic amounts
to that not only will companies be

Opinion Criticizing
Sojka angers parent

To the Editor:

Because my husband is a
graduate of Bucknell and our son
is currently a student there, we
have subscribed to The Bucknell-
ian for the past three years. We
have enjoyed being kept up-to-
date on campus happenings as
well as concerns and issues fac-
ing the contemporary college
student.

We have expressed issues
of concern to the Administration
on several occasions. Our experi-
ence has been that our griev-
ances were always handled in a
timely, thoughtful and respectful
manner. Conversely, the manner
in which Andrew Cohen ex-
pressed his opinion, “Sojka dug
his own grave,” was disgraceful,
The fact that The Bucknellian
chose to publish it was even

more disgraceful. There is always
room for disagreement, but the
name-calling and crude sarcasm
by which Mr. Cohen attempted to
build his case against President
Sojka was inappropriate.
President Sojka’s first
responsibility is to attempt to
ensure the education of those
enrolled at Bucknell University.
His choice of avenues to achieve
that goal may at times conflict
with others’ individual desires,
President Sojka’s dedicated com-
mitment to the success of the
Bucknell community over the
years did not warrant such a
tasteless, juvenile, disrespectful
tirade by Mr. Cohen. Shame on
The Bucknellian for printing it.

World community’s future
may be in jeopardy

By Joyce Dollinger

Right now we are in a eu-
phoric, hopeful period because of all
the wonderful changes that have oc-
curred in the world. There is unlim-
ited optimism: the Persian Gulf War
and the cold war has ended, the bi-
polar system has changed, the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R. are cooperating
with each other ina friendly manner,
and the Berlin Wall has fallen. It is
as if these awesome things will keep
going on and on and the world will
keep becoming better and better.
Unfortunately, this optimistic period
and this euphoria could be shorter
lived then anticipated. If we want to
learn from the past mistakes in the
global world system, we should “‘so-
berly” Look what is happening today,
and realize that the future might not
be as great as one might think. Thus,

there are a number of trends and pat-
terns that exist that one could argue
are more likely to create problems
then they are to solve problems.

In my opinion, government,
corporation, and people should have
a right to industrialize, produce, and
consume as much as they want, un-
less their actions damage the basic
environment, such as: air, land, and
water. Therefore, all global citizens
have the moral obligation to pre-
serve the quality of the environment,
to allow for the quality of life.

My philosophical approach is
that of utilitarianism, in that justice
provides, “the greatest good or hap-
piness for the greatest number of
people in a given society” stated on

a value source sheet I was given by.

one of my professors. And as this
value source sheet concludes, “de-
termining the greatest good for the

greatest number could be done in a
variety of ways, including a major-
ity electoral or legislative vote, pub-
lic opinion polling, a panel of wise
judges or analysts of human needs,
or a group of psychologists who
‘know’ what makes most people
happy”.

People keep thinking that
technology is going to rescue us, yet
we are entrapped in a self-defeating
technology trend. Utilitarians would
argue that people would benefit from
technology, since government and
public opinion vote for a mechani-
cal, orientated world. However, the
trap we are in is that: for every tech-
nological solution, we create a sig-
nificant problem., For example,
many peopled thought that the
nuclear plant revolution was going

Culture shock awaits those
returning from abroad

By Lisa Hirschkorn

WARNING: I am one of the
99 Bucknellians who studied abroad
last semester and my “culture shock”
could be hazardous to your health.

Jen Marshall’s article, “What
happens when globe-trotting Buck-
nellians return to Lewisburg?” al-
most convinced me that such a warn-
ing label would
apply to me. But
maybe it is not a
bad idea. This
warning would
make a good
button slogan
which could
come in handy. I
could wear the button next to my so-
rority pin, for example, and our
forty-seven new pledges wouldn’t
feel bad about not knowing my
name. With this button, some one
other than my five apartment mates
will understand why they haven’t
seen me on campus for a while. God,
I will even be relieved of hearing the
faux-pas question, “Have you been
abroad?”

Maybe Jen did us a favor by
sounding the culture shock alarm. As
I stroll around campus next Septem-
ber my friends will already know
that I“... could be experiencing these
same re-entry problems right [at

that] very second.” Thanks, Jen.

I imagine that returning to
Bucknell and to America will be a
Strange experience. We will obvi-
ously have to adjust. As I am still in
Europe right now, I can only imag-
ine what is to come. But it must be
weird to re-embrace a society you
have known all of your life and face
difficulties accepting it.

We will definitely be affected

“_..it must be weird to re-embrace
a society you have known all of your life
and face difficulties accepting it.”

by the strangeness of our indigenous
cultures. Okay, we will be “culture-
shocked.” Furthermore, we will feel
this shock at two levels - at Bucknell
and at home.

Jen Marshall’s article, how-
ever, definitely exaggerated my ex-
pectations. I think her view pertains
to students who have studied abroad
for a whole years. From my under-
standing, these students sometimes
don’t go home until the academic
year ends. They must by incredibly
shocked when they do. But I think
this profile describes only a minor-
ity of people.

Theoretically, a semester

abroad means spending three to four
months, or the durations of an aca-
demic semester, in a foreign coun-
try. This might appear like a long
time but the days go by faster than
you can imagine.

As Jen Marshall did, I have
immersed myself in a European cul-
ture. With just one month to go, Ican
say that I have benefited greatly
from this abroad experience. But for
me the culture of
France is a constant
shock. I have lived
with a French family
for the past three
months and still can’t
name the cheeses we
eat at dinner. At the
same time, it is the
challenge of understanding the Eu-
ropeans which makes living here so
exciting.

An abroad experience means
leaving many memories of Bucknell
temporarily behind. But I think that
things there have not really changed
in our absence.

If I forget to wear that wam-
ing button during my first week
back, you will probably be able to
spot me anyway. I’ll be the only per-
son in the Bison (thinking I’m still
in France of course) ordering a ba-

cently, he won a hard fought victory
over Jake “The _ Snitch”
Brondersky’s father in a heated par-
ent-conference. Please welcome, la-
dies and gentlemen, Mike “The
Hammer” Williams.

Let’s get right to the point,
shall we? Last month you suffered
what many thought to be a career-
ending injury, is that right?

Yeah, well. I cut myself with
the paper cutter, when I was trim-
ming some dittos I had mimeo-
graphed. It wasn’t really all that bad.

Yes, but it was it your chalk-
board writing arm, wasn’t it?

Uh, yeah it was my right arm.

Now, you’ve had troubles

with that arm in the past.

I guess. It got caught in the
Xerox machine a few months ago.

But it seems like you’ ve com-
pensated for this devastating series
of injuries by dazzling the fans with
some astounding left arm work.

Um, for a while I had to use
my left hand when I graded papers
and stuff, if that’s what you mean.

And what a commendable
performance you gave, Hammer!

Uhh, thanks.

Now let’s talk about your most
recent bout with Bobby “The Bull”
Hackenschliemer shall we?

Okay.

You showed some dazzling
footwork and catlike reflexes. It was
a truly phenomenal battle, why don’t
you tell the viewers your own per-
ceptions of the triumph.

Well, Bobby was about to
throw an eraser at Susan, and he was
in the back of the room, so I had to
sort of dodge around all the desks
and pull the eraser out of his hand.

And what a commendable
performance it was, Hammer! Did
you knock him out, after your risky
first attack.? Did you end his career?

I sent him to the principal’s
office. He seemed pretty sorry af-
terwards. He’s basically a pretty
good kid.

I see. Let’s talk contracts,
shall we Hammer. Now as we both
know, Evander “The Real Deal”
Holyfield received a cool 12 million
after he punched and hammered his
way to a bloody victory in front of
billions of adoring fans. How are
your numbers looking?

FINISHED! say @ut,

Actually, not bad. This year
I'll be making a little over twenty
thou’ a year.

Uhhh great. Are you taking on
any major endorsements?

Endorsements?

Yes, you know. All great role-
models do endorsements.
Muhammed Ali. Sugar Ray
Leonard. “Iron” Mike Tyson even
has his own boxing video game
where kids can beat up guys just like
he does.

Well, I supervise the patrols.

Super. Why don’t you tell us
how it feels when you look out from
your desk, and you know its just you
against that classroom. Like Ali vs
Frazier or Holyfield vs Foreman or
Bush vs Hussein. How does it feel?

I never really looked at it that
way.

Hammer, I was talking to box-
ing legend James “Buster” Douglas,
last week. He told me the greatest
moment in his career was when he
beat champion Mike Tyson down to
a bloody pulp in front of a packed
arena. What would you say was the
greatest moment of your career?

Well, I’ve taught a bunch of
kids how to read.

Uhhh. Yeah. That’s really
uhhh great.

...And we’ll be right back with
more action after these beer com-
mercials featuring bikini-clad
women bringing booze to sweaty

to provide us with inexhaustible heat
energy. But once we moved into the
nuclear plant age, we recognized that
we had not foreseen the negative
consequences of rising prices, the
possibility of nuclear meltdowns,
nuclear pollution, and the radioac-
tive material that we had not figured
out how to dispose of. So, as an
American, I believe in gaining as
much knowledge about nuclear tech-
nology as one can, but if this wisdom
starts to infringe on the environment,
experiments in the nuclear field
should come to a halt. The global
world should start to obtain knowl-
edge in sources which will not harm
the Earth, such as solar and wind
power. In this way, by creating bet-
ter energy sources to prevent a
nuclear holocaust would be the
“greatest good for the greatest num-
ber of people”. Since we do no know
if there will be slight chance that a
nuclear holocaust can occur, which
may lead to extinction, we cannot
afford to gamble with the Earth.
“Unlike a video game where we can
insert another quarter and try again
when the message ‘GAME OVER’
flashes on the screen, we only have
one Earth and when the game is
over, it’s over,” my friend, Mollie
Legg ‘94 stated.

Then, the Green Revolution

was solicited as a solution to the
malnutrition and hunger problem
throughout the whole third world in
the 1960’s. The Green Revolution
has helped build up agriculture pro-
duction in many third world coun-
tries, but the longer term effects were
to find a quite adverse solution be-
cause it contributed to soil leeching
and soil erosion. Also from the
Green Revolution, the soil, water,
and land pollution from the pesti-
cides destroy some of the produce as
well as some of the farmers and their
children. The farmers find them-
selves becoming increasingly depen-
dent on them until they eventually
get caught up in a seemingly never-
ending cycle. The cycle is a result of
the fact that agricultural chemicals
become progressively more expen-
sive year after year, and at the same
time, less efficient in improving crop
production as pest become resistant
to them.

Yet, my utilitarian morals
make me disagree with the Green
Revolution. In today’s society,
people are generally motivated by
short-term economic goals. In an ef-
fort to reach these profit motivated
goals, producers have caused eco-
logically unsound changes in pro-
duction technology. Thus, I think
that third world countries must ter-
minate this approach because it only

The Bucknellian

benefits these nations on a short-
term level. If the land of the third
world countries deteriorates, what
will they use as a food source in the
future? The land of the first world?
Probably so. Then when our land
weakens, what are we to use? Prob-
ably nothing. In this way, I propose
that the government find a new solu-
tion - organic farming ; such as the

problems and sometimes we get our-
selves into greater problems,” ex-
plained a political science teacher.
Thus, we think we can control the
world. And it is tough to make far
ranging decision, which can contrib-
ute to pessimism of the utilitarians.

Through technology we also
think we will find new food stuffs
that will eliminate the malnutrition

‘_..if we consider in our
high-tech industrialized, consumptive,
materialistic, greedy ways, we are going to
ruin our environment—globally as well as
regionally.”

use of manure. This involves natural
methods of production and is advan-
tageous to both the global environ-
ment and the global economy.
Therefore, in the long run, this will
be “the greatest good” for the third
world nations as well as the first
world nations.

So, “we found that our so-
called technological progress some-
times make it worse rather than bet-
ter and we get ourselves into a trap
because we keep thinking that we
can create better technology to solve

problem and renewable energy
which will eliminate the energy
problem and improve human life and
leisure time which will enable
people to live better lives. But also
through technology that we have de-
veloped, such as weapons, can rap-
idly and more effectively kill us all.
Consequently, technology has not
substantially eased some of these
other problems, it has just made
them worse. As one can see, this is
not a “greater good” for all peoples.

Looking into the future,

economies of growth, materialism,
and consumption will contribute to
the deteriorating environment. Third
world countries and first world
countries are going to put pressure
on resources. Thus, petroleum is go-
ing to keep the prices rising, and air,
land, and water pollution is going to
spread around the world. the ozone
hole is probably going to grow, and
the greenhouse effect is likely to
continue to widen. All of this will
contribute to economic problems,
since we use resources which will
rise in price which hurt the global
economy and all economies. We
need to create a utilitarian value sys-
tem of common good for all peoples,
or else we will fall into a bottomless
pit. Values as respect, cleanliness,
and conservationism for helping the
environment prosper should be initi-
ated for a fair international world.
For so long the greater fear
was that the world could end and
people could be killed by nuclear in-
cineration. And now ecologists say
we have it all wrong - maybe nuclear
deterrence will prevent nuclear was
among the major powers, especially
since there is detente. But, if we con-
sider in our high-tech industrialized,
consumptive, materialistic, greedy
ways, we are going to ruin our envi-
ronment - globally as well as region-
ally. “We are going to be experienc-

ing sufficient land, water, and air
pollution, especially air pollution,
that might ruin our basic ecosystem.
This will make life less sustainable,
since some of this deterioration is
doubling at an exponential rate.
There is CO2 and CFC’s in air and
we do not know how damaging they
are now. Maybe the global tempera-
tures are going to jump. All of this
can dramatically change our lives,”
remarks the same professor. This is
why I believe in utilitarianism. With-
out it as one of my morals, all my
consumptive actions would only
benefit me with happiness and all
other would be miserable. Thus, the
needs and wants of humanity would
not be met because of my selfish ac-
tions.

This is not an optimistic world
any longer. We must act to change
our lifestyles and to get involved in
political and social change groups to
affect the U.S. behavior to become
more respectful to the environment.
If the U.S. changes their greedy, con-
sumptive ways, this might be copied
by other countries of the world to try
to “arrest:” these negative changes
and create a more satisfied, livable
world for the future.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Readers respond to Jeans Day controversy

To theEditor:

I realize that I am beating the
proverbial dead horse by putting
my thoughts in print, but I felt
compelled to respond to the contro-
versy over Jeans Day.

Free speech, action, and
expression are protected by the
Constitution. However, we are all
members of a society in which
certain modes of behavior are ac-
cepted while certain others are
regarded as unorthodox. Consider-
ing this in relation to the general
recognition that heterosexuality is
“normal” sexuality, the American
heterosexual can take pride in his
or her sexual orientation without
feeling inhibited. But the homo-
sexual, an individual contributing
to an oppressed minority, is likely
to come under criticism for his or
her ostracized way of life. So the
A.H.C.H.A. may not realize that its
actions are intensely hurtful, but
any time the majority emphasizes

its already distinguished power, the
minority only feels more
criminalized. Darren Shaw’s stipu-
lation (The Bucknellian, April 26th)
that we should all take pride in our
individuality would essentially be
the reflection of a secure society,
but it is undoubtedly easier to pub-
licly take pride in yourself when so
many of the people around you
share your conventions. In this way
pride no longer becomes a consid-
eration for the homosexual.

Surely we have all been in
the minority at some point in our
lives. Maybe when we were nine
going on ten we could not play
basketball. No one likes being
picked last for a neighborhood
game of hoops. That socially ex-
cluded feeling instigated by a
simple lack of physical ability is so
very demoralizing. I can only imag-
ine feeling this way on a regular
basis. Yet that person who lacks the
physical and emotional ability to
love someone of the opposite sex

faces severe criticism every day of
his or her life. But the
homosexual’s love for someone of
their same sex is just as genuine as
a man’s for a woman or a woman’s
for a man. Homosexuality is not a
chosen sexuality but an inherent
one.

I am not saying that it is easy
to adjust the little world a lot of us
have been raised in to accommo-
date propriety that is not the same
as ours, not the same as most of
society’s for that matter. Even
heterosexuals who support homo-
sexual liberation need to continu-
ally validate their sympathy and the
only way this can be accomplished
is through attempting to understand
one another. Understanding is not a
liberal or a conservative issue, nor
a heterosexual or homosexual one,
it is one that we need to address in
order to become better people.

Liz Shaw ’94
April 26, 1991

To the Editor:

P.O.W.E.R. would like to
address both Evan Maloney’s and
Darren Shaw’s assessment of our
actions with regard to Jeans Day.

First of all, Evan Maloney’s
letter contains some errors. For
example, he accuses POWER of
tearing down the flyers that the Ad
Hoc Committee for Heterosexual
Awareness had put up. The reality
is that our group did not take these
signs down. In fact, your peers and
professors were probably the cul-
prits. We have heard a number of
faculty and students say that they,
not POWER, tore the flyer down.
Secondly, we have been accused of
being “foes of free speech” because
we responded to the AHCHA’s
chalkings. In fact, to Mr. Maloney,
this action is reminiscent of “Nazi
book burnings” and “‘Husseins’s
torching of ... oil fields”. It is inter-

Christian provides Biblical
perspective on homosexuality

To the Editor:

The April 26 edition of The
Bucknellian printed two articles
which raised my attention concern-
ing the opposing views on campus
regarding homosexuality. One view
on campus supports increasing the
human and civil rights of homo-
sexuals. It is supported primarily by
the efforts of F.L.A.G. as well as
other organizations and students
finding this cause appealing. The
other camp has recently taken a
more verbal stance in its beliefs.
The pro-heterosexual, not necessar-
ily anti-homosexual, group of stu-
dents started what has become a
controversy at or around Jeans Day,
April 17. Much has been written
regarding the controversy of this
issue but I find one argument sur-
prisingly scarce.

It seems that nobody has
taken the time or ventured the ef-
fort to print what the Bible has to

say about homosexuality. As a
Christian, I’m very troubled by this
fact. The Bible is, in fact, very
explicit about God’s feelings to-
ward homosexuality. For those of
you who could not care less what
the Bible
says, you can
stop reading
here. But for
those inter-
ested, you
may find as I
have, that
God’s Word
is the definitive answer to the ques-
tion at hand. It transcends all politi-
cal movements for or against gay
rights, as well as, everything es-
poused by F.L.A.G. and the coun-
termeasure F.A.G. (Friends of
Anti-Gays).

Three particular Biblical
references stand out in my mind
regarding homosexuality. The first
is Romans 1:18-32. Verse 25,

“The Bible is, in fact,
very explicit about
God's feelings toward
homosexuality.”

“They exchanged the truth of God
for a lie, and worshipped and
served created things rather than
the Creator who is forever praised.
Amen. (26) Because of this, God
gave them over to shameful lusts.
Even their
women ex-
changed natural
relations for
unnatural ones.
In the same way
the men also
abandoned
natural relations
with women and were inflamed
with lust for one another. Men
committed indecent acts with other
men, and received in themselves
the due penalty for their perver-
sion.” Other references include 1
Corinthians 6:9-11 and 1 Timothy
9:11. I encourage you to look them
up for yourselves,

I write this because I think
there are people who consider

themselves to be Christians but do
not have the faintest notion as to
God’s stance on the matter. I also
write to Evan Maloney, you have
taken the right stance, but make
sure it is backed with the right
motives.

As a Christian, I cannot con-
done or support homosexuality, not
one day out of a year, not ever. The
modem concepts of open-minded
thinking, passivity, and permissive-
ness don’t factor in as a consider-
ation.

Bottom line? Christianity (the
faith this school was founded upon)
never calls for hating or persecut-
ing homosexuals. It does, however,
preclude all Christians from accept-
ing homosexuality as an alternative
lifestyle. Christianity and homo-
sexuality are mutually exclusive.

esting to note, however, that neither
Evan Maloney nor Darren Shaw
were as adamant about defending
the “defacement” of chalk talk last
Spring and this past Fall while our
writings were being changed by
MUFF (Men Upset by Fucking
Feminists), while misogynist com-
ments were added to them, while
we watched a man urinate on one
of our quotes. We did not protest to
these responses, however, precisely
because they were responses. Our
chalk talk elicited response and
reaffirmed our belief that POWER
should exist on this campus.

To respond to Darren Shaw’s
question, POWER wishes to re-
main anonymous because we feel
that our actions are more important
that our identities. For example, if
one reads a poem without knowing
who the poet is, that reader must
determine the worth of the poem on
her or his own. But if a famous

Miller feels just couldn’t be

Everyone has a dream of
the ideal thing they could spend
their life doing, but there’s
something wrong with a society,
or-a professor, that just loves
winners. By the way, in MG101
terms, I’m a big loser. As CEO
in the fall 1989, I led our com-
pany to the lowest grade of the
four companies that semester.
Then, in the fall of 1990, the
board of MG101 didn’t hire me

cally, it probably turned out to
be the best thing that ever hap-
pened to me. I changed my ma-
jor to philosophy from account-
ing upon discovering the fault of
classes like MG101. Due to the
class’s inflexible structure and
the teacher’s authoritative na-
ture, MG101 does nothing more
than fill your soul with “knowl-

reader often assumes that the poem
must then be good. Conversely, if
the reader is predisposed against
the poet already, then she or he is
likely to dismiss the poem.
POWER requests that people
would read our messages instead of
asking the irrelevant question,
“Who did it?” We do not feel that
we are ashamed of our actions, or
that we are “hiding behind a piece
of chalk”. On the contrary, we feel
that our goal to establish dialogue
in the university community has
succeeded. Our chalkings and effi-
gies have been effective in leading
people to discuss the issues of
sexism and heterosexism.

edge.” Of course that may seem
like the point of college, but if
you let me refer to Socrates
again he’ll have a problem with
that. According to Socrates, you
should never go to a peddler of
goods for the soul whose looking
to sell you knowledge, but in-
stead look to find a “physician of
the soul.”

I know it sound fruity, but
on a campus that lists its first
focus as being liberal arts, per-
haps Susan Smith could have
written an article about a class
based on creativity and not busy
work. While the bigger problem
may be a campus wide trend
towards professionalism, the
Bucknellian does not have to
help create this mood. As the job
market continue to look slim,
remember that education can
always have Socratic insight:
“...Don’t find yourself gambling
dangerously with all of you that
is dearest to you.”

poem.

Excerpt from The King and Me
by Daniel Gonzalez

From the beginning it had been the King. Not just any rock and roll
star could move my wife the way Elvis did. Of course, it was Graceland.
She spoke of it often. There was no decision really, only the shrieks of joy
that bounced through our kitchen that afternoon. It made little difference

that I’d been laid off for winter. Her mind set quickly and I knew better .

than to.tempt her stubborness. Besides, it was good to see her smile again.

“Welvin, honey, I’ve never been to Graceland. Hell, I’ve wanted to
go since I was a kid, you know that.” She hopped around the linoleum,
kissing me sloppily between dance steps. “Our first vacation together.
Welvin, it'll be just like a honeymoon.”

We had never had a honeymoon, at least not a real one. I did my best
to make it up to her and collected vacation brochures, waiting for the day I
would come home and spring my triumph. Today was such a day.

She hugged me fiercely, kissed her finger and brought it slowly to
my lips. “I’m going to call Momma,” she whispered.

I had made her a happy woman. I leaned against our counter and
played with the apples, smiling at her as she reached for the phone. My
child bride, God, was she beautiful. The news would wait until after the
vacation. There was plenty of time for me to find a new job before Christ-
mas. I’d saved for this trip and things could hold until we got back. She
beamed proudly at me and I blew her a kiss. This was one time I would not

make a mess of things.

Chips and guests
sing at Weis Center

By Laura Grisin
Staff Writer

As the large crowd in the Weis
Center last Friday would agree, the
Bison Chips’ annual Chipfest was
once again a success. Featured
guests this year were two all-female
groups, the Bates College
Merimanders and the Cornell Uni-
versity Touchtones.

Highlighting the Meriman-
der’s program was “December, 1963
(Oh, What a
Night)” by
Frankie Valli and
the Four Seasons,
complete with
’70’s disco chore-
ography. Their
encore, a song
about the men
who see them-
selves as God’s
gift to women,
was dedicated to
the women in the
audience. Need-
less to say, this song was a hit with
the predominately female crowd that
had turned out to see the Chips.

Cornell’s Touchtones sang a
selection of tunes ranging from
“Cherish” to “Chuckie’s in Love.” A
definite crowd-pleaser was their
only blond member’s rendition of
““Cause I’m a Blond,” after which
she left the audience to wonder if she
really is as airheaded in person as she
was on stage.

At intermission the Chips,
never failing to surprise their audi-

ences, presented a Bugs Bunny/
Elmer Fudd cartoon entitled ““What’s
Opera, Doc?” It was interesting to
note that the crowd of seemingly
mature and intelligent adults were in
hysterics over Elmer bellowing,
“Kill the wa-a-abit, kill the wa-a-
abit, KILL THE WA-A-ABIT!!”
But then again, Chipfest is meant to
be a time to kick back and have fun.

The second half finally
brought the Chips to the stage to sing
favorites like “Moondance” and

“You Can Call
Me Al!” as well
as “Fly in Me
Face” with
Chris Bowen
"91 sporting a
feather and
fruit-topped
hat with gold
tassles. New
tunes included
Chris Williams
"92 ~~ singing
“We're Not
Deep” and An-
drew Lunstad ’91 singing “Hoja.”

A highlight of the concert in-
cluded Tim “Q-Tip” Stahl "90’s re-
turn to Bucknell to emcee the con-
cert and to sing “Coney Island Baby”
with the Chips and other alums,
Chris Waller ’90 and John O’Connor
*89.

Be sure to catch the Bison
Chips as well as Bucknell’s other a
cappella groups, the Harmonex,
Some Singers, and the Silhouettes, at
the Bison Coffeehouse on May 15.

Look to the library for favorite films

The Bertrand Library offers movies free of charge for a night

By Greg Weyant

O.K., you’ve been studying
for finals for the past three days
straight. Your brain has been trans-
formed to strawberry jello, and you
need some sort of relief before you
completely break down in hysteria.
Renting a movie sounds like an ex-
cellent outlet, but it’s 11:30 at night,
the video shop has long since closed,
and you just blew your last SO cents
on a Pepsi.

There is, however, one option
you have not explored—the library.
No, I’m serious. The place where
you've spent the better part of your
college existence has some great
movies that you can take out for the
night absolutely free! As impossible

as it may sound, the Bertrand Li-
brary does have more on video tape
than just third world economic theo-
ries and the inner working of Con-
gress.

Here are 10 great flicks that
Bucknell owns that are yours for the
borrowing any time you get the urge
to just relax and zone out for a while:

Lady Bison head to Championships

Softball enters this weekend's Patriot League tournament as the number two seed with a 25-10-1 record

By Todd Bianchine
Staff Writer

The women’s softball team will meet
Lehigh University tonight at 7:00 p.m. at
Patriot’s Park in Allentown, PA for a first

round match in the Patriot League Softball
Championships. The winner of the game
will go on to play the winner of the Fordham-
Colgate match, but the loser is not out be-
cause the tournament has a double elimina-
tion format. Bucknell goes into the tourna-

° 4

ment as the number two seed with a 9-3

record in Patriot League play and had a

school record 25 victories on the season with
a 25-10-1 record overall.

“Patriot’s Park is just a great place to

play,” said Coach Dale Franquet. “The fans

. down there are just

tremendous and they

really appreciate the

game of softball. If

we win the tourna-

ment we have a pretty

good shot at getting an

ron Nichols ’91 pitched a three-hit shutout
in her final home game as a Lady Bison and
Karen Smolskis ’91 drove in both runs with
two sacrifice flies as Bucknell went on to
win 2-0. The win boosted Nichols’ record to
14-4 on the year with a total of six shutouts.

In the second game, Lisa Fink °93
overcame control problems and the Lady
Bison overcame an early three-run lead to
beat the Tigers 4-3. Smolskis came up big
for Bucknell again as she drove in two runs
on two hits along with a sacrifice fly. Mollie
Laubach ’94 and Fink each had two hits as

batters.

Bucknell was not as fortunate in the
second game, when Colgate scored two runs
in the first inning off four first inning walks
thrown by Fink. Nichols came on to relieve
Fink in the second with Bucknell down 2-1,
but the Lady Bison were unable to get the
bats going and left seven runners on base.
Smolskis was the one exception, pounding
out two hits and stealing two bases.

“T think that [leaving runners on base]
is our biggest problem right now,” said
Franquet. ““We’ve been having trouble get-

Track and Field to | Lax strives to ca
host Patriot Leagues

By Chris Drowne
Staff Writer

It’s been five months since
Christy Mathewson Memorial Sta-
dium has expected a crowd for a ra-
dio-broadcasted sporting event.
This weekend that drought will
come to an end as Bucknell will
host the inaugural Patriot League
Outdoor Track and Field Champi-
onships.

“Being home certainly has
it’s advantages,” said distance run-
ner Norbert Berenyi ’91.The Bison
might need those advantages if they
are going to duplicate their strong
showing at the indoor champion-
ships this past February.

Injuries have decimated the
heavily-favored Bucknell men, who
won the indoor title by 88 points,
turning them into strong contenders.
Fordham, second place finishers at
indoors, will most likely be “look-
ing to do anything to win,” accord-
ing to Bucknell Head Coach Art
Gulden.

The Lady Bison will find
themselves battling it out with the
same two schools that they faced at
indoors. Lafayette is the favorite,
with Bucknell and indoor champ
Fordham.

The championships open
with the pole vault and the men’s
and women’s high jumps this after-
noon. Jeff Schild °92, who won the
indoor title while Joe LaBarge ’93
and Brett Karcher ’93 scored also in
the pole vault, finished second (at
last Saturday’s Millersville Metrics)
and Karcher fourth.

In the men’s high jump,
Blaine Fawcett ’93 tied for fourth
on Bucknell’s all-time list with his
jump of 6’6” at Millersville. Fresh-
man Dawn Ellery’s second all-time
best Bucknell performance at
Millersville shows promise for
points.

Tomorrow the champion-
ships will be in full stride, with all
the running events and the conclu-
sion of the field events. Bob Behler,
the voice of Bucknell football and
basketball, will broadcast four
hours of events, interviews and
highlights on WVBU 90.5.“This.
broadcast will give fans much
greater insight into what’s happen-

ing in front of them,” said Behler.
“The idea is that fans at the meet
can bring a portable radio or
walkman and hear interviews, race
calls and other features that other-
wise would not be available to
them. I don’t think anything of this
magnitude has been tried before,
and we’re excited about this ven-
ture.”

The weight events should
prove profitable for the men and
detrimental for the women. Paul
Austin 91 dominated these events
during the winter and should do the
same tomorrow. Austin qualified
for the IC4A in the discus with a
throw of 46.7 meters at Penn Relays
last weekend. The women, on the
other hand, have not scored a single
point in any of the weight events
this spring.

The sprints and hurdles have
been strong point-scorers for both
the men and women all year. How-
ever, the absence of injured Jean
Simon °94 and Mark Barolo ’93
will open the door for other teams.
Karen Shimomura ’91, who won
the gold medal in the indoor
hurdles, and Lynnette McBride ’91
should finish their careers on high
notes.

The distance contingent is
where the Bison men will turn for
important points. Berenyi, Matt
Deardorff ’92, Jason Cahilly *92,
and Bob Kelly ’92 have been con-
sistent scorers both indoors and out.
Tom Wuchenich °92 should finish
among the leaders in the steeple-
chase.

Gina Abraham °93, Krisitin
Opdyke, 93, and Kelly Marsh °91
will need to run well and score for
the Lady Bison. Marsh qualified for
the ECAC Championships last
weekend at the Penn Relays’
10,000-meter run.

The Penn Relays also show-
cased some excellent relay results.
The men’s 4 x 100-meter qualified
for the IC4A’s while the women’s
4 x 400-meter and 4 x 800-meter
teams established fifth and fourth
place on their respective Bucknell
all-time performance charts.

When asked to evaluate his
team’s chance, Berenyi said,
“We'll have to do well to win. I
think we’re as peaked and ready as

The Bison men’s lacrosse
team split a pair of games this week
when it travelled to Delaware and
Colgate. The team, with only two
games left, hopes to finish the sea-
son with a winning record.

On Saturday Bucknell took on
Colgate in scenic Hamilton, New
York. Unfortunately for Colgate, its
lacrosse skills do not match the
beautiful scenery, as it succumbed to
the Bison offensive, 17-9.

The game began for Bucknell
in a way that has lately become
typical for the team. At halftime, the
score was 6-5 in favor of the heavy
underdogs, Colgate. After the sec-
ond half began, however, the Bison
onslaught began.

Led by Garrett Schwartz °93,
the team did a 360-degree turn-
around and took control of the ball.
Schwartz scored four for Bucknell,
while Doug DePietro ’92 added
three of his own. Matt Pearce ’91,
Kevin Roth ’92, and Erik Herrema
*93 all scored two goals as well in
the effort. Colin Barker 94 started

Garrett Schwartz ’93 led the effort

the game and allowed six goals on
12 shots while Matt Wojnovich ’94
blocked two of five shots.

Overall, Head coach Sid
Jamieson was pleased with the
team’s play, noting that it did an
excellent job getting back into the
game after being down at the half.

He said, “Colgate was a
scrappy little team. They really
made a contest out of it when we
weren’t exactly executing the things
we should have been executing.” He
added, “We took a little longer to get
going. In the second half we took
over and suddenly it was no longer a
contest.”

Responding to the suggestion
that the team’s lackluster first-half
play may simply be a result of the
long schedule this season, Jamieson
replied, “We have to work hard to
play well. We need to outhustle. At
Colgate we needed to get our our
legs under us and get a second
wind.”

Jamieson acknowledged the
work of Todd Streelman ’92 who
also had five assists to lead the Bi-
son attack. He said, “He is definitely
a strong player physically. He plays

team has been working hard, Lisa [Fink]
threw a good game against Towson, and
Sharon [Nichols] has seen some more in-
nings to build up her stamina for the tourna-
ment.”

Bucknell graduates three seniors from
the team, tri-captains Jen Kalochie,
Smolskis, and Nichols. The three have led
Bucknell to a current four-year record of 87-
50-1 with the record 25 victories this season.

Kalochie has started at second base all
four years of her career and is currently hit-
ting .319. However, she has been more
noted for her fine play in the field as well as
her inspiration and leadership of the squad.

Smolskis leaves Bucknell with a
record 128 games played and has started 126
of them. She is currently ranked among
Division I leaders in home runs and RBI’s
and is batting a respectable .317. She has
also been recognized for her great speed and

time.” Streelman had four goals and
seven assists in the two games this
week.

The Bison headed to Dela-
ware on Wednesday where they
suffered a heartbreaking defeat, 12-
11. The Bison went into the game
hoping to get off to a fast start and
did just that jumping out to an early
lead. Jamieson said, “We played ag-
gressively and ran off to a 4-0 lead.
We made critical errors in the fourth
quarter. We didn’t win our face-offs
and we got impatient with ball con-
trol.” He added, “We failed to score
with a man down at a time when we
could have stretched our lead. At the
end we simply could not execute.”

Streelman was the high
scorer with four goals, while
DePietro had three and Justin
Zackey °94 had two. The offense
once again kept the Bison in the
game. Although the offense ap-
peared to be a weak spot earlier this
year, several key players have taken
over the offensive reins and carried

the team.

One of the big surprises of
the day was the play of Wojnovich.
Relegated to the job of second string
goalie at the beginning of the season,
the freshman has been given the
starting nod from Jamieson after
Barker’s dismissal from the team.
Wojnovich responded by blocking
21 of 33 shots in the game against a
hard-shooting Delaware squad. As
Jamieson said, “He played super. He
was absolutely outstanding.”

maining, Jamieson is confident the

second place in the Patriot League
and to get the points.” He added,
“We need to finish our work in the
Patriot League to prove we are as
good as I think we are. We have a
great team and the kids are coming
along well. Good things are going
on with this program.” Monday the

Athletes reflect on major injuries

By Melissa Skelton

Injuring a knee can be a pain-
ful experience for the average per-
son, but for an athlete, the effects are
devastating, often life-altering.
Knee injuries, unlike ankle sprains
or chronic injuries, require more
than just a tape job to put an athlete
back on the playing field. For four
Bucknell athletes, such injuries
meant re-evaluating their futures
here.

Men’s basketball recruit Chris
Simpson °94 suffered a bone chip
fracture while playing in a high
school alumni basketball game in
Virginia. Had the damage to
Simpson’s knee been permanent, he
might not have continued at Buck-
nell. “I might have transferred from
this school. Basketball is a big part
of my life... things would be so dif-
ferent. I just might have transferred
at the end of the year to one of the
other schools that accepted me.”

Simpson's reaction may seem
severe, but Kelly Kempton ’93, a
women’s varsity basketball player,
echoed Simpson’s willingness to re-
structure his college career: “Part of
my dream was to just go to a Divi-
sion I school and play, because I love
the sport. And I thought, “There is
no way I can stay here and not play
basketball.’”

Kempton had begun noticing

a gnawing ache in her knee during
pre-season, and as the playing sea-
son started, the
pain intensified.
“In about October,
I could tell that it
was affecting my
play. Even Mark
{Keppler] the
trainer said it.
‘Kelly, you can’t
play, you can’trun
up and down,’ and
1,AidweN QP OLI Es,
ally.” So that’s
when they all
(Keppler, assistant
trainer Julie Au-
gustine, and or-
thopedic surgeons
Gale Reish and
John Magill] did
the tests and said,
‘Kelly, we think
you have torn
cartilege.’”

“They said it
would take 4-6
weeks or 6-8
weeks [for rehab]
depending on the
injury. In the back
of my mind, I was
thinking, “‘My
knee’s never go-
ing to be the same.

Am I really going Jeff Kelly 92,

red-shirt.

The Bison quarterback’s dedi-
cation to sports is evident. “I love
playing the game, and I’ve got five
years to play four, so I can take that
extra year and use up my eligibility,
and I’m sure I’d want to do it some-
where. Definitely. I’m an athlete.
I’ve been an athlete since I was eight
years old. It’s something in me; I
have to play, I have to do this. I tore
my knee playing intramural basket-
ball. I’m always doing something.”

An injury, such as the one to
Kelly’s knee, is one from which
many athletes do not fully recover.
He suffered a torn anterior cruciate
ligament, the primary ligament
holding the knee joint together.
Usually, when an athlete tears the
ligament as seriously as Kelly did,
returning to 2 varsity sport is un-
likely. He was fortunate that a pro-
cedure called an allograft, a tissue
transplant from an organ donor, was
a surgical option. Jeff Kelly was
aware of this from the beginning.

“You sit there and think, ‘what
if I actually did hurt myself?’ As an
athlete, you always hear about knee
injuries. You think, ‘Oh no, a knee
injury!’ That’s like death to an ath-
lete. I tried to be optimistic and say,
‘No, that’s not what it is,’ but in the
back of your mind, it could be. If it
is a knee injury, that’s a bad thing as
far as athletes go.”

When he heard about the ex-
tent of the damage to his knee, Kelly

back on the court
after this?’”

Because Kempton was able to
return to the game after four weeks
of rehabilitation, she did not have to
sacrifice an entire season. However,
this was Kempton’s second injury
since coming to Bucknell, and the
last one caused her to miss most of
her freshman season.

Speaking of the first injury,
Kempton said, “Actually, it wasn’t
as bad. I didn’t think I was going to
get much playing time anyway, and
I didn’t mind it so much because I
knew I had three more years. Also, I
knew I could get red-shirted, and I
could have that fourth year, so tech-
nically I could still have my four
years of college playing that I
wanted. This year’s was much more
pressure. The dream of playing four
years has been cut down to three.”

The idea of red-shirting is a
popular one in college athletics.
NCAA athletes have the opportunity
to sit out one season in order to
maintain four years of eligibility.
This allows serious athletes with in-
juries or 5 year academic programs
to best utilize their playing time.
Julie Bachman GR, 1990-91
women’s basketball co-captain was
able to play as a red-shirt for Buck-
nell this year because of an injury
during her undergraduate years.
Similarily, had the injury Jeff Kelly

_ 92 sustained occurred at any other
time and caused him to miss a sea-
son, he would also have opted for the

was devastated. “The guy told me I
had a torn ACL, and that was just a
major blow. I had told my parents
not to even bother to come for the
surgery... but if they hadn’t been
there that day, hell would have just
broken loose, because I was just so
broken up.”

Kelly’s injury was well-timed.
He was playing basketball just be-
fore Thanksgiving break, after the
football season ended. With consul-
tations, surgery and rehabilitation
time, Kelly will just make it back in
time for the 1991 season. “Each day,
that day that I’ll be back gets pushed
closer to now. The original date was
August 1, but my progress has just
been great.”

Not many athletes with
Kelly’s injury are as lucky. Julie
McCausland ’91 has been playing
field hockey and lacrosse every year
since her freshman year of high
school. In order to determine
whether her knee was in good
enough condition to play lacrosse
this spring, McCausland had to pass
a series of “pivot shift” tests to test
the flexibility and strength of her
knee in playing situations. When her
knee gave out during the final test,
she broke down. “T really just cried.
This was my last test; if 1 passed this
test, 1 was going to be playing.”

This year’s injury is not a new
one for McCausland. The original
trauma to her knee occurred during

her senior year of high school. Sev-
eral surgeries and years of rehabili-
tation later, McCausland again had
to sit out a season. Having reinjured
her knee this past summer and dis-
covering that a staple from the origi-
nal surgery had come loose and
lodged itself in her joint,
McCausland’s pain, physical and
mental, resurfaced. “I thought, ‘Oh
no, not again. I don’t know if I can
stand this.’ I had to rehab all over
again, and that was bad enough.”

McCausland’s decision not to
play was exactly that_a conscious
choice. Knowing that with her par-
ticular situation, further damage
could be permanent and life-threat-
ening, she chose not to take the risk.
“T just can’t take the chance, and I
knew it, I knew that was the answer.
And that’s why when my knee pivot
shifted out, even though the staple
wasn’t a factor yet, I decided no, I
can’t play, because I never ever want
to have another reconstruction. Talk
to anybody on this campus; recon-
structions are just hell.”

The doctor informed her that
once her knee reached a point of less
than 15 percent deficiency in range
of motion, she could play. Her re-
sponse was, “Buddy, I am not play-
ing.” She explained, “I never went
back when they said it would really
endanger me. Once it really oc-
curred to me that, ‘Julie, you may
have to get another reconstruction
and you may lose...’ I could never

to be Julie, the Sem Gem, and Julie,
the bio major, but I’m also Julie, the
lacrosse player, and | take a lot of
pride in that. I like that, I like that
part of me.”

For the younger players, the
issue of playing is more pressing.
For both Simpson and Kempton, it
was dfficult to sit and watch other
young players move up the ranks.
Simpson said, “I would watch
Raymond [Brown ‘94] get some
playing time, and although I was
glad he was doing well, I kept think-
ing, ‘that could be me,’ and it made
me work even harder.”

Kempton pointed out how
hard it was to sit and watch practice
while she was rehabilitating. “You
want to do it so bad, but you can’t.
You can't play. It’s amazing that
you can’t play.” When she returned,
she noted how different her skills
were at first. “I was very frustrated
when I got back on the court. I
didn’t play very well... my shots
weren’t going in, I wasn’t playing,
and I was getting so frustrated. I was
backtracking to seventh and eighth
grade for fundamentals.”

For Simpson, it also put the
greater picture into perspective. “I
only had three more years. The
chances of playing beyond college
are little or none. I realized that in
my four years here, I was more com-
mitted to do my best in anything I
aspired to do.”

Kelly feels
an inherent com-
pulsion to play,
difficult to sup-

_ press even for a
serious injury.
“It’s just the

. competitive na-
ture of it. Ath-
letes have grown
up doing these
same things all
their life; playing
football, basket-
ball, baseball, any
sport, and I
played all three in

I got here. That’s

imagine losing a leg or having a per-
manent limp. Never. I would never
ever want that. Lacrosse does not
mean that much.”

Not that she doesn’t take her
athletics seriously. Of her future in
sports, McCausland says, “My
spring semester has always been la-
crosse; I don’t know what I would
do without it. Now I have to be a
different type of athlete; I want to
get into biking... walking; running’s
really going to be out because right
now it just hurts too much. Mark
[Keppler] said to me, ‘This doesn’t
mean you’re no longer an athlete,
this means you have become another
type of athlete.”

McCausland serves as the
team manager so she can remain an
active member of the team. “I’ve
loved all the experiences I’ve had. I
still go to practice every day.” Al-
though she cannot imagine life with-
out lacrosse, she does not believe she
would have altered her college plans
to red-shirt had her injury occurred
earlier in her career. “‘No, it doesn’t
mean that much to me. I have a
schedule for life... I probably would
have done the same thing I am now
[managing]. No, I wouldn’t have
stayed on.”

Asked what it is then that
makes an injury so difficult to
handle, she explained, “Because you
define yourself that way; that is me.
I’m Julie, the lacrosse player. I’m

you.’

And how
will the future
shape up for these athletes?

Simpson: “I threw myself into
rehab. Every moment I wasn’t eat-
ing or sleeping I was in the training
room doing something or other.” He
was able to retum to the court before
the season finished, and promises to
be in the running for a starting posi-
tion next fall.

Kempton: “When it first hap-
pened, I thought, ‘Oh my god, sur-
gery. They’re taking my knee,
they’re going into my knee.’ Com-
pared to some of the other surgeries
I saw though, I thought, ‘Well,
maybe I’m kind of lucky.’ She also
retumed before the end of the '91
season, and with ‘two full years
ahead, barring further injury, will be
a top contender.

Kelly: “I’m sure the first time
I go out there and I run around and
start cutting, I’m going to be wary of
it just to see how it works.
Somebody’s going to hit me the first
time, and I’m proobably going to get
up and shake it off, and then maybe I
can get back into it. But I’m sure I
have to climb that hill and get to that
point where I can say, ‘Yeah, I’m
confident in my knee enough to be
confident in myself enough where I
can perform to what I expect myself
to do.’”

“Everybody’s been so great.
My parents were great; without your
family members, you’d have a very
hard time getting through it... my

1991 MEN’S TENNIS TEAM

The 1991 men’s tennis team is selected Athletes of the Week for
winning the Patriot League Championship this past weekend at Colgate
University. The Bison captured two of the individual titles outright and
ammassed numerous other point earning performances.

Army came into the tournament heavily favored and the top seed in
every category except second doubles. Bucknell was expected to finish
no better than third or fourth in the championships.

brother too. The good Lord, he
works miracles all the time. I’m sure
he’s working his stuff on me. It al-
most seems that things are going so
well, almost too well. I don’t mind
it one bit, but I guess I’m still leery:
‘Be careful, don’t be stupid, don’t
jeopardize what you’ve worked so
hard to get to, to get back to.’ It’s a
struggle, and I’ve got a lot of help,
so I’m going to make it.” With the
graduation of Todd Hatajik ’91 this
year, Kelly is likely to be the next
Starting quarterback for the Bison.
McCausland: “[{What stands
out is] the fact that it made me a bet-
ter person in a lot of ways. It made
me look outside of myself as well to

other people. I could have just
whined and cried, and I think I’ve
always really taken it with a mature
attitude and really worked hard. I’m
very proud of that fact, that I’ve
come back. Its a healthy way to live,
being in shape, so I need to do it
anyway.”

“There’s always a ‘why me?’
I don’t ask that very much though.
Why ask it?”

McCausland’s lacrosse career
may have reached its end, but the
spirit of the sport will continue in her
and the other athletes endlessly, and
no physical injury can stand in the
way.

who scored four goals. She is tied for
the lead in goals scored this season
with Jen Kehoe '94, with 24. Kehoe
contributed two goals against
UMBC. Jennifer Hayes °93, Tricia
Way °94, Leslie Why ’92, and Sue
Wells °93 each added one. Defen-
sively, Kahra Foster ’92 played well,
making several one-on-one saves.

This contest followed a game
at home versus Slippery Rock Uni-
versity. Again the offense was
paced by Ellwood and Kehoe as they
scored four and three goals respec-
tively in the Bison’s 15-11 victory.
But the true tale of the game was
Bucknell’s domination at midfield,
where Alison Arth ’93, Way, and
Sue Signori ’93 combined for five
goals. Arth tallied two and joined
the defense with an aggressive and
confident style of play.

Why and Julie Goeller ’91
also added offensive spark with two
goals apiece.

Averill was very pleased with
the victory. “The team kept their in-
tensity and it payed off during this

game. It was a great win for Buck-
nell.”

The women began their week
as they traveled to Drexel in an in-
tensive matchup. Bucknell battled
strong early, but a ten minute lapse
in the first half left the team down 9-
3 at halftime. The Bison did, how-
ever, come alive in the second half,
outscoring Drexel 4-3. But, their
lapse in the first half had left them
with an insurmountable gap to
overcome and they fell 12-7 in the
contest. Seven different Bison each
scored once in the defeat.

Averill gave Drexel a lot of
credit for their level of play and
hustle on the field, but commented,
“Our youth and inexperience were
two factors that set us back in this
game. Little things like turnovers
and dropped balls were some of our
weaknesses.”

This Saturday the womens’
lacrosse team concludes its season as
they host Cornell at 1 p.m. The Bison
will be trying to avenge a 14-5 loss
to the Big Red which they suffered
last season.

Bucknellians aid local Little League

By Mitch Benton
Staff Writer

It is a natural combination,
Bucknell University and the Lewis-
burg Township Little League. A
great deal of the Little League’s ad-
ministration and coaching personnel
are associated with the school, either
as a member of the faculty or student
body.

These participants see the
Little League as an opportunity to
return favors to a tradition that
helped them to grow as athletes and
people. Ray Randel, coach of the
Pennsylvania House squad and as-
sistant director of financial aid,
claims that he is trying to give to his
son what his father gave to him.
“When I was young, about nine or
ten years old, there was no Little
League in my town and my father
and a group of other fathers started
an 11-12 year old league of orga-
nized baseball. After I graduated
from that league, he started a Babe
Ruth League [for high school stu-
dents].”

The children begin their Little
League careers with a T-ball league
for six to eight year olds. In this
league the youngsters, both girls and
boys, get a feel for the game hitting
the ball off of a set tee, with the

pitcher acting only as another
fielder. After outgrowing this
league, they move on to the minor
league, for nine to twelve year olds;
the girls play softball, and the boys
playing baseball. Overlapping the
minor league is the major league,
which takes its players from the best
of the minor leaguers.

After the players turn thirteen,
they can join the Senior League, for
which they can play until they are
sixteen. A usual season consists
of at least twelve games,
normally up to fourteen;
most begin in early
April. Many of the
Senior League play-
ers also play on the
high school team
and they must wait Gy
until after that season ends.

Pete Bergonia, a 22-year

veteran of the Bucknell staff and cur-

rent physical plant employee, has
been the Little League President for
three years. Discussing the league’s
relationship with Bucknell, he said,
“The relationship is natural. Along
with the first-hand help that Buck-
nell faculty and students are giving,
there is also a great deal of other
types of support.

“I know a number of fraterni-
ties sponsor teams financially as

well as in other ways, Their mem-
bers come out and help teach and
umpire and just cheer for their teams.
I know that when they come out and
root for the kids, it gives a tremen-
dous boost to the players.” The three
fraternities that sponsor teams are
Phi Gamma Delta, Lambda Chi Al-
pha, and Sigma Phi Epsilon.

Chris Drowne ’93 con-
tinues his life-long associa-
tion with the Little League

by coaching the West Milton

ately known as the Lewisburg

Orioles. Drowne in-

herited his team

from Kyle Rude ’90,

BAqUE | for whom he as-

sisted last season.

Jon Terry °93 and

Kirk Peters "93 work hard as

valuable assistants. Matt

Deardorff *92, who runs for

Bucknell’s cross country and track

teams, will join the staff at the end
of the school year.

For Drowne, this is the ninth
team that he has coached since he
began when he was sixteen. He be-
lieves that his only problem with be-
ing coach is that the umpires do not
give him enough respect.

When asked about his rival
coach, Randel says that “Chris runs

an outstanding program and he isn’t
looked down upon at all by the other
coaches in the league. He is well re-
spected.” Drowne has already
planned to take the first few weeks
off of his summer employment so
that he can continue to coach the
team through the season’s comple-
tion.

While Bergonia says the
league’s purpose is the teaching and
excitement that its participants ex-
perience, he is obviously also ex-
cited by its success. “Last summer,
for the first time, our major league
all-star team won the District 13
Championship and went on to play
in the Sectionals against
Shippensburg.” Had the Lewisburg
won that game the team would have
played another for the right to attend
the Little League World Series, held
every year in Williamsport.

For Bergonia, the participation
is a family matter. While his
daughters help by coaching, his wife
runs the auxiliary functions. “I love
participating with my family in this
league, the only downfall is that
many summer nights end in dinner
around the hot dog stand.”

These Bucknellians certaintly
receive at least as much from their
participation as they give. These
dedicated volunteers include

Crew sweeps at LaSalle Invitational

By Kyle Betz
Staff Writer

Last weekend Bucknell hosted
the Annual Bucknell Invitational
Regatta, which resulted in a virtual
mint of Bucknell medals. On that
picture perfect day, there were five
Bucknell golds, three Bucknell sec-
ond place finishes and even a token
last place for a spirited Bucknell
alumni men’s varsity eight.

In the serious races, the Bison
men’s Varsity Four took second with
a time of 7:36.48 behind a fast and
experienced Loyola crew that fin-
ished in 7:35.00. The Bucknell
women’s varsity eight took gold
with a time of 8:33.00, beating West

men’s varsity eight finished second
behind Franklin & Marshall, in a
too-close-to-call finish. .72 seconds

son did not in any way rest. They
pounded out 16 runs on 20 hits, and
were led by—wait, take a guess—
Koerner and Ahrens. The latter went
three for three with a homer and five
RBI, while Koerner chipped in four
hits, including a double and his
team-high eighth triple of the year.
Mike Kearns ’93 (3-5, 2 RBI, 2
runs), Gyimesi (2 hits, 2 RBI, 2
runs), and Larry Trout ’93 (3 hits, 2
RBI, 2 runs) also played well.
Pitcher Denis Maguire ’93:(1-2) was
able to withstand Colgate’s eight-
run, 14-hit attack for eight innings
before letting Brian Hildick ’93 fin-
ish up.

On Tuesday, Mt. St. Mary’s
came to town and probably figured
that ten runs and 15 hits would be
enough to beat the Bison. Not this
week, though. Ahrens’ three hit,

cit with a four-run sixth inning, the

crews. The Bison men’s lightweight
varsity four took gold in a time of
8:41.00 beating the next closest boat,
WVU, by eight seconds. The Lady
Bison women’s varsity four took
gold with a time of 8:58.00.

In Novice action, the Bucknell
women’s eight took second in the
only race of the day with two heats.
They finished nine seconds behind
the Franklin and Marshall boat that
finished in 7:30.00. The Bucknell
men’s heavyweight eight raced in
the same heat as their own light-
weight eight. The two Bison crews
dominated the race and the heavies
finished in 7:24.50 ahead of the
lights who pulled a 7:29.93.

Bucknell University crew team trav-

frame as the 1991 edition of
Murder’s Row batted around, scor-
ing four runs. Koemer (1-0) put
away the lumber for a few innings,
pitching the last two innings in no-
hit fashion, striking out four, to
notch the win.

On Wednesday the Bison
travelled out Route 80 to play
Bloomsburg, and the result was an
impressive 15-0 thrashing. Let’s
start with the pitching for a change.
After all, even if Bucknell only
managed one run, they still would
have won. Jack Kazanjian 93 (5-2)
started and pitched seven shutout
innings, striking out eight while only
giving up four hits. Rich Heller ’94
finished up with two perfect innings,
striking out three more.

Offensively, there were plenty
of crooked numbers to go around in
the Bucknell boxscore. The two,

(Koerner, Kennedy, and Ahrens)
combined to go nine for 14 with six
home runs (2 apiece), 12 RBI, and

morning the Bison launched from
the dock with anxious and tense
strokes, preparing for an important
race. In the race, which consisted of
a preliminary heat, semis, and finals
for each category, four Bucknell
boats advanced to the finals.

The men’s varsity four took
second in the final, nipping at the
heals of a LaSalle boat that they had
already beaten in the semis. In that
boat Kim Dobies ’91 coxed Dave
Rhodes 92, Doug Lebda ’92, Tripp

Dobies was not disappointed
in her crew and she said, “We rowed
a tough race and it just shows us that
the level of our competition should
not be underestimated — they’ll see
us at Dad Vails, that’s for sure.”

There were 17 schools in their

nine runs scored. Matt Sinegocki
’93 drove in the other three runs with
his first homer of the year, and Jeff
Karnes ’92 went two for two and
scored twice. In all, the offense
battered six Bloomsburg hurlers for
15 runs and 17 hits (11 of them for
extra bases, including a club record
seven homers).

The Bison played their sixth
game of the week yesterday at home
against Pittsburgh, winning 5-2.
Freshman pitcher Jim Stevens (3-0)
won his second consecutive start.
Stevens went the distance, allowing
just two unearned runs on six hits.
Ahrens got things started in the bot-
tom of the second with a solo homer,
his seventh of the year and third in
the last two days. After Pitt tallied
its two uneamed runs in the fourth,
Kennedy retied it with a sacrifice fly
in the bottom of the inning. The Bi-
son went in front for good in the fifth
when Mike Kearns *93 plated a
triple past Larry Trout. Run-scoring
singles by Ted Obligado ’91 and Jim
Zervanos ’92 in the sixth capped off
the scoring.

behind a fast Drexel crew who took
first. In novice action, the men’s
heavyweight eight took sixth in their

This weekend, Bucknell will
host the Patriot League Champion-
ships on the scenic Susqehanna
River. The temporary launch loca-
tion of Bucknell Crew activities is at
the Pine Knotter Park, across: the
river and two miles north of the nor-
mal Tedd’s Landing regatta location.

Although crew is not a recog-
nized Patriot League sport, five Pa-
triot League schools will still com-
pete in this Regatta including Buck-
nell, Army, Lafayette, Lehigh, and
Colgate.

Bucknell’s record now stands
at 23-11-1, 8-4 in the Patriot League.
The Bison hurlers have surprised
many people over the course of the
year. Jim Stevens ’94 has shown
much promise late in the year. He
attributes the development of his
curveball and other off-speed pitches
to much of his success. He is now 3-
0 with a 1.19 ERA, and is holding
opponents to a paltry .212 batting
average. In general, Stevens credits
Bucknell’s late season surge to team
unity. “Once we got our momentum
going, there was a snowball effect.
One guy got hot, then the rest of the
team just picked up,” said the fresh-
man righthander from Carrolltown,
PA.

Koerner has been another key
member. In addition to his torrid bat,
Koerner has a 1.40 ERA in nine
games on the mound. He has picked
up a win and three saves while
holding opposing batters to a .169
batting average. Koerner feels that
the warm weather has everyone
feeling good right now. “Up and
down our lineup everyone is hot,”
said Koerner. “There is no weak
link—there is no time for the pitcher
to relax.”

Hopefully, everyone will re-
main hot for one more weekend.
Bucknell will travel to Lafayette for
a three-game series in Easton.
Fordham (12-3) wrapped up the Pa-
triot League title with a 12-inning
win over Holy Cross. Holy Cross
finished the season at 11-4, so a
sweep of Lafayette would be neces-
sary to gain a share of second place
in the conference for Bucknell.

Lafayette is led offensively by
Mark Rowland and Brian Shevitz,
who leads the league with eight
home runs. Rob Hatalovsky and

Bob Pogyor are their best pitchers,
and are likely to face the Bison this
weekend.

well as Mark Kerr, from the career

Randel sums up his involve-

ment in the Lewisburg Little League,

ing to do the same for my son.”

he Bucknellia

ennis takes Patriot League crown

By Mike Markovich
Staff Writer

In what was one of the biggest
surprises in recent Bucknell sports
history, the men’s tennis team over-
came tremendous odds and defeated
a heavily favored Army squad to
take the overall team trophy at the
inaugural Patriot League Champi-
onship last weekend.

The Bison finished their
matches with a team total of 30
points, enough to fend off Army and
Colgate, who tied for second with 26
points each. The rest of the teams
were basically along for the ride,
with Fordham finishing fourth with
15 points, Lehigh fifth with 13,
Lafayette sixth with 10, and Holy
Cross bringing up the rear with 2.5
total points. All the individual titles
were split between the top three
overall finishers, with the highlights
of Bucknell’s victory coming in the

forms of a number three singles
championship for Andrew Cantor
’92 and the number three doubles
crown going to Cris Stenstrém "94
and partner Scott Bank ’91.

From the outset, Coach Craig
Reynolds felt that, if the team played
a “very good” tournament, they
would finish second at best. Fol-
lowing Friday night’s seeding
meeting, which set Army as the top
seed in all but the number two
doubles bracket, Reynolds felt that
“no coach in the room would’ ve
picked anyone but Army to win that
tournament.”

But, due to the way the scoring
was set up, all those top seeds turned
out to be somewhat of a detriment
for the feared Army squad. Each
match won during the tournament
brought its team two points. Since
Army had byes in the first round of
every bracket for which it held the
top seed, which included all six

sees

singles flights, eight of their nine
first matches became worth four
points for a victory, and nothing if
they lost.

As Reynolds points out, “The
first match you play in a tournament
is often your most difficult, and this
hurt Army badly as they lost three
out of their first six singles matches,
each of those representing a four
point turnaround for them.” Those
three defeats came at numbers three,
four, and five singles, with the
number four defeat of Army’s top-
seeded Ivan Brown coming at the
hands of Bucknell’s Stenstrém.
Reynolds called this 6-2, 6-1 match
“one of the biggest upsets of the
tournament. Cris played very smart
and very well, and this semifinal
match was an example of a four
point tumaround from Army directly
to us.”

Victoria Gorman ’93 leads the
women's water polo to nationals

By Andrea Falcione

If waking up at 5:30 a.m. to
drive 20 minutes for two hours of
vigorous exercise is not your idea of
a fun way to spend a summer mom-
ing, then you may not envy Victoria
Gorman ’93. However, if you have
ever had dreams of being an Olym-
pic athlete, then you may change
your mind. Gorman is Bucknell’s
leading female water polo player,
and her Olympic dreams are just
barely beyond her reach. Beyond her
reach for the sole reason that
women’s water polo, unlike its male
counterpart, has yet to be recognized
as an Olympic sport.

Gorman, only a sophomore at
Bucknell, started playing water polo
at the age of 14, when her Naval
Academy Junior Swim Club coach
decided to establish a junior water
polo team. According to Gorman,
she “just naturally took to the game”
and immediately began to excel.

After only a year and a half of
experience with the game, she tried
out and was chosen to train at the
Olympic Training Center in Colo-
rado. That same year her club team
competed in Junior Olympics for the
first time, where they did not fare
well.. However, she and her team
returned the following year to cap-
ture first place, beating even the far
more experienced West Coast teams.

Despite her passion and talent
for water polo, Gorman did not limit
her athletic abilities to polo; she was
also a four-time varsity letter winner
in swimming and a two-time varsity
letter winner in lacrosse during her
high school career.

The spring of 1989, her senior
year in high school, saw Gorman’s
first national recognition, when she
made the Junior National “B” team.
Upon entering the Bucknell aquatics
scene as a freshman, Gorman prac-
ticed with the men’s water polo team
in the fall, swam on the women’s

swim team throughout the winter,
and was the key to the Bucknell
women’s club water polo team dur-
ing the spring. Her coach, Marla
Cautilli, says of Gorman, “She ab-
solutely makes our team. What can I
say except that she’s awesome! I
think Vicki has a tremendous future
as an international water polo player.
She’s still young, but give her five
years and she’ll be a dominant factor
on the international scene.” While
playing for the Bucknell women’s
team, she was moved up to the Jun-
ior National “A” team for national
competition.

The honors were just begin-
ning for Gorman in 1990, however.
Her young club team from Annapo-
lis, MD traveled to Senior Nationals
for the first time that summer, where
they finished an impressive eighth of
16 teams. There she was named as a
second team All-American. Then,
during the Hawaiian Invitational
Tournament, she was officially cho-
sen by the Junior National coach to
be a member of the Junior World
Championship team, which will
compete in an international tourna-
ment in her hometown of Annapolis
during June of 1991.

Gorman returned once again
to the Bucknell men’s water polo
team during the fall of 1990, where
she has had to become stronger and
faster in order to play at the men’s
level. Of her experience playing with
the men’s team, Gorman says, “I feel
honored to play with the guys, and I
wouldn’t be where I am now without
having had the opportunity to prac-
tice with them,”

Christmas-time brought more
than just gifts under the tree for
Gorman. During a try-out trip to
California in December, she
achieved her greatest accomplish-
ment in the sport thus far—she was
chosen for the Senior National “A”
team, skipping the Senior “B” level
altogether. Her position on the Se-

nior team, equivalent to an
esi squad, will be a learning
experience in more than one way,
Gorman believes. “Being a member
of the national team is rewarding in
many ways. It will allow me to
compete on an international level
and to travel to foreign countries. It
will be a cultural as well as an ath-
letic experience, ” she says. Being a
member of the National “A” team
has been very demanding for
Gorman, as it required her to travel
to California three to six weekends
at the start of the semester, as well as
the week of Spring Break for an
Easter training camp.

Gorman is not only a premier
athlete, however; she may be one of
Bucknell’s best examples of a
scholar-athlete as well. A double
major in english and philosophy, she
maintains a 3.2 grade point average.
She divides her days between class,
practice, and studying throughout
both semesters and all three athletic
seasons.

Gorman reasons, “I’ve always
believed that grades and school are
important. Since I’ve been at Buck-
nell, I’ve managed to budget my
time effectively so that I can main-
tain good grades, intensive training,
and even find time to have fun with
my friends.”

The Bucknell team of which
Gorman is a member is led by cap-
tains Elaine Lammey GR and varsity
swimmer Carla Banashek ’91 as
well as their experienced senior
class, which consists of five other
women, Freshmen varsity swimmers
Anne-Marie Nielson and Lisa, Bell
also bring previous experience to the
team, having played water polo prior
to arriving at Bucknell. The team
boasts of three other returning play-
ers and five promising rookies. The
women have travelled to Maryland
and Slippery Rock for tournaments
this spring and have also hosted two
Bucknell tournaments.

semifinal, in which he and Bank de-
feated Army’s top-seeded duo of
Whalen and Schaaf 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (8-
6). What the final score doesn’t
show is that Bank and Stenstré6m
were down 5-2 and three service
breaks in the third set, only to save
four match points, force the
tiebreaker, and win it for the victory
and another four points snatched
from Army. The hot duo then
downed Lafayette’s Manger and
Swamy 6-3, 6-0 in the final to take
the number three title home.

Bank was understandably
elated, especially about the semifi-
nal match. “That was one of the most
exciting matches I’ve ever been in-
volved in, and probably the best of
the tournament. As captain and the
only senior on the team, winning an
individual title was a great way to
finish my Bucknell career. And with
only myself graduating this year,
Bucknell should have a good chance
to be successful next year as well. I
was just glad to be around to be a
part of Bucknell’s first Patriot
League Championship.”

Stenstrém was equally as ex-
cited, saying, “I was extremely
happy to be able to grant Scott this
Patriot League doubles victory in his
last year on the team.” He continued,
“It is a great feeling to win, but vic-
tory is particularly sweet when
coming unexpectedly. None of us
thought that we would stand a
chance at winning when we arrived
at Colgate o1: Friday. However, the
team really pulied through with ev-
eryone playing well.

“Emotional support from the
team played a vital role in each and
every match, especially that which
came from Greg ‘Father’ Downing
[’941, who let his voice be heard af-
ter nearly every point. We should be
proud of our achievement, but a lot
of work needs to be done in order for
us to be a contender once again next
year.”

Friday saw the Bison warming
up for the championships with a
shortened-format dual match versus

Last weekend, the Bucknell
women’s polo team hosted the East-
em Collegiate Water Polo Tourna-
mentat Freas-Rooke Pool. Bucknell,
Harvard, MIT, Slippery Rock, and
the University of Maryland com-
peted for the Eastern championship
title. Bucknell starters for the week-
end were Banashek, Gorman, Susan
Hollinshead °91, Lammey, Kadi
Miller °91 Nielson, and Jen Reeb
’92. Bell was a back-up player due
to illness. Bucknell placed second
behind nationally ranked Slippery
Rock; the team took games 10-4
against Maryland, 8-6 against
Harvard, and 11-3 against MIT.
Their only loss came at the hands of
Slippery Rock, 16-3.

Gorman scored an incredible
20 of Bucknell’s 32 goals on the
weekend to earn her a spot on the
All-Tournament First Team along
with teammate Elaine Lammey and
co-MVP of the tournament, a title
that she shared with Slippery Rock’s
Leslie Kerfoot. Kerfoot is a National
teammate of Gorman’s.

Other scorers for Bucknell on
the weekend were Nielson (4),
Banashek (3), Bell (1), Suzanne
DiLenge ’94 (1), Heather Kelly ’91
(1), Miller (1), and Reeb (1).
Banashek and Nielson also shared
All-Tournament Second Team hon-
ors.

Bucknell’s second place finish
at Easterns earned the team a spot at
Outdoor Collegiate Senior Nationals
in San Diego, where it is seeded
sixth of U.C. Berkeley and the Uni-
versity of Michigan. Slippery Rock
goes into Nationals seeded third.
Cautilli says, “We wouldn’t be go-
ing to California without Vicki.
She’s a terrific hole-set [the integral
position for team success] and led
our team not only in scoring this
weekend, but in defensive steals and
assists as well.” The Bucknell team
is scheduled to leave for California
on May 17th.

Andrew Cantor ’92 warms up for his third singles match. Cantor won
the Patriot League title at that position.

tournament host Colgate. This
match, in which the singles contests
were ten-game pro sets and doubles
decided in eight game pro sets,
proved to be a surprisingly lopsided
6-3 Bison victory, most notably with
a 5-1 Bison singles margin, and thus
a large confidence builder for the
weekend.

Reynolds didn’t expect the
five singles victories he got, and
called the match “a real shot in the
arm for the team. It gave us the con-
fidence we needed to perform the
way we did over the weekend.”

And perform they did. Cantor
pointed out, “After a rocky first half
of the season, the team rose to the
occasion last weekend. Every mem-
ber on the team had excellent indi-
vidual performances. Tenacity was
in the hands and feet of every team
member, and this extreme devotion
earned us the title.” Indeed,
Reynolds was hard pressed to
choose one match as decisive or in-
dicative of the tournament, noting

that “even the weaker teams like
Fordham or Holy Cross have some
excellent individual players. And
one of the things that really helped
our cause, in addition to our play,
was the fact some of these players
upset favored Army players in early
rounds.”

He mainly wants to emphasize
that the victory was truly a team ef-
fort. The four-point margin of vic-
tory Over runners-up Army and
Colgate reflects only one of the four
point turnarounds of which Bucknell
had so many during the weekend.
Losing any one of those matches
would have put Army right in the
thick of things with the Bison.
Reynolds says, “Most of all, I’m just
delighted for the players. To have
won the final ECC Championship
last year and come back this year to
prove themselves again as the first
Patriot League champs really speaks
volumes about this team. They’ve
got so much to be proud of, and I
couldn’t be happier for them.”

The womens’ lacrosse team
dropped to 4-12 as it lost to the
University of Maryland at Baltimore
County, 11-10, in perhaps the most
exciting game of the year. Accord-
ing to Head Coach Jennifer Averill,
“Hollywood couldn’t have written a
script for the outcome of yesterday’s
game.” The winning goal was scored
on the Bison with only twenty sec-

seconds

onds remaining in a contest that went
back and forth throughout.
Bucknell dominated the
midfield and attack, but were unable
to capitalize as they fell behind by
four goals early in the match before
battling back to tie the game at half-
time. Toward the end of the game
the Bison lost some of that edge and
were unable to keep their lead due to
sloppy play and lack of patience.
The Bison were led offen-
