Tony Has Arrived!

Captain Tony Slate, head of
Bucknell’s Thundering Herd, re-
ported to training quarters unex-
pectedly, yesterday morning.

Tony was not expected in camp
until Monday or Tuesday morning,
but his sudden early release from
the hospital to which he was con-
fined because of his leg injury in-
curred in a railroad accident, re-
sulted in his taking the first train
for Lewisburg.

When _ interviewed yesterday,
Tony said that he was in tiptop
shape physically except for his leg
injury, which he must continue to
favor for a number of weeks.

“With any break at all, 1 hope
to ibe ready to play in the Temple

coms along as it has been doing
the last week.”

And so the Bisons have regained

strains or characteristics he is able
to point out to science just where in
the chromosome—the microscopic de-

given characteristic.

“No one has yet reported this dis-
covery,” said Dr. Eyster. He pointed
out that the new findings were of ex-

applieable throughout the whole field
of genetics. Their influence on plant
and animal raising can not be esti-

As the interviewer walked through
the field with Professor Eyster he
saw an amazing variety of corn. In

seme plants the leaves shoot up par- y

tend outward. Some leaves are thin
and narrow; others, broad, thick, and
leathery. In size they range from
dwarfs to giants.

One whole row is devoted to the
development of a practical agrica!-
tural plant. Here stands a line of
broadleaved, healthy stalks, most of
them bearing two plump ears. This
strain, developed from a small inbred
plant and a normal plant, can stand
against the forces of extended

New Air Thru Gift

Board Of or Donates
$500 For Alterations
And Repairs

New furnishings, pictures, books,
magazines, games — pleasant  sur-
roundings, in brief—are to be enjoyed
in the rejuvenated “Y” room on the
first floor of West College. A Com-
meneement Week gift of $500 to the
“Y” by the Board of Trustees at the
instigation of Prof, Frank EB. Burpee
has made possible the improvements.

Freshly painted and newly furnish-

ied, the “Y" room has assumed that

intangible thing called atmosphere.
A small library consisting of about 60
magazines, books and pamphlets will
be available for the use of the stu-
dents. — Facilities for various indoor
sports such as studying, checkers, and
chess are in the “Y” room. Nature,
in the ghise of beautiful pietures,
smiles down from what used to be
the bare wall, What a whale of a
ditference a few dollars make!

Buys Ist Air Ticket ~ — a

John A, Younghusband, '33, of San
Bernardino, California, purchased the
first rail-airplane ticket sold on the
Williamsport Division of the Pennsyl-
vanla Railroad, last June when he de-
parted for home after completing his
studies here.

Younghusband took a sleeper out
of Harrisburg, Tuesday evening, June
10, arriving in Columbus, Ohio, the
next day. He there changed to a
transport plane, in which he flew until
nightfall Wednesday, to Wyanoka,
Arkansas,

At Wyanoka, Younghusband chang-
ed to a sleeper on a Santa Fe train,
whieh took him to Colvis, New Mexico,
where he changed to another trans-
port plAne which conveyed him to
Los Angeles, arriving there Thursday
evening.

The trip consumed slightly less
than forty-eight hours, which js in
marked contrast to the four and one-
half days required by the fastest ex-
press train,

THE FLYING REPORTER
(by Lewis Edwin Theiss)

Dr. Lewis FE. Theiss, of the Eng-
lish department at Bueknell Univers-
ity, has seored another triumph in
boys’ adventure writing in “The Fly-
ing Reporter,” his latest book, which
has just come off the presses.

In this story of high-powered avia-
tion-newspaper adventure, Dr. Theiss
takes his hero-reporter through nu-
merous adventures, ranging from
parachute leaps to piloting a bootleg.
ger into Canada, and he does this im|
a manner that holds one’s interest |
throughout. ’

Believing in the adage that “truth
is stranger than ficton,” Dr. Theiss
has woven his story by piecing to-
gether real happenings that have be-
fullen flying reporters throughout the |
land. Every one of the high notes in
the story is vouehed for by the au:

registration are as follows: (1) to|
obviate the large amount of change
in registration which was encouraged
by the old system; (2) to equalize
sections, so far as possible, in ad-
vanee; (3) to place responsibility for
supervising and advising regarding
the planning of students’ programs
more definitely in the hands of the
major departments; (4) to establish
with the students contacts which may
form the basis of some advisory work
—formal or informa).

Freshmen will register Monday. In
the Tuesday forenoon, the sophomore,
junior, and senior Bachelor of Science
students will register and on Tuesday
afternoon the Bachelor of Arts stu-
dents will register. The upperelass-
men arranged a tentative schedule last
spring, so that final registration will
be quickly completed. Changes in
the schedules may be made only with
the consent of the advisors

J. H. MILLER IS
NEW FROSH DEAN

(Continued from Page 1.)
Harry Emerson Fosdick. Besides be-
ing dean of freshmen, Professor Mil
Ter will teach six hours of elementary
psychology.

An insight Into the scope of Dean
Miller’s work was given in an inter-
view, when he said: “At present my
purpose is to get before the students.
Tam going to place special emphasis
on personal contact, with the idea of
helping freshmen work out their
moral, religious, and scholastic prob-
Yems and in building a philosophy
that will guide them through their
life on the,eampus of Bucknell.”

Dean Miller has no disciplinary
functions and only incidental adminis-
trative functions. He is to work in|
full cooperation with the present ad-
ministrative foree, As yet no definite
organization of his department has
been completed. To carry out his |
purpose, which has been stated ahove, |
Dean Miller plans to organize two |
committees, one of the faculty and
one of the freshmen,

The faculty committee is to went
with him in forming a more =|
relationship ‘between students and
professors. This’ fact’ Dean Miller |
thinks is very important. Professors
do not always understand students |
and the students do not always under-
stand professors.

The freshmen committee is to be|
composed of 20 or 25 outstanding

~ Each of these
is to be the head of a.group of 10 or
12 freshmen. When a member of a
class is wanted for conference on
scholastic matter or anything else, |
the committee will be called and the
head of the group of which the want. |
ed student is a member will be told
and held responsible for the appear- |
anee of the person wanted. In this
way Dean Miller hopes to show the
elass that the group is responsible for
the actions of the individual and that
the individual is responsible for the!
showing of the class.

After diseussing this plan Dean|
Miller said: “This will be no single
track affair.”

It is hoped by the Dean that this
system will establish a medium for |
the students who are in Bneknell for
all play and no work, and those that |
are here for all work and no play. |
According to Dean Miller one of these
is Aas wrong as the other,

The office for the new Dean is in
Old Main. The room is being re-
modeled nod will be ready by next
week. He plans to hold a personal

conference with each freshman. j

were the important officers of the wo-

“Bobbie” explaining the qutet hour
maintained at the “Sem,” the hour at
which freshmen women must be in
their dormitory at night (ten o'clock),
and the ruling that forbids women to
smoke on the campus.

“Ginny” drew the attention of the
freshmen to the “¥" room in Buck-
nell Cottage which is at their dis-
vosal. She also asked the freshmen
to feel free to eome to her when ever
they felt the need of asking advice
or help. She extended this invitation
on behalf of the Y. W. C. A. cabinet.

The meeting closed with short talks
by Miss Roberta J. Melcher, director
of physieal education for women, and
Miss Sylvia Derr, assistant director.
They urged the freshmen to interest
themselves in athletics.

B.U. Chemistry Dept.
Installs New Lab
For Pre-Medicals

Prof. Groner’s Pre-Med Class /
To Use Third Floor Hall

The chemistry department of Buck-
nell has installed a new laboratory
in the chemistry building. During
the summer workmen under the di-

| rection of Prof. Frank E. Burpee have

made the south room on the third

floor of the ehemistry building into a
very neat and attractive laboratory. -
Space and equipment have been pro-
vided for about thirty students: The
desks, which were made by Prof. Bur-
pee’s men, have stone tops, drawers
for individual apparatus, gas taps,
and eleetric plugs. There are two
small elosets in the reom for equip-
ment and there is also a “dark room.”
The new laboratory will be used by
Prof. Groner's class in physical ehem-
istry which is made up of pre-mec'i-
cal students. The chemical engineers
have a laboratory for physical chem-
istry in the basement of the building.
The store rooms of the chemistry
department are being stocked for the |
new term. The order of supplies |
made this summer amounted to $2000.
This is only a part of what will be|
needed for the year, Last year over
$7000 worth of supplies were use,
The expenditure for supplies is cover-
ed by laboratory fees that are ecol- |

leeted from the students when they \.¢ any time and to confer with them. |

in the church of their affiliation. Dean
tivenburg briefly urged his audience
“to ally itself with the church.” Dean
Amelia E. Clark also spoke briefly.

The former pastor of the Baptist
Church, Dr. John T. Judd, treasurer
of the University Board of Trustees,
wished the elass all success. He said,
“This is the forty-sixth class I have
seen enter Bucknell.”

Dr. W. G. Owens, superintendent
of the Sunday School, reminded his
hearers that in this age science and
religion have fused, that the best
scientists are those who appreciate
their religion the most.

President Emory W. Hunt drew a
parallel between the erosion of a rock
constantly washed by water and the
effect college life has upon some
freshmen, He warned the incoming
lass against any undermining in-
fluences, reminding them that the
ehurch stands ready to help them.

Over 135 freshmen were present at
the reception of the Methodist Epis-
copal Church. The Alma Mater was
sung with “Bob” Cohen as piano ae-
companist. Various games followed;
after which Rey. Lester A. Welliver,
pastor of the church, made a short
weleoming address. Mr. H. M. Sho-
walter also spoke.

The reception of St. John's Reform-

were welcomed by Rev. and Mrs. H.

place of interest. Leaves wholly yel-
low, striped with yellow, mottled with
yellow; stalks of purple, ribs of
brown, green, and white are only a
part of the bizarre array to be found
in the leld. Many of these traits have
been linked definitely with other char-
acteristics and tracked to their pecu-

Professor Myster has been collect-

have personality somewhat tempered
by socio! contacts. “It is good to be
brought up in a big body of students,”
he said. “One enn’'t afford to hide
himself and to avoid student life.”

“We have an opportunity here to
show our taste—in selection of our
inspiration. We can determine
whether our inspiration is to uplift us
or drag us down.”

In closing he repeated his weleome:

Bisons Meet

Temple Owls
In Night Tilt

First Important Game
Scheduled For Owl
Field In Phila.

STATE, W. & J. FORDHAM,
TO BE MET IN NOVEMBER

The first major night contest to be
played in the Kast, will take phice in
Philadelphia, Fridny evening, October
10, when the Bisons tangle with the
Temple Owls. ‘The game, originally
scheduled for the next afternoon, was
set forward late in August, when the
Yemple athletic authorities decided te
try out night football.

The Temple game will be the first
major game of the year for the
Bisons, and will also take the Snavely-
men to a foreign field for the first
time. The first two games, Geneva,
on September 27, and Albright, on
October 4, will be phiyed in the Me-
moria]l Stadium.

Following the game in Philadelphia,
the Bisons return home the next Sat-
urday to tangle with St. Thomas C ol-
lege, from Scranton, and then migrate
to Gettysburg, where the Battlefie%
lads will be the opponents the follow
ing week-end,

Homecoming Day will take on add-
ed color, when the Bisons will try t
see which jinx remains supreme in
their tilt against Penn State on No
vember 1. For the last three years
the Lions have found bad luck in the
Bisons, while, on the other hand
Bucknell has never been able to win a
Homeeoming Day game in the Sta
dium.

The annual tussle with Villanova
will take the Main Liners and t
Bisons to Scranton on November §&
where Brooks Field will see anothe

scene in what has become the classi
of the onthracite coal regions.

Washington and Jefferson will try
to keep its string of victories intact

the day before the Homecoming Day

game with Penn State. The date for |

the opening of the course will be de-
finitely decided at a meeting of the
cominittee this week.

Professor James P. Whyte, of the
committee in charge, had «a represen-
tative of the Bueknellian over the
course yesterday, and pointed out the
work that had been done this sum-
mer towards completing the first nine
holes on the eighty-five acre plot of
ground of the old Keiser farm.

Every one of the greens was care-
fully seeded in May and June, with
specia) German Bent seed grass, one
of the most expensive varieties on the
market. By constant care and water-
jing throughout the protracted sum-
mer drought, the greens now appear
in perfect condition, There are no
rough or irregular spots to mar the
splendid condition of the land.

Falrways Nearly Ready

Professor Frank EK. Burpee, who is
in charge of the workmen engaged on
the course, is bringing the work on
the fairways to a close, and in a few
weeks the fairways will be in first
class condition.

A practice putting green has been
placed near the Keiser homestead,
while u practice driving green has
also been graded some hundred yards
away. This practice tee will not In-
terfere with golfers playing on the
course.

Prof. Whyte also pointed out that
golf is one of the few games that
practically anyone can play. “Besides
furnishing light exereise, the game
enables one to thoroughly enjoy the
Icisure time that comes one's way
when he has reached middle age,” he
faid.

Membership Inereasing

The list of members belonging to
the club has already passeil the hun-
dred mark with quite a number being
expected from the incoming freshmen
students, who will have the benefit of
their entire four years on the course.

The membership list of the eluh
now includes the following men and
women:

Ralpb Ammerman, J. W. Arbogast,
W. Neil Baker, Thomas J. Baldridge,

Some universities have plenty of

In such institutions the  lineman's
main job, we suppose, is to figure out
which coach Is who and why.

Fortunately Bucknell has had no
such problems — four couches—two

ball players.

modern baseball fan may at once
think of Lou Gehrig, of the Yankces,
or of Eddie Morgan, of the Cleveland
Indians, but Bucknellians’ memories
revert to the figure of her greatest
athletic star, “Christy” Mathewson.

Mr. Banta writes fittingly, “Strictly

that larruping line of '29.

And then there's freddie Locke, the

whose main Joh is to keep the water
bucket filed to overflowing.

Otty Nied, at 235, is the heaviest
man oon the squad, while the famed
“Ikey" Schafer at 152 is counted on
to terrorize the opposition.

the initials of hundreds of illustrious
predecessors and scarred with the
burns of innumerahle cigarettes as it

of consideration for the departed

civilization.

REGISTRATION
SAYS DR. H. W. ROBBINS

“Registration showed a bigger im-
provement this year over
ous year,” Dr. Ilarry W. Robbins said
today. The accuracy and speed with
which the lists of students were
handled was marred by but one dif-
fieulty, that, the frequency with which
students «decide to change their
courses, not only during registration,
but even after registration.”

A Better Band -

A sound financial condition of stu-
dent organizations was indicated by
the tenth annual issue of the “Report
of Distribution of Student Budget and
of Student Organizations of Bucknell
University” which released among the
faculty last Saturday. Vrofessor M.
L. Drum, trustee for the student or-
ganization, is director of the publica-
tion.

The report gives a detailed account
of the expenditure of the student fees
collected by the University for the
budget ticket. Of the fees collected,
Registrar H. W. Holter, pays treas-
urer Drum four dollars per student
each semester for the student organi-
zation. The women of the college pay
an additional dollar dues for the Wo-
men’s Student Government Associa-
tion.

The supervision of the students or.
ganization was credited with a bal
ance of $1037.58 on June 30, while
the Bucknellian had more than hal
that amount with $671.55. Only one
organization, Theta Alpha Phi ha
any unpaid debts. The dramatic fra-
ternity had a debt of $20, owed t

Starting next Monday, motor abil-

present sophomores’ records will be
checked with those of last year and
the results will be posted.

Physical education is required for
the first two years. This year no
doctor’s excuses will be accepted.
Should any upperelassman fail to
have her required amount of gym,
she may be allowed to complete her
requirements in the last two years.

New equipment, such as a buck, a
take-off board, hockey sticks and balls,
are supposed to arrive in time for the

THE INANE CODE
We are heartily in aceord with the
ideas expressed in the two letters to
the editor printed on this page. We
have previously «deplored the asininity
of freshman rules, and we shall con-
tinue to do so,

smoking

To the freshman who ha
the.nom de plume of leo Wendell
Daviier, we extend our sympathy.
*ife for a frosh is necessarily difficult,
and to add the burden of silly and
childish rules indicates a lack of good
sense and good breeding.

The president of Senior Tribunal
has indicated that no meetings of that
body will be held until October, when
men’s rushing will have been conclud-
ed. We do not need to seek far for
a reason for this action. The frosh
who is summoned before Senior Tri-
bunal after having violated the inane
code, loses his respect both for the
man_who reported him and the man
whom paddled him. Fraternity rush-
ing is bound to suffer if violators are
punished—therefore no meetings!

issumed

The senior who signs himself “An
Abolitionist” has pointed out another
phase of the question which has eome
in for little consideration thus far. It
is true that freshman men and women
were brought together as much as
possible during Freshman Week, and
that now the new men may not date
the women except in the presence of
ar upperclassman. It is true also
that the men of 1934 are eager, and
determined to “fuss.”

Since it is impossible for these
men to date “Sem” girls except in
the presence of another couple, they
resort to bumming to either Milton or
Sunbury for their dates.

The anti-fussing rule does not pre-
vent freshmen from dating. It mere-
ly forces them to go out of town for
their friendships with the opposite
BPX,

We hear much about the importance
of an all-around education, yet we ex-
pect our freshmen to forget ~~
Rirls until they are sophomores. ey
expect them to be elevated by al
rules that can contribute nothing to
their education. This is college!

THE BIG PARADE

The initiative shown by the Buck-
nell faculty in awarding the honorary
degree of Doctor of Literature to Dr.
George Dayton Strayer at Convoca-
tion deserves much commendation.
Never before in the history of the
University has Bucknell awarded an
honorary degree at Convocation.

This action marks a forward step
in the progress of the University.
Bucknell has followed the example of
the larger universities which some-
times amnunce a special Convocation

At the warm and sudden tangency of |

And disappear with poignant swift-

Breaks upon the consciousness

With searing force,

Like white-hot flames upon the flesh,

Although the burning pain will cease,

The withered scar

Forever flaunts itself before forget

And sharpened claws
Is often with me.
Sometimes

Dig deep into the very center of my

Sometimes
Ilis large, black orbs
Gaze into mine with sadness and re-
morse,
He chases me when | am all alone.
He follows me;
T sense his presence,
Yet I fear to look behind.
Only I can feel
His panting breath
Upon my cheek
As he passes by.

You hold for me the deadly charm
Of sleek green apples.

Psychologically Writing

To The Editor:

On Wednesday last, when a fresh-
man ceased to be an independent jn-
dividual and beeame a commodity for
the humor of the more dignified class-
mien, it occurred to me that irony
played more of a part than on pre-
vious occasions of this reversion to
the primitive,

It is lamentable enough that young
men and women who have come to
eollege in an effort to submerge that
high school complex, should meet cus-
toms that are reminiscent. But that
these same men and women should be
made the vietims of a psychological
“faux pas” is an error that should
be rectified, in order that the powers
that be may at least seem consistent.

I] speak of the fussing rule which
was imposed upon freshmen follow-
ing a gala week in which fussing was
encouraged to the extent that the men
|and women dined, danced, and enjoy-
ed themselves together without re-
serve. Why were these people brought
together during Freshman Week if
not to become acquainted with one
another? And if that was the pur-
pose, why are they barred from con-
tinuing those acquaintances now?
These measures serve cross purposes,
and one defeats the other. Why not
be consistent ? .

Neither should the fact be neglected
that these young people need social
contacts with the opposite sex just as
do other college classes. It is too
late to deny them these contacts, for
they have already become sex-con-
scious. Doesn’t this warrent a fare-
well to anti-fussing?

Dr. Strayer's

address in part fol-

GULLAVE A's
GAOBYLES

An applicant for admission to one
of our Kastern colleges, let us say
Bucknell University, a boy sixteen
years of age, gave as his reason for

desiring to enter the college the fact
that, in his- judgment, the hest men
of his community were graduates of
the institution and that he felt that
these graduates were men of indomit-
able spirit. Using the boy's words,
he said: “Ll wish to enter Bucknell
University because the dest men in
my community are Bucknell graduates
and because of the indomitable spirit
of Bucknell men.”

I wonder whether any philosopher
could have given a better reason for
the choice of a college than did this
sixteen-year-old boy? Surely prepa-

ration for a worth while life can best
be accomplished by association with
men of high ideals. If an institution
is properly characterized in the life
and work of its alumni as one that
has turned out the best men, it is a
splendid place for a young man to
spend the most important four years
of his life. If going to college de-
velops a spirit which will not admit
of failure, the time devoted to a col-
lege education has been most profit-
ably spent.

I know that I express the ideals of
this institution when 1 propose to all
of you who are ‘assembled today for
the beginning of a new year’s work
that those responsible for your work
here desire for you that achievement
which will lead inevitably to the plac-

FRESHMAN POLL

Simulating the Literary Digest,
Gulliver wasted the whole of Fresh-
man Week in the throes of a straw
vote. Feeling that things in general
are always open to improvement, he
spent several hours in the arms of
Morpheus and was rewarded with a
glittering dream of the
Week ideal,

Awakening enthusiastic, he plunged
forth with a bewildering ballot. Every
Freshman was privately approached
at the end of each day of Freshman
Week and asked what, in the light of
his experience, he would have liked
best on that day. The results were
surprising enough and are here pub-
lished In the hope that the proper
authorities will notice them,

say with all sincerity that the “Buck-
nellian” far exceeded my expectations.
It is so well-written in its every fea-
ture and its humor is so laugh-pro-
veking that ! made a friend of it

as can easily be discerned from the

Such a paper has much more free-

more courage than «a high = school

at the high schoo] we would have
been sorely and severely reprimanded
for the publication of anything at all
against the school system and its au-
thority. But I was more pleased with
than surprised at your platform. You
certainly have great possibilities; you
are cognizant of them, and you are
making use of them,

Perhaps you might be interested in
the point of view of a frosh regard-
ing freshman rules. Well here goes:

and to be 'bossed about by a crowd of
wild, hectic hoodlums. My purpose is

of this unnecessary soph silliness does
rot aid or add one iota to my advance-

For some reason or other, the col-

Well, from my own introspections, I

be willing to work with others for the

search for truth may conceivably be
a very selfish one. It is only as one

society. We cannot rest satisfied
with a situation in which large groups
of men are unemployed because of
waves of prosperity and depression
in business. We cannot continue to
tolerate a situation in which honest
and industrious men and women find
themselves herded into poorhouses

examine and to reconstruct the eco-
nomic situation which exploits the
majority of the members of the com-
munity in order that a few may en-
joy great wealth.

Delta Eta Chi was organized in

guidance of President Emory W.

men met to form their own fraternity.
At the beginning of the last school
year, the group moved into the fra-

NEW CHAPTER HOUSE TO
ACCOMMODATE THIRTY

For the first time in the history of
the sehool, an organized Jewish fra-
ternity, Tau Epsilon Delta, will have
a place on the roll of fraternities
having houses at Bucknell. The house
oceupied by Tau Epsilon Delta is the
old Beta Kappa house, located at 41
Market street.

At present the new fraternity has
19 uctive members and two pledges,
with 18 of the active members living
at the house. Tau Epsilon Delta is a
local fraternity, but negotiations are
under way for petitioning a national
organization, and the officers are very
hopeful that this may be accomplish-
ed during the present year. The of-
ficers of Tau Epsilon Delta are:
President, Bert Cohen, ’32; Vice Presi-
dent, Nate Glazier, ‘32; Treasurer,
Sam Stern, 732, and Secretary, Dan
Solomon, ’32.

The house can accommodate 30 men,
but the number living there has been
limited to 18 in order to avoid crowd-
ing. Only two rooms have more than
two men in them. As yet, no meals
have been served by the fraternity
but at the beginning of next week the
members will eat at the house.

“Slim” Mezza, giant fullback, had
his nose crushed in scrimmage this

out of the game. “Tom” Cummings

injuries while Warren McClain and
“Beany” Martin are out of the daily
drills with a sprained ankle and torn
shoulder ligaments, respectively.

Directors Plant and Musser will be
able to center their attention on the
still very large group of underde-
veloped sophomores and the freshmen.

series includes work with posture,

According to the Philadelphia In-

Temple team is now capable of doing
things that the 1929 Temple eleven
could not perform until the very end
of the season.

Temple has a husky bunch of will-

coaching staff is expecting big things.
Thus far in practice at Ocean City,
N. J., four sophomore backs, Zahnow,
Zareck, Kilkuskie and Whittock, have
been showing up particularly well.
Carl Ruben, a sophomore taekle, is
also regarded highly.

Heinie Miller, former Penn lumi-
nary, is head coach of the Quaker

all former Penn stars, and John “Ox”

in getting off his kicks than either

sented conclusive evidence
the bottle tops as sources of contami-
nation.

As his work attracted widespread
notice and respect it won the support
ot a manufacturer whose patents are
of great importance to the cap indus-
try. This man has materially aided
the research through the exertion of
| his influence. :

Uncut Specimens Examined

Believing that contamination of the
fibre took place before the raw card-
board was manufactured into bottle
tops, the Bucknell bacteriologist ex-
amined uneut specimens of the paper,
finding his suspicions well founded.
This discovery suggested that since
ull paper food containers were prob-
ibly similarly tainted, a revision of
prevailing methods of paper making
was highly desirable.

To confirm his opinions, Dr. Rice
visited the plants of two paper com- |
panies in different parts of the East.
With officials of the companies co-
operating, he was able to take test
materials which revealed Jater that,
while a steaming process tended to

terilize the contaminated wood pulp

early in the process, a later smooth- |
ing action using polluted water, tatnt-
“4 the finished product.

While Dr. Rice has not yet com- |

all the data so far collected, his find-
ings show a definite commercial trend |
in the manufacture of paper that is a |
great potential menace to the health
of the nation. The interest of the
manufacturers already interviewed, |
however, suggests their willingness |
to conform to standards of sanita- |
tion.

Dr. George Stewart
Forcefully Censures
Compulsory Chapel

Internationalist And Educator
Upholds Idea of Voluntary »
Chapel Services Only

VIEWS ARE EXPRESSED
AT FACULTY LUNCHEON

“The students are right in re-
belling against compulsory}
chapel: there would be no hope if |
they didn’t.” said Dr. George R.}
Stewart, one of the forentost stu- |
dents of the college chapel prob-
lem, at the faculty Iuneheon held
in his honor Tuesday noon.

As a number of the faculty vigor- |
ously nodded their approval, the noted
internationalist outlined the faults of
the compulsory chapel service which
he called a “national college problem.

“Only a few colleges,” he declared,
“among them Yale, Prineeton, Chi-
cago, and a few Episcopal and Luth-
eran schools, are making any serious,
intelligent efforts to satisfy the pres-
ent needs.”

Mentioning Commencement Hall, he
pointed out how the old room, scene |
of pep meetings, examinations, and
heterogeneous assemblies, was totally
wanting in the atmosphere needed for
rligious services. He reminded the
assembly that the aesthetic appreeia- |
tion of the student is harshly jolted |
hy the ill-suited setting of the chapel
fervices,

Dr. Stewart had previously spoken
at the combined chapel services in|
Commencement Tlall Tuesday morn
ing.

Mast Be Voluntary |

“Chapel services must be voluntary,
if they are to fulfill their purpose,”
insisted Dr. Stewart. “They must. be
conducted by persons eminently quali
fied for the position, not by the un-
suited individuals who quite generally
are responsible for the unpopularity
of the present services.

“The services must be ac stheticall y
satisfying. The introduction of lit
anies and liturgies can strengthen
this prase of ndvancement. Chapels
must be ethically arresting, and in
order to accomplish this we must have
a revision of the present coneept of
morals, standards, and new customs.” |

Glee Club Directors
Plan Innovations;
Frosh. Promising

The plans of Directors Grace Jen-
kins and Ralph Hartz for the coming
year in the men’s and women’s glee
clubs are extensive and include sev-

\eral innovations.

The new freshman material which
has been trying out for positions in
the clubs has proved quite adequate
for following the plans closely.

The men’s club held their first meet-
ing on Thursday evening in Bucknell
Hall, and work on an entirely new
program for the season was begun.
Director Hartz was engaged this sum-
mer in taking several courses in music
in order to widen his field of activity.
As a result he has arranged a pro-
gram of exceptional numbers.

Vacant positions are few because of
the fine return of the older men to
the club, but any student interested
in cultivating his voiee and touring
for Bucknell may try out with Diree-
tor Hartz in his studio at the School
of Music.

Two Extensive Trips

Extensive trips will be
Thanksgiving and Easter,
which will be extended to ten days.
Formerly the Thanksgiving -trip has
been only four or five days. The
men’s club will also enter the Inter-
collegiate Song Contest, and in addi-
tion there will be numerous short ex-
cursions.

The women are also planning to
make a number of short trips. This
ts a fresh idea, as the women’s glee
ciub has never attempted overnight
trips before. The great snecess for
the past two seasons of the combined
clubs has prompted a repetition of
that activity. Plans for this have
nlso grown in extent, and several pro-
grams are promised from this group

this seagon.

TIGER. TIGER,
(By Honore W. Morrow)
William Morrow & Company.

By Gladys Haase, '32
John Gough was one of the patron
saints of the temperance movement
of the nineteenth century.
Englishman, who, coming to America

He was an

when he was a boy, suffered great
hardships, took to drinking, and ex-
“perienced the utter degradation of a
drunken bum.

By his own sheer will, he dragged
himself from the clutches of the
Tiger (Aleohol) only to relapse into
its power twice again until he was
through with it.

He became famous in the United
States and England as a temperance
lecturer. John Gough seemed to be
one of those persons that have an in-
ner loadstone that attracts other
people to them. He began with the
idea that temperance was merely a
moral movement, one apart from any
religious influence. However, after
his relapse into the clutches of the
Tiger, he realizéd that something
more than just moral foree was nec-
essary to keep a man from the power
‘of aleohol. He became a stong sup-
porter of the religious temperance
movements, and also of the legal, the
prohibition movement.

Although. John Gough must have
been an interesting character, he does
not seem so in this book—in spite of

Will Parallel Coming Text
By the Same Author

A motley hoard of blood-thirsty o*
freshmen successfully vanquished a
rather small but valiant frroup of
sophomores last Saturday afternoon
at the annual revival of the tradition-
a! elass rush, held at Loomis Field.
; The affair, however, was far from be-
|ing an overwhelming victory for the
men of '34.

Plentifully smeared in their war-
paint of green Duco, the freshmen,
after assembling on the quadrangle,
marched down to the battlefield, loud-
ly demanding water as they did so.
| The soccer team was uneeremonjously
pushed out of the way and the eager
yearlings lined up opposite the Hill,
howling like a pack of
hyenas.

Most recent among the publications
for the Bucknell faculty members is
Professor William H. Eyster’s “Lab-
oratory Studies in General Botany,”
a laboratory manual issued from the
publishing house this week.

The manual, published by Edwards
| Brothers, Ine., of Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan, represents a new departure in
the teaching of general botany. De-
signed to give a complete unit each
semester, it will give the student who
takes « single semester’s work a com-
plete idea of the science. The second
emester's work will be occupied by a
letailed study of plant groups.

, Professor Eyster opens his book
with an exercise in microscopic work
following this with studies of types
of plant bodies and plant cytology.
Continuing he turns to physieal and
hemical processes and histology.
Later he examines the functions of
he stem and leaf, entering the more
mportant phases of metabolism and
of growth. An interesting exercise is
evoted to responses of plants to
timuli. A final stu y group hinges
on plant reproduction.

Dr. Eyster's laboratory manual has
een Written to parallel a textbook
mn which he is now working. He ex-
pects to finish the work within the
year. The book, now about half com-
pleted will have entirely original il-
lustrations. The drawings, executed
by Miriam Groner, are exceptionally
fine, combining accuracy and artistic
|taste. Photograph’s have been pre-
pared by Professors Davis and Eyster.

“THE PLAY’S THE THING”

Prospects are very bright for the
dramatic season at Bucknell this year.
At the combined meeting of Frill and
Frown, Cap and Dagger, and Theta
Alpha Phi, 58 students signed up for
try-outs for the technical and acting
staff.

These three organizations will not
suffer from a dearth of dramatists,
but they probably will suffer from the
lack of good directors.’ Assistant
Professor C. W. Smith has consented
te act as faculty advisor to the dra-
matic groups this year, but he can-
not be expected to assume the diree-
tion of all the plays that have been
scheduled for production.

Acting at Bucknell suffered a very
severe slump Jast year when an un-
usually small number of plays was
presented. It was evidently a case
of “the students were willing, but the
directors were not.”

We cannot blame our faculty mem-
bers for refusing to take up the ad-
ditional burden of producing student
plays. That task logically belongs to
the students, who, unfortunately, are
not now capable of doing so.

A course in dramatic production
seems to be the most probable solu-
tion to the difficulty. We feel confi-
dent that such a course would give

on their own plays, and would at the
same time relieve our hard-working
professors of a task that they ought
not be asked to undertake.

THE STUDENTS PAY

The announcement that the United
States Army Band has been secured
as the first feature on the Artist
Course will be received with approval
by the student body as a whole.

The members of the Artist Course
committee are coming more and more
to realize that the tastes of the stu-
dents should be considered before the
programs are scheduled.

This new attitude on the part of |
the committee was particularly ap-

presentation last year. The students
actually packed Commencement Hall
to hear Count Felix Von Luckner, a}
rare occurence in the history of =|
tertainment courses at Bucknell.

tion. /
Case 354

Van Sleek was really high class.
In 1927 he raked in a chilly million
selling beautifully engraved certifi-
cates for the Sap-Sueker Goldust
Company of Butte, Montana. Federal
investigation later revealed that the
company owned an acre of land near
Butte on which was erected one
shanty. Among the “stockholders”
were 34 widows, seven orphans, and
four college professors. In 1929 Van
Sleek replenished the bank accounts
of several judges, whom justice later
moved to dismiss proceedings against
him. In 1930 he made the little slip
of defying the Senate, when they
were investigating the inconsequential
problem of smuggling foreigners into
this country. He landed in the pen
here, and has requested that he be al-
lowed to teach economics at B. U.
His wife and two children intend to
move to this town, where they will
entertain college boys at the cocktail
hour each day.

“Bishop” Chaudaire was a respected
member of the highest councils of a
worthy ecclesiastical institution until

DR. STEWART VS. CHAPEL

Compulsory chapel—how
ous and distasteful those words have
become!—took n telling blow on the
jaw from Dr. George R. Stewart the
other day at a faculty luncheon when
he said, “Chapel services “ynust pe
if they are to fulfill their

purpose.”
smash was followed by a series of
hard body thrusts at vital spots, al-
ways keen, always well-timed, and we
have hopes that Old Man C. C. will
soon crumple to the floor for the long
count.

Dr. Stewart's candid words on the
very subject that has been wrangled
over for se long a time at Bucknell
was just the sort of thing this cam-
pus has heen needing—a disinterested
appraisal of the conditions that now
surround conpulsory chapel here,
conditions that have changed surpris-
ingly in the last generation.

Poorly conducted services, ranging
“am a pep meeting one session to a
mediocre evangelist the next, each
one grudgingly attended, held in halls
that are the butt of slighting remarks
from éveryone—such «are “chapel”
services at Bucknell.

Right now, at the start of a new
college year, is the time to make #
drastic change in the chapel program.
One suggestion that contains some
merit is that compulsory chapel be
dropped, and bi-weekly voluntary ser-
vices be held in Buckneli Hall, and
that that building be remodeled so
that it will be suitable for services
intended primarily for worship.

Jn order to save the little respect
for chapel that still exists here, that
suggestion ought to be given a trial.
Some other suggested changes may
be found better still, but the main

is, compulsory chapel must fade
out of the picture.

The committee now appreciates the |
fact that students will not attend an

The committee realizes, further-
more, that the students, and not the
committee members, pay for the pro-

speakers that appeal to et hen
but there is no reason why the tastes |

It is with this particular idea in|

are bringing the Army Band here Oc-

\ppeal, and the appearance of this |
purticular organization will doubtless

|be the biggest musical event of the|

season at Bucknell.

Sixty musicians make up the per-
sonnel of this famous “Cadet Grey”
organization which will play two con-
certs, one in the afternoon and one in
he evening.

Invitations wil] be sent to a number|
yt bands from surrounding tewns to
play one number at these concerts.
These visiting bandsmen will prob-
ably be invited to attend the game
with St. Thomas in the stadium on
the following day.

It is expected that hundreds of men
and women from this vicinity will
take ndvantage of this opportunity to
hear “Pershing’s Own,” the most
famous radio band in America.

Concept Of God

The real contribution of lrofessor
Horton is to be found in his last two
chapters in which he develops:a con-
cept of God by philosophical infer-
ence and empirical evidence derived
from social experience. He begins
with a number of tentative definitions
und hypotheses which may be veri-
fied or disproved in one's own experi-
enee. He finally concludes that the
God of ‘human experience “is a vast
cosmic drift or trend toward harmony,
fellowship, and mutual aid, whereby
cur efforts to create a just equilibriunt
in human affairs are supported and
maintained.” This, Professor Horton
maintains, is capable of social verifi-
cation,

From this point he goes on to draw
a very subtle and interesting com-
parison between the ubsolutistic God
of Baron von Hugel and the limited
God of G. A. Studdert-Kennedy. There
slowly emerges a new concept of God
ta meet the needs and challenges of
humanism and naturalisi.

others it is an agreeable nolse, or a

Many Spectators Gather To See
Embryo Firemen in Action;
Damage Very Slight

Shortly before 11 o'clock Monday

evening the long and persistent clang-
ing of the town firebell proclaimed a

fire. After due course of time the

truck was wheeled from its barracks

and all the fire eaters of the town
| and school followéd the trail of the |
| siren to what surely must be a con-

flagration rivalling some of the more
| historical blazes.

Lo and behold! The denizens of
the fire-fighting crew and its hopeful
followers halted at the new Kappa

But alas! Too lute. A crew of lusty
| Kappa Sigs led by Walter Dutchak,
| Arthur Gerhart, and Harold Noos, all
jof the elass of '32, fearful of having

their new domicile succumb to the
ravages of the flames, had already
erected a jadder to the second story
lavatory window. Then “Dutch,”
| whose trusty soupbone has so ably
guarded the left garden for Bucknell’s
baseball team, threw a brick through
the window.

“Artie,” disregarding damage to
sartorial perfection, raced up the lad-
der, reached through the hole made
by “Dutch’s” brick, unlatched the
window and stepped in. His gaping
fraternity brothers anxiously await-
ed his reappearance. And there he
was framed in the window with a
blazing oil-soaked rag held gingerly

The blaze was first noticed by
Charles Forman, living back of the
Kappa Sigma house on Brown Street.
He telephoned the alarm and notified
the Kappa Sigs at the May-Mar tea
room.

The fire was limited to the wash-
bowl in the lavatory and was caused
by a Inseed oil-soaked rag which had

sumption being that spontaneous com-
bustion started the fire. No damage
was done other than the broken win-

Hostility of Russia

Russians Hostile To Religion,
Stifle Individual Enterprise;
Country is Unhappy

“Russia is openly hostile to nine-
tenths of the things for which I would
die,” avowed Dr. George R. Stewart,
Tuesday evening at an open forum
in playroom of the new dormitory.

Characterizing the experiment of
the Soviets as a distressing failure,
he demonstrated the weakness of
their organization. A hundred per-
cent hostile to religion of every sort,
suppressing a democratic press, and
stifling individual) enterprise, the
country is, as a whole, decidedly un-
happy. The farmers, suspicious of
the machine government with its fatal
combination of firing squad and trac-
tor propaganda, are grudgingly sub-
mitting to their fate.

The soviet women, disillusioned of
their dreams of a greater freedom,
bear an even heavier burden of ma-
terial and mental woes. Civil war
has removed all vestiges of culture.
Only a theoretical advancement in
literary can be advanced to counter-
balance the aesthetic loss.

Expressing his sympathy for many
of the Soviet ideas, Dr. Stewart stated
that the government has employed
unjustifiable means and has, perhaps
consequently, failed to gain justifiable
ends. The five year plan he called an
experiment that has proved a most
expensive and unprofitable venture.

spectators colorfully garbed in pa-
jamas, robes and other modes of dress
witnessed the spectacle.

Friday night, Coach Howard Harpster
and his Geneva gridders will come to
Lewisburg primed to give the Bisons
a severe test in the opener of Buck-
nell's hard schedule.

Geneva will be no set-up. This
game will not be one of those tradi-

has moulded together a strong team to
test the metal of the Snavely ma-
chine.

Captain Johnny Knapic will lead the

Geneva eleven into action, Knapic is |

ne of the cleverest backs in Western
Pennsylvania and will have to be
watched closely. The rest of the
Beaver Falls backfield will also be
experienced. Joe Preece, Karl Ewing
and Alyman, a transfer from Ohio

Ransom and George Johnson are two
of the huskies on the line of whom
Harpster thinks highly.

Pi Sigma Alpha
To Pledge Men Soon

national honorary political science
fraternity which was installed at
Bucknell jast June, will hold pledging
for new members in the near future,
it was announced here today.

The officers elected at the initial

Rho chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha, |

tain Levine at tackle; Forrest McNeil
at end; Andy Cochrime at guard; and
Glenn Smith at halfback are the only
seniors likely to start. The remaind-
er of the varsity will probably be com-
posed of juniors

Three of the backfield are veterans
who played against the Bisons last
fall. “Maury” Rush, ‘Stew’ Wilson
and Johnny Butler are all back.
“Don” Lewis is the only man missing
from the flashy backfield which work-
ed havoe with the Bisons last year.
Smith, a senior, and Zagray, a sopho-
more, are battling for Lewis’ position
with Smith likely to start,

necessity for college training in the
shop, which he states is due to the
fact that they had to depend on ex-
perimental methods for their guid-
onee as there was little theory avail-
able for them to use. The amount of
theory needed for the engineer to
solve the problems with which he
comes in contact today has greatly
increased within the last few decades,

Looking at it from an educational
viewpoint, Mr. Garman thinks that
four school years is too short a time
to give the student the foundation he
should have in the theories. Students

not been closed by the Eighteenth
amendment ?

“What do they seck? © Temperance,
let us hope—not merely a statute.
Intemperance and crime are inundat-
ing us in spite of the statute. Are
they willing to let the flood rise?

“Was there ever a time in this
country’s long struggle for temper-

for a union of all people seriously in-

turn. Hard liquor as a_ beverage
should go. The criminal factory, |
which the lawless traffic (inevitable |
under prohibition) has set up, must
be razed. Obviously this means the |
repeal of the Eighteenth amendment,
though not until] a practical elie. |

Prohibitionists’ Work Clear

“Will the prohibitionist help in this
work? ‘Today he stands before a

years ago. He is regarded as in the
way of temperance. He has his chance
now as they did then. Unless he
takes heed, it will be swept out of his
reach. He will find himself with the
amendment repealed, no substitution

To Miss Tarbell the most alarming

the drinking of illicit liquor.

President Emory W. Hunt and John
T. Judd, a trustee of the University,
stated that they could not see that
such an institution would cast any
reflection on Bucknell University.

At present, the Reading Railroad
company is planning to lay a_ side
track, running from their main line
to the proposed location of the peni-
tentiary. The tract of land en which
the institution will be erected com-
prises 1000 acres of farm land, the
nearest point of which is two miles
northwest of Lewisburg. Hf the work
of surveying:and preliminary speci-
fications goes along unhindered, the
first building operations will take
place between November 15 and 380.

Among the prominent men who
were instrumental in locating the
penitentiary at Lewisburg were Chas.
R. Smith, editor and proprietor of the

Lewisburg Jgurnal; Federal Judge A.
|W. Johnson, of Lewisburg; Congress-
man Edward M. Beers, representing
the district in which Lewisburg is
located; Sanford Bates, director of

Bucknellians Serve .
As Radio Operators ©
During the Summer

S. Githens, ’31, and S. Windes, '33
Traveled Over 23,000 Miles

Two undergraduates assochited with
WJBU, the Bucknell] broadcasting sta-
tion, gained invaluable experience
when they served as radio operators
on the Great Lakes’ steamer “Juni-
ata,” during the summer. ‘The men
were Sherwood Githens, '31, who
served as Senior Radio Officer, and
Stephen Windes, '33, Junior Radio

Officer, both members of Alpha Chi!

Mu fraternity.

The “Juniata” is a first-class pas-
steamer, one of the best om
the lakes, which plies between Buf-

falo and Duluth. She is 360 feet long |

and carries a crew and passenger list
totaling more than 600 people.

Law requires steamers to have two
operators who work on six-hour
watches. Githens anid Windes were
two of the eight licensed men on the
crew.

During the three and a half months
they were on board they traveled
23,000 miles, touching at
all the big lake cities save Chiengo,
and sailing on all the lakes. Through-
out that time they maintained a radio
newspaper service such us that used
on the oce:n-going steamers.

Last year Githens was on the “Oc- | -

torara,’ a sister ship of the “Juniata,”
while the year before he was on the
“Tionesta.”

Ann Graybill Makes
Perfect Health Mark

Ann Graybill, ’33, made the first
perfect score in the health and motor-

ability tests made in the women’s
classes last week. Constance Barber,
33, made a score of nineteen, which
is regarded as an almost perfect rec-
ord, A feature of the tests was the
marked improvement of the sopho-
more class.
The health and motor-ability tests
were begun us an experiment last
year, the present sophomore class be-
ing given them for the first time. The
| perfect seore of 20 was not achieved
at that time. Ann Graybill made a
score of 14, and Constance Barber a
score of 13. The same tests are be-
ing given to the class of '34 and notes
will be compared for improvement.

both
ing scholastic achievement and prom-
ise of ability to do high
tigation work that they have
awarded scholarships by the Chemis-
try Club of New York.

The Bloede scholarship of $5.00,
donated by Victor G. Boede, of Car-
rol Station, Baltimore, Md., was held
by Mr. Andrus last year and wus con-
tinued for this year. This fund is
usually awarded only for the senior
year or for graduate work.

Mr. Nagel holds the Hoffman schol-
arship of $400 which was held last year
by Francis Meeker. These awards
are especially desirable because they
do not have to be repaid. Most free
gifts and scholarships require work
on some problem or are in the form
of a loan.

Lehigh University will no longer

PRESIDENT HUNT SPEAKS
AT FIRST Y. W. VESPERS

President Emory W. Hunt spoke om
the Twenty-third Psalm at the first
ly, W. C. A. vespers of this season
| which was held in the Larison Hall
|parlors. The meeting was unusually
| well attended. Margaret Cornely,
'33, played a prelude and postlude as
|a feature of the services.

A trio composed of Constance Wil-
liamson, °32, Ruth Baker, ‘33, and
Helen Butler, '33, sang specia] music.
| Virginia Cowell, ’31, president of the
Y. W. C. A. presided.

President Hunt said that people
brought up in the country, know about:
sheep, therefore they are the ones
who can best appreciate the shep-
herd’s care and the Twenty-third

Psalm,

“Since many of us have been
brought up in the city,” he said, “it
is difficult to realize what the ancient
psalmist meant in expressing a spirit-
ual significance in what to many of
us seems such strange figures.’’

President Hunt spoke especially of
one picture, “He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.” “That sort
of a sheep isn't hungry when he will
Jie down in a green pasture,” he said.
“What a picture of utter supply and
perfect content.”

“But another thing comes before,”
he continued, ‘“‘The Lord is my shep-
herd.’ The only safety for me is to
follow him. Other paths may seem
all right for a thme, but there is an-
other time coming when disillusion-
ment, disappointment, and final de-
feat are sure to follow. Before the
green pasture, comes the steady trust-
ful, obedient following of the shep-
herd.”

HERBERT WENNER, '33,

IN CRITICAL CONDITION

Herbert A. Wenner, '33, is in a cri-
tical condition at the Geisinger Me-
morial Hospital at Danville, where he
is suffering from an attack of peri-
tonitls,

Wenner was rushed to the hospital
Sunday evening by Dr. Lester P.
Fowle, University physician. Reports
from Danville today indicated that
Wenner is rallying "from his attack,
but has not yet been able to undergo

A WELCOME FEATURE

Mrs. Gifford Pinchot’s talk in the
‘South Seas" which will be given
n the Baptist Church here on Octob-
‘r 21 promises to be one of the fin-
pst features presented by the Camp-
us Civb in r ni year The officers
of the club who are responsible for
bringing Mrs. Pinchot here are to he
eongratulated for their selection

As the wife of the Republican nom-
nee for governor of Pennsylvania,
Mrs. Pinchot is naturally very much
in the lmelight. However, her ap-
péarance here will not be in the na-
ture of a campaign speech. Her talk
will be based on her recent trip to
the South Seas, and will be illustrat-
ed by moving pictures which she
has brought back with her. Those
persons who have heard her IWlustat-
ed talk are very enthusiastic about
her program. Bucknell is fortunate
in having her come to this campus.

ATHLETICS FOR ALL

Bucknell is making noteworthy
progress in its campaign for athletics
in some form for every student. Ac-
cording to a news story printed on
the sporting page, we notesthat 61
freshmen have signed up for track.
On another page we read that 36
mer. have entered the annual fall
tennis tournament,

Soccer for girls will be introduced
this fall. Tennis, hockey, riding, and
field sports are already on the fall
Sports program for coeds.

A front page story indicates that
inter-fraternity soccer at Bucknell
will have to be dropped unless a
playing field is made available. In
the interests of athletics for all stu-
dents, it {s sincerely hoped that the
Greek letter sport will not be dis-

.| cheer or need of it when they learned

that this freshman chapel was div-
erted by a body called the Freshman
Choir.

Sadie took music lessions at home
| and Joe was in the high school glee
| club. According to every story they
had ever heard, a choir sings. With
their natural musical learnings they
decided to sing in this choir if given
| the opportunity. At first meeting of |
‘the chapel, some twenty-four or so
| freshmen trooped to the platform up-
‘on request and seated themselves. Joe
and Sadie are among them. They ex-
| pected to sing. (Ha. Ha. Sing special
| things.) They ntver did. They merely

favorite joke at Bucknell. The choir
that never sings!

Why don't the members of this
choir sing? We take it for granted
that they have the ability or they
wouldn't have the temerity to offer
| themselves as a holocaust. They are
unable. to lift their voices on high

given sufficient encouragement. Us-
ually some mention of practices is
made but nothing ever materializes.
Why not? Because freshmen are too
unfamiliar with their surroundings to
organize without some strong leader-
ship,

During the past, the Freshman
Choir has merely provided the other
freshmen with something to look at
during the chapel period, That has
never been announced as its purpose.
Why not a living organization?

“GREEN PASTURES"

By Prof. Chas. M. Bond
For the past six months my friends
have been saying to me, “It’s a great
play. You must see it.” Mare Con-

‘nelly’s “Green Pastures,” the Pulitzer

Prize Play for 1930, is far more than
these friends of mine have claimed
for it. As 1] sat through the rapidly
shifting scenes of this humorous, yet
tragic, negro interpretation of a great
racial epic, I'thought of the words of
Professor HK. A, Steiner, of Grinell,
who wrote, “I” went to /Oberaummer-
gau to find God and IT found a show
l came to New York to see a show and
I found God.” | cannot understand
the first half of this rémark, ‘but af-
ter my experience in the Mansfield
Theatre 1 can understand and endorse
the second half of this statement,

To undertake to report the lines or
the details of the high spots of the
play, would nnake a gripping soul
drama seem ridiculous. As one re-
gards the book or hears the play re-
ported he is apt-to say, “How absurd,”
or “How irreverent!” Bnt when*he
has before him the performances of
Richard B. Harrison, Daniel L.
Haynes, Wesley Hill, Tutt Wetney,
and the other members of the east,
one is aware of no irreverence. Not
even when Gabriel offers the Lord a
“ten-cent seegar.”

Has Wholesome Humor

There is plenty of humor in “Green |
Pastures.” It is the wholesome lind
of humor which is aroused in us as
simple-minded men and women in
blase. And there is pathos! The au-
dience is roaring with laughter one
moment at some naive remark on the |
part of the Lord or Gabriel, or Noah,
or the “sarub angels,” and the next
moment the audience is hushed, and
yne sees many hands brushing wet
eyes. When the Lord says to Gubricl,
“Gab, this business of being a Lord
ain’t all a bed of roses,” one ean
almost hear folks catching their
breath as the implications of the un-
ferlying philosophy go home.

There are eighteen scenes in the
play with settings alternating between
the very colorful episodes of tl
‘Chosen Race" on earth, and very
irab office of the Lord in heaven, Onc
smiles at that office with its roll-toy
desk, its leather cushioned armeh:
its three stiff chairs for visitors, and
its one window that looks down on
the earth. But when Mr. Harrison
interprets the tragic pain in the heart
of God over the failure of his cherish-
ed “experiment,” man, even the crude
appointments seem sacred,

One is bailed in the attempt to
indicate which scenes of the play |
stand out as the most compelling. |
The trek of the “Chosen People”
across the desert toward the ‘Prom-
ised Land’ is perhaps one of the
most powerful scenes, The final scene
in which the Lord explains to Gabriel
thata certain young man down on the
earth had taught Him a lesson that
anything really worth while al-
ways achieved through suffering, is
«a powerful revelation of the under-
lying philosophy of the play.

*A FAREWELL TO ARMS”
By Kenneth Haynes '31

Laurence Stallings could not have
more faithfully dramatized Ernest
Hemingway’s novel, nor could he have
made a better play of this realistical-
ly naughty war. story. So when the
piece peters out—as we predict it
soon will—Mr. Stallings can go back
and rest again on his “What Price
Glory” laurels, assured that we ap-
preciated his effort.

Everything seemed to favor a suc-
cessful run for “A Farewell to Arms.”
A director was borrowed from the
Theatre Guild, as well as two of that
organization's actors. But even with
the aid of an excellent cast, the play
did not click. The morbid existence
of those behind the lines in wartime,
is too messy for drama. The play,
however, afforded a unique evening
with subjects that are not generally
liseussed in public. ’

“ONCE IN A LIFETIME"

Here,is one of the ‘few plays pro-
duced so far this season that is likely
to celebrate an anniversary at the
Music Box this time next year. It is

and laugh. 4

The dramatics leader contended,
thowever, that the lack of suitable
facilities hinders the work of the or-
ganizations. “We are forced to pre-
gent our productions in the auditor-
fum of the Lewisburg High School.
The possibilities of achieving ade-
quate lighting efferts or of construct-

thought they may seem ideal com-

Scope Limited

“Working on foreign grounds,” he
continued, “and working with few
facilities, our scope has necessarily
been decidedly limited. We do hope,
however, to present a quite varie
group of plays this year, exercising
all our ingenuity to aceomplish strik
ing effects.

“The standard of work electe
will be improved,” he added. “A
committee has been selected to choose
works suited to collegiate production.
While only two plays, ‘The Cat ani
the Canary,’ and ‘Duley,’ have been
selected thus far, our repertoire will
include a modern mystery play, a
melodrama, a colorful costume play,
and serious dramas."

groups are at work at many colleges,
ineluding Bucknell, in making pre-
liminary observations regarding the
relations of college life and religion.

The proposed areas of conversation
for this vacation time conference
number seven and are as follows: (1)
The administrative policy; (2) The
educational system; (3) The social
and organized groups of the campus;
(4) Moral standards in a day of
relativity; (5) Social attitudes and
responsibilities; (6) Personal counsel-
ing and vocational guidance; (7) ‘The
place of religion in higher education.

Attendance at the conference will
not be restricted to college adminis-
trators and teachers alone, for stu-
dents wiill be privileged to attend and
present their viewpoints.

engineering. This has been the aver-
age increase for the past five years.
About half of the freshmen in the
chemical engineering course are from
New Jersey, two are from the New

Chemical Engineers
| Assigned Problems

WILL REQUIRE THESIS
BEFORE GRADUATION

|
Research problems for senior and

graduate chemical engineers were
assigned last week by Dr. S. C. Og-
burn Jr., head of the department of
chemical engineering. A thesis is)
required by the department of ali|
seniors before graduation.

The students must submit monthly
reports as to the progress of the work
or: their problems, and ‘in addition have |
frequent conferences with the profes-
sor in charge. Problems ussigned are
either new ones or some undeveloped |
phases of old ones. The purpose of
the research is to familiarize the stu-
dent with chemical literature so that |
he may readily find out what ix being

jer. He pointed out that life is the
basis for all literature and that life
itself is everywhere essentially the
same,

Citing the Hellenic and Hebraic
literatures as typical examples of the
misuse of great treasures, he showed
that in both cases the wrong attitude
for their appreciation has been adopt-
ed. He contended that in the case of
the Greek and Latin classics a critical
study of the mechanics of verse and
of syntax has obscured the beauty of
the works, while with the Hebraic
contributions, controversy and miscon-
ception have clouded the great na-
tional book from true appreciation.

“What we need,” he concluded, “is
the evolutionary attitude toward Jit-
erature, not the judicial the critica)

ttitude.”

61 Freshmen Report “Doggie” Julian, ’23, Returns Once Again

| To Alma Mater As Albright Grid Coach

For Yearling Track Reading Mentor Who Played End on the Bucknell Squad
Will Bring 1930 Edition of Albright College Eleven to
Memorial Stadium Saturday for Annual Tilt

Alvin “Doggie” Julian, ’23, returns to his Alma Mater on Saturday;
bringing with him this year’s edition of the Albright College eleven, who
wiill do battle with the Bisons in Memorial Stadium at 2:30 p. m., on that

day. This will be
the second gridiron
tussle of the year for
both the Albright
and Bucknell teams.
Coach Julian
learned most of his
football at Bucknell
in the fall years of
20, ’21, and '22, un-
der “Pete” Reynolds,
and that he learned
it well there is no
doubt. Last year's
Julian machine lost
only two tilts, to
Western Maryland
and Bneknell, two of
the most powerful
teams in the Yast.
After his gradua-
tion at Bucknell,
“Doggie" played
professional football
for two years, and
made quite a name
for himself in this
field, at which he ex-

celled while at Buck-
nell. In 1925, he

signed up as head coach of Schuylkill College, ut Reading, where he has

since stayed, surviving the merger of
years ago.

Dempsey kicked to the Stroudsburg
twenty yard mark to open the play
in the third canto. Stroudsburg
proved unequal to the task of making
their ten yards and punted to Meyers
on the Bueknell forty-two yard line,
where he was downed. A gain off
tackle by Meyers netted twelve yards
and « first down on the visitors 46

On the next play they kicked ove

Peters added four; and Meyers, be-

was his third touchdown of the game,

and he was replaced by Kubacki.

Again Dempsey kicked to the visi-

play. On the next try Stroudsburg
lost four yards and Fox stopped an

Endler missed the goal. Stroudsburg
returned Dempsey's kickoff thirteen
yards as the quarter ended.
Stroudsburg Penalized

On the first play of the new period
Stroudsburg was penalized for having
a back in motion. They then kicked
out of bounds on their own 30. Ku-
backi made five yards on a fake pass;
Priest went for 23 off tuckle; Peters
garnered a yard through the center,
and Priest plunged over to equal
Meyer's total of three touchdowns.
Stroudsburg was offsides giving the
yearlings the extra point. Priest
was replaced by Peters. Stroudsburg
kicked to Dorman who was downed on
his 40. Kngacki made five, and Peters
punted to Stroudsburg'’s 20. Gamber
went in for Kubacki. . On an attempt-
ed punt Stroudsburg ran the ball for
a five yard gain. Gamber received
the visitor’s punt and returned to the
“Teacher's” 45 yard stripe. Gamber
lost seven yards on n fumble. Peters
made five yards and then Dempsey
punted to Stroudsburg’s 20, but the
Frosh were offside. Dempsey kicked
again to his opponents ‘80,
burg tried two plays then punted out
of bounds on their own 45 as the
game ended, :

The play of the Frosh was, on the
whole, as good as might be expected
so early Jn the season. They showed
lots of power and some sweet ball-
running ability. The work of the line
was of high caliber as well. Among
those who stood out in the forward
wail, were, Dempsey at tackle, Farina
at center, Fox and Endler at the wing
posts, and Dorman at guard.) The
backfield hones were well divided be-
tween Priest and Meyers. Peters and
Kubaci showed much ability ay well.

“Public Confidence is Resource of All
Advertisers,” Calkins says---

The whole fabric of advertising rests on public confidence, which may
be likened to a vast natural resource to be conserved for the benefit of all ad-
vertisers and not abused and destroyed by the few, the vandals of business.

Public Confidence is weakened by all dishonest advertising.

While

the law is able to take care of the coarser and cruder swindles, there are de-
vices far more destructive which can be reached and restrained only by an
enlightened public opinion on the part of advertisers and agents who work

for them.

The millenium

However, public opinion has been steadily crystallized and business is
tending to get better in its observance of ethical distinctions because it has
learned that in the long run it pays.

is not yet here, but

gross breaches of good faith are apt to react on the advertiser responsible, as
the opposition stirred by the advertising tactics of the American Tobacco
Company has shown.

No practice should be followed by one agent which if followed by all
would demoralize the practice of advertising and render it unprofitable to all

engaged in it.

of preserving their profession as a whole.

Doctors are competitors, but do not acquire patients by undermining
each other's methods. The practice of advertising, like the practice of medi-
cine, depends largely on faith, the faith of the patient in medicine, the faith

We hope the band und cheerleaders
forget their dignity in the next game
and lead a few cheers and play some-
thing. We could even stand “Come

Bueknell Unmerciful

In the seeond half Bueknell was
again unmereiful. Soon after the
kickoff, the Bisons were again in
scoring position. Trudnak fell on a
Geneva fumble deep in enemy terri-
tory. When several backs failed to
gain, Ammerman dropped back and
unlenshed a toss to Ross, who ran 20
yards to score. Geneva was again
offside, and again Bucknell was
| awarded the extra point.

medicine suffers, and when advertisers lose faith in agents, advertising suffers.
An agent is-bound to believe other agents capable and honest and see
to it that they are, by cooperative establishment of tests and standards. If
we cannot have collective faith in our collective efforts we cannot procure
the confidence of the individual advertiser in our individual efforts. After
all, advertising, like medicine, is greater than its exponents and practitioners.

The letter to the Dean from Mr.
Fisher follows.

“Your favor of the 18th instant re-
lative to proposed change in our pas-
senger service ‘effective ‘September
28th, 1930, has been the subject of
very careful consideration and while
our patronage on the trains in ques- |

| gree and our Company would seem |
justified in curtailing the service to
in a measure compensate for the loss
in revenue, the Management dislik-
es very much inconveniencing any of
its good friends in your territory.

“I am pleased therefore, to advise
you that it has been decided to con-
tinue to operate after September
28th, 1930, all of the service you have
had heretofore.

‘We trust that all of our friends
will appreciate this action on the part
of our Company and help us regain
some of the busines we have lost.”

Alleged Violations
Of Rushing Rules
To Go Unpunished

————

Senior Council Fails to Act as |
Nearly Every Fraternity
Becomes Involved ,

In a series of six meetings during
men’s rushing season, the Senior
Council discussed alleged violations
of the rushing rules by several fra-
ternities, but failed to take any action
to either punish the freshmen for
breaking the rules or to censure the
fraternities involved. As far as the
‘Council is concerned, the rushing sea-
son charges have heen dropped.

The matter was taken before the
faculty, but nothing has been forth-
coming from that move. The ques-
tion of who to punish was so involved
that even the faculty was able to
offer no suggestions. |

Charges of breaking the rushing |
rules were levelled against one fro-
ternity at first, put subsequent dis-
cussion revealed that almost every |
fraternity in the university had vio- |
lated the regulations in one reaps. |
«Yr another. The Council meetings’
were full of hidden threats and coun-
ter-threats, and in such an atmos-
phere, according to one Council mem-
ber, it was impossible to come to any
just decsion.

While campus opinion is divided on
the matter, many students and facul-
ty members are of the opinion that
the rules this year proved more suc-
cessful than in any previous year,

“The greatest weakness in the
rushing rules this year,” said Edward

The band has done important work
in the Gevelopment of the silver clari-
net? Formerly frowned upon by band
this insthu-

tion, is tnking its place among the
woodwinds since the metal medium
makes possible a more sccurate in-
strument.

It is not only for its musieal value
that Captain Stannard favors the |
metal clarinet however. “I aim glad
we have pioneered in the silver clari-
net movement,” he said. “Not only
does the band present a ‘snappier’
appearance, but it is my judgment
that the tonal and symphonic quali-
ties which we try to stress in our
ensemble playing has been improved.”

Coach Snavely Gives Basic Principles |
For Development of Football Plays

“The Basis of Good Football.Is Soundness,” Writes Bison Mentor
In Article Printed in June Issue of “Athletic Journal ;”
“Sound Offense is Based Upon Sound Plays”

The following article, by Coach
Carl Snavely, the Bison football men-
tor, was written last semester as a
class assignment in Professor L. E.
‘Theiss’ class in Magazine Article
Writing, and promptly sold by the au-
thor ‘to the Athletic Journal, which
printed it in the June issue.

Bueknell stndents and partisans of
the Bison football team will find much
in it that is of interest, for this ar-
ticle sets forth Coach Snavely's basic
principles for the development of
football plays.—-The Editor.

The basis of good football is
soundness. A sound offense is based
upon sound plays. Sound plays are
based upon sound fundamentals; and
sound fundamentals are assignments
which the players can execute against
opponents who are their equal in
every respect. Base your plays upon
what you know your men can do
against strong opponents. See that
they do those things, and don't ex-
pect more,

Frequently, if not usually, the play
which attracts the attention of the
younger couch is not a play which is
strong in itself. Often it is merely
n check play, a variation of some
more basic play, and is designed to
make the defense a little
Often it may be an_ inconsistent,
wround gainer, but occasionally it
may produce a spectacular run if it
eatches the opponents deploying co
Stop the stronger play which it re
sembles. A collection of tricky
muneuvers, such as this, without their
key plays look great if we
only coulc y~ponents ether-
zed while we operate, But against
wide-awake opposit we usually wil

Sometimes it is overdone,
it can be secured without violating
the principles of sound play, it is of
great value. But such deception, a

the sacrificing of interference is a

of four or five plays designed as vari
ations of stronger plays which they
resemble, although striking at other
points. A few of our strengest pla;
ean often be mode mero cffective
such check plays can be devised for
use with them.

The chances of fooling ever: be !«
the opposing team are poor, and I do
not believe that any time at all should
be wasted on a play which does not
have at least one blocker for every
dangerous opponent. The = better
teams will be the harder to fool. The
poor teams can be beaten without
Tooling them. Therefore, J believe in
muking the trick plays come up to
the same fundamental requirements
needed for the other plays. If this
can not be done with a play it is
searcely worth using. One can not
depend upon the opponents’ being
fooled and it is hardly worth gam-
bling on.
jase Offense on Controllable Factors

Instead of gambling on the gulli-
bility of the opponents, you had bet-
ter base your offense on factors which
you, yourself, e#n control. This, in
my opinion, is one of the most im-
portant rules of all. What is the
use of spending hours and days of
valuable time on plays whieh can not
work unless some opponent happens
tc behave in a certain manner, which
you might expect, but over whieh you
have no control? For jnstanee,-con-
sider those clever plays in which a
guard pulls out as if to run aroun
the end for interference nnd as the
defensive lireman comes charging
through the hole thus vacated— if he
dees, that is—a backfield man side
swipes him and the ball carrier darts
past the charging lineman and
through the space he just left. But

coache

but when

what if he doesn’t charge? We had a
couple of these plays that we used
one season until we met a good guard,
Sometimes he charged; sometimes he
drifted along the line of scrimmage;
and sometimes he stood still, holding
off the offensive linemen with his
hands, all of which was good football.
He just wouldn’t do what we wanted
him to do, and as a result these plays

showed a net loss for the afternoon.
I dropped them.
Plays Depend on Defense's Action
Of course, all plays depend in a
measure upon the defense following
some expected course of action. Ba |
in many cases, the defense has no
alternative, or ut least we can govern
its behavior to some extent. For
example, if a defensive tackle were
to play four or five yards out beyond
our end it would be entirely impos- |
sible to run outside of him. But by |
hitting inside him once or twice we |
could quickly compel him to come in

} Opinions Differ

Opinions differ on many questions
f offensive tactics, and among the

ings Which often puzzle coaches are
those points upon which equally suc-
cessful coaches hold opposite views.
For instanee, Rockne depends en-
tirely upon a balaneed fine and a
quick shift of his backfield. Warner
is just us strongly in favor of an un-
balanced line without any shift. Dif-
ferences of opinion concerning the
huddle, double wing-back, and other
phases exist among the best authori- |
My own advice is, don’t worry
The continued success
of leaders who have adopted opposite

ides of such controversies proves
that one method is as good as the
other, provided the execution is equal-
ly good and the plays equally sound.
My feeling is that the wise coach is
the one who can select the methods
best adapted to his material and to
his own knowledge. Other things
being equal, choose the simplest man-
tuvers and concentrate upon the
jblocking and other fundamentals. No
matter how substential and sound
your offense Is, it will) work only
when the defensive men are put out
of the way.

Build to Beat Good Teams

Build to beat the good teams. [f
pyou can do that, you don’t need to
| worry nbout the poor ones.

But do not let your principles cur-
tail your freedom of thought. Re-
member that an unorthodox play,
used on rare occasions, may take

ties.

veputation for such surprises may
worry them continuously. But don't
regard su¢h exceptions as anything
but a gamble. Never place any real
dependence upon a gamble. When
;you have nothing to lose, take a
chance. But when you build your
offense, build upon those  funda-
mentals which, in the words of Bob
Zuppke, “will be practienble aggoinst
the strongest team, on the worst
fieldl, on the wettest day.”

Prof. R. F. Hamblin Describes
Sights of Vergilian Pilgrimage’

Russell F. Hamblin of the depart-
ment of Greek Language and Liter-
ature, was a member of the Vergilian
Pilgrimage which was conducted
during the summer by the American
Classical League. The trip, which
commemorated the two thousandth
anniversary of Vergil’s birth, was
under the leadership of well known
archeologists and artists.

Starting from Marseilles, France,
the party cruised around the Mediter-
ranean for nearly six weeks, the nas-
sengers generally sleeping on the
boat, and landing by day for sight-
seeing trips to the points of classical
interest. -

Some of the places visited

“the centre of the world”

is utterly neglected, weeds are
springing up among the ruins and
erosion is doing its work, In an-
other ten years nothing will he left
of the work of Schlieneaun and Dor-
feld.

“At Delos 1 was astonished at the
extent of the ruins. There are ruins
of many private houses almost as
good as any at Pompeii. ............ Of all
the places I have seen next to Athens,
Delos has appealed to me most.

The plan has not yet been put to a
vote by the entire senior class, the
group that has been picked to raise
the funds. When the matter is voted
upon, we feel confident that it will
be defeated, for surely the majority
of the class has not forgotten that
Bucknell takes as much pride in its
dignity and refinement as does any
university. To adopt the famed
slogan of two years back, “Is Buck:
nell a University or a Business Col-
lege?”

Bucknell has been and continues to
be known for its high standing among
| educational institutions; it needs no
garish sign mounted on one of its
historic buildings. The sign idea
\seems like some high-pressure sales-
man’s dream come true,  A_ better |
juse for the money of the class of
1931 would be a sizeable contribution
to our library, That would be a
gift that would last for more yeurs
than any sign, a gift that would |
further the purpose for which Buek-
nell was established—the dissemina- |
tion of truth.

The one logical arguinent set forth
in favor of the sign is that it would
be a means to distinguish the Uni-
versity from the proposed  federsi

penitentiary. On that piece of rea-
soning we offer no comments.

However, if the seniors feel they
must mar the Union county landscape
by erecting the sign, we have one
small request to make. Give the
other institution so near Fast College
a break and add below “Bucknell
University” the words “And Soft
Drinks.”

ON TAKING UP ARMS
To be accused of being every sort
of mischfef maker from an under-
miner of religion,
public morals to a half-cocked
former is not a pleasant thing. Suen
allegations have been fired at the
Bucknellian recently, so it seems op-
portune to make a statement of
policy.

A SIGN OF THE TIMES

The proposed electric sign for East
College awakened in one campus wit
an idea along similar lines, but a de-
cided improvement, withal. His sug-
gestion was that around the cornice
of the library be construeted a mov-
ing electric sign similar to that on
the Times building in New York. All
sorts of necessary bulletins, he said,
could be flashed on at will. Every-
one, fascinated by the words  tiat
would whiz around the building, would
watch the sign for bulletins that per-
tained in a personal way. The origi-
nator of the idea said the sign would
unify the college, increasing espirlt
de corps, or some such.

For example, no longer would the
dean have to send out his little cards,
He would merely notify the control
room of his desires, and in a few mo-
ments the words “The dean wants to
see Mr. Smoltz immediately" would
travel around the library. The bul-
letin “Hooligan, it has been reported
that you haven’t been to chapel in a
month” would bring Immediate re-
sponse, no doubt.

The suggestion was also advanced
that the facilities of the sign be open
to every campus organization. To
illustrate, some dull winter morning
on the Hill might be enlivened by the
bulletin “The boys at the Phi Gam
house ask that their Mr. Putts report

|soon so that Mr. Ogle can have his

overcoat, the latter having a 10:30 to
make,” or the flash “The Sigs ask

i Among the Bonkstalls |
Reminiscenses: ‘Twenty-Five Years iit
: Vietoria, Brazil
By Mr. and Mrs. Loren M. Reno
(By Kenneth Haynes, '3t)

The Reno reminiseences make a
small comfortable-looking volume,
which would fill an evening with
enough of the romance of a mission-
ary’s life to compel a further inter-
est, Mr. Reno has written the first
part of the book, and his style is very
clear and conversational, with a quiet
air about it which seems to reflect
his inner life. The background for
his work in Brazil is given very brief-
ly, the important element of his early
life being the faet that he felt “the
urge” and followed jit—to Victoria.

The bringing of the Gospel into
this section of Brazil was indeed an
undertaking which took courage, but
Mr. and Mrs. Reno took their infant
child and established a family in the
mission field. They were eminently
successful. A church came first, and
then a school—and then other de-
velopments.

At the end of 1904, the year in
which they arrived at Victoria, the
Renos boasted of one church, five
congregations, ten baptisms, 135
members and one helper. Now they
have 14 churches, 1300 members, 20
congregations, 45 more preaching
stations, 40 Sunday schools and 1870
pupils, 10 church buildings with nine
jmore in construction, and eight daily
schools.

Bucknell Supports Work

Bucknell has recognized the pur-
port of Mr, and Mrs, Reno's work
among the Brazilian natives by sub-
scribing to their caure. Mr. Reno
says that the money secured by our
drive “helped out like magic.” He
feels that “the project means more
morally than financially to both
parties.”

Principals Assoc.
ficars Address
By Dr. Wood

PROFESSOR T. P. SMITH
ELECTED PRESIDENT

Association to hold Next Meeting
Here, In Conjunction With
Education Conference

“Education exists nowhere except
fn the minds and hearts of individ-
uals,” declared Dr. Benjamin D.
Wood, of the department of psychol-
ogy at Columbia University, in an
address entitled “The Relation of the
Carriegie Study to the High Schools
of Pennsylvania,” given before the
Susquehanna Valley Principals Asso-
ciation at a dinner at the Cameron
House, Monday evening.

At the business meeting of the or-
ganization, Prof. T. P. Smith, prin-
cipal of the Bloomsburg High School,
was elected president for the coming
year; Prof. I, V. Guigan, of Jersey
Shore, was elected vice president;
and Dr. Frank G, Davis, head of the
department of education at Bucknell,
was re-elected secretary.

The Association will hold its nex‘
meeting here October 31, in connec-
tion with the Conference on Edues-
tion which will be in progress at that
time.

Attacks Education System

In this talk Monday evening, Dr.
Wood attacked the present system of
education as existent in high schouls,
end pointed out the dangers of cur-
riculum construction by men who
have never seen the children for
whom they are prescribing.

“We leave the most important thing:
fr education to a few tired people
in education to a few tired people,
who have no interest in education,
“subject matter specialists,” he said.
“Ninety percent of personnel work
must be done in the elementary and
junior high schools. Thousands of
young people come to college, and we
know nothing about them. If Henry
Ford or the Wright brothers had been
among this regiment, they probably
sould have had little opportuni!
labor outside of sc e %
creative work,

Checks Up Records

Checking up on some of
ords these young people wh ome
aeeking an education by means of the
Carnegie examinations, we find a di
erepency in some of the high schoo
records and the averages made in th
Carnegies. Several students wer
discovered whose high school records
were worth only a C, who made high
scores in these examinations.

sires, and not hold themselves to

4s almost criminal to allow a child to
go through high school without at-
tacking the college mania. Neary
800,000 students enter college each
year, and one-third of them fail in
disgrace. The credit system in our
achools was borrowed from our peni-

History of Epigram
Subject of Lecture
By Prof.J. P. Whyte

“It Is a Bit of Sound Philosophy
Or Common Sense Phrased
To Be Unforgettable.”

Speaking on the subject, “Epigra-
suatic Literature,” Professor James
P. Whyte of the department of Eng-
lish delivered the second lecture of
the course in Workd Literature last
Friday evening in the playroom of
the new dormitory.

Professor Whyte traced the history
of the eplgram, felling how sueh men
as Homer, Plutarch, Aeschuyles, Bu-
ripides, Tacitus, and Virgil created
epigrams of widespread significance,
many of which are still commonly
used.

Professor Whyte defined an epi-
gram as a bit of common sense or
sound philosophy, said in such a way
ms to make it unforgettable. He
further stated that the epigram be-
longs to all peoples and to all times.
(He stressed the faet that many fam-
ous epigrams have survived the mgos
and have come down to us
present day.
out that the saying, a stitch in time
saves nine, was common as far back
as 600 B. C. Professor Whyte also
spoke of the prominance of the epi-
grams in the Bible.

Dr. T. EF. Hamblin, Professor
Emeritus of Greek language = and
literature, will deliver the third lec-
ture in the playroom of the new
dermitory on Friday, October 9, Stu-
dents who wish to attend the lectures,

Cast Selected
By Committee

KENNETH HAYNES, ’31,
GAINS LEADING ROLE

Rest of Cost is Not Unfamiliar
For Every One Has Appeared
In Former Plays

The cast for Cap and Dagger and
Frill and Frown’s first production of
|the year was selected last Thursday
night when the student candidates
ine judged by a committee of five
in Bucknell Hall. John J. Volgarino,
‘31, president of Cap
acted as chairman.

“The Cat and Canary,” a melo-
tenor in four acts, by John Willard,

and Dagger,

which has been selected as the entree |

to the 1930-'31 dramatic season at
| Bucknell, requires a cast of ten. The
dramatic societies will present their
premiere October 28, in the Lewis-
| burg High School auditorium.

The dramatis personae will find
Kenneth A. Haynes, '51, at its head
jas “Roger Crosby.” Haynes starred
jin “Hell Bent for Heaven,” the Com-
mencement play last June. His re-
jturn to the stage in “The Cat and
Canary” will be eagerly anticipated
by those who have seen his character

portrayals in other productions,

The rest of the cast will not be
unfamiliar, for without exception the
jeharacters have been seen in Cap and
Dagger and Frill and Frown plays of
the past. Edna R. Cleckner, ’33, who
has the chief female part, will enact
the role of “Annabelle West.” Mary

Bollinger Released

Prot. O. S. Groner

From Yellowjackets i

It was learned this past week that
Edward Bollinger, ex-’30, has been
relensed by the Frankford Yellow-
Jackets.

While at Bucknell, Bollinger was
one of the mainstays on the varsity
line. He played three years as a
regular tackle after playing every
minute of every game for the frosh,

It was with no little surprise that
the news of “Eddie’s" release came
to the campus, as it was known that
he had been used in every game
Frankford had played so far this sea-
son, /

Besides being a good jineman, Bol-
Hnger was adept at converting points
by the placement method. In the
first game the “Jackets” played, ‘“Ed-
die” halved the honors with Hatieli
in kicking extra points.

The scientific research fraternity,

Night Football Popular

Night football is popular in Phila
delphia, and Temple has been draw-
ing a good crowd in her opening
games with Thiel and St. Thomas
The clash with Bucknell should jam
the Temple stands because of the in-
tense rivalry between the colleges.
Last year Carl Truxel, who is now
coaching the Blson ends, and Clark
Hinkle starred in the 18 to 0 Buck-
nell win, The game was played on
treacherous footing, for rain soaked
the stadium throughout the game,

Temple has made additions to its
coaching staff since that day. Heinie
Miller still guides the Owls, but he
has added capable assistants to his
staff. Rert Bell, former backfield
coach at Pennsylvania, has been

Bucknell started its first drive from
the Albright 37 yard line. In nine
plays the Bison backs had pounded
their way to a touchdown. Hinkle
scored on a line plunge from the &

kickoff, Bucknell scored again. The

Brumbaugh had started around right

caught flatfooted, and man after man

| hampered by a laek of sufficient play-
ers to form two teams for scrimmage
lin practice. This shortage of ma-
terial caused Manager Meadowcroft
to speak in upperelass chapel Friday

team.

Coach John D. Plant has been di-
viding the squad in two during the
past week for practice sessions and
Bucknell will have ao strong team
when they meet Stroudsburg this
Saturday at Stroudsburg.

The game with the “Teachers” is in
the nature of a return contest, for
Stroudsburg met the Bisons last fall
in Bucknell's first intercollegiate soe-
cer game, The “Teachers” had a
great attack that day and won easily
2-0. This year the Bisons will not be
taken into camp so easily for they
have gained valuable experience
which should stand them in good
stead.

statement was made before the first

for they overwhelmed the Strouds-

The Bisonette backs ran wild
against the ‘Peachers,” and showed
that they would be hard to stop in
any game. Myers, Priest, Kubacki,

game. Captain Tony Slate should be
ready to go full syyeed by next Friday

der the strain of the play against the
Lions and he should be the Tony of
old by Friday night.

Roth coaching staffs are anticipat-
ing a hard game and no stones are
being left unturned in the efforts of
the opposing camps to field their best
possible combinations at game time.

Whether Temple will be able to
work her hidden ball plays suecess-
fully is a matter of conjecture. They
worked against St. Thomas, but Buck-
nell may be a different proposition.
If the Bison line can be whipped into
shape by next Friday night, fans may
look for a very close game with the
result a toss-up.

drilling

This is Fordham’s eieventh straight
win. The Fordhamites seemed to
have no trouble after the first quar-
ter, although the recovery of fumbles
and the interception of passes were
directly responsible for the large
score. As Fordham has yet to goup
against a team of her own caliber for
a real test, the first two victories are
no reliable indication of her ability.

Passes s Flying Tests

Received High Honors of Group

At San Diego Air Station

Word has just been received by Dr.
H. T. Colcstock, head of the depart-
ment of history, that his son, Ensign
E. Colestock, '26, a graduate of the
United States Naval Academy last
June, recently passed his flying tests
at the Naval Air Station, San Diego,
California, with the highest honors
of the group which continued there
after graduation from Anrapolis.

It was » month's heavy instruction |

and hard work—and plenty of thrills,
according to Edward. He will either
go with the November or March
group to Penswcola, Florida, for
further instruction along the lines of
aviation.

Ensign Colestock captained the
Navy basketball] team last year, and
has now been asked to coach this
sport on the §, S. Oklahoma. Cole-
stock was married last June to Miss
Jane Knight, of Lansdowne, Pa., two
days after his graduation.

"Peachy" Kling Ret POVOrS

“Peachy” Kling, the  Bison’s
trainer who has been very ill dur-
ing the past few weeks, is well on
the way to recovery, and will be
back with the boys regularly in
the near future.

Mr. Kling, who had not missed
one Bucknell game until the Bisons
met Albright College, insisted on
going to Philadelphia with the
team, and took complete charge of
the baggage, much tu the concern
of both players and coach, He 1s
now back in Lewisburg and seems
none the worse for his fun in
Philadelphia.

Varied Housewarming Program
To Include Buffet Luncheon
For Bucknell Trustees

The Kappa Sigmas are once again
a completely mnited chapter, housed
in one of the newest and best equip-
iped fraternity homes on the campus.

ent active chapter, moved into the
new home and slept for the first time
{under its roof Tuesday night.

Breakfast this morning was the
first meal served in the dining hall.
| Forty-five men will have their meals

Old English predominates through-
out the house. Upon entering the
| front door a vestibule immediately
|inside leads to a spacious foyer with
ja slate floor. To the left of the
foyer, and one step down, is the living
room, which is two stories in height,

ing up vocational work with the
Army Y. M. C. A., and serving as an
educational specialist with the U. S.
Navy.

It’s all off, so beer self. But, as
we of the intelligentsia well know,
“every cloud hus a silver lining.” It
is rumored that many men are going
to transfer to Lafayette now that
this edict has been issued. At that
maybe they shouldn’t be censured for
their actions. Even Easton has some

This is, no doubt, Dickinson's con- | creased the enrollment in American

again the first year gentlemen hurled
themselves upon the stout hearted
brutes of the second class, only to be

repulsed under a shower of — refuse. |

The novel idea of stretching the rope
coupled with the characteristic bash-

many frosh caused them to suffer far
more than ‘was necessary from nasal

It is reported that the newly installed

As the story goes, a group of stu

the business depression is a possible
explanation for the increased enroll-

| which has prevailed lately, parents
| have seen that it is the college man

or woman who has landed the job.”

Those Were the Days

To The Sports Editor:

The weekly arrival of the Buck-
nelllan is an event, in a busy enough
| world, to which I look forward with
the greatest interest and pleasure.

Just at this time of the year, the
atmosphere almust tingles and snaps
with that healthy football spirit. It
gets “under your skin,” as it were,
and it makes one think of victories
and defeats of years gone by,

Few loyal Bucknellians will forget

game, I happened to be one of those

alumni supply the interest. For ex-
ample: the man who desires to add
$1000, to the endowment, but who
cannot do so, may give the anid |
interest at 5%, or $50.00.

This type of fund also makes a
| particular appeal because it prawitige'|
a medium through which the alumnus ,
of limited financial means may to an
extent commensurate with his year
| by year income, contribute his bit in
such a way that it, along with the
combined gifts of others, aggregates
a total which is of grent practical
benefit.

CONGRATULATIONS
Alpha Phi chapter of Kappa Sigma
is to be congratulated upon the com-
pletion of its distinctive new house

on University Avenue. The newest

the College, «nd closer contact of
alumni with college affairs, are quite
as valuable as the financial return.
On the basis of a subtle prineiple in
human nature, alumni are far more
deeply attached to their college ee
they have bestowed something upon|

=\it beside criticism.

The Bucknell Alumni Fund is the
result of much investigation and]
study by the General Alumni Asso-
ciation through committees, covering
a period of several years. In June,
1929 the plan was adopted by the
Alumni Council and in December,
,1929 the Bucknell Alumni Fund was
sanctioned by the Board of Trustees.
The Alumni Fund is distinctly an
alumni project, directed to and by
alumni. On the principle that many
small gifts equal a few very large
ones, the fund plans call for “Some-
thing from Everyone." The amount
of each yearly gift is left entirely to

| the judgment of the individual done,

‘Yo insure Bucknell’s continuance in
her position as an outstanding Amer-

|

so fortunate, and it will be a long
time before I forget how the Buck-
nell linemen, with tears in their eyes,
und courage and determination in
their hearts held back the ur val
Navy plunges on the one-foot line.
Some might say that it is hard to
believe that men like Gus Shorts and
John Buchovecky had tears in their |
eyes, but it is a fact—I saw that
sight myself from the sidelines.

Defeats Rutgers

That same year, on the following |
Saturday, Bucknell defeated Rutgers
at Franklin Field in Philadelphia.
Rutgers, reputed to be the greatest
team in the East and undefeated that
year so far, met a better team in
Bucknell that Saturday. “Mose”
Wilsbach from Harrisburg, seored
Bueknell’s two touchdowns. [| ean
still see that 195 pound human ‘‘Ram-
rod" splitting that strong Rutgers
forward wall as though it was mere
tissue paper. “Mose” Wilsbach, a
battle-searred warrior of many Buck
nell intercollegiate contests, surely
deserves his name listed among Buck
nell’s football immortals.

Many other Bucknell triumphs come
back as | think through the past
Some of them are:

1923—Bucknell 14

1924—Bueknell 14

1925—Bucknell 8—Georgetown 2.

1926—Bucknell 27—Lehigh 0.

Remembers Unusual Game

In passing, 1] must not fall to men-
tion a sight which I saw on one Oc-
tober Saturday back in 1925 in th
Bucknell Stadium. It will probably
never come to pass again. We beat

that is involved in the construction
of a fraternity house.
of the active chapter of Kappa Sig-
ma have been untiring in their efforts
to build a home in keeping with the
ideals and growth of the fraternity,
but they have also had the advantage
of splendid cooperation on the part
of both the alumni and the Board of
Trustees. In fact, it was only through
the contributions from these two
groups that the bullding of the house
became something more than a pos-
sibility.

It is fitting, then, that Kappa Sig-
ma has chosen to honor these men at
the official house opening. A dinner
for menibers of the University Board
of Trustees and members of the ad-
ministration will be given at the
chapter house Friday evening, Oc-
tober 31. The alumni who have con-
tributed so generously of their tinie
and money will receive oficial recog-

How We Feel
To the Editor:

As one who was utterly aghast at
the proposal of putting a sign on
East College, | weleomed your edi-
torial of last week. It is fitting that
the Bucknellian should take up arms
against an act that would inevitably

Numerous other

’

When we hear of a sign, such as
the one proposed for here, being
erected over the august halls of Hur-
vard or Yale, then it will be time
enough to think of marring the quiet
dignity of our campus for the sake
of the publicity-mad world.

Furthermore, ] cannot quite see the.
purpose of erecting such a_ sign.
Surely Bueknell does not have to ad-
vertise her presence in order to at-
tract prospective students. Is it not
a fact that every year many who
would like to enter are turned away?
Then again, it has been carefully
whispered about that perhaps it was
to help distinguish our buildings from
those of the institution that is soon
to come to Lewisburg. It seems to
me that this lust reason is the most
ridiculous of them all, for who would
ever confuse the -old  vine-covered
buildings of Bucknell, with the glar-
ing walls of a new penitentiary?

May you continue your campaign
against this preposterous proposal!
There sre cthers on this campus who

That is a capital idea, in that labor
doesn't enter into it. Reading is good
for anyone, especially at Bucknell.
Read anything you pick up. Make
a daily habit of reading, the same as
you brush your teeth. Don't just
improve your digestion. Read Au-

So, you who climb, don't give up
hope. Think of the happler things
of life. In 2845 everything will be
on the level, and the town and gown
will be on even terms. There may
even be a depression to the disadvan-

Mirthful Haven is a book .altogether
different from the other stories
written by Booth Tarkington. In
fact, it may be ealled a near trag-
edy, a style of writing that is quite
foreign to the conception that we
usually have of the work of this
author. An excellent picture of the
life “way down east” has been
given. It is a picture of the char-
acter and life of those people that
could have been drawn only by one
who was familiar with their cus-
toms.

Those Hitch Hikers is not a manual
for college transients, but those
who thumb their way will find
themselves depicted. Booth Jame-
son writes for our generation of
college moderns, and about our
vagaries—if you call them that.

The Woman of Andros is a_ novel
written by Thorten Wilder, with a
plot which he hus taken from the
comedy of Terence “Andria,” The
story proceeds with the usual
smooth, easy style that charaeter-
izes all the work of this writer.
Although the plot is by no means
unusual, the story has been made
so by the charming philosophical
discussions that the author has put
into the mouths of his characters.

scholarship, but also requires the
completion of a genuine research
problem.

These stringent requirements pre-
clude any possibility of a regular
chapter of Sigma Xi being installed
at Bucknell in anything but the very
remote future. Bucknell does not
have the research facilities which
would make a chapter of Sigma Xi
possible. The present organization
upon our campus is a Sigma Xi club,
but not a chapter of the national or-
ganization.

Pinchot Writes Absorbing Narrative
Ot South Sea

Published as the ex-governor was
launching his spirited campaign for
Pennsylvania's executive chair, “To
the South Seas,” a narrative of a
dream realized, sheds an absorbingly
interesting sidelight on the diverse
nature of that unorthodox pelitican,
Gifford Pinchot.

“To the South Seas" is the
growth of boyhood desire exeited by
the nineteenth century English scien-

research “A Naturalist on the Ama-

Track Candidates
Work Out Daily

Six aspirants for the varsity track
team are working out daily on Loomis
Field wnder the direction of John D.
Plant, physieal director, and Charles
L. Titus, '31.

Among those making a bid for a
position on the team are Sidney Z.
Lintz, ’83 and Kenneth J. Wheeling,
’33, who are training for the 440 yard
dash. Donald B, Proctor, '33, half
miler, and Steven L. Windes, ’33,
miler, are taking their tu-ns on the
track and show great promise.  Clif-
ford W. Boothe, '32, who ran the two
mile on the. varsity last year, is out
to hold down that berth this season,
and J. Willard Strouse, '33, who suf-
fered a leg injury last year, has fully
recovered and is out for the 100 yard
dash.

The men are working along with
the freshman squad and are following
a stiff routine, the distance men do-
ing cross-country runs, and the dash
men devoting their time te wind
sprints.

“Norm" Ross, Justin Brumbaugh, and
Wilbur Ammeriman received leg in-
juries which, though not serious, may
keep them on the sidelines during
next Saturday's with St.
Thomas.

The report that Ammeriuan’s leg
was broken is false, and Doctor Les-

ter P. Fowle has announeed that the
men will soon be back in action. This
report is good news to the campus, as
it was thought that Ammerman
would not be able to play during the
remainder of the season.

Soccer Team Takes
Close 1-0 Victory

From Stroudsburg
PEDERSON, LONGSTRETH
OUTSTANDING IN GAME

Goal Netted Soon After heel

Of Second Half, by Koster,
Left Wing on Squad

Bucknell’s Bison booters kicked
their way to a one to nothing vic-
tory in their Initial game of the sen-

son when they defeated the strong

Saturday.

The lone goal was netted by Kos-
ter, left wing, on a play which drew
the Stroudsburg goal keeper out of
position. The entire first half of the
gume was played near the center of
the field with Bucknell on the offen-
sive. The goul came shortly after
the opening of the second half, From
then on until the closing minutes of
the game the play was unusually
spirited. The ‘’Teachers" were press-
ing hard to get back the tally which
wus registered against them, while
the Bucknell backs fought to pre-
serve the slender lead) whieh their
ferwards had given them. The game
ended without further seoring.

This victory is expected to have a
very heartening effect on the Buck-
nell soccer team. Last year two
games were played and both were
lost. The win over Stroudsburg
wipes out the defeat they handed the
lacals here last year,

Captain Vederson led the way in
the gme by his fine offensive work
while Parsons und Longstreth were |
both towers of strength on the de-
fense. On the whole, the play of the
team was the best exhibited so far
this year and, withthe practice before
the Penn State game, there should be
an even greater improvement in that
eneounter.

The first appearance of the team
at home will be the
game with Gettysburg on Loomis

Penn State had little difficulty in
subduing Marshall, 65-0, last Satur-
day, Fathers Day at Penn State.
Evans, Lasich, French, and Miller,
each counted two touchdowns, Martz
and Decindis each one. French kept
things going and contributed to near-
ly every touchdown, Captain Deid-
rich was still unable to play on ac-
count of a minor injury.
Vordhaimn
The powerful Fordham eleven eked
out a 3 to 0 victory over Boston Col-
lege Monday. A drop-kieck by Bartos,
Fordham back, in the last quarter
provided the margin of victory. Tony
Siano, center and captain of the
Rnms, wus the defensive star of the
game. Fordham made {1 first downs
to Boston College's 4, but they
fumbled the ball at opportune mo-
nents to nullify their scoring chances.

opened thelr season Monday with
Kappa Delta Rho defeating Beto |
(Delta Kappa Phi and
Theta Upstlon Omega of levgue two

along with Captain Koehler for the
K. D, R's. The scores were evenly
divided in the two time _ periods.

a goal. In the second period, Haines
again came through with a goal af-
ter the ball had been skillfully ad-|
vanced by Joe Lewis. Lee and Stutz-
man performed well for the Beta |
Kappa's, while Stricker proved him- |
self the superior goalie. .

Brown received a nose injury from
a ball kicked by F. Knights, which
knocked off his eye-glass protectors.

“—as advertised’

OW inany times yon see these two words in the course of 2

shopping: ‘‘This article for sale— idvertised."

Aud those two words areas welcome as they are familiar, f

they form a bond of confidence between the merchant and yoursel

They are his guarantee to you of worth and value

Here is an article that has been described in your newspaper
Its merits have been told; possibly, too its price. You know exactly
what you will get wheu you buy it. You know its quality, its util-
ity; vou know how it fits your needs. And when you buy it, you
know yon are getting not some unapproved substitute but the speci-

fied article—as represented.

It is easy to understand why that phrase, ‘‘as advertised,’’
creates a feeling of confidence. You have learned to depend upon
consistently advertised prodnets. You know that the maker has con-
fidence in them, else he would not spend money calling your atten-
tion to them day after day, and month after month. You know, that
they have been approved by the most critical of investigators—the
buying public. And above all you know from experience that buying

goods ‘‘as advertised’’ is the best investment you can make.

ed the results of their careful train-
ing. Cornny Bonner, brother of the
Temple captain, scored for the Cherry
and White after Hansen’s brilliant 78
yard run. Nick Caterina, Alex Kil-
kuskie and Leon Whittock, the clever
quarterback, were also outstanding
in the Ow) running attack.

Captain Jack Bonner’s play was in-
spirational, and his fine work at end
imbued the Teniple line with a splen-
did fighting spirit which denied Buek-
nell’s charging bucks any easy guin-
ing.

Shows Improvement

Bucknell showed a greatly im-
proved team over the Orange and
Blue outfit of the Albright tussle.
The work of the line was improved,
and after the Bison forward wall had
been a severnl times hy the
tricky ‘Temple offensive, the linemer
buckled down and stopped the Owl
backs time after time. Two sopho-
mores started in the Bison forward
wall, Beaver Williams was in Stone
braker's place at left end while
Otty Nied hed displaced Sam Honk
at left tackle. Slim Mezza started
the game at fullback in Hinkle’s
place, but the rest of the lineup was
the same as started in the Albright
game

Neither team resorted to a kicking
game and both lines had to stand tt
gaff as play after play wa

Driving Contest, Feature
Of Opening

LARGE CROWD EXPECTED |

TO FLOCK TO GREENS

Gene Sarazen, one of the world’s
greatest professional golfers and
open champion of the United States
in 1923, will be one of a foursome
whose match will feature the exten-
sive program for the formal opening
of the Bucknell University golf course
at Homecoming. Sarazen, who will
come here from the Fresh Meadow
Country Club of New York, was the
largest money winner among. tlie
American professionals last yer.

Emil Loefler, designer of the course
and professional of the Oakmont
Country Club of Pittsburgh, will be
another member of the foursome
Loefler held the Western Pennsy!l
vania championship last year, = Th
present open champion of Pennsyl-
vania, “Woodie” Platt, will be a third
member of the party, while the fourth
man's identity is as yet unknown.
All four players will arrive the day
before Homecoming and will be the
guests of the local club.

To Hold Contest and Tourney

Other features of the opening will
be a driving contest and an eighteen
hole tournament. The contest an
tourney are open to alumni, faculty,
and students. Large crowds are ex-
pected to flock to the greens and fair-
ways to see the foursome and to take
part in the other events carded.

Sarazen, an American shoe cobbler
of Italian birth, sprang into promi-
nence almost over night when he
lifted the national open trophy in
1923. He ix recognized as one of the
greatest golfers of all time, and many
consider him the most consistent and
the best “pro” player in America,

lo Tamumerments| # Professor N, H. Stewart.

Dropped from a bunch of bananas |
in which it had coiled some thousand

jwiles before, the snake, temporarily |

{dentified as the Boa constrictor of
Brazil, was captured in the Weis
Pure Food Store, 422 Market street,
and presented to Dr. Stewart. The
reptile is on exhibition in the Biology

The Boa constrictor, a medium
boa attaining a maximum length of
only fifteen feet, is closely allied to
the pythons and to the gigantic ana-
conda. Non-poisonous, all snakes of
this family kill their prey by con-
striction, swallowing whole in some
eases enimals as large as goats.

Ex-Coach Hoskins
Returns As Trainer

CONDITIONS FAR CRY
FROM THOSE HE KNEW

Back in the good old days,
1899 to 1912, George Hoskins coached
all Bucknell athletic
baseball. These were the days when |

teams except

from }

so much that he would will his wealth
to none’ of them. “Annabelle West”
inherits the fortune, and immediately
the homestead becomes a place of

athletics did not hold the high place |
or receive the attention thut they do |

today. Now, “Coach,”
liarly known, has come back to Buck- |
nell in the eapacity of trainer.

Hoskins arrived Saturday and erty)
day since then he has heen taking
care of the ills and ailments of the
Thundering Herd. Conditions today |
at Bucknell are a far cry from those ,
that Noskins had to contend
years ago. When Hoskins coached
Bucknell foothall teams they mig
well have been called the Flounder-
ing Herd, not with reference to their

‘ abjlity, but with respect to the con-
ditions under which they played.
Hoskins frequently had to — solicit

money from the townspeople so the |

Bucknell football team could have
enough carfare to make a trip, The
team was outfitted in a conglomera-
tion of uniforms of all ‘shapes, fash-
ions, and sizes.
Knows His Job

The grizzled trainer, who is taking

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

Daughter of B. U.
Graduate, Trustee,
Swims Hellespont

Eleanor Smith, Of Harrisburg,
Conquers Treacherous
Currents in Feat

“Like father, like son"
cient adage which, in the light of an
article in the Harrisburg Evening
News, must now he modernized to
read “Like father, like daughter.”
For Eleanor smith, the
year-old daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Harvey IF, Smith, has recently dis-
tinguished herself in an athletic way
by swimming the Hellespont.

Her father, who is a noted surgeon
and a member of the Bucknell Board
of Trustees, was also a famous ath-
Yete in his undergraduate days at
Bucknell. He was one of those ‘na-
tural born” athletes who excel in all
sorts of sports. He was particularly
distinguished, however, for his work
on the varsity football: and baschall
teams.

Miss Smith’s feat of swimming the
Hellespont was accomplished last
summer. This famous channel, known
to modern students as the Dardan-
nelles, is a relatively narrow body of
water—one to four miles wide—that
divides Europe from Asia. It is an
exceedingly difficult piece of water to
swim, however, because of the ter-
ribly strong current that sweeps out
of the Sen of Marmora, Students of
Greek will remember that this was
the channel young Leander nightly
swam to visit Hero. And Lord Byron
verfurmed the feat in 1810. But
swimming the Hellespont is a task

News of thelr daughter's victory

as an appropriate birthday greeting |
to her father, himself a noted athlete
}

in and after his college days.
“Rest wishes. Swam Hellespont,”
read the cablegram.

The casual manner in which Miss!/he has served as instructor of edu-| |

Smith regarded her accomplishment
is indicated by the fact that she sent |”
the message almost a week after the
swim was accomplished,

Miss Smith who, with Miss Mary
and Miss Frederica Fronheiser,
daughters of Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Fron-
heiser, 615 North Front street, is
cruising over the ancient route of
Ulysses through the Adriatic, Ionian,
and Aegean seas, learned to swim
under the expert instruction of her
father in the pool at the Smith coun-
try home at Fort Hunter. She in-
herited all-round athletic ability
although she has never sought honors
in swimming competition.

Legend of Leander

A number of those who have match-
«d their strength and skill with the
swirling waters of the strait, which
separates the Greek peninsula of Gal-
Yipoli from Asia Minor and connects
the Marmora and Aegean seas, met
the same fate that overcome Leander.

According to the legend, as re-
lated by Virgil and other Latin poets
Leander fell in love with Hero,
priestess of Venus. Their marriage
forbidden, they met clandestinely
Every night Leander swam across the
Hellespont, guided hy a
Hero’s tower. One night the lamp
fuiled to appear and Leander, lost in
the turbulent water, perished. When
Hero learned of his fate she flung
herself into the stream.

The channel, now known as
Dardanelles, figured tmportantly in
ancient history, particularly
nection with the passage of Xerxes’
huge army over a bridge of hoats,
when he had the unruly waters lash-
ed with ships, and a similar crossing

BISONS vs. BULLETS 1

Saturday is going to be a big day |
for both the Bucknell University cand |
Gettysburg College football teams!

The Gettysburg team has been un- |

\defeated in games played to date, |
and the Battlefield lads have tumbled
two powerful opponents in the East,
Villanova and Lehigh. Bucknell
knows of Villanova’s power, and Le-
high is about on a par with the Main
Liners. Bison fans know that the
game on Saturday is going to be a
real battle.

Bucknell, after her close defeat by
Temple, has been unable to get going
as early-season indications had point-
ed. The Snavelymen are in the
throes of a bad slump, and much de-
pends on their beating Gettysburg
if they expect to enter the Penn
State game in'the proper frame of
mind. In all, Bucknell’s fortunes for
the rest of the season, rest largely
on the outcome of the game at Get-
tysburg.

on a moment's notice. "On the con-

right flavor. ‘Then, its sponsor must
await an auspicious moment before he

A pun of this type is truly a work of
art and is used by many of the na-
ion’s well-known figures.

This pun’s little brother, the eom-
mon pun, is just as potent an in-
fluence in the country’s humor. Any-
one can produce a common, ordinary
pun but just because it is the proper-
ty of the butcher, baker, and ecandle-
stick maker is no reason why this
pun should be looked down upon.
These two types of pun reach more
people and cause more laughter, of-
ten genuine, often feigned, but never-
theless laughter than any other kind
of humor. This, alone, is an over-
whelming vote in favor of the pun.

Dean Miller Speaks
On Religious Trends
At Vesper Services

Does Not Believe Indifference, |

Education, and Capitalism
Will Harm Religion

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

Tonaennareanerssseascstoraaesnsnrersneetecntsceavcassecersionesesoeceseresteny

Dean J. Hillis Miller spoke on the |

modern trends in religion at vesper
services at the Women's College Sun-
day, His purpose was to stimulate
thought in the direction of religion,
“To get college people to think about
religion and to get anywhere jn their
thinking a most dificult and discour-
aging task,” he said.

He critized the article that appear-
ed in the Christian Century on Oc-
tober 15, which was a parable of tho
“Safe and Sage.” It was written in
connection’ with the opening of Dr.
Emerson Fosdick’s church in New
York.

Christianity, according to the edi-
tor, is on the defensive. Dr. Fosdick
is building his church at the foun-
tain head of scepticisnt. It is situ-
ated very near Columbia University
in which many courses are taught
which eneourage scepticism. New
York itself is one of the most irre-
ligious cities, ani furthermore, the
church is being erected by John D.
Rockefeller Jr.. which makes it rep-
resent capitalism. The editor con-
‘tends that education, indifference, and
capitalism are all opposing religion.

Indifference Not Fault of Religion

Dean Miller does not agree with
the editor in that religion against
such obstacles is on its last feet. He
admits that there {s indifference, but
the indifference is not the fault of
religion. “The trouble is that we
haven't gotten it in terms of today.
The fault of many of us is that we
have put in new plumbing, but have
forgotten to turn on the water,” he
said,

“There is more religion in student
who do not represent religious pro
fesslons than in those who do, Those
going into religion are interested in
it from a professional point of view,”
he said.

“One of the moat fallacious idea
that some people get is to think that
if we are educated, we are not re
ligious, It is impossible to say we
are educated until we have thought
the thing through.”

Congratulations, Kappa Sigma!
Does

Your splendid new fraternity house with its spacious
lawns and superior location has reached its consummation
witha happy and joyous house warming. Old and new mem-
bers alike, scattered and inconvenienced for some little time,
appreciate all the more to be under their own vine and fig tree
again, and with all the blessings of home coming, the added
privilege that comes once in a life time of having a new home
and new furniture. After all, no amount of remodeling can
make an old private home quite as well adapted for a fratern-
ity house as the last word of architect and builder alike, not
hindered by old foundations and partitions. Undoubtedly
your new home will become one of Lewisburg's showplaces
and bring greater prestige and growth to Bucknell.

__Its large living room with a high arched wooden beam
ceiling and fireplace, its commodious dining room, chapter and
dormitory rooms, are hardly believable from an exterior view.
Nothing has been slighted that makes for the efficiency of the
caterer’s department, the conveniences of the janitor's base-
ment or the activities that center in the chapter room. The
balcony for its dance orchestra, its ample reception hallway,
its finely equipped guest room for the homecoming alumni. its
over-stuffed furniture, its rugs and draperies, altogether makes
for the convenience of its own social needs and those of its in-
vited guests. We note with pleasure the separate basements.
independent of each other, quite safe from the raids of hungry
members and wandering busybodies. We tip our hats to an
architect who had brains enough to specify amply-sized chim-
neys. We admire your chapter and pool room. Numerous
linen and clothes closets, storage rooms, sanitary bath rooms
on every floor, cozy study rooms for approximately forty men
—all of these betoken the careful details of a well-planned
house, the creation of a specialist in fraternity house archi-
gecture. When the right kind of weather clothes your lawn
with all the grandeur of a competent landscape artist, our
limited superlatives will fail to describe in a large measure tht
pleasure that acrucs to those where appreciation is ownership.

The only local fraternity in 1895, the baby fraternity of
our five nationals in 1896, your growth has been consistent
and healthy and in favor with Bucknell and all sister chapters
of Kappa Sigma. It was the forerunner of several local and
national fraternities whereby the day of the fraternity snob
has passed forever. The year of your organization produced
four noted Bucknell Alumni—one a distinguished lawyer, an-
other a member of our present faculty and two federal judges.
all of whom are still betting on Bucknell as trustees and mem-
bers of the faculty. A slightly later class gave us another
member of the faculty who has now rounded out thirty years

FRESHMEN GIVE
FIRST DEFEAT
TO BELLEFONTE

Baby Bisons Down Belle-
fonte Academy First
Time in History, 7-0

GAME REPLETE WITH
EXCELLENT PLAYING

For the first time in the history of
their relations in football a Buckneil
freshman team defeated Bellefonte
Academy,

In a game replete with excellent
playing on both sides the Baby Bisons
came through with a 7-0 victory last
Saturday at Bellefonte. The touch-
down came in the final period when
Priest whipped a pass to “Hub” Ver-
hey who went over for the score. The
play was on fourth down on Belle-
fonte’s six yard line. Priest took the
ball from center and ran almost the
entire width of the field before he
heaved the pass which brought vic-
tory to his team. James ¢onverted
the extra point to,conclude the scor-
ing.

The entire first half was a closely
fought battle between the two thirty
yard lines.

that would put them in scoring terri-

good and he outilistanced the Belle-
fonte booter. The half ended just |
after Bellefonte failed to make good |
a dangerous scoring attempt.

had worked the ball down to Buck- |
nell's fifteen yard line, but the Frosa
held and the threat was checkeil,
Caravaglio Makes ‘Two Gains

The third quarter was all in Belle
fonte's territory. Caravaglio on two
oceasions thrust deep into the, Belle-
fonte scoring zone only to be stopped
by the safety man; once on a fine run
of thirty yards around the end, and
again on a pass from Priest which
netted a twenty-five yard advance.
The Bellefonte team braced on both |
oceasions and scores were averted.

In the fourth quarter the Frosh
were aided in their attack on the
Bellefonte goal by several penalties
which placed the ball on the home
team’s one-yard stripe. Two attempts
at rushing the ball failed and a five-
yard penalty made it fourth down on
the six yard line. It was at this
juncture that the scoring play, Priest
te Verhey was employed.

The entire team played heads-up
football throughout the encounter,
while the headwork and defensive
strength of acting-captain Heydrick
was outstanding, He handled the
team in a manner which left little to
be desired and proved a strong bar-
rier to opposing backs.

Dorman Stars

“Jack” Dorman led the team in
tackling, pulling down  Bellefonte’s
ball-carriers time after time before
they had reached the line of serim-
mage. The play of Farina and Hep-
ler was of a high caliber as well,

There was only one serious injury
incurred and that was on the play
before Bucknell’s touchdown when
Fox had his hip dislocated. He was
taken to the Bellefonte hospital
where his injuries were treated.

The removal of a coin swallowed by
the two year old danghter of Profes-
sor and Mrs. S. C. Ogburn Jr., waa
the most recent service of Dr. Lester
P, Fowle and his staff at the Ziegler
Memorial Infirmary. The operation
probably saved the little girl's life.

The child swallowed a five-cent
piece while in one of the local grocery
stores with her mother. She was im-
mediately rushed to a physician in
Milton, where an X-ray was taken
which disclosed the coin lodged in her
throat. The child was then hurried |
to the infirmary, where Dr. Fowl
performed the operation by means of |
a standard — eight-millimeter brass |
tuhe, which is a regulary bronchosconc.
Mrs. Mary Seydell and Miss Mirinm

Professor Ogburn assisted Dr. Fowle
in the operation.

Dr. Fowle is one of a very few |
surgeons expert in the science of
bronchoscopy, having taken a special
course in that subject at the’ Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania last spring, un-
der the direction of Dr. Chevalier
Jackson, the inventor of the broneho-.

“Christy’s” Son q
Winning Way
In The Clouds

Takes Up , Flying? Instead
Of Parental Baseball;

Interview Follows

Christy Mathewson Jr., '27, is win-
ning his way in the clouds, according
to an interview with the son of Buck-
nell’s famous basebal! star, publishetl
in a recent edition of the Buffala Eve-
ning News.

“Christy” is spending several days
in. Lewisburg visiting relatives and
his brothers in Phi Gamma Delta be-
fore leaving for Mitche] Field where
he has been assigned to duty with |
the United States Air corps.

The interview with Mathewson as
reported in the Buffalo Evening News
follows: |

Every bareball fan who remembers
that other Christy, “Big Six,” and |
there are many thousands, will be
interested in his modest, able son,
and will wonder, perh&ps, why this
Jad of 23 didn’t seek a career in base- |
ball rather than in the air.

“Don't you think that if you had |
taken up baseball, just your name |
would have guaranteed success?” |
asked the boy.

Doesn't Rely on Father's Fame

“Well, maybe,” was his thoughtful
answer. ‘But wouldn't it have been
awful to have the fans always point-
ing me out as Christy Mathewson’
son? It wouldn’t be me. you see. It
would be my father’s name.”

Young Christy’s rather seriot
elaxed into a friendly grin
“Anyway,” he exclaimed, “i'm the
world's worst ball player. Gosh, you
ought to see me at it.”

“The first flight he ever took was
at Curtiss field, in 1927. He went up
with a friend, Eugene Keet, who toon
a course in flying at the field. A
month or so later Christy took a half

last year.

The following is taken from the |
Swarthmore Phoenix:° “

The rule of the Board of Managers
which forbids women to smoke was
repealed recently at the November
meeting of the Board. At the same |
time the petition of the Women’s Stu-
cent Government Association for 1!
smoking room on the campus was de-
nied. The Board resolution is as fol-

Friends has discouraged the use of
tobacco. The Board of Managers of
Swarthmore College believe in this | #
view and wish in every way to uphold
it, It has been the tradition of the
Society that concerted opinion is often
more effective thnn definite rules.
With this tn mind the Board of Man- |
agers urges the students at Swarth-
more College to avoid the use of
tobacco, but proposes to leave the de-
cision to each individual.

“The Women’s Student Government
has petitioned the Board to abrogate
the rule against smoking by women.
Acting under the belief that by con-
certed effort to discourage the use of
tobacco greater progress can be made
in that direction than in other ways,
it is resolved that it is the sense of
the Board of Managers of Swarth-
more College that the Board rule
against smoking by women be re-
pealed and that the petition from
Women’s Student Government be re-
ferred to the Faculty and Adminis-
tintive Officers of the College.

“Be it further resolved that the re-
quest of the women students for the
designation of a speciile room for
smoking be denied.” \

YOUR ALMA MATER
WELCOMES YOU, ALUMNI

Bucknell University is proud t
have its graduates return to Lewi
burg this week-end for the biggest
event in the school year—Homecom-
jng. Administration «and faculty
members are glad to have this oppor-
tunity to greet the men and women
Who have done much to increase the
prestige of the University.

Undergraduates are particularly
pleased to see the almuni return, not
enly beause a school holiday has been
‘declared in celebration of the event,
but also because they are glad to re-
wew those friendships which are the
biggest things in college life.

This year, for the first time in its
history, Bucknell will have an open
house for all alumni. Carl 1. Mill-
ward, '06, superintendent of the Mil-
ton public schools and chairman of
the Homecoming committee, reports
that the fraternities are giving him
splendid cooperation in arranging to
hold open house for all Bucknell men
tomorrow afternoon. Bucknell grad-
uates will receive a cordial weleome
at all fraternity houses on the cam-
pus, no matter whether the alumni
are fraternity or non-fraternity men.

This action represents the reneral
feeling that prevails here at. Bucknell
at Homecoming and throughout the
year. Your alma mater welcomes you,
alumni?

Returning alumni will find that the
University has been growing and ex-
panding in all directions. Those
coming for the conference will attend
an annual function which has kept
pace with the University’s growth.
Each year these educational meetings
have inereased their scope and the
growth in attendance has been pro-
portionate. Their success has been
hard-earned and well deserved.

Bucknell is glad to have a con-
structively-minded educational confer-
enee on her campus.

BEAT STATE!!

If Bucknell can down its most —4

noon, the members of the senior class |
will graduate without seeing Bucknell
lose a single game to Penn State in
the four years of their college course.
For the first time in the history of the
University, Bueknell will have an op-
portunity to score four straight wins
over State.

If Bucknetl wins on Saturday, the
class of °31 can beast of something
that even the most optimistic of un. |
dergraduates would not have dured to |
think about back in ‘90 or ‘96.

On: paper, the Bisons look about
twenty points better than their visi-
tors. The decisive victory over Get- |
tysburg on Saturday made Bisou
stock boom immensely, but the team |
andthe undergraduates remember that
State will be back on the rebound af-
ter that Colgate defeat, and that |
means trouble!

Again, there have been whispers
that Coach Bob Higgins has been
saving his men, pointing them es-
pecially for this tussle! Which is
something to think about. It ts par-
ticularly galling to be defeated three
‘ears in a row by a “small college”
pponent, and State is desperate!

If the Bisons hope to win, they
inust avoid all trace of overconfidence.
Gettysburg is not Penn State, and the
Bisons must play as they have not
played so far this year if they are to
top the enraged Lions,

SHOWING THE WAY

The women of the sophomore clas
have shown good taste and commend
ble judgement in the formulation of
the rules for freshman girls this year.
They have demonstrated that they
clearly recognize that requiring the
members of '34 to appear
ridiculous in the eyes of upperclass-
men can be of little help in the
orientation of the frosh.

To the Editor:

| Anyone who attended Cap and Dag-

lof “The Cat and the Canary” last
Thursday must have been pleasantly
surprised at the excellence of
performance.

Those who saw it came away satis-
fied that a new day had arisen in

ed away regtet their lack of interest.
That this latter class missed one of
lthe best plays of recent years here

of opinion.

The Cat is still the topie of idle
conversation on the campus. Buck-

STATE INVADES HERE

(Continued from Page 1)
before 12:30. The return train will!
leave here Saturday at 10 p. m.

So that Bucknell football players
will not be disturbed by the noise and

confusion of the week-end, Coach Carl

Snavely will take his men to Berwick
on Friday, where they will spend the
night. The team will return to Lew-
isburg early Saturday afternoon.
Penn State players will not arrive
here until Saturday morning.

Attendance at Saturday’s game
will exceed any mark set in central
Pennsylvania. Bucknell’s large sta-
dium has made it possible for the
fans to secure seats at the last min-
ute. Officials of the Athletic Asso-
ciation predict that 24,000 may be on
hand for the kickoff at 2:15, although
the mail order s#le has taken care of
only two-thirds that number.

High Schools Send Players

Nearly four hundred high school
football players have accepted the in-
vitation of the Athletic Council to be
guests at the game. Among the
nearby schools that will be represent-
ed in the stands are Canton, Hughes-
ville, Northumberland, Danville, Sun-
bury, Shamokin, Picture Rocks, Wat-
sontown, Middleburg, Bellefonte,
Selinsgrove, Reinerton, Freeburg, and
possibly Milton. To the Chagrin Falls
team, near Cleveland, Ohio, will go
the honor of travelling the greatest
distance for the game. Fourteen
players will come with Frank Stan-
ton, Bucknell star in the early past
of the century.

Saturday’s game will be the twen-
ty-second between State and Buck-
nel]. At no time has a tie game been

and the Bisons 7. The game is the
first to be played at Lewisburg by |
these teams since 1909.

room in Lewisburg has been reserved
for week-end visitors, except a few in!
private homes. Many alumni and
guests will spend Friday and Satur-

EXPLAINS TOPIC
OF CONFERENCE

Gist of Creative Education
Is That Pupil Produces
Something Of His Own

EDUCATIONAL CIRCLES

STRESS MOTIVATION

Creative education, the topic of the
eonference on education, was expliin-
ed by Dr. Frank Davis, of the depart-
ment of education, in an interview
today.

“The gist of creative education is
that the pupil shall produce some-
thing of his own,” he said. “Forner-
ly, education was conceived to be a
system whereby the pupil was expect-
ed only to give back: what his teacher
or his textbook had told him,
cational

Fdu-
cireles used to emphasize
motivation, now they lay stress on

He can produce for himself,
Condtiets Classes in Music

“One of the best known examples
of modern creative education is found
in the elusses in music conducted hy
Satis N. Coleman in the Lincoln
School, New York. Here the children
make their own instruments, and
write their own music Other ex
amples of actual creative work are
found in schools where students writ
and present their own plays.

“Wugh Mearnes has written a book
entitled ‘Creative Youth’ in which he
aliscusses the modern munifestatior
of the creative urge in a literary
way; ¢. g., poems, stories, ete., pro-
dueed by young, people without adult
stimulation. This man has been so
successful in his chosen field that he
was called to New York University lo
head the first departmentt of creative
education of any teacher-training
school in this country.

Written Voluminously

“Philip Cox also of New York Uni
versity has written voluminously on
this question. His book, ‘Creative
School Control,’ published three years
ago, showed how school control could
be made creative on the part of |
pupils. Pupils organizing through
their own interest, are doing a defi- |
nite creative work.

“It is discussion of such educational
interests as I have spoken of that will
occupy the conference. The prospec
this year point to a highly suceessful
meeting. The response from the
field have been better than ever and |
the expressions of good will more
frequent than ever before.”

Dean McConn Defends.
Social Fraternities,

|

Does Not Censure Collegians
For Avowing Themselves
Non-Intellectual

When Dean ‘Max MeConn, of Le-
high, published his rapid-selling vol-
ume “College or Kindergarten” he
expressed a good many truths which
had never before been said in quite
so understandable a way. Sinee then
he has followed up his ideas on what
a college is, and what a college should
be, with other articles which head for
the same goal, but from different
angles.

In “Tired Business Men of the
Campus,” in the North American Re-
view, he defends the Greek letter men
of the social fraternities. Most of
these men are personable fellows, he
finds, and agreeable. They live com-
fortably, and devote themselves chief-
ly to outside activities, with a little
incidental attention to studies. For
this he does not censure them, be-
cause these men get more out of their
outside activities than they do from
the old style type of education.

Many Enrolled

Over 800,000 students are enrolled |
in colleges, and it is not meant that
all of them should seek intellectual-
ity. They are after success in the
“go-getter” sense of the word, and
the majority of them are not “high- |
brows.” = According to MeConn, our
colleges are serving two very differ:
ent groups: “a minority who are sens |
tellectually gifted, and carry on the
older college tradition; and a large |
majority who are avowedly non-in-
tellectual. The fraternities have be-
come the stronghold and chief agency

: of the new majority education.”

Finally, Dean McConn tramps the

‘iden that fraternities are undemoera-

tie. He snaps his fingers at the
thought, saying that the fraternal ef-
forts have been responsible for our
colleges devoting themselves to “the
democratic object of training practi- |

By 49-0 Score, Saturday,

The Bucknell Buby Bisons trimmed
the Western
Saturday, to the tune of 49-0, in a

Miryland Frosh last

game which proved to be nothing
more than a light workout.

The first score came in the midd|:
of the initial chukker when, after a
steady march down the field, Myers
plunged through center for a touch
down, This proved to be the inspira-
tion needed by the team, and from
then on the boys scored at will. Af-
{ter a series of first downs, Verhey
earried the ball across the goal line
for the second score. In the closing
minutes of the half, Meyers gave a
beautiful exhibition of broken-field
running on a sprint from the 50-yard
Jline for a touchdown. With three
mien between himself and the goal, he
twisted, turned, and straight armed
his way through the trio and scored.

Coming Tilt; 25,000 Expected

T’enn State with three victories, a
tie, and a crushing defeat as her rec-
ord for the season, comes to Memo-
rial Stadium, Tfomecoming Day, with
revenge in her heart. Nothing would
please the Lions better than to claw
the Herd to bits on the green of Me-
morial
Hiison alumni. Penn State has had a
mediocre season thus far under the
guidance of Bob fliggins, her new
coach.

A Bucknell defeat would

Victory would be sweet to the Lions,
for Bucknell has triumphed over them
in the last three meetings of — the
teams. Last year Bucknell scored a
brilliant 27 to 6 vietery over Hugo

Bucknell was unbeatable that day.

Joe Miller, fullback, Jack Livezey,
halfback, and Thomas Evans, half-
back, are other backs who will try
eracking a Bucknell line for the last
time. All these seniors will have a
grudge to work off when the teams
stack up against each other. Bob
iliggins will put in the field a veteran
| team, composed for the most part of

heartened by the showing of the team
against Gettysburg. No one expect-

that had conquered Villanova and Le-

The second half proved to be more
of a slaughter than the firat. Hepler

lresult that Bucknell’s running attack

line was torn to shreds. Coach
Snavely had a seemingly endless
string of capable backs to rush into
the play. Few backfields have such
human battering rams as Hinkle and
Mezza; few can boast of such great

14 FIRST DOWNS

Backfield Smashes Bullet Lines;
Hinkle, Ross, Mezza, Together
Gain 158 Yards

Bucknell rolled up 14 first downs
te two for Gettysburg in Saturday's
great victory. Bucknell’s backs
smashed through the highly touted
Gettysburg line at will. Three Bison
backs, Hinkle, Ross, and Mezza ac-
counted for 158 yards among them.

Bucknell was woefully weak in her
overhead game, completing only two
passes out of nine attempts. Get-
tysburg completed three of six, for
6O yards, the longest, of 45 yards,
coming in the last period. One of
Bucknell’s successful tosses resulted
in a touchdown by Brumbaugh.

Bucknell was penalized 55 yards to
46 for Gettysburg. Most of the Bul-
let penalties were for offside, forthe
Gettysburg linemen offended — fre-
quently.

Above are five members of the junior class at Pennsylvania State College, who play

an important part on the first string eleven.

They will all be eligible for play next sea-

son, and by that time should have developed into a quintet of players of no mean ability.
Lasisch and Snyder add plenty of power to the backfield, while Curry, DeCindis, and
‘“Puddy” Gillard help to give the forward wall a drive that has been lacking in Penn

State lines for some years.

Lasich was the only State backfield man last year who was

able to do anything of any importance against the Bisons, his sporadic center smashes
wreaking havoc on occasions. He will have to be watched on Saturday.

LAWRENCE GOULD,
NOTED EXPLORER,
WILL SPEAK HERE

Second in Command to Admiral
Byrd to Present Pictures of
Antarctic Expedition

TALK SECOND FEATURE
ON ARTIST COURSE

Dr. Lawrence Gould, second in com-
mand to Admiral Byrd tn the re-
cent exploration in the South Pole
area, will speak here Tuesday even-
ing, November 18, under the auspice:
of the Bucknell Artist Course. Ar-
rangements are being made to have
the noted Byrd explorer present lus
lecture and motion pictures in the
Lewisburg High School auditorium.

Doctor Gould will rank with tha
fceremost explorers of all times, and
because of his being next to Com-
mander Byrd in the recent expedition,
his story of adventure will have spe-
cial appeal. Doctor Gould is a form-
er professor of geology at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. He had charge
of the geographical work of the Put-
nam expeditions to Greenland and to
Raffenland. Adiniral Byrd says
that Gould's geological work with his
expedition is one of the most notable
features of the entire exploration.

Popular as Lecturer

“Larry” Gould, as he was known
to the Byrd group, is a popular lec-
turer, for he is a popular person—
young, adventurous, colorful, with a
decided flair for expressing his scien-
tifie observations in a fresh and un-
usual way. It is said that no one
except Admiral Byrd himself could
aive such a comprehensive view of
the expedition to the Antartic.

Gould is a photographer as well as

a geologist, explorer, and lecturer.|ccnvention hall while the Sigma Chil State’s forward wall on. the

He will bring to Bucknell a series of
slides he has especially prepared, and
he will also show selected mation

will appear, to install a motion pic-
ture machine, projector, and screen
for this event.

Nine students, members last year

Prominent Men Speak
Outstanding among the speeches of

Pinchot, Hemphill, Lewis, Fisher,

of Dean J. Hillis Miller, the Rev. B.
W. Barrett, Attorney Miller A. John-

barger, of Mifflinburg.

After the nominations had been
| elenea, the balloting began. At first
the votes were scattered, but by the
fourth ballot only three candidates
remained in the running—Moschisker,
Lewis, and Fisher,

At first the convention resembled a
gathering of noisy hoodlums rather
than a serious meeting. However, by
the time the balloting started, it as-
sumed the appearance of a reel poli-
tical assembly.

At 11:45 o'clock the cigars and
convincing arguments of Lewis’ sup-
porters prevailed, and he received the
nomination on the fifth and final bal-
lot.

Dr. F.G. Ballentine
Discusses Virgil’s
“Aeneid” In Lecture

2000th ~=Anniversary Of Birth
Of Author is Appropriate
Time for Comment

‘The 2000th anniversary of the birth
of the poet Virgil which was widely
eelebrated in Italy a week ago, made
particularly appropriate Dr. F. G
Ballentine’s discussion of the Aeneid,
4m the fifth lecture of the world lit-
erature course.

The “Aeneid,” Dr. Ballentine said,
is uneven in execution and inconsist-
ent. Virgil, who died before being
able to revise and polish off the poem,
wished to have it burned. - The plot
f the poem deals with the destruc-
tion of Troy and the flight of Aeneas
to Italy where he founded the Roman
race.

i Dido Great Heroine

Dido, the greatest heroine of all
Latin works and the most human of
his characters was created by - Virgil
ir the first part. In perfect foil to
her, with her obedience to her desires,
is Aeneas, above all obedient to the
gods. The characters of the Aene
are all drawn with individuality.

Virgil's own personal tastes are
perhaps hest represented by — his
“Eelogues,” ten short pastoral poems
which reflect his love of country life,
and the “Georgics” which treat on
agriculture.

The spirit of Virgil, said Dr. Bal-
lentine had best been caught by Ten-
nyson who spoke of him as a singe:
“of wheat and woodland, tilth and

vineyard, hive and horse and head.”

Pr. Willinm MeClelland, of Saint

“The voices of a university,” he

Professor McClelland briefly de

vices of a university may be heard
nywhere in the old buildings and
court yards, it is here, in the old
stone, ivy-covered chapel, that they
are clearest.” ;

develop these possibilities and enable Bucknell men and women to participate
in these healthful winter activities. This article suggests that it would
easily be possible to develop several different outdoor winter sports, ani

provide tentative schemes for their development.

have been made to enclose Loomis
Field with embankments, and flood it
for skating and hockey when freezing
weather comes. The expense that
would be involved in this scheme is
a barrier to its realization, though we
‘helteve Loomis Field would give us
very good skating pond. The west
side of the field is slightly higher
than the east, necessitating consider-
able work and expense in building an
embankment to compensate for the
difference. For the present it seem:
that plan will have to be laid aside
us a possibility for the more distant
| future.
Plans for Skating Pond
Last winter Professor F. E. Burpee
tried to make a skating pond by
flooding a meadow west of the sta
dium. Results were encouraging, and
the flooding of this meadow, which
is on college property, is a promising
possibility. The pond ts on the right
side of the road to the golf course,
and is just beyond the stadium. The
stream traversing this ground fur-
nishes sufficient water for the pur-
pose, and is enclosed by embankments
or three sides. A dam built across
the fourth side high enough to back
up the water would be the only sig-
nificant item of expense involved in the
project, and the cost would be rela-
tively little at that. A dam could be
built so as to provide for an overflow
and controls to regulate the wate:
supply when flooding became neces-
sary. A good skating pond like this
would be excellent for
both girls and boys.

Thus far skiing has received little

| eames as an accepted sport. Par-

ticipation in it has been very slight.

STEPPING

“Berkley Square”

A Dramatic Review

By Kenneth L. Haines, '31

Let us speak of “Berkley Square”
—of hoops and wigs, and again of
modern things; of London in the
1740's, and again in 1928. In short,
let’s speak of John Balderson’s ro-
mantic play which js on the stage at
the Forrest theatre in Philadelphia,
and which will continue there for two
weeks more.

It is one of those dramas of which
you have nevér seen the like before.
In substance, it concerns a solitary-
minded young man in love with the
past—the past which he reads about
in the diaries of his ancestors. ‘Time,
he believes, is nothing, and he has
the fantastic notion that it would be
very easy for him to take up resi-
dence in Berkley Square 150 years
back. He does so. Snddenly, the
ancient house of his forebears is in-
habited by costumed figures speaking
and acting in a very different civiliza-
tion. These people cannot understand
him, and he learns to think them
beasts—all except one. He falls in
love with her.

Herein lies the tragedy; a modern
young man in love with a maiden of
long ago. His love is so genuine that
he cannot share it with anyone else.
So when he finally does return to the

present, he can no longer delude his *

intended bride.

“Berkley Square” is beautifully
written, staged, nnd acted. Jt is a
strange mixture of Sheridan and
O'Neill; it ranges, during its seven
scenes, from drawing room comedy
to imminent tragedy; it cannot be
compared with any one other drama.
I: is one of those theatrical phenom-
enons to be seen by drama lovers,

Blowing Clear. Joseph C. Lincoln,
Cape Cod story-teller number one
has augmented his long list of New
England adventures with another
novel of merit: “Blowing Clear.”
It tells of a father who is changed
by a son; of a son who is changed
by his father. But of course it’s
done in that fetching Lincolnesque
manner which makes each new
novel outsell the last. There is
love for the romanticist; adven-
ture for the thrill seeker; and
humor aplenty to fill the chinks.
Get acquainted with those real
characters “Hi,” “Lo,” and “Jaek”
at “Seven Up” cottage.

The Third New Yorker Album is a
social event of the season which
has been eagerly awaited by col-
legians and other social aesthetes
ever since the last album was pub-
Ushed by Doubleday, Doran. The
album contains reproductions from
those drawing gems which are
found weekly in “The New Yorker,”
and which compete most potently
with those of “College Humor.” The
humor of our follies and absurdities
is laughable enough without pic-
torial representation. But when
such artists as Peter Arno get to
seratching take-offs on these said
follies, they become  boisterously
amusing. This new album, like the
family album of yore, will save any
party from boredom.

Rogue Herries, the latest book writ-
ten by Huge Walpole, ean best be
described by saying that it seems to
be a painting. Every word and
sentence blend to form a colorful
whole. There is more action, and
the plot moves faster than in many
of the other books written by this
author. his is the tale of the life
of Rogue Herries, a man who wish-
ed to be individual, who was in-
dividual, and who suffered the con-
sequences of not running with the
common‘ herd, by being completely
ostracized by it.

SEVEN GAMES PLAYED
IN MEMORIAL STADIUM |

Much discussion has been overheard
this week by inquiring reporters as |
to the Bucknell Homecomings of the
past. The following information has |
been furnished us by the Alumni Of-
fice, |

Bueknell’s first Homecoming was in|
1921 when Lafayette won the game,
20-7. The next year the Bisons play- |
ed Muhlenberg as the alumni reunion {
attraction and won the game easily,
33-6. The third year, 1923, Lehigh |
was tied 7-7 as the final game on the
old Loomis Field and the last season |
here of Coach C. W. P. Reynolds.

In 1924 the stadium was opened by
the first Moran-coached Bucknell team
and ‘Lafayette scored 21 points after
Captain J. W. Foster, '25, had made
the first score in the giant “U’’ by |
placing a neat dropkick over the bur. |
The game ended 21-8. Moran coach-
ed two more years at Bucknell and
the Homecoming games under _ his
regime were Huskell Indians, 0-0, and
Lehigh, 27-0. This last game was
the first Homecoming victory in the
stadium.

In 1927, Carl Snavely took over the
veins of the Bison machine and his
teams have played four Homecoming
attractions in the following order:

1927-—Bucknell, 3; W. and J., 19.

1928—Bucknell, 0; Lafayette, 0.

1929—Bucknell, 6; W. and J. 14.

1980—Bucknell, 19; Penn State, 7.

Roper, Princeton coach, praised the

the season, after they had run up
three touchdons on his Princeton
Tigers in the first half of a practice
game. But Roper’s praise hasn't
meant a successful season to the Main
Line force, and Princeton’s subsequent
work in her games has not made Vil-
lanova's practice-game showing too
spectacular.

Gettysburg Win Costly

Gettysburg’s victory was a costly

of Morgan and Highfield, star backs,

a Bucknell defeat will not only re-

Bucknell and Gettysburg played to
a 2-2 tie in an extra period socecr
encounter on Loomis Field last Satur- | TACKLE DOES WELL
day.

The Orange and Blue booters got
off to a fast start, netting two goals
jn a first period offensive drive. A
third goal was scored, but was dis-
allowed by the referee, who detected
a player offside on the shot,

In the second half, Gettysburg re-
tumed to the field with a revaniped
combination. The Bullet's first tally |
was the result of a pass frem their
jeft to right wing. The second mark-
er came in the fourth quarter when
the Battlefield forwards evaded the
Bison fullbacks and took the ball into)
scoring distance.

The game began with Gettysburg
kicking off into the wind. The Bisons
soon got possession of the ball, and
began a sustained attack on the Get-
tysburg goal. The play continued to
be carried on in the Bullet’s end of
the field for the entire first half. The
Bucknell halfbacks played a fine de
fonsive game during this time, giving
the forward line the ball time after
time.

The defensive play of the Bison
Dbneks during the last two cantos was
not of the high quality displayed dur- |
ing the first half. This was largely
due to the fact that all three of the
halfbacks were suffering from leg in-
juries. ;

conversation for the last few weeks. |
The success of the team has not been
due to superior ability, but to the

the winning pate at which the boys
have been traveling, and will be a
big asset next year, when they don |

Contrary to the idea that low scho- |
lustie averages are usually shown by
football men, each frosh on the team
tates high in his studies. With the
exception of two, every man on the |
team was in the upper three-fifth of

One element that may hinder the

While this will be a big service to the

General Tasker Howard Bliss, who
died early Sunday morning at the
Walter Reed hospital in Washington,
D. C., from an intestinal ailment, was
au member of ‘the class of 1873 of the
University at Lewisburg, now Buck-
nell. He spent his boyhood in Lewis-
burg and is remembered by a few of
the older residents. In 1916 he wa
given the degree LL. D. by Bucknell.

General Bliss was the war-time
chief of staff and a one-time com-
manding general of the army, and led
an active career for more than half
a century in military service. He is

Prominent in Bucknell’s history was
General Bliss’ family. His father,
George R. Bliss, was the first pro-
fessor to teach at the University and
at one time was acting president. The
Bliss family moved to Lewisburg in
1858 and built the house on the
west side of University avenue, now
owned by the McClure family.

In an effort to secure better living

Main, and, if possible, secure some
improvement in these conditions.

At the present time, there are orly

A feature of the

watch tne

came was Peters
yeturn of a Dickinson kickoff. When
{t looked as if he was xbout to break
free for a score, he ws caught on the
Williamsporters’ fifteen-yard line. A
score followed closely upon this ad-
vance, however.

| Priest Gets 2 Touchdowns

The scoring honors went to Priest
who garnered two — six-pointers.
Meyers got another, while Endler
snared a pass to tally the other. The
scoring was evenly divided, with the
yearlings tallying a touchdown in

each quarter. James converted two

extra points to bring the score to 26.

James did almost all of the kicking
for the frosh, and on one occasion
crossed the opposition by tossing a
pass to Endler for a gain of some 25
yards.

There was only one bad feature
that marred the game and that was
ithat four of the regulars were in-
jured. Farina had his bad ankle
twisted, Vehrey was hurt, as was
Dorman and Peters. The full extent
of Peters’ injury is not known, but it
is understood that he will not be able

“Sun” Runs Article

Many other newspapers in this
Vicinity carried regular news stories
about the dedication. But the Wil-
liamsport Sun, in addition, ran a long
urticle in Mr. Bruce Hunt’s fine col
umn ‘“Journies Aside” on “The House
That Pennies Built." This should b
of interest to all Bucknellians and is
reproduced heré through the courtesy

of the Sun. Incidentally, the holly
tree mentioned, which stands in front
of the new Nets: is one of the most
northern holly trees in Pennsylvania,
Mr. Hunt's article follows:

“Visiting Lewisburg a few days ago
we walked out University avenue,
toward the Bucknell University eam
pus, looking for the large holly tree
which is one of the proud possessions
of the college town We almost
missed seeing it, because since we
were last there in the early spring
the old house against which it stood
has been torn down and xnother takes
its place.

The holly remains, evidently ver!
carefully protected during the build
ing operations. It’ stood at the side
of the old house, but the location of
the new building places it in front,
where it will attract more attention.
A sign on the grounds shows that |
landseape architects are in charge of
beautifying the site, and it is appar: |
ent that they realize this fine holly
tree is a distinctive feature which
eamnot be found in many gardens
this far north.

Holly 75 Years Old

The holly, as we related last winter,

quoting Mrs. Mary Bartol Theiss, of |
Lewisburg and Muncy, may be all of |

three quarters of a century old. It

was planted by Dr. Howard Malcom, |
first president of what is now Buek-
nell, who built a fine home on the
site in 1854—the home which went]
to make way for the new Kappa Sig-
ma house.

Dr. Maleom, « southerner of cul-
tivated ‘tastes, was fond of trees and
planted many unusual specimens in
the spacious grounds about his house.
Many of them remain to this day, |
providing a beautiful setting for the
fraternity house.

Toe Malcom house was long one |
of the show places in Lewisburg, and
its passing could not help to cause |
some regret among those who knew}
its past. |

Pennies Built House

They recall that this fine property |
and the mansion Dr, Malcom erect-
ed were acquired through the acev- |
mulation of pennies. At ‘least the
sum of four cents, many times mul-
tiplied, paid for the place. {

Dr. Maleom was a thorough stu-
dent of the Bible. In his own read-
ing of it he was struck with the idea
that a “Bihle dictonary” would be
very useful in assisting others to
read the Book intelligently. To il
this need he wrote such a book.
vasn’t a voluminous affair and oe
author may not have expected muc!
from it, but there proved to be a ee!
mand for just such a work and it met
a ready sale.

The royalty was four cents per
copy and this smajl sum per vook
reached # total which permitted Dr.
Maleom to build his fine home anid |
live in a manner which his aie: }
ss president of the small edueational
institution which Bucknell was in
oe days ,would not have allowed.”

Dr. Harry W. Robbins
Will Give Lecture

On “Paradise Lost” |:

To Tell How and WhyThis Poem
Has Had a Striking |Effect
Upon Poetry and Thought
The influence made upon the thought
of the work and upon blank verse
forms in literature hy Milton's
“Paradise Lost” will be the feature of
the leture to be given by Dr, Harry
W. Robbins tonight, the eighth of the
series in the world literature course.
“The basie reason for choosing the
subjects of the lectures entered in the
course thus far has: not been their
literary greatness, ‘but rather their
effect on the types of world litera-
ture. “Paradise Lost” differs in this
respect since it influenced world
thought rather than world literature.
Ii has inspired no great epie poems
since Milton's time. In general, the
theological and cosmological theories
of the civilized world today, with
only ‘a few exceptions, are those of
Milton,” said Dr. Robbins today.
“Milton, however, exercised a pro-
found influence in the use of blank
verse forms. The type of blank verse
which he used differs from the
Shakespearean form and has’ been
much used by his contemporaries and
by later poets.”
Professor Leo L. Rockwell spoke on
the “Nihelungenlied” last Thursday,in
the seventh lecture of the course.

“Ever sinee you have been here,

are unimportant, unnecessary. Your

critic Burns Mantle gets out year

book a boon to out-of-town drama
followers and lovers,

Besides the condensed versions of
the plays already jotted, there is a
complete record of every

how long in numbers of perform-

to refer to it often, if you're inter-

The course is Prov)

the second semester each year.

In the 1929-30 catalogue this course
is deseribed as follows: “analysis of
dramatic masterpieces and practice in

dramatic interpretation.” In addi-

to be become an important consider-
ation. The “play production” phrase
has been added to the description of
this course in answer to those on the |

does not provide a branch of study of |
this nature.

The study of drama technique was
introduced into English 332 last se-

ing with dog teams day after day in
the ‘teeth of Polar blizzards; these are
the sort of the tales Gould will bring
his hearers Tuesday evening.

Among the many contributions
made by Gould to the expedition was
the trip he conducted to the South
Polar Plateau. Mushing over 1000
miles in sledges drawn by dogs, he
completed the longest trip of this sort
ever attempted in the interests of
purely scientific investigation.

Tt was Gould who kept a journal on
the trip from which much interest-
ing and valuable material has been
obtained. Such an entry as the fol-
lowing gives an insight into the man's
personality: “to the north and south
of us lay Mount Nansen in all its
splendor—his cap of shining ice, his

“blackish shoulders of bare rock loosely

wrapped in a ragged old shawl, and
the whole made glorious by the touch
of the long skilled fingers of the early

| Vocational Guidance Has
| Developed In Last Decade

“During the past few decades, vo-
cational guidance has’ developed to
such an extent that it can no longer
be called vocational, but a guidance
that is more a personnel | service,”
said Dr. Frank G, Davis in his talk
before the Education Club, Tuesday
| evening at eight o’clock, The meect-
ing, attended by more than 40 mem-
bers, was formally opened by Marie
Trunk, '3!, president of the club.

“There are not nearly enough
trained men to fill the posts of coun-
selors in the guidance field,” said Dr.
Davis. "This field is increasing
rapidly. Before 1920, 22 percent of
the cities to whom questionnaires
were sent concerning work in guid-
ance had already employed counse-
lors. After 1920, this percent imount-
ed to 78. It would be well for all
prospective teachers to keep this
fie] of education in mind. It re-
quires infinite patience, resoureeful-
ness, and understanding to fill this
position well.”

At the conclusion of Dean Miller's

“Armistice Day should mean more

With these words, John Plant, physi- |

memories, but to us who were there,

LAST ON THE SCHEDULE

Bisons Have Won One Game,
Tied One, And Lost
Two Tilts

The Bucknell soccer team will en-
deavor to make up for the defeat
suffered last week at the hands of the
Cornell team, when the Orange and
Blue booters meet Navy, Nov. 19, at
Annapolis.

This game will be the last on the
Bison schedule for this year, and a
win would be greatly appreciated by
Bucknell fans. The Navy is report-
ed to be unusually strong, so the
game is sure to be an interesting one.

With a ten day the Bison
booters should be able to go into the
game with full strength. Captain
Pederson’s hip will have a chance to
heal, and Glazier’s knee injury will be
sufficiently well to enable him to get
back in the line-up.

Koster will not be at his wing post
due to the Navy eligibility ruling
which does not permit freshmen to
play against their teams. Biando or
Caballero will probably fill this place
in his stead.

To date, Bucknell has won one
game, tied one, and lost two. A win
over Navy would round out the sea-
son in good shape, considering the
fact that the team is laboring under
the handicap of not having a regular
coach.

Practically the entire team will be
back next year and a good season is
anticipated. An attractive schedule
ix now being arranged for the 1932
campaign.

The Wildeat’s potent paw, loaded
with two big touchdowns in the first
half, could not stop an enraged Bison
whieh countered with two Orange and

Blue scores in the second half to

clinch a 20-14 victory at Brooks Field
in Seranton, Saturday. i

Villanovans were confident of vic-
tory at half time, when everything
seemed rosy, but they had not counted
on facing Clark Hinkle, nor had they
met, as yet, the fighting team which
was Bucknell’s as the second half
opened.

Psychology had its rounds on the
gridiron Saturday. Ammerman went

down on Bucknell’s first offensive
play of the game, but Bucknell didn’t
do a Notre Dame as might have been
expected. Rather, Villanova came
back and played the Bisons off their
feet, using the aerial game to score
twice.
Hinkle Inspires Bisons

Bucknell played football that first
half, but she failed to play great foot-
ball. With Clark Hinkle in the lineup
as the second half opened, Villanova

faced a tiew Bison team which beeanre
a mighty machine before many min-
utes had passed.

Hinkle hurled passes and scattered
Wildeat fur all over Brooks Field as
he slashed through the enemy line.
The big Bison fullback’s play was in-
spirational. 3ison forwards began
to push their opponents out of the
way, as the backs picked the holes
which meant first downs and victory.

Bucknell’s first and last scores were
made on the same type of play, an
off-tackle slice. Ammerman's 71 yard
first-play gallop was a sensational bit
of running which aroused the Villa-
nova Trish. Brumbaugh’s last period
eanter of 28 yards was unexpected
also, for Bucknell had been hitting the
line for a yard or two at a time, and
those 28 yards seemed a long distance

fened. Hinkle’s plunging produced
the second tally.

Reverse Play Gives Touchdown

Bucknell’s whirlwind score in the
first quarter was made on a reverse,
in which Ammerman reecived the ball
from Mezza. Ammerman picked a
nice hole at left tackle, broke through,
and shook off the secondary defense
to get into the open field, where he
easily outran the feeble pursuit.
©) Mezza failed to kick the point.

On the first play after the kickolf,
Trudnak recovered Peterson’s fumble
on the Villanova 33-yard stripe.
Bucknell was unable to gain and was
set back by penalties. Fry kicked

Nikodem nailed Gardner for a 3-yard

loss on the next play, but Casey went

out wide around right end to the

Bucknell 4-yard line where McLaugh-

lin added a yard for a first down. .
Cats Take t Downs

It took the Villanova backs four
downs to make those final 4 yards,
with Casey finally worming his way
through from the l-yard line. Gard-
ner added the point to shove the Wild-
cats ahead 7 to 6.

Stuhldreher’s men started their
second successful attack from their
48-yard stripe where Casey intercept-
ed a pass from Ross. Gardner made
two yards at the line. Casey passed
to Peterson for a 16-yard ‘advance.
Bucknell was penalized for offside,
and successive thrusts at the line ad-
vanced Villanova to the Bison 21-
yard line. TWammond, a forward pass
Specialist, took McLaughlin's quar-
terback post. Villanova went into the
air, with Hammond passing to Gard-
ner at the goal line. Gardner fumbled
after receiving the ball, but Terry,
Wildcat right end, pounced on it for
the touchdown. Gardner again kick-
ed the point. Bucknell started a for-
ward pass attack, but the half time
whistle cut short her efforts.

Bucknell lost no time in starting
her great comeback in the second
half. Villanova was unable to gain
after the kickoff, and Ross took
Peterson’s boot on his 27-yard line.

yard line. Brumbaugh smashed off
tackle for 28 yards to score. Fry
kicked the point.

Bucknell warded off a Wildcat
aerial attack, and took the ball deep
into enemy territory near the end of
the game, but a penalty and an 11-

the game ended with Bucknell in pos-
session of the ball at midfield. Score,

favorite to win over the Bisons. The
first half was closely contested, with
Bueknell missing several excellent
chanees to seore. Koster placed «
hard shot from the corner of the field
which missed by inches. Before the
half was over, Cornell had scored
twice, once on a corner kick and once
when Carvelho dribbled through the
Bucknell fullbacks after receiving 2
pass from his wing.

Cornell Scores Again

In the second half Bucknell braced
somewhat, but Cornell was able to
get one more goal before the third
quarter was ended. This goal was
also the result of a corner kick.
Shortly after the beginning of the
fourth quarter, Williams netted the
ball for Cornell’s fourth goal and his
third of the game.

As the game was nearing a close,
Williams scored again, and Carvelho
followed his example by making good
a free kick from just outside the
penalty area, This concluded the
seoring for the afternoon, and the
game ended with the count 6-0 in
favor of the home team.

Glazier Unable To Play

Bucknell was handicapped by not
having Glazier, regular right half, in
condition to play. Captain Pederson

JOHN GOLD ADVANCES
THEORY ON PLANET

new planet, sent his work to Germany |
where Galle looked for the object and |
found it in the place predicted. This
was Neptune and was found in 1841.

However, there was still an error
in the orbit of Uranus that was not
accounted for by Neptune, and in the
early part of the 20th century Dr.
Lowell made the predicton that a
new planet would be found some-
where outside the orbit of Neptune.
In April of this year an object be
lieved to be the  trans-Neptunian
planet was seen by the Lowell Ob-
servatory. ‘Although the new object
varied greatly from that described by
Pr. Lowell in his notes, the resemb-
lance was sufficient to make astrono-
mers think they had finally foun
Planet X, or Pluto as it has since
been called,

However, out
servatory at the

at the Yerkes Ob
University of Chi
cago they are still skeptical, and
refer to it as the Lowell “object”
rather than a planet. The size
of Pluto is about equal to that of
Mars and its density is approximately
one-ninth that of the Earth. This
latter fact is what is causing the
controversy, for in a letter by Edwin
B. Frost, director of the Yerkes Ob-
servatory to Director Gold, he states,
“Unless its density is very unusual
it could hardly have produced the
purturbations on Uranus which Dr.
Lowell used as a basis for his ealeu-
lations.”

“This,” explained Director Gold,
“As well as certain other phenomena,
lead us to believe that there may still
be another planet beyond Pluto.”

A preliminary student discussion

A similar seminar was held at
Dickinson College on November 2 and

of the Religious Education Associa-
tion, in a letter to the local eommit-
tee, wrote, “The seminar at Dickin-

ference of like nature was held at
Columbia University a year ago and
was very successful.

was retired at the age of 64 after
forty-two years’ hard service,

He was continued on active duty,
however, with the rank of General
and as Chief of Staff until 1920. Dur-
ing that time he was a member of
the Supreme War Council in France
and an active member of the Ameri-
can Commission to negotiate peace.
In 1920 he relinquished the reins of
active duty and was appointed Gov-
ernor of the National Soldiers’ Home
in Washington.

This year, by an act of ‘Congress,
he was commissioned as a full gen-
‘eral in the United States Army.

During his military career of forty-
two years prolonged by a special act
of Congress after he had reached the
age for retirement, General Bliss be-
came known as one of the foremost
soldier-statesmen of his era.

At the conclusion of the World
War, he was awarded the Distingulsh-
ed Service Medal.

He also received numerous decora-
tions of the highest order from
foreign governments, including Great
Britain, France, Belgium; Japan,
China, Italy, and Panama.

ALUMNI TO PUT WREATH
ON MATHEWSON TABLET

1

Station WOR, the broadcasting
station of L. Bamberger and Co.,
Newark, N. J., will broadcast the
Bucknell-Fordham game from the
Polo Grounds in New York, The
broadcast is scheduled to begin
at 145 p. m., Saturday.

The Thundering Herd, 26 members
strong, will migrate eastward tomor-
row morning. The Bisons will leave
the May-Mar at 7:15 for Montandon
where they will entrain for New York
and their clash with the Rams.

The University band will follow at
11:38 tomorrow evening in a special}
coach on the ‘“Williamsporter,” mid-
night express to New York City, and
will arrive there early Saturday
morning. Forty-eight bandmen will
make the trip.

Reports from the Bucknell grad-
uate manager’s office indicate that
the advanced ticket sale has exceeded
all expectations. More than 1000
tickets have been sold here to date.

The members of the Bucknell squad
will stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania.
They will go to the Polo Grounds for
a short work-out tomorrow afternoon.
Coach Snavely announced this morn-
ing that Lobel, Miller, Ammerman,
and Stonebraker will be out of the
line-up, due to injuries received in the
W. and J. game. It is extremely
doubtful whether Goodwin or Marter
will see much action.

Between halves in the game, alumni
will place a wreath on the Mathew-
son Memorial tablet at the Polo
Grounds, where “Christy” won fame
as one of the greatest pitchers base-
ball has ever known.

Old Main Petition
Interests Dr. Hunt;
No Relief Just Now

SENDS LETTER TO MEN
EXPLAINING DECISION

That sanitary facilities in Old Main
may not be improved until next sum-
mer was President Emory W. Hunt's
answer to the petition presented to
him last week by the residents of
Main, who described in the petition
the utterly unsatisfactory conditions
row existing in the building and re-
quested that they be bettered.

The letter from President
follows:

Dear Boys:

I am interested in the petition
whieh has just been presented to me,
end wish to assure you that we sym-
pathize with it. We have not been
unaware of conditions there, and it
has been our purpose to improve them
at the earliest possible date. - This
last summer several thousand dollars
was spent in making those dormi-
teries more comfortable. This only
makes more conspicuous the ‘work
that still needs to be done. We pro-
pose to reach it as soon as possible.

It will be obvious that it is ex-
tremely difficult to accomplish such
changes while the building is in con-
stant use. It may be necessary to
wait until next summer vacation.

You will also recognize that instead
of paying the same rent as students
in the other dormitories to which you
refer, you pay just two-thirds as
much. Howcver, this does not make
us content to leave things as they are.

Yours always,
Emory W. Hunt.

granted in response to several
petitions presented by members
of the student body. The Dean's
statement follows:

Saturday, November 22, is de-
clared a holiday to enable stu-
dents to attend the Bucknell-
Fordham game, with the under-
standing that absences from elass
on Friday, November 21, count
triple. This is in accordance
with previous action taken by the
Bucknell faculty in authorizing a
half holiday to enable students to
attend the Bucknell-Penn State
game.

Students planning for the
week-end should remember that
absences from classes Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday count
triple, because they immediately
precede the Thanksgiving vaca-

these conditions could be remedied.

“The State Police should be a uni-
fied body selected from men of high
mental and moral character, and
should be free from any interference
from political agencies,” said Major
Adams. “At present the police are
disunified; they are made up of men
who are not equipped mentally and
morally to perform the acts that they
are called upon to perform; and they
are hindered by political interfer-
ence.”

Cites Conditions Then and Now

In the period that followed the lec-
ture, Dean R. |. Rivenburg asked
Major Adams to tell the students
about the conditions before and after
the passing of the prohibition law as
he had seen them during his 25 years
in the police service. Major Adams
replied that he did not think that
prohibition was a moral question,
sinee it did not better the morals of
anyone to have the temptation put
out of his reach,

“Before the Jaw was passed,” he
said, “I saw poverty and hunger and
disorder in the mining towns. Now
the houses are clean, the women and
children well clothed, there are radios
in every home, and a car in almost
every garage.

COMMERCIALIZE WJBU

Bucknellians interested in the fu-
ure of the University’s broadcasting
Station, WJBU, sre expressing much
oneern over a recent announcement
by the Federal Radio Commission in-
dicating that unless a station is giv
ing valuable service to the commun-
ity, its license will not be reissued.
The Commission has announced that
it “is of the opinion that a station
must operate continously, not spas-
modically for special purposes. The
ublic must receive the maximum
benefit to which it is entitled from the
continous use of the frequencies as-
signed to broadcasting.”

Since WJBU cannot improve

* and increase its programs without
additional funds, the possibility
of losing the station's license
must be faced. The Board of

‘Trustees cannot be expeeted to

increase its appropriation and

there is no reason why it should
when the money can be secured
by other means.

The solution to the problem
Ties in the acceptance of paid ad-
vertising for WJBU. Other col-
lege stations are beginning to do
commercial work in order to de-
fray expenses and to increase and
improve programs, Through this
means, WJBU would be enabled
to increase its total hoars of
broadcasting to at least 15 a week.
With funds available for the pur-

chase of better equipment, the sta-
tion could put on better programs.
A part of the revenue might well be
used to pay students and faculty
members who have expressed their
willingness to put on programs, but
who cannot now afford to do so.

The large commercial stations can
readily satisfy the demand for enter-
tainment and casunl knowledge. The
college radio station should have as
is task the development of a finer
techinque in radio education. Unless
WIBU undertakes a definitely con-
structive educational program, the
station can be of but little value.

Aceeptance of commercial work
will provide funds for better equip-
ment, Jonger hours of operation, and |
improvement of the broadcasting pro- |

Verse tnkes care of our poets, The
Belle Hop absorbs our humorists.
But what of our essayists and our
fiction writers?

The immediate objection to insti-
tuting a magazine devoted to purely
literary considerations here is that
the above mentioned publications have
great dithculty in finding members of
the student body eager to contribute
and that possibly the same situation
would arise on the founding of the
suggested magazine.

Undoubtedly, writing is one of the
most familiar and pleasant means of
self-expression. There may be many
potential Christépher ‘Morleys or
Edna Ferbers stalking about our
eampus, who but await the opporttun-
ity to burst into print, and will do so
if given the opportunity. A maga-
zine for the literary-minded would
be welcomed at Bucknell. We hope
to hear more about it.

Columbia University, although gen-
erally conceived to be situated in the
original seat of iniquity, New York
City, boasts a freshman class as pure
as the driven snow. According to
data revealed last week, the repre-
sentative Columbia freshman does not
smoke, drinks two or more glasses of
milk daily, regularly cats spinach,
lettuce and broecoli. We think these
remarkable children are a credit to
their home training.

bomb which exploded in his face when
he opened the door of his car. This
college racket is on the up and up

Any member of the department of
English who obfects to the use of
slang in student themes is likely to
be answered by a snappy retort ap-
proved by no less an authority than
Dr. Frank H.  Vizetelly, so-called
dean of lexicographers. Dr. Vizetelly
says that there’s a certain sincerity
about slang that frees it altogether
from snobbery, that it leaves very

«little room for doubt, that when a

man calls you a dud, a wet blanket,
or a ealamity howler you know what
he means We do not advise stu-
dents to address any member of
aforesaid department as a dud, a wet
blanket or a calamity howler. Stick
to the king’s English and snobbery!

Personal Opinion

Dear Editor:

Bucknell is at present well repre-
sented journalistically by the Buck-
nellian and the Belle Hop, but I won-
der if some of the student body has
not felt a need for « third publica-
tion.

Neither the Bucknellian nor the
Nelle Hop can extend its field to in-
clude the more literary type of work
for which some stuilents are best.
suited. There are any number of
elever and interesting themes snb-
mitted to the department of [English
worthy of publication. The authora
are capable of doing more and better
work of the same sort if encouraged

—— | by the hope of publication.

PROSE IN PRINT

The letter to the editor concerning |
a need for a literary magazine at
Bucknell is a concrete expression of
a desire long felt on this campus.
At present, Bucknellians with literary
inelinations have three mediums
through which they may publish: the
BRacknellian, the Bucknell Book of
Verse and the Belle Hop. These three
publications might well be supple-
mented by a fourth. 4 wm

Diseriminating theatre-t rotlers
have made it difficult for people lo-
cated in the provinces to get a look
in on the top-notch shows by corner-
ing all the seats in advance. But
don't let that daunt you; people
have been known to return tickets.
Try these headliners first: “Smiles,”

combination; the Guild’s “Roar

afloat on real water; “Hello Paris,”
with bewhiskered “Chie” Sales of
“The Specialist” fame making this
musical comedy really rich; and
“Green Pastures,” for which a 20-
seat block has been reserved for
Bueknellians.

many of us read as a book. Being

Fine and Dandy, with Joe Cook at the
helm guiding Donald Ogden
Stewart's funny dialogue, is an ex-
cellent musical offering. The ab-

Mr. Cook uses as workman and

facedness impossible.

Twelfth Night—yes Shakespeare’s--
is the finest of this bard’s plays
which have been «done lately. Jane
Cowl is greatly responsible, but the
setting has a good bit to do with it:
a huge book stands to one side of
the stage; its pages are opened by
the jester, Feste; at each opening,
a new scene is revealed.

On the Spot is Edgar Wallace’s ver-
sion of Chicago rackets antl gang-

ments happen atop a pent-house,
where a woman, for one reason or
another, commits suicide. Despite
this there is so much good humor
that one suspects the playwright of
satirization,

Stories—1930 rates as another of
those really indispensable books,
due to the selective genius of its
editor, Blanche Colton Williams.
Doubleday, Doran publishes her
book every year, containing the
best short stories printed in Ameri-
can magazines during that time
Five hundred dollars is given for
the best story chosen. This year’s
selection resulted in a tie between
W. R. Burnett’s “Dressing Up"
from Harper's, and William M.
John’s “Neither Jew Nor Greek.”

Mr. Burnett will be remembered
for “Little Caesar’ and the more
recent “Iron Man.” Mare Con-
nelly, whose “Green Pastures” has
caused no end of commotion in New
York and the provinces, is also rep-
resented by the Collier's story
“Coroner’s Inquest,” for which he
received $100 for having his story
placed in this collection.

By virtue of their staying ability,
“Strictly Dishonorable,” an all-night

about a girl with a puritanical father,

KNOX KNOCKS HUMOR HEADS
Dear Gulliver:

Who in heaven's name wrote the
headlines for the sports page of the
Backnellian last week? He may be
wonderful, but 1 think he’s wrong.
Evidently he’s trying to make his
headlines sound smart and clever—
AND HE DID.

For instanee, reeall that brain child
“Nibble Navy.” Obviously this is
very, very clever, whether it is a fit-
ting allusion to make to a soccer
game or not.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1930,

Again consider “Hinkle \Hammers
Those Wildeats;” a mixed metaphor,
we'd say.

Then there is that brilliant effort,
“Brumbaugh, On Touchdown Canter,
Has Second Longest Run.” = In my
mind “canter” is about as appropriate
a term as “singlefoot” would be to
apply to a college halfback. At first
we weren’t sure whether this was
describing a football game or the
Union County Horse Show.

Finally, We look at “Local Track-
men Sharpen Limbs for Field Race.”
This one baffles explanation.

However, since the Bucknellian is
going in for this clever stuff, why not
he consistent? Why hide the talent
ot the staff on the inside pages? Let
their efforts appear unashamedly on
the front sheet, making their bow be-
fore the world.

Then we can expect to see heads
like these:

“Bucknell Ballads, Hot
Presses in December.”

“HEY! HEY! FRIDAY FROLICS
IN LARISON HALL!”

“Heinies’ Club Hooks Ten Pledges.”

“Fraternities Kick In Shekels To

CALLOW SPEAKS —
AT FIRST DINNER
GIVEN PLEDGES

Veteran U.P.Coach, Dean Miller,
Dr. Lawson Are Principal
Speakers at Affair

“Remember as freshmen to try to
be as unselfish as you can; that you
have the opportunity to place your
fraternity second to your college,”
urged “Rusty” Callow, veteran crew
coach, and guest speaker at the Y. M.
Cc. A. Inter-Fraternity Pledge Ban-
quet held at the Women’s College
Monday evening.

Opening with the Alma Mater, the
pledges were entertained by a series
of musical numbers presented by the
Men's Glee Club, and by Jean Colvin
and Robert Workman, vocal soloists.
Following the banquet, toastmaster
John Plant introduced the speakers
of the evening, Professor G, B. Law-
son, Dean J. ‘Hillis Miller, and Coach
Russell Callow, who gave the main
talk of the evening.

May Miss Parpose

Recognizing the American fratern-
ity as a valuable factor in education,
Coach Callow pointed out the danger
of its missing its purpose. “I believe
in the institution of the American
college fraternity as being able to do
a great deal of good,” he declared,
“both for its members and its institu-
tion. It can also do a great deal of
harm.

“The ideal of every fraternity is to
place the college first. Fraternity
men often forget this and place their
group’s welfare above that of their
school, I've felt this in my coaching
many times. I’ve found it necessary
to stop the eleetion of a captain of a
team several times when fraternity
politics endangered teams.

Chooses Officers

David Evans, '32, was elected presi-
dent of the Sociological Society at a
meeting of the meinbers held last
week. Harriet Wilson, ’31, was eleet-
ed secretary, and Eleanor Farquhar,
31, was named treasurer.

The society voted to make a socio-
logical survey of Lewisburg. Other
activities will be carried on but will
be subordinate to this main endeavor.

This decision was reached after a
number of the members who had been
interested in particular problems in
the local community coneluded that
any approach to their solution should
be preceded by a comprehensive
study.

| Seminary Sigarettes

A certain ill-famed lady of ancient history is characterized
as loud and stubborn, a woman subtle of heart, with office
hours in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark
night; her feet abiding not in her house, now without, now in
the streets and lying in wait at every corner. The 1900 model
has changed very little. The prize fighters saloon was her '
habitat, her fadeway skirt had almost risen to present heights
and to her progressive habits the tobacco industry is under
deep obligation. She introduced cigarettes to her own sex.

Hold everything. No sudden inferences. The slang of
yesterday is good usage today. By a process of evolution the
modern woman smoker is of much higher type. She has
moved up from the Bowery to Park Avenue, from New York
to Paris and back again. Through the prostitution of the art
of ad writers and artists she has been welcomed into the best
society.

So far, so good. But a few old fashioned folks including
89 percent of Bucknell mothers are still dubious. When the
greed of the filthy weed advertisers begin to advocate pipes
and chewing tobacco for women, we're wondering what out-
cast of society will do their dirty work. Unthinkable? We're
not so sure. Cigarettes in your dainty mouths were just as
repulsive at one time.

The College Inn has everything to lose and nothing to
gain by women smokers. An excursion in religious faith has
always barred the sale of cigarettes at the Inn. You're not
doing us a favor by polluting the atmosphere, scarring up the
furniture and littering up the floor. When you're tempted to
reach for a Lucky, the College Inn invites you to the smoking
car—outside.

Wilson Big Gainer

Clark Hinkle and “Bul” Ammer-

their best efforts were not enough to
match the prowess of “Stew” Wilson,
the President’s star fullback who
scored all his team’s points. It was
Wilson's talented toe that decided the
issue, after Armstrong, returning
Hinkle’s kiek, had dashed back 38
yards to the Orange and Blue two-
yard stripe, from where it was an
easy matter for the giant Wilson to
lug the ball for a touchdown.

Not only was Wilson the offensive
star for the Presidents, but his dead-
ly tackling broke up Bucknell plays
time after time. Statistics reveal
that the big fullback made more
- tackles than any other man on the
years, and lost a lot of prestige in| fold In the last few minutes of the

Fine European Tour
By Means Of Slides

A personally conducted tour by
means of postat slides through Paris,
Nice, Rome, Naples, Pompeii, Swit-
zerland, Germany, and England was
enjoyed by the Campus Club last
Monday evening in the playroom.

Mrs. Elizabeth N. Wright, assist-
ant librarian and one of the conduc-
tors for the Temple Tours, presented
the slides with a short talk to an
audience of over fifty members.

Dispelling the glamor that has al-
ways surrounded Venice for romantic
Americans, Mrs. Wright said, “The
motor launch is rapidly taking the
place of gondolas in Venice.”

Mrs. Wright showed several slides
of the monastery of Cappucini, Rome,
and greatly interested her audience
by saying that all the ornate and
elaborate decorations on the walls of
the monastery were the carved bones
of monks who had died there.

Elaborate Banquet

Delta ta Chi, local Italian fratern-

Alpha Phi Delta, national non-sec-
turian fraternity, Sunday afternoon,
when thirteen members of the local
fraternity were initiated into Alpha
Phi Delta at formal exercises held in
the Delta Eta Ohi house on Market
street. The initiation exercises were
conducted by delegates from the na-
tional fraternity.

Following the initiation, a formal
banquet was held in the Lewisburg |
Club. Dean R. H. Rivenburg, Dean
J. Hillis Miller, members of the fac-
ulty, delegates from the national fra-
ternity, and members of the local |
chapter were present. |

Dean Rivenburg Speaks

Dean Rivenburg spoke on “College
Before Fraternity,” and Dean Miller
gave a short talk on “Culture.” Pro-
fessor Peter Sammartino, of the City

cillor of Alpha Phi Delta, also spoke.

On W.S.G.A. Meeting

Roberta Slifer, ’31, president of W.
S. G. A., in a report of the recent
convention of the Women’s Intercol-
legiate Association for Student Gov-
ernment at New Brunswick, called
attention to the great difference be-
tween the honor system, which gov-
erns the social life of other colleges,
with the purely judiciary system
which exists at Bucknell,

Dr. Sidney A. Cook, professor of
psychology at N. J. C., gave as pre-
requisites for this system the follow-
ing rules: (1) «a few regulations
chosen with care; (2) instruction of
students to grasp this abstract prin-
ciple; (3) cooperation of administra-
tion and faculty; (4) a clear think-
ing, forceful dean who is sympathe-
tic, but not weak; (5) respected and
intelligent leaders; (6) a system of
education of the honor system to be
given to the freshmen; and (7) a
forceful, impersonal judiciary board.

of one-quarter million square miles
and has the highest elevation of an

continent. The temperature of this
far-off land is extreme, there being an
annual temperature of 13 degrees be-
low zero. The lowest recorded tem-
perature taken by the expedition was
73 degrees below zero. Under sigh
conditions it is possible to freeze to
death in five minutes, but impossible
to take a cold.”

Dr. Gould deseribed the establish-
ment of “Little America;” told of
the hardships in raging blizzards ard
the fogs. He reviewed thoroughly
the animal and bird life found there.
Probably the most thrilling descrip-
tions given were of the two geologi-
cal expeditions sent out from the base
at “Little America.”

Byrd Makes Dramatic Rescue

The first of these was an airplane
trip of 400 miles ending in the de-
struction of the plane and a dramatic
rescue of Gould and his companions
by the timely arrival of Commander
Byrd in another plane. .

A trek with dogs and sledge across
the ice terrain resulted in tmportant
geological discoveries and the finding
of a cairn built by Amundsen 18 years
earlier.

“The Triumph Song,” consisting
of two verses and a chorus, was in-

of the Carnegie. Foundation ¢xamt-

Chemical Building Jeecture room on
Tuesday night. Almost every mem-
ber of the faculty was present.

For perhaps two hours. statistical
charts of various sorts were flashed
on the screen, These represented
the results of the examinations along
various lines. There were charts
for individual colleges and for the
entire group of more than 30 insti-
tulions which gave the examinations.
Also, there were charts to show the
results of the examinations of dif-
ferent classes, and some charts even
showed records made by students in
high schools. In like manner, differ-
ent groups of students had been
charted, ws the engineers, the A. B.
students, and so on.

failed to equal if. The charts did
not, however, reveal the identity of
the institutions charted, although 4
special series of slides had been
prepared to show how various classes
and groups compared with one an-
other at Bucknell.

Among the interesting things
made evident by these charts was the
fact that as students specialize along
one given. line, their grades in gen-
eral knowledge and culture seemed
to fall proportionately. Vor in-
stance, the chart showed that in the
various colleges where enginecring is
taught there is an average number
of required hours of work to which
most of the colleges fairly well con-
formed. Their examinations in gen-
eral subjects were not greatly dis-
similar, But in one or two schools
engineering students were required
to do vastly more engineering work
than the average. And in those
schools the showing in general sub-
jects was way below the average.

Perhaps the most signifieant thing
brought ont by the slides was''the
fact that, in general, seniors did not
show as much advancement over

Dy. Griffith attended the Sorbonne

the time since then writing his thesis.
He submitted it to the Sorbonne this
September. It was accepted. Then,
he had to face an examination which
was prepared to try to tear down the
points which he had made in his
thesis. He succeeded in defending
his statements, and thus passed his
examination and reeeived his degree.

The book, “Balzac en ‘Amerique,”

Of all the an-

noyances which might face her daughter in college, however, even the fondest

mother would searcely thiitk of ants.

Yet ants there ure, m practically every

room from the fourth floor of the new dormitory to ‘“Larison elevation.”

At Bucknell the source of these
“Pharaoh’s ants” but popularly called
the postoffice in Larison Hall, though
known.

Perhaps they were brought in on
packages sent by parcel post. At
any rate, many a “coed’s” heart has
been broken upon discovering small
red ants skipping merrily over the
marshmallow icing of the devil’s food
cake that her mother had just sent
her. Since the Larison Hall post-
office is the central point of distribu-
tion in the Women’s College, it is
easy to see how the tiny pests spread
to Harris Hall and the new dormi-
tory.

Originated in Trapies

“Pharaoh’s” ant is the best known
of house ants and has been domesti-
cated so long that its exact origin
ean not be determined, except to place
jt in the old world tropics. In warra
countries the red ant lives in the soil,
but in temperate regions it must live
in heated houses in order to survive.
Undoubtedly, commerce is to blame
for bringing this insect to North

small red ants, technically known as
on the campus “little red devils,” was
how ants got into the postoffice is not

are inflammable, some caution is im-
portant. ‘

Baits, such as small sponges moist-
ened with sweetened water, can be
used to attract the ants. Put in
places where they can easily be
reached, the sponges will prove to be
an irresistable bait. They should be
collected several times daily and the
ants on them destroyed by being im-
mersed in hot water. These baits are
most useful, however, when the pres-
ence of the ants is first discovered,
and the colonies are still few and
small. .
Poison Syrups Effective

Poisoned syrups, which are also
poisonous to human beings and do-
mestie animals, are the most efficient
means of destroying red ants. The
United States Department of Agri-
culture has prepared some formulas
for these syrups, such as the fol-
lowing: “(1) One pound of sugar

Red ants are not so destructive as
they are annoying. They get into
food — especially sugars, syrups,
cakes, candies, and cooked animal
food. Whenever ants discover ar-
ticles like these, the news is somehow

sodium arsenate. The mixture
should be boiled and strained, and
on cooling used with sponges, as al-
ready described. The addition of a
small quantity of honey is said to
add attractiveness to ants. Other

Food Ban Needed

In order tu drive the ants from
the girls’ dormitories, the first step
would be to keep all food out of the
iormitonies. But to bring such :
restriction about would be difficult
nd, in fact, almost impossible. Since
we know what food substances at-
tract these insects to the dormitories,
the ideal solution of the problem
would be to prevent the importation
of such foods. However, it is prob-
able that not all of our four hundred
girls would abide by such a rule.
But it would remedy the situstion if
they woukl clean up promptly all
erumbs seattered on floors, and put

The idea behind
all these solutions is that the ants
will collect the sweet fluids and con-
vey them to their nests; then the
colonies will also die after feeding
upon them.

Some of these destructive com-
pounds are, of course, toa complex
to be prepared in the kitchenettes
of the “Sem;” but surely the “coed”
chemistry “sharks” should be willing
to lend a hand and help to get rid
of these pests. The simpler meth-
ods, such as preparing sweetened
water, any “coed” can follow for
herself. If all would unite in a
determined effort to wipe out the
ants, they could be exterminated.

RABBI ABRAM SIMON
GIVES JEWISH VIEW

At the Good-Will’ Seminar held on
the campus the week-end before va-
cation, which was said to be “an op-
portunity for pulling up the blinds
that shed the causes of discrimina-
tion,” many points of importance
were questioned and discussed by
leaders of the Jews, Catholics, and
Protestants.

Suggestions for solution of the
question, “The Extent of Religious
Discrimination and What Can Be
Done About It” were: “that a pro-
gram of religious education be in-
augurated in our public  schools;”
“that every community should have
public talks given in the form of a
Jecture series by men from the trades
and professions wha are members of
the various religious faiths;” “that
American children be taught how the
children of other nations and faiths |
live so that the ‘foreigner feeling’ |
might be done away with,” and “that |
similar seminars be held throughout
the nation.” |

Gives Opinions
About Writing

“Liberal Education Of Value
To Future Journalists,”
Says Professor

“That a liberal education is of the
utmost value to students expecting tu
do newspaper and magazine work,” is
the belief expressed by Dr. L. E.
Theiss, writer and professor of jour-
nalism, who has been a contributor to
more thun 40 magazines, and is the
author of 19 books,

To understand the wants of the
modern reader, the present day writer
must have a broad background from
which to draw his material. Dr.
Theiss says that newspapers and
magazines are read by people of edn-
cation and culture whose tastes de-
mand reading of a high quality. “In
this respect,” he said, “we have
passed beyond the age of the mono-
syllable and of monosyllabic thought.
The more educated we become the
more complicated are our ideas and
eur speech.”

Dr. Theiss says it is true that
“style is the man.” In other worda,
2s a man is, so does he write. Edu-
cation, experience, self, all go into the
style of the work.

Culture Forms Character

“What is absorbed of culture and
knowledge becomes a part of one’s
character,’ he says. “In this man-
ner literature, art, and music become
a part of us. These factors are like-
ly to be passed on at any time
through thought expression in either
written or spoken form.

“The individual raised on the street
and bred in the ways of vice, thinks
of everything in a wrong, licentious
manner.® So it is natural that the
speech and writing of such an indi-
vidual is tainted with viciousness and
Neentiousness. On the other hand, if
the person is reared under cultural
educational influences, his

The | thoughts are on a higher level. The

Not Intelligence Tests
Dr. Learned emphasized the fact
that these tests were not intelli-
gence tests
ment, and that the purpose of the
testis was to show how much of the
reneral body of available knowledge
tudent had — acquired. He also
poipted out that the results indicated
that numerous students who did poor
work in college classes ranked very
high in netual necomplishment. — He
interpreted this fact to mean that
these students had powers of self
education; that they found elassrooin
work uninteresting and irksome and
sc put no effort into it. At the same
time, in some way and in some place,
they were acquiring very real edu-
cations along general lines. This
indicated, suid the speaker, that we
might pay more attention to stu-
dents of this type, who show anti-
tude for educating themselves.
Correlation Needed
Dr. Learned summed up his ob-
servations by saying that he believed
the Carnegie exnminations pointed
out one thing: that although Ameri-
can educators doubtlessare thorough
in their verious fields, und students
no doubt do good enough work in
these various lines, there is no proper
general method of correlating
courses, so that a sstudent carries
along: with him from course to course
what he has previonsly acquired, re-
lntes it to future work, and under-
stands its interrelation to other
topics. Instead, a student Studies a

That New Penitentiary

Bill Nye, a famous humorist of a past generation. went to
a fashionable Fifth Avenue Church one Sunday and, ignored
by somewhat supercilious ushers, found his way to an empty)
rear scat. He was just beginning to enjoy the service whe:
a super-dressed specimen of society swept into the far end
‘of the same pew. Gazing at him disdainfully through he
lorgnette, she passed him a note on which was writter: “I
pay a $1,000.00 a quarter for this pew.’ Nye, quickly sizing
up the shallow character of his new acquaintance, scribbled
on the other side of the sheet: “For value received, you pay
too much.”

Some very respectable people ‘variously related to the
town and the University are all excited about Lewisburg's
new Federal penitentiary. There is such a vast difference
between sinners in the making and those who have passed
‘the head line stage that it isn’t right for them to live in the
same vicinity. For the fair name of Lewisburg to connote
both education and reformation is unthinkable, even though
the new institution is the highest type of its kind in the world
and a noble experiment in reclaiming damaged souls.

The College Inn “spokesman” will never be found sitting
on a fence. We may be on thé wrong side of the fence, but,
tight or wrong, you'll know whcre'to find us. We can't sec
the colorless, neutral individual, staging a marathon Janus-
like existence. We are not afraid of that other fellow sitting
alongside us in the same pew, in fact, like the poor publican,
we regret that we offer him such poor company.

The College Inn has nothing to gain or lose by a Federal!
penitentiary. But we are proud of the high type of business
men found in Lewisburg. Our competitors are our friends.
There is no cut-throat competition. With little exception
the business men work together for a bigger and better Lew
ispurg. They are interested in each other’s success. That
is why cooperation aynong Lewisburg merchants has succeed-
ed in landing a large Federal project, a source of prosperit
for our working people and merchants that will flow contin
ously and copiously on. They're for it and we're for then
We extend our congratulations that in the face of strong com-
petition from over one hundred other communities that thev
succeeded so well. '

The College Inn will offend some of its student and fac-
ulty friends by its present stand on this controversy. We are
sorry. We need all the business we can get. But we are far
mere concerned about losing our soul than losing our busi-
ness. We believe some things are more important than busi-
ness and we've often-had our say. We must testify in trying
to save our soul we have saved both. For all these other
things have been added unto us in generous fashion. .

President Hoover and Sanford ——_- College Inn
welcomes you to Lewisburg.

So sensitive is this tube, that it can measure 0.000,000,000,000,000,¢

of an ampere, or, one-hundredth of a millionth of a billionth of an

Outstanding Teams

WASSERMAN IS GOALIE

Egel and Franzino Chosen
For Full-back Posts On
First Team

Choosing an All-Fraternity soccer
team resembles the task of picking
an All-American football team in the
problem of picking the best man from
a number of good candidates for a
position. i

Sigma Chi, Theta Upsilon Omega,

The

Alpha Chi Mu, and Tau Epsilon Delta
proved to be the outstanding teams
of the fraternal leagues. All four
elevens had good team work.

The difference in the play of ‘the
first and second team players was
very slight in some eases. Wasser-
man, as golie, and Norm Egel and
Sol Franzino at the fullback posts
seemed to be outstanding at their
positions.

Wasserman’s fine play as goalie
for the T. E. D. team was responsible
for much of his team’s success. Egel,
T. \U. O., fullback played well in
every game. His powerful kicking
and good defensive work gained him
a first string ranking. Franzino, the
other fullback, was the big factor in
the late season success of the Delta
Eta Chi team.

Tau Epsilon Delta placed three men
on the first team; Sigma Chi and T.
U. 0. each have two while Delta Eta
(Chi, Kappa Delta Rho, Kappa Sigma,
and Phi Kappa Psi divide the four re-
maining places.

“Doggie” Julian, ’23,
Resigns At Albright

Leaves Grid Coaching Post For
Possible Business Reasons

Alvin “Doggie” Julian, '23, head
coach of football at Albright College,
has resigned as grid mentor at the
Reading school. Julian gave no rea-
sons for his resignation.

The former Bucknel) star resigned
his post before the game with West-
ern Maryland last week, in which his
team tied the powerful Maryland
eleven.

Julian has ‘been head coach at Al-
bright since 1925. ‘His teams have
compiled a successful record of 34
victories, 17 defeats, and two ties in
that time. Under his guidance Al-
bright has built up quite a reputation
among smal] Eastern colleges.; Under
his tutelage, Albright has scored sev-
eral notable victories, that over

, Temple in ’28, and that over Davis

Elkins last fall, being especially
prominent, This year the. Lions tied
the great Western Maryland club,
which had been undefeated and untied
this fall in Eastern football.

“STEVE” WINDES WINS
SECOND PLACE IN RUN

Starting a great sprint a half mile
from the finish line, Arthur L. Ran-
da)l, '32, walked away with an easy
victory in Bucknell’s second annual
cross country run, which was staged
the Monday prior to the Thanksgiving
recess.

Randall will receive the silver lov-
ing cup donated by the department
of Physical] Education, which is em-
blematic of the Bucknell cross coun-
try championship.

Stephen L. Windes, '33, took second
honors, finishing 150 yards behind
Randall. Windes won out in the home
stretch from Henry Coates, '31, last
year’s winner. Bruce Jacobs, '34,
finished fourth ahead of fifteen other
entrants. ,

Starts Slowly

The contestants started off from
Tustin Gymnasium on their four-mile
grind which ended on Loomis Field.
Randall started slowly, taking a posi-
tion in the rear of the pack.

A slight drizzle began to fall at the
halfway mark, but it was not heavy
enough to bother the runners. Ran-
dall gradually overtook those ahead
and ran along in fifth place until a
mile from the finish, when he began
to lengthen his stride. By the time
the stadium was reached, he had built
up a 50 yard lead over Coates* who
was running second.

Randall began to sprint at the Sig-
ma Chi house, and was not pushed on
his way to the tape. Windes finished
strong to nose out Coates at the
finish Randall’s time for the dis-
tence was 22 minutes and 45 seconds.

GRID

Bucknell halfhack as he performed

with his usual brilliance. Ammerman
had hurt his back in one of the mid-
season games. Dad Hoskins, the
Bison trainer, had_seemingly ironed
out the kinks, and Ammerman played
at Pittsburgh in the W. and J. game,
only to aggravate his injury.

It looked as though Shan had play-
ed his last game, but several had not
given up hope; two of these were
Ammerman himself and Dad Hoskins.
Hoskins was the doctor and Ammer-
man the patient for a good many
hours -in the days preceding the
Fordham game. Hoskins was rather
dubious about the result, but Ammer-
man wasn’t and Fordham had to face
the slippery Snavely back.

Becomes Ground Gainer

Ammerman ended his ten years of
football by becoming one of the most
consistent ground gainers that Buck-
nell has had in several seasons. Shan
played football at Tyrone High School
and the New York Military Academy

before enrolling at Bucknell. He

was a pupil of Mal Musser as a fresh-
man. Ammy made the varsity squad
in his second year. Last year the
injury jinx was on his trail, and Am-
merman was unable to play the
greater part of the schedule.

Much of Bucknell’s grid success
this fall has been due to the fine ball
carrying of this 165 pound dynamo.
Ammerman’s specialty is picking up
yardage on off-tackle plays. He is
seldom stopped short of four or five
yards on his off-tackle slants.

Temple had more trouble in stop-
ping the Tyrone lad than they had
with any other Bison back. The Owls
were unable to stop his savage
thrusts, until a severe ankle injury
laid him low. Ammerman was de-
clared to be out for the season, but
the following’ Saturday he appeared
with a slight limp, but as good as
ever. at piercing an opponent . line.
At Scranton, Ammerman broke loose
for a 77 yard dash off-tackle on
Bucknell’s first offensive play.

You may not have heard the joke

Connie Mack
Pays Tribute
To “Big Six”

Pitcher’s Position On

All-Time Team

“HAD DIVINE POWER
FROM BEGINNING’

Bucknell’s greatest athlete, Christy
Mathewson, has once more been sig-
nally honored. Connie Mack, pilot of
the World Champion Athletics has
selected Big Six as his pitcher on his
all time All-American baseball team.

For sixteen years Matty was the
king of pitehers. He compiled the
greatest record ever made by any
pitcher. -

Connie Mack in selecting his team
has words of htghest praise for his
pitching selection. Mack is unstint-
ing in his praise of the man who
started his brilliant career on the
Bucknell campus. He writes of
Christy:

“T pick Christy Mathewson for my
pitcher because he showed that divine
power from the minute he entered the
majors in 1901. More than ten years
passed and he was still the mightiest
pitcher of the Giants and the beau
ideal of National League flingers.

Was a Winning Pitcher

“Matty was always a winning
pitcher and at his best when much
was at stake. As a matter of fact,
he was unbeatable in his prime in an
important game or series.

‘He shut the Athletics out three
times in the World’s Series of 1905,
a pitching feat that has never been
matched and may never again be
equalled in this classic.

“Cool and brainy, his control was
remarkable. Nobody ever waited him
out. His curve ball was unhittable.

“Matty had size, build, personality,
everything in his favor. There never
has been such a pitcher before or
since.”

At half time the Kingston team
was Jeading the Bison Yearlings by
a 6-0 count. A rejuvenated Bucknell
team came out of the dressing room

.in the second half to run up a 20

point lead. :

The game was well fought
throughout, with the frosh line per-
forming in great shape from end to
end. In the third quarter the em-
battled frosh held the Kingston out-

“fit on their four-yard line, for one of

the best defensive stands of the
game.

The entire backfield was clicking
in great shape throughout the second
half. Peters, Vehrey, Meyers, Priest,
and Heydrich were the most con-
sistent ground gainers.

On the line there was no out-
standing performer, but the work of
the entire forward wall left little to
be desired. Farina at center and
Dorman at guard were in every play.

End Of Grid Season

Navy Scores In the First And
Second Quarters; Bisons
Superior At End

The soccer team ended its season
on Wednesday, November 19, when
the Naval Academy team was met
at. Annapolis. The score was 2-1 in
favor of the Middies, but it was only
the margin of a free kick which sent
.the Bisons down to defeat.

The game was the best the local
team has played all season. The
passing and general team play were
much improved over earlier season
form.

Navy scored on a free kick in the
first quarter, and rang up its second
marker in the second quarter. From
then on, the game was with the
Bisons. Biando, outside left, scored
a pass to the left of the Middy goal.
It was a well placed shot and the
goal keeper never had a chance to
make a stop. The remainder of the
game wax very close, with euch

tedm trying desperately to score.
Bucknell missetl several cxcellent
chances to score in the last canto,
and the Middies maintained their
good record.

Bisons Complete Three Out Of
Eight Pass Attempts; Ram
Tries One Aerial

Justin Brumbaugh’s 44 yards gain
from scrimmage was the best record
of any Bison back against Fordham
in the Polo Grounds.

Bucknell’s flashy backs could not
penetrate the Ram line as they had
been accustomed to sift through|,
enemy lines in previous games. Ford-
ham was out to stop Clark Hinkle,
who raised havoc with their advance
fortifications last year. They did it
quite effectively, for the Jron Major,
Cavanaugh, had veritably built a line
of iron, which withstood the bullet-
like thrusts of the Bison ball carriers.

Bucknell completed three of eight
passes for a gain of 32 yards. Two
were intercepted. Fordham’s only
forward was intercepted by Hinkle. |

Fordham lost 35 yards in penalties |

the auspices of the Artist Course.
A performance for . children and

ternoon, At that: time, the Marion-
ettes will present “Rip Van Winkle.”
Budget tickets will admit students
to the evening performance only.

The Marionettes, direct from ten
seasons on Broadway, will present a
quaint and = novel entertainment.
Operated by more than four hundred
invisible strings, they dance, sing,
play the piano, smoke, play ball, ride
prancing steeds, and perform like
real people. Minature stage sets
with elaborate lighting and scenic
effects add much to the charm of
their performance.

A company of eight actors will ac-
be the introduction of a human actor
upon the stage with the puppets.
Miss Elise Dvorak, a member of the
troupe accompanying the show, will
step out on the stage to play the
scene in which Alice grows uncom-
fortably large.

A ompany of eight actors will ac-
company the Marionettes to manipu-
late their strings and to speak their
lines. The company, the first of the
Marionette shows to be given as a
traveling attraction, has toured from
coast to coast, playing in nearly _
of the leading American, colleges an:|

On the first day of the special doe
season “Don” reported to the woods
back of Buffalo mountain, where, 25
minutes after’ he alighted from the
machine which transported his party
to the scene of action, he brought
down a 125-pound doe. He was in
Lewisburg at ten minutes past eight
o'clock, that morning.

But that wasn’t all!

“Don’’ wasn’t satisfied and on the
morning of the first day of the buck
season, he brought down a 175-poun‘l
buck within 75 yards of the spot
where he shot his doe four days pre-
viuosly.

This time, ‘‘Don” was slightly late

Dr. Clarence R. Johnson Publishes
Article On Turkish Movement

Dr. Clarence R. Johnson, former
professor of sociology at Bucknell,
who left the campus in 1929 because
of fll health, published an article on
“The Turkish Nationalist Movement
in Its Immediate Background” in the
November-December issue of Journal
of Sociology and Social Research.

Dr. and Mrs. Johnson are now
living in the Adirendacks near
Bloomingdale, N. Y. Before coming
to Bucknell, Dr. Johnson was profes-
-aor of sociology at Robert College,
Constantinople.

In his article Dr. Johnson examines
the national crises of motern Tur-
key, concerning which he says:

connection with the fifty-first annual
|meeting of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers at New York
last week.

The productions of Mr. Garnyan
exhibited were: “Castle of Chillon”
and ‘Fog on the Great Lakes,” both
in water colors and “Buffclo Creek

water colors are Mr. Garman’s fav-
orite works, The first mentioned is
a reproduction. Inspiration for the
second came to Mr. Garman while he

oar boat emerging from the fog
bank. The Buffalo Creek seene was

the process of westward migration,
and to the economic, political, and

results upon national development.

Inez Robison, alto, Melicent Mel-
Tose, soprano, and Albert Weiden-
saul, bass, will be the soloists of the
annual presentation of Handel's
Christmas oratario, “The Mess{ah,”
the .seeond concert: of the season in,
the School of Music series, Sunday
afternoon in the Baptist Church.

Professor Paul G. Stolz will con-
duct the Lewisburg Hadrigal Choir,
the Collegium Musicum orchestra,
and the Baptist choir in the oratorio,
Miss Janet Mench, organist, and Miss
Ruth Hlavaty, pianist, will be aceom-
panists.

The tenor recitatives of the ora-
torio will probably be omitted in ab-
sence of a soloist. Otherwise, the
coniposition will be presented in its
entirety. The music for the Colleg-
jum Musicum orchestra is the Ger-
man Breitkopf and Haertels edition.

“The Messiah” is the best known
of all Handel’s work and is probably
the most popular composition of the
Baroque age though it js inferior to
Bach’s work and to much of the work
of Handel himself. Containing many
noble passages, it has, unfortunately,
become worn with over use.

Nathaniel “Nate” Glazier, ’82, was
elected captain of soeeer late yester-
day afternoon by a vote of the letter
men. Glazier has played right half-
back on the Bucknell varsity eleven,
since soccer was added to Bucknell’s
intercollegiate sport activities last
fall. Never a flashy player, Glazier
has become one of the most depend-
able of the Bison booters through his
Steadiness and fight.

While attending Bethlehem High
Schpol, Glazier played three years on
the’ schools fast varsity soccer ag-
gregation and in his senior year, he
| cantnined his team,

“The first of these occurred soon
after the occupation by the Allies of
Constantinople in the autumn of 1918
and the subsequent disillusionment
with regard to the moral~superiority
of the Allies. Next came the occu-
patien of the Turkish port of Smyrna,
May 16, 1919, by the Greeks, whom
to the Turks were the most despised
of the allied nations. The third was
the Treaty of Sevres whith virtually
meant the destruction of:\thé’ Otts-
man Empire.”

The humiliating injustices incurred
by these three crises, Professor John-
son says, are the cause of such phe-
|nomenal changes in Turkey.

in the Biology Annex, room 302. The
trials’ for upperclassmen have been
set for 4 o'clock, Tuesday afternoon.

Candidates may choose either one
of the following subjects for their

permitted to speak for six minutes
on any phage of either topic.

Ann Landis, '38, manager of the
women’s team, and Edward C. Strock,

arranging schedules for the coming
season. The tentative schedule for
the women’s team includes trips to

ALUMNI ARE MARRIED

Believes That Unifying Spirit
One of Greatest Values
Of College Chapel

At Bucknell, as at numerous other
American colleges, the matter of the
college chapel is one of interest to
students. That regular chapel exer-
cises have great value for students;
in ways other than religious is point-
ed out in a recent issue of the Yale
News, which devoted two columns to
reporting a discussion of the matter
by the Rev. Elmore McKee, chaplain
of Yale University.

Chaplain McKee, in the light of his
years of experience at Yale, says
that one of the great values of col-
lege chapel is its unifying effect upon
the student body. In his last two
services before the Christmus vaca-
tion he gave two addresses on this
general topic, the first, which is here
quoted, in part, being on the etttisiail|
“Yale’s Diversity and Religion as Its
Unifier.”

“We become riveted to the frag-
ments of a university before we be-
come conscious of underlying uni-
ties,” Mr. McKee said. “Students
find themselves separated from their
fellow-men through the fragmenting
effects of intellectual divisions sug-
gested by the course of study. Grow

interests which they stimulate, jie

“There are the fragments based

some universities even national or
acial separations occur in spite ¢
efforts to minimize them

“There are fragment
by the different pursuits a man en- |
wages in during the time when study
and club life and professional inter-
ests are not in the forefront.

“There is one great word which
tands for a great experienee which
binds us all together. It is the word
Seeker, and its derivative, Search.
We may be unaware of a common
goal to our quest, but we must recog-
nize n common root in a common
search,

“The Seeker finds «a Purpose be-
yond his Search. Will he become
Partner of the Search seeking him?
Can we not see what a splendid quest
is summoning us in each fragment,
and what zest it can bring?
there nothing which ean bind to-
gether our fragments into a whole?
Yes—the Search itself unites us.
We are all seekers, asking, ‘What is
my chemistry, my engineering, my
forestry, my medicine, all about?
What is my art and music and lan-
guage and literature and sociology
all about? What is my football and
friendship all about? These are all
leading us somewhere, to some Pur-
pose which unites us, the investiga-
tors and experiencers, with the world
of fact and substance and people be-
yond ourselves. As together we
seek, is there some common good
which we glimpse, even from our
separate vantage points?’

"Thus our host of seekers, each
treading his lonely mountain trail
marked, ‘a study in spruce seed’ or
‘the gasoline engine’ or ‘the amoeba’
or ‘Chaucer’ or ‘unemployment’ or
amntg’abnge ico'tehel jea‘sonhreo'nif
‘cancer’ or ‘Beethoven’ or ‘the Gothic
arch’ or ‘rowing’ or ‘Alpha
Phi,’ finds his footpath leading hiin
and other dissectionists to a country
voadway marked ‘Forestry’ or ‘Engi-
neering’ or ‘Biology’ or ‘Literature’
or Sociology’ or ‘Medicine’ or ‘Music’
or ‘Art’? or ‘Athletics’ or ‘Friendshij’
und then, his sense ‘of « common
search for a common goal with a
common humanity, mounting like an
incoming title, he finds himself snd
his increasingly numerous and united
brothers being swept into one of
three great highways labeled, ‘The
Quest for Truth, “The Quest for
Goodness,’ ‘The Quest for Beauty.’

Highways Have Common Rootage

“Bach of these great highways hos
” common rootage back in a com-
mon mother earth from which each
mountain trail and valley foot-path
emerged. Each has its common
surging life and each is kinship with
life that surges upon the other high-
ways. What means our common
source, our common march, the com-
mon tide that carries us along, our
common quest? Long before this, In

It was given.

“Finally there dawns for each the
greatest of all moments in human
experience when man turns from his
test-tube, or his crusade, or his sun-
set, and says or shouts—GOD. No
other word expresses his awe and
wonder, his humility, his reverence,
his creaturechood, his sense of son-
ship, of brotherhood with all seekers,
his sense of mystery, as well as—
GOD.

“God is the GREAT UNKNOWN.
Who can compass His paths? But
God is also well-known. We do not
know fully what or who He ts. But
we do know that He is. From moun-
tain trail to main highway our course
has been mounting until in one
mighty thoroughfare we now unite
to proclaim our quest and our find-
ing—to proclaim and affirm God.

Broad Highway is Worship

“That final broad highway is wor-
ship. The worshipping body aims to
include the whole of Good-seeking
and God-conscious humanity. The
Church is humanity making corpor-
ately the great affirmation—GOD.

“Worship expresses the questing
spirit. Worship integrates. Wor:

hip unites. Worship pools our sep-
arate findings. Worship enlarges
our vision of God. Worship is our
power-house. Worship makes up
brothers under God. Worship gives
us the vision of harmony. Worship

deeper levels of our academic «quest
lead us. We do not want a building
just for the sake of having a build-
ing, but because it would be the logi-
eal outcome and the crowning glory
of the university’s deepest purposes,
The building would embody in its
architecture the academic spirit, the
Yale spirit and the Yale heritage, the
New England and the American
spirit, and the still wider sweep of
the religious spirit and the Christian
spirit through history. It would truly
be a house of prayer for all people.”

EDUCATION CAUSES
WOMEN 10 ENTER
SOCIAL SERVICE

College Graduates Concentrate
In Lower Paid Occupations ;
Sacrifice Opportunities
SURVEY FINDS AVERAGE
ANNUAL INCOME IS $1,662

The more education an advanced
American woman gets, the more she

tends to devote her life to social ser-
vice instead of making money, is the
startling revelation made by the
bureau of Business Research of the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor
in a recent survey of 14,073 business
and professional women.

Three-fourths of those answering
the questions put to them by the
bureau were employed in commer-
cia}, educational, and manufacturing
organizations. The annual income of
the women was found to be $1,662,
ated! Naily 6.7 percent carncg $3,000 or
more. .

College Women Earn More

“Women who have been graduated
from a college or university,” says
the report, “are earning more inevery
kind of work than women with less
education.

“They tend, however, to concen-
trate in lower paid fields, such as
teaching and clerical work. They do
not tend to select occupations where
chances of high financial rewards are
best.

“Seventy percent of these college
women are in the employ of educa-
tional, social or welfare organizations.
Why? Is it because college women
ean afford to overlook questions of
earnings? Are the inherent satisfac-
tions of the work itself more import-
ant to them than financial returns?
May it be that teaching and welfare
work seem to college women more
socially approved ways of earning a
livelihood? Or is she unaware of
the opportunities in these newer fields
of work? Perhaps the true answer
is a composite one.”

Milton had donated to conduct the
boys to Bucknell, to Memorial Sta-
dium, Which completed the tour of

Dear Santa—

We, having been most generously
taken care of during the past year
by our sugar daddy, (pronounced
“professor” by our loyal brothers),
even so far as to having the exterior
of our house renovated, believe that
in this period of depression your
gifts should go to the poor and needy,
not those who have already been
amply rewarded. So therefore, we
will be satisfied with a ecard,

it is.

Santa—

The ‘boys in our chapter are unit-
ing in asking you that you bring vic-
tory to one of dur members. It
seems that a certain publication on
Bucknell’s campus is running a con-

of our house to win it.

If it is within your power, please
see that this takes place.

Dean Clark, of Lewisburg; a half
brother, Harry N. Graham; « half
sister, Mrs. Margaret Graham Tole;
and a step-sister, Mrs. Emma Smith,
all of Montclair, N. J.

Funeral services were held Satur-
day at 4 o'clock, at her late resi-
dence. The Rev. Raymond W. West,
pastor of the Baptist Chureh, and
President Emory Hunt conducted the
services. The body was taken to
Troy for burial. Interment was
made in the Oxford cemetery from

As Dramatic Clubs Present

For Second Dramatic

SMITH AIDS DIRECTION

By Nenneth A. Haynes, '31

Campus drama, as sponsored by
Cap and Dagger and Frill and Frown,
experienced another decided spurt en
reute to bigger dramatic ventures
Thursday night, when a cast of
eleven, all aspiring for acting posi-
tions in one of the two organizations,
presented “Duley” under the direc-
tion of Philip Neisser,’31,in such an
impressive and sprightly way that it
is still being talked about.

Bessie Snyder’s colorful portrayal
of the effervescent Duley has been
widely discussed. When George
Kauffman and Mare Connelly con-
ceived their satirie comedy, they
placed the primary responsibility
upon the title character. Miss Sny-
der realized that fact. Except for
an over-emphasized line or two, her
interpretation of the role was charm-
ingly realistic and aglow with per-
sonality. She is entitled to know
that a more eonvincing Duley could
not have been found, :

Characters Range Widely

The potpourri of characterizations
provided by the Kauffman-Connelly
wit ranged from the lovable, innno-
cently-interfering Dulcy, who eharit-
ably hired a butler with a prison
record (Robert Walsh, '84, who gave
an admirable exhibition of facial con-

Middleton, ’31, was capable of in-

So sensitive is this tube, that it can measure 0.000,000,000,000,000,01

'Philadelphia Organist Shows
Great Understanding Of
Baroque Composer

| ALBERT WEIDENSAUL, ’28
| SINGS RECITATIVE WELL

The masterful work of Paul S.
Robinson, Philadelphia organist, and
the colorful singing of Albert Weiden-
saul, '28, stood out in the unusual
music of the all-Bach program, first
ot the School of Music concert
series, given Monday evening in the
Baptist Church.

The Curtis Institute organist ex-
hibited a thorough understanding of
the Baroque composer, presenting an
exceptional interpretation of the fa-
miliar “Toceata and Fugue in D
minor” and of “Prelude in C major.”

Ills conception of two movements,
Allegro Moderato and Adagio, of
“Trio Sonata No. 1,” originally writ-
ten for three violins, showed a
thorough appreciation of polyphony.
Limited by the inadequacy of his in-
strument, Robinson, nevertheless,
| achieved notable heights in organ
| music.
| Gives Fine Solo

Albert Weidensaul’s singing of the
recitative, “Consider then, Child of
| God,” was a very fine piece of solo
work. His entire mastery over a
voice of unusually fine quality was
shown to excellent advantage.

Excellent, tov, was the singing of
Miss Melicent Melrose, soprano, who
fave vn aria and an extremely difti-
cult recitative, while Miss Inez Robi-
son was the outstanding member of
the sextet.

The work of the chorus was weuk-
est in the eariy measures of the
fugue that opened the cantata, “Ein
Feste Burg,” reaching glorious cti-
maxes in the three preliminary
chorales and in the closing chorale
of the cantata. The work of the
Collegium Musicunt orchestra and of
the accompanists, Miss Janet Mench,
organ, and Miss Ruth Hlavaty, eem-
kalo, was of the highest quality, at-
taining an almost ethereal exquisite-
ness in the chorales

Bucknell’s record of six victories
ard three defeats was made against
scme of the strongest teams in the
East. Fordham was perhaps the
strongest grid outfit in the East this
year, Certainly Major Frank Cava-

Meyer Kaplan of Penn State is given

Fordham’s Tackle Good

Fordham’s fine tackler, Frank

Foley and Mike Miskinis, proved to
be as fine a pair of tackles as any
team could boast of in the country.
Foley, weighing 210 pounds, was one
of the best of this year’s tackles.
Miskinis, on the other side of the
line was almost as effective as his
brilliant colleague. Edwards, Vil-
hard-fought game to the Washington|.lanova tackle, was one of the bul-

Demas of W. and J. played a great

Bucknell. 'His fine work in this game
entitles him to prime consideration.
Bannak, of Temple, and Tracey of
Fordham were other guards who
played good football all season.
Tracey's fine work on the stalwart
Fordham line, entitles Mim to much

Chenoweth led the Bisons in scor-
ing last winter, rolling up 159 points
in 18 games. Chenoweth at 148
pounds is one of the fastest forwards
Bucknell has had in a long while.
The Harrisburg lad has the knack of
dropping them in from all angles and
all positions. His passing and cut-
ting ability fit in well with the type
of basketball that Bucknel] has to
play.

Don. Mills, forward on the fresh-
man five, two years ago, will prob-
ably be at the other forward post.
These two boys work together like a
bootlegger and politician, so oppos-

(ay. Mal has good reasons for be-
ing elated about his yearling grid-

his own story about Bucknell’s un-
defeated freshman grid squad.

“The following weights prove that
football is a body building — sport.
Most of the boys gained from 3 to
15 pounds in three months. This
gain was not fat, but natural mus-
cular increase, evenly distributed
over the body, due to constant ac-
tivity. This demonstrates clearly
the truth of the old physical law that
use builds up and = disuse breaks
down,” remarked the genial mentor
as he began to warm up to his sub-
ject.

other

Bucknell’s second year of intet-
collegiate soccer was eminently more
successful than the first. While the
percentage average of the team
did not look so good, the improve-
ment over last year was remarkable.

Last year two games were played,
and both were lost. This season
one of the teams that beat Bucknell
last year was defeated, and the other
was tied. In the other three games,
the Bisons were pitted against much
better coached teams. The soccer
team here had no regular coach, for
while Mr. Plant gave all the time
he could to the team, he could 2ot
give it all of his attention.

And Have Plenty Of Fun

With football taking a back seat to
the indoor sports, boxing has swung
into the early-season grind.

Last year’s varsity men and the
new recruits are working out daily
in the gym under the tutelage of
“Lou” Marchesano, this year’s cap-
tain. With the new material on
hand and a}l of Jast year’s veterans,
except Frank~ Lepore, hard at work,
the outlook for « successful season
in the ring is exceedingly bright.

The interest in boxing is increasing
steadily as is evidenced by the turn-
out for the team. Some of the new
mien have had some experience while
others are beginners. Many of them
show signs of developing into good
material for next year, if not for the
present campaign,

boys first reported for
practice, it was noticed at once that
they realized they were no longer
the ‘big shots’ they had been in high
achool or prep schoo], They were
realy and exceedingly willing to take
instruction by individual practice
without asking too many questions
or without attempting to tell, show
or follow their own methods. ‘This
spirit of willingness to cooperate
with cach other and to work for the
good of the whole and to work will-
ingly with each other was a very
unusual spirit to find in the — first
week of frosh football practice. Re-
member these boys came from dif-
ferent schools where different sys-
tems of football were taught.

Had Adaptability

“It usually takes a freshman from
four to six weeks to realize the sig-
nificance of the complete change
from his high school and prep school
environment to his college frosh foot-
hall environment. But these boys
had that fine characteristic of quick
adaptability, and this trait revealed
itself many times in games and
helped to bring them victory.

“In the first game of the season,
that with the Stroudsburg State
Teachers’ College freshmen, our
team romped through to a 36 to 6
victory. The opponents were willing
‘but light. We met our first real
test in the Cook Academy game. It
was a very interesting and exciting
game, decided by one touchdown,

W. Maryland Win Significant

“In the third game, the Bucknell ,

frosh made history, for it was the firs
time that our yearlings had ever de-
feated Bellefonte Academy. The
score was 7 to 6.

“Against the Western Maryland
frosh, the boys “clicked” very nicely
to the tune of a 48 to 0 victory. This
triumph became all the more signifi-
cant, when the Western Maryland
team defeated the Navy Plebes the
following week.

“Armistice Day foun! the boys
Waying in Williamsport against the
strong Dickinson Seminary eleven
which they defeated 26 to 6.

“Our following game was one of
the hardest of the season, since it
wis played against an undefeated
team, which had bowled over prep
schoo! and college freshman elevens.
Keystone Academy claimed the prep
school championship of the — stite.
We were trailing in the last quarter,
‘but the old fight and the will to win
came to the front and we defeated
Keystone 13 to 7.

“In the final game of the svason
an inspired Wyoming Seminary team
led us 6 to 0 at half time, but in the
final half the spirit that was preval-
ent in the team all season came to
the surface and Wyoming Seminary
was beaten 26 to 6, bringing to a
close Bucknell’s first undefeated
frosh grid season.”

aeason. Not a few came from rival

uated, .Bienus, another man making
a bid for the weight, is hard at work
for the trials which will decide the
entrant in this class.

“Lou” Russu, a hard hitting soph-
omore, is a candidate for the middle-
weight ‘berth. (Last season Russo
was a reserve in this weight. He
fought a very nice fight at George-
town last year, coming through with
a win in a tough setto.

“Lou” Mutzel, last year’s captain
and a mainstay on the Bison team
for the past three years, will be ad-
vanced to the heavyweight division
this season. Mutzel has gained
weight and is now a natural heavy.
The place from which he steps up
will be filled, in all probability by
“Norm” Egel who fought in the un-
limited class here-to-fore. Hgel has
been showing great improvement over
his fine work of last winter, and
should account for his share of the
team points when he gets in action.

The lack of space is somewhat of
na handieap to efficient training, but
the boys ure making the most of
their opportunities to get in shape us
quickly as possible.

With the heavy sehedule which is
being arrange! for this year there
will be a need for good men in all
th classes as well as other men to
use in case of injury or other handi-
cups.

Vry and “Dutch” Borella, two vet-

Three Kinds Of Products
Advertising Can Sell

First, the product that offers some new and better way of
meeting human wants. For such a product advertising offers
the cheapest, quick-means of finding those people who will

appreciate the advantages the new product offers.

Second, the product with hidden values that escape the
consumer's untrained eye. For such a product advertising

can educate a discriminating purchaser.

Third, the product—which in lucid moments—its owner
will admit no better than others of its kind. For such a pro-
duct advertising can create a personality that will make it
stand out from competing products like the one lighted house

in a row of dark ones.

Which kind of product is yours.

STUDENT-FACULTY
RELATIONS GROUP
PICKS DELEGATES

Four Students, Two Professors
To Represent Bucknell At
Detroit Conference

Students Make Survey

Bucknell University will be repre-
sented at the national student-facul-
ty conference to be held at the Hotel
Book-Cadillac in Detroit, December
27 to 31, by J. Hillis Miller, dean of
freshmen, and Prof. Charles M.
Bond, head of the department of re-
ligton, together with a group of four
students selected by the committec
of stvdents and faculty members who
are now making an expensive survey
of student-faculty relations at Buck-
neil,

George Abernethy, David J. Evans,
and Charles Godcharles, all of '32,
and Trennie EK. Eisley, '31, will com-
plete the Bucknell delegation. Ro-
berta Slifer, and William Genne,
both '31, have been named as alter-
nates.

The purpose of the conference is
to provide an opportunity for consul-
tation and sharing of experience con-
cerning the place of religion and the
agencies of religion in college and
university life. A committee of
prominent educators from the out-
standing universities in this country
have been working for more than a
year in preparing the program for
the conference.

To Hold Sectional Meetings

Sectional meetings, centered in
certain definite areas of interest, will
meet each day. Seven commissions
dealing with vital campus problems
and headed by well-known university
deans and presidents have spent
months in gathering niaterial and
will guide the discussions in the daily
sectional meetings. Dean R. H.
Rivenburg is a member of the com-
mission on administrative policy, but
he will be unable to attend the con-
ference.

Trudnak nak Will Pla Play~*
Baseball In Cuba

B. U. JUNIOR CHOSEN
. FOR ALL-STAR NINE

“Big Steve’ Trudnak, Bucknell’s
wel]-known sophomore pitching sen-
sation of Jast’season, left yesterday
morning for New York City, where
he will join Les Gage’s College
Humor All-Star baseball nine com-
posed of outstanding diamond play-
ers selected from eleven American
colleges and universities.

The All-Star team sails on the
Steamship Republic, Saturday morn-
ing, for Havana, Cuba, where it
will meet a nine composed of Cuban
college men in two exhibition games
to be played on December 31 and
January 1.

The games were urranged to foster
more friendly relations between col-
leges in the United States nnd Cuba,
and to give impetus to an American
sport that was recently introduced
in Cuba,

The selection of Trudnak fs a sig-
nal tribute to the sterling pitching
ability of the big Shickshinny lad
who carried the brunt of the Buck-
nell pitching worries last spring in
his first season on the varsity. His
work as the shining light in an
otherwise dull season.

Other colleges to he represented on
the team are Holy Cross,'Penn State,
Notre Dame, Harvard, New York
University, Georgetown and Ford-
ham.

Dept. Of Religion Adds

raphy, private and public correspond-
ence, diaries, annals, and philosophi-
cnl writings in this course. This

WJBU Asked To Help
Employ Unemployed

The general counsel for the radio
commission suggests that WJBU,
with all the other stations in the
United States help in finding jobs for |
the unemployed. |

There are approximately 600 sta-
tiens throughout the United States
which serve a potential audience rep-
resenting almost the entire popula-
tion. Every state and community is
seryed by one or more radio stations,
and nearly every citizen is in reach
of a radio set. It is proposed that |
the stations ask their audiences to
Tet them know where a man can find
a job.

WOODEN PUPPETS
CHARM AUDIENCE
BY PERFORMANCE

Sarg’s Marionettes Are Cleverly |
Handled by Artist’s From |
Behind the Scenes

Dolls Arouse Interest

Eight hundred persons flocked into
the Lewisburg High School auditor-
jum last evening, and reached back
into their childhood memories to
thrill and to exalt before the master-
ful presentation of Lewis Carroll’s
“Alice in Wonderland” by the inter-
nationally-famed Tony Sarg Marion-
ettes.

Puppets may come and puppets
may go, but the laughing, sobbing,
prancing marionettes of Tony Sarg
will go on for a long, long time.
The skill with which the artists back
stage handled thelr proteges was
nothing short of marvelous, and time
and again, the controlled antics of
the whimsigal characters in the piece
brought salvo after salvo: of ap-
plause,

The interest which the a
high dolla aroused in the audience
was 90 great, ‘that at the end of the
performance, approximately one-third
of the attendance attempted to
force its way back of the scenes in

an ai to ylew the mysterious
we puppets were. made |:
to gor | their actions.

Ventriloquists Adept

Aside from the adept physical per-
formance of the puppets, the ven-
triloquistie art of the handlers back
stage left nothing to be _ “desired.
Elsie Devorak, whe took ‘the. »part of
Alice “grown-up,” and who also: vo-
calized “little Alice,” managed her
part splendidly. The well-inflected
tone of voice, the little question in
every sentence she -uttered, .alded
Miss Devorak in bringing everything
into complete harmony with the tone
of curiosity that permeates the play.

Probably the most realistic of the
storybook characters was ‘the Queen,
who was put through her paces with
a skill so adept, that there was never
any doubt as to what the Queen ac-
tually was after she first appeared
on the stage.. In modern parlance,
she was just a frumpy old cat, whose
nerves were always being set ‘on
edge.

The Dormouse and the Mock Turtle
aroused the humour and the sym-
pathy of the audience. Everyone
chortled in high glee as the little
brown mose continually awakened
from his fast sleep to badger words
with the Mad Hatter, another char-
acter that was excellently done. The
“Soup” song of the Mock “Furtle was
probably the most effective of the
songs worked in during the perform-
ance,

The most complicated of the 27
main puppets was the White Knight,

who abroad his horse Pegasus, had a)

comfortable time rescuing pretty
maidens in distress. Was there any-
thing prophetic in his close facial re-
semblance to Gifford Pinchot?

Dramatic Artist To |
{Entertain FrenchClub

Monique Lussan Mercat, Freneh
dramatic artist and soprano, will en-
tertain the French Club at its month-

ly meeting Wednesday evening, Jan-.

vary 6, in the playroom’ ‘of the new
dormitory at 8:00 o'clock.

Mademoiselle Mercat will recite
Alfred de Musset’s “La’ Chanson’ de
Fortunto,” “Rideau de ma _ Voisine”
and “Mim{ Pinson;” Paul Geraldy’s
“L’Abat-jour,” “Piano” ‘and ‘“Nerfs;”
and “Les Elfes” by Leconte de Lisle.
Her vocal offerings will include old
French songs which she will an-
nounce.

In recognition of her unusual abil-
ity as a dramatic soprano I'Alliance
Francaise has honored her for her
capability in musical work. She has
frequently appeared in the Comedie
Francaise.

BUCKNELL MEETS

BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY

LEWISBURG, PA., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1930.

SCOTCHMEN IN

CLOSE DEBATE |

SS }
Argue Question That Principles |
Of Nationalism Afford Basis
Of Social Organization

Small Audience Attends

One Bucknellian and one Scotch- |
man debated against another Buck-
nellian and another Scotchman Mon-
day night in a no-decision debate in
Commencement Hall on the question:
“Resolved, that the principles of na-
tionalism afford the ideal basis for
the organization of world society.”
Although the debate was one of the
finest international meets in which |
Bucknell has participated, only tage
ty-five persons were in attendance.

The affirmative side of the ques-
tion was upheld by Charles Bidel-
spacher, '33, of Bucknell, and John
M. MacCormack, of Glasgow Uni- |
versity. Bertram Cohen, °82, of
Bucknell and Norman ‘Alexander |
Bruce Wilson, of St. Andrews Uni-
versity furnished the opposition. In
the absence of President Emory W.
Hunt, Edward C. Strock, °32, man-
ager of the debating team, acted as
chairman. Members of the honorary
sophomore fraternity, the Friars, act-
ed as ushers.

Cohen Consistent

Cohen, the more experienced of the
Bucknell delegates, was consistent in
his attack. Both Wilson and Mae-
Cormaek were characterized by an
unostentatious polish, bred of long
experience. Norman Wilson, of St.
Andrews University, appeared in his
national garb of kilts, supplemented
by a formal coat and jacket. Wil-
son’s kilts represent the famous
Bruce clan of which he is a meniber.
The other debaters were dressed jn
the customary formal garb. ,

In establishing their case, the
members of the affirmative group
pointed out that when nations
tried to expand to a world state,
have caused terrific wars and
usually met with disaster. They in-
dicated that the. principles of na-

Teaching Methods Cause

Women. are superior to .men in the
scholastic. field; that is, in the class
of 1934, if one is willing to accept the
midsemester grades at their face
value.

Dean Miller read the list of grades
in freshman chapel Friday. The dif-
ference in the methods of teaching
in preparatory schools and colleges
was said by the Dean to be the great-
est eause of so many poor grades.

The statistics follow:

this level.

coneerning Miss Page:

In a dancing career whieh has
taken her from the Colon Opera in
Buenos Aires to the Music Box Revue
and from the Metropolitan to the
Imperial Theatre in Tokio, Ruth
Page has made a reputation as one
of the few Americans to achieve
success in operatic ballet, She ts at
the moment in Chicago, as the pre-
miere danseuse of the Ravina ecom-
pany which, each year under the
aegis of Louis Eckstein, publisher
and philanthropist, offers a full oper-
atic season out-of-doors. It was in
Chicago that Miss Page first became
known for her performance in John
Alden Carpenter's The. Birthday of
the Infanta and for the last four sea-
sons she has returned there each
summer. After two years as solo
dancer at the Metropolitan she went
last fall to Japan, where she appear-
ed in the special programs to cele-
brate the coronation of the Emperor,
and danced her way through Java.
Siam, and India before returning to
America for the current season.

about the altar showed the high re-
gard in which Dr. Heim was held by
his’ students and associates.

Dr. Raymond W. West, pastor of
the Baptist chureh and a friend of
Dr. Helm for many .years, spoke of
the steadfastness and faithfulness of
his friendship. ‘He was a comfort-
able friend to whom and for whom
it was not necessary to make apol-
ogy.. He had a real-faith in a real
God. We pay tribute te a man who
entered into those richest things of
life-friendship between .man'and- man
and friendship between man = and
God.”

President Hunt characterized Dr.
Heim as a man gifted with deep in-
sight and keen analysis. “He was
bigger than any subject with which
he was for the moment associated.”
said President Hunt.

“He Was a Friend"

“The degree of Doetor of Fellow:
ship has been conferred upon him by
the common consent of his associates
in every department of life. He was
a loyal, quiet, true, constant, and
consistent friend.”

Members of the Baptist choir sang
two hymns, “The Sands of Time,
and “Abide With Me.” The pall-
bearers were President Hunt, Deat
R. H. Rivenburg, and B. W. Griffith

time was acute. The Soviets influ-

many, and under the direction of
Bela Kun had already entered Hun-

further spread of these doctrines by
drastic measures, hoping to destroy
the Soviets in Hungary.

When called in by President Wil-
son that he might hear this proposal
made by Foch, General Bliss gave
his opinion in foreeful fashion. He
maintained that it was impossible to
supress a revolution that had _ spiri-
tual force by the strength of arms,
that the world was to counteract the
influence of Bolshevism, the — only
method that it could use was educa-
tion.

The advice of Gencral Bliss
followed, and instead of an army of

“GAIN BY GIVING”

“You're going home,” said Presi-

to the freshman chapel Tuesday
morning, “There you will have the
opportunity to show that education
is a really good thing for a human
life. If it seems nothing but froth
in you who advertise it,” or if you
vive a know-all impapesion, you
will be hurting its réputdtion. Ha
deeper, more genuine and earnest

and in what you say or do, it will be
the finest commendation you can
make.

“When you go home,

family. Be careful of your attitude
towards home, and homefolks, and
home ideals, all of those homely
qualities, which, after all, are the
(best and richest things in life.

“Try to realize that the greatest
satisfaction is gained in giving,
rather than in getting. Notice your
high school friends. Encourage them
to make something of themselves.
See to it that they seck the oppor-
tunity to climb to the highest point
in personal preparation for life. It
will be a good result of the Christ-
mas spirit, if you can give such im-
petus to some spirit.”

President Hunt concluded with the
words, “Merry Christmas and a
Happy New Year to you all with the
recollection that Christmas means
not getting, but rather the reverse,
to see what we can give of comfort
and inspiration to those at home.”

THE SENIOR TRIBUNAL

Tf the Senior Tribunal has such
difficult time thinking up excuses to
paddle freshmen, it had better find
another field in which to vent its
energy. Last Monday when the
Tribunal met, charges were lodged
against two or three,frosh, but be:
fore the session was over, several
moreshad been roped in and punish-
ed for misdemeanors’ that were
thought up after great effort on the
part of Tribunal members. It is
time the preetice of paddling fresh-
men ‘just to throw fear ‘jtite others
was stopped.
. It is commonly understood that the
Tribunal is a disciplinary body, cre-
ated to deal with matters brought to
its attention in a prescribed manner.
It is a court to decide guilt and to

mete out suitable punishment, but it!

fair as those practiced by unprin-
cipled policemen in giving a prisoner
the third degree. There is little
order in the court when the Tribunal
meets.

The Bucknellian is willing and
ready to ‘back up these generaliza-
tions with specific instances, but it
hesitates to do so at this time be-
cause of bringing personalities into
the discussion.

Furthermore, the Bueknellian  be-
lieves the Tribunal has powers to
perform functions that ‘eannot be
relegated to any other body. The
Tribunal is a necessary cog in the
present disciplinary system at Buck-
nell, but it should be eareful not to
overstep the bounds of its authority,
as it has been doing in the past with
great regularity. Trumping up
charges against freshmen just for
the sake of something to do is not a
part of its duty,

Tf a freshman has not been proper- |
ly reported by a sophomore or an!
| Upperclassman, it is not the business
}of the Tribunal to trouble itself with
|him. If no report has been made, it
|shows how disinterested the student
{body is—and that lack of interest
doesn’t disturb us in the least. The |}
less said about rules and paddling
and all that, twaddle the better. |

What Dr. Howard Omwake,
dean of Franklin and Marshall
college, said last week concern-
ing the, threatened expose ,of- F. -
and M. college life by a thirty-
year-old divorcee is in line with
what many of us have been
thinking. He said, “Let her tell
all she knows. We want to learn
more about such conditions if
she is telling the truth.” In fact,
the college world is waiting and
indeed hoping for more than a
sunrise. We would be delighted
if the young lady could think up
something the movies haven't.

Sinclair Lewis, who is now in
Stockholm, in formally accepting
the 1930 Nobel Prize for Litera-
ture made an interesting speech
to his Swedish audtence. “We
are coming out of the stufliness
of safe and sane and ineredibly
dull provincialism There are
the young Americans who are

doing such passionately authen-

tic work.” Who would have
thought it! From now on we
are going in for a little sleuthing
on the campus to find a young
American doing passionately au-
thentic work and untouched by
provincialism. Probably we'll
end up with the Boy Scouts.

A German audience broke up 4
revue in Nuremberg — recently
because, in attempting to show
the gala costumes of the various
nations, the German Gretchen
appeared in rags to illustrate the
Fatherland's financial plight.
From what we hear on all sides,
if we happen, during vacation, to
meet up with the Goddess in New
York harbor, we expect to find
that she has dropped her torch
and is frantically clutching the
remnants of her robe about her.

TRADITION IN DEPARTMENT STORE MERCHANDISING.
CUSTOMERS KNOW THERE WILL BE SUCH A SALE, AND
THEY PLAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. THEY MAKE LISTS

THEY OTHERWISE WOULD, AND THE MERCHANT SELLS

IS SO LARGE THAT HE NETS A WORTH WHILE RETURN. BOTH
THE MERCHAN AND THE CUSTOMER ARE WELL SATISFIED.

LIBERTY

sessenveree:

Everett Dean Martin .
W.-W. Norton & Co.
Reviewed by George Abernethy, °32
Liberty is a well-written book made
interesting by the manner in which
historical and - philosophical ma-
terial is used. It is especially
timely in this day when many
people are quite unconcerned about
liberty and freedom. Mr. Martin
discusses the Grecian Ideal, the
contributions of Christianity and
the Renaissance, and the attitudes
of Rousseau, Voltaire and other

definers of liberty.

Mr. Martin has rendered a dis-
tinct service in his lucid and eare-
ful interpretation of the history of
liberty as it has manifested itself
in the thought movements that be-
gan in ancient Athens and culimin-
ated in the French Revolution. In
it two important concepts are
found. The first appears in the
guise of individual right against
established authority; the second
regards liberty as a state of hap-

» piness—a general good.

The second view the author at-
tucks particularly as it is revealed
in the teaching of Rousseau. It
is this type of thought which in a
large measure explains the confu
sion of American liberals in their
discussions of liberty. Mr. Mar-
tin's theory is that liberty is not

universal, but a relat state

Mr. Martin is nothing n than

It aunoys him considerably. Onc
who takes the functional and rela
tive approach ought to ca voi
through to the individual ba f
group behavior

The most serious fault of the
hook is that it fails to be realistic
enough in its discussion of present
day liberties. The «author ha:
little to contribute to a new von-
ception. His plea for “faith in the
inner spirit’ may be good stuff for
neademi¢ and for a certain type of
intellectual, but it will not suffice
for moderns who live in a complex
machine civilization where many of
the older traditions have brolen
down.

IN “MESSIAH”

Handel's Work Characterized by
Profound Religious Spirit
And Massiveness
The presentation of Handel's
Christmas oratorio, “The Messiah”
in the Baptist church, Sunday after-
noon, was thé second effort of the
year in the School of Music Concert
Series to present the. finest in music

to Bucknellians.

Professor Paul G. Stolz conducted
the Lewisburg Madrigal Choir ac-
‘companied by Janet Mench, organist,
and Ruth Hlavaty, pianist, in the
concert. Melicent Melrose, soprano,
Inez Robison, alto, Charles Winters,
tenor, and Albert Weidensaul, bass,
sang the solos of the oratorio. ° ;

The oratorio is at the same time
one of the finest works of the eigh-
teenth century and one of the most
popular pieces of church music in
the twentieth century. A typical
composition of the Baroque, “The
Messiah,”’ is characterized by a pro-
found religious spirit and by a mas-
siveness that demands repeated hear-
ings that it may be understood.

Following the recent all-Bach of-
fering of the School of Music, it is
but one of many indications of the
growing desire of the American au-
dience for great compositions rather
than outstanding virtuosos.

A RETRACTION

With humiliation and regret and our decp apology for
such a subject at the Christmas Season of the year, the College
Inn is compelled to renounce its long held thought on the
good sportsmanship of Bucknell students. We have contin-
ously preached from the house top that Lewisburg is safe for
democracy and from Bucknell students, that no matter what
cceasion called forth an exuberant spirit in our student body
they would conduct themselves like gentlemen. If perhaps
some little damage was done they would not quibble ever
though some of the junk was billed as antiques. When a
dance hall proprietor or a movie magnate forbid an innocent
parade from injecting some much needed pep in their place of
business we thought they were all wet in “kicking against th
pricks.” ;

The Coflege Inn has learned long ago that college stu-
dents have not put away all childish things. We assumec
that although they were kiddish at times, never-the-less thev
were fine young people and only blowing off a little stcam
If they wanted to wrestle or rough-house a little, it was OK
with us. We have had slight regret for the liberties granted
and have always assumed that any serious damage done
would be acknowledged and paid for. We are sincerely sorry
to reverse the decision of a lower court of theory by a higher
court of actualities. '

On Monday of this week a valuable plate glass door was
ruined by a large group of students fooling around the front
entrance. No crime whatever in breaking a large pane of
glass. Probably only an accident. But nobody did it, no-
hody saw it, it just happened. We have no censure for the
party who did all the damage, perhaps in fun. But his action
revealed instantly his lack of manhood. His yellow streak
gleamed before his friends. .Perhaps he .fouldn’t pay for it,
but he could have done more! He could have acknowledged
it with his apology. He could have affirmed our faith in.
Bucknell students. But no not he. He is a believer in un-
fair play, an apostle of the “getting away with it” creed. If
he crawled in a skunk hole he’d win out in the battle of odors.
To reach his ideals you'd have to touch bottom in a mine
elevator. Just a man in reverse, a moral coward, a dirty con-
temptible cheap-skate, so little that even an Austin wouldn't
feel a bump. “And so far into the night.” “Also selected
short subjects.” Et cetera. But we won't condemn him en-
tirely. He is probably a stout defender against associating
Bucknell with a Federal Penitentiary. They might raise the
meral standards of low brows like himself.

To the other 99 percent of whom our high opinions has
changed but little, we wish you all a Merry Christmas.

extra period.

“Steam” Chenoweth was high scor- |
er in the game, making six two-
pointers, und one shot from the foul |
line, for a total of 13 pai ints. All
the St. Thomas players had a hand
in the scoring with the exception of
Coyne.

At the opening tap, Bucknell’s
only veteran players were Chenoweth

and Captain Norm Ross. Don Mills,/ while at the Coughlin High School, |j

Bill Smith and Jim Logan, were
playing their first varsity game, and
showed up very well. Both teams
had a good deal of trouble getting
used to the slppery floor. As the
game went on, they got the feel of
the floor, and a better hrand of ball }
was played.

A crowd of 1500 excited spectators
watched the game. A very exten-
sive program was prepared by the
Elks, who put on the game. After
the Bucknell-St. Thomas spree, an
exhibition game was put on by two
professional teams, after which the
spectators were admitted to the floor |

“Low Mutzel, Last
Year’s Ring Captain,
Gives Up Boxing

Coaches Uncertain How To Fill
Unlimited Weight Class
Post Made Vacant

The Bucknell boxers are rounding
imto excellent shape as the fight sea-
son draws nigh. With a fine start
and unusual enthusiasm, the squad
is training daily in anticipation of a
hard season.

Their workout consists of a four-
mile jog, periods with the weights,
sand-bag and leg exercises, and a
few rounds of sparing.

Since last year’s captain, “Lou”
Mutzel, who was to fight in the heavy-
weight class this year, has given up
boxing, the squad is in rather a
quandary as to how to fill this place.
The other classes will have no trouble
in turning out a first-class fighter.
In the 115-pound class especially,
there is keen rivalry, and “Trip”
Terpolilli will have to show his best
form to hold his position on the team.

AT COUGHLIN HIGH

“In this eorner we have Mr. A. L.
‘Mickey’ Boerner,” bellows the an-
nouncer, and the crowd gives the
little ‘boy a great big hand, for the
125-pounder is one of the most popu-
lar boxers ever to don Bucknell ring
regalia.

“Mickey” first pulled) on the gloves

| Wilkes -Barre. Every year, class
eliminations were held to determine
the champions of the various weights.

“Little Albert" first sprang into ]i
prominence as a boxer deluxe in his i
freshman year in high school, for, |:
fighting in the 112-pound class, he i

battered all his midget rivals into
submission. From that time on,
Boerner was invineible in the ranks
of the 112-pounders of Coughlin
High School.

After graduating from Coughlin
High, Boerner secured a seaman’s
job on # coastwise steamer, which
dropped him off at Mobile, Louisiana.
There, onee again, he took up the
noble art of self defense. Every
{port of note has its Seaman's Insti-
tute, a place where sailors gather to
have their recreation. A gymnasium
and athletic facilities are usually a
major part of the equipment of one
jof these sailor's retreats. It was in
|Mobile that Bucknell's 125-pound
boxer gained a wealth of experience
in working out in the gymnasium.

Trains Down

Boerner weighed 147 pounds when
he entered Bucknell two nnd one-half
year's ago. Not even his best friend
would have believed that he would be
fighting in the 125-pound class for
Bucknell that same winter, but
“Mickey” trained hard that fall.

When he entered school, Boerner
had a bad hip which handicapped
him quite a lot. Not being able to
play soccer with his classmates in
physical education periods, he werit
Into the gym and exercised with the
weights. His leg condition improved.
He trained down to 125 pounds in
five months, but his battle was not
over yet. The danger of taking pn
weight always lurked around the
corner. Kefore many of his bouts,
Boerner had te be extremely careful
of his eating, so that he would not
weigh in over the limit.

Frequently in the days preceding
a bout, he would eat just enough to
give him strength, for overeating or
even moderate eating would send the
dial of the scale’ whirling around
above the limit. After his bouts the
flashy little Bison would eat to his
heart’s content. Jt was no fun in
those dnys, for “Mickey” to fight for
Bucknell.

Last year, the Wilkes-Barre boy
did not have this weight handicap
staring him in the face to such a
great extent. This winter, he is in
great shape and gives promise of
having his best year. Although
“Mickey” is short on reach, he is jong

on punching power. In in-fighting|.

he excels for his thudding fists jolt]!
an opponent to the heels. He is a
careful boxer and is quick to take

‘advantage of an opening. Bucknell

fight followers nre looking forward
to seeing him having his best year.

[Cyril Kritzer,ex.’28

Writes Of Initial
Army- 1y-Navy Tussle

Is Doing feories, W With A “By-
Line,” For The Buffalo Even-
ing News

WAS SPORTS EDITOR

Cyril Kritzer, ex-’28, who was on
the sports staff of the Bucknellian,
is already getting a “by line.’ He
is now one of the Jeading sports
writers for the Buffalo Evening
News. That great newspaper is run-
ning a series of special articles about
football, which have been told to
Kritzer by Majoi* Albert D. Stayer,
U. S. Army, who played in the first
Army-Navy football game, in 1890.

Kritzer was unable to finish his
college work at Buckne!l, on account
of low finances. He regretfully left
Lewisburg and entered St. Bonaven-
ture, where he had been given a
scholarship and an opportunity to do
publicity work for the college.

After his graduation there he at
once secured a newspaper job, and
has forged rapidly ahead in journal-
ism. He started on one of the small-
er papers near Wilkes-Barre, and
won his way from paper to paper
until he landed on the Buffalo Even-
ing News, a publication with a cir-
culation close to 200,000. To write
sports news had always been Krit-
zer’s ambition, and he attained it
when this newspaper placed him on
its sports staff, which consists of
seven writers.

Though he did not graduate here,
Kritzer is very loyal to Bucknell, and
says that the newspaper work he did
here is the foundation of all the suc-
cess he has had in journallsm.

Many Pay Tribute To
Dr. Ephraim M. Heim

(Continued from Page 1.)
28, 1867, and received his early edu-
cation in the schools of that commun-
ity. Later, he attended the Muncy
Normal school and Keystone aca-
demy.

In 1889 he entered Bucknell, and
was graduated with the class of 1893,
receiving his Bachelor of Arts de
gree summa cum laude and winning
the first Herbert Tustin prize in
psychology and ethics. He won other
distinctions in college, in his junior
year receiving the Junior Oratorical
prize. In his freshman year he was
initiated into the Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity, and was always deeply
interested in that organization.

First Taught At Bucknell

Dr. .Heim’s first teaching position
was that of instructor in Latin at
the Bucknell Academy and Institute.
He took this job immediately ‘after
graduating from Bucknell. In 1895
Dr. Heim was granted the first
Charles Miller graduate fellowship
at the University of Chicago. The
fellowship was open only to grad-
uates of Bucknell. The following
year he was reappointed to the fel-
lowship and was given the privilege
of the house and library of Edward |
Hermann von Holst, eminent consti-
tutional historian, during the latter's
absence in Germany. In June, 1897,
he received the Master of Arts de-
gree from Chicago, and later in.the|,
year he returned to Bucknell and be-
came instructor in German and Latin.
A year after receiving his M. A., Dr.
Heim was awarded the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy by his
mater.

In 1898 Bucknell first offered
courses in economics and in that year
Dr. Heim hecame an instructor in
that department. The following year| j
he was made full professor and head
of the department of economics, a
position he held until his death, or
for 31 years. When the Charles P.
Vaughan chair of economics was
created in 1925 during the endow-
ment fund campaign, the first to oc
cupy it was Dr. Heim.

Dr. Heim was always popular with
students, and he had in his classes
approximately 3000 of Bucknell’s
5000 = alumni. He had literally
thousands of friends among Bucknell
men and women when he died. He |
was next to the oldest active mem-

MacCormack, for the affirmative,
stated that if we raise the world to
an international state, we would be
lowering ourselves to the position of
millions of uneducated Indians and
Africans, with the possibility of our
being ruled by them.

For the defense, Cohen and Wilson
claimed that nationalistic principles
contain inherent defects; that the
principles of nationalism are in re-
ality: “America, right or wrong,”
“Vive Ja France,” “Deutchsland Uber
Alles,” and that any nation will seek
to. crush another’s nationalism when
it is a check to aggrandizement.

Virginia Kandle, '32, to Assist
Artist Course Danseuse
In Rendering ‘Garconette’

“BALINESE RHAPSODY”
IS MOST FAMED DANCE

“The Balinese Rhapsody,” “The
Prelude in Blue,” and native gypsy
dances will be the featured numbers
of the world-famous interpretative
dancer, Ruth Page, who will appear
in the high school auditorium, Mon-
day evening at 8:30 o’elock as a pre-
sentation of the Artist Course.

“The Balinese Rhapsody” is one
of Miss Page’s most famous dances.
The origin of the dance is in Bali
a small island in the Dutch
Indies, off the south-east coast of
Java, where Miss Page learned these
dances of religion and pleasure from
the natives. “The Prelude in Blue”
is an interpretation of George Gersh-
win’s American jazz music. She has
taken all the movements of this
ballet from the charleston, black-
bottom,’ and other American jazz

steps.
- Coed to Assist

Virginia Kandle, '32, has been se-
lected to assist Miss Page in “Gar-
conette,” one of the famous dancer's
well-known creations. Miss Kanlle
will take the part of the Frénch maid
.in the dance. Miss Page will be as-
sisted at the piano by Louis Horst,
her accompanist.

Miss Page first became known for
her performance in John Alden Car-
penter’s “The Birthday of the In-
fanta,” which played in Chicago, and
for the last four seasons she has re-
turned there each summer. She also
spent two years as solo dancer at
the Metropolitan. She received much
favorable comment in the New York
Times on her last public appearance
in New York City on December 8 at
the Guild theatre. <

Hos Brilliant Career

Miss Page’s career has been wide-
ly diversified since she has danced
her way to fame in the famous thea-
trical districts of the world. She
‘was a member of Anna Paviowa’s
company in South America, Central
America, Mexico, and Cuba; princi-

) dancer of Irving Berlin’s Second
fusic Box Revue; the only American
dancer to perform with Diaghileff’:
Ballet Russe; premiere danseuse of
the Municipal era Company, Colon
theatre, Buenos Aires; the only
American artist to participate in the
enthronement ceremonies of the Ja-
Te, Emperor In the Imperial

heatre at Tokyo; the special guest
performer for the Prince of Siam in
the Varadis Palace at Bangkok; and
has daticed in many other famous
sections of the world.

Miss Page has been invited to give
six concerts of American dances by
the Sophil Society, formerly the
Philharmonic Orchestra of Moscow.
She will sail for Russia via Paris,
Berlin, and Warsaw, March 1, on the
Aquitania. :

Whyte Recovering

Prof. James P. Whyte is resting
well and is on the road to recovery,
according to the latest reports from
the Geisinger Memorial Hospital
where he underwent a major opera-
tion Wednesday morning for an ul-
cerated stomach.

Five members of the varsity foot-
. ball team, headed by Coach Carl G.
Snavely, reported to the hospital
Tuesday to volunteer their blood for

transfusion which the doctors had

necessary in preparation for
tion.  “Otty” Nied, Clark
Harry Fry, Frank Goodwin,
” Mutzel were the players

Tes isclosed that Hinkle, Mut-
zel, and Nied possessed the proper
blood classification to qualify for the
transfusion, and Mutzel was selected
for the donor. About a pint of his
blood was used. This is the second
time that Mutzel has given blood for
at ‘usion.

Prof. Whyte, who had been in ill
health for several weeks, was taken
to the hospital for observation dur-
ing the ristmas holidays,
operation which was performed three
days ago did not prove as serious
as was expected, and “Scotty’s” con-
dition has been steadily improving.

Three years old:

“Mudder, let's have turkey ’n plum
pudding 'n cranb’ry sauce every day.
T likes {t.”

At the end of the twelfth summer:

“Hey Bill. I’m chairman of the
refreshment committee for the Eighth

| Grade Picnic. Here’s my list of the

stuff we oughta have: ice cream,
fresh strawberries, boned  chieken,
ripe olives, angel food cake, fruit
punch, pickled tongue, and chicken
salad,”

The completion of the sixteenth year:

“And now, concerning © refresh-
ments for our Junior Prom, we ab-
solutely must serve hors d'ouvres,
biscuit tortoni, and non-ulcholoic Ver-
mouth. JT guess that will do, but
English cookies and French pastries
should really be included if we can
stand the expense.”

Maturity and) the (wenty-second birth-
day:

“Listen you guys. I’m the caterer
of this fraterntty house and you've
going to ext the food [serve or
starve. Mashed potatoes, — bread,
butter and milk is darn fine food iu
my mind. = Just the meal for the
middle of the day. What do you
want to be, » bunch of sissys, always
after the faney stuff? Common sub-
stantial food is one of the best things
in life and anyone who dovsn’t be-
lieve that is crazy.”

LETTER FROM A FATHER
Dear Son,

Although you are supposedly par-

tially paying your wny through col-

lead one to suppose that you had
made a down payment on the Library
and Chapel—I didn’t know they were
for sale. You asked how your sister
was, that you hadn’t heard from her
—I don’t believe you will—she is well
and fine but unfortunately your new

The House of Darkness is a novel by

the usual: novel of mystery and
adventure that we expeet KE. Phil-
lips Oppenheim to write. In this
latest of his novels, which is by no
means lacking in excitement, the
author advunces a theory for the
prevention of war that may indeed
be practicable. He has as_ his
hero, a man of enormous wealth
and power, whose sole aim is io
work towards the abolition of war.
He brings this plan to a successful
conclusion by securing a corner on
the gold of the world, and forcing
the politicians and financiers of the
countries of the world to accept a
treaty, the terms of which would
make any of them bankrupt, should
that nation start a war. With a
charming love plot to add the nec-
essary interest, one doesn’t find al
dull moment while reading the
book.

C. K. Scoggins that will soon be
published; it is at present running
in the Saturday Evening Post in
serial form. It is a tale of four
people, a mysterious young mun
from Kansas, who is tall and ex-
tremely blonde, an archaeologist
und his daughter, an aviator and
his mechanic. These four people,
the first two with a definite project
in mind, fly into the jungle of
Yucatan, seeking ancient ruins of
the Mayan civilization. Their
plane is wrecked and they are
obliged to cut their way out}
through the jungle. Of course,
they come upon some previously
unknown ruins, They are taken
by superstitious Indians'to be gous,
The tale is interesting in itself, but
to one who is interested in Mayan
archaeology it will be doubly so,
for Mr. Scoggins seems to be very |
well informed on that subject. |

CARL G. SNAVELY -
RECEIVES PATENT
ONFOOTBALLPAD

Coach’s New Iuvertion Used
‘By Buchnell Players;
Injuries Minimized

Carl G. Snavely, varsity football
coach, has been granted a patent for
a hip pad to be used for protection
of the hips and sides of football play-
ers. Manufacturing rights have not
yet been granted.

The pad has been used by Buck-
nell players since the Gettysburg
game of 1928 when there were sev-
eral bad hip and side injuries. Since
the Bucknell squad has used the
Snavely pads injuries of this nature
have been minimized.

Eight distinctive features of the
pad are listed by the patent oflice as
follows: “A body protective apparel
compromising a hip belt of flexible
cushion material, rigid hollow spher-
oidal sector shaped guar members
positioned on said belt so as to cover
the hip portions of the body, mmeans
for securing the guard members to
the belt, the base edges of said mem-
bers being curved to engage the
cushion materia] and conform to the
shape of the body.”

Dr. C. H. Garwood,
intendent of schools at Bloomsburg,
and William J. Schoonover, retired
business man of Scranton, who spoke

Dr. Garwood talked on

He said that the most serious prob- |
lem students face is to get into the
right vocation. He also warned
them not to get into “blind alley”
jobs. Opportunities in the educa-
tional field are in research, psychoi-
ogy, and home and school visiting.

Mr, Schoonover in his talk com-
pared life to a highway, saying that
one direction was the “commercial
way.” Side roads on the “commerce
way” are in agriculture, mining, and
manufacturing. Considering manu-
facturing as the most important of
these side roads Mr. Schoonover said,
“It js the people on this road that}
have made the United States the

world.”

Dodge Strikes Ford

The collision oecurred about 8:30
p. m., Monday, on the Susquehanna
trail just north of Milton. ‘The
Bressler car, a Dodge sedan, was
proceeding south when the wheels
caught in the trolley tracks on_the
right side of the road. When Mrs.
Bressler attempted to right the ma-
chine, it swerved across the higa-
way just as a Ford coupe, driven by
Mr. Chenoweth, approached _ from
Milton. The rear left of the Dodge
struck the front of the Ford and
both Mrs. Emma Bressler and her
daughter-in-law were thrown from
the machine to the highway.

Mrs. Emma Bressler received a
fractured skull and other injuries to
the face and head. The injured were
brought to the office of a Milton phy-
sician by a passing motorist. After
first-aid treatment they were taken
to the hospitals.

Miss Francis’ home is in Union-
town. She is pledged to the Pi Beta
Phi sorority. Mr. Chenoweth is from
Harrisburg and is a member of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

Mrs. Emma Bressler is survived by

‘her husband, William Bressler, and

one son and one sister.

and ‘adequate also in spiritual in-
sight and perspective to direct it for

Other questions which will make

Asteroid to Attract Star Gazers |
On Journey in Vicinity of Earth

‘The chief object of interest for the
next two weeks at the Bucknell Ob-
servatory will be the asteroid, Eros,
our nenrest neighbor in the solar
system, which will come closest to
the earth on January 30. An as-
teroid is a small planet or planetoid
which travels around the Sun on an
orbit lying between Mars and Jupi-
ter,

The. coming npproach will be the
nearest since Eros was discovered in
1898, and will be the nearest ap-
proach of the earth to any member
Its importance
lies in the fact that it will offer to
astronomers a means of checking op

PROGRAM TO INCLUDE |
MOZART OVERTURE)

A eoncert of the symphony orehes- |
tra, following the wave of approval
evoked by its recent chapel debut is
planned for late February or early
March, Professor Gies, conductor of
the organization, stated today.

The selections of the concert will
probably differ greatiy from those of |
the chapel program, though’ numer-
ous requests have been received for
the repetition of both the lyric com-
position, ‘“‘Hjertesar, Op. 34,” by Ed-
ward Grieg and the symphonic pvem,
“Finlandia,” by Jean Sibelius.

While the complete program has not
yet been «arranged for the sappear-
ance of the organization, the “Magic
Flute” overture by Mozart will be
included. The presentation of this
number is indicative of the orches- |
tra’s participation in the trend of the |
great symphonic organization's, re-
calling the recent successes of
European producers in the presenta-
tion of this master work. An out-
standing soloist will be engaged to
sing in this concert. ,

Of Recently-Found Gregorian

A first American performance of

music, written to accompany relig-
ious etchings by Dutch masters, is
planned by Paul Gies, asststant pro-
fessor of music, for the School of
Musie series next semester.

Contacts with prominent publish-

ers, made by the former director of
the Heidelberg Academy of Music,
secured for him and for Bucknell the
first score of fifteenth century music
to reach America.

The production of the music at
present is balked only by the lack of
tenors able to sing the music which
only a few American choirs dare at-
tempt. Professor Gies
these to complete a chorus of twenty
to present the program.

The discovery of this combination
of music and etchings is of decided
historical importance in that the pic-
tures show musical instruments,
that the compositions mention them
and reflect their influence. “They
point out clearly that
music was accompanied by instru-
ments rather than sung a capella,”
declared Professor Gies, who, af
a five years’ study of western chure!
music, had hetd to the “a capella’

belief.

Phi Kappa Psi, the first fra-

the house one gets an inspiring view.
The lodge is a three-story brick

Fourth View Book,
“Life at Bucknell,”

New Edition Printed In Green
Ink On Ivory Paper With
Many Illustrations

A new edition of the booklet mada

and Binding Company, and Registrar |
H. W. Holter is mailing copies to all}
the alumni as well as to prospective |
students. The publication is 12x
inches in size and is printed in green |
on ivory paper, with a wealth of!
phdtographic illustrations. The |
cover carries the beautiful photo-)
graph of Old Main that was used on|
the Bucknell calendar of 1928. lt is
printed in three colors.

This present edition of this boohlet |
is the fourth. The first edition was
prepared in 1926 by Professor Lewis
E. Theiss. It was 6x9 inches in
size, and was replete with photo-
graphs of Bucknell subjects tken by
Mr. Vincent Smith and Professor
Nelson F. Davis. Two years later a.|
second edition was issued. It was
of the same size, but the cover hac
heen altered, as well as some of the
illustrations.

The third edition, issued in 1929,
saw the book entirely revised. It
was cut down slightly in size, and the
frontispiece, a reproduction of Mr.
Smith’s photograph of the front_of
Old Main, was done in colors, Ree
thumbnail sketches and red _ initial
letters and outlines added vivacity
to the text.

When Dr. Theiss revised the book
for the third time, in preparation for |
this new edition, he made practically |
a new book. The text was elmost
doubled in amount, the size of the]
pages greatly increased, and a cover
in three colors prepared. Many of
the beautiful large photagraphs used
in recent L’Agendas were repeated
in this book.

This combination is a part of Len
Osborn’s orchestrn, “The Campus
Collegians,” and consists of a piano,
two violins, two trumpets, two saxo-
phones, a trombone, a_ banjo, and
drums. Howie Koyen and Osborn
are the vocal soloists.

This is the second time that Os-
born has cooperated with the faculty

To Revise Rules

Plan Results From Report
Of Ann Sprout On Xmas
Meeting In South

FACULTY TO HELP

A commission to simplify and re-
vise the rules and regulations re-
garding the conduct of Bucknell eo-
eds will be formed as a result of the
Women's Student Government Asso-
ciation meeting held last night, Ro
berta S. Slifer, 31, president of the
women's self-governing body, an-
nounced today. The commission will
be composed of students and inter-
ested faculty members.

Decision to form a commission
came as a result of the report o
Ann Sprout, ’81, on the conference of
the National Student Federation of
America held at Atlanta, Georgia,
during the Christmas holidays.

In her report she indicated that
Bucknell is far behind the standards

of other colleges in the matter of | objective

student government. Out of a group
cussion group, 40 had the honor sys-
tem, and 28 of these considered it
successful. Schools which had found
it most successful were those which
had had it longest.

In the discussion which followed
Miss Sprout’s report, one coed, in a
foreeful and emphatic manner, de-
clared that the present student gov-
ernment rules at Bucknell were ar-
chaic and failed to consider vital
questions.

After the coeds had indicated their
desire for a committee that would
make a study of a possible course of
action, Miss Slifer warned the stu-
dents that nothing could be accom-
plished in a short time.

Director Gies Plans
To Improve Band
By 2 New Rulings

ay Excuse Band Musicians
From Certain Gym Classes
For Efficiency’s Sake

That the University pand may be
lable to compete with other univers
jity and college bands is the aim of
Paul Gies. director. With this iden
in mind, he has drawn up two new
regulations. He is endeavoring t
have band members excused fron
certain gvm classes, to insure a more
efficient band, and to remedy the
practice of taking band members
from their studies for evening re-
hearsals.

Inquiries have proved that mem
bers of other college bands are ex
cused from certain physical training
periods. “Steps have been taken tc
secure the same advantages for our
hand,” slates Mr. Gies. He claims
that such a practice at Bucknell
would make our band better able to
compete with other bands, which re-
ceive physical credit for their work.

Draws Up Regulation

The two regulations which have
been drawn up are:

1, No present band member who
does not take active partin all band
activities in two semesters will be
able to play at any future occasions.

2. Band keys will be given only
to those members who have been
loyal to the organization for three
full years.

“‘Sam’’ Crabb’s Museum Pieces
Monuments To The Absent-Minded

That the “Semites” and the engi-
neers are about to steal the aura of
forgetfulness from the “absent-mind-
ed professor” is the opinion of “Sam”
Crabb, who as master of the lost and
found department, is a_ collector
whose omnivorous activity rivals
that of the curators of the world’s
greatest museums.

Speaking of lost vanity cases, the
barometer of feminine, forgetfulness,
the veteran Yolleptor said, “There
aren’t as many lost this year as last
year, but the girls still lose more
things than the men.”

A choice group of polyphase slide-
rules similarly incriminates the en-
gineers. However. an aggregation
that rivals the Smithsonian Institu-
tion in everything but excess dust,
and which excells even the British
Museum in complexity, contains
items of greater interest and rarity
than the all too common evidences
of “semites’” and engineers’ infirm:
ity. .
A full enumerntion of the Crabb
museum pieces would demand a cata-

logue which would necessarily be out
of date before it could appear in
print, yet a few of the more choice
items can searcely be ignored. Type
specimens of not a few species of
pencil caps, leads, and erasers, of
fountain pen tops, and of ink and
pencil erasers repose in the depart-
ment.

A series of collar buttons and cuff
links illustrating the development of
these articles and paralleling the
development of Bucknell styles since
the '80’s is one of the most valuable
heritages of the present regime. An-
other is a still recognizable fossil of
the species, Dinkus  Bucknellensis,
which geologists agree dates back
before the Fountain period of Buck-
nell hazing. Other specimens of
more recent Quadrangle times are
fairly numerous in varying condition.

The status of this remarkable col-
lection, however, is not on a very firm
basis, The priceless articles, rang-
ing from glasses to shoe horns, may
be lost to the curator at any time
by their identification by former
owners.

Dr. Lund Publishes
His Second Book,
“Emotions of Men”

Work Presents Prevailing
Psychological Ideas
In Unusual Way.

By Kenneth A. Haynes, 731

Few professors have been able to
stimuate student thought to such a
high degree as did Dr. Frederick H.
laind, who transferred his affiliations
from this campus to that of Temple
University in September, after hav-
ing completed two years as head of
our department of psychology. Dur-
ing the latter part of his stay here
he managed, despite the pressure of
his teaching activities, to gather ma-
tertal for a volume treating on popu-
jar psychology, which has just been
published by the new nontechnical di-
vision of the McGraw-Hill Book Co.

-Whittlesey Flouse.

“Emotions of Men" is the very ap-}
propriate title for this, the second |
psychological publication of Dr. Lund.|
Written around the hypothesis tha)
man js not a rational being, but that
his actions are governed largely by
“motion, this volume is a textbook
in a technical sense, for it is designed
for the lay reader, and all of its
terms are carefully explained.

in this scholarly volume will be more

since it is the means of obtaining

which are often socially obnoxious.

Includes Class Teachings

Those who knew Professor Lund
will find him reflected upon every|
page, for he has included many of his|
class teachings in this book. His
style is a bit dogmatic, and his
thoughts are expressed with perfeet-
ly chosen words. His former stu-
dents will recognize his belief in
eause and effect, the supremacy of
science over religion, and the unreal
nature of chance.

native of New Zealand, he sought!
his fortune first in Norway and then
in the United States. Tfis expenses |
in the higher schools of lerrning
were defrayed by practicing the
trade of bricklaying. He attempted
to study for the ministry, but gave
it up for psychological study. And
while still in his early thirties, with
a Ph. D. after his name, he publishe
his first book. Now, with the com
ing of his second book, he has given
to his field an authoritative treatise
which is entirely readable to th
iverage person, and extremely ab-
sorbing to the student.

MENTAL PARALYSIS
One of the frequent charges
against this University is that it i:
yrovincia that
The students on this

hearted interest in their own activi
ties to the exclusion of consideration
of what occurring in the outer
world. Several organizations here
have tried to broaden our outlook by
bringing speakers from without to
arouse us from our apathy, but we
continue to give an excellent simula-
tion of partial mental paralysis.
Now, another and commendable ef- |
fort is being made to introduce a

most
an searce

} petitions being

| salesmanship.

For years college students have
been fighting compulsory
training. During the last few years,
resistance has grown so rapidly that
seven colleges have dropped compul-
sory drill and seven others have
abandoned even elective courses.
Realizing that studeuts in such uni-
versities as Towa and Florida cannot
win by themselves, a nation-wide
student protest is soon to be present-
ed to Congress. Thoughtful Buck-
nellians would do well to sign the
circulated on our

campus,

Of course, the real danger in mili-
tary training is subtle. The R.O.T.C.
is mainly interested in’ getting
students automatically to think
“war when the signal is given. It
teaches an irrational attitude of mili-
tary obedience, and casts a false
glamor over the trenches that makes
a nation rush eagerly to be buried in
them.

lf the R. O. T. C. were realistic in
its training, it would cut out the polo
ponies, snappy uniforms, cute girl
colonels, and dress parades. Instead
it would substitute the digging of
trenches, familiarity with bad food
and certain forms of animal life, and
the techniques involved in the use of
poison gases. The “cute colonels”
would take up knitting, nursing, and
War never was col-
legiate despite the efforts of the
O. T. C.! Let’s enjoy the luxury of
moral integrity and give the system

a good solid boot!

APALLING APATHY

Bucknell’s provincialism is discuss-
ed in another editorial in these col-
umns this week from the standpoint,
primarily, of student government.
The student culture aspect of the
ituation is not dealt with, and it i=
this problem which we take up now.

‘The large audience at the perform-
ance of that brilliant dancer, Ruth
Page, bore witness to the fact that
not all of Bucknell is solely engaged
in nothing but sports, dates, and
book But the small response to
the request that stndents sign the
resolution favoring the immediate en-
trance of the United States in the
World Court again emphasizes our
provincialisin.

Are Bucknellians so busied with
the little world of their own that
they do not care to express them-
selves on the greatest international

fresh stream of thought in our col-| problem of the present day? Their

legiate consciousness, and it originat- |
ed in the Women’s College. The

apathy in regard to the resolution
would seem to indicate just that. We

ciation sent a delegate to the sixth

A news release is sent out every
week by the N.S. F. QO. A. to keep
its members up to date with what is
happening ‘on other campuses. It
does not limit its news to national
collegiate interests, but extends them
to foreign universities. It is through
this organization that American col-
leges, including Bucknell, obtain the
foreign debiting teams which visit
us every year. |

Participation in the projects of the
crganization would be of value to the
men of Bucknell because of the deep
interest and activity the N.S. F. 0.,

seems clear: the movement gives
earnest of justifying the hopes of its
advocates and of deserving the full-
est measure of enthusiastic encour-
agement. Five volumes of Bucknell
verse have appeared since 1926, and
they are no exception to this state-
ment. The current volume muain-
i tains a high degree of merit, and
may be cited as an argument—if any
be needeil at this stage—in favor of
\the publication of Bucknell verse in
| particular, and undergraduate verse
in general.

way but just isn’t up to some of our
modern questions. She probably
knows her lines well enough when it
is a question of entering a ballroom,
but who wants to enter a ballroom?
What modern folks need is informa-
tion on how to enter a rumble seat.

This is really a distressing ques-
tion at times. For one thing no one
ever wants to ride in a rumble seat
anyway. What, then, to do, when a
party of four prepare to tour in a
roadster ?

Of course, the old advice to use
your common sense won't hold, for
then the fur coated girls would oe-
cupy the rumble seat, while the
feeble and shivering males would
journey in comfort inside. In fact,
think as you will upon the subject,
there is no satisfactory way of de-
ciding without {1 will just who shall
occupy this invention of the devil.

Well, we will leave this question
to chance and fraternity politics and
proceed.

HERE’S HOW

Immediately a great doubt arises.
Just what is the ethical and moral
manner to enter a rumble seat?
Shall you exclaim, “Look at the air-
plane.” and sneak in while no one is
watching, or brazenly risk modesty
and dignity by performing the feat
before the eyes of all? Or should
you try the common and vulgar
method of diving in head first and
hoping nature will take its course
and meanwhile praying that you
have not looked upon daylight for
the last time. More important still,
should women ever enter rumble
seats ?

We really think that Emily should
bring us up to date concerning the
matter for uncertainty is madden-
ing. Here are a few questions which
we really wish she would settle:once
and for all while she is on the sub-
ject: |

Father Of Dr. Davis:
Dies At Age Of 83

Nerbert Davis, father of Professor
Yrank G. Davis, head of the depart-
ment of education, died Sunday, Jan-
vary 4, at his home in Warsaw
township. He was 88 years of age.

Mr. Davis was taken seriousty ill
last May. After undergoing a ma-
jor operation, he rallied, but a recur-

rence of chronic rheumatism and his
weak heart brought on the finn) at-
tack.

His life was spent .chiefly on the
farm which had belonged to his
father. A life-long member of the
Methodist Episcopal church, he
served for many years as an official
in it.

K. D. R’S SURPRISE

The annual Inter-fraternity  bas-
ketball league swung into action last
Friday night with two interesting
games.

‘Medicine Man Kling Twists
Adhesive ’Round and ’Round

“Oh Peachy! Where's the adhesive
tape?” Peachy Kling, trainer und
{major domo for the football, base-
ball, basketball, track, boxing, and
soccer teams, Jistens to and answers
| this ery every day during the school
year.

He has more uses for adhesive tape
than a medicine show man has guar-
antees for his snake oil remedy.
Ankles are taped, socks are support-
ed, ripped football jerseys‘and pants
are mended, schedules are stuck to
the walls, name tags are put on lock-
ers, bat handles are wrapped, pack-
ages are sealed, bottles are stopper-
ed, and shoelaces are improvised, all
}from this useful commodity, adhesive
| tape. It takes the place of band-
ages, string, thread, nails, screws,
paste, and other articles too numer-
ous to mention:

Use 200 Rolls
_ According to the same Peachy, who
is supreme ruler of the domain

“JACK” DEMPSEY,

{
|
bounded by the locker and equipment
roonis, the athletic department uses
a little over 200 rolls of tape each
year. The rolls ave twelve inches
wide and ten yards long. If all this
tape were in one strip an inch wide ;
it would stretch around the running
track in the stadium 55 times, or if
extended along the road to Harris-
burg, it would reach three miles past
Sunbury, or {if rolled into a single
roll it would be twenty-five feet in
diameter. 7

The football team uses a major
portion of the tape. It is estimated
that each of the 30 odd players on
the squad uses 250 feet of this tape
every season just to have his ankles
taped for the game.

We could go on and tel! of all the
balls, bats, shoes, and other pieces of
equipment that are used during the
year but as adhesive tape {ts an easy
subject to stick to we will let it go
at that.

Eighteen Points
T. U. O'S BARELY WIN

The Sigma Chi bnsketeers  sub-
merged the Delta Kappa Phj team
under an avalanche of goals, 51-16,
in the first’! inter-fraternity game
Monday evening. Rose led the vie-
tors’ offense, with nine baskets. Ber-
ley and Wheeling each tallied eight
points for the losers.

The “Sigs” jumped into the lead
at the outset, giving an exhibition of
fine team play. The Delta Seure
Phis played) gamely but seldom
brought the ball within scoring dis-
tance. At the start of the second
quarter, Sigma Chi sent in an en-
tirely new team, but this combina-
tion did not show the finished team
play of the first team.

The Sigs were leading 34-6 at the
half. In the second half the Sigma
Chi team slowed down without giv-
ing their opponents too much chance,
and garnered 17 points to the Delta
Kappa Phis 10.

Campus Club Drops

The Campus Club dribblers in the
second game of the evening, extend-
el the Theta Upsilon Omega team
in the fastest fray to date, only to
lose in the final few minutes 41-40.

oe eK KH
Hockey And “Little Eva”

In a hot radiator league discussion
avith two prominent Bucknellians the
other day, the subject of ice hockey
came up and the question was
broached whether or not there could
be enough interest stirred up in a
hockey team to warrant a sextet.
It’s a matter of common knowledge
that the Susquehanna is flowing
under a foot or more of ice these
days and the townspeople are mar-
veling at the fine condition of the
river's ice. If it’s a hockey team
that Bucknell needs, now is the time.

How Business Depression Tests

GOOD-WILL

Many a manufacturer during the past year
has had an opportunity to measure as never
before the real worth of his advertising invest-

ment:
eer Cae He has seen his trade-mark line keep in
& sales and his unadvertised goods shrink to a
& small fraction of their former volume. — In-
numerable instances could be cited.

Dealers can tell the same story. The
number of makes carried of each item has
shrunk to a very few--in comparison to that of,
former years. Dealers have changed their
point of view; they no longer stock lightly with
® many brands; but substantially with a few.

Quick turnover is their only salvation in a depression and

their real source of profit im a prosperous period.

THE BUCKNELLIAN offers merchants and dealers
the opportunity, for a quick turnover, by offering its columns for
: their use. There are a thousand students with a million

About five winters ago, Coach John|

Included on that team were — such!
Bucknell athletes as “Arch” Seiler,
“Eddie” (Halicki, “Bernie” Kloster-

Frable.

Bucknell’s team was on parade and,
under inspection the night it took the!
floor against the West Pointers, al-
though the men were unconscious of
that fact.

About a week after. the game,
Coach Plant received a letter from
the West Point authorities commend-
ing his team as being the finest
group of men to represent any visit-
ing school on the Army floor that
winter. The letter further stated
that Bucknell had risen to a highly

Drastic Changes,
Says Dr. Vaughan

Trustees Do Not Want To
Hurry In Selecting
New President

ATTENDS RECEPTION
GIVEN BY PHI PSIS

“We do not contemplate making
any drastic changes at Bucknell dur-
ing Dr.* Hunt's absence. In_ fact.
that is furtherest from our minds,”
said Dr. Charles P. Vaughan, acting
president, before he left Lewisburg]
for his home in Philadelphia Satur- |
day afternoon.

“Of course, we are all very sorry
to lose President Hunt, who plans to |
leave with his family next Thursday
for a six-weck’s vacation at Mount
Dora, Florida,” he added. “Our moot
difficult task now is to find the right
man to replace him.”

Asked if he expected the sclection
of Dr. Hunt’s successor to be made |
soon he said, “We don’t want to}
hurry our selection too much. It is
important that we get the right man
and one upon whom we can all
agree.”

Meets Faculty Committee

While in Lewisburg, Dr. Hunt met |
with the faculty committee appoint-
ed to cooperate with the trustees in
the selection of a new president.

During their stay here Dr. and
Mrs. Vaughan were the guests of
President and Mrs. Hunt. They were
dinner guests at the Women's Col-
lege Friday evening where they were
entertained with songs hy the coeds.
Thirty members of the faculty and
administration were present at the
dinner, |

Later in the evening he and Mrs.
Vaughan attended the formal recep-
tion for the faculty given by the Phij|
Kappa Psi fraternity.

tests are to be given at the In-
firmary, between the hours of 11
a.m. and 6 p. m. tomorrow. They

ill be given free of charge to all
students and members of the fac-

COED COMMISSION
WILL SIMPLIFY

LEWISBURG, PA., THURS DAY, JANUARY 22, 1931.

In a small alcove just off the
“muchly-treaded” library lobby, this
downtrodden generation has found a
champion, for those who represent it
have discovered that the dignified
figure, fondly called “the baroness of
the bookshelves,” who holds forth in
that well-shelved office, actually be-
lieves that modern collegians are
moral beings with more than a shred
of modesty.

Think you this not a courageous
statement in these days? For some
perhaps, but not for Miss Elza Mar-
tin. She is not a timid soul, because
she has been among young people all
her life, and her observations are ac-
curate.

lias Made Changes

Since Miss Martin took the library
under her wing several years ago,
and proceeded to bring about the
many changes which have so aided
the students, she has been making
observations for her own satisfaction.
She wanted to find out if the younger
generation was as bad as it was

X-ray Later

A Coolidge Universal X-ray Tubs
has been purchased by the depart-
ment of physics, and it is being in-
stalled in a second floor room of
East College by L. M. Roupp.

The x-ray machine will be used for
research and therapy. Dr. Lester P.
Fowle plans to use it Jater in the
year for x-raying broken bones and
for other medical purposes. Ad-
vanced experiments
will be conducted by members of the
department of physics faculty. c

At present, Professor Frank Bur-
pee’s men are installing direet und
alternating electric current, gas and
water facilities in the room. The
room will be used for advanced ex-
periments in clectricity as well as for
x-ray research.

The department also purehased a
high voltage transformer and a reeti-
fier to be used with the Coolidge
tuhe. The tube can be operated on
a current of as high as 90-000 volts,
a fairly high voltage to protect the
operator. The department expects
to be able to start experiments with-
in two weeks.

Two very young dogs, species un-

the thought exercised for the comfort

ldozens of shower and bath rooms,

{find much to do behind the lights,
are among the most prominent ap-

point of many budding romances. |

A whole floor is devoted to songs
and songwriters, and it is here that

Ovid’s Influence On
Art Subject Of Talk

The influence of Ovid on art and
literature, and on the whole modern
conception of classic mythology, will
be discussed tonight by Dr. H. W.
Robbins in the fifteenth lecture of
the series of the World Literature
course,

Ovid spans the time from B. C. to
A.D. He was the last of a Jong line
of great poets, which began with
Lucretius and ended with himself,
He is superficial, and less reverent,
compared with Virgil and Horace.
Nevertheless, in power and imagina-
tive vision, Ovid {s surpassed by no
ancient, and by few modern poets.

{His influence was first felt in the
Italian Rennissanee. It passed from
thence to France. From France it
was carried to England, where Chau~
cey was the first to feel the Ovidian
tradition. The minds of Shakespeare,
‘Marlowe, Spenser, Milton, and Dry-
were moulded through his
poetry.

Within one hundred years in Amer-
ican literature, so important a writer
us Hawthorne expressed the influence
exerted by Ovid in “Wonder Rook”
and “Panglewood Tales.”

One handicap, according to Mr.
Gilmore, that should he — avoided
above all others is that of mental
laziness, Very often this trait. is
developed through college habits and
is carried on into industry.

Five years ago the mortality rate

{of college graduates lost to industry

through misapplication was 50 per-
cent. This has now been practically
by personnel work. Where
the cause, before, was the

Dr.Childs Speaks
ToBusiness Women
At Club Meeting

Analyzes Citizenship In Some
Of its Modern Relations;
Sees Franchise Loss

Prof. Harwood Childs was the
speaker of the evening at the Jan-
uary dinner meeting of the Business
and Professional Women’s Club of
Lewisburg.

Dr, Childs spoke on citizenship in
some of its modern relations. He
said that We are losing the value of
our franchise beeause of increasing
population whieh glves each individ-
val a relatively smaller pluce in gov-
ernmental affairs; because of the
complexity of political problems,
such as public utilities; beeause of
the increasing activities of the gov-
ernment, Pennsylvanin, for instance,
having about twenty committees in
1850, whereas it now has more than
forty; because of tnereasing propa-
ganda which makes it difhicult for
people to judge a question accurate-
ly.

Increase in| Organizations

Our exercise of franchise is, how-
ever, less needful, due to an increas-
ing number of organizajons such as
associations, leagues, and service or-
ganizations of all sorts. Sach of
these organizations has an inform-
ant’ in Washington acting as an eye.
Today, leaders feel that jt doesn’t
matter much who holds office in the
government as long as pressure can
be brought to bear to pass needful
legislation.

He said that some rulers think the
recovery of Influence is not desirable,
as for instance in the case of Italy.
Other writers, feeling that it is de-
sirable, suggest that it can be ac-|
complished by study. | They advise
people to devote two hours a week
to study and another two hours to
discussion. Walter Lippman say
that nerhaps the most effective use
of sufferage today is in establishing
standards by which we may judge
the probable efficiency of men and
policies.

George Ade Pricks
Bubble Of Those
“Good Old Days”

Humorist Takes Romance
Away From Eighties;
Labels Them Prosaic

“As I check over the primitive con-
ditions and the limited opportunities
of the far away eighties, I can think
of only one great privilege we -en-
joyed which is now denie| the stu-
dent of any inland college,” reveals
George Ade in his article on “The
Gray Kighties” in the February Col-
lege Humor. “We were given the
best that the theatre had to offer and
the expense was trifling. Music, the
drama, food, stimulation and tobacco,
all rounded cut an evening of riotous
living for a grand total of four bits!
But student life, outside of the class

. work and the literary societies, was

just plain starvation.
Vartakes of Supper

“In the eighties it was the fashion
for young men to go out serenading
at night—standing around in the
moonlight, singing very sentimental
songs to young women who were
concealed behind curtains above. As
1 look back upon it, it strikes me
that this nocturnal practice never led
up to anything worth talking about
and was simply another evidence
that we were not half as devilish as
we thought we were.

“I am going to wind up this dis-
course with the story of what the
average sophomore or junior really
did in one day away back yonder.
(Ne arose from a straw tick in a most
unattractive room at about seven-
thirty a. m. and ran to a boarding-
house where he ate a frugal break-
fast, consisting largely of oatmeal.
Soon after eight o’clock he went to
a recitation and at nine he went to
another and at ten he attended
chapel! Uusally he had a third reci-
tation in the morning and ate dinner
About twelve-thirty. He did most of

his Iab or shop work jn the after-!

noon. When that was over he was
practically through for the day.
Serenades the Fashion
“Along about sun-down he strolled
out and partook of a modest meal
which was known as supper. On nine
nights out of ten he had nothing to
do after that except go to his room
and sit down and talk or study a
little or pop corn over a gas burner
or play a few hands of penny-ante.
He didn’t devote any time to house-
keeping and his evenings were un-
disturbed by the present feverish!

The Collegian, Penn
paper, quotes Thomas A. Edison anid
Prof. John A. Ferguson, head of th«
Forestry School at Mount Alto, as
believing that a student in college
should work from eight to ten hours
a day. At the Mount Alto school
the freshmen are occupied from eight
o'clock in the morning unttl four
o’clock in the afternoon. In addition
to this, a two-hour study period is
held every night except during the

Randolph Churchill Reveals All

In an interview granted to The La-
fayette, organ of Lafayette College,
the sonof Winston Churchill, of Eng-
lish political fame, revealed that
“Women are vastly inferior to men.
Their brains are smaller, and they
definitely lack power of concentration
which Is necessury to a great mind.
There have been few grext feminine
leaders in history. There have been
really only two, Joan of Are and
Aimee Semple MacPherson, but both
have led entirely through emotional
appeal.” Oh, to be Randolph’s big
emotional appeal! That would be

“A brilliant student—one who can
bluff class and get high marks and
then tell the rest of the students how

tests to see if the individual can

A trip to West Point to engage the
Army in fistic combat is the order of |
the day for the following Saturday
the 28th of February. This is the |
first time Bucknell has met the Army |}
in boxing and the meet hould be a
good one. Army has the reputation
for turning out fighters.

Bucknell will repay West Vir-
ginia's visit of last year, by journey-
ing to Morgantown on March 11 to
meet the Mountaineers in their own
ring. ast season the Bisons defeat- |
ed the Morgantowners by a five to}
two score. West Virginia has almost
the same team which came to Lew-
ishburg last year. Captain Kregs,
who fought in the one sixty class,
being the only man lost to them by
graduation. In view of this fact, the
meet shoul be an interesting one.

Temple, Bucknell's — oldest fistic
rival, will be met in Lewisburg on
March 14. The Philadelphians are
always represented by a strong box-
ing team and they put on full steam
when they encounter the Bisons.

Another Home Meet

There will be another meet in the
home ring but as yet a suitable op-
ponent hus not been selected. This
will be announced in the near future,
and it has been rumored that the
Carnegie Tech team of Pittsburgh |
had been approached on the subject.

With this attractive schedule, and
the bright ontlook for a strong team,
Bucknell should have a highly suc-
cessful season. It is hoped that in
the near future Bucknell may be in-
vited to enter the Intercollegiate
Boxing Association. There are men
on the Bison team who would have a
very good chance jn their welghts in
this competition.

E. Williams turned in the highest
score: for the Kappa Sig's with a
total of 10 points. Sipe offered &
points for his share of the game for
the Alpha Chis.

The yame was hotly contested
throughout, the Kappa Sigma outfit
jeading by one point at the half.
The Chi Mus fought spiritedly in the
second period but the Kappa Sigma
aggregation held on and increased
their lead another point before the
fina! whistle, the game ending 27-25.

Ammerman lead the offense for the
S. A. E’s with 20 points. Hinkle
collected 17 and Fry 14, to total 5

noni was high seorer for the Alpha
Delts with a contribution of 7 points.

Against the size and weight of the
K. A. E. team, the A. P. D.’s were
almost helpless and couldn’t break
through for a free shot at the basket.
The first half ended with the Sig
Alphs way out front 28-4. The
second half was almost a repetition
of the first, the leaders filling out
their total with 33 more points, while
the opposing boys found 9 more, and
the game ended 62-13.

These two games are the fast on

Construction Of Ring Expected
To Make Improvement
In Fighting

With the inter-class bouts behiad
them, and the intercollegiate openiag
only a few weeks away, the B. U.
boxers have settled down to the long
training grind of the season.

Most of the men are in good shape
and are getting close to their fight-
ing weight, while a few are having
trouble getting rid of extra pound-
age. The bouts last Friday night
showed that a few of the boys are
not in quite the shape they should be
The lower weight seemed weakest.
In the one fifteen bout both Terpoliili
and Cohen seemed to slow down cor-
siderably in the early part of — the
second round.

One feature which has affected
Bucknell’s boxers in the past is being
remedied. Heretofore it was neces
sary to do all boxing and sparring
on the cement floor downstairs in
Tustin gym. The result was that
when the men entered the ring they
were not accustomed to the give of
the mats under their feet. This
caused them to tire much more quick-
ly than should have heen the case
|'Now a ring is under construction

a deeided advance over the previous
conditions, and it shows a growing
interest in the step-child of the Ath-
letie Council.

Bucknell alumni from all parts of
the tri-state district will be able to
see the Bisons in action this year, as
the schedule calls for an appearance
in West Virginia and New York. It
is possible that a bout may be ar-
ranged for Pittsburgh as well.

Russo Leaves Team

“Lou” Russo, a hard hitting boy
who has been out for the team in the
one sixty class, has decided to give
up boxing for this year.

Russo gave as his reason the
heavy scholastic duties which he
thought would suffer if he continued
with boxing. The Trenton boy had
been training with Bucknell’s new
and popular coach, Joe Reno, during
the past summer. He showed im-
proved form in taking an extra round
decision from “Red” Wilkenson in
the inter-class bouts.

Another difficulty which confronted
“Lou” was the question of making
the weight. He has been training
for some time, and still exceeds the
limit by several pounds. This mat-
tor of taking off weight is a tough
one, for one must be careful not to
sacrifice strength.

Captain Marchesane will have a
chance to get even with the West
Virginia man who gained a decision
over him last yesr. “Marehy” will
undoubtedly meet the same map
again this yeur as they are v~ach
firhting in the same weight clans

Ninety-two footballs were lost or
stolen at the University of Pitts-
burgh this fall according to the
United Press. There must be as
many youngsters at Pitt who like to
play football as there are at Buck-
nell. In these days of “over empha-
sis,” it may be assumed, we suppose,
that Pitt provides a football for each
man on the varsity squad.

days. In practice, “Psychological
Cy,” has had difficulty in finding the
rim, but in action—that’s a different
matter. Marter was a valuable
guard Jast winter. His work on the
New York trip augurs well for Buck-
nell, for there’s always a scoring
threat and defensive star in reserve
if the regulars falter. 3

“Marehy's” timing was good and his

mary. It looks like the captain will

Close Encounter

The Bienus-Voet fight started out|
to bearip-roaring encounter between |
two hard mitting boys who were)
rendy to mix tt up. Vogt, showing
a surprising development over last
year, was fighting a very nice fight
and had the powerful Bienus cover-
ing up on several occasions to avoid
a flurry of hard rights, Late in the
first round, after almost two minutes
of torrid milling Vogt suffered a dis-
location of the shoulder. The in-
jury was an old one, and the shoulder
wns thrown out when Vogt was lead-
ing a hard right to his opponent's |
head. A technieal knockout termin-
ated what promised well to be a
sweet combat. Vogt wished to con-
tinue, but it was not thought advis-
able, and Coach Reno waved hint to
the hench.

The stage was well set for the next
bout which proved the best of the
night. Wilkenson entered the ring
out-weighed by~something over ten
pounds. He is a natural onr forty-
fiver, but he was matehed in the one
sixty division. Russo, whose right
hand is always loaded for bear, was
in the other corner. The first round
was fast, and few solid blows were
exchanged, “Red” Wilkenson lauded
effectively ne less than six left hooks
to the midsection, in close sucees-
sion, to pile up a nice lead. fe was
blocking cleverly and Russo’s hard
rights were going over the shoulder.

Chenoweth Missing
On New York Trip
Due to Suspension

Loss of High Scoring Forward
Keenly Felt by Teammates
In Week’s Games

William J. “Steam” Chenoweth,
the sharp-shovting, high scoring
Bison forward, was not permitted to
make the New York basketball trip
with his teammates by the univers-
ity authorities. Chenoweth drew a
suspension of one week as a resivt
of » reeent auto crash In which he
was a party

The Hatrisburg boy's loss 9 was
keenly felt in the team play against
the Crescent A. C., Manhattan, and
the Army. Chenoweth led the Bison
scorers in their first two games
against the Lewisburg Troop team
and Lafayette. The fast Httle for-
ward has rolled in 1 field and six
foul goals for a 32 point total.

Coach John PD. Plant expects to
use the former John Harris High
star against Colgate, January 80. |

The round ended with no damage
done.
jets Range Better

Russo got the range a little better
in the second frame, and connected
several times with hard rights to the
head, Wilkenson countered sharply
to keep Russo at his distance. A
clinch at the ropes resulted in both
men being wrestled to the floor out-
side the ring. The round ended with
neither having any decided advant-
age. The third round was a repeti-
tion of the first. Russo swung hard
rights, but missed frequently, while
Wilkenson's short rights to the head
piled up points for him. Toward the
end of the round the going began to |
get rougher and Russo cut “Red's”
early round lead down with several |
jarring rights.

It looked Jike Wilkenson's — fight,
but the judges disagreed and anothe r|
yound was ordered. Here Russo's
added weight began to tell, and Wil- |

Indians to build such a waterway.
Had they built it, this canal would
have given them an unbroken water-
way from Quebec, through the Lakes,
down the Hlinois and the Mississippi,
to New Orleans, and would have
aided them greatly in their effort to
hem in the English and confine them
to the Atlantic coastal plain. The
French never built thts canal, But
centuries later the city of Chicago
did build it. We know it todny as
the Chieago drainage canal. An-
other canal that was suggested very
early was the Cape Cod Ship Cans.
This was eventually built about 1914.

In a brief period, Dr. Theiss sald,
America built 4400 miles of canals,
at what was then a tremendous cost,
and within much less than a century
scrapped the entire system. Yet the
investment, he said, was probably
one of the best investments this na-
tion ever maile, for the canals con-
solidated two parts of the nation that
were rapidly falling apart, and play-
ed what wns probably the deciding
part in settling the question of. nu-
tional) unity.

Bucknell will meet an experienced
team in Colgate. “Cy” Sullivan, a
guard, captains the visiting five. Sul-
livan played an end position on Col-
gate’s great grid machine this fall

Two other Colgate grid stars will
also be in the lineup in “Tommy”
Dowler and “Johnny” Orsi. Dowler
wil! be remembered as the back who
ran Clark Hinkle such a tight race
last year for Eastern high scoring
honors. Orsi is an end on the var-
eity squad. Dowler will be a for-
ward and Orsi will do the tap-otf
honors Friday night.

Nichols at Guard

“Ray” Nichols will probably be at
the other guard position with Cap-
tain Sullivan. Nichols is also a base-
ball letterman. Harold Anderson,
the remaining member of the quin-
tet, will team with Dowler up front.

Bucknell will regain much of the
scoring power it so sadly missed on
the New York trip, with the return
of “Steam” Chenoweth, the sharp
shooting forward. Chenoweth will
be ready to go full speed against
Colgate.

Captain “Norm” Ross will be, at
the other forward berth when the
two teams lineup. “Bill” Smith,
lanky sophomore, will be at center
again. Smith ts a good shot, but has
some faults in footwork which Coach
John D. Plant is trying to iron out.

“Jim” Logan and “Bob” Hepler

for Bucknell, although Hepler may
be foreed to lo bench duty because of
a bad knee.

Hepler played a great floor game
on the New York trip, being particu-
larly brilliant at the Army where he
gave a great exhibition in handling
the ball. If Hepler is unable to play,
“Cy” Marter, football captain-elect,

Prof.C.M.Bond Writes

For“ Intercollegian”

‘Article On Christian Movement
In College Written By
B. U. Professor

In the January issue of The Inter-
collegian appears an article on the
place of the Student Christian Move-
ment in the life of the college stu-
dent and faculty member, written by
Professor Charles M. Bond.

Professor Bond calls his article “A
Cooperative Quest.” In it, he speaks
of Bucknell’s Y. M. C. A. as ‘a defi-
nite forum for the sharing of relig-
jous experience, and a field for active
participation in activities tending to
release and direct forces which give
promise of achieving character.”
This is Professor Bond’s idea of the
way a Y. M. C. A. should supplement
college classes in carrying out one of
the main purposes of the modern
educational process, that of building
character.

The Association gives a chance for
an exchange of ideas by faculty
members and students. An attempt
can be made to evaluate calmly and
frankly those conflicting view points
of youth and age, the one often un-
developed, the other biased.

Thus the Student Christian Move-
ment, which includes the Y. M. C. A.,
the Y. W. C. A., the Student Volun-
teer Movement and the denomina-
tional groups, becomes ai “joint
stake” and a “cooperative quest” in
which the faculty member is given
an opportunity to join hands, hearts,
and minds with youth in a common
quest for the realization of the life
of God in men.

REGISTRATION HOUR
CARDS REQUIRED

Cards for admission to the gym-
nasium for enrollment days next se-
mester must be secured at the Reg-
istrar’s office tomorrow or Saturday.
Science students will register Mon-
day afternoon, and Arts students
Tuesday forenoon and afternoon.

Students are warned that arrange-
ments for deferred payment of the
second semester bill must be made
at the Registrar's office tomorrow or
Saturday, and not at the time of
enrollment as formerly. Bucknell
is one of the few colleges at the
present time that will accept defered

yment of student accounts, accord-
ng to Registrar Holter, and the stu-
dents are urged to facilitate the work
of handling these accounts as much
as possible,

Comprehensive Exams Will Test
Student As Well As Course;
To Encourage Study

One of the most serious enterprises |
ever attempted in making Bucknell
a pioneer among the great American
universities will be formally insti-
tuted by Dr. Harry W. Robbins next |
semester. ‘Using the results of our
recent Carnegie and other examina-
tions as a basis,” said Dr. Robbins,
“we are putting Bucknell in line with
Swarthmore and a few other univer-
sities in getting away from the pi-
geon-hole type of examination to a
more accumulative, a more compre-
hensive one.”

“We are following one of the most
recent trends in educational opinion,
that examinations should be tests of |
the student rather than of his course,
tests of what he has learned him-
self as well as what he has learned |
in class. However, the adoption of
comprehensive examinations is to en-
courage students to do more work, |
not penalize them tf they don’t. For
instance, if a student who has been
making 100 percent in his studies
‘flunks’ the examination, only 1242
percent will be subtracted. Those)
who just barely fail to pass will have
only about four or five pereent sub-
tracted. In short, the worst such |
examinations will do ordinartly ts to
bring a B plus down to a B, a C to |
a D plus.”

Will Require Three Years

Tt will take three years to put the |
entire system into effect. Next se-
mester, it will apply to the students
taking English 152 and 154. The
freshmen will be exatnined upon|
their first semesier’s work as well a
that of their second. The freshmen
taking journalism will be examined
in that subject also. The sophomores
will have questions on freshmen rhet-
oric, and those who have studied
American literature or advanced ex-
position will have additional ques-
tions. There will be only 200 ques-
tions in all. Thus, the more courses
a student has taken,the lesser number
of questions he will have upon each
one. Each student will have a sep-
arate examination based upon
present and past courses.

“The discussion of this proposal,”
continued Dr. Robbins, “brought out
the differences between ours and tne
other departments.”” If a student is
taking advanced chemistry, he must
remember his  elémentary work.
Whereas in English, except for the
rudiments of composition, this isn’t
true. For one can study Shakespeare
and make little use of hts study of
Chaucer. One can study modern lit-
erature and make comparatively
little use of his study of Shakespeare.
History and the social science are
the same way. It is expected that |
these departments will adopt a sys-
tem similar to ours, if ours proves
successful.

WJBU Returns to Air;
Commercial Program
Periods Available

|FAULTY TRANSMITTER

CAUSES SHUTDOWN

Regular broadcasts have been re-
sumed over WJBU. The first regu-
lar program was given Monday at
12:30 noon, that time being given
over to the Strand theater of Sun-
bury. A faulty transmitter has
caused a partial shutdown for two
or three days, but this trouble will
soon be eliminated by the technic-

ans.

Plans for operating WJBU as a
commercial station have been carried
out to some extent, but there are
several remaining program periods
that may be obtained by advertisers.
The firms so far contracted are: the

Strand theater, of Sunbury; the Peer- |
J. F.

less Launiry, of Lewisburg; J.
Reber & Co., of Lewisburg; L. H.
Donehower, of Lewisburg; The Lew-
isburg National Bank; Headings
Drug Store; and Wagner’s Grocery.

Advertisers have expressed them-
selves as being well pleased with the
talent available for their programs.
There is.an opportunity open for any
student or groups of students who
have a good program to offer.

Program director, George R. Faint,
has been kept busy arranging the
new program and does not yet have
it completed for next week. As soon
as he has finished it, copies will be
placed in various places about Lew-
isburg, and some will be sent ott
through the mail.

Prominent Theologian

Prior to his visit to Bucknell late
in February, Mr. Curry will lead the
third annual Midwinter Conference
of the Middle Atlantic Dtstrict Field
Council to be held at the Buck Hill
Falls, February 6-8. Eleven Buck-
nell men are scheduled to attend the
conference.

Mr. Curry, who is connected with
the Union Theological Seminary in

ed by two Bucknell students under
the direction of the department of
political science. The students are

| Walter R. Moore, '30, now a grailuate

student, and Marie Groff, '33.

These students have been working
in conjunction with Professor Har-
wood L. Childs, head of the depart-
ment, to gather data on the volume
and kind of crime in Williamsport;
the cost of police, prosecution; and
penal and corrective treatment. Co-
operating with them are the officials
of Williamsport. They have put at
the disposal of the department, cen-
sus reports which can be used in
compiling data on racial composition,
industrial conditions, age, sex, dis-
tribution of population, educational
factors, and wealth, with the idea of
relating all these to the cost of ad-
ministering justice.

Aim to Divide Cost

One of the chief aims of the study
will be to divide the costs of courts
and police between civil cases and
criminal cases.

Professor Childs has announced
that the work will not be completed
before March 1, and that no report
will be given out at Bucknell, but
will be submitted direct to Sidney P.
Simpson of New York, special direc-
tor {n charge of the investigation on
the costs of enforcement.

the University and in the work of
Dr. (Hunt in particular. :

In the first letter in the collection
Dr. Roth writes:

“This bouquet of letters was gath-

gratitude for the soul of a master-
teacher. It is the result of casual
remarks to friends, to boys and girls,
to students of Bucknell University,
and to members of St. Andrew

It is offered to you as a symbol,
also, of the unspoken word of thou-|

Wyoming Seminary
Quintet To Meet
Baby Bisons Here

Tustin Gymnasium To Be Scene
Of Battle On Afternoon
Of February 6

Wyoming Seminary is the next
obstacle to be brushed aside—at least
so figure the Bucknell freshmen.
With one victory safely stowed away,
and a close two point loss behind
them, they’re loaded for Wyoming
Sem. The game will be played in
Tustin gymnasium the afternoon of
February 6.

Coach “Mal” Musser has_ shifted
his men around to find the right
combination, but is having difficulty
because the race for positions is very
close.

“Bob” Fisher, ‘Eddie’ Meyers,
and “Jack” Jett seem the best of the
forward candidates, “Del” Vaughn,
and “Newt” Ruch form a pair of de-
pendable guarding and shooting de-
fense men, “Jeff” James with his
height, passing, and shooting should
be very valuable at center. Musser
will depend on these six men to take
over the Kingston Seminary boys.

The frosh are drilling daily against
the varsity and should be in good
shape for their old rivals.

CAP AND DAGGER WILL
PRESENT “CRAIG’S WIFE”

The first play of the season to be
sponsored individually by Cap and
Dagger will be “Craig's Wife,” the
cast for which is now being asscm-
bled. The present plan is to give
two performances of the drama.

Arthur L. Randall, ’32, will be the
student director. “Craig's Wife,” a
comedy by George Kelly, is scheduled
to go on the boards March 19 and 20
in the Lewisburg High School audi-
torium. ©

COLLEGIANS, AWAKE!

This morning the papers carried 1
dispatch from Spain relating to stu-
dent. distrubances there in connection
with the revolution. The students of
the University of Granada are re-

ported to have caused some damage |

to property in an effort to make their
sentiments on the subject clear.

Who ever heard of American stu-
dents taking an attitude favoring or
opposing any national or interna-
tional event? Absorbed in campu
netivities, they
to the higher-ups.

There ave two major conceptions
of college life current in the outside
world. Hollywood has given us the
reputation of whoopee institution
and marriage factories But ther
ire still some trusting souls who
envision college as the haunt of those
who seek an education, The enroll
ment any college includes types
answering to both deseriptions. Hut
hoth types upon graduation are t
pected to take the responsible pos
ons that must be filled in nationa

A POINT SYSTEM:

as been pointed out in th
eral times that Buckne
usly over-organized, that st
dent ‘nter too many extra-curricu
lar activitic nee there is no limit
to the number in which they may
ngage. It been suggested that
Senior Council is the logical body to
levise some system whereby a stu
dent could be kept from taking upon |
himself the burden of too many ex-
tra-curricular duties which leave him
with no time for study.

The problem is not a local one,
Other colleges have met the same sit
uation and have faced it squarely.
The same solution will not work in
every case, but we feel certain that
our problem can and must be solved.
George Washington University has
settled upon a system which is not
without its merits. The Hatchet,
George Washington weekly, discusses
the innovation in the following edi-
torial, labeled “The Point System”:

A long-felt need of this Univers-
ity, a plan which has proven Its
vorth in a majority of the colleges
throughout the country, has at last
bwon adopted by the Student Council,
to take effect at the opening of the
all term of 1931.

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL. UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PEN:

| As it is now, a student may have a
committee meeting at noon, a sport
in the afternoon, and organization
} meetings two'or three nights in the
week. As a result study is accom-
plished in between, or whenever there
jis nothing else to do.

The adoption of the point sys- -
tem will mean that the people
who hold executlve positions will
he, better able to carry the re-
sponsibility than if they hid sev-
eral jobs to divide their time be-
tween. There is always someone
who can fulfill the various open-
ings in activities, and candidates
will tend to contest for positions
better suited to their talents and
| capabilities rather than every op-

portunity that may present if-

self. |

The Student Council will welcome |
uny suggestions or criticisms ca

the student body may wish to make.

MACHINE
Man-made mammoth!
Murmuring mass of
Gyrating wheels and
Gesticulating pistons!
Appeaser of the palpitating
Pulse of despatch!
Profound paradox!
Thou art a meek,
Obsequious servant;
Thou art a haughty ruler
A heartless usurper
Yet, withal,
Soul-less, mind-less, and will-less?
Unfailing performer!
Unvacilating vehicle,
Carrying out every order
Of man, thy master!
Child of Labor and Laziness,
Thy ready submission and
Mild, complacent compliance
Are disgusting.
Thou art naught
But duty's
Terrible tyrant!
Thy imperturbablc
Has grappled, octopus-like,
The unsuspecting seu! of man
And blinded his sentient sight
Which beheld beauty
In ethereal qualities and
In ecstatic nature.
Thou hast foreed upon him
The callous, sciolistic
Seales of rigid, practical values:
Snatched from him
The joy that he once had
In letting his pent soul
Namble in the rapturous realms
Of Nature’s great poetical uneven-
ness.
Brute beast of burden,
Thou hast made
Slave of thy master!

Larry. At the close of his sopho-
more year at Lafayette, Larry
Foster went to spend the summer,
on a ranch in Arizona. There, in
the midst of the rugged life which
he came to love, he met with a
fatal accident. The book ‘Larry,”
is a collection of diary jottings,
letters, English theres, and po-
etry, which were gathered after
his death by those who had been
inspired by his life.

Jt is an unusun! yolume, that pro-
vides a fascinating story of a red-
blooded college boy. The com-
ments upon athletics, fraternities,
girls, professors, and religion were

_made without any thought of their
being published and, therefore are
frank. The book’s vitality comes
from the fact that it is built upon
the everyday experiences of 1 mod-
ern collegian. It is possible to
criticize Larry for a certain nai-
vete, but only if one is unaware
of what college students really dare,
The thing you will like most about
Larry’s writings, is his faculty for
searching into the core of things.

“Larry” is enjoying a wide read-
ing on our campus. The review-
er’s copy has been read hy ten

TRRPOLILLI'S POST
ON BOXING TEAM

‘125-Pound Freshman ‘Moving

Down Into Flyweight Class
For Catholic U. Bout

COHEN IS IMPROVING
IN 115-POUND CLASS

The opening” announcement of the
bouts with Catholic University, Feb-
ruary 14, may surprise Bucknell ring
followers, for Jackie Kielb, freshman
boxer, may usurp the place of “Jim”
Terpolilli, who represented Bucknell
in the 115-pound class last winter.

Kielb fought “Mickey” Boerner in
the inter-class bouts a few days ago,
and was soundly thrashed, but the
Plainfield yearling showed lots of
fight and a good punch in either
yand. After a workout the other}
day, Kielb stepped on the scales to
find he had come down to 121 pounds.

The youngster did a lot of think-
ing. There is “Mickey” Boerner, a
very clever and husky 125 pounder
ahead, and the lower division is only
two pounds away. {f Kielb can make
119 pounds, he will be given a chance
to show his wares against Terpolilli,
who came out of the inter-class bouts
successfully.

In the meantime Alex Cohen isn't

altogether out of the running, for he |

picks up and makes use of advice
quickly.
it seems, is still in a muddle. Buck-
nell has been weak in the division.
Competition is becoming keener. Out
of it all, under Coach Joe Reno's
guidance, may come « consistent win-
ner in the 115-pound division.

GEORGE BEALE,'25,
APPOINTED HEAD
OF U.P. BUREAU

Transferred From Los Angeles
To San Francisco Post

George H. Beale, '25, who was
managing editor of the Bucknellian
in 1924, has just been appointed act-
ing manager of the United Press day
bureau at San Francisco. Before
going to San Francisco he was as
sistant office manager of the [as
Angeles bureau of the U. P.

Leale’s start in the newspaper
world came when he got « job on the
Vittsburgh Sun about six weeks after
his graduation from Bucknell. His
first experiences were in getting
photographs for his paper to print,
and in rewriting news stories. His
experiences should be of interest to
prospective Bucknell! journalists.
They are best told In his own words
so we'll let George do it. Here are
some of the things he wrote Pro-
fessor Lewis Theiss, soon after he
got his first job:

BABY BISONS LOSE

QUINTET, 44-42

“Del” Vaughn Stars For Frosh}

Courtsters, Tallying
Fourteen Points

The Bucknell freshman team was
nosed out by the Phi Beta Lambidas
of Sunbury in a snappy clash last
Thursday night, 44-42. Miller was
the outstanding shot for the Phi!
Betas accounting for 22 out of his
teain’s total of 44. Vaughn upheld
the scoring end of the frosh by tal-
lying 14 of his team’s points.

Vaughn led off for the freshmen
with a long field goal. Miller drop-
ped a foul shot; then Meyers and
2uch each added two points. In the
next two minutes, Hepler and Miller,
Sunbury aces, counted five points to
tie the score. The Sunbury boys
then jumped ahead for a short space,
but a barrage of field goals by the
frosh, which was started by Vaughn
snd Meyers, placed the Baby Bisons
in the lead 27-21. This six-point
lead was held until the half.

The third quarter showed the frosh
in a slump, while the Phi Betas, tak-
ing advantage, ran up a score of
114-1 in that period of play. Not
daunted by this seven point lead, the
|frosh staged a rally in the fourth
‘ quarter and with six minutes to play,
tied the score, 37-37. With one min-
j ute to go the chances were still even,
42-42. And then, 15 seconds before
the final whislte, Hepler dropped one
from under the basket and the game
ended 44-42 for the Phi Beta Lamb-
das.

DR. L. B. THEISS
GIVES TWO TALKS
ON U.S. DIRIGIBLES

Professor Describes Manner
Of Construction Of
Navy Airships

SPEAKS TO MEETING OF
L'BURG LIONS CLUB

Dr. Lewis K. Theiss, professor of
journalism, talked to both the Lewis-
burg Lions Club and the Lewisburg
high school, on Monday and Wed-
nesday respectively, about Uncle
Sam’s dirigibles.

To give his audiences an idea of
the huge size of the Navy's dirigibles,
the Los Angeles and the ill-fated
Shenandoah, which was wrecked in
Ohio in a line storm, the speaker said
that both of these ships were sp-
proximately 200 yards long which is
twice as long as Old Main, plus 20
feet. In thickness the Los Angeles
js 90 feet—easily twice as_ thick
through as the wings of Old Main
are high.

Professor Theiss described the dur-
alumin structure of these ships, and
displayed photographs that showed
their structure. He also had a pic-
ture of the frame of one of the new
Navy dirigibles now building at
Akron, Ohio, which will be 65 feet
longer than the Los Angeles and
much larger in diameter.

Exhibits Specimen

Exhibiting specimens of the fine}
fabric used for making gas cells, and
of the gold-beaters’ skin which is in.

Theiss described the actual process
of building up this laminated gas

themselves.

tightly-woven cotton made
long panels, with eyelets along the
re-enforced edges, so the various
panels can be hooked together. Over
the seams strips of fabric are glued
fast, and the exterior of the ship is
given a coating of aeetate dope,
which shrinks the fabric tight over
the frame.
The talk closed with the display of
an artist's drawing, picturing a giint
dirigible attached to the mooring
mast atop the new Empire State

TALKS IN MILTON
TO WOMEN’S CLUB

Professor Harwood 'L. Childs, head
of the department of political science,
talked to the Women’s Club of Mil-
ton on “The Insignificant Citizen,”
Monday evening.

The insignificant citizen is one who
goes to the polls, casts his vote, and
then forgets all about politics until
the next election, according to Prof.
Childs. The average citizen is a
man who has little influence on the
government, and to whom, with the
inerease in population, will come a
lessening of even this small influence.

Another reason for the decrease tn
the contro! of the average citizen,
cited by Prof. Childs, is the fact that
so many functions have come under
government control. Then, too, this
is an age of propaganda, and the
citizens are ruled by it.

logical, and journalism courses offer-
ed here. The location of the uni-
versity, its proximity to many of the
students’ homes, its size (which
identifies it as the popular “small
college” in comparison with the
latger universities), and acquaint-
ance with alumni were also recorded
as reasons.

One sports enthuiast confessed
that Bucknell's football team attract-
ed him to the university. A_finan-
cially-minded genius stated that the
opportunity for earning money in
part time work brought him to this
eampus. A mustcally inclined stu-
dent wrote that he found this uni-

Replies like “I don’t know” and

Women Prefer Dance
To Any Other Form
Of Physical Exercise

Dancing would seem to be the most
popular form of physical exercise,
since one half of the classes, for
which over 175 co-eds registered on
Wednesday, offer dancing in one
form or another.

Of the ten gym classes, five will be
levoted to dancing. There is one
class of clogging for freshmen, two
classes of tap dancing for sopho-
mores, and two classes of natural
dancing.

A new type of gymnasium work is
being introduced here. There is a
elass of Danish gym, which sub-
seribes to the European ideal of
formal training and is devoted to
arm exercises.

Basketball and work on the appar-
atus will be given this year again as
usual. A course will also be given
in playground and kindergarten
work. Later on in the spring, classes
in tennis and archery will be offered.
No credit will be given for golf this’

to Bucknell in 1915 he had business
experience in several leading hotels
in Kansas City. The College Inn
during these six years was leased and
operated successfully by several stu-
dents.

Upon his return, Mr. Payne re-
placed the little shack with a larger
and more substantial brick cottage.
The new place of business consisted
of five rooms-—a living-reom and bed-
room at the rear right, foyntain and |
lunch counter at the front right, a
kitchen at the rear left, and a pantry |
running out through thé middle as
far as the fountain, which occupied
its present location.

Built Present Inn in 1923

The up-to-date establishment tha
the College Inn is today was created
in 1923 by building around and over
the brick cottage. When it was fin-
jshed, the new home consisted of
forty rooms, including four com tote |
apartments and four lines of busi-
ness—tallor shop, barber shop, sta-
<ionery store, and cafeteria.

The tailor shop was operated in its
present location by Ray Farley as
agent for John Prowant until 1927.|
Then “Al” Brushwiller from Indian-
apolis leased the plant from Mr.
Payne. Under his management the
tailor shop has become a live and
successful business. To help him
take care of the rushes that come &
few days preceding every large all-
college or fraternity dance, Mr.
Brushwiller recently installed a
second pressing machine.

ginning in 1924 in a downstairs room

outfitted to care for the football

ANNE M. VANDINE, '26,
MARRIES IN BRAZIL

Miss Anne Margaret VanDine, '26,
was recently married in Rio de Ja-
neiro, Brazil, to James Cameron Mac-
Intyre, formerly of Glasgow. The
ceremony was performed in the Eng-
lish church there.

Miss VanDine has been teaching at
Mackenzie College in Brazil since
October 1929. Before going there,
she was a teacher in the Southern
Junior high school in Reading.

While at Bucknell, Miss VanDine
was very active in extra-curricular
activities, being a member of the
Kent Pre-legal Club, of the Women’s
Student Executive Board, of the
Freshman Commission, and of the
Women’s Glee Club. She was vice
president of the Y. M. C. A. in her
junior year and played hockey her
first two years.

Home of Professors
During the few years of its exist-

ence, the College Inn has been the|

home of many men who have been
prominent on the campus. Among
these are Prof. Frederick Lund, the
former head of our psychology de-

| partment, who with his wife occupied

an apartment on the third floor.
“Al” Stoughton, alumni secretary,
lived in another of the four apart-
ments for five years. At the pres-
ent time Prof. and Mrs. H. S. Robin-
son are inhabitants of the Inn.

The College Inn has helped scores
of students through Bucknell by giv-
ing them employment and by fur-
nishing them rooms at a minimum
rental. It has trained many men
who later became caterers for fra- |
ternities. A great many of its |
former employees have become
prominent in college politics. At!
least one of our teachers, instructor |
Ralph F. Hartz of the Music School, |
was a former employee of the Inn
having worked for Guy Payne four
years while he was a stndent at
Bucknell.

To Bucknell graduates of the past
score of years, the College Inn has
seemed like an integral part of Buck-
nell. Every student in those years}
has frequented the Inn. Many are}
the banquets, formal and informal,
that have been held by Bucknell stu-
dents within its walls. Many are the |

happy memories of hours spent inj!

this cheerful eating house that Buck-
nell graduates have carried out into
the world with them. And all who
have patronized the Inn have taken
away with them kindly remem-
brances of the smiling, white-coated
proprietor with the generous heart,
whose pluck and perseverence built
up this fine institution. Probably,
among all the eating places at Amer-
jean schools, it is the only college inn
that was born in a peddler's basket.

tercollegiate athletics, for which, all
hail the U. of P.!’ That such action
should come from a large university
was the surprise factor; it was not
surprising that the move came at all,
for athletics have long had enough
rope and the climax was bound to
come sooner or later. ’

One of the first matters for Buck-
nell’s yet-unnamed new president to
consider will be the advisibility of
steering Bucknell in the U. of P's.
course. We believe Penn struck out
on the right path, and if Bucknell is
not to be the football dormitory on
the bluff that she denies being, then
Penn’s way is the best way. But let
Bucknell begin the step soon, so that
she does not have to make the radi-
cal change Penn found necessary.

That Bucknell has comparatively
few alumni to complain at the rein-
ing in of intercollegiate athletics is
a factor in her favor, The majority
of the student body, here because
Bucknell is an edueational institution,
will not raise the wail when athletics
are set firmly in their places—the
howling will be well taken eare of
the O. G’s., and we don't mean Old
Golds.

If any readers of this column, I
hope it is not too presumptuous to
assume that I have readers, were
disappointed last week when it did
not appear, I have an explanation to
offer that will satisfy them all, i. e.,
both.

Upon my arrival at the establish-

noon—a time when confusion is

ing and editorial rooms, | was dumb-
Guided by a note saying
something about the
breaking down, I hastened to the
plant of the Lewisburg Journal.
There everyone looked blank when I
mentioned "Bucknellian,” but finally
an underling confessed that it had
been there but left. So back again
to the established office. No result.
And another trip to the Journal. An

it was being quietly folded up and

age is irreparable, even if the tn- |
mates do turn out to be a nice, re- |

naine can be prevented by a few
strokes of your pencil. Agree on a
good name for the house of incarcer-

divoree Lewisburg from it. |

This being the first issue of the

we have a select list of members of
the faculty after whom we would}

They Had Their Fun

Down at Muhlenberg the students
are bemoaning the advantages of the
former system of exams, which has
just been abolished. It seems that
the registrar played a low trick on
the Muhlenbergers by introducing
numbered, marked, colored, and
otherwise foolproof quiz sheets this
year. He also announced that smok-
ing during exams is henceforth ta-
boo. ’

Alumni in their day used to rejoice
in a system in which was included the
ritual of smoking, walking to the
window to throw out the stub, mean-
while dropping appeals for aid to
those who waited below. Immediate-
ly after special delivery letters would
be delivered and everybody passed
exams.

Michigan State co-eds will be al-

comes as a result of concerted effort

HORTICULTURE

The woodmen that recently have
been sparing no trees on the campus
have been doing a commendable job,
if we who know little or nothing
about forestry may express our opin-
ion, We do know, however, that
lead wood has no place on a_ live
tree, and that all living thing
flourish better when given a little at-
tention—our erudition is impressive,
you see. But we like to see the cam-
pus being made ready for spring—
quite in keeping with the start of a
new semester, and all that.

The dead wood the foresters have
not dealt with was well taken care
of by the faculty after the finals—
another excellent job, according to
the breaths of rumors that escape
under the door of the recorder’s of-
fice.

However, there is still some prun-
ing to be done here. Certain courses
that have withered with age - still
stand out on Bucknell’s curriculum
lanscape, serving no purpose, but
merely marring the harmony.
subjects have unsuccessfully been
grafted on some courses and = are
neither as beautiful nor as productive
as they should be. We fully expect
to wake up some bright morning and
find the faculty curriculum commit-
tee slashing vigorously here and
gnipping judiciously there, consulting
from time to time that handy pulde
to ecurricula-culture, Flexner’s ‘Uni-
versities, American, English, Ger-
man.” There are few events that
we would applaud more heartily.

FOLLOWING PA PENN

A courageous move was that of the
University of Pennsylvania in put-
ting big, bad boy athletics in his
proper place. A part of this step
was to make the coaches members of
the facluty, with faculty salaries.
Others, just as unconventional, were
te abolish training tables, to de away
with out-of-season practices, and to
outline a broad program of intra-
mural sports.

All this cannot help but Jessen the
much-deplored over-emphasis on in-

Other |

gard that suggestion. |

The prison being in Union county,
how about calling it “Union prison,”
after that grand, old, historic person-
age, A. Federated Union? That
would be as innocuous as any, and
would hurt the feelings of no one—
unless he wishes his own name to go
down to posterity. So why not

“Union prison?”

Personal Opinion

ons to state my position the

question of religion.

I suppose I should he classed as an
ntransigeant. As a matter of facet,
I covet for Bucknell the serious con-
sideration of many issues which con-
front the American mind today.
Among many issues just as funda-
mental, I should like to stimulate
serious discussion on the question of |
religious reality. Although serving |
in a enpacity here on the campus
which neither is nor ought to be
| designated religious, I have never-
theless thrown my hat in the ring as
one who js willing to face the prac-
tical issues of religion on the cam-
pus. JI have no idea of withdrawing
my interest in these matters.
Speaking objectively, it would seem
|that any dynamic approach to the
problem of religion on the campus
would be’ a rather radical departure
from the conventional mind of the
eampus. The conventional] religious
mind is a cynical, griping, fear-rid-
| den mind. The critical, searching,
| appreciative, and practical mind lies
dormant, while the negative and

lot of English majors are willing and
eager to purchase essays and short
stories at very substantial prices.

MISC.

A blow to any intellectual prowess
Bucknell may claim was delivered by
the professor who dealt out only
eight (8) A’s among his 200 or more
students. Gulliver is, glad to see
some prof has finally crashed
through with the Lowdown on the
student body.

Gulliver would like to know what
the committee that was probing stu-
dent-faculty relations here found out.

The letter, unsigned, ends,|) the same manner as
“If you do this (open a column),|legiate meet heneeforth.

|

Were there any relations, or were |

there only the kind we never bring
out of the closet until after the
honeymoon ?

And here’s the true story of Buck-
nell’s first absent-minded professor.
At the time when the incident oc-
turred, he had a small daughter, not
yet out of the baby carriage stage.
One sunny afternoon he wheeled the
infant downtown, parking the car-
riage in front of the postoffice. (The
postoffice was not in the same loca-
tion as now, just by way of explana-
tion). After transacting certain
businesses, he left by the side door
and went to the book store, then
owned by the late Dr. Heim. Some
time was passed there, and it grew
so late that he had to hurry home for
supper. :

He had removed his hat and coat
when his wife asked where baby was.
Consternation swept over the poor
man, and with a thousand misgivings
he raced to the postoffiee, and there
baby was, protesting loudly at her
desertion. One story has it that she
was wearing dark glasses and had
collected quite a bit of change in her
bonnet, but this version is to be dis-
counted, —GULLIVER.

ee

| cynical level of thought flashes in
| spasmodic wise-cracks about a sub-
ject of enduring interest. The em-
pirical data of the history of religion
which is both momentous and con-
tinuous, at least deserves the respect-
ful consideration of intelligent stu-
dents. Only the shallow and super-
ficial mind will ignore it.

If one wants me to admit that we
need a better technique and a more
vital approach to religion here on
the campus, I am agreed; but that
religion ought to be discarded al-
together, or that it is a phenomenon
which will efther foster or permit of
cheap wit or unholy indifference, any
more than it will permit of a weak
presentation and interpretation, or
allow an antiquated form and con-
tent, 1 am neither agreed nor pas-
sive.

Sincerely,
J. Hillis Miller,

| AMONG THE BOOK STALLS '

Dover neperooeanccsersneesponeeT

Here are reviews of those books
which are new additions to the li-

brary:

Jews Without Money is unreservedly
recommended as a “must.” Au-
thor Michael Gold has revived with
rare vividness the horrors, the

in, the drudgery, and the squal-

lor of life on New York’s East

Side. It is mostly a picture of
those immigrants ~ a are lured to
‘this land of prosperity,” al to
be swallowed in a tiny world of
pimps, tenements, scarlet sisters,
and gangsters. Here, it is hard
for even a Jew to make money. If
you disillusion easily, don’t read
this till after the depression.

The .Virgin and the Gypsy is a novel
taken from the‘ unfinished imanu-
seript of D, H. Lawrenee, who died
a year ago. Despite all of its de-
tached skill of characterization,
beauty, lucidity, and originality it
is nothing more than the bare
skeleton of a novel. The ending is
so abrupt that one feels certain
Lawrence would have made it more
elaborate and inclusive. This un-
usual story is told with all of the
beautiful and uneanny symbolism
that is characteristic of the author’s
earlier works. A girl at variance
with her family, and a gypsy whom
she loves, are forced into contact
with one another when they are
trapped by a flood. But their love
is as abrupt as the novel itself.

A small cloth-bound volume, which
has been a forgotten tenant of the
library archives for a good many
years, has just been diseovered.
Miss Eliza Martin, librarian, rates
its importanee high not only be-
cause it is a very early argument
against slavery, but because the
signature of that great anti-slavery
agitator, William Lloyd Garrison,
is displayed on the fly leaf.

The book, titled “Lectures Upon
Slavery and its Remedy.” was
written in 1832, by Amos A.
Phelps, and the publication was
made in Boston under the auspices
of the New England Anti-Slavery
Society. For students of the ques-
tion of slavery, this volume will
prove valuable. In speaking of
the book at the time of its print-
ing. Mr. Garrison said “that it
elucidated the nature of slavery,
and the duty of immediate emanci-
pation, in a manner so masterly as

Miss Jackson's wide experience has
included teaching, particularly in
summer schools like that of the Uni-

Jay Henry Stahl, ’33, who narrow: |

Following the accident, Stahl .was
taken to the Ziegler Infirmary, and
later removed to the Williamsport
Private Hospital, where he was con-
fined for five weeks. At the hos-
pital, it was found that Stahl had
eighteen fractures. So serious were
his injuries that his feet could not
be set for two weeks, and his jaws
were wired for six weeks.

After leaving the hospital, Stahl
remained at his home until October,

Tasker Bliss Called
Soldier - Philologist in
Amer. Legion Monthly

General Tasker H. Bliss, ex-°73, ac-
cording to that noted writer, Fred-
erick Palmer, was the “best educated
soldier in the American Army.” Mr.
Palmer sets forth'this idea in a series
of articles now being published by
the American Legion Monthly.

The reasons for Mr, Palmer's se-
lection are that General Bliss was an
adept lingujst, having a thorough
understanding of French, German,
and Spanish. He could read ancient
Latin and Greek and often did so for
a pastime. Bliss had the rare sus-
taining mental power to work six-
deen hours a day, which so many
able men found that they lacked.

One story, which bears out Mr.
Palmers statement, is that while
General Bliss was a represeritative on
the Supreme War council ‘he was the
only man among a group of eminent
European statesmen and scholars
who could read a Latin inscription on
a wall. Because of his great knowl-
elge General Bliss was secretary
Baker’s chief aid during the recent
war.

Vedas Hymns Subject rv
Ot World Lit. Lecture

. The Vedas hymns, probably the
earliest Indo-European literature that
we have, will be discussed tonight by
Professor Leo Rockwell as the first
lecture for the second semester of
the World Literature course.

These Indo-European hymns are
representative of the true early lit-
erature and religious thought of that
people. The Bible and similar liter-
ature, that we have been accustomed
to ‘consider a part ‘of the heritage
left us by our forebears, is in reality,
borrowed from the Semitic peoples.

The Vedas hymns are particularly
representative of the religious
thought of the times—polytheism.
The ‘Hebrews were the race who
evolved monotheism and handed it on
to us. There is, nevertheless, in
these hymns, a feeling that the many
spirits are representative of a single
divine being.

Professor Roekwell will outline the
migrations of the people who wrote
the hymns, and he will give readings
from the Rigueda, generally consid-
ered the most important of
hymns

“Ole Bull,” Norwegian Violinist,
Figures in Bloomsburgian’s
Tales of Settlers

MANY GUESTS ATTEND

One hundred and fifty
and guests attended the annual guest
meeting of Shikelemo Chapter, D. A.
R., Monday evening in the living-
room of the new dormitory. Twen-
ty-one faculty members of the chap-
ter were hostesses, Mrs. Lewis E.
Theiss, the regent, presided and in-
troduced the guest speaker, the Rev
Harry F. Babcock, of Bloomsburg,
who talked on Ole Bull and his Nor
wegian Colony in Pennsylvania.

Mr. Babcock described Ole Bull as
an idealist, but he added that we owe
debts not always to  hard-heade
practical men, but rather to the
dreamer, some one who has that vis-
ion without which the people would
perish.

Such a man was Ole Bull, the Nor-
wegian violinist, born in 1810 in Ber-
gen, Norway, and dying near there
seventy years later. He was natura!-
ly musical. There still lives at the
foot of Ole Bull’s mountain a man,
Henry Olson, who is a grandson of
one of the original colony. He tald
Mr. Babcock that his father had told
him that Ole Bull could imitate a
bird, an animal, or a human being
perfectly. He repeated the story
that on his violin, Ole Bull would rep-
resent, simultaneously, a cradle rock
ing, a baby crying, and a mothe
singing. And then with his magic
violin the sound of the baby's crying
would cease, the mother’s singing
would die away, and all one could
hear would be the cradle rocking, and
that, too, finally faded away. :

Ole Bull was the last of his gen-
eration of violinists. He was a great
force for patriotism in modern Nor-
way. He songht to keep his country
free from the domination of Sweden.

Miss Charlotte Armstrong, teacher
of violin at the School of Music, ac-
companied by Mrs. W. TT. Mae-
Creadie, played two selections: one,
the second movement from Grieg’:
“Sonata in F Major,” and the other
Ole Bull’s “Shepherd Girl's Sunday.”

PROF. COLESTOCK
GIVES LECTURE
AT. BELLEFONTE

“Best Things of Life Pass from
One Generation to: Another
By Contagion”

‘THEME HIS FAVORITE

“That the best things of life are
not passed from one generation to
another by formal teaching, but are
passed by contagion,” was the themo
of the lecture, “Contagion of Life,”
delivered by Dr, Hl. T. Colestock at
Bellefonte, January 29, before the
Convention of Directors of Center
County.

“Contagion is usually looked at as
something undesirable,” said Dr.
Colestock, “because we think of it

the | along abnormal lines, but looking at |

| it on the other side, we see it as one
of the most beneficient factors in
life. The abnormality of it is only a
drop in the bucket as compared to
the normality.

| “One of the best hopes of the race
is this contagion of life. But just
| what does this mean? It means that
|education, formal education, cannot
| pass on many of the most valuable
| things that life has to give, that
| there are many things that we can-
not get by books, and that these
{things are learned by contagion.

“This contagion of life is a method
| by which some of these things are
passed on to the human race, First
of all, there are manners. Manners
are the lubricant to society, the oil
{to your motor, and one of the finest
assets to life. And manners are
learned by contagion.

Morals Transformed

“And then there are morals. How
incomplete moruls are in books if we
ean’t have honor, truthfulness, loyal-
jty, or patriotism in everyday life?
These are all transformed from one
life to the next by contagion, as are
all the finer and nobler qualities we
desire in our future children afid
grandchildren.

“And thirdly, religious faith is
contagious—not religious creed, but
religious faith, This has always
been so, and will continue to be, in
my judgment. There is good phil-
osophy in the statement, ‘like priests,
like people.’ Religious faith is not
gotten by formal instruction, but by
the sudden and inescapable power of
contagion.”

In conclusion; Dr. Colestock said,
“The most important thing in life is
the radiation of a person as con-
tributing in good manners, approved
morals, and a vital, religious faith.”

This is one of Dr. Colestock’s fav- |

orite topics; he has talked on it for
many years, an while the kernel j:
always the same, he always has
new message to bring to his audi
ences. ‘He says that this speech has
never ben prepared, but that it ha
'“Sust grown.”

scout executive G. M. Hosterman, of
the Susquehanna Valley Council, an-
nounced here today. Its purpose is
to fit college students for positions
as counsellors in boys’ camps and
as scouters for city troops.

The training course, leading tothe
scouter’s key, the equivalent of the
FRagle rank, will be comprised of a
series of two hour sessions, the last
in each season in the out-of-doors.
The cost of enrollment in the course
will be one dollar and fifty cents.

The first course will include the
fundamentals of scoutmastership.
Beginning with troop organization
and the patrol system, the student
seouters, under Mr. Hosterman, will
learn the essentials of the scouting
program from the tenderfoot re-
quirements to the work of the first
| class scouts.

The work of the second course will
consist of more intensive work in
nature study, signalling, first aid,
{and map making. The use of cere-
|mony in scouting and various phases
of public relations work, will com-
| prise the larger part of study during
the advanced sessions.

“TO KNOW HOW TO BE ABASED”

A Tribute to Parental Sacrifices

The poor we always have with us, yet the poor man of
today may have more conveniences and luxuriés than the one
who lived in kings’ palaces of yesterday. Just a matter of
relativity. “Ipso facto,” there is no virtue in being rich or
poor. Wise old Solomon was probably right in seeking a
happy medium. This discussion deals primarily with those
who have been “bumped” in railroad parlance, from the great
middle class in recent times to a lower class economically. It
aims to bring encouragement to those suffering from causes
beyond their control.

The College Inn spokesman omits entirely that perma-
nent class of poor people, sub-normal by reason of chronic
sickness, physical defects, low mentality, and the mongrel off-
spring of poor human stock. It offers no palatives fer drink-
ing, gambling, licentiousness and criminality, the most pro-
lific sources of the permanent poor. For every seed bears,
fruit after its kind; and like the laws of the Medes and Per-
standing in their midst represents the greatest single cause of
sians, it does not change. The survival of the unfit with Mars
poverty. The God of War throws them all on a junk heap of
wrecked humanity, crushes them with a heavy debt, and bids
them make democracy safe for the world. The World War
brought forth one crop a hundred fold; our permanent poor
has greatly increased. Our national and local taxes have in-
creased many fold.

To digress a little, we note, in passing, that ‘“Mustle-
Inny” has found a new method besides war and famine to
keep down the surplus population. Testing the royal bump-
ers and shock absorbers with human beings is a somewhat
popular sport of modern dictators. In due time we will ex-
pect another letter from that corner of the world, stressing
the sin of birth control and the urge to increase and multiply
and replentish the conscript army and the empty pews. Any
old kind of humans that can breed prolifically and perpetuate
the permanent poor will carry out the Divine will according
to some of the Prophets. It’seems that pure stock is only a
matter of importance when it cornes to dogs and swine.

The condition of being poor has many inconveniences
and yet it is not without its good side. In a country like our
own there is an incentive and opportunity to rise to a higher
economic caste. The poor man rich in faith knows that trib-
ulation works patience, and patience, experience, and experi-
ence, hope. And hope makes us unashamed of the faith that
is in him. For the other extreme, who trust in uncertain
riches and who go away sad at the thought of parting from
them, to whom a holy day is synonymous with the wide open
spaces and a Continental Sabbath, such an environment may
be alluring in material comfort and power, yet withal, there is
danger for him who hungers and thirsts after righteousness in
such an enervating atmosphere.

This somewhat lengthy introduction may seem out of
place and yet the permanent poor largely explains why the
great middle class must lower its standard of living. Taxes
and more taxes, unemployment and business depressions,
these are the nightmares of the middle class from which
spring our student body. Those parents who under normal
circumstances find it possible to support their children in col-
lege with pardonable pride, pleasure and more or less sacri-
fice. We extend our congratulations to you who despite dis-
couraging circumstances and an uphill fight that seems almost
futile, with increasing mortgages, and collateral pledged to
the limit, with personal sacrifices that your child will never
find out, despite all these many things regular support still
making its way toward BUCKNELL TOWN.

Yours is no permanent type of hardship. Neither you
nor your parents have sinned. You have physical health and
reputation. You will come back when prosperity reappears.
You will enjoy the sunshine all the more once the clouds have
been dispelled. And through it all, we can learn that man
does not live by bread zlone. All things work together for,
good to you of faith. That generation in college by first~
hand acquaintance with hardship and inconveniences, will
help to battle the great sources of poverty, and thereby help
to steer the ship of industry and prosperity on a more even
keel. :

NEW BOXING RULES |Bisons Meet W. Maryland,
Gettysburg on Local Court

REVEAL 3 RECENT
DRASTIC CHANGES

Referee To Be Sole Judge Of
Winner; Extra Rounds
Are Eliminated

REFEREE NAMES WINNER

When the Inter-collegiate Boxing
Rules Committee met last week they
made the most drastic changes ever
made since the introduction of the
manly art of self-defense into the
college realm. 4

The three principal changes were:
The elimination of judges, giving the
referee sole power to decide the win-
ner of the bout. The fighters may
take this out of the referee’s power
by knocking their man out. The
elimination of the extra round was
another important change. The third
was the reduction of the _ entrants
into the Inter-collegiate Champion-
ships to five schools.

Under the new rules the referee
makes all decisions and decides the
winner. There are no extra rounds,
the bout being declared a draw, if,
at the end of the three rounds, there
is no choice between the men. In
this case the points are split up be-
tween the two teams. There are to
be no more invited teams in the In-
ter-collegiate Championships.

Well-Balanced, Six-Meet Box-
ing Schedule

THREE HOME MEETS

With the signing of Carnegie Tech
for a meet at Lewisburg on March
21, the Bison boxing card is complet-
ed. This is the first year tiat Car-
negie Tech has ever engaged in in-
ter-collegiate boxing competition.
They have developed a good team,
with several football men taking
part.

The agreement calls for a home
and home meeting which means that
the Bison team will meet the Tartans
in Pittsburgh next year. The sign-
ing of this meet gives Bucknell a
very attractive six-game schedule
with three meets at home, and three
in foreign rings. The home attrac-
tions are all good ones with Temple
heading the list as old rivals. This
will make the third invasion of the
Owls to Lewisburg. The Bisons
have won on two oceasions while the
Philadelphians have garnered one
win. i

With the second semester under way
the fraternity basketball league, a
matter of supreme,importance to the
campus Greeks, once morc settles
into the hectie battling which yearly
takes place in old, very old, Tustin
gym.

At*the present time the league
leaders cannot be named as there are
too many teams tied for the top
berths in each league. In League
One the outstanding teams are Theta
Upsilon Omega and the Campus Club.
The game between these two teams
was a thriller with the T. U. O. ag-
gregation finally coming through to
win by the narrow margin of two
points. The Campus Club five was
hampered by a lack of reserve ma-
terial.

With a string of defeats behind

they go up against the strong court

if they expect to come through with

During examination week the men
were at practice in threes and fours,
then during registration the team
was unable to use the gymnasium,
and now, with the heaviest part of

Temple has dropped a_ decision to

Carnegie Tech travels to Lewis-
burg for the season wind-up, and as
little is known about the Carnegie
Tech team, yy is looking for-
ward to seeing them in action.

As the season opening approaches
the interest is growing and this sea-

~ son bids fair-to surpass the previous
three years during which inter-col-
legiate teams have been maintained
at Bucknell. The introduction of a
varsity coach has had a stimulating
effect on the sport, and it now vies
with basketball for the sppremacy
of the winter-sport field.

Basketball For 19 Years

At Wisconsin
.

|

jof college basketball in the Middle
| West,” writes Les Gage in the March
issue of College Humor, “has ex-
pounded his theories of the intricate
short pass and plvot offense at the
University of Wisconsin for nineteen
years, excepting an_ intervening
period of two seasons when he coach-
ed at the University of Missouri.
Meanwell's Wisconsin quintets have
led the Big Ten eight times during
his regime. Only twice has

ion. The record books show two
hundred and ten victories and sixty-
one defeats, not including the two
seasons‘when his Missouri fives out-
classed all other teams in the Valley
conference by winning thirty-four
contests and losing two.

“Paul D. Hinkle, Butler's coach, is
a young man. “Tony,” as he has
always been known Lespen of his
swarthy complexion and Latin char-
acteristics, enjoyed a sparkling ath-
letic career at the University of
Chicago. Butler basketball teams
have won sixty-seven games and lost
fifteen under Hinkle. The Bulldogs
have a just claim to the mythical na-
tional honors in 1929, for they upset
many of the country’s most impres-
sive quintets.

Leads For Five Years

“The University of Arkansas has
predominated the Southwest Confer-
ence in basketball for the past five
years. Charles Bassett’s first re-
sponsibility when he became head
coach of the varsity there last sea-
son was to impress the institution
with the fact that Francis Schmidt's
move to Texas Christian would not
break the string of Arkansas cage
titles. Working with a squad of
rangy men, he developed his own
peculiar style of defense, based on
the retreating man-to-man principle.
The season closed with another first
place plaque on the walls of the
Razorback's traphy room.

“The University of Virginia bas-
ketball team is now playing its first
schedule under a new ceach, Gus
Tebell, a protege of “Doc’ Meanwell.
Tebell was a three sports man at
Wisconsin, engaging in football, base-
ball, and basketball. He was an All-
‘Western end for two years and in
1922. was given an All-American
berth. Jast winter Tebell’s North
Carolina State team won the South-
ern Conference tournament at At-
lanta, and his clever floor guard,
Morris Johnson, was named on Cel-
lege Humor's All-American five.

“Although medicine Is his vocation
and basketball his avocation, Dr. H.
C. Carlson has brought to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh a reputation in
the cage game which will live for
many decades. In his elght years of
coaching Dr. Carlson has won a hun-
dred and seven games and lost forty-
one. His Panthers were undefeated
in 1927-28 and lost only two engage-
ments last season. The Pitt coach
is a scientific fellow. He believes
there is a sixth sense, namely, muscle
projection. Not only does Carlson
teach his boys to exercise this theory,
but has proved its value by the blind-
test. Pitt cagers can actually con-
trol the distance of their shots with-
out sighting the goal.”

Student Religions
Seminar Outline
Is Formulated

Plans Call for Informal Talks
On Religion Problems
By Professors

An outline for the remaining meet-
ings of the Student Religions semi-
nar was formulated at a meeting of
the organization yesterday afternoon.
It is planned to have professors and
various men from off the campus
give informal talks before the group
on different phases of race and re-
ligious discrimination and prejudices.

The students that are taking an ac-
tive part in the work of the seminar
are desirous of having faculty mem-
bers join them in the discussion of
the problems raised. Anyone on the
campus who has or knows of a good |
instance of discrimination or preju-
dice due to racial or religious differ-

field goals chalked up for the K. D. | ences would be doing a service tothe

R’s, in the first half, two were added
to the Sigma Chi score, and the tale
stood 25-12, In the next half the
teams were more evenly balanced
and the score at the end of the game
stood, 46-28,

The second event on the evening's
program was rather disappointing to
the non-fraternity followers. Weak-
ened by the loss of Boyer, who has
been showing up to good advantage
on the varsity, they failed to come |
through in the second half, the
Lambda Chis appropriating 29 points
to the Campus Club’s 7. Borella
snared the majority of the Lambda
Chi’s baskets, turning in a total of 17
potnts. Captain DiPace played his
usual steady game, but could do
nothing against the air-tight defense

seminar by reporting such an in-
stance to them.

From next week until the end of
the semester there will be a meeting
of the religious seminars every Fri-
day afternoon at 4:15 in the play
room of the new dormitory. At these
meetings there will be, besides the
informal talks, frank and open dis-
cussions of any points raised and any |
illustrations presented.

It is the purpose of the organiza-
tion to find the cause of any discrimi-
nation that exists on the campus, and
then to attempt to effect a solution
that will be lasting. Only through
understanding of each other's prob-
lems and hurts will such a purpose |
be fulfilled. The question of dis- |
crimination among Jews, Catholics,

and smooth offense of the Lambda | and Protestants is receiving the ma- |

Chi Alpha crew. |

Bucknellians Rivals
, In Local Elections

Two Bucknell graduates, Miller A.
Johnson, 20, Republican, and Curtis
C. Lesher, '04, Democrat, may run
against each other for the judgeship
of Union and Snyder counties at the
next election, it is predicted.

Curtis C. Lesher will probably re-
ceive the democratic nomination
without opposition. He has been
district attorney of Union county for
three terms.

A political survey of the prominent
Republicans of the judicial district
indicates that Johnson is the strong-
est man in the field. He is an avow-
ed candidate for the office of judge
although he has not yet made his an-
nouncement.

Adopts New System

Asbury College, Wilmore, Ky., is
another institution to adopt a new
system of final examinations. No
schedule will be arranged and all
classes will meet regularly through
the usual examination week, Teach-
ers will arrange their own semester
quizzes, and those who do not desire
to give finals will continue the regu-
lar class sessions.

American University, Washington,
D. C., has initiated a new method of
grading by which the student will be
given only a passing or failing desig-
nation. The change was made re-
cently in the hope that students will
place emphasis upon the acquisition
of knowledge and ability to think
rather than on grades. Classroom
grades on examinations and written
work will be either “satisfactory” or
“unsatisfactory.”

Another institution in which stu-
dent sentiment against the usual
grading system is crystallizing 1s
Pomona College, California where
the campus newspaper and student |‘
leaders are leading a movement |
against the practice. A quotation
from the Pomona Student Life car- |;
ries the spirit of the reaction, “Col- |
lege students do not have to be told
that they shonld study more. Col-
levians are on their own; whether
they study or not depends upon
themselves.”

Students Answer |
Appeal To Help |
Centralia Poor

Begin to Collect Offerings |
From Dormitories and
Fraternity Houses

SITUATION DESPERATE |

t

Students and other parties on the |
campus are responding to the appeal
for relief sent out from Centralia, by
contributing useful donations. Col- |
Jection of offerings has started in the
dormitories, Women's College build-
ings, and fraternity houses. The
condition of Centralia residents is
one of the most deplorable existing
in mining centers as a result of th |
depression,

Representatives of many of the
fraternities on the Bucknell campus ;
attended a short meeting of the Y.
M. C, A. Jast Monday in Room 105 of
Old Main to suggest means of secur-
ing clothing for the 150 women, 160
men, and 450 children who are in
desperate need of food and clothing
in the mining town of Centralia,
which is six miles southeast of Mount
Carmel.

Women's Committee Works
_ A large committee of women is
working in the relief program at
Centralia, which can make over much
of the clothing to suit the needs of
the children of the community. As
to the demands being placed at the
relief headquarters, William H.
Yeager, says in a letter to the gen-
eral committee and to the Bucknell
committee: ‘We have calls every day
for men’s suits, shoes and uhderwear,
also for women's shoes and dresses.”

It is requested by the local com-
mittee that all donated shoes he tied
together, and that the size be mark-
ed on the soles, also that the women
put sizes on the dresses, The col-
lection center for the men’s clothing
is Room 6 of West College, and the
contributions from the women will be
gathered in the office of Larison Hall.

To Institute System
In Holding Debates

Audiences Will Be Permitted
To Engage in Discussions
During Contests

MAY ADD TO INTEREST

Director Arthur L. Brandon will
institute a new feuture into the pres-
ent system of holding debates. — In
the home dehates, scheduled for about
the middle of the semester, the audi-
ence will be permitted to participate
n the discussions, This is done
primarily to stimulate interest in de-
bating. Negotiations are now «efi-
ritely completed for such debates
with the Universities of Maryland,
Oklahoma, and Florida.

The other teams that Bucknell
will meet this year are from Corneil,
Syracuse, New York, Fordham, and
Penn State, all of which will be held
away from home. Unemployment
insurance and free trade will be the
subjects of the discussions. The
members of the squad are already
doing research work, and making
diligent study of these questions. At
each of the weekly meetings, the
members have an open forum in
which they consider all sides of the
prospective arguments.

Anxious Students

New System of Recording Marks
Has Been Practiced In
Other Colleges

A surprise awaited the students
who lined up before the door of the
Recorder’s office, Tuesday, in quest of
last semester’s grades, Instead of
the usual pocket-sized report, they
were handed a large tinted sheet with
an all-inclusive grade record upon it.

Registrar H. W. Holter explained

ethat this new system of recording

student curricular activity had been
adopted from the plan as it is being

acticed at other colleges. Since

knell has not yet installed means
for making the sheets by the Ozoalid
method, those distributed this week
were made at Penn State, where the
method has recently been establish-
ed.

The reports of all students, grades
covering their entire stay in college,
have already been sent to the vari-
ous homes, This has been done in
an effort to acquaint both the parent
and student with actual collegiate
standing of the individual.

Lewisburg National Bank
Changes WJBU Program;
Sponsors Local Talent

The Lewisburg National Bank is
going to discontinue its “Friendly
Hour Program” as given by “Tom
and Jim” over radio station WJBU,
and instead is going to sponsor a
program of local talent every Friday
night at 7:15 o'clock.

In the first of these new programs
Rev. and Mrs. Stengel will sing some
old-time numbers. Other people list-
ed for future programs which are to
be sponsored by the bank are Miss
Sara Stahl, daughter of M. iH. Stahl,
local Reading railroad agent; the
Evangelical Church chorus; and the
Winfield chorus. ;

The “Friendly Hour Program” has
been well received by the regular
listeners to WJBU ani it is the de-
sire of the sponsors to give a diver-
sified program of local talent which
will reflect nrerit to both them and
the station.

Economic Slump
To Be Talk Subject
Of Forum Meeting

Club to Assemble February 19;
George Abernethy Will Be
Main Speaker

At the next meeting of the newly
organized Forum, which will be held
February 19, at the home of Profes-
sor Paul W. Gates, the topic for con-
sideration will be "The Causes and
Consequences of the Current Eco-
nomic Depression.” David Davis.
‘32, is to preside, and George Aber-
nethy, ‘32, will be the speaker.

The Forum, according to Professor
Gates, faculty advisor of the club,
“has a dual role to perform, first,
that of an international relations
club and second, that of a_ liberal
elub. These clubs generally have
separate organizations but it was
thought best to combine them at
Bucknell for a time in order to avoid
too much duplication and to enable
all persons interested to attend.”

The purpose of the Forum is to
study some of the more pressing
problems of the day such as the
causes and consequences of the cur-
rent economic depression, the racial
minorities in Central Europe, Euro-
pean dictatorships, the American
policy of recognition toward revolu-
tionary governments in Latin Ameri-
ca, limitation of armaments, recent
tariff legislation, the unemployment
problem, and similar questions, The

Piano Recital
By Ruth Hlavaty
Well Received

Albert Weidensaul, Mrs. Vera
MacCreadie Take Part in
Music School Concert

‘Thoroughly in accord with the
high standards set by previous School
of Musle Concert Series presenta-
tions was the recital of Miss Ruth
Hlavaty, pianist of the School of
Music, assisted by Albert Weiden-
saul, baritone, and Vera MacCreadie,
recompanist, Friday evening in the
new dormitory. :

Miss Hlavaty, of whem Bucknell-
‘ans had previously been afforded
only inadequate glimpses, showed
herself to be possessor of that qual-
ity of touch, and of color free from
mere mechanical skill, which distin-
guishes the pianist from the piano
player.

Her numbers were of romantic
character, compositions which only a
pianist of Miss Hlavaty’s ability may
render with success. Opening with
Schumann's “Symphonie Etudes,
Opus 18,” her whole program was
one which won the enthusiastic ap-
nlause of the audience.

Group Displays ‘Talent

In her second group a delightfully
simple “Gavotte,” written by Cris-
tophe Gluck and arranged by
Brahms, was the opening selection.
‘Two contemporary numbers, “White
Peacock’ by Griffes and “Island
Spell” by lreland, were well designed
to show the talent of the artist.

The final number of her program
«vas Chopin’s exquisite “Seherzo in
C-sharp minor, Opus 29.” Written
‘by a pianist for planists, Miss Ilava-
ty gave to this selection a romantic
power which won the prolonged ap-
plause of her hearers. Her response
was another of Chopin's beautiful
compositions, ‘Nocturne in F-sharp
major.” :

While the auditor might well have
wished for Miss Hlavaty's rendition
of one of the classical masterpieces,
the recital in its romantic unity was
undoubtedly well designed to show
the pianistic ability of the artist. Her
choice of numbers showed a fine ap-
preciation of romantic literature anc
af program balance.

Change in Program

Albert Weidensaul’s substitution
it Franz Schubert’s “Der Wanderer”
for the Gounod aria, “Avant de quit-
ter ces licux” decidedly improved the
orogram, in replacing it with one of
the finest works of all “Lieder” lit-
erature, The beautiful lyric quali-
ies of Mr. Weidensaul’s voiee are
well known to the Lewisburg audi-
nee. Of lesser significance were the
yrics of his secon] appearance on
he program.

Mrs. Vera MacCreadie showed,
without the tendency to come into the

foreground which distinguishes the |

nexperienced accompanist, her pian-
istic ability. Her accompaniment |
ylended beautifully with the voice of }
he soloist.

Abraham Lincoln
Subject Of Lecture

“Abraham Lincoln the Great’ is
the title given this great United
States president by Prof. H. T. Cole-
tock in his interpretation of Lincoln
rn the upperelass chapel Tuesday
norning. |

Prof. Colestock ranks Lincoln
among the illustrious great, such as
St. Paul, Pope Greyory, Pasteur.
Joseph Henry, Woodrow Wilson. Diary
win, Copernicus, and Erasmus.

Because of  [Lineoln’s ability to
treat his opponents and enemies
without malice, and return good for
wil, he is placed in company with
the great men of the world.

A second quality strong in Lincoln
is his open-mindedness to re bive
new ideals. His ability to overstep
the letter of the Taw and recognize
the spirit, thereby exercising sound,
practical judgment also insire
Lincoln's greatness.

THEM GRADE SLIPS

In our opinion these new grade

cordet’s

office are terribly bad,
things.

Few indeed are the Bucknell
whom it affords any

glasses.  Bueknell, alma mater
of Christy Mathewson, has added |
soccer and bexing to its sports }
program, purchased automobiles
for transportation of its minor
sports .teams. and is building a
new press box and plahs the pur-
chase of additional lights to pro-
vide for a night football practice
next fall.”

All of which makes us hope even }
more earnestly for the success of the | ,
Alumni Fund. Bucknell cannot at-|
ford to let football alone support it}
and its various activities—that would |
be a sorry plight for an educational
institution. Football is in itself a}
splendid sport, can in certain colleges
and universities be elassed almost,
as a racket.

Of course it is hyperbole to at-
tribute so much dependence on foot-
ball at Bucknell, but on the other
hand the great income from the
game is a sinistey' menace to the
moral fiber of the university. We
shouldn’t let football run away with
us. ;.

_ Personal Opinion

To the Editor:

For three yéars 1 have suffered in
silence when I have longed to ery out
in protest against what I consider a
plain and fancy attempt at racketeer-
ing. Perhaps the term “Academic
racketeering” woukl not be a mis-
nomer for this pernicious practice
which is costing students large sums
of money each semester. In many
cases this money can scareely be
pared, and in most eases it is un-
The practice
t ich | refer is that of constant-
ly changing the textbooks used in the
arious courses on the “Hil.”

In Lewisburg the racket is weil

ganized, Phere but one store
andling the college textbooks. The

fesor end a list of the texts
use for the semester to the
bookstore, Here they are ordered.
Simple cnough, and no apparen®
iwenue for racketeering, unless we
consider the fact that there is no
competition to bring — the price of
books within reason, But who gets
off without being “stuck” for some
one book which costs as much as |
pair of shoes or a new hat?) And
then one does not ulways get off so}
lucky, sometimes there are two oF
three books in this expensive czta-
gery required for a semester's work
in some course.

The average student would not
mind the priee of the books so rach
if there was any possibility of seli-
ing them: to the people taking the
courses the following term. But no.
In most eases another text is used.
“Phe arrangement has been found to
be better.” This explanation rare’y,
holds water, for in most cases the
text previously used and the new
text were both available at the begtn-
ning of the preceeding semester. 4
little investigation on the part of the
professor would have disclosed his

int of arrangement.

But the “unkindest cut of idl is
brought about rather subtly. In
the spring following the year u book

ot a particular courses, there is nn
announcement on the bulletin board |
“Old Main” to the effect that there

future of the organization depends.

The fact that a senior naturally

preparation for grulnation is one
that hitherto As been disregarded
by campus organizations.
Dagger quite evidently conclude
that not only will the senior benefit

Wut that the society will as well, The

For now there are few copies, avail- |

Perhaps there is an explanation of
Perhaps this |

subject, and most of all T would like
to hear from the faculty through
this medium. .

jman‘days, and have even come to

l our ‘D's* of bygone days and remem-

pleasure to glance over their scho- |
lasfie records of years past. Rather, ;
in the great majority of eases, such |
information brings only remorse for
past actions or regret for lost oppor: |
tunities. |

Nor do these concrete reminders of |
philandered time usunlly arouse good
resolutions eoneerning classes in the
semester to come. More likely we |
are prone to reflect “Im, a ‘C’ in|
Paper Bag Inflating 131, and I only |
attended class six times. Well, if 1
handshake just a bit more this se-
mester I] can get an ‘AJ so help me|
God.”

Again, we may have forgotten
some of the sore spots of our fresh-
consider Prof. Windpudding of the |
Science of Echoes Department as a
pretty good guy. Yes, we were even {
thinking of asking” him to chapérone |
our next dance. However, these ob-
noxious new grade slipg recall forcib-
ly to our minds that ib flunked us in,
his course because we weren't feeling
well the day he told his prize story
and, unfortunately, failed to’ laugh.
We see that ‘F’ and immediately
froth at the mouth, praying fervent-
ly that all his children’ will be college
professors. or

Even worse, we may see some of

ber that brilliant and
Professor of “Icelandic
who graded by the curve system.)
Understand, we can find no fault
with the “scientific curve of distribu-
tion” method of grading. It seems
logical, even to us, that there should
be so many percent C's, B's, and |
A’s in each class. In fact, we know;
of no grading system which makes
a prettier diagram when explained
on paper, than the curve system,
However, we do wonder at times,
why the majority of students occupy-
ing the desirable end of the curve}
are themselves fashioned on the sanie |
plan, |

Still, we must admit that, painful
ns these memories aroused by the
new grade slips are, they could be
borne with stoieal determonation and
would not necessitale a plea for
mercy. BUT, the situation is chang-
ed completely when we see ‘that ‘TF’
we knocked down in Public Breath-
ing 245. Then, oh untold agony, how
enn we help realling that —

— Professor Airsauce, who, it
was rumored, graded our papers by
throwing them down the cellar steps.
Even now, we might forgive him if
we hadn't, with commendable zeal,
written two books on the examina: |
tion, making our paper so heavy that
it fell all the way ‘down to the ‘F"
step.

Surely, under these conditions, the
powers that be, or Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to College
Children, will take steps to have the
new grade slips recalled, Let us
have again the old type which gave
the bad news of but one semester.
There is no use hitting a man after
he is down.

GRADUATE WORK GIVEN

Many improvements have been
taade in the chemical engineering de-
partment in the past five years and
“n that time there has been a 77 per-
sent inerense in the total number of
chemical engineering students. A
cheek of the departmental records
show that, in general, the scholastic
attainments of the students has im-
proved over this period of time.

Along with the general improve-
vent in curriculum, laboratory space
and equipment, und research ma-
serial, strong efforts have been made

to recognize qualities of personality

tion with this personnel work among
students, records are made of each

him at the beginning of the freshman

mendation for positions upon gradu-
ation.

FEBRUARY 12, 1901.

-Curriculum Improved ‘

Among changes in the curriculum,
one of the most noteworthy is the
provision for graduate work leading
to the Master of Science degree.
Since the graduate course has been
opened, each year has seen two or
three candidates for the Masters de-
wree, and the holders of this degree
have received excellent positions in
industry.

A large percentage of the depart-
mental income during the past five
years has been spent in the purchase |
of new equipment and in the devclop-
ment of a departmental library. An
industrial museum has also been de-
veloped’ with samy@s placed in cabi-
nets built for that purpose. Alto-
gether 2100 samples representing 65
industries have been gathered.

»Tweo Papers Published

In connection with the Prvnlewsite |
instruction, two papers have beea
published during the past five years
in the Journal of ie American
Chemical Society. One other paper
was published in the Journal of
Chemical Education by a member of
the faculty, and two articles are in
preparation for publication.

The returns from the — recently
given Carnegie examinations show
that 45.3 percent of all chemical en-

Of Making Rayon

T. F. Brastow and W. D. Silcox
Give Detailed Account Of
Chemical Method
Mr. ‘'T. F. Brastow, chemical engi- |
neer with the Viscose
pany of Lewistown, and Mr. W. D.!
Sileox, assistant superintendent ot |
the same plant, spoke at the Feb-
ruary open meeting of Sigma Beta
Chi Monday night. About 60 per-

sons were present.

The four main processes of manu-
facture for artificial silk were first
outlined by Mr. Brastow, who then
gave a detailed account of the chemi-
cal process used by the Viscose com-
pany. About 75 percent of the rayon
in this country is produced by the
Viscose company which owns and
operates three plunts beside — the
one at Lewistown, and which is the
largest individual producer of artifi-
cial silk in the United States. Tllus-
trations of each step in the manu-
facturing process were displayed, and
n lecture table demonstration was
carried on throughout the talk.

Odd Souvenirs Given

Individual samples of the raw ma-
terials, which are spruce pulp and
cotton linters, together with a sample
of the finished product, were given
out to each one present at the meet-
ing. It was' pointed out that ex-
treme care was taken in the chemical!
control of the process, and that only
trained men were employed for the
| chemical work. At present there are
25 chemists and chemical engineers
employed at the Lewistown — plant.
Great cure is alsu taken in the con-
trol of the temperature and moisture
in the entire plant. The temperature
is kept within one-fourth degree of
uniformity throughout the yeut

Mr, Sileox spoke on the economic
and production organization of the
Viseose company’s plant. There are
5000 employed at the Lewistown fac-
tory, the number being equally di
vided between the men and women

Industry Expanding

Pay of the employees is
the day wage and piece work, On
un average the men employed in the
factory earn twice as much as the
women. The artificial silk Industry
is an outgrowth of chemieal research
and has expanded faster than any
other textile industry.

meeting a month throughout the re-
mainder of the school year. An an-

People's chureh of St. Paul, where he
distinguished himself for effective
moral and civil service to the people.
In 1926 he was the candidate for
mayor of the  Labor-Progressive
forces, receiving over 26,000 votes
and coming within a few hundred
votes of the election. In 1928 he
was the Farmer-Labor candidate for
‘Congress and again received a large
vote.

Mr. Williams has traveled exten-
sively in this and foreign countries,
meeting personally many of the so-
cial, political, and lahor leaders of
Europe. He is now traveling over
the United States organizing, stimu-
lating, and cooperating with local
third-party political movements that
will eventually unite to create a criti-
cal opposition party comparable to
the British Labor party. Mr. Wil-
liams has a keen insight into politi-
cal and economic institutions and

Interest In Genetics Of Maize
' Leads Renowned Botanist
To Find New Genes

Dr. William HH.‘ Eyster, professor
of botany, has written a book on
“Principles in General ‘ Botany,”
which he expects to have published
in a fgw months,

The ‘book ‘is the result of Profes-

‘sor Eyster’s interest in the genetics

of corn. He has conducted a series
of experiments with corn in order to
study its inheritance, and recently
has published a selentific treatise on
“Vivipary in Maize.” This article
treats of the germs in the seeds of
corn that keep them alive. General-
ly they become dormant at one time
of the year. But Dr. Eyster has dis-
cevered that, instead, these seeds can
be kept alive, and can be sprouted
on the ear of corn.

Professor Eyster’s manuscript has
recently been submitted to Dr. Emer-
son, of Cornell, who highly recom-
mends it. Dr. Emerson has also
asked Dr. Eyster for some
vivipary seeds.

1040 Frosh Take Tests
Only « few colleges extended the
examinations to the three other col-
lege classes as did Bucknell. From
the 1040 freshmen, who took the tests|
in eight colleges, Dominic A. Zanella
and Charles R. Bidelspacher, carned
the highest scores in Chemistry and
Government respectively, the former,
also taking first place in American
History. James M. Dobbic, John L
Mohr, Aldo D’Allesandro, Robert N
Cook, Elizabeth Holden, and Charles
F. Siede took’ second place in Mathe
matics, General Culture, French

In only six colleges were the ex-}
aminations given to juniors, compris

third-year students, Thomas M. Little,
Ned T. Raker, Doris C. Miller, and
John J. Shields scored first in Mathe-

and George F. Browne scored second
respectively in French, Spanish, As-

“<Bill’’ and “Geor e’’ Assigned

Each year, shortly after the begin-
ning of the second semester, four or
five reeruits are added to the enroll-
ment list. These recruits, with such
ambiguous signatory fixtures as
“Bin” Austin and George Gilmore,
aro assigned to a room in the base-
ment of the Biology building wher
day after day for the rest of the se-
imester they are subjected to the tor-
ments of those emulnting Hippo-
crates.

Dr. Fowle's proteges are performing
various dissection feats. A student
chooses a particular portion of the
body upon which he wishes to work,
and then armored in fitting dress
and proper instruments, procceds to
“cut away.”

Mysteriously enough, it so happens

that once or twice during the year,
one or two of the cadavers takes
life, and is found on some other part
of the campus. Fortunately, how-
ever, this “miracle” does not occur
as a.voluntary gesture on the part of
the corpse.

figured bodies was found on the path

knows,

As a means of scientific investiga-

serves a noble purpose, but as an

Khayyam’sRubaiyat
Subject Of Lecture

Lois A.Stevenson Talks Tonight
At World Lit. Session
On Famous Poem

Fitzgerald’s heautiful translation
of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam
will be the subject of Miss Lois A.
Stevenson's Jecture tonight, the third
of the World Literature course this
semester.

The philosophy of Omar Khayyam
first received its vogue from the
irvansiation of Fitzgerald. Undoubt-
edly the poem gained much through
his interpretation. .

As a student of languages, and
Oriental Janguages in particular,
Fitzgerald came across the almost
erude original form of the poem.
Seeing its possibilities, he worked
Jong and earnestly over the “Qua-
trains,” which is the meaning of the
word “Rubaiyat.” As a result, his
careful translation, his polishing of
Sts phrases, and his interpretation of
its philosophy are so markedly su-
perior to the Persian version as to
make it almost his own poem.

The poem expresses beautifully
the purely Oriental philosophy of
“eat, drink, and be merry, for tomor-
row we die.” That philosophy, which
gained popularity with a certain
group. and the sheer beauty of the
phrasing of the quatrains have made
the poem most valuable in English
literature.

Fitzgerald’s labors were not com-
pleted. There are almost a thousand
quatrains in the original, and he was
able to translate only a few hin-
dyed of them.

AMONG THE BOOK STALLS :

Grand Hotel is a title which is known
fo theatre-yoers and book readers
nlike, for the book, as well as a
play adapted from it, are now eur-
yent. Originally it was written in
German by Vicki Baum, who |
gathered the materiel for her novel
while working as chambermaid in
a large German hotel. Her char-
acters are those which might be !
found at any fashinoable hostelry
in Europe. Their lives intertwine
to produce an exciting melodrama.

Miss Baum has told her story as |
one woull tell of a trip at its com-
pletion. And she tells it with such
straightforwardness, that her hotel
visitors take real proportions.
Most particularly will the reader
remember Kringelein, the — sickly,
overworked bookkeeper, who is
tasting life on his savings, and |
Flammehen, the lovely stenograph-
er, who satisfies the desire of the
pitinble Kringelein. The publish-
ing of the book at this time affords
an unusual chanee to its readers,
in that they may vivify the story

by taking in the dramatization in 6

New York.

Boners, by those who made them, is

n book for the moment, but a mo-
ment filled with uncontrollable
laughter. ‘Teachers here and
abroad have gathered together 2

boys have seriously recorded on!
test papers and such; a few illus-
trations have been drawn to amuse
those who couldn’t read, and as a
yesult we have a volume which
should prove interesting to colleg-
jans.

ON PSYCHOLOGY

With Mind as a Function of
Cells of the Brain

Dr. H. B. Pike, psychiatrist at the
Danville State Hospital, opened the
series of lectures on ‘Mental Hy-
giene” on Thursday in the Biology
lecture room before a capacity audi-
ence of students and professors. This
afternoon's jecture, which is the
second ef six tobe givenon the cam-
pus, dealt with the unconscious mind.

Tn last week's Ieeture Dr. Pike out-
lined the progress that has been
made in recent years in the treat-
ment of mental diseases. Today he
described the mind as being a fune-
tion of the cells of the brain. The
best way to study the mind is in its
development. The brain of the new-
born child is like a leaf with one
side blank, and with the other side
the parents. It is on the blank page

If we push them back, out of the
conscious mind into the unconscious,
they become repressed desires, and
as such, are frequently the cause of
a mental illness. °

THAT BUCKNELL SURVEY

The Alumni Monthly, in its curren
issue, again raises the question of a
Bucknell survey. An article on this
subject says in part:

Bucknell University does not
have a published educational
policy for the future. She does
not have a building program nor
a capable plamming committee of
any sort. She has not printed,
in recent years, a statement of
her purnose or her plans. In
short, Bucknell University is ab-
solutely devoid of a planned and
charted program for her progress.

A farmer walked into a large department store and wanted to
look at some hardware. The floor walker quickly informed him that
it was only a department store—did he think he was in a drug store?
One of our good friends tuning in on some knockers down town has
frankly informed us that we were trying to monopolize too much co!-
leye business. We'd better confess right up. Caesar was an ambi-
tious boy and we have streaks of it ourselves. We run a small
cafeteria up here and by way of a little side show sell some statlon-
ery supplies. We have a couple of tenants—probably a reprehensible
act on our part—who choose to run a barber shop and a tailor shop.
To covet desirable tenants is the unpardonable sin of real estate
dealers.

It seems to us the picture isn't quite complete yet. Might we
not suggest that the main entrance of the Commerce Departmen
should be painted a bright ved in honor of their chief apostle of chain
store propaganda. As an incentive to honor students in Bucknell’
Business College, there is still the first floor of Old Main where the
ery of the hawker has not disturbed the ‘classical atmosphere. The
should br given the concessions that we connote with the Hect
Street Fords. A nice long pushmobile overflowing with bananas ar
assorted fruits would be one of the finishing touches to this pieturé
just inside the entrance. A peanut roaster by the Registrar’s offic
would eatch a lot of business. The finishing touch would be a dainty
maid, her tray loaded with Luckies and Camels, hovering near where
the faculty is wont to loiter. From this we ean gather that ti
gerniinal seed of the Commerce and Finance Department has broug
forth a hundred fol. In other words, Bucknell is a home for Chris
ian edueation—that is, what can he squeezed in between peddlers ar
agents. Did someone say that the Dean opposed WIJBU because

We wonder if our critics have surveyed the embryo Wanamaker
down town. (Have they ever heard of a shoe shine parlor that sells
new suits, dry cleans and presses, sells soft drinks, candy, tobacco
and pop corn? Do they know of a soda fountain that don’t include
lunch and magagines?.. Did they ever hear of a combination mea:

plumbing; clothing stores that sell shoes, a sporting goods store that
almost rivals Heing’s variety? What about National Banks with
trust pewers? Drug stores that handle everything but drugs. We
even know an undertaker and gas man who warble on Sunday. Quit
a few, It seems, who don't put, all their eggs in one basket. For
which we offer no criticism, just an alibi for ourselves. _—:

One of the big surprises of the sea-

of Terpolilli, the Bison mite. Against
his C. U. opponent, “Trip” displayed
such an unorthodox style of boxing
that his opponent was greatly over-
whelmed and decisively beaten by .2
barrage of punches, which landed
while “Trip” worked his way in, out,
and around the defense of his be-

scoring pace. He had eleven points

Owls settled down to good hard work
and soon the steady flow of field

goals began to flow through the hoop, .
pole rough the 209?) Absence of Chenoweth Impairs |;

For the rest of the first half, the fans
were treated to a remarkable exhi-
bition of marksmanship. | Overhand,
underhand, one hand and some rare
species of shots, not classified as yet,
kept the assembled persons interest-
ed in more than the competition.

In the second canto, in spite of
numerous substitutions, the spectacu-
lar shooting continued. In this half
the Bisons came to life. ‘They were
not so greatly fascinated by the un-
canny hooting and even scored a few
points on their own behalf, just to
show the Philadelphians that they
were nware of the principles of the
game. Captain Ross had two field
gonls and converted seven out of
eight foul tries. Mills came througn
o score more points than he had in
iny game so far this yerr. ie ae-
counted for four double loopers and a
oul, Hepler went out early in the
first half on foul, without scoring 1
point.

The timer’s whistle finally an-
nounced that the game was over, and
+ came as a rather merciful gesture,
or Temple has a remarkable quin-
tette, and any prolongation of the
game would have resulted in an even
greater margin of victory.

Coranado’s Children make up a very
large family—children in quest of
secret mines and buried treasures,
which Coranado first sought four
hundred years ago.’ In some way,
long ago. a legend got started, tell-
ing of fabled golden cities such as
that of El Dorado, known as the
gilded man, because he was sup-
posed to have worn nothing but a
coating of gold dust. Early in
the fourteenth century, the Spani-
ards set out to look for these won-
drous cities. Corangdo spent many
fruitless years in our southwest
country searching for hidden
wealth. Men have been searching
ever since; they have found litle,
but still they go on searching. In
some respects human nature is a
determined thing.

J. Frank Dobie’s Coranado’s
Children is a collection of tales,
beautifully told, of these many ad-
venturers since Coranado. He has
made a thick volume out of them,
n volume full of adventure and
idealism. However, since the
stories all point toward the same
theme, they lose some of the
vividness toward the end of the
book.

Green Grow the Lilacs makes a very
interesting play both to see and
read. As seen in New York at the
present moment, the distinctive
feature is the aspeet of panorama,
which is afforded by looking at the
buildings from the outside, one wall
having been removed. This Lynn
Riggs drama will also read well,
for its philosophy is prominent,
and its dialogue is smoothly writ-
ten.

The theme is not important, con- |
cerning a cowboy in quest of a girl
in the days when Oklahoma was
young. But the dialect, and the
manner of speaking are rather
faithfully dond. The author
creates an atmosphere of realism
which will make the reading of |
this play stick in the memory. |

CORNELL SHOWED
UNUSUAL POWER

By Coach Joseph Reno

Although the Cornell-Bu cknell}

meet was « no-decision affair, I be-
lieve we defeated them by the mar-
gin of 4% to 2%. My opinion of the
various individual bouts is as fol-
lews:

As expected, “Trip” Terpolilli_ con-
tinued his winning streak by pound~
ing out an easy victory over Jasgar,
the Cornell mite. “Trip” was by far
too experienced and clever for his
hopelessly outclassed opponent.

Keilb was the big surprise of the
evening. The absence of Boerner,
our 125 pounder, was expected to
j leave a wide gap in our unbalanced
term; but Keilb proved to be an able

ubstitute, and filled “Mickey’s”

shoes. rather approvingly. Vougat-

Battlefield Lads Rally To
Surprise At End Of Game

GAME PLAYED IN
PLANK GYMNASIUM

An inspired Bison quintet came out
on top in one of the best games ever
staged in the Eddie Plank gymnas-
ium at Gettysburg, when coach
Bream’s Bullets went down to defeat
Thursday night after two extra ses-
sions of hectic battling. The crowd
was kept at a high pitch throughout
the game by the frequent rallies and
the spectacular shooting.

The Bisons took the lead, and at
the conclusion of the initial period,
were leading by 24 to 15 score. The
Battlefielders seemed at a loss as to
how to stop the Orange and Blue of-
fense, Which was registering steadily

as, his opponent, started the first} and holding the local hope to a mere

yound with a rush, but Keilb, acting handful

like a veteran, took control of the
tuation; he won the round without
extending himself very much. The
remainding two rounds were a repe-
tition of the first.’ By showing this

eal performance, Keilb will be an

e and dependable ubstitute, and
make the featherweight division the
trongest on the Bucknell team.

“Marchy” Slides Along

A sual, “Marehy” lemonstrated
his marvelous boxing skill and ring
generalship, hut for some reason he
w tented to “slide along” in his
encounter with Armstrong, Cornell’
135 pound entrant. My supposition

that Captain Marchesano was sav
ng himself for his impending tussle
with Brown of Army, whom 1 con

victories over Crossby, national col

Bienus Undaunted

“A hero in defeat:” that would be
more suitable than to say that Bienus

proven that he possesses courage,

that mre needed to become au great

hubman, Cornel!" 145 pouml en.
truant, was more of a “rongh-house”
affair than a boxing bout. The seran
tarted with beth boys willing to
‘mix it,” and punches flew from all
ingles: some wide, some high or low,
nd the rest somewhere in the ring;
till it was a great fight until “Stan”
was caught on the “whiskers” un-
awares and, temporarily, was on the
floor; but he jumped up, somewhat
jin a daze, and finished the round in a

second round was won by Bienus,
who was the aggressor from the be-
ginning; probably he showed this
initiative in order to square himself
for his showing in the first round.
When the third round started, the
crowd, sensed a good final round;
and they got it. It was a question of
who possessed the hardest punch, and
who could absorb the most punish-
ment without flinching. Providence
seemed to favor Shulman who has
power in his punch that is equivalent
to a mule’s kick; he again landed his
potent right hand on “Stan’s” “but-
ton;” and fearing possible injuries
to our entrant, I considered It my
duty to stop the fight, although
Bienus might have lasted the round,

joo Team Presents Strong
, Line-up in First Year
Of Organized Boxing

In the first meeting ever staged
between the Bison ringmen and the
“Rig Red" boxers representing Cor-
nell, the Bucknellians came through
to win four to three last Saturday
night.

The meet was a no-decision affair,
but various newspaper representa-
tives, and other persons who saw the
meet, gave decisions as to the out-
come of the contest. In the Cornell
team, the Bisons met with greater
opposition than they had anticipated
from the Ithacains. This is really
the first year of organized boxing at |
the New York State school, and in)
view of thi sfact they have a very |

good team.

Coach Reno was odiiged to leave

“Micky” Boerner, one twenty-fives,

at home because of illness. — In_ his |

place Kielb, a new man on the squad,

defended the one twenty-five class

and came through to win handily.
“Trip” is Steady

Terpoli!li fought his usual good
fight and had seemingly little trouble
in disposing his opponent. “Trip”
has shown « marked improvement |
over his previous work, and is becom-
ing one of the mainstays on the team. }
He has mastered a deceptive style
of attack and is very hard to hit.

Keilb, filling Boerner’s shoes, came
through to contribute a win to the
Bison cause. His man was new at
th game, thus making the affair even |
as far as experience went.

Captain Marchesano did not fight
his usual fight seemingly holding |
himself in at all times. Due to this
lack of aggressiveness, the Cornell}
| man piled up enough of a lead to an-!
| nex the decision had one been given.

Bienus Unlucky
j In the Cornell one forty fran |
| “Stan” Bienus met a tough boy and
was unable to stand up under the
barrage of hard punches which were
thrown his way. The fight was
stopped in the third round, going
‘down as a technical knockout for the
Cornell team. “Stan” was hampered

not well enough versed in the game

WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE OF
THE CHRISTIAN MINISTRY ?

“Does aman wish to mould lives 11 their most
plastic moods: to pioneer with those seeking to
blaze new trails to 2 more Christ-like order—then
let him dare to enter the Christian ministry.”

The Colgate-Rochester Divinity School

offers its facilities to those seeking professional
training for the ministry.

Albert W. Beaver, President.

Rebuttal-

I have made up my mind to say my say. I shall do it
kindly. distinctly; but I am going to do it. I know there are
many men who substantially agree with me, but who are not

in a condition to express their thoughts. They are poor; they
are in business; and they know that should they tell their |
honest thoughts—persons will refuse to patronize them—to
trade with them; they wish to get bread for their little chil-

‘dan offense tha
iny seen here withh

dren: they wish to take care of their wives; they wish to have
homes and the comforts of life. Every such person is a cer-
tificate of the meanness of the community in which he resides.
And yet I do not blame these people for not expressing their
thoughts. I say to them: “Keep yous ideas to yourself; feed
and clothe the ones you love; I will do your talking for you.”
Quotation from Robert Ingersoll.

“For everyone that partaketh of milk is without experi-
ence of the word of righteousness for he is a babe. But solid
food is for full grown men, even those who by reason of use
have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.”

From various reactions to a previous article we evolve a bd e

Bucknell translation to a familiar quotation—“You shall « Schlow § Quality Shop
know the truth and the truth shall make you sore.” The

honorable gentlemen of the negative have conveyed to us that
the verbal entrees were a little elaborate; that the dressing for
the piece de resistance was too highly seasoned. We assum-
ed that an occassional roast, sauce a la satire, would add some- eee
thing to a liquid diet. We found the assumption’ wrong; ELK KLANLNNAKNLSNALNNNNNOKNNNHNN NH HH VNN NHN ONVHVH HHH VHOY

The negative further stated “that his letters were weigh-
ty and powerful, but his bodily presence weak, and his speech FE oO R
of no account.” “That I may not seem that I would terrify

you further by my letters” and for reasons of discretion we ’
will return to a milk fed column. “Le mieux est l’ennemi du
bien” while it is a new principle of government that part of us
shall render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and an-
other part be tax free, we shall let both grow together until
the time of harvest. We can’t afford to gamble with other

the greatest allegory in world litera-

Set-up and Installation, Highly Praised by General Electric Expert,

Enables X-ray Pictures T

Also Serves For Experimental Use of the

X-ray pictures can now be made on
this campus. The Coolidge univer-
sal fine focus x-ray tube, purchased
by the physics department last June,
has been completely installed by L.
M. Roupp, graduate student, under
the direction of W. N. Lowry, assist-
ant professor of physics. The set-up
and installation were highly praised
by a General Electric expert who re-
cently inspeeted it. The x-ray ma-
chine is located in room 18 of East
College.

Several very fine pictures have
been taken of the hand and wrist by
Prof. Lowry and his assistants. One
student had an injured wrist x-rayed
at Dr. 1. P. Fowle’s request. This
was the first case in the therapeutic
history of the x-ray machine. Al-
though x-ray pietures will be taken
in case of need, as has already been,
done, it is planned to charge a rea-
scnable fee for this service. A tube
stand has been ordered, and when
this is in use pictures of the whole}
body can be taken. j

Used by Advanced Classes

Picture-emaking will be a small part
of the work done in the x-ray room.
The equipment was purchased for
the use of students in physies courses
311 and 812. These are the ad-
vaneed laboratory courses which are
open primarily to graduate students,
but which are given to undergrad-
vates capable of carrying the work.
These courses are of a project mi-
ture.

Various fields of experimentation
wre to be investigated by means of
the new x-ray equipment. An ab-
orption filter has been ordered, and
with the aid of this mass absorption
coefticients will be studied by the
photographic method. The Laue

Course in Girl Scout
Training To Be Given
First Week in May

Subject of Value To All Women
Who Wish to Learn How
o To Handle Girls

The Bucknell Course in Girl Scout
Leadership Training will be held
April 30 to May 6 in play room of the
new dormitory for women, from 4:00
to’ 5:30 each afternoon,  Registva-
tion fee is one dollar, payable at the
opening of the course.

This course will be given by Miss
Adelaide Werner, Director of Region
Ml, Girl Scouts of America, who is
a graduate of Barnard College. It
should be of the greatest value to all
women teachers, social workers,
church workers, and all other womer
who are working with or planning to
work with girls.

Rasic Course in Training

The first course is the basic
course in Girl Scout training and
should be taken by all who are work-
ing with troops, by new captains and
lieutenants as well as by those longer
in the movement who need fresh in-
spiration and enthusiasm, and by all
interested in finding out what a Girl
Scout troop actually does.  Every-

thing in this course is given in al

form that will be practical and useful
in working with girls.

‘This course outlines the Girt Scout
program as a whole, from the
Brownie to the older Girl Scout, with
special emphasis laid on teaching and
testing Tenderfoot and some Second-
Class requirements; program plan-
ning; the patrol system; nature lore
and woodcraft; simple hiking; sing-
ing; games and handicrafts.

All college women who are pian-
ning to teach will find this an admir-
able training in learning how to
handle girls. Although this training
is offered as a college course, it is
open, through the courtesy of Dean
Amelia E. Clark, to all women who
are interested in working with girls
of teen age.

Dr.M.B.Harris,’94,
Does Remarkable Work

How Dr. Mary B. Harris, '94, is
helping the woman criminal to re-
form and become a respectable citi-
zen, is revealed in an article in the
March issue of World’s Work. — Dr.
Harris, head of the Federal Institute
for Women at Alderson, West Vir-
ginia, and the only woman prison
head in the United States, is the
daughter of the late Dr. John Howard
Harris, who was president of Buck-
nell for 30 years.

In her treatment of these women
who have broken the federal law, Dr.
Harris looks to the future, not to-
wards the past. However, this in-
stitution is not a Utopia, for it is a
“junk yard” of human beings, a fac-
tory for the reconditioning of the
usuable parts. In dealing with these
women, she does not use force but
only moral persuasion. It is yremark-
able the number of good citizens
that Dr. Harris is returning to so-
ciety.

Miss Harris gained her first ex-
perience in prison work, in the cell-
block prison for women at Black-
well’s Island, New York City. She
has had other experience in other in-
dustrial homes.

Alumna Goes Up Amazon 1000 Miles
To Manaus, ‘Which Boasts Theatre,
Moessive Buildings, and Varks
An extended trip up the Amazon
river was the experience recently of
Margarida Rene, '27. She describes
the voyage in a letter to Professor
C. M. Bond, dealing particularly with
her stop at the modern city of Man-
aus. Manaus is a thousand miles up
the river, and it boasts of a theater,
massive buildings, and public parks.
“The houses’ in Manaus,” ‘Miss
Reno writes, “are long rambling struc- |
tures with a corridor in the center.
It is in these tal) eceilinged rooms that
me can get a draft of alr and ean
be protected from the fieree glare of
the sun. It rains every day during
certain seasons of the year, and when
the sun does shine, it is scorching

hot.

“Two alligators, three meters long,
were seen in the trip up the tropical
river, which is infested with poison-
ous water snakes some 45 inches
long, a type of flat fish which has
leathly sharp teeth, and an electric
poraque, which can knock one out
by the force of its electric shock.”

Miss Reno had a very close experi-
ence while paddling around in one of]
he native canoes. She had a grent
lesire to tip the canoe, rnd refre

80 Students Attend
Dr.A.Bruce Curry’s
Theological Talks

Noted Thinker Makes General
Survey of Life Stressing
Its Complexities

FACULTY ENTERTAINS
HIM AT TLUNCHEON
Approximately 80 students con-
sistently attended the five week-en¢l
conferences of Dr. A. Bruce Curry,
noted theologist and thinker, which
were held in the living room of the
Kappa Sigma house. This is the
first time that Dr. Curry ever held
such conferences in a fraternity
house.
In opening his discussions, he made
a general survey of life, stressing its
complexities. He said, “The game of
life has alrendy been dealt when we
sit down to the table, and we have to
niake the most of it!” He pointed
out that there are five major insti-
tutions which indelibly stamp the

home, the church, the = state, the
school, and the business.” “These,
along with heredity,” he said, “un-
questionably prove that all we can do
is to make the most out of life as it
ts given us.”
Describes High Religion

To Dr. Curry, there are two kinds
of religion—the low and the high.
Low religion, he asserted, is that
type of religion which is most promi-
nent in present-day churches. “It is
based upon superstition, magic, and
the supernatural; it has a God who
is a jealous God and a cruel judge.
It has the puerile belief that the
death of Christ shall take the place

of our death, and it only offers sal- |

vation to those who are saved onthe
grounds of magieal expectations.”

High religion, he said, is relative-
ly free from all such primitive con-
structions, and It never will be dog-
matic. “It believes that there Is a
fine spiritual meaning Hehind life,
and that every person is an expres-
sion of the Divine. And that divine
spark, which is in every person’s
heart can be rekindled. Every person
can be changed, thus making the
ideal of universal brotherhood en-
tirely possible. This is the gist of
the teachings of Jesus. He did not
advocate the low religion, under
which almost all of us have been
reared, but the high religion; the re-
ligion in which Einstein and the
great stientists believe. All of this
stands for the church as it might be,
as it should he, not as it is.”

At Friday noon, Dr. Curry was
guest at a faculty luncheon, given
‘n his honorin ‘the women's ‘dining
room. He spoke upon “The Fine
Art of Living.“ Other guests were
Dr. George R. Baker of New York,
Dr. Raymond M. West, pastor of the
Lewisburg Baptist church, and Dr.
H. H. Rupp. pastor of the Reformed
ehureh.

‘Dr-Pike Continues
Series of Lectures; |
Analyzes “Memory”

Classifies Memory Types As
Either Environmental
Or Organic

In the fourth leeture of his wnunual
season, Dr. H. B. Pike classified
“Memory” this afternoon as a sensa-
j tion. He indieated that there are
two main types of memory, organic
and environmental. Jt is under the
environmental type that senile de-
mentia, which accounts for IT per-,
cent of the admissions to State hos-
pitals, is found.

Organic memory, said the psyehie-
trist, Is the foundation of personality. |
Depersonalization and psyehopathic
personality are the two chief ills of
the memory sensation of the organic
type. A person with a psychopathic
personality is one who never sees
things in thelr proper light, or in
other words, is a moral imbecile.
Such «un individual generally at-
tempts many occupations but never

ucceeds at any.

Dr, Pike, 75 pereent have been of the

The report makes it clear that the

trar, departments of psychology. edu-
ction, or medicine, but would corre-|
Jate the work of all these offices. The
personnel officer, Dean Miller asserts, |
should have “no authority except that
of fact and truth.”

For the proper functionIng of the
personnel office, Dean Miller suggests
the formation of a personnel com-
mittee, to be made up of the presi
dent, the personnel officer, the regis
trar, the deans of men and women,
the medical director, the physical di-
rector, head of the department of
psychology, the alumni secretary, th:
Y. M. C. A. secretary, the chairman

the Women's Stuilent government,
the chairmen of the scholarship com
mittee, loan committee, employment
committee, and placement committer
the hend of the department of educa
tion, the secretary to the dean or the
vecorder, and three faculty member.

The purpose of the personnel con
mittee is explained by Dean Miller
as follows:

Explain Purpose

“Phe purpose of this committe
should be to correlate nll the person
rel information it is possible for us
to get about students, and to encour-
age its use; to form and direct all
personnel policies, except thase com-
ing directly from the president; to
determine and direct all personnel
research, and to make recommenda-
tions on the basis of the information
«» attained; in general, to discover
problems and te make reec mmenda-
tions for Increased efficiency and ser
vice in all departments of the uni
versity. an addition, we recommend
that the Freshman week program be
taken over entirely by the personnel
committee and planned and executed
through this committee. lv other
words, the Freshman week programs
and contacts ought to be an essential
part of the general personnel work
|throughout the year, and ought | to
reflect both the needs of the students
and the aim
versity.”

| The report goes into gome detail)

as to the working of the personnel
| office. As an example of the correln-
{tion and centralization that the com-
mittee would effect, the report says:

“This arrangement would eliminate
such committees as the scholarship
committee and loan committee as
such except as they formed a part of
the jreneral personnel committee. In
other words, all a student would
have to do would be to hand in his
name when he wanted to apply for a
scholarship, and the granting of this
scholarship would be determined by
all the factors entering into that par-
ticular ease, rather than merely by
an ‘expressed’ financial need. — This
centralized control would naturally
prohibit a student from holding, at
the same time, a scholarship, ® loan,
a job, and in addition be given ‘de-
ferred’ payment on his bills, while
another student starves.”

Captain Koss will finish a brilliant

position will be hard to fill during
the 1932 campaign. “Norm” is sure
to play his best Saturdty, and the

Bucknell’s feat in holding the | Miss Sylvia Derr for Faculty and

“Jackie” Keilb, who was having hi:

‘t fight as a 1}5-pounder, was the
cnsation of the mect with his knock-
ut victor over Whalen in the
second round. Keilb’s hard punches
have’ given Bucknell two capable men
in the class, as Terpolilli has not lost
a scrap in the two mects in the same
division. Keilb can also relieve
Boerner in the 125-pound class if the
scrappy “Mickey” needs a rest.

The excellent work of Russo as a
16(-pounder has added a great deal
to the chances of the Bucknell fight-
ers to come throngh with vietortes

We wonder whether it was the in-

that caused the faculty team to come
on the court in “ehain-gange" forma-

noise from the sidelines. Miss

State College is not to be trifled with,
borough firemen learned last night.

Shortly after 7:30 o’elock last
night, during study hour ‘‘quiet,”
fire was discovered in the Kappa
Delta Rho house. Fire whistles blew,
engines clanged to the house, fire-
men tore np the stairs and on the
roof,

A door on the second floor opened,

“What’s the big idea? Don’t you
guys know this is study hour? Pipe
down.”

Firemen poured their chemicals
down the chimney, souree of the
blaze, and tiptoed away.

AT BAPTIST DINNER

Dr. George R. Baker, of New York,
spoke at the Baptist dinner for col-
Jege students last Thursday evening.
Dr. Buker, who was formerly . the
Baptist pastor in Ithaca, N. Y. and
head of the Baptist Cornell Commis-
sion, stressed the need for lenient
judgment on the part of students for
their parents. As a parent, he gave
the code which he expected his stu
dent-son to live up to.

The dinner is un annual event
riven by tho ladies of the Baptist
church under the auspices of the
Christian Endeavor society. A_ fine

“What’s in a name,” asks the
venerable William Shakespeare, And
in attempting to answer that age-old
question, we have uncovered some
very startling facts. We have found
that our campus is one of the most |
blessed in the country, for it has
among its students no less than 60
“gracious gifts of God.” For those |
high-minded lads of astronomy, it
provides 24 “stars of the sea.” Times |
have no need to be dark around here, |
for we have 24 entrancing “lights.” |

Ah, idle readers, the answer is |
this: all names have meanings. Thus|
far we have quoted only the original
significances. For all practical ap-|
pellations, John, Mary, and Helen, re-
spectively.

We have just informed Coach
Snavely that there are, in toto, 43
“resolute helmits,” commonly known;
as “Williams.” And if that well
known saying is true that “there is
a strange identity between personal-
ity and name,” our future alumni
will he well represented in the real
estate field, for there are 28 “land-
holders,” or just—“George.”

“THE FRIENDLY BANK”

in the new Humivor Pack

W. have been in the tobacco business a long
time down here at Winston-Salem and we take
alot of pride in the quality of the cigarettes we
make. !

While we have spent a good many miltion
dollars advertising Camels, we've always held
to the old fashioned idea that the thing that
really counts is what we put into our cigarette
and not what we say about it.

If we know anything about tobaceo, and we
think we do, Camels contain the choicest Turk-
ish and the mellowest. ripest domestic leaves
that money can buy.

Tn fact we have every reason to be proud of
the quality of Camels as they come from the
factory. but the remark of an old friend of ours
from Denver some time ago emphasized a point
that has heen the problem of the cigarette
industry for years.

As he inhaled the smoke from a Camel we
gave him in our offices one morning, he sighed
with very evident enjoyment and then asked
jokingly, “What is this, a special blend re-
served for Camel executives?”

“Certainly not.” we told him. “This package
of Camels was bought at the corner store this
morning.”*

“Well,” he said, “I’ve been a dyed in the wool
Camel smoker for a good many years, hut upon
my soul I never got a cigarette as good as this in
Denver. If you would give the rest of the world
the kind of Camels you sell here in Winston-
Salem, you ought to have all the elgurette busi-
ness there is.”

Trae statement simply em-
phasized again the cigarctte
industry’s most important
prohlem. The more we
thought about it, the surer
we were that he was dead
right, and that somehow,
something must be donc.

Denver wasn’t getting a fair
break. Neither in fact was
any other town. The only peo-
ple who really knew how good
Camels could be,were the folks
right here in Winston-Salem.

That was due to a factor no
cigarette manufacturer had
ever been able to control.

Naturally there is no dilfer-

ence whatever in the quality SMOKE

A FRESH

of the tobacco in Camels, whether you buy
them in Winston-Salem, Denver or ‘Fimbhie-
too. But up to now there has been a very real
difference in the condition of the cigarettes by
the time they reached the smoker.

The, flaver and of fine tohaeeco
depend upon the retention of its natural, not

mildness

added, moisture content: which is prime at
about ten per cent.

In spite of our great pains always to make
sure Camels left the factory with just the right
amount of natural moisture, no cigarette pack-
age had ever yet been designed that could pre-
vent that precious moisture from drying out.

There: are three things about a cigarette that
can sting the tongue and unkindly burn the
throat,

(1) Cheap tobaccos.
(2) Particles of peppery duat lett in the

tobacce because of inefficient clean-
ing methods.

(3) A parched dry condition of the to-
baceo due to loss of natural moistare
by overheating or evaporation.

Always certain of the quality of our tohaccos
we had alredily made Camel a “‘dustless’’ cig-
arette by the use of a specially designed vacuum
cleaning apparatus exclusive with our factory.

Now, if we could perfect a package that would
actually act as a humidor and retain the natu-
ral moisture content, then Yuma, Arizona,
could enjoy Camels as much as we do here at
Winston-Salem.

We knew what we wanted.
We tried many things. We
asked the Pittsburgh Testing
Laboratory to help us. ,

After many experiments and
humidity tests covering all
methods of packing cigarettes
came the detailed report of
which this is the nct:

(A) No existing cigarette pack-
age, including those trapped
in glassine paper or ordinary
cellophane, gives anything like
adequate protection against
evaporation.

(B) All cigarettes so packed
tend to dry out rapidly from
the day they are released from
the factory.

(C) Only a waterproof mate-
rial with a specially devised

CIGARETTE

air-tight seal could give the desired protection.

(D) This measure, while costly, could be relied
on to keep Camels in prime condition for at
least three months in any climate.

If you have a technical bent, the graph below
made by the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory
will show you the exact results of their ex-
haustive study.

Pitteburgh Testing Laboratory Report N°150473-Jan12.1981

Pittsburgh Testing Luborutory chart above graphically
shows you that only the Camet Humidor Pack delivers
cigarettes th you in prime condition

You may be sure we gave this report a lot of
careful study, We checked it and re-checked it
and then we went ahead. We tried this device
and that. At last we met suecess. The air-tight
wrapping involved the designing of special
processes, special machines.

That costs a lot of money, more than $2,000,-
000 the first year, but after you have tried
Camels packed this modern new way we are
sure you will agree it is a fine investment.

For some time now every Camel that has left
our factory has gone out in this new Humidor
Pack.

We have said nothing about it until now, to
make sure your dealer would be able to supply
you when the good news came out.

Camel smokers of course have already dis-
covered that their favorite cigarette is better
and milder now than ever hefore.

If you aren’t a Camel smoker, try them just
to see what a difference there really is between
harsh, dried out tobaceo and a properly con-
ditioned cigarette.

You can feel the difference, you ean hear the
difference and you certainly can taste the dif-
ference.

Of course we're prejudiced,

We always have helieved that Camel is the
world’s best cigarette,

Now we knovw it.

dust treat yourself! to Camels in the new
Humidor Pack and sec if yon don't agree.

“MEGHANISTICMIND
PALSE CONCEPT,”
STATES DR. PIKE

Psychiatrist Thinks Emotion
Center of Complex Acts of
Human Existence

MANY STUDENTS TO GO
TO DANVILLE CLINIC
“Beauty of nature, music, litera-
ture, and love would mean nothing
to the individual If the mind were
merely used for thinking,” was Dr.
H. B. Pike’s statement this afternoon
n the fifth of a series of lectures.
Dr. Pike wishes to refute the com-
non idea that the mind is a mechan-
sm for thinking. He believes that
emotion is the center of the complex
acts that make up human existence,
ind that emotion is the result of in-
teraction between the individual and
js environment. The doctor will
show this point more clearly when
the students supplement his lectures
sith a visit to the clinic at Danville.
A large group of students is expected
to make the trip this year, since the
preparatory lectures have been at-
tended to capacity.

satire.

“The poem, like Dante's,” asserts
Dr. Robbins, “is another of the com-
pendiums that were so popular dur-
ing the Middle Ages. The story it-
self, which is a vision of the winning
of his love by the lover and the difi-
culties involved, becomes entirely
subsidiary to the picturesque and
poetic digressions. Many outbursts
oceur against women, superstition.
and the abuse of power by those in
authority.”

Three Students Leave

Because of Il] Health

Ill health has been the cause of
three: student withdrawals from col-
lege recently. Winifred Fox, '32,
and Barbara Brohme, '33, left the
campus at the end of February, and
John Volgarino, ’31, left this week.

Miss Fox, who came here from the
University of Pennsylvania, has re-
turned to her home in Cynwyd, while
Miss Brohme has saited for Miami,
Florida, where she will join her
parents. Volgarino plans to go to
the seashore for a rest, but will re-
turn here in the fall. He has just
retired as president of Cap and Dag-
ger.

Now is the time of the year when Buck-
nell’s students can do the most service for
their Alma Mater.’ After all is said and done
the advertising offered by Bucknell’s Students
makes possible her only real publicity.

In spite of the fact that room space has been
provided in Larison Hall to accommodate more
women, nevertheless the Registrar again re-
quests that Bucknellians who know of pros-
pective women students urge them to get their

applications in at once.

The present economic depression spares no social class.
All people feel it in varying’degrees. The professional man,
the business man, the manufacturer, skilled and unskilled
labor and the coupon clippers, are all suffering from shrunken
incomes. But it has its cortpensations; inflated prices have
received a solar-plexus blow. The. College Inn receipts hav:
shrunk in dollar sales, they have increased in amount of goods
sold, Particularly true in meal values, we are passing on to
the consumer the advantages of cheaper prices. Students
who feel the pinch of hard times will find their diminished al-
lowances will go farther here.

A vegetable dinner, four varieties, bread and butter, is
cnly thirty-five cents. Meat meals, including potatoes, two
vegetables, beverage and bread and butter, range from forty
to fifty cents. Board by the week, six dollars without break

‘Tustin gym reverberated to the
cheers and yells of a real old-fash-
joned inter-elass conflict Tuesday af-
ternoon when the annual freshman-
sophomore basketball game was
played with as much old time spirit
as was ever displayed on the Bucknell
campus. The sophs finnlly overcame
the lead of the frosh to win 49-47.
The game was close throughout
the 40 minutes of playing time, the
id changing with nearly every field
al. The sophs started the scoring,
the frosh soon caught up and
rent into the lead. At half time
the score stood 28-20 for the first
year team.

A recent survey of student editors
in the south brought forth some in-
teresting statements on the hue and
cry that has been raised of late re-
varding overemphasis of college foot
all
| The comment of all was surpris
lingly alike in opinion. For instance,
editor Dungan of the North Carolina
Tar Heel says, “I think college foot
hall in general is tending very defi
nitely toward the professional,” and
this from editor Moore of Georgia's
ted and Black, “college football is
becoming professionalized gradually
which is certainly unfortunate be-
Jeuuse of the ill feelings aroused be
tween non-subsidized athletes and
subsidized athletes, scholarly athletes
and the morons.”

Better Couches

The editors are unanimous in theit
jdesire for the best possible coache
They are divided on the question of
“player control.” The majority favor
a shortening of the long schedule,
and also favor a continued method of
Jetting the public view the game
Some of the editors, however, are in
favor of moderating this somewhat,
mainly by eliminating the ‘high pres-
sure methods used in dispensing
tickets.

To sum up, they want the sport as
their own game, with the best coach-
ing but without alumni interference;
they want good teams but teams of
students, without subsidized players;
* + they don’t ban the public from view
ing their games, but don’t care to
have the games played primarily a
public entertainment.

Handle Well, Difficult, Roles
Of “Journey’s End”

By Wenneth A. Haynes, 31
We went to see the Delta Sigma
interpret “Journey's End”
having beforehand witnessed that
spectuculnr performance on Broad-
way. But unlike many of the guests
Saturday evening, we did not go with
the motton of comparing the two
nroductions. We wanted to see how
, group of inexperienced eollegians
would handle R. C. Sherriff’s gripping
drama of life and death in the
trenches.

Without reserve, we can say
Jirector William DeLancey and his
“ast staged a drama that surpasses
any other production of its type given
here within the last four years. And
n addition. at least three new per-
sonalities witl iting ~~ possihilities
have been discovered.

Stage Setting Natural

When Jack Younghusband,
was in full possession of his lines his
haracterization was brilliant. The
seene in which he expressed his
eagerness to be off for the attack
sparkled with heart-felt enthust-
asm. Younghusband’s greatest tri-
amph was the setting of the dugout,
which he designed and executed with
complete naturalness. To this set
the play owes no small measure of
ts success.

The speeches in the drama were
written to be said in a staccato man-
ner, just like the staecato voices of
the guns The cast was not well
nough acquainted with its lines to
permit of this. Therefore many o
the talkative scenes (and the drama
s very talkative) were slow

The Alpha Chi Mu basketeers held
Theta Upsilon Omega to a 25-24
seore lust evening in a closely con-
tested game that was reminiscent of
the days when DeFilipo held interfra-
ternity basketball under control. Two
extra five-ininute periods were neces-
sary to break a tie score, and only
close culling on the part of Cheno-
weth kept the two clubs from open
warfare,

Jn the second game of the evening
Phi Gamma Delta won an easy vie-
tory over Delta Kappa Phi in a game
that was 2 walk-away for both the
Fijis and the spectators. The game
ended 37-18 with Wheeling, of D. K.
P., sharing honors with McFarland
of the Phi Gams.

The Phi Kappas completely upset
Beta Kappa by marking up 43 points
against 16 for their opponents. Trud-
nak, of Phi Kappa, scored 20 points
‘on ten field goals, and both teams
kept the whistle blowing by shooting

from every position on the floor.

If vou will hold a cigarette to each ear

Dean Clark Presents Cup

The presentation of the cups,
which are being offered as a part of
the activity of Phi Mu Alpha, honor-
ary musical fraternity, will be made
this evening by Dean Amelia Clark.
Last year the presentation was made
to Delta Delta Delta, at which time
Kappa Delta was awarded honorable
mention. The latter group won the
contest the preceeding year.

According to the revised ruling for
the women’s contest the cups must
be won two years in succession be-
fore they may be kept permanently.
There keen rivalry between the
sorority groups, and a close competi-
tion is expected by the chairman of
the women’s sing, Jean Colvin, ‘31.

The majority of the campus activi-
ties have been suspended for this
evening, so that a large audienee is}
expected for the contest,

Ushers for the women's sing will
be recruited from Phi Mu Alpha,
while the men’s sing next week will
kave ushers from Mu Phi Epsilon,
women's musical fraternity. Ten
fraternities have agreed to enter the

men’s contest.

“Spenser, the greatest representa

to give moral instruction and to por-

his inspiration from Malory’s ‘Morte

great poets and writers.

“Spenser was undoubtedly a great
poet. Ile showed love of beauty,
beauty of sound and color, beauty of
body and mind, and beauty of spirit-

much for its musical beauty as
for its morality. There is much in-

Ask any professor, he’ll tell you-
that most college students are woe-
fully ignorant in the matter of cur-
rent happenings. They are so ab-
sorbed in their studies—that’s the |
wrong word—in all the things that
go to make up college life, then, that
they don’t know what's going on in
the outer world, the world into which
about 150 of them are going to jump
in a few months.

Perhaps most students can recite
offhand a few facts concerning the
Viking disaster or the Vivian Gordon |
murder ease, or cin volunteer Infor-
mation as to how the Athletics and
Giants are making out in their pre-
season games, But only a

The Student Senate at Franklin

move, very similar to that taken

Fitting the service
to the customer's needs -

Bell System service is custom-made. Each of
the 65,000,000 telephone calls handled in the
average day must meet the exact wishes of
the person making the call.

Telephone men study a customer’s com-
munication needs, then advise the type of
equipment that fits them best. For depart-
ment stores they may recommend the “order
turret’? — a special switchboard for taking
orders by telephone. Thus they enlarge the

store’s service and simplify ordering for the
customer. They develop equipment and plans
for brokerage houses, police departments,
nation-wide sales forces — and all manner of
business firms.

The telephone industry continues to grow
by fitting its service more and more com-
pletely to the user’s needs. For men with
insight and the ability to coordinate, the
opportunity is there!

Plays Selections

Guests. of -the campus elub Dues- |
alay evening crowded Bueknell Hall
to witness a east of faculty members
offer two well-known one-itet plays. |

The cast of the plays consisted of
Mary Wright, Roberta Metcher, and
Professors C. Willard Smith, George |
trland, Harwood Childs, and Cicero |
Ogburn.

In the first play, “Trifles,” the two
avomen earried the situation, and very
gracefully covered up a difficult mo- |
ment when a bat, which had made |
tts way into the hall, hovered over
the heads of the players. |

‘¥f Men Played Cards as Women
Do” was the second play, und was
made up of an all-male cast. The
professors won many laughs from
the audience because of their fomi- |
nine actions. Professor Irland was
perhaps the most outstanding in both
plays, perhaps due to his experience
{n numerous town presentations.

Both plays were directed by Mrs.
C. Willard Smith, and the settings
were arranged by Walter Hopper,

Orange and Blue Boxers Chalk
Up 444 to 2!6 Win Over
Philadelphia Foemen

FIRST BISON WIN

Boerner, Marchesano, Russo,
And Egel Win Bouts;
Kielb Draws
In one of the most thrilling boxing
meets ever engaged in by a Bison
ring team, Coach Reno's charges de-
feated Temple by a 4!2 to 242 score
at the high school gym Saturday

night.

All of the bouts, with the exception
of the 160-pound class, were closely
contested, with the margin of victory
coming only after the hottest com-
petition. Clever boxing ability and
hard hitting combined to make the ex-
hibition extremely interesting from
the speetator’s point of view.

The first fight, in the 115-pound |
class, was a torrid affair from the}
first bell until the final punch was]
thrown. Joe Kielb, who has shown |
constant improvement with — each
bout, drew with D’Allesundre, an ex
perienced and clever boy D’Alle-
sandro’s esperienee was matehed by
the aggres and willingness to
mix it up of the Bison mite.

final punch which would have put his
opponent away for the count. Fisch- {
hoff fought with an unorthodox, left-

to prevent Marchesano from eom-

DROPS TO PHI MUS

Winners Swamp Losing Sextet
By 58-8 Score in Only
Game Tuesday
The Phi Mu basketball girls com-
pletely swamped the Delta Zeta team
Tuesday evening to the, tune of 58 to
8. The Alpha Chi Omega-Kappa
Delta game seheduled for the same
evening was postponed until next
week, while the faculty sextet for-
feited to the Delta Delta Delta team.
With the Delta Zeta defeat and the
faculty forfeiture both teams have
now lost three games each, which
puts them definitely out of the run-
ning for further contests. The only
game played Tuesday evening was
slow and uninteresting with D. An-
thony and K. Grove consistently
scoring for the Phi Mus. The latter
netted 24 markers during the game.
The score at the close of the half
was 41-2. Bobbie Smith was the

best consistent player for the Delta
Zetas,

BURSTING BUBBLES
PURSUED BY COEDS

Fair Dianas Of The Hunt Go
Through Convolutions
In Dancing’s Name

e vvepepeneevessensscecnevensuanseneanoaeaeetonenc@nesard retest:
daeuesvecauseagesssansentercanacetessenvessgunsessessoneosees:

With their eyes on‘ imaginary
bubbles and their ankles swathed in
cheesecloth, the members of the na-
tural dancing classes at the “Sem”
go through their paces twice u week.

Although the natural aspects of
thelr art is rather obscure, the wo-
men leap along cheerfully enough
under the direction of Miss Roberta
Melcher, instructor in physieal edu-
cation. With spring in the offing,
and the well-known wine of youth to
inspire them, the ladies admit that
the drab atmosphere of the Harris
Hall gym does not depress their
spirits.

The favorite dance of the class is
that which involves the pursuit of
a bubble. According to very good
authority, the story of the bubble
chase is as follows: young woman
properly encased in pink cheesecloth
blows imaginary bubble in air; hav-
ing blown it to proper altitude,
chases it, almost catches it, but it
breaks; young lady is bowed to
ground with appropriate grief. Dance
is over, get your money back at the
door.

“Pursuit is the life breath of na-
tural dancing,” we may quote one
member of the class as saying, “We
pursue bubbles, we pursue each
other, and all the time we're sup-
posed to be pursuing higher educa-
tion.”

Among Best Fistic Matches He Has Seen

By Coach Joseph Reno

The Hueknell mittmen defeated
Temple by two-wins: Saturday night
in one of the best meets it has been
my good fortune to see; each bout
was packed with thrills as the boys
were determined to win decisively.
Kielb and D'Allesandro, the opposing
miteman, ushered in the evening’s
ntertainment with a slugfest that
ended in au draw. There wasn’t a
dull moment at any time during this
hout, both boys fighting as though
their lives depended on the outcome
of the battle. It was only D’Alle-
sandro's experience which enabled
him to earn a draw with “Dynamite
Joey.”

The next bout was another “punch-
ing bee" between Boerner and Cuden,
the respective featherweights. The
first round found both boys trying to
end the fight as quick as possible.
Cuden had a shade in this round, but
jt didn't last long, as ‘Micky came
out with a rush in the second round
and put Cuden down for a nine count
to win the round by a farmer's mile.
The third round was closely contest-
ed, and the bell was sweet musie to
their ears, as they were both “dog
tired.”

Bout Thrilling

The bout in the 135-pound class

was snother thriller that had every-

“Lou” had improved 500 pereent.
This together with his dynamite right
helped materially in his victory.
Loses to Temple

After a hard three-round bout,
“Johuny” Kubacki lost the decision
to Haubrich the ‘Temple star. MHau-
brich will be remembered for the
wonderful serap he put up against
“Lou” Mutzel last year. Kubacki is
learning fast. He takes to boxing
like a duck to water and should be
u consistent winner next year.

“Norm” Egel again jumped to the
unlimited class to give “Swede” Han-
son of Temple football fame a sound
trouncing. The “Swede” was almost
n head taller than “Norm” and had
at least a 25 pound weight advant-
age, but this trifle didn’t disturb
Ege) in the least. The first round

found both boys eager. They met in}

mid ring and threw punches from all
pngles with the “Swede” having a
little the best of the going.
was a wasted effort on the “Swede's”
part, for beginning with the second
round, “Norm” was all over Hanson
sending in punches “high, wide, and
handsome;” in other words hitting
the “Swede” with everything but the
‘bucket and stool. During a flurry of
punches he succeeded in sending
Hanson to the floor, but the bell came
to the “Swede’s” aid, although — it

Fischhoff had a very deceptive style, Dhirderdtad, cee a cq ct the

Fischhotf must have thought there rr i whe emi job.
was a cloud burst of boxing gloves
{n the gym.

The bout between “Dutch” Borella
and* Kutcher of Temple is hard to
describe, but } must say that it was
better than any comedy IT have ever
seen. Kutcher was so bewildered by
Dutch’s anttes that he didn’t know
whether to laugh or cry. This bout,
although it lasted only one round,
was well worth the price of admis-
sion, Theo weren't many punches
struck, but Duteh did the Charleston,
black bottom, clog, soft shoe dance,
and a marathon all in two minutes
time. Nevertheless, Dutch showed
the stuff he was made of by consent-
ing to go against Kuther, and so tire
him as to keep him from fighting
both the 145 and 160-pound elass. He
did this knowing he was hopelessly
outclassed, and he should be com-
mended for his grit and courage. = I
wish te extend my thanks to Dutch
through this article for helping me
when I most needed help.

“Lou" Russe's guns were aimed
very accurately Saturday night. He
came through with a two-round K.
O. vietory over Guerney, his Temple
antugonist. At the outset of the bout

Snakes of a brilliant green com-

dining room Tuesday night. The co-
eds had not come down with the de-
lirium tremens, even though the din-|
ner had been rather elaborate. They
were only celebrating St. Patrick’
Day.

A Celtic spirit pervaded the meal
and the room. Erin potatoes (ordi-
narily called creamed), Celtic salad
(its title inspired by the green a
paragus that composed it), and trish
jello (so-called because of its green-
ish hue) topped with green
whipped cream carried out the Irish
atmosphere, The tables were like|
ancient Trish coats of arms, in as
much as cach of them had green
snakes rampant, one at each woman’s|
place. Napkins of green deeorated
with harps completed the picture.

A shrine of green candles with one
large, particularly lively looking,
candy snake was stutioned at the
door of the dining room.

The inter-fraternity league stand-

the results of the games last night.

the race in League I by defeating |
Phi Kappa, the Phi Psis vanquished |

Phi Kappa Psi won from Delta

with 19 points, most of them being |

THIRTY DAY TEST

HE whole country is talking about the throat-
easy mildness and the prime freshness of Camel

Cigarettes in the new Humidor Pack.

The above chart prepared by the Paco Testing

Laboratory tells you why.

Please examine it carefully. It is an unfailing guide
to cigarette seléetion and enjoyment.

As you can quickly see by the three upper curves on
this interesting chart, cigarettes that lack the protec-
tion of the Humidor Pack lose their moisture rapidly
from the day they are manufactured.

And day by day as this moisture disappears, the
smoke from these cigarettes becomes harsher, hotter,
more unkind to the smoker’s throat.

Not so with Camels!

The Humidor Pack is moisture proof and sealed air-
tight at every point. It protects the rich, flavorful

Artificial heat in houses and

mark of a considerate hostess,

Make these tests yourself
It is so easy to tell the difference between parched dry
cigarettes and fresh prime Camels that it is no wonder
everybody is reaching for a fresh cigaretic today.

Your fingers identify stale, dried-out tobaccos at once.
While a Camel is flexible and pliant.

Your ears can tell the difference too. For a dust-dry
cigarette crackles under pressure.

But the real test is taste and there is simply no com-

FRED VOTAW HERO

The swan may glide proudly over
the surface of the lake, but when the
swan tries to walk, it painfully re-
sembles another bird. Thus it was
with Princess Alexandra — Ferenc
Molnar’s ‘“Swan’—who fell in love
us a gesture of freedom from 1
domineering parent and an_ indiffer-

Elizabeth Dill’s quality of reserve
already fits her to step into the title
role of this romantic comedy, which
the posters tell us is to be produced
as a Frill and Frown offering on
April 9 and 10. By looking in on
rehearsals down in Bucknell Hall one
may readily see that “Betty” will be
able to thoroughly master her char-
acterization.

P.D.E’s. DANCE BAND LEADER

COOLS HEELS OF KING’S MEN

With Ray Calabrese and his Am-
bassadors furnishing their famous
music, the annual Pi Delta Epsilon
dance in Tustin gym Saturday night
promises to surpass any of this
honorary journalistic fraternity’s so-
cial affairs of other years.

Ray Calabrese, the director, is a
pianist of international reputation
and popularity, and was associated
for many years with Ben Bernie.
While touring Europe with the ‘Old
Maestro” several years ago, Cala-
brese had the distinction of causing
King Alphonso’s cabinet to cool their
heels for more than half an hour
while the young Yankee pianist
scorched the keys to the insistent d°-
mands of the “playboy of Spain.”

: Picked Veteran Musicians

The fact that he was a veteran in

the orchestra’ game enabled Ray

li i é DRAENOR RUN

=r

Calabrese to pick the right men for
his own orchestra. First, he plucked
“Piggy” Bower from Keith’s circuit
where he was a sensation as “The
Wonder Drummer.” Then he took
“Len” Berman, Fred Waring’s crack
xylophonist, “Donny” Shrader, hot
saxaphonist, from Dillion Ober, and
went as far West as Seattle to get
“Tiny” Kingsburg, the featured tenor
of the Seattle Harmony Kings. Every
man was carefully selected until .the
present outstanding combination was
organized.

After getting a trial in New York,
Ray Calabrese made good to the ex-
tent that he stayed cighteen months
at the Club Alzar, where he acted
as master of ceremonies as well.
Gotham’s dancers are fickle, and this
phenomenal run speaks volumes for
the high clars work performed.

Registrar Holter
Outlines Bucknell’s
Financial Problem

Average Student Here Pays Only
60 or 70 Percent of Actual
Cost of Education

FUNDS LACKING FOR
BUILDING NEW GYM

According to Registrar H. W. Hol-
ter, the average Bucknellian pays
not more than from 60 to 70 percent
ef the actual cost of his college edu-
cation. Myr. Holter, who spoke in
freshman chapel Tuesday on ‘The
Cost of a College Education,” also
stressed the fact that Bucknell is in
need of a new gymnasium, but that
funds are lacking for the building of
such.

‘It is due to the many friends of
Bucknell,” he said “that we now have
a plan asset of $2,500,000 and
endowment, funds amounting to
$1,250,090. College deficits are
usually met by these three means:
gifts from philanthropists, state or
national alds, and the fees of the stu-
dents. Bucknell, unfortunately, does
not receive financial aid from either
the state or national governments.
Daily expenses at Bucknell amount
up as high as $2000, The individual
student pays less for his tuition thon
it actually costs the college to edu-

| cate him.”

DELTA DELTA DELTA,
KAPPA DELTA GIRLS
WIN SING TROPHIES

For 2nd Consecutive Season
Two Sororities Maintain
Same Places

PHI MU THIRD HIGHEST;
COMPETITION CLOSE

Deltu Delta Delta’s and Kappa
Delta’s sorority suites now sport a
new trophy each as a result of the
judges decision in the inter-fratern-
jty song contest Thursday night in
the Baptist church. The two groups
were adjudged the first and second |
best respectively. |

For the second consecutive season
these two groups have held the same
places. When the two cups were
awarded by President Emory Hunt,
a mistake in figuring caused a mis-
take in the presentation so that the
trophies had to be awarded a second
time.

Phi Mu sorority was third, highest
in the contest, the competition be-
tween this group and the winners be-
ing close. The Tri Delta chorus was
outstanding, however, due largely to
the fact that it was the largest group
among the competitors.

Concert Shows Finish

A consensus of opinion the
School of Music showed thatthe con-
test evidenced more finish this sea-
son than ever before, indicating that
more interest had developed in the
sing and more intensive rehearsals
had been conducted. :

The enthusiasm of the audience in}
singing the songs flashed on a sereen}
before the contest was quite evident.
Dorothy Iddings, '31, who played on|
the organ at this time, aided in creat-|
ing this atmosphere. |

Inter-fraternity sings, which were |
jntroduced here three years ago in an
effort to encourage a study of Buck-
nell songs, have a different air about
them from that of any other intra-
mural function. The predominating
black tone in the dresses of the
choristers appealed to the large au-
dience.

DR. H. B. PIKE ENDS
SERIES OF TALKS
AT ANNUAL CLINIC

Students and Professors Makc |
Annual Visit to Clinic; See
Illustrative Cases

Students and professors am

Bucknell, Bloomsburg State Teachers
College, and the Berwick and}
Bloomsburg Training schools attend |
ed the clinie at the Danville State
Hospital Saturday morning given in
conclusion to the series of lectures |
which Dr. H. B. Pike has delivered
in the past six weeks. Cases were |
brought before the clinic which il-
Justrated the various types of men-
tal disease mentioned by Dr. Pike in
his lectures. |

Dr, Allan Jackson, superintendent
of the hospital, welcomed the visit
jng students, nurses and Instructors.
In his talk Dr. Jackson told of the
organization of the hospital, of its |
function, and how it is operated. fle}
also said that the grounds of the |
Danville institution were among the
finest of the land. The clinic held at
Danville is thought to be the first of
its kind in America.

Presents Striking Cases

Cases illustrating illusions, hallu-
cinations, structural abnormalities,
hereditary defects, and environmen-
tal defects were brought into the
clinic by Dr. Pike. Very definite
proof as to the fact of transmission
of mental disease through hereditary
channels was given by the lecturer.
Case after case was cited where many
members of a single family had been
inmates of the Danville hospital or
of similar institutions.

It was pointed out at the clinic by
both Dr. Pike and Dr. Jackson that
one of the main aims in their work
was the prevention of mental dis-
ease through the spread of mental
hygiene. Dr. Jackson is a pioneer in
this work and is receiving recogni-
tion all over the country for it. :

Mental disease can be recognized
in the majority of cases before they
become very serious and can there-
fore be treated. Many individuals
are discharged from the Danville
hospital annually who can go back
into their own communities and take
up their work because their cases
were recognized and treated.

After the clinic, the men and wo-
men were conducted in separate
groups through the wards of the hos-
pital. On these tours the visitors
saw the various wards, the mess
halls, the work shops, and the treat-
ing rooms. No padded cells are used
at Danville nor is there any rough
treatment of patients. The food
served to the patients is of high
quality and ample quantity, as is
evidenced by the: gain in weight of
patients after they have been there
a short while. J

FRESHMEN, JUNIORS |

Mimic Dance; Impersonate |
Many Faculty Members

The doors were thrown open, the
orchestra (one piano) erashed into
its opening notes, and eager fresh-
men and their junior escorts filed
past the receiving line which formed
at the right as the Mock Junior Prom
got under way.

Such notables as
Rivenburg, Dean Amelia E.
Professor R. H. Robinson. the house-
mothers, and other well-known mem |
bers of the faculty impersonated by’
the women welcomed the devotees of
the dance. The fair Prom guests
and their partners soon followed the
example of the two deans, who had
the first dance together.

The floor was a mass of glowing
color from costumes beautiful in
their originality. Particularly  strik-
ing was a little mauve and white
creation done in bath towels. Pro-
fessor Ballentine’s costume of a toga
banded in baby blue seemed particu-
larly appropriate. Farmers and
farmerettes, artists of both sexes,
and South Sea island beauties were
present.

Dean Clark illustrated the proper
method of performing setting up
exercises, and Dean Rivenburg gave|
an exhibition of the terpsichorean
art. The orchestra was good and the
house mothers squelched all couples
so-ill-behaved as to neck. It was a
model dance.

Refreshments and dancing conclud-
ed the evening, at which time a wary
eye was kept on wateh for the senior
and sophomore women who had drift-
ed to the Prom, attracted by the
sounds of hilarity. The dignified
seniors entertained their sophomore
sisters with dancing ‘and refresh-
ments, but limited their hilarity to
the oecasional genuine Cherokee
war-whoops.

Personal Opinion

| To The [ditor:

| May I suggest yet another crusade
for you? You are accomplishing re-
sults with your platform of free dis-
[cussion of Bucknell problems. May
|you ever be free to attack injustice,
ignorance, petty policies, and worn
|out customs. I also wish you joy in
your work of editing a real news-
paper and trust that you can com-
mand student opinion and respeet
which are so vital to the success of
any newspaper,

A good jolt is necessary to pry
loose “sticklers” and the lethargic.
So also is frankness needed to bring
to the attention of enreless and
thoughtless students their misdeeds.

My particular “gripe,” and I have
heard it echoed by many, is the ap-
pearance of the campus underneath,
dormitory windows. Broken glass
(surely not anything but milk bot-
tles), orange peels, paper, boxes,’
junk, trash, and other articles too
numerous to mention (as the sale bill
reads) certainly do not add to the
beauty of what was once a lovely
lawn. (This, of course, depends
upon what your idea of beauty is and
where you were “fetched up’).

Use your pen on these “Dormitory
Vandals,” for they deserve no better
name. Have they no pride in their
own campus? Must they throw
things out of windows? Are they
too poor to buy wastebaskets or too
careless to use them? Perhaps you
can start a fund to buy wastebasket:

for poor students with the slogan
“Trash Baskets for The Trashy” o1
something!

Let the Y. M. C. A. teach a course
of “manners” to the dormitory resi-
dents. That woud be somethings
practical.

Tet us have more and better
torials for a Better Bucknell.

Sincerely,

edi-

To the Editor:

‘It seems to me that editorials such
as your recent one deploring the lack
of student interest in current events
are a waste of time. You suppose
that the purchase of a few more
newspapers and magazines would
help the situation. Evidently you
have not spent much time in the li-
brary. The funnies, sports, and ro-
togravure sections are about all that
interest the average student. The
only students who regularly read
Magazines are those taking the
courses in current history.

course a few new additions to the}
library would give them a wider se- |

leetion.

Why is it that only one percent of
our students consistently follow cur-
rent events in newspapers and more
important weeklies? One reason is
that our educational system here Is
so organized that important matters
have no real place. From the start
students give all their time to the
activities for which college is run—
dating, athletics, fraternities, loafing,
and self interest. It requires super-

human effort on the part of the aver: |

STUDENTS SPEAK, SING

The many members of the Wo-|
men’s Missionary Union of the Bap-
tist Chureh of Lewisburg were enter-
tained last Monday evening in the
church by several students who took
part in an original program of
speeches and singing representative
of the various nationalities in Ameri-
ca.

This program, which was under the
chairmanshfp of Miss Rachel Arm-
strong, hostess in the new dormi-
tory, took the place of the regular
meeting of the missionary union. Re-
freshments were served following
the program.

A quartet of women consisting of
Constance Williamson, ‘32, Ruth
Taylor, °82, Ruth Baker, °33, and
Ruth LeyMeister, '34, opened the pro
gram with a delightful Czecho-Slo-
yakian folk song. Margaret Cornely
‘88, was piano accompanist. Dolores
Chaves, special student, was dressed
in her native Mexican costume’ and
spoke on the industries and general
life in Mexico.

Describes Panama Life

Evelyn Ganzemuller, ’84, who has
been living in Panama for the past
ten years, described the life on the
4slands ‘neighboring Panama and the
work of a famous woman missionary
on those islands. The quartet then
rendered another folk song which
was followed by a delightful piano
solo seleetion played by Margaret
Cornely.

Josephine Lefkowitz, '34, spoke on
“The Contributions of the Jews to
America,” stressing “the importance
of the work of modern, Jewish phil-
nnthropists, educators, industrialists,

philosophers, and ‘scientists. Andrew
D. Zanella, 33, a brilliant Itallan stu-
dent, ‘gave a well-received talk on
“Italian Traits” and the abuse of the
Italians ‘in’ general.

Phi Kappa‘s court squad won the

evening by vanquishing the Kappa

Trudnak accounted for more than
half the winners points, scoring
points between them.

Phi Kap’s team was entirely too

could not get by the giant Phi Kap
guards, while Trudnak and Mezza}
scored repeatedly by virtue of their
height. The score at half time was

men, and they managed to keep this

goals and one foul try fer a total |

interesting. The game was unusual-

COHEN GETS DECISION

Coach Carl Snavely Expects
Team To Be Stronger
Than Last Year's

According to Coach Carl G. Snave-
ly, the baseball team of this season
shonld be one of the best in reeent
years, and should be able to present
a tough proposition to any nine that
opposes it. Practice started Monday
for all who are not football men, and
by the end of the week it is expected
that the whole outfit will get under|

way, using North Field until the dia-
mond on Loomis Field is conditioned.

With the material coming up from
last year’s freshman team, which had
a fairly good season, added to the
returning varsity men, the prospect
seem quite bright. The greatest
strength of the outfit will probably
be in the pitching staff led by “Steve”
Trudnak, recently chosen on the Col-

and

Bucknell has used three different
men in the one-fifteen class. "Tem-

in the midget section, and earned a
win and a draw. Then “Dynamite

and proceeded to win two bouts by
the knockout method and to gain a
decision over the redoubtable D‘Al-
lesandro.  Kielb’s dropping out of
schoo! necessitated finding still, a
third man for this class. Alex Cohen,
who fought “Trip” Terpolilli in the
inter-class fights, stepped into the

Never in the history of boxing
here have their been so many deter-

of the team. The personnel during
the whole of the season was never

The initial engagement with Cath

The second was the no-decision af-

successful, it will be held annually
in the spring.

Present plans for the meet indlicave
that it will be conducted by a com
mittee composed of the track man-

Senior Council.

Plant Offers Aid

Coach John Plant has permitted

speak on the general theme of the
place of the church and Christianity
in the world.

His most potent lecture was given
Tuesday evening in Bucknell Hall,
where he gave a unique and inter-
esting portrayal and interpretation of
Paul of Tarsus. He prefaced his
yemarks with the statement that “the
greatest argument for Christianity is
a christian life.

The lecture itself was done in an
entirely new vein. Dean Graham
gave the entire talk in the first per-
son, putting himself in the person
and mind of “the great leader and
reformer, Paul of Tarsus.”

Grips Audience

As an eminent preacher and lee-
turer, the speaker was able to grip
nis andience with his picture of the
boyhood, manhood, and old age of
Paul. He produced vivid pictures in
the mind ef his audience of the life
and troubles of that Biblical period.

“We will have one of the best
reshman track teams in the history
yf Bucknell,” said Charles (Chuck)
Titus, '31, freshman track coach dur-
ng an interview yesterday.

The diminutive coach, his face
wreathed in smiles, was watching hix
men take their turne on the outdoor
track on Loomis field. His  faee
seemed to portray the results he
hoped to obtain this year.

“You know,” he declared, “we have
some of the best men we've ever had
out for track this year. Why 1 re-
member when we had to fairly beg
for material, but it's not that way
anymore.”

The trackmen have been in train-
ng only u little over two weeks but
he way they spurted around the
track, it looked like Bucknell’s fresh
men track team was going to equal
the undefeated record registered by
the '34 football team.

“We are undertaking the biggest |
schedule we have ever tried but ther
s nothing like plenty of competition
to keep the boys in trim,” Couch
Titus continued,

“It looks like track
line at Bucknell, and
men cin chalk up a good record, then
the varsity will have something to}
yuild on.

"Yes," he concluded, “it look ke
4 great se.son.”

| Orpheum To Be R Be Remodeled By

Steifel Brothers; Expenses
Amount to $10,000

The Orpheum theater will soon be
no more!

Ralph F. Koser, proprietor, an-
nounced this week that the theater
had been sold to Steifel Brothers of
Philadelphia, owners of a chain of
cinema houses, who will spend about
$10,000 in remodeling the local pic-
ture palace. The name will be
changed to the Roxy theater.

The contract was signed last week,
and the new managers will take over
the theater immediately. The build-
ing will be closed for renovation
from Monday, April 20, to May 1.
New seats, an entirely different style
of interior decoration, and new sound
equipment wil) be installed, making
the Roxy one of the most modern
small theaters in this section.

Most of the theaters in the Steifel
chain bear the name Roxy. The new
managers intend to bring only first
class attractions to Lewisburg, in
keeping with the policy they follow
elsewhere.

MAY FINISH BOXING

Boxing Commission To Collect
| Twentieth of Gross Receipts
Of Intercollegiate Sport

|LEHIGH OPPOSES MOVE;
TAKES CASE TO COURT

Vhat boxing may be forced out as}

an intercollegiate sport at Bucknel
if a recent act of the Pennsylvania
legislature is enforced, is the opin-
ion of John D. Plant, director of phy
sical education.

The McBride bill, which was made
law during the course of the present
session, provides that five percent of
the gross receipts of intercollegiate
boxing or wresting matches be turn-
ed over ‘to the state hoxing conmnis-
sion; thit a state inspector be pres-
ent at all matches; and that colleges
that promote the sports be required
to take out a license.

Colleges and universities through-
state have become aroused
legislation. Lehigh Uni-
versity athletic officials are taking
the matter to the courts in an effort
to keep the law from being enforced.

Mr. Plant states that boxing at
Bucknell does not earn enough to
ineet the expenses the new law would
impose on the college whenever a
bout is held,

Mr. Leiser was born in Lewisburg)
July 17, 1850, making his age at the
time of his death nearly 8] years.

Nearly 81 Years Old

The deceased was a charter mem-
ber of Pennsylvania Bar association,
and for many years was a member of
the examining committee. He was a)
life-long member of the local Luth-
eran church and served on the official
board for a number of terms. While
a student at Bucknell he became ni
member of the Phi Kappa Isi fra-]
ternity and has taken an active part
in its affairs ever since. He was
presiding officer at the Grand Arch
Council of that society, held in Phila-
delphia in July, 1876. He was chief-
ly instrumental in securing the re-|

moval of the iron-elad pledge, which}
was imposed on Greck letter socie-
tles by President Justin R. Loomis
and made any student incligible for
graduation who was ua member of
such an organization. When the
loca) chapter was in danger of losing
ts charter in 1912 as the result of
opposition by a chapter in a larger
university, it was Mr. Leiser who
took up the defense of the local
group and practically single-handed
won the fight.

Lived in Lewisburg

Mr. Leiser was the eldest son o|
the Jate Dr. William and Maria Al-
bright I#iser and has spent practical- |
ly his entire life in Lewisburg. The
ancestral stock to which Mr. Leiser
belonged goes back on both sides to
the original settlement of the state.
On April 17, 1877, he was united in
marriage to Susan Matilda Brecken-
stein, daughter of the lute Rev. and
Mrs. John C. Breckenstein, the cere-j
mony taking place at Bethlchem, Pa.
They had two children, Andrew Al-
bright Leiser, Jr., who was associat-
ed with his father in practicing of

wife of Attorney Roy G. Bostwick, of

MONEY GRAB

Boxing at Bucknell faces a crisis,

Mr. Frank Weiner of the state ath-,

|ber, for the Interest of the student
| body in tennis is great and at pres: |
jent the courts are treniendously over-
lerowded. The addition of four courts
will not greatly alleviate the situa-
tion,

However, courts eannot be built in

week, and so something onght to}
be done to meet the current over- |
crowding. It is almost impossible to

|We believe a solution to the problem
would be to have students sign up
{for the courts in advance at some)
central place, say the registrar's of-|
fice. Players: would be limited to}
two sets, and then the next couple
j would have the use of the court.

believes that “courting in the parlor
or kitchen is sometimes embarass-
ing.”

Tf all cities sould build such “pet-
ting palaces” a dangerous phase of
the traffic problem would be solvedl—
at least in Inclement weather. Bui
the question remains whether this
standardization will appeal to the
younger generation. Also, would it
not be rather obvious to arrange to
meet a girl at the “petting palace”
at eight o’clock sharp? How will

fall, someone is murdered—and in
the midst of it all, there you are.

the parents react to such a commun-
istic encouragement of a “dangerous
diversion?”

New York by Paul Morand, is like. a
breath of home to anyone who has
lived in New York. To anyone
who has never lived there, it is an
education in city life. For vivid,
life-like word pictures, for clever-
ness of detail, for brightness of
deserlption, for unexcelled humor,
read this book. And by the way,
the black and white wood cuts are
the most modern and most attrac-
tive that could be found for such a
book. They are in all ways as ap-
pealing and descriptive as the
reading. ‘

As for the furnishing of the palace
we believe it might be plausible to
build the booths with automobile in-
teriors in order that the surround-
ings might ‘seem comfortably realis-
tic to the occupants. A horn so
placed that it could be accidentally
honked would create the nth degree
of familiarity.

The Times concludes by remarking
that “it should be a great success if
it does not become so popular.
and the palace so thronged....
to defeat its own purpose.” At
Princeton we solve our tennis and
squash court problems by allowing
their use for only a limited length of

Somewhere in this issue is made
mention of the new ruling that all
modern language teachers henceforth
mst have spent some time in the
country whose language they aim to
teach. This is progress we admit,
but it is also anti-Americanism. Bill
Thompson (late resident of Chicago)
would have righteously objeeted to
the coming generations learning
foreign languages with anything but
an American accent.

It is with deep regret that we an-
nounce that the Scotch atmosphere
pervading the campus at present was
not bottled in 1902. It arises from

Projects for the Celebration
Of Centennial Anniversary

To be Elaborate

ALUMNI FUND GROWS
TO MORE THAN $3000

The March issue of the Alumni
Monthly which appeared in print
‘Tuesday, contains an interesting fea-
ture article on “Plans for the Fu-
ture,” in which locations of proposed
buildings for the Bucknell campus
are discussed and names for the
are discussed, and names for the
campus are suggested.

Elaborate plans for the Centennial
anniversary of the University in 1946
are set forth by the Alumni Secre-
tary, A. G. Stoughton, who states
that many of the proposed new build-
ings will be actualities at that time.
Among the changes, remodeling, and
onstruction of campus _ structures
suggested are a new gymnasium on
‘North Field; a modern library on the
lower campus near the present Bot-
any Building; an Arts Building
across from the Engincering Build-
ing, which will at that time, accord-
ing to the writer, have unother large
wing; the remodeling of the entire
building of Old Main into a large,
‘modern men’s dormitory; the con-
struction of a beautiful new Chapel
midway - between Memorial Stadium
and the Engineering Building; the
addition of a large wing to Bucknell
Hall which could be used by the
‘modern language department; and
the transforming of the present Car-
negie Library into an Administration
Building.

j

The April meeting of the Sigma |
Beta Chi, honorary chemical engineer-
ing fraternity, was held Monday eve-
ning in the Chemistry building with
more than 30 students in attendance,
The program was-festured by anead-
dress by Arnold Houtz, of the De-
partment of Labor and Industry, of
flarrisburg, together with several
veels of moving pictures showing the
refining process of petroleum = pro-
duets, —

Mr. Houtz gave, an interesting
demonstration of the vegetable fibers
hair, und feathers used in the manu-
facturing of life belts, pillows, fur-
niture, bedding, and an outline of
the methods used by the state in
protecting the consumer from adult-
eration and fraud from manufactured
products in these fields.

Field Novel

This particulary field is one of
novelty und newness to the chemist
as very little work has been done on
the chemical properties of these ma-
terials. The Commonwealth of Penn
sylvania hfs been a pioneer in this
field, and the state Jaboratories have
developer! methods which have been
adopted by the U.
and several states in the union.

Following Mr. Houtz's discussion
the group enjoyed four reels of mov-
ing pictures, showing the steps used
in the refining of petroleum pro-
ducts, The pietures advanced new
ideus showing the reacting procecd-
ing inside of the equipment used in
the production of petroleum products
from crude oil. — :

The May meeting will be featured
by an address of a technical repre-
sentative of the Carnegie Steel Cor-
poration who will present a talk of
wide informational value. The fra-
ternity extends a cordial invitation
to other students on the campus to
attend these lectures.

Will Fight it Out For
Number One Post

VILLANOVA FIRST MEET

Tennis, with the advent of spring
weather, is proving its usual popu-
larity. Regular practice for the var-
sity team started Monday with Pro-
fessor F. G. Ballentine, coach of
tennis, in charge. All indications
are that number one position will go
to either Fred L. Englerth, '33, or
Charles Siede, '33.

Varsity practice is held every af-
ternoon at 3 o’clock on the courts at
All varsity men have
preference to the courts over other
students, and students have prefer-
ence to the courts over townspeople.

| The abandoning of the courts at the

women’s college is not helping the
crowded court condition, especially
since the new courts on north field
are not ready for use.
Nets at “Sig” House

A change has been made in the
housing of the nets for use on the
north field courts. In previous years
the nets have been kept at the home
of Professor Ballentine, but this year
they are to be obtained at the Sigma
Chi house. New equipment has been
purchased and has arrived. This

| equipment is mostly for the use of

the varsity, but the new nets may be
ised by students

Violet Quintet Sinks Lambda
Chis In Two Contests
Before Vacation

ERY SERIES STAR

After being runner-up for the past
four years, Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s
quintet finally landed the inter-fra-
ternity basketball championship. The
victors’ superiority was unquestioned
as they won the championship by
swamping Lambda Chi Alpha’s
courtmen jin two consecutive games,
played the Friday and Monday even-
ing before vacation.

Harry Fry, rangy 5. A. E. center,
was the star of the series, scoring 15
points in the first skirmish and 24
points in the windup. | Grudkowski
and Beckley, L. C. A’s. all-fraternity
guards, bore the brunt of the work
for the losers. In both contests, the
score was close during the first half,
but early in the second half the S.
‘A. E’s soon tured the games into
routs, .

Both games were exciting, the
large crowd being treated to several
spectacular plays and shots. The
combination of Fry and Ammerman
for the winners was a hard one to
stop, and these two rolled up a large
number of points. The winners fin-
ished the court season in a blaze of
glory, winning ten successive con-
tests.

BISONS OPEN SEASON
IN BASEBALL BATTLE
AGAINST BULLETS

Success of Local Nine Depends.
Upon Ability of Snavely to:
Muster Out Batting Strength

BULLETS TOUGH FOE

With the first game of the seasor
only one day away, Coach Snavely’
is making an effort to whip his var-
sity baseball team into shape to meet
Gettysburg in the opener at Loomis
field tomorrow afternoon.

Jf Snavely can muster togethet
some batting strength, the Bison:
should have another good season ox
the diamond. Gettysburg was th:
toughest foe on the Bucknell card
last year, the Bullets winning twe
games through their hard clubbing.
Bucknell was weak with the stick last
spring, but played sensationally as
times on the defense.

Prospects for a successful seasoi
are good, since only one man frorr.
ast year’s team has graduated.
Trudnak, all-American College
Humor pitcher, should have a greac
season in the box. ‘He has acquire!
considerable experience and polish,
end coupled with his fast ball shoulc
hold the opposition in check. “Fred*
Long will be available to relieve
“Trudy” in the rough spots.

Discusses Prospects

Couch Snavely, in diseussing pro=-
pects for the season, said, “The tear
this year is the best since I have
come here. However, we are undet
a severe handicap, since several of
the first string players are ineligible
to make trips. Some of the main-
stays of the team are on thie
ineligible list which includes, Hinkle,
Fry, and Neid. At home these mer
will be permitted to play, and the
chances for victory will be in-
creased.”

“MICKEY” BOERNER
MADE RING CAPTAIN

Bison 125-pounder Unanimously
Elected Boxing Leader of
1932 Mitt Team

Alfred “Mickey” Boerner, hard-
hitting 125-pounder of the boxing
squad, was unanimously elected cap-
tain of the 1932 boxing team just
before vacation. “Mickey” was the
only junior fighting on this year’s

for| team.

During the past season, Boerner
has been a consistent winner and in
every mect has pleased the fans by
his willingness to mix it. Although

|} he was defeated by a narrow margin

by Di Pasquali of Catholic U, he won
all his other battles in a good two-
fisted style. On the trips he gave
his Army man a beating, won easily
with West Virginta, and returned to
Lewisburg to come within an inch of
putting his Temple opponent to sleep.
In the last bout of the year “Mickey”
defeated the Carnegie Tech 125-
pound man by a knock-out in the
first round, thus ending successfully
his third year of inter-collegiate box-
ing.

i

FRY IS CENTER

The annual task of picking an All-
fraternity basketball team is an ex-
tremely difficult one this year as the
race for the championship was a free
for all affair with four or five fra-
ternities all having a chance at the
play-off. This situation brought a
large number of excellent players
into the limelight,and made the job
of selecting any five men for the first
team an unusually hard one.

In picking this team the value of
the man to the team as a whole was
considered as well as the individual
brilliance of the players. |

At the forward posts Ammerman
and Borella were given the places of
honor. Borella won his position for
his uncanny ability to seore. It was
largely due to his work that the
Lambda Chi Alpha team entered the
finals. Ammerman was undoubtedly
the best choice for the other post.
His floor play was consistently good,
and his timely passes to other mem-
bers of the “Sig Alph’ quintette w-|
counted for a great many more
points than “Shan” got himself.

Fry Selected as Center

The pivot position went to Harry
Fry without any question. His
height gave him an advantage not!
only on the tip-off, but in taking the
ball from the backboard and drop-
ping it through for a goal. Second |
choice went to “Ken” Miller who |
jumped center for the “Sig” team. |
Miller would fit very well into the |
first team line-up, but Fry plays a)
more experienced and smoother type
of basketball.

The guards presented « hard prob-
lem to solve as there were far more |
good guards in the two leagues than
there were forwards. Eastburn,
Beckley, Stonebreaker, and Grudkow-
tki present a quartette of guards
among which there is very little}
choice, Eastburn and Beckley are
placed on the first team because of
the stabilizing influence which they
exerted over the rest of their respec-
tive teams, at the same time that
they were playing a brand of bdas-|
ketball that is hard to beat. East-
burn, in addition to his floor game
and guarding found time to run up
au nice string of field goals in every
game,

DISTANT RELATIVES

This one recently came over the radio. Mamma, asked the little
daughter, who is my nearest relative? Why, my child, that’s yeadily
apparent, I am your nearest relative and your Scotch father is your
closest relative. Considering the matter of public utilities, we can
readily discover some very distant relatives. Tracing back as far as
the Ark and the Flood, we have found no connection between the local
water company rates and the public service they render, Probably
somewhere between Adam and Noah, the Pennsylvania Public Service
Commission have discovered that there are some very distant rela-
tions. Through some queer reasoning we are compelled to support
them in much greater luxury than our nearest of kin.

Every time this company changes hands, the cost of gravity gots
up. When prices everywhere else are going down “replacement”
values are going up. The inverse ratio game of monopolies protected
by corrupt politicians, alias The Seven White Horsemen of the Penn-
sylvania Public Service Commission. Let Jessie James hide his
shame, he was only a little piker.

The College Inn has not forgotten that not so long ago, through
inability to pay such outrageous charges, our water was cut off, ten-
ants were inconvenienced and the life of our business threatened.
These demi-gods—absentee landlords—showed the same mental
strength as the poor dumbbells who imprison a man for debt, making
it, entirely impossible for him to pay his debts. A product as free as
the air, absolutely indispensible to life and business and yet suddenly
cut off. Even the highwayman would spare your life if you were
hroke. It onght to be a cardinal virtue to gypt a company like that.

The College Inn water bill approximates $200.00 a year, almost a
dollar a day for every active day business. Practically all big users
we know are resurting to deep wells. They can't stand the exorbi-
tant rates, neither can we. We recently installed an automatic water
system, using a hundred foot well, twenty feet of casing and eighty
feet of solid rock. The College Inn invites you to have a clear, cool
and pure drink of water, uncontaminated by monopolistic greed and
corrupt politics. We know you will enjoy it. Any interested parties
anxious to end a similar slavery are invited to inspect the plant.

dramatists have frequently produced.

The play was seheduled for a two-
night showing, ‘but in reality the
Thursday night production was in the
nature of a dress rehearsal. In the}
first evening's presentation the ac-{
tors showed that Molnar’s romantic
comedy yas within their scope, while
n Friday night’s production they
gave a smooth and finished perform-
ance. ‘

Unfortunately, for the size of the
second night’s crowd, the actors -
got many of their lines in the firs
night's showing, The audience was
kept waiting 35 minutes for the rise
of the curtain and this restlessness
increased with the  fifteen-minute
waits between acts. However, ‘the
seenery was well-done and the ens-
tuming was execllent.

Second Performance Better

Friday night the players gave a
distinctly improved performance
Beautiful and reserved, Betty Dill,
‘31, gave « finished portrayal of the
young princess whose emotions at
times perplexed her. It is to be re
gretted that at times she spoke in
such a low tone that she failed to
reach her audience.

Fred Votaw, ‘31, as the prince in
search of a suitable princess, was

almost too realistic, a fault which he| Sent an attempt on the part of those six years later. Fo

may be traced to poor directing
rather than to lack of experience.
The tutor who complicated matters
was convincingly played by Philip

over act some of his lines, he was
especially natural in his seenes with
the young prineess.

Wishing to further test the oa |

hoped that people at distant points |

of the reception.

The station has recently undergone
extensive remodeling, and it is
thought by those in charge that re-

of students at Bucknell frequently)
tune in on the DX program and are)
often quite pleased to hear the bro: ade |

Ten Prominent Bucknellians To:
Give Rational Religious
Talks to Frosh rs

J. Willis Miller, dean of freshmen,
tolay announced that ten outstand-
ing men on the Bucknell campus will
present their attitudes on the subject
of religion during the coming fresh-
periods in a series of
rational religious talks. Dean Mille:
opened this series in chapel, April
10, by presenting a brief talk con-
ey the importance of religion.

“This series of talks will repre-

ligion to honestly place before us
the fundamental attitude toward a}
rational, normal, healthy religion,”
said the dean. “The larger part of |
the student body does not frankly}
face the question of religion. I he-
lieve that it is the greatest unifying
factor of humanity. It tends to
give diversification to society.

“This series of talks is more than

a mere gesture. It is an attempt to!

of religion, Lach speech is going to
be a carefully worked out judgment
of the spesker, and is to be taken as
such, The various attitudes need not
unduly influence you, nor must you}
take the opinions of those who pre-|
ent them. They are really meant to
open up the question of religion in
your own minds, Searching ques-
tions on immortality and religion!
and all will be fully discussed.”

For Next Year

3 PROFESSORS RETURN

Several changes in the personnel
of the faculty for next year were an-
nouneed to the Bucknellian today by
President Emory 'Hunt. Five new
professors will be added to the teach-
ing staff for the fall semester, and
three former faculty members will
return at that time.

Since the trustee ruling which pro-
vides that no two members of one
family may teach at Bucknell at the
same time will go into effect at the
beginning of the next semester, the
positions of Mrs. Helen E. Sprague,
Mrs. Marion B, Davis, and Mrs. Vera
C. Rockwell are to be taken next fall
by Kerl Orth, Lanehard Gummo, and
Miss Louise Padou, respectively.

Mr. Orth, who is a personal friend
and classmate of Dr. Leo L. Rock-
well, is now Studienrat at the gym-
nasium St. Ingbert in Saar, Ger-
many. He received his university
training at Munich, where he spe-
cialized in modern languages. Fol-
lowing this he taught in the public
schools of Bavaria and traveled cx-
tensively. During his stay on this
campus fhe professor expects to do
research work in Pennsylvania Ger-
man,

Gummo Supervises Art

The department in art will be su-
pervised by Mr. Gummo, who spent
his freshman year at Bucknell in
1925. He will complete a three-year
course at Yale this June when he
will receive his master of arts degree.
Some of his time here will be devoted
to private painting. ‘Miss Padou
comes here from Hiram College,
Ohio, where she is teaching Spanish
at the present time. She reecived
her master of arts degree at the
University of Wisconsin.

Willard A. Laning, '27, will take
the place of John B. Miller, instruc-
tor in electrical engineering, who has
been granted a year's leave of ab-
sence. To take the place of Dale
Sharp, of the department of com’
meree and finance, Alvin B. Bicoe,

Sponsors Conference on
Pressure Groups

As one of a group of specialists
who will meet in a conference spon-
sored by the Social Science Research
Council, Dr. Harwood L. Childs will
go to the University of Chicago May
2 and 3. The subject for the meet-
ing is for research upon pressure
groups and propaganda.

The purpose of the convention is
threefold: to assist in clarifying the
fundamental conceptions, to review
the existing state of the research,
and to recommend methods and prob-
lems which appear to offer the most
promise for further investigation,
should a consensus arise in the
course of the deliberation.

Each of the men attending this
meeting is asked to submit a state-
ment of his working conception of
“pressure groups” and ‘‘propagan-
da,” and a provisional delimitation
of this field of research.

LUND SAYS COEDS
STRIVE FOR MARKS

Former Bucknell Professor Says
Examinations Show Women
Memorize—Not Reason

SPEAKS TO SAVANTS

Women students work for grades
more often than do men. Such is
one of the conclusions Dr. Frederick
H, Lund, former head of the depart-
ment of psychology, reached after a
study of students here.

Dr. Lund read a paper dealing with
this and allied subjects on Saturday
at the second spring meeting of the
New York branch of the American
Psychological association at Colum-
bia University. The following ae-
count of his report appeared in the
New York Herald Tribune on Sun-
day, April 19:

Women Use Rote

Dr. Frederick H. Lund, professor
of Wsychology at Temple University,
presenting the result of the first at-
tempt ever made to measure memory
over a long period of time, reported
that women students master school
subjects largely through rote and
verbal facility, without any genuine
understanding, and that after a lapse
of three years they have forgotten
far more than men students.

Tests of the entire freshmen class
of Bucknell University showed that
women had forgotten more than 75
pereent of their science and mathe-
matics after three years, as com-
pared with less than 40 percent for
men, acording to Professor

terested primarily in grades, while
men were more interested in attempt- |

ing to conquer their physical enviren- fi,

ment.

UNIVERSITY WOMEN
MAY BE ORGANIZED

Dean Clark is Formulating Plan
To Group 200 Local Women
Into National Association

A branch organization of the
American Association of University
Women may be organized at Buck-
nell in the near future if plans which
are now being formulated by a local
group, headed by Dean Amelia E.
Clark, prove feasible.

Although a complete list has not
yet been compiled, it is estimated
that there are at least 200 college
women in Lewisburg, Milton, Mifflin-
burg, and Sunbury, who will be
eligible for membership. These in-
clude graduates of Bucknell and of
other colleges that are on the fully
approved list of the Association.

Dean Clark, who is a member of
the national organization, stated to-
day that undergraduates may not be
admitted to membership in either
the local or national organizations,
but that they become members if
they make proper application follow-
ing their graduation.

Friend of Potentate

Dr. Harrison is well-known around
the regions of the Persian Gulf for
his services of healing the Arabs.
He has lived for years in Kuwait,
Bahrain, and more recently, at Ma-
trah, at the southernmost point of
the Gulf. He has also made tours
and expeditions into the unknown in-
terior where very few white men
have ever dared to penetrate, and is

We has devoted his entire life, thus

For twenty years, he has been using
his gifts for treating the little-un-

derstood members of the proud, sen-]

sitive race of the Arabs, expertenc-
ing a loneliness and hardship which
few would and have been willing to
encounter.

As a result of the information
which he has gathered from personal
contact, he has written an authori-
tative work “The Arab at Home,” in
which he concludes “Arabia will take
her place in the great brotherhood
of nations, one of the most richly
endowed of them all.”

In a meeting this morning the
Sociological Club voted to terminate
activities for the season by having
a tour of inspection of Lewisburg in-
dustries and social organizations fol-
lowed by a dinner to which, represen-
tative business men would be invited.

it has been the opinion of the
group throughout the season that
there is not a close enough relation-
ship existing between the students
and the business men of town and it

will create more contacts. The so-

Meet Will Be Close

The strength of the respective
teams is such that the meet will be a
very closely contested affair, with
the outcome devolving upon the win-
ning of the relay event which will
end the program. The varsity men
who will participate are so divided
among the entering teams that their
presence will not give a great advant-
uge to any one team.

The offieials who will be in charge
of the meet have not all been select-
ed as yet, but Professors Harriman,
Bond, Page, and W. T, Johnson have
consented to lend their services in an
official capacity. Other men who
will be on hand are, A. G. Stoughton,
Guy Payne, and possibly one other;
alumnus together with several stu-
dents,

A large crowd is anticipated, as
the student interest seems to have
been aroused, and the campus
“greeks” will all be out to spur their
more ambitious brothers on to vic-
tory. The track has been groomed
for the event and should be in good
shape, so that with fair weather and
a fast track, some good performances
should be turned in.

FRESHMEN TO DANCE

SATURDAY EVENING

Yearlings’ Dance To Be First
Sport Frolic of Season;
Deans are Invited
The freshman frolic to be held in
the gym Saturday evening is usually
considered a sort of freedom party
for the college in general, sinee it is
the first sport dance of the season,
and the restraining bonds of cold

weather have been thrown aside.

This year the weather bids fair to
permit of white flannels and sleeve-
less dresses, which is unusual for
the Freshman Hop. Decorations of
green and white for the occrsion will
reflect the atmosphere of spring. The
committee in charge has also an-
nouneell that there will be no pro-
grams for the dancers.

Chaperonage for the freshman
event will be under the supeviston of
Professor and Mrs. Ralph Page and
Professor and Mrs. Frank Burpee.
Invitations have also been extended
to Dean Amelia Clark, Dean and
Mrs. Romeyn Rivenburg, Dean and
Mrs. J. Hillis Miller, and Mr. and
Mrs. Malcom Musser.

BUCKNELL NETSTERS
TO MEET VILLANOVA

Visiting Main Line Team Here
Saturday; Boasts of
Georgetown Win

The lid will pop off on the tennis
season Saturday when the Bison clay
court men meet the Villanova net ex-
perts on the varsity courts in North
Field. The visiting team boasts a 5
to 4 victory over Georgetown.

Under the direction of Coach F.
G. Ballentine the Bucknell squad has
been having daily workouts on the
varsity courts. The probable team
which will participate in the Satur-
day match is made up of Seide,
Englerth, Wright and ‘Halpern. The
courts, should be in excellent shape
if they are given time to dry proper-
ly, and consequently the play should
be fast.

Rain interfered with the - reund-
robin tournament which was to be
the means of selecting the Bucknell
team, so that chances of an upset in
team places was decreased. There
are several promising freshmen out
for the team and later in the season
they may win berths.

NATURAL DANCERS
TURN 10 PURSUIT
OF BOAR HUNTING

Coed Terpsichoreans Learn
Art of Charging Wily
Beasts in Forest

ROCKING BABIES SAID
TO CALM SAVAGE IRE

From bubbles to boars and then to
babies is the long distance record
held by the members of the women's
natura) dancing classes conducted at
the Women’s College by the depart-
ment of physical education.

When we last heard from the
gauze-clad sisterhood, they were in
mad pursuit of bubbles. Now it’s
boars they're chasing. With slow
and measured movements they creep
up on the wily beast three times a
week. In the order of things, they
occasionally make a Junge at him and
pierce his hide with their spears.
Then they circle around the prostrate
creature with little skips, giving the
impression that each dancer is suf-
fering from pains in the feet and is
seeking to alleviate the suffering by
lifting first one foot and then the
other from the floor.

Spear Throwing Obstacle

The only difficulty in the death ofj)

‘tthe beast is the manner of throwing
the spear which causes his :

Being composed of mere women the
‘class is in some doubt as to how to
throw its spears. Usually the victim
‘is given a short reprieve while the
spear throwers debate over the prob
lem, but he never escapes the Buek-
nell Amazons.

In order to calm the savage in-
stincts aroused in the feminine breast
by boar hunting, the class follows
the chase with an exercise in matern-
al instinct. To the sound of a lullaby
played on a nearby piano each mem-
ber of the class cradles one arm in
the other, gazes soulfully at it, rocks
the first arm back and forth and then
plants a gentle and presumably ma-
ternal kiss on her elbow. The class
is then dismissed until the next stalk-
ing party is called.

GERMANIA HEARS
TALK ON GERMAN
PASSION DRAMA

Mrs. Phillips Lectures on Play
_ Given Every Ten Years at
a Oberammergau

A paper on the aesthetic qualities
of the Oberammergau passion play
was read by Mrs. J. D. Phillips, as-
sistant professor of English, at the
Monday meeting of Germania held in
the playroom.

Mrs. Phillips, who saw the play in
1910, said that it was an example of
art affecting its producers, rather
than being affected by them. She
described the costumes as rich, but
said that they were of such dull, fad-
ed colors that every shade blended to
form a harmonious whole.

The last meeting of Germania for
the year will take place early in May.

Mary Wolfe, ’96, a member of
—y eanill of directors of the Penn-
sylvania Council of Republican Wo
Bag spoke recently before 200 mem-
vers of the Lycoming County Repub-
lican Women's Council on “Herbert
Hoover.” According to Dr. Wolfe,
President Hoover has been placed in
a false position deliberately by those
unfriendly to him. Nevertheless, he
has un enviable record of achieve-
ment, and, if he should run for presi-
dent again, would be elected by a
greater majority than before.

Dr. Mary Wolfe is an ardent Re-
publican and was recently appointed:
chairman of the north-central divis-:
ion of the state council of Republican
women, a district which includes
twelve counties. Dr. Wolfe was
graduated from the Institute in 1891,
She received her Bachelor of Arts}
degree from the University in 1896
and her Master of Arts in 1900.|
Later, she received the degree of
Doctor of Medicine from the Univer-
sity of Michigan.

After her graduation, she was for
several years in charge of the Penn-|
sylvania Hospital for the Insane ati
Norristown. When it was proposed
to create an institution for feeble-
minded women, she was made a
member of the commission which
chose the site. After the institution
had been completed at Laurelton,
she was made its superintendent and

has developed it very successfully.

A radiogram was received from

WJBU Saturday morming at 2 o'clock.
It stated that reception was clear and
that station announcements were
coming over very distinetly.

The program consisted of musical

out by operator Steve Windes over
WSCFI attracted the attention of
many late hour radio fans to the

on a two-tube set. Other places
heard from are: Millbury, Mass.;

Those in charge of the program
were well pleased with the results
in view of the fact that the night was
a very poor one for broadcasting.

total number of names appearing in
the recent volume of “Who's Who” are

lege. In the report of the number
of holders of bachelor degrees listed
in “Who's Who” from 189 American
colleges, Bucknell 1s credited with
having 37 alumni.

Out of 14 Pennsylvania colleges
included in the report, Bucknell
ranks tenth. The University of
Pennsylvania leads the colleges of
this state with 261 graduates in
“Who's Who.” Harvard is first in
the country ranking, having 1,374
alumni listed.

In another section of the report,
based on the percentages of the num-
ber of living graduates from the
classes of °55 to '30, Bucknel! is in
Béth place, with a percentage of 1.07
of the names in ‘Who's Who.”

“JEEVES” RECEIVES|
HONORABLE MENTION
AT STATE CONTEST

Bucknell Group Group Also Gains
$25 Award For Best
Play Manuscript |

F. AND M. GETS CUP

Winners Give an Adaptation of
Scene From Sheridan’s “School
For Scandal”

That group TT drama-lovers which
migrated to State College tice
and Saturday to offer Chris Kam-
mire’s “Jeeves” in competition for
the annual prize of the Pennsylvania
Inter-collegiate Dramatic Associa-
tion, returned with an award for the
manuseript of the play as well as
honorable mention for the direction
and presentation.

The award of $25 was presented
to the Bucknell group as first prize
in the playwriting contest, which was
held in conjunetion with the dramatic
contest. “Jeeves” was without a
doubt the sprightliest comedy among
the six one-act plays offered during
the two evenings.

Dr. Walter H. Stainton, of the
Cornell department of speech, was
the sole judge for’ the contest. In
his judgment the best play was of-
fered by Franklin and Marshall, who
gave an adaption of the screen scene
from “A School for Scandal.” Penn
State was awarded second prize for
a melodramatic bit entitled “Prayers
for Passel.”

Cap and Dagger and Frill and
Frown’s presentation, under the di-
rection of C. Willard Smith, received
next mention. “Jeeves” was well-
fitted to represent thé final offering
of these two organizations as sep-
arate groups. The entire cast of six
was perfectly chosen, and the per-
formance given by them Friday eve-
ning occasioned more audible pleas-
ure than any other production offer-|m
ed.

Cast Works Together Well

The sparkling humor provided by
the lines was preserved at its maxi-
mum height by the splendid English
reserve displayed .by John James,
*32, in the title role, and by the hap-
py-go-lucky ease of John Anderson,
31, as the young fellow with a na-
ture that is a hangover from his col-
legiate days. The remainder of the
cas, consisting of Franklin Bower, '33
Louise Ziegler, 32, Mary Smith, '32,
and James Lees, ’34, supplied a well-
balanced background for the compli-
cated love affair, which made the ac-
tion quick and convincing.

So enthusiastic is the cast for
“Jeeves” that the players have
agreed to respond to student demand
and will present the play on this
campus during the latter part of
next month. Director Smith, who
has worked with the author of the
comely to make the dialogue as
spontaneous as possible, has also
achieved a smoothness in staging
which more nearly approached pro-
fessionalism than any dramatic of-
fering given here this season.

Present plans of those interested
in drama here call for an evening of
one-act plays, one of which is to be
“Jeeves,” which will be sponsored by
the recently consolidated organiza-
tion of Cap and Dagger. Sigma Tau
Delta, honorary English fraternity,
will sponsor another of the plays, and
Mr. Smith’s class in drama will spon-
sor the third.

All freshman rnies were suspended

for this unusual decision was that the

environment, was a statement made

set by the committee was not reach-
ed, Arthur F. Guldin, '32, chairman
of the executive committee, feels that
the drive was a success.

Included in the amount netted by
the drive is $85.00 which was collect-
ed at a Golden Rule dinner held in
the Women’s College last fall to
raise funds for Bucknell’s educational
project in Brazil. The remainder of
the sum was collected in the present

“The influence of his ‘Decameron,’
to the virtue of which his high rank
is mainly due, has been wide and pro-
found on succeeding literature. The
debt of English writers to him be-
gins with Chaucer, and all succeeding
romancers and novelists have been
directly or indirectly indebted to Boe-
caccio’s work,

“Prose, however, was not his ex-
clusive field. ‘His work determined
the course of the principal streams
of poetry for two centuries after his
lifetime. He was one of the first of
the modern writers to try for the
form and the spirit of the classical
literature.”

The entire examination for asso-|

complete them. This year Bucknell
ranked second among the colleges in
the United States in the number of
applicants for the examination, the

primary purpose in passing the ex-

A TALK TO
~Lewisburg

' Merchants

<
<
Newspapers used to tell their advertising on the basis of 3
circulation alone. Thus it was considered that an advertise- q
ment in a newspaper of 2,000 circulation was worth twice as
much as a similar advertisement in a newspaper with 1,000
circulation. That contention was a fallacy. Newspapers
now recognize and admit it. The thing that makes a news-
paper valuable as an advertising medium is not the size of its
circulation alone, but the quality of that circulation. Papers
that are read by people with money to spendwill sell more for
the advertisers than papers that circulate: ‘almost entirely
among poor people. he
The thing that makes the “Bucknellian" so valuable as a
business getter is the quality of its circulation. It reaches
every one of the r1oo students on the Hill, and most of the
faculty and administration forces. Repeated investigations
have shown that Bucknell students spend about $1,000 a year
each, Where can you find any other large group of people in
or near Lewisburg that spends $1,000 per capita per annum?
There is no such group. Furthermore, these spending stu-
dents are gathered together “Here in Lewisburg.” They are
not scattered over a wide territory or one entire county.
They do not have to make any effort to reach this town.
“They are here.”
If you want to get your share of the million dollars Buck-
nell students have to spend, the way is easy. A “pulling Ad
in the “Bucknellian” will bring the results you want.

GRAUER REPEATS T0
WIN SPRINGTOURNEY

Vogt Beats “Ernie” in Putting
Play-off, as Bucknell Course
Is Formally Opened

Golf formally made its bow into
the sport season here Friday after-
noon, when a series of scheduled
events, which lasted for two days,
were engaged in at the university

golf course.
The first event of the afternoon
was a putting contest, in which
Vogt displaced Ziegler, last year’s
winner, Vogt defeated Grauer in
the playoff.

In the approaching contest Robert
son defeated Grauer in a very close
play, the ball of the latter stopping
on the rim of the cup. Ziegler was
also close on the pin with the other
two players.

Use New Ball

Weber nosed out Ziegler by a very
smal] margin in the driving contest.
A new ball was used for this erent,
and the winning drive resulted in a
235 yard length.

held Saturday afternoon, and was

Kappa Sigs Prove Victims

Of Losing Streak

Some interesting and
baseball was played Monday after-
noon on North Field which resulted
in victories for Beta Kappa, Phi
Lambda Theta, Delta Kappa Phi,
and Kappa Sigma. The victims were
Delta Sigma, Alpha Phi Delta, Non-
Frats, and Phi Kappa respectively.

Beta Kappa secured a_ four-run
lead in the first inning which the
Demies could not overcome. A
three-run rally by the Delta Sigma
team, in the seventh inning, featured
by Jack Younghusband’s home run,
just fell short of netting them a vic-
tory, Beta Kappa winning 6-5. Phi
Lambda Theta took a close game
from Alpha Phi Delta 9-7. Fisher

t shortstop played best for the win-
ners, while Cagnoni put in a good
game for the losers.

Over in the southern corner of the
field, Delta Kappa Phi was running
up the largest score of the season,
lefeating the non-frats 32-2. Every
man on the winning team played
brilliant ball, and several errors by
the losers played an important part
in the large score.

With the opening golf match of
the season scheduled for Saturday
afternoon with Franklin and Marsh-
all, the golf devotees in this section
will witness the first inter-collegiate
game to be played at 2 o'clock upen
the new university golf course.

Bucknell will practically have a
complete veteran line-up, headed by
Graver and Ziegler, winner and run-
ier-up respectively in the opening
tournament last fall. Halicki and
Rebeson will no doubt be on the
team, but the fifth man is still un-
certain. The position will either go)
to Vogt or Weber, both of whom
have showed up well in practice
matches.

The team has been practicing daily
and has been turning in good scores.

GETTYSBURG SOCKS
BISONS IN OPENER

Smothers Snavelymen Under
Barrage of Hits, 13-5,
Friday Afternoon

Gettysburg’s baseball team came
to Lewisburg with a big reputation
and left town Sunday morning with
a greater. one. For they not only
beat Bucknell in a game last Satur-
day afternoon, but also beat one of
the best college pitchers when they
kicked Trudnak all over Loomis field
and finally won out 13-5.

In the first six innings Gettysburg
scored six runs on the same number
of hits. At this point Trudnak left
the game and the Battlefield Bullets
kept up the assault on Kenny, scor-
ing seven more runs in the final
three innings. Four home runs, two
by Enders, and four errors by the
Bisons, aided Gettysburg in its bat-
ting rampage. Dutchak and Wil-
liams, bore the brunt of Bucknell’s
attack, securing five of the team’s
nine hits.

Snavely will have to get a better
combination if he hopes to win many
games this year. The game was the
first of the season for the Bisons, but
it is evident that Trudnak must have
n substitute or two on the trips. The
fielders must play smoother ball and;
the hitters will have to find their eye.

Shower Room Shorts

(By Eugene Sullivan, 32)

It’s not the easiest thing in the
world to try to rechristen a column.
Try it some week when you haven't
much to do. There seemed to be
nothing which all of the spring
sports have in common except the
gathering pace where everyone ends
up after the daily workout. The
shower room is the place where new
and innumerable wise-cracks origi-
nate. It is also the place where the
athletes all “come clean.”

eee e

Alt of the spring activities are
getting under way now. The
trials for the tennis team have
been held. The golf tournament
decided who isto represent Buck-
nell on the first golf team here
to have a course to play on, The
freshman track men have had
their Initial test of the season,
and the varsity track team
swings into action next week.
The baseball team has also made
a start, hut it is doubtful if that
start will lead to anything.

The school lost a good sprint man
when “Bob” Williams left school.
“Beaver” would have accounted for
some points in every mect, as he was

It was too bad that Trudnak

did not get off to a better start

for the season. It was more the

result of poor support than to

any lack of pitching ov the part

of “Trudy” that the gane went

Speaking of tennis courts, the sit-

tically the only way for the average
student to get a court is to either
cut classes all day to wait for a turn
or to stay up all night to get onthem
the next morning. There are four
courts that have been fixed up for
the students, and the varsity tennis
team uses two of these every after-
noon. There should be at lenst
twenty more courts.

BISON CLUB TO MERT
SUSQUEHANNA NINE

Varsity Team Stacks Up Against
Selinsgrove Batters Here Next
Wednesday Afternoon

The varsity nine will play the
second game scheduled for the base-
ball season Wednesday afternoon
with Susquehanna’s crusaders. Coach
Snavely is hoping for a victory in
order to boost the spirit of the
Bisons, who lost their first game at
home to Gettysburg. The game
Wednesday will be the last played in
Lewisburg until May 16.

However, Susquchanna will be no
easy mark. Coach Ullery is bring-
ing a veteran team to Lewisburg
which should play a fast brand of
ball. Either Captain Donnel or
Myers will toe the slab for the eru-
saders, while Trudnak will again take
the mound for Bucknell. In its only
game thus far this season, Susque-
hanna defeated Elizabethtown in
easy fashion 7-4. The Selinsgrove
outfit Is determined to make it two
straight at the expense of the Bisons,
and Bucknell will have to play better
ball than it showed last Saturday in
order to wi.

Coach Snavely is doubtful coneern-
ing his starting line-up. He is seek-
ing a combination which will play er-
rorless ball as well as drive in a
good many runs. Several of last
year’s varsity men who are in col-
lege have not shown any inclination
to try out for the team, and this has
hindered Buckneil from putting its
best team on the field. In all prob-
ability, the line-up will include most
of the starting team against Gettys-
burg.

GRADUATE MANAGER
ANNOUNCES '34 LIST

Frosh Baseball Team Will Have
Five Games, Three at
Home, Two Away

Professor B. W. Griffith, graduate
manager of athletics, released the
freshman baseball schedule yesterday
afternoon. Three of the five games
on the list are scheduled to be play-
ed at home. The other two will be
played at Bellefonte and Bloomsbure
respectively.

In addition to the five games listed
on the schedule, there are two other
fames which may possibly be secured
to round out the schedule.

Material for the freshman nine
has shown up fairly well in practice

jbut the material as a whole is not up

to previous years. Some of the out-
standing candidates for the squad are
Fendrich, Young, and Heydrich,

I pitchers; Cole, James, and Bean, out-

fielders; Uaravaglio, Shiskin, and
Gilliland, outfielders. Ruch seems tc
have the inside track on the ha
stop position.
The schedule follows:

VARSITY TRACKMEN
WORKING OUT DAILY
FOR COMING SEASON

Stiff Program Calls For

Meet Every Three Days
For Three Weeks

TEAMS SHOW UP WELL

The varsity track team, handicap-
ped by a weakness in the sprints and
showing considerable strength in
other events, is working out daily in
anticipation of what will undoubted-
ly prove a tough season.

A meet every three days for three
weeks is the program, with such
teams as Dickinson, Gettysburg and
Lafayette to be met. Captain Henry
Coates will undoubtedly find this
quite difficult, as he is the mainstay
of the team in the middle distances.

“Bud” Wells, who vaulted for the
freshman team last year, is develop-
ing and should account for some
points in every meet. Gene Sullivan,
who vaulted for the varsity last year,
is again out so that the vaulting as-
signments will be pretty well cared
for.

“Ken” Miller and “Sid” Lintz are
showing the best form in the quarter,
with the exception of Coates, who
may run in this distance. In the
fhalf mile, Randall is an almost sure
yunning mate for Coates. Ht is in
this distance that Captain Coates is
expected to show his best form, and
it would not be surprising if a new
school record were hung up.

The weights will find the Bisons
vather weak, but if some of the men
who are expected to come out put in
a belated appearance, this will be
taken care of fairly well.

Tennis and Treasure Hunt
Features of Program

Like Spanish grandees of yore
48 visiting Play Day coeds tore up
the turf between (Harris Hall and the
faculty tennis courts, Saturday, in
search of buried treasure. And like
those very heroes, the heroines dis-
covered no treasure.

But hold! Investigation revealed
that there was treasure buried after
all, The W. A, A. board explained
that the hunters had been looking in
the wrong location; that the loot
would be found somewhere between
Harris Hall and the varsity tennis
courts. In due course, success crown-
ed the lwborer’s efforts.

Hockey, baseball, volley ball, ten-
nis, and individual challenging pre-
ceded the treasure hunt on the Play
Day program, arranged under the di-
rection of “Steve” Williams, '33. A
dinner at the “Sem” concluded the
events.

Purple resumed its royal function
for the day, when the team wearing
that color triumphed over those
wearing green, yellow and blue. The
Bucknell heroines of the meet were:!
Edna Wagner, '32, Constance Bar-
ber, Mabel Lesher, of °38, Millie
Davis and Betty Mayhew, ‘34.

Latest Game is to Prove Sealed |

Heavy Pressure

Down from Hanover, New imp-|
shire, home of the Dartmouth In-
dians, comes word of another game
to be played with the new Camels.

According to the Jack-o-Lantern,
Dartmouth comic magazine, the old
stock tricks and “Things To Do” with
a package of Camels are giving way
to this new game. Most everyone!
has been asked to find the man in!

that the Camel’s tail is also the
lion’s tail). Then, too, counting the
number of e’s on the back of the
package and choosing the coin that |
will just cover the word “cigarettes,”
are other standard Camel parlor
tricks.

Here is the new one, conceived |
with the advent of the cellophane |
wrapper. Place a wager with any of
your friends that you can stand with |
Camels and not break it. You will
vour full weight on a package of

Professor Lewis EK. Theiss spoke
to the students of the Lewisburg
High School at their chapel exercises
on Wednesday morning. The school
authorities have orderded trees and
plants with which to landseape the
high school grounds, and Dr. Theiss
talked about “Trees.”

He first showed the part that trees
play in conserving the rainfall by
holding the water in suspension in
the leaf mold of the forest, whence
it seeps gradually into the springs
and brooks. Then the spenker pie-
tured the influence of trees upon the
economic and industrial life of a na-
tion or community.

Under the title “Geneva—the Melt-
ing Pot of Horticulture,” Dr. Theiss
has ulso published an article in the

Physics To Be Given

In Summer School

W. ON. Lowry Offers Course to Permit
Students to Work off Six-Nour
Requirement More Quickly
The coming Summer Session will}
afford special benefits to pre-med
students. W. N. Lowry, assistant
professor of physics, has consented
to offer a six-hour course in physics,
which will permit students to work

off this requirement more quickly.

By following this policy students
will be able to devote more time in
the regular session to other work.
Following this summer course, the
physics requirement for medical col-
lege may be completed by electing
physics 210, 211, 212, and 213.

Any biological student who has
passed biomathematics is eligible to
take the summer work. Registration
should be made to Professor J. H.

GILRS SOUND SLEEPERS

Women Prove Better Sleepers Than
Men, Recent Experiments Show

Girls are far better sleepers than
men, according to Dr. Donald Laird,
“expert” on the subject of sleep and
professor of psychology at Colgate
University, where a recent sleep sur-
yey was held.

An inter-collegiate good sleep con-
test was held between the men at
Colgate and the women at Skidmore
college.

Resulting figures showed that girls
have less trouble going to sleep, wake
up fewer times during the night, are
less restless, and have fewer dreams.

In addition, fewer girls have to be
called twice in the morning and in
general feel more peppy and less
grouchy and are less foggy mentally
in the morning.

Prof, Laird attributes this to the
theory that members of the feminine
sex are neither as active physically
or mentally as men.

“Only four hours may be sufficient

Had Contained Clothes
Of Both Men

WERE AT PRACTICE

There is many a man walking the
streets these days with his entire
wardrobe upon his baek. but there|
are none so near the extremities of
nudeness as Del McGue, husky U. rom
lL. A. gridman, and his fellow player,
Joe Keebles, according to the Cali-
fornia Daily Bruin.

A short week ago, the two pigskin
wrestlers -prided themselves on pos-
sessing everything that should be in
the wardrobe of the well-dressed col-
legian; today they walk the streets,|
the wind whipping the few scant gar-
ments that now remain between them
and the cold, cold world.

Tt seems that Del and Joe spent
the week-end at Catalina, enjoying a!
much-needed rest from the worries of}
the gridiron. Returning last Mon-
day, the two football men spent the
afternoon in honorable toil on the}
field, their entire worldly possessions,
as far as raiment was concerned, |
eached in a suitcase resting in the
back of Del’s ear. Returning, as
dusk settled, to clothe themselves for
their evening entertainment, they
reached for the bag. The suitcase
was gone.

BARNARD WOMEN
[URGE NEW SYSTEM

Condemn Method of Marking
By Grades in Petition
To Acting-Dean

Although no official action has been
taken, the agitation at Barnard Col-
lege over the existing system of re-
eording grades, reached a crisis last
weck when a student petition de-
manding the abolition of the present
system and the substitution of the
puss-fail system was presented to
acting-Dean George W. Mullins.

The Bulletin, the undergraduate
publication, has for some time been
carrying on editorially a campaign
in fvor of the pass-fail system, and
finally a student curricular commit-
tee drew up the petition condemning:
the system in use. That the giving]
of definite marks leads students to
concentrate too much on grades alone
and that the distribution of A’s and

|B’s varies disproportionately in the

\urious classes is the basis on whieh
the signers of the petition place their
argument,

Sigma Tau Delta Will Give
“Park 4002,” By Haynes
And John James

Bucknellians will have thelr first
opportunity to attend an evening of
plays written by student authors on
May 21, when a local little theatre
group will stage three of the one-act
dramas submitted in the Theta Alpha
Phi contest in the Lewisburg high
school auditorium.

“Jeeves” the rollicking comedy by
“Chris” Kammire, '31, which received
first prize in the local contest, and
which also took the award in the
playwriting contest sponsored by the
Inter-collegiate Dramatic Associa-
tion at Penn State, will be presented
by its original cast.

Sigma Tau Delta, honorary Eng-
lish fraternity, will sponsor the real-
istic play “Park 4002” by Kenneth
Haynes, "31, and John James, '32,
which ran a close seeond to “Jeeves”
in the Theta Alpha Phi contest, Its
merit lies in its skillful character
portrayal. Dr. H. W. Robbins will
be faculty advisor for this one-act
drama.

. “Women Come Back”

The third original production which
will complete this program of one-
act plays is “‘Women Come Back” by
Eunice Swan, '33. This highly mod-
ernistic ex®ursion into the sup.rna-
tural will be presented as the offer-
ing of the little theater group which
has been organized from C. Willard
Smith’s class in dramatic interpreta-
tion.

Professor Smith is acting as re-
gisseur of this little theater group.
This is the first year that the course
in drama has strayed from the for-
midable study of stage theory..to fn-
clude any practical work along this
Une. In aceordance with thfs plan,
members of the class under Prof.
Smith’s direction, have taken upon
themselves ‘the various jobs entailed
in such production.

Assume Jobs

Trennie E. Eisley, '31, is acting as
business manager; James B. Steven-!

LATEST BELLE HOP
SATIRIZES “LIBERTY”

\
Chris Kammire Promises Very
Faithful Imitation of
Popular Magazine

When the Belle Hep is circulated
about the campus on Saturday it
will resemble very strongly that
popular little weekly which boasts
2,500,000 readers, each week. In
short, the staff members of the cam-
pus periodical have devised a take-off
on Liberty Magazine. :

Editor Chris Kammire says that
the burlesque of the more widely-
known periodical is a very faithful
one. The likeness of the two carries
over from the cover design on the
front to the cigarette advertisement
on the back.

“Lil” Satirized

Leslie Thrasher, the ereator of
“For the Love ’o Lil,” will find his
work beautifully satirized. From this
point on the reader will find articles
and departments of the “mag” that
are planned solely to amuse Bueck-
nellians, ’

There will be a short short story
by a practically unknown = author.
Bright sayings of children will es-
pecially amuse many of the colleg-
jang here. And, of course, the dur-
lesque would not be complete without
a “Vox Pop.”

The last issue of the Belle Hop, to
be published next month, promises
to be equally amusing and quite a bit
more personal, This publi¢ation will
be the Rateo number, for which the
staff of the “Hop” is sending out an
urgent appeal to all would-be “trick”
photographere.

Eighth Inning Rally in Game
Yesterday, Gives Bisons
Victory, 11 to 6

TRUDNAK SCATTERS HITS

Behind some consistent pitching by
Trudnak, Bucknell’s baseball team
cked out its first victory of the sea-
Susquehanna’s Crusaders
The contest was de-
rally by the

son over
yesterday 11-6.
cided by a five-run
Bisons in the cighth inning.

Trudnak and “Lefty” Young were
the stars of the gume, the former
pitching a brilliant game, and Young
fielding perfeetly and securing three
hits in his first collegiate game.
Bucknell was off to an early lead
when hits by Trudnak, Young, and
Williams, combined with several er-
rors by Susquehanna’s infield, earned
four runs in the second inning.

Crusaders Tie Score

The Crusaders soon managed to
tie the seore by virtue of two walks,
an error, and a few opportune hits.
In the last half of the eighth, the
Bisons put the game on ice, counting
five times. A triple by “Charley”
Mills, with two men on the paths,
was the feature of the rally.

Bucknell showed some very snappy
playing in this contest. Both Coach
Snavely and the team were hearten-
ed hy the victory, and are confident
of many victories this season. The
Bisons secured cleven runs. on ten
hits and six errors by Susquehanna.

Stroup, first baseman of the Selins-
grove aggregation, was the biggest
offender, having three errors charged
to his record. Malasky sturred for
the Crusaders getting two hits and
fielding his outfield pogition in splen-
did style. Vetter and Trudnak shared
hitting honors with Young; each
making two bingles.

TRIP OF B.U. STUDENTS

Sixteen Biologists to Make Tour,
Sunday of Natural History
Museum and Zoology Aquarium

DR. NORMAN STEWART
LEADER OF THE PARTY

, The American Museum of Natural
History and the Aquarium of the
New York Zoological Society, in Bat-
tery Park, will be the main objectives
of a trip which will be made to New
York Sunday by the students in ver-
tebrate zoology and invited guests, |
under the leadership of Dr. Norman
Hi. Stewart.

Sixteen biologists will take the
annual excursion to the metropolitan
institutions to see the colossal col-
leetions, especially those on paleon-
tology. The trip has as its objec-
tive the familiarization of the stu-
dent with much of the American
source material in the field, and with
museum and other educational nreth-
ods.

At the American Museum of Na-
tural History, where the party will
spend a considerable portion of its
time, the students will probably cen-
ter their attention upon the fossil re-
mains of the vertebrates, particularly
those of the huge dinosaurs of the
Mesozoic period and of the prehis-
teric human forms.

Fishes of Interest

The living fishes of the Battery
Park Aquarium will absorb another
portion of the visit. The varied col-
lection of the lower vertebrates will
provide interesting stidy material
for the systematic zoologists. The
group will not be able to visit the
Bronx Zoological Gardens «ue to the
shortness of their sojourn in the city.

It will, however, include in its
itinery, the New York Central us|
brary, the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, the campus of Columbia Uni-
versity, and the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine. The party will be a
ducted through the several chapels 6f
the latter, and will attend the after-
noon services there.

Plans for the Inter-fraternity Ball!
tomorrow evening are complete, Ned
Raker, '31, chairman of the commit-
tee, announced today. Tal Henry
and his popular North Carolinians
are expected to draw a record crowd
at this annual event.

The majority of freshmen will be
barred from this social event, since
they may not be considered as fra-
tcrnity members. It has been e-
cided that only two from each fra-
ternity will be permitted to attend.

To Decorate Tustin

Attractive programs have been se-
cured for the dance, which promises
to be a colorful affair. Tustin gym-
nasium will be elaborately decorated
in gay colors, each fraternity having
a private booth. Tal Henry's Vic-
tor Recording Orchestra, a national-
ly known organization, recently made
several vitaphone pictures for Warn-
er Brothers. These musicians scored
a big hit at the Inter-fraternity Ball
at Penn State two weeks ago.

Guests at the dance will include:
President and Mrs. Emory W. Hunt,
Dean Amelia E. Clark, Dean- and
Mrs. Romeyn Rivenburg, Dean and
Mrs. J. Hillis Miller, Professor and
Mrs. W. C. Johnson, and Professor
and Mrs. C. E. Burgee.

BIOLOGISTS TO MAKE
JUNE WATER SURVEY

Will Make Intensive Inspection
Of White Deer Creek
And Water Sheds

SHORT TRIP LAST WEEK

A group of student bacteriologists
under the direction of Dr. John W.
Rice, professor 6f bacteriology, will
make a difficult and extensive water
survey of White Deer Creek in the
ten-day period immediately follow-
ing Commencement. The party will
undertake the survey in cooperation
with the White Deer Water Company
and officials of the state department
of health.

The survey will be the second one
made this year hy students in the de-
partment of biology. Elaborate
equipment will be needed for this
project, in view of the size of the
stream,

New Cultures Needed

As no material for cultures has
been taken there previously, new
media will have to be secured. To-
ward that end an incubator and other
equipment will be employed. The
bacteriologists hope to be able to
sterilize and clean petri dishes in the
field to make the survey more effee-
tive.

The first survey made this year
was held Thursday and Friday under
the direction of Pr. Riee. Dean
Amelia E. Clark and Miss Franees
Davis acted as chaperones for the!
party, which included 17 students.

The group worked upon the water-
shed of Spruce Run, a stream run-
ning parallel to White Deer Creek.
Taking samples of the water of all
the tributaries of the run and ex-
amining the sanitary features of the
hunting eamps above it, the bacteri-
ologists found that while the streams
were lower than usual, the bacterial
counts were very low. , al

The members of the’ party found
three beaver dams along the run
with fresh cuttings at each. They
also inspected the new chloramine
process of water purification in use|
by the water company.

Meetings Fairly Certain

There was some doubt on the cam-
pus whether or not class meetings
for the purpose of nomination would
be called this year. Many students
held that the clique nominations wer>
sufficient, but hig Bucknell politicans
thought that democracy should be
given a chance, so it is now fairly
certain that all meetings wil) he
called. P

The lineup of fraternity cliques is
the same as last year, but in the wo-
men’s college, political shifts have
been made. There Pi Beta Phi, Del-
ta Delta Delta, and Alpha Chi Omega
are opposing Kappa Delta, Delta
Zeta, Sigma Sigma Delta, and Phi
Mu. Since women are given only
class secretariats, inter-sorority poli-
tics don’t mean a great deal.

Probable Candidates

The following are the probable
candidates for class offices, together
with the initials of the fraternity of
each candidate: f

Charles Titus, '31, president of the
inter-fraternity baseball league, de-
sires the managers of the winning
fraternity teams to let him know the
results of the games as soon as pos-

FINAL C. C. MEETING

Last Gathering of Year This Evening
In The Baptist Church

Campus Club meetings for the
present season will close this evening
following the musical program offer-
ed at 8 o’clock in the Baptist church
by Mrs. Vera MacCreadie and Miss
Charlotte Armstrong. Selections
will consist of organ and violin num-
bers.

““Scotty’’ Whyte Advocates Exercise

Playing golf, believes Professor
James P. Whyte, is one of the best
means of recuperating from illness.
Since his return from hospital circles
to more académic pursuits, he has
been “exercising” religiously on the

TX! university links.

So successful has been his return
to health that “Scotty” has offered
this suggestion to Dr. George B. Law-
son, the Brattleboro patient just re-
cently returned. "Now, George, what
you need is exercise,” we suspect
him of saying.

“George,” we understand, is ,will-
ing but is holding off for a while
longer on the belief that a “drive”
might be a bit too strenuous at this
particular stage of his recuperation.

While Doctor Lawson Takes Rest

The two professors will have to con-
tent themselves with comparing oper-
ations until a more propitious mo-
ment arrives.

As an additional method of getting
inte form again, “Pro” Whyte has
taken over two of his public speaking
classes. For talking, he believes, is
another important form of exercise.
“Too many people neglect the most
natural thing in the world.”

On the other hand report has it
that right now Professor “Henry
James” Lawson is glorying in a com-
plete rest from all exercise, and,
contrary to “Scotty’s” philosophy
will refrain from classroom work
until he ean definitely detach mind
from body.

“The humanitarianism of the Dr.

Faustus legend has been the reason |

for its almost universal appeal,” sald
Mrs. Sprague. “It represents the
human striving after an ideal.

“Goethe has given a version great-
ly different in interpretation and in
story from that known by English
speaking peoples, who know best the
version written by Marlowe.

“Goethe was the most intellectual
author of the early nineteenth cen-
tury and his work has had a large
influence. His version of the legend
was made the basis of one of Gov-
nod’s operas.”

“You can’t'do missionary ,work by
turning up your nose to an angle of
180 degrees,” was the terse.state-
ment which Dr. Paul W. Harrison,
noted author and missionary, gave in
freshman chapel Monday in his
speech on “Methods of Missionary
Work.”

Dr. Harrison gave a vivid deserip-
tion of missionary life in Arabia,
stressing the point that cooperation
is one of the essentials of a suecess-
ful missionary life. “One cannot
force religion down a man’s throat,”
he said. “Missionary work depends
upon making oneself one of the
people with whom you are working.

“The missionary learns his duties
by being one of the crowd. Arabial§
ean most certainly cure one of such
a thing as pathological fastidious-| °
ness. Eating roasted locusts helps;
to rid one of this so-called fastidious-
ness.” Dr. Harrison coneluded by
stressing the importance of mission-
ary work to the modern world.

Dr. Emory Hunt will deliver the
fifth of the series of rational relig-
jous talks tomorrow in the same
chapel. The subject of this talk,
which will be mainly religious in
nature, is “The Social Kingdom.”

It is strange, indeed, Bucknell's
disciplinary system. We have neither
the honor system nor campus police-
men or proctors; we have, if many
students are to be believed, a very
bad blend of the two—a monstrous |
hybrid.

All students know that some from
their number are “turned up” from
time to time and are charged with
having broken various college rules.

charges are based is often gathered

No thrill ern be greater than the
thrill which comes to a wireless oper-
ator when he hears an SOS at sea.
The situation is tense; the several
hundred land and ship operators on
duty hunch over their apparatus,
with the headphones clamped tightly
on, straining their ears forthe slight
est bit of code, the transmitter ready
for instant use, and usually, the pile
of cigarette stubs mounting higher
and higher in the ash tray.

less messages relative to an SOS at
sea were experienced by ‘‘Steve”
Wincles, '33, in the early evening, a
few days ago. When he heard the
broadcasting stations shutting down
for “a distress call at sea,” he hur-
ried to. the amateur radio room in
Fast College and listened in on the

Is Of Newfoundland

The scene of difficulty was east of
Newfoundland and consequently the
land stations along the Atlantic sea-
board were having great difficulty in
copying the distress messages and
only snatches of the conversation:
could be heard at Lewisburg.

The first “QRT” had evidently been
sent at about 7:20, and for awhile
everybody was telling everybody else
to “QRT” (stop sending immediate-
ly). Wireless traffic is usually very
heavy in the early evening, so quiet-
ing the air was no easy job. Every
minute or so some ship, oblivious: of
the fact that an SOS had been sent,
would “open up” and call a land sta-
tion, saying “hr” or “TFC,” mean-
ing (1 have a message for you).

Professor James VP. Whyte, 4s
judge for the sophomore — public
speaking contest held Tuesduy after-
noon in Bucknell ‘Hall, selected Ed-
mund A. Smith as the individual to
receive the award in September.
The contest, which was open to all

there were Judson KE. Ruch, Meyer
H. Ginsberg,and Chester D. Owens,
| allof whom closely followed Smith in
| the excellence of their presentations.

Interfraternity Politles Subject

Smith’s subject dealt with “inter-
| fraternity politics.” and it was de-
livered in a thoughtful and well-pre-
pared manner that was not so dis-
tinctly evident in the offerings of |
the other‘competitors. The speeches
were delivered from a previously
prepared outline of a developed sub-
ject chosen by the contestant.

A prize was also offered for wo-
men in the sophomore class who!
wished to compete. There was no}
response from this quarter, however.
This is the second year that no wo-
men have offered to contest for the
prize. Trofessor Whyte says that if
such.is the case next year this par-/

Coach “Mal” Musser will take his
yearling squad to Bellefonte Satur-

Academy's crack baseball team. Last
season Bellefonte had a fine team,
and sinee its team this year is almost
the same, the freshmen will have to
{play a flashy hrand of ball in order

The starting line-up for the fresh-
men is as yet doubtful. Coach Mus-
ser has not had enough time to
choose the best men for the positions.
“Ed” Fendrich will probably take
the mound for the Bisons, with Ruch
behind the plate. Fendrich seems in
as good shape as last year when he
made the All-Jersey scholastic base-
ball team. Ruch is also an experi-
enced man, so the battery will be in{
safe hands. Heydrich, another hurl-j

Weber, the fifth man and a new-

somewhat of a surprise, as the F.

three points, and Lafayette has ons
of its best teams in years. The La-
fayette team will be met here next

The frosh track team goes to
Kingston on Saturday for its second
meet of the season. The strong Wy-

position for an equally powerful
Bison squad.

The yearling track and field as-
pirants have been showing more
ability than any frosh squad at Buck-
nell in recent years. Forrest Priest,
jnterseholnstic javelin champion, is i
consistent point scorer and  should|
win his event with ease. Meyers and
Bean will be hard to beat in the
jumps, as they have both been get-
ting about 20 feet in the broad
jumps, while Bean is clearing the bar
at about five and a half in the high
jump.

Simonson May Repeat

Simonson, who takes care of the
quarter mile asslgnments, won his
event in the Susquehanna meet, and
bids fair to repeat at Seminary. In
the middle and long distance = run
there is no way of telling the
strength of the Bison contenders.

division Kubacki is the mainstay of

“The Story of Religion” by our good friend and fellow
Bucknellian, Chas. Francis Potter, ‘07, pastor of the First Hu-
manist Society of New York, is a story of assorted creeds and
beliefs. The major portion of the book is given over to Theism
and Christianity. Biographical studies of numerous Christian
characters from New Testament times up to the present are
given. We knew the author intimately—as a fine Christian fel-
low in his college days.

But in many ways the subject matter is disappointing.
Someone has taken away his Lord and given him a mess of New
Thought Hash for his birthright. “Charley” has discovered
that all great religious leaders have experienced a “Theophany.”
and therefore all religions are somewhat equally superstitious
and based on mental hallucination. In visions of the night he
has seen the future religious leader analyzing personality by test
tubes, and with instruments of precision weighing and measur-
ing the things of the Spirit. We can readily understand why
the Humanist, having discarded the worthwhile beliefs of Im-
mortality and the Supernatural, is looking for his god in a micro-
scope. Such a little god couldn’t be found anywhere else.

Thus the paths of roommates separate. In our religious be-
liefs there is a great gulf fixed between us. In our personal re-
lations there will always be room at the Inn for our distinguish-
ed and brilliant pal of “Sweet Sixteen,” East Wing.

We are numbered with the old-fashioned folks of the
Christian faith; we readily admit we play an outfield position.
too dumb to believe in anything else than in the foolishness of
preaching.

Is Outspoken Citizen

Dr. West is now at bat in the pulpit of the Lewisburg Bav-
tist Church and we are going to tell you what kind of a batter he
is. Raymond West came from the farm with a rich heritage
from his parents of good health, ambition, and religious ideals.
They have brought him more home runs than Babe Ruth. Buck-
nell University and Crozier Theological Seminary were out-
standing hits, with all the bases full of scholastic honors, stu-
dent activities, and moral leadership. In his long, useful life he
has been pastor of several outstanding churches and held many
positions of official importance in the Baptist denomination. He
has traveled this continent many times in all directions: his ac-
quaintances are numbered by the thousands, and like Paul of
Tarsus, the solicitude for old friends in all the churches is still
part of his self-assumed duties. An expert in the matter of the
World Court and Peace on Earth, he has traveled’ abroad in its
further study and has delivered a great many lectures on the
problem of World Peace. Continuously sought as a speaker,
broadminded and progressive, he has always been a denomina-
tional leader and an outspoken citizen in the communities he has
served. A strong man is not only known by his friends, but
also by his enemies and perhaps the truest judgment comes from

friendly critics, :

Dr. West has the same breed of enemies that any live
preacher acquires. “Great is Diana of the Ephesians” has al-
ways been the battle cry of large-vested interests in questionable
enterprises whose prosperity has been threatened by the gospel
of righteousness and morality. .It is impossible for the preacher
“to mind his own business and preach religion” without butting
in on corrupting influences in the community. To make the
Kingdoms of this world the Kingdoms of our Lord, all unright-

| eousness and selfishness must be pointed out and destroyed by rt
a healthy Christian sentiment. Miilitary diplomacy, economic Supplies

the shafts of the preacher. To preach the word, be urgent in 5 ——
and out of season: to reprove, rebuke, and exhort is the preach-
er’s job. Dr. West has not failed in any of these respects and
there are plenty who just don't seem to like him.

When the writer once asked Dean Phillips whom he would
suggest among his acquaintances for a minister of the local Bap-
tist Church, he replied that he wouldn’t recommend it to his bit-
terest enemy. In other words, it is a difficult pulpit to All.

Dr. West Builds Up Baptist Church

A good friend is said to be one who knows all about you and
still likes you. The people of the Baptist Church know Dr.
West as a good neighbor by the side of the road. They know
his good points, his weak points, and know that the former far
outweigh the latter. They know if someone is neglected in the
daily ministrations of pastoral calls, they also know many who
are regularly visited; they know that your contribution in no
way affects his interests in you, for he purposely avoids that in-
formation; they know that always your attendance is rewarded
by an excellent sermon, that if too much stress is laid on some = | -———

gogical doctrine. A suggestion to a member of the faculty to
see things through his spectacles reminds us that he is a mem-
ber of the Board of Trustees of Bucknell University and only
exercising his dutics as he sees them.

The College Inn spokesman has traveled far and worship-
ped in many places. He has known a good many ministers, and
numbers many priests and even bishops in his acquaintances.
Two summers at Northfield gave him acquaintances with many
men of international prominence in religious leadership. With-
out boasting, he knows a good preacher when he sees one. The
Lewisburg Baptist Church in the quality of its preaching, in its
superb choir, in its beautiful architecture and fine equipment, in
its kindhearted but not gushing fellow members, has made other
places less attractive. For twenty years he has wended his way
there steadily every Sunday with rare exceptions. Even T-Bone
and Teddy, the Jonathan and David canine comrades of their
own volition, are generally waiting outside for the benediction
Lewisbare. Pa, and their meal ticket friend. He has justifiable pride in his
membership there and feels that even the smallest official posi-
tion isa high honor. He has little apologies for its membership
and is proud of its $10,000 budget and its generous contributors.
Under Dr. West's pastorate $40,000 have been spent in improve-
ments and redecorations. If its membership is of a higher caste
in social prestige and its I, Q’s. a little above the average, that is
nothing to criticize, but an inspiration to other churches.

Influence at Bucknell Great

The Lewisburg Baptist Church has a distinguished and
honorable history. Its pastor is second only to the President of
Bucknell in his influence in the community. Even then, only by
an act of courtesy is he of secondary influence, for by reason of
pride in her first born son, Bucknell University, she has humbled
| herself that her offspring might increase while she decreased in
| importance. She gave birth to the College, housed it, nourished
| and brought it safely to manhood, a very sturdy son indced. She
has a moral right to protest if grievous wolves shail enter and
spoil it through false philosophy or vain deceit.

PURDUE'S STUDENT COUNCIL
ABOLISHES CLASS OFFICERS

All class officers as they now exist
on the Purdue campus were abolished
recently by the Student Council. The
duties of the class officers have seen
placed with various other university
groups, and only one office, that of
the freshman class treasurer, has
heen retained. The treasurer, as is
the custom now, will serve for four
years. Committees which are now
appointive will be clective in the
future,

The action by the Council Jast week
came about after discussion of the
present system had been carried on
all year,

OF CONFERENCE WORK|

Dr. John W. Rice will be an active

him to Syracuse, New York, from
Tuesday until Saturday. As a rep-
resentative of Bucknell at the con-
ference, Dr. Rice will serve on the
committee concerning health curricu-
Jums. :

There are four divisions to the con-
ference, each section of which will |
— its solutions to various prob- |
lems to the entire body of the meet- |
ing. The purpose of this gathering ||
is to “focus attention on the basic}
problems of college hygiene, to an-/|
alyze these problems, and to formu-
late conclusions.”

Dr. Rice has recently received his | §
commission as second lieutenant in
the Sanitary Reserve Corps in the
United States army. The commis-
sion was granted in view of Dr.

“HBLL WEEK" ANTICS ¢

Phi Psi, Phi ; Gach, Sigma chi, |i

Victims of Hazing

PRIDE SUFFERS

The proverbial “hell week,” with

all the horrors it entajls for the
freshmen, has at least partially put
in its appearance. The pledgemen|
of Phi Psi, Phi Gam, Sigma Chi, S.
A. F., and Delta Sig seem to he hav-
ing a hard time of it.

Bottle hunts in the wee
the morning, queer and
“house duties,” eecentrie and
tracted studies of tomb stone in-
scriptions, visits and “hunts” in out-|
Jandish locales, characterize only in
part the activities.

No small purt in these have the
“special” hazing parties, whose im-
portance in this week-of-weeks looms
large. Splintered paddles, sore ex-
tremities, hurt prides, and exercise |
for the actives, are important ele- |
ments in this phase of the pedagogi-
ea) process.

Yes, yes, “It’s a great life if you
don’t weaken, it’s a great life if you
do weaken.” Those freshmen who
manage to finish the course will only
consider it part of their duty to keep
up the “grand old custom.”

AUTHORITIES CONDEMN
MEN’S DORMITORY BEDS
BOUGHT LAST SUMMER

It has been reported that the new
beds, which the university purchased
last summer for the men’s dormi-
torics, have been condemned by the
officials in charge.

A marked sagging has been
noticed in the underneath portion of
the equipment. ‘Judging by the wear
the beds have shown in their first
year of service, the authorities are
pessimistic concerning their ‘lasting
quality.

Those in charge hope that a set-
tlement may be made with the manu-
facturers nnd that new beds may be
installed by the opening of the next
school year.

During the short musical program
to be given tomorrow in upperclass
chapel by the sympheny urchestra

five men from the orchestra will be
presented with keys for service in

The musical portion of the pro-
gram will consist of several numbers

women's glee club, as well as volun-
teers from the various sororities.
The entire group will conclude the

chestra, led by Mr. Gies, will accom-

this afternoon for the  all-student

sing whieh is to be held early Mon-
day evening on the campus in front

part of the program will proceed as
soon as a crowd has gathered.

MAKE NEW YORK TOUR

{Group Under Dr. Norman H. Stewart
Visits Aquarium, Museems
And New Cathedral

Making a trip through New York,
visiting prominent institutions, 17
students in vertebrate zoology under
the direction of Dr. Norman H.
Stewart, gathered biological) data
Sunday.

The group visited the Battery Park
Aquarium, the Metropolitan, Museum
of Fine Arts, the American Museum
of Natural History, the New York
Central Library, and the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine.

The greatest portion of the group's

| time was spent in the Aquarium and

the American Museum, where ex-
hibits of greatest biological interest
were centered. ‘However, the group
arranged for a private tour through
the massive chapels of the slowly
rising cathedral. Each member of
the party received a smal) medallian
bearing the image of the building.

BIG YEAR

Impressive is the summary of its
year’s activities that the Y. M. C. A.
has just issued. It brings striking-
ly to mind the great deal of truly
educative work that that organiza-
tion is doing on this campus. Each
year the “Y” is making itself more
useful; at present, it is responsible
for much of the better extra-currica-
lar work done here, and the results
of this labor are, on the whole, high-
y commendable

Good speakers, thought-provoking
conferences, a fraternity pledge din-
ner, student-faculty conferences—all
these are included in the list of what
the “Y” has done this year. It is to
be hoped that 1931-32 will be just a
uccessful, and that the Y. M. C. A.
will coniinue to hold the respect of
tudent body an
> deservedly won,

COMMON NUISANCE

Advices from the infirmary are to
the effect that the various fraternity
hell weeks this year have not been
so hard on students as in times past.
Nevertheless, some undergraduates
had to be put on the sick list—one
especially needed urgent first aid—
all because of these little outbursts
of prep schoo] nonsense.

Although hell week is primarily a
fraternity matter, it is a common
nuisance, and should be dealt with
as such by those who are old enough
to know better. No arguments that
it is excellent for freshman disci-
pline, or that it adds prestige to a
fraternity, can hold weight with stu-
dents who think the matter through
and realize that it is nothing more
than a form of moronic rowdyism.

Fach year the Bucknellian hope-
fully awaits the day when one of the
leading fraternities will come out an:
announce that it has cast hell week
aside and wi treat its future
brothers as gentlemen «and not a
trained bears. Should that happen,
other Greeks would be foreed to fol-
low suit.

Tf the hours wasted in one fra-
ternity in preparing for and carry-
ing through hell week were devoted
to study, the scholastic standing of
that fraternity, no matter how high,
would he noticeably raised. Even
put on extra-curricular activities, the
time would be much better spent.

LITTLE MARKS

Tn calling attention to the fact that
the college year is rapidly drawing
to a close, the Temple University
News editorially comments:

“The dizzy pace of campus and
classroom events should be halted
mentally by each individual for a
moment's calm survey of the few
remaining weeks of this semester,
with a particular view to planning
in detail the scholastic work.
final analysis, the only permanent
paper record of a successful college
year is the tale told hy each )ittle
mark on the report card.

“Tt will not be dificult to get lost

wide elections, annual banquets.

assignments, and daily work, The
period is a “gold test” of stamina
and control in undergraduates, now
another vear nearer the coveted de-
gree, and for seniors, approaching
their journey’s end.”

The meat of that verbage lies in
the last sentence of the first para-
graph—“each little mark on the re-
port eard.” And then, ff in four
years one amasses enough neat little
marks, one receives a piece of paper
on which appear some queer looking
letters.

Must everything in college be
sacrificed to acquire those “neat little
}marks?” Are they our goal? The
femphasis placed on them in most
universities, including Bucknell,
would lead one to think so.

crass and material in their worship,
but we are afraid they hold sway
here. We wish we could say, “For-
get them,” but their hold is too
strong.

A TRIBUNAL DUTY

The freshmen are not to be blamed
if they turn on the dictatorial sopho-
| mores next Thursday evening and re-
turn in kind the treatment they have
had for cight months past. As long
as we have freshman rules, Move Up
day practices are what naturally can
be expected from the suddenly freed
under-dogs. And too, Move Up day
comes as 2 welcome interlude in the
jast hard grind of the college year.

But it is up to the Senior Tribunal
to see that this interlude is not turn-
ed into an orgy. The Tribunal ought
to be responsible for seeing that the

fun does not begin till after supper,| When in good old

and not in the morning, as it did last
year.

Knowing the efficient way that the
Tribunal has done its work this
year, we can rest assured that Move
Up day will he carried through in
proper style.

Lest the hitherto amicable rela-
tions of townspeople and students be-
come disrupted over a small matter,
the Backnellian wishes to call to the
attention of the worthy citizens of
Lewisburg a complaint that some
professors and undergraduates have
against them. The other day, when
came students wanted to use the ten-
n purts on North field, they found
of the cight courts monopo-
lized by townspeople who did not
eem to have slighest desire to
share them

Tfad this been the first time such
1 thing had happened, the matter
might have been overlooked, but it
was grievance of long standing
and gave rise to hard feelings.

The Bucknellian does not wish to
see the local citizenry denled
privilege of the courts. For that
reason it hopes that students will be
accorded a little more consideration
when they find time for a few sets of
tennis. After all, it was primarily
for the benefit of undergraduates
that the courts were provided. Local
Tildens and Lenglens have their big
|chance {n June after the university
has closed its doors.

Personal Opinion

URGES HILL POST OFFICE
To The Editor:

lam nearing the end of four years
spent as a student at Bucknell and
have come to the conclusion that col-
lege life consists, for the main part,
in toting one laundry bag after an-
other downtown and back up the
Hill, not to mention countless trips
to the postoflice in quest of mail.

A new penitentiary is in process
near Lewisburg; the officials and in-
mates will undoubtedly have their
mail delivered to them. Couldn't
some arrangements be made to have
mail delivered to students on the
Hill?) Not that it is painful to carry
laundry bags, but it Is a blamed
H nuisance,

A branch post office could be in-
stalled on the Hill with boxes and
parcel post window for the conveni-
ence of students. Twice daily a ear-
rier delivers mail to the college and
as often takes mail away. Why not
; make a good job of it?

Shortly, a new Federal Building
will be built «at Third and Market.
Arrangements should be made to

“STUDENTS TELL ALL”
To The Fditor: |
The Bucknellian is to be congrat-
julated. At last it has succeeded in
| arousing a certain element of the stu-
|dent group out of its ‘moronic leth-
argy. The editorial on stool pigeons
has accomplished the impossible.
Students who have been dead to all
other campus questions have sudden-
|ly become orators and defenders of
personal liberty. Their cry is: “Down
|with the stool pigeons.”

Without taking time to
facts and circumstances; without
‘even a superficial analysis of the
‘question, these students have unani-
|mously accepted the idea that there
lare stool pigeons at Bucknell. Their |
ichildish minds rejoice at the thought. |

They take pride in pointing out |
the individuals who are supposed to |
be secretly supplying information
for the common purpose of destroy-
ing ingenuous students, who by their |
innocent and cultured actions have
made themselves unworthy of the|
privilege of attending an institution |
where the finer qualities of life =|
fostered.

Yet these same students are the|
jones. who after an escapade of da- |
|bauchery, feel that it is necessary
for their integrity and reputation to
broadeast the details to the four!
winds. If anything were to be su-
perfluous, it would be to have stool
pigeons at Bucknell.

Stool pigeons give information
about people who are careful not to
let others know their business. Why,
then, have stool] pigeons at Bucknell,
| where one’s chief ambition is to let
others know his business, especially
if it is of a shady character?

The situation is not a light one.
Many students who prefer to live «
| quiet and sedate life have become
targets of vile insinuations. Per-

All I know is what my fraternity
brothers tell me. 1 come up to the
house yesterday and got into an ar-
gument about campus politics. Seems
that some of the boys were sore be-
cause the clique hadn’t given them
much this year, only a vice president
of the sophomore class or something
like that. As usual, when all the
talking was over nothin’ had been
decided, but that’s all right. Talk-
ing politics don’t do no harm, for
unemployment is so bad that when
most fellows graduate the only posi-
tions they can get are school-teachin’
jobs or fillin’ vacancies in Congress
left by dry Senators that have died
of acute alcoholism.

AMONG THE BOOK STALLS

has just
come off the Harper press, and
the two contributors from Bucknell
have just reeeived their comple-
mentary copies, modestly bound in
black. Grace Link and Owen Sad-
dler have both done n philosophical
bit in the volume that makes the
reader think a moment before turn-
ing those particular pages.

All of the poems in this anthol-
ogy are short, and likewise all are
dedicated to collegiate consump-
tion. They are fresh, moving, and
full of stirring life. Ané@ since it
is the first poetien] volume which
combines all these attributes, it is
well worth your having.

Soon this $2 book will be sold on
the campus by a student represen-
tative. If you are still in doubt as
to whether you should indulge in
a copy, just borrow one and read
Christopher Morley’s preface. It's
great!

Tn an enchanting paragraph con-
cerning the experience of the writ-
ers in this book he says: “They
have visited museums and librar-
ies, seen ‘the curving backs of
trains, and cattle with frost on
their chins, said goodbyes, cursed
God, and thought a good deal about
death and corruption.”

A column was given over to this
book Monday in the Public Ledger.
We quote from it:

“There ought to be, there prob-
ably is some sage deduction to be
drawn from the prevalence of poets
in the varlous collegiate atmos-
pheres, and from the absence of
certain noted institutions. Miami
University has for some years
maintained, like Michigan, a resi-
dent poet on the campus to afford
inspiration and provide example,
yet Miami has not a solitary rep-
resentative. Bucknell, whose poets
published a splendid book of verse
a few months ago, has but two
representatives in the collection.
Rollins. down in Florida, has
stressed creative writing, as has
Wisconsin yet neither gives a poem
to the book. Vassar, the institu-
tion which gave poetic nourishment
to Edna St. Vineent Millay, has
evidentiy but one poet now. Mount
Holyoke, however, with two noted
poets on the faculty, presents three
contributors.”

Selection

TOPICS VARIED

Judges of the argumentation con-
test for juniors, held during the up-
perclass chapel period on Friday and
Tuesday, announced their decisions to
the Bucknellian today. Each of the
four contestants will receive an
award,

The first prize offered in the con-
test will be given to Dave Evans,
whose contest selection was outstand-
{ng among the speakers. This award,
which will be presented with all
other such prizes at the time of Con-
vocation, is the largest amount offer-
ed for a single presentation.

Since the judges could not come to
a decision concerning the winner of
the second prize, they agreed to di-
vide it between Arthur Guldin and
George Abernethy, both of whom
were excellent in the delivery of
their arguments.

A third prize was also awarded as

Third Prize Awarded

a result of the contest. It is the Gret-
zinger prize, which will be given
to. David Davis for excellence in
oratory. Those who judged the en-
tire event were Professors Leo Rock-
well, Arthur Brandon, and James
Whyte.

Topies for the four arguments pre-
sented were varied. Those of Evans
and Abernethy were concerned with
more tangible subjects, such as dis-
armament and world peace respec-
tively. Guldin and Davis, on the
other hand, devoted their time to dis-
cussions of “What Does the Future
Hold” and “Elements of Success.” |

This is the first time that the con-
test has been held in chapel before a
greater portion of the student body.
The success of the venture prompts
Professor Whyte, who is in charge of
all public speaking contests, to con-
tinue this method in the future.

of Forrest D. Brown, the majority of
the cabinet members for the coming
year were selected. The first meet-
ing of this group will be held in the
Y. M. C. A. room, Wednesiday, at 7:30

Four assistants have been selected
to aid Walter Hopper in the publi.
cation of the freshman handbook.
They are Harry Young, Vincent Hal-
bert, Edward Myers, and Robert
‘Huchins.

On the division of the cabinet on
religious education, Arthur Guldin,

during the first week of next Decem-

Representatives from approximate. |

from one of the large universities of
Canada will probably be asked to

The conference will be in imitation
of the world disarmament conference

the model meeting is being planned
in response to the powerful letter

Game 15-4

BETA KAPPAS LOSE

Tau Epsilon Delta’s baseball team
moved one notch nearer the top in
league 1 by defeating Phi Kappa yes-
terday 15-4. The game was won in
the first inning when the Teds pushed
seven runs across the plate. “Al”
Wedeen played a good game for the
winners, figuring in three double
plays and securing two hits. Sty-
boski, Phi Kappa third baseman, hit
a home run with the bases full, thus
accounting for all the losers’ runs.

At the same time Beta
team was losing ground in the race
when it lost to Phi Gamma Delta
6-3. Flexer’s good pitching for the
losers could not offset the hitting of
the Fijis. White pitched a good
game for the winners and was ably
supported by Marter’s and Andro-
ski’s hitting. The loss puts the Beta
Kappa’s in third place, one game be-
hind the Phi Gams, who moved into
seond place in League H by virtue
ot the victory. Sigma Alpha Fpsilon
at present holds first place in that

will be the soldiers of tomorrow.”

Beta Kappa Baseball Team Sinks
To Second Place Because
Of 3-0 Loss

CONTEST BEST PLAYED
OF ANY THIS SEASON

Sigma Alpha Epsilon's ‘baseball
aggregation took undisputed posses-
sion of league IT Friday by defeating
‘Beta Kappa’s team, 3-0. The contest
was the best-played game of the
year. Chenoweth pitched a three-
hit game for the winners, while
Flexer contributed a fine-pitched
game for Beta Kappa.

The only earned run was a home
yun by Hinkle, S. A. E. first sacker.
“The other two runs made by the win-
ners were unearned, due to several
errors by the infield of the losers.
Shipps, B. K. right fielder, starred
at bat for his team. The result of
the game puts S. A. E, in first place
with four victories and no defeats;
Beta Kappa sinks to second place
with three wins and one loss.

At present both teams seem to be
sure of entering the semi-final round.
‘However o “dark horse’ team may
come along and beat out the Beta
Kappa’s. TT. U. O. and Sigma Chi
are fairly certain of winning semi-
final honors in league one, but they
are being pressed closely by Tau

University Considering Purchase
Of Talking Picture Apparatus

With the quadrangle as a theater,
talking pictures were shown outdoors
| Monday ns a part of a demonstration

Philadelphia motion picture supply
The university is considering
the purchase of talking picture ap-
paratus,

The pictures were shown in the af-
ternoon in the Engineering building,
and only about 30 students were
present. Woping to draw a larger
audtence, the movie men set up their
apparatus on the quadrangle, and
there put on a program before more
than 250 students. Women students
were given the privilege of attend-
ing, but very few came.

The program was made up of a
Fox Movietone newsreel, 2 comedy,
jand “The Big Trail.” The amplify-
ing equipment had sufficient volume
to fill the quadrangle with sound,
and many students saw the perform-
ance from their dormitory rooms.

Several departments of the univer-
sity could use sound picture equip-
ment in their work, and it is for this

house.

Pan-Hellenic Council Presents
New Rushing Code at Final
Meeting of Year

BANQUET THURSDAY

Women’s rushing rules for the
ext college term were recommended
y the Pan-llellenic Council at its
inal meeting yesterday afternoon
and have been approved by Dean
Amelia E. Clark.

The major changes that have been
nade in the rushing procedure con-
st of alteration in the length of time
that may be devoted to this business,
and in the addition of a one-day open
sushing period to take place at the
close of a new 10-day rushing regu-
ation. The former rushing rules al-
owed for a period of two weeks.

At the meeting of the couneil it
was also decided that a banquet
would be held Thursday evening at
the Hopp Inn in Mifflinburg. Bernice}
Holz, ‘32, will be in charge of this
affair. The new sophomore members
of the council, who attended their
first meeting yesterday, will also be

promised those who attend. Unfor-
tunately, the band will not be able
to aid in providing the musie.

This venture with an all-student
sing has been sanctioned by the uni-
versity, which has placed Ralph
Hartz as faculty representative. To-
gether with a large group of students
representing the societies on the
campus, he has worked to push this
project, which he believes will de-
velop into a popular campus activity
if it is carried on from year to year.

Many large colleges frequently
hold such sings, which are looked
forward to by the majority of the
student body. It is hoped that the
sing on this campus will create a
greater interest in outdoor singing
to the extent that better cooperation
may be obtained at the football
fames in the fall.

PHI GAM CLIQUE WINS

Sororities Hold To Party Lines;
Three Candidates of Pi Phi
Clique Elected

Superior organization gave victory
to the fraternity clique headed by Phi
Gamma Delta in the class elections
yesterday, every candidate from that
group defeating his opponent from
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon _ political
organization by a wide margin of
votes. oa

Thomas Robert Hepler, of Wil-
lMamsport, a member of the Kappa
Sigma fraternity, was elected presi-
dent of the class of 1932. George J.
Vetter, Lambda Chi Alpha, and
Charles S. Roush Jr., Delta Sigma,
were chosen to lead the classes of
1933 and 1984, respectively.

The present sophomore class elect-
ed Harry C. Owens, Phi Kappa Psi,
editor of the 1983 L’Agenda. Philip
E. Jones, Phi Gamma Delta, was
named business manager of the year-
book.

Sororities Clique

Remarkable in this. year’s election
was the fact that the sorority cliques
held to party lines. Pi Beta Phi,
Delta Delta Delta, and Alpha Chi
Omega banded together in opposition
to Kappa Delta, Delta Zeta, Sigma
Sigma Delta, and Phi Mu. The three
candidates from the Pi Phi clique
were clected, probably on the
strength of that clique’s alliance with
the Phi Gamma Delta organization.

More votes were cast in the class

of 1934 election than were cast in|:

the two other class contests, but the

class of 1983 had the greatest per-

centage of its membership, voting.

STUDENTS MAKE
SOCIOLOGY TRIP

Club Visits Home, Bank, Mill,
And Factory on. Tour;, —
Holds Dinner

The last meeting of the Sociologi-
eal Club concluded this year’s activ-
ity in a very novel manner. Yester-
day afternoon the members of the
club, together with students of sociol-
ogy classes visited the Evangclical
Home, the Lewisburg National Bank,
the woolen mill, and the chair fac-
tory.

Following the afternoon's visits,
the club held a banquet in the Wo-
men’s College dinizg room, to which
various business men of Lewisburg
were Invited.

The tour and dinner were conduct+
ed as a fitting wind-up to the various
surveys of Lewisburg which the
members of the club have made as
a part of the activity of the year.

In the tour of the afternoon, inter-
est in both the technical and social
aspects of the institutions visited was
evidenced by the students. Facts
heretofore unknown or unthought of
were impressed upon the visitors.

Features of the banquet in the eve-
ning were the reports from the com-
mittee’s which have made studies in
Lewisburg, and short talks by Dr.
Winters, superintendent of the Evan
gelical Home, and by Dayton L.
Ranck, comptroller of the University.

Committee reports vere given by
Mildred Walton, °32, Elizabeth Wil-
son, '31, Myra Grigg, and Glen Rol-
lins, '32. These reports proved of
great interest to the representatives
of the town present. Dr. Winters
gave a brief description of the Home
and its operation and pointed out
that this Home and others like it are
necessary because of existing social
problems.

spective fields, and each section is
dedicnted to one of thit number.
Engravings made from charcoal of,

three firsts and three seconds to lead
in scoring with a total of 24 points.
Coates, to be consistent with all of

Strength in the weight events
caused the preponderently large total
in favor of the Battlefielders. In
the 220, broad jump,and javelin they
scored clean sweeps, while Bucknell’s
only grand slam came in the two-
mile run. In this event Randall came
through with a first while Hanisky,

CAST IN THREE PLAYS

Premieres, ‘Women Come Back”

“Park 4002” Will Feature |
Work of Groups |

WILL GIVE “JEEVES”

From comedy, through the super-|
natural to the realistic, will be the
course followed in the presentation|
of “Women Come Back,” “Jeeves,”
and “Park 4002” by actors who ure
known for their work in campus
dramatics, Thursday evening at the
high school auditorium. {

The effect of mystery and the su-
pernatural created by “Women Come
Back” will be new to campus audi-
ences. Philip Nefsser, '32, will offer
a sophisticated characterization’ of
his Satanic majesty, while Edna
Cleckner, '33, who was the heroine
of “The Cat und the Canary,” will
act the role of his equally worldly
mistress. Philip Bosearell, '33, Gret-
chen Fisher, '33, Walter ‘Hopper, '32,
and Margaret Beck, ’32, will complete
the cast.

“Jeeves” Well Done

Typically English and continually
amusing, “Jeeves” is presented by a
smooth-working cast drawn from
those whose work has been outstand-
ing in dramatics. John James, '32,
co-author of “Park 4002,’" has the
vole of the imperturable butler, about
whose character the action centers.

John Anderson, '31, who was di-
rector and who also played a part in|
the comedy at Penn State, has been!
foreed to withdraw on account of |
illness, and Philip Boscarell, '33, will
tuke his place. Mary Smith, '82,
and Franklin Bower, '33, who will
also be remembered for their parts inj
the “Cat and the Canary,” Louise
Zeigier, '32, and James Lees, 34,
wake up the rest of the dramatis
personae.

“Park 4002,” an ultra-modern real-|
istic drama showing the conflict be-|
tween divorced husband and wife, the
love of a mother for her son, and the
son’s love for a girl, has been very
carefully cast. The leading role}
will be taken by’ Margucrite Forbell,
a graduate student who is new to
dramatics here, but who has had
much experience in the amateur act-|

Because of House-Parties, |
Rajn, States Titus

Rain played havoc this week with
Interfraternity baseball games, anil!
as a result the schedule will have to
be changed to aceomodate all teams|
whose games have heen postponed.
In all probability, the semi-final con-
tests slated for next week will have
to be delayed until the winners in
each league are decided.

Charles Titus, president of the
league, has announced a new policy
in choosing teams that are to meet!
The first team in each|
league will meet the second team in
the opposite league. The winners of
these games wil meet in the finals.
The arrangement is similar to the
one that has existed in interfratern-
ity basketball. |

Sigma Alpha Epsion seems to have
first place assured in league one.
Alpha Phi Delta and Phi Gamma
Delta seem to have the imside track
in the race for second place. In
league 1, Sigma Chi heads the pro-
cession with no defeats. Tau Epsi-
lon and Delta Kappa Phi, each with
one defeat, are battling it out for
second ‘place.

Traditional Ceremonies Will Mark
Doffing ot Dinks, Black Ties, Sox

With the traditional Gauntlet Run
as a feature of the moving-up cele-
bration tonight at 8 o'clock on Loomis
Field, approximately 300 freshmen
will be served the demi-tasse of their
first year in college, with the mem-
bers of the senior and junior classes
as the swingers of paddles,

The sophomores will pull the tra-
ditional disappearing act, leaving
town to find secret hide-outs, since
it is the custom that, after the fresh-
men have run the gauntlet and have
become sophomores, they seek any
member of the class of '33 and mete
out punishment accordingly, usually
in the form of a convict-haircut.

Edward J. Smalstig, '31, president
of Senior Council, announced today
that all freshmen will assemble at
Tustin gymnasium tonight at 8
o'clock, bringing with them regula-
tion-sized paddies. Freshmen must
wear their dinks and black neckties.
A large crowd is expected to witness
the traditional celebration, as the

members of the class of ’34 become!
sophomores.

This morning and afternoon found

an increasing exodus of sophomore
men, and as the Bueknellian goes to
press, very few members of the class
of '38, remain in Lewisburg. How-
ever, several decorative haircuts arc
expeeted to grace the campus tomor-
row morning.
» It is expected that the juntors and
seniors will, as in the past, form a4
double line across Loomis Field,
through which the freshmen will run.
After this ordeal, the freshmen will
discard their dinks and other fresh-
men accessories, and set out In search
of the secretive sophomores.

It is hoped that the damage and
destruction of former moving-up
nights will not be repeated this year,
since the freshmen will be propor-
tionally assessed for the amount of
damage done, and will not receive
their final grades until these bills are
paid.

AMONG THE BOOK STALLS |

Nancy L. Griffith, '31, has created
quite an enthusiastic stir in poeti-
cal circles on the campus this week
with her Philosophic Primer for
Morons. The author had previous-
ly written a number of short
stories, a one-act play and several
poems, but refused to submit any
of them for publication. The edi-
tor of the Bucknellian finally per-
suaded her to collect her latest ef-
forts and the first editions of the
collection were given as favors at
the Sigma’: Tau Delta banquet
Monday night.

The resultant anthology has «
poem for each alphabetical letter,
and the thesis of them all is found
in Nancy’s preface: “Let us con-,
cede that morons do have their
philosophy and philosophy its
morons.”

There is a

devil-may-care air
that seems to sccompany each
poem, yet some are whimsical,
some are romantic, others are more
material, but nearly all have a
clever twist that raises them far
above “just student poetry.” We
reprint some of the shorter selec-
tions:

Exit the “Orpheum” — enter the
“Roxy.” Lewisburg now has a new
theater, one that is modern in every
respect. Opening night was held
Monday, with capacity houses for
both shows.

The Roxy is one of a chain of
theaters throughout this section that
is known for its excellence in per-
formance and program. The local
theatre has a seating capacity of 400
| and is —s to run three shows
on week days and five on Saturday.

Sound engineers were here from
the Western Electric plant and pro-
nounced the acoustics of the “Roxy”
nearly perfect. It is the opinion of
many that this theater has the best

shows inthis part of the state.

Dr. Hunt expressed the wish that
the university might hold more all-
student sings in which the entire
| student body would participate.
Bucknell is endeavoring to foster a
musical spirit such as is prevalent
at most of the better-known colleges,
and the administration is willing to
lback the musical organizations in
jearrying out this endeavor.

} Plays Trombone Solo

The other solo number on the pro-
| gram was given by James Phillips,
\’34, on the trombone. He played
|“Somewhere a Voice Is Calling,” and
yaunaertd. a hearty round of applause.
— Shupe, °34, accompanied

him.

Singing by the large student group
| was led alternately by Ralph Hartz.
director of the men’s glee club, and
by Osborn, who conducted his or-
chestra at the same time. The song
program started off with “America
| the Beautiful” and continued through
la variety of 15 numbers. Such ‘se-
|lections as “My Wild Irish Rose,”
“Sweetheart of My Student Days,”

“Sweet Jennie ‘Leé," “Would You
Like To Take a Walk,” and ‘The
World is Waiting For the Sunrise”
were sung with gusto.

Mr. Hartz, who introduced the
idea of the sing to this campus, and
who aided Phi Mu Alpha, men's musi-
eal fraternity, in carrying the pro-
ject through, was greatly pleased by
the turnout at the songfest.

“DOCKIE” LAWSON
Philosopher and Friend

What shall it profit a student to have a pleasing voice, to
be a good mixer, to have repute as a school politician, to make
a fraternity and attain social distinction, to win his B and all
that, unless he has some good specifications and plans about
life. The only motivation that can coordinate and synchron-
ize his gifts and callings is a philosophy of the Golden Rule.
Following one life trail, he will leave the world a little better
place to live in; but if selfishness, raised to the Nth power, is
the other destination, he will hock his soul beyond the price
of redemption.

Dr. George B. Lawson, professor of philosophy, has in-
spired the motivating force of many students. His moral
blueprints are directing youthful minds into the pleasing ar-
chitecture of harmonious neighbors. Probably more than
any other professor, he is continually interviewed on the vital
problems of life. Students have found in him a sincere con-
cern for their welfare. His recent illness and enforced vaca-
tion has been a severe loss to this institution.

Dr. Lawson enjoyed the rich heritage of a cultured
Christian home. His distinguished and scholarly father many
of us knew. Almost ninety years old, he had retained much
of his old-time fire and zeal, and reflected as in a mirror the
kindly look of one who throughout life had gone about doing
good. Dr. Lawson reflects in himself the best features of an
older school of philosophers; and yet he possesses a keen and
searching mind that has thade him one of the moderns. He
is a product of metaphysics, philosophy, mathematics, history,
the classical languages, and English literature. Modern
study along psychological lines, pedogogical methods and the
newer sciences have kept him in the vanguard of latter day
teachers.

We have built up a tradition around the older college
professors. They had become a distinct type in our art, liter-
ature, gossip, and caricature. Their figure was unique in our
imagination if not in fact. They connoted profound thought
and absent-mindedness. Let us be charitable to our local
owners of plug hats. Their thinking—of themselves—had
made everything else oblivious. Big and little Dicks just na-
turally get that way—somewhat stiff and stuck-up. The old
professor has been regarded as slow and impractical, more
particular about his accent than his dress, more concerned
with clear thinking than with homelly duties of everyday life,
more in love with his many manuscripts than the needs of his
up-to-date family. If Dr. Lawson has ever attempted to be a
dreamer his good wife and family have kept his feet on the
ground. While he may por\ray some of the characteristics
of an older generation, he has retained only the best.

This good professor is likeable in and out of the class
room. His ability in the use of the English language has
marked him as an outstanding patron of the art that encour-
ages and speeds up American slang into good usage. With
plenty of strength in his adjectives and an occasional mild ex-
pletive, his conversation does not lack spice and pep. He has
shown justice and sympathy toward his students at all times.
and likewise an appreciation of the student viewpoint. Un-
derstanding human nature in general, he is a congenial com-
panion with a cheerful disposition. He is open-minded and
mellow in his charitable judgment and shows a wide view-
point. He reflects a tolerance toward non-academic pursuits
and all religious and political beliefs. Just human enough to
keep from a sour and repulsive piousness, with a keen and
ready sense of humor, he has shown himself capable of con-
tinuous intellectual gowth.

One of the beliefs prevalent in the day of “og” was that
the selection of a professor was more important than the sub-
ject matter. When Dr. Harris became annoyed one day at
some frivolity and authoritative traffic signal—first at the of-
fender and then at the main exit. Thereby the writer really
slipped one over on the good Doctor. By his own potent
suggestion, we had the privilege of taking the term’s work
over again, under Bucknell’s best qualified teacher of all time.
If we were trying to get through college again, Dr. Lawson
would head the list of all our electives. He has come nearer
than anyone else we know in taking the place of Dr. Harris in
the teaching segment of his many-sided career.

And further, we would place him with Clarence Johnson
on the pedestal of new Bucknell professors as one of the two
choicest spirits disccfered by Dr. Hunt's administration, His
independence in thought and speech, his humanity, his un-
erring judgment—speaking with authority on the deeper
meaning and worth while pursuits of life—all these proclaim
him a good disciple of Christian Philosophy.

SUSQUEHANNA T0 BE
HOST TO TRACKMEN
OF CENTRAL PENNA.

Central Pennsylvania — Inter-
collegiates Scheduled | For
Selinsgrove on Saturday

STRONG CONTENDERS IN
BUCKNELL’S DIVISION

The Central Pennsylvania Track
and Field Championships will be held
at Selinsgrove, Saturday, under the
auspices of Susquehanna University.
A strong field is expected to enter
the class A competition, the division
jn which Bucknell is entered.

Coates is the most logical man to
win the half mile event, and his
chances in the mile, in which he fin-
ished second last year, are very good.
Yn the half mile it is very probable
that a new record will be hung up,
ns Coates has been traveling at a
fast clip all season, On the one oc-
casion that he was pushed hard he
ran the distance in two minutes an
one-half second.

Mile Run Fast

In the mile run there will be
plenty of competition, as the field is
fast, and the man who beat Coates to
the tape last year is still in the com-
petition.

The Bucknell team as a whole will
not have a very good chance to take
the team honors. Dickinson, a mem-
ber of the association, has already
proven too strong for the Bisons.

Sullivan, who took second in the
pole vault last year, will be trying to
better his performance of the past
season. Bailey of Diekinson, who
won the pole vault last year is not
competing this year, but Kennedy,
also of Dickinson, has been showing
good form so far this season.

Weights Need Distance

In the weights, things are not very
promising for a Bucknell victory.
Harod Geigur has been winning his
events in the dual meets but will
have to get more distance to cop at
the championships.

In meeting both Dickinson and
Gettysburg, Bucknell has encounter-
ed the two strongest contenders for
the team championship. Fach of
these two teams his a man who gets
most of their points. Dickinson has
Kennedy, and Gettysburg has
Schwartz. He has also opposed!

WYOMING SEM HITS
HEYDRICH TOWIN, 18-2

(Frosh Nine Has Little Chance
Against More Experienced
Veterans, Friday

FROSH LACK PUNCH

Wyoming Seminary came here Fri-
day, and after hitting pitcher Hey-
drich hard in the early innings, went
back to Kingston with a 18-1 victory.
The baby Bisons missed numerous
chances to score, while Wyoming
made the most of its opportunities.

Lavin hurled’ a careful game for
the victors, allowing only eight hits.
Wyoming ran up fifteen hits during
the afternoon. Davis, Wyoming out-
fielder, starred at bat, making four
hits; Cole, Young, and Harris each
made two hits for the freshmen, In
the second and third innings, Coach
Musser’s men had the bases filled,
but the Jast punch was missing, and
the freshmen remained scoreless
until the final inning.

Sem Experienced

The winners were far too experi-
enced and polished for Bucknell's
cub team. Whereas this was the
second contest of the year for the
freshmen, Wyoming was engaging in
its cleventh game. Conch Musser
was not disheartened by the defeat
and has high hopes for his team in
the remaining two games on the
freshmen schedule.

There is still an open date for the
frosh on Saturday. An attempt is
being made to secure a game on that
date to be played in the morning so
that the varsity may engage with
Albright in the afternoon. The year-
lings will wind up their schedule on
May 28, when Penn State's fresh-
men will be met at Lewisburg.

Led by “Dash” Kennedy, who gar-

Dickinson College track team nosed
out the Bucknell trackmen in a dual
track meet at the Memorial Stadium
last Saturday, 68 to 58. Kennedy
took five first places, in the 100 and
220-yard dashes, the broad and hig
jumps, and the pole vault.

The Bisons could only gather to-

gether six first places out of fourteen
events, and their failure in this re-
| spect probably spelled their doom.
They also fell down in the two-mile
run, which Dickinson swept without
any opposition whatsoever.

Captain “Henny” Coates did a good
job in the 880 and the mile, and his
two first places equalled the two

Bucknell's varsity baseball team
has had some rough sledding for the
past week, and harder times are still
ahead. For within the next week
the Bisons meet Gettysburg, Al-
bright, and Dickinson, the latter two
teams being encountered on Loomis
field.

Gettysburg has defeated the Bisons,
once this year in Lewisburg, and un-
less Bucknell plays inspired ball, the
Bullets will:make it two straight
this afternoon.

Dickinson Mediocre

Albright has a veteran outfit, and
bids fair to give Bucknell a hard
game. Dickinson has a medioere ag-
gregation which should not trouble
Snavely’s men. Both home games will
start at 4 o'clock on Loomis Field, the
former being played Saturday, and
Dickinson being met Wednesday.

In an attempt to smooth the rough;
spots of his team, Coach Snavely has!
tried various combinations in the in-|
field and outfield. The starting line-

ups of all three contests will prob-| |

ably be Young, Dutchak, Ammerman,
outfielders; Mills, Williams, Ross, |
Vetter, infielders; Trudnak and Shaw
or Neid as the battery. |

Batting. is Heavier |

Perhaps victories will come easier
for Bucknell now that it has found |
{ts batting strength. The Bisons still
have several games before the season
closes, and a few winning games will
prevent the year from being a com-
plete failure. The team is fielding
and hitting well, mainly because of
many changes by Coach Snavely.
Nied is doing a fine job behind the
plate in place of Shaw, and Young
and Boyer are showing up well in
the outfield,

TALKS TO OUR
MERCHANTS

On one of his soliciting tours, one of our fellows stopped
awhile to chat with a leading merchant in a neighboring
town. This man is the head of a womens’ department store,

and a modern one at that.

“You know,” he said, “here is a good advertising slogan.
When business is good—advertise; when business is rotten—

advertise to the limit.”

Needless to say, he gets his business. Any merchant can
make a success of his enterprise when people are willing to
spend—in fact, begging for the privilege of buying. Tt takes
a shrewd man, however, to draw his customers when they are
loath to spend. He must use the most clever means of pre-

senting his wares that are at his command.

Again, it is needless to say that he advertises. There are
no means in this day that can be used with such power, and

with such results.

The man who doesn’t advertise cannot get in touch with
those that don’t visit his store. He cannot depend on word-
of-mouth advertising, for it isn’t certain, nor will it cover a
wide area. He cannot do without advertising, for then he
will be left far behind the others. Sooner or later, he will ad-

vertise. Why not now?

THE BUCKNELLIAN is always

with its advertisers in any way that it can.

ready to cooperate
Whether it is
preparing copy, giving advice, or any service whatever, it is a

pleasure to us.

by short impromptu speeches by each
of the 18 persons who attended.

First Places in Field Events
For Decisive Victory

The Bucknell frosh made a clean
sweep of the field events to give them
n decisive win over the Dickinson
frosh in a meet run in conjunction
with the varsity events Saturday.

James, Myers, Jett, and Elias con-
tributed first places in the field
events, winning the shot, broad jump,
pole vault, and javelin in the order
named. James also took first in the
discus throw, while Moll won the
half mile, Deacon the mile, and Saf-

In the half mile, shotput, and dis-

The addition of some of these men

Students Should See Dr. F. G. Davis
About Provisional Certificates

Students who expect to obtain
their college provisional certificates
for teaching are advised to see Pro-
fessor Frank G. Davis at his office in
Old Main. Since application for the
certificates must be sent to Harris-
hurg some time in advance of Com-
mencement, Dr. Davis is particularly
anxious that students attend to the
matter at once.

Abandon Policy of Silence
To Prevent Question ~
Of School Honor

“NO STOOL PIGEONS”

President Emory W. Hunt, Dean
R. H. Rivenburg, and Dean Amelia
E. Clark concur in a statement is-
sued to The Bucknellian this morning
in which it is denied that there are
“stool pigeons” at Bucknell.

The statement follows:

While for years it has been the |
policy of the Administration at
Bucknell not to answer criticism |
which may appear in The Buck-
nellian, becnuse it has been rep-
resented to us by students that
adherence to this policy now is
likely to be misconstrued by
many students who may feel that
our remaining silent on this oc-
easion is an admission that the
statements made in the letter to
the editor and in The Bueknell-
ian editorial of April 30, 1931 on
“Stool Pigeons” have some foun-
dation, we are persuaded that it
may be desirable to make a brief
statement.

The President and Deans of
Bucknell University are not in
the business of bribing and cor-
rupting students. We have no
detectives and no “stool pig-
eons,” and will welcome the op-
portunity to talk, without preju-
dice, with any student or stu-
dents, or nny other person who
may have had such an impres-
sion.

Academy of Sciences to Publish

Article by Professor MacCreadie

An article “On the Stability of the
Motion of a Viscous Fluid,” written
recently by William T. MacCreaidie,
of the department of mathematics,
has been accepted for publication in
the June issue of the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences,
at Washington, D. C.

The Proceedings of the Academy
are printed monthly; the issue con
taining the article will appear on
June 1b. Professor MacCreadie
learned of the acceptance of his ar-
ticle this week, when he received a
communication from Dr. F. K. Richt

myer, a member of the National Re-
search Council, which had been for-
warded to him through the Harvard
office.

It is considered quite an honor tu
have an article published in the Pro-
ceedings. All articles must first be
submitted to a member of the Na-
ttonal Research Couneil, who, if he
approves them, will pass them on for
publication.

It was found impossible to type
the article on a mathematical type-
writer, because of the complexity of
the equations. Therefore it had to
be written out by hand.

i

ZANELLAVICEPRESIDENT |

At the last meeting of the Forum;
for this year, held Monday night,
Robert Grove, ’81, read a paper on}
“The Political, Social, and Economic
Aspects of Russia.” In a_ business
session John Mohr, '33, was elected |
president of the club for next year,
and Dominic Zanella was elected vice
president. The office of seeretary-
treasurer was declared open until
next year. S

In his paper Mr. Grove presented
ina very scholarly manner the major
interests of the Soviet regime. The}
Russian plan was outlined as one of |
Communism versus Capitalism, and!
Atheism versus Religion. The plan
is a system of absolutism with com-
plete subservience of individual de-
sire. All the energy and material of
the nation is being used to make the
five-year plan succeed.

Social Reform Effective

The socinl reform that is going
with the political and economical
change is not resulting in the de-
bauchery of the people. It is the
opinion that nowhere in the world
an people be found that are so free
from an artificial sex code as in Rus-
ia.
The library has been presented by
the club with material that has been
sent to it by the Carnegie Endow
nent for International Peace. Thi:
material, consisting of 12 books and

number of pamphlets and docu
ments, was used by members of the;
Forum throughout the semester for
eference reading.

been foolish enough to remain in

where sophomores were found, plenty
of exeitement ensued. One sopho-

sophomores made good their get-
away.
No Hair Cuts

Though no hair-cuts were seen on
the campus the following day, there
are several sophomores who will re-
member the past move-up celebra-
tion. The new Roxy theatre was)
stormed by the newly created sophs,
but they failed to gain admittance.
Evidently the men of '34 were too
busy searching for sophomores, for
no damages of considerable conse-|
quences were reported on the hill.

book to be issued in September. Both
men and women of the new class
will receive books with the same con-

Articles on fraternities and organi-

features of the new handbook. The
numerous constitutions and by-laws
of the women’s organizations, form-
erly a part of the women’s handbook,
and the small diary have been left
out as a result of the compression of
material.

TAKING THE REINS

In taking over the duties of man-
aging The Bucknellian, the new staf
realizes the responsibility that rests
upon it; it is almost needless to say
that it will attempt to meet this re-
sponsibility as well as have former
staffs. To do this, the new staff must
fill the columns with all the news
about Bucknell, accurately told, and
must see that the editorial columns
veflect the best stadent opinion, the
judgment of what is hest to rest with
the staff.

Fasy to say, but very difficult to
Thus the staff will welcome
criticism and suggestion from all
who read the paper. Only in that
way ean the goal be approached.

It might be said here that The
Bucknellian js perhaps the only uni-

dom does the entire student body

When the Freshman drops his dink

For without these signs of innocence
All the Freshmen now have disap- |

And the only way to tell them thence|
Is to note the Freshman’s heavier

SENIOR PASTIMES

Between now and June 9 ninety |
percent of all Senior men will: |

Spend three hours a week talking
very, very seriously with their pro-
fessors about the serious things in
life.

Attempt to convince John Plant
that they have spent half their col-
Jege days in the gymnasium.

Raise an awful protest about the |
exorbitant price of caps and gowns,
but in the end take it and like it.

Devise three excellent plans for
eluding their fraternity caterers in
all attempts to collect the May board
bill.

Write innumerable times: “T am
now completing a four year course at
Bucknell and am sure I could satis-
factorily fill the position you have
open. For further recommendation
T refer you to "

Attempt to sell their souls to Dean
Rivenburg for three quality credits.

Plan to visit, with diplomas safely

professors and tell them just what

Darling Wilbur:

1 REAlly want to thank you again
for the GLORious time |} had at your
house party. Of course, you WERE
a TEEny bit intoxicated, but Mamma
had warned me about you college
boys so } didn’t worry AT AQ.

But 1 REAlly feel BADIy, Wilbur
dear, beenause when you put me on
the train to go home, you PROMised |
to write me EVEry day, and here |
FOUR WHOLE days have passe’ |
and I haven’t gotten ONE letter.

The only POSsible explanation 1)
| can think of, and Mamma does too, is]
that you had just a LITtle too — =)
\to drink and don't remember EVERY-
‘thing that happened that last even- |
ing. When 1 told Mamma that you!
gave the porter for a tip that ten-|
dollar gold piece that your dad had
sent you for your birthday, she said
she thought it was an even chance
that you REAlly didn’t know what
you were doing. |

If that is so you probably don’t re-}
member much about what was AB-
SOLUTEly the most WONderful eve-|
ning of my life. When you took me
to call on the Dean during intermis: |
sion 1 was SO THRILUed to think
that MY Wilbur really knew all thoze
important people. T was really TER-
| RIBly disappointed that he had gone |
| away for the week-end.

{ And Wilbur darling, T will CER-

“tuinly feel at home whenever T come
to your fraternity house again be-|
cause I think 1 contributed to the
suceess of your party. Just when
you seemed sort of mixed about
things T saw a bottle fall from your

| pocket. i- } am not |

]

Now Wilbur, I
POSITIVEly dumb anil when T real-|
ized that the chaperones had seen it
fall T told you that something had to
he done, but you ebuldn’t hear me.
Then, all of a sudden, T had one of
those inspirations which come to
people when things are a matter of
life -or death. I pieked up that
bottle, took it over to the chaperones
and said, “Smell it, it’s gingerale.”’ |

they couldn't possibly think it wrong
| of you to drink gingerale.

Of COURse you won't think this |
was much but I DO feel that 1 did my
little bit to help things along. Mam-
ma is calling me now, Wilbur, but re-
| member, a letter a day.

Yours with lots of love,
Maybelle.

BISON TRACKMEN
COMPLETE SEASON
AGAINST TEMPLE

Coates Should Repeat Mile,
Half-Mile Victories: Owls
Excel in Dashes

TEAM TO MAKE EFFORT
TO WIN FINAL MEET

The Bison track team closes its
season with Temple University inthe
Owl's stadium at Philadelphia next
Saturday.

The Temple team is very strong
and will present extremely tough
ompetition in the dashes, where they
have three good men. As Bucknell
will be strong in the distance events,
t will probably be up to the weight
events to decide the meet.

If Captain Coates wins his two
events, the mile and half mile, he
will have completed an undefeated)
season. Thus far he has overcom
al] opposition to break the tape in
every race which he starte: |

Outstanding Point Getter

Peacock, who runs the  hundred,|
220, and broad jumps, is one of the
outstanding point getters on the Owl]
team. Tinkler, who high jumps, pole]
vaults, and throws the javelin, pre-
sents another threat to Bucknell’s
winning the meet. Goldstein, whom
Coates defeated Jast year, will fur-)
nish the opposition in the half mile

As the team has not yet won aj
meet this year, an extra effort will
be made to defeat Temple and chalk
up one meet on the right side of the
score sheet

It is unfortunate that the Temple|
eet is scheduled for the same day
s the Middle Atlantic Chatpion-|
ships, as Coates, MacKenzie and Sul-
van would all have a chance t
ace in that meet.

JUNIATA, STATE

‘Nick’ Kenny To Defend Mound
Against Huntingdon Team
In Tomorrow's Game.

TRUDNAK FOR STATE

Coach Snavely’s tossers will en-
deavor to improve their winning
column tomorrow and Saturday when
they meet Juniata and Penn State in
their last trip of the current season.
The team has not been very success-
ful this year, and two victories this
week-end will help materially in
keeping the campaign from being a
total wash-out.

Juniata has also had a rather poor
season, and the Bisons should win at
Huntingdon. “Nick” Kenny will
probably take the mound for Buck-
nell, sinee Trudnak will in all prob-
ability be kept fresh for the Nittany
Lions. The Penn State outfit has
had an indifferent year, and prospects
for a vietory at State College are
good,

Bucknell’s team seems to have’ im-
proved in the last three games. Hold-
ing Albright to a close score, as the
Bisons did Saturday, is no little feat,
since the Reading nggregation is
reputed to have one of the best enst-
ern inter-collegiate teams. The
game did show that Bucknell's bat-
ting punch is stil] missing, and if the
teams expects to take the games this
week-end, it will have to improve its
stick work,

“Steve” Trudnak Again Victim
Of Errors; Loses Close
Contest in Pitching

| LARGE CROWD ATTENDS

“Steve” Trudnak was once again x
victim of errors, and lost a_ tight
pitching duel Saturday to Wenrich of
| Albright, 3-1. A Jarge house-party
crowd witnessed the contest, which
was the best played game of -the
year on Loomis field.

Both hurlers pitehed careful
games, each allowing but seven hits.
Five errors by the Bisons, two by
Trudnak himself, were a large factor
in Albright scoring. A rally by the
Snavelymen in the last inning was
{not enough to pull the game from
the fire, falling short by two tallies.

Score Two Runs

The winners started carly, scoring
two runs in the opening — session.
These runs proved cnough to win:
Bucknell’s punch seemed to he miss-
ing in the third and fifth innings,
when several hits placed men in scor-
ing position, only to have the men re-
| main on the paths because of the in-
effectiveness of Bison batters. Or-
llisli and Fromm, of Albright, and
Kenny for Bucknell, were the slug-
gers of the game, each securing two
lhits. The last was the fifth of the
jeurrent campaign for Bucknell, as
jcompared with two victories.

SCORES 9-0; 8-1,

The Bucknell golf team decisively
defeated St. Thomas on the local
links Friday afternoon, winning

| every match to score a 9 to 0 victory.
A stiff breeze handieapped the con-
testants and kept the scores high.

Grauer and Ziegler provided a
good Jead for the local golfers by
defeating Hoffman and O’Brien re-|
spectively 5 up and 4 to play. Their
foursome ended on the twelfth “hole
with the Bisons winning 7 and 6.

Robertson and Weber turned in
three more points when Robertson
defeated Dattner 9 and 7. Weber
then moved up to number four man
and defeated Wait by 4 and 2. Buck-

| nel won the foursome 8 and 7.
Cox Shows Up Well

Cox, a neweomer to the Bucknell
squad, in combination with Vogt, also
made a fine showing. Three points
were added when Vogt trounced De-
Vizzia 7 and 6, while Cox easily
turned back Reilly 9 and 8. This
match went to Bucknell 8 and 7. St.
Thomas was completely outclassed
from the start.

Saturday afternoon, the Hison
golfers chalked up the second victory
of the week by defeating Bloomsburg
8 to 1. /This was a return game,

\try Club links ten days ago. Robert-

No Medal Scores

No good medal scores were turned
in because of an exceptionally strong
wind which played havoc with drives.
Grauer and Ziegler turned in three
points in the first match, Grauer de-
feating Stokes 2 and 1, while Ziegler
defeated Loller 8 and 2. Buekne!l
won the foursome by 2 and 1.

Robertson and Halicki turned in
two points, winning their foursome
83 and 2. Robertson had his man five
down at the end of the first nine, but
fell victim to the wind on the incom-
ing nine, losing to Fischer by 1 up.
Halicki easily defeated Kistler 3 and
2.

Weber and Vogt added the final |
three points by defeating Keller and
Hoffman, each defeating his man by |
5 and 4. The foursome ended 5|

Hucknell's golf team is getting off
to a nice start this year. It is not
often that a team has such a success-

have been victims of many a squir-

rel’s sweet tooth.

Tt is now a well-kngwn fact among
the coeds that squirrels relish other
food than nuts. A neatly packed
box of sweets was standing on the
desk of a certain freshman occupy-
ing a fourth floor room in the new
dormitory. The owner had intended
to send these chocolates home—a
distance of more than 200 miles. Mr
Gray Squirrel made’ it his policy
“never to put off until tomorrow
what can be done today.”

Climbing through the window
which was open three inches from
the bottom, and seeing no one around
the supposed eater of nuts jumped at
the sweets and helped himself to the
box. i

Lewisburg squirrels are also ex-
tremely fond of the corridors in the
women’s dorms. It is not an unusual
sight to see them racing up and down
the hall and frightening the inhabi-
tants of the dormitories.

fA list of all the automobiles passing up Market Street, or the foreign
freight cars going through town would parallel it in importance. We
could forgive you, however, for this if it were counter balanced with some
good editorials. Has Lewisburg reached the millenium? Are there no
unregenerate voters who need prodding a little, are the streets perfect,
the morals above reproach? Doesn't a good editor hunger and thirst
after righteousness, or are his chief aims afew ads anda colorless sheet?
Doesn't he like a good scrap now and then or should he be afraid of
everybody? A serond-hand crack at Judge Johnson js rather small edi-
torial stuff. Probably the judge would readily admit that like most
people, he would favor his own family a litle and that the exigency of
practical polities demand the payments of politieal debts. Let's have a
little uriginality, Charlie, for a paper without editorials is like a mule
without a kick or a car with nothing under the hood. You have made %
an excellent chauffer for a glider so far, Charlie, but please start some-
thing different. We all enjoy a little variety.

At the Homestead Tea Room in

music teachers and supervisors of
this vicinity met for the purpose of
organizing an association of music
teachers. Professor Ralph F. Hartz
and Anna M. Pines, both of the
School of Music, represented Buck-

Professor Hartz was appointed on
the executive committee of the or-

"FEEL the difference

HEAR the difference

TasTE THE DIFFERENCE!

Like an oasis in the dusty desert of dried
tobacco, the new Camel Humidor Pack
brings you the delight of fine quality
cigarettes in factory-fresh, mild con-

dition.

Now, wherever you go, you can always
be sure of getting a fresh, throat-easy
cigarette when you demand Camels.

It’s easy to tell the difference. Your
sense of touch detects it as you roll a
cigarette between your fingers. Dry to-
bacco is stiff and crumbly. Camels are

full bodied and pliant.

Even your ear can tell the difference.
For a dried-out cigarette crackles when

| you roll it.

But the real test is taste and taste is
causing a great nation-wide switch of

men and women alike to Camels in the
scientific new Humidor Pack. As you
draw in that fragrant, mild, cool smoke,
redolent with the joy of choicest Turk-
ish and mellow Domestic tobacco, only
then do you realize the full importance
of this new Humidor Pack.

For scorched or dried tobacco is brash
and tasteless and its smoke is unkindly
hot to the tongue and throat.

If you are already a Camel smoker
you have noticed the improvement in
thie your favorite cigarette.

If you don’t smoke Camels, try them
for just one day to see how much you're
missing. After you’ve known the mild-
ness and delight of a really fresh ciga-
rette, switch back if you can.

Hitting the offerings of Kenny,

inning, Juniata managed to secure
enough runs in that session to defeat,
Bucknell Friday 5 to 3 at Hunting-
don. Rain ended the game in the
seventh Inning.

Both teams secured seven hits, but
superior twirling by Fraker of Juni-
ata in the pinches kept the Bucknell|
seore low. Kenny lost his own game
when he walked three men in the
second, which Juniata combined with
three hits to seore four tallies. La-
porte’s triple for Juniata was the
feature of the rally. Mills and Neid
each hit two singles to aecount for
more than half the Bison's hits.

The loss to the Huntingdon outfit
was the sixth of the season for the)
Snavelymen as compared with only,
three victories. The team seemed
greatly improved over its early sea-
son form. Only one error was made,
and the sluggers appeared’ to have
hit their stride. Coach Snavely did
not use Trudnak at all against Juni-|

AK MARS
SEASON FOR TRACKMEN

Much Material Discovered; Prospects
For Next Year's Cinder Team
Very Promising

The Bucknell track team this sea-
son, while it did not win a meet, un-
covered some very good performers
and gave promise of better things to
come in track prospects at Bucknell}
in the future. '

Captain Coates, one of the best:
mid-distance runners in the Middle
Atlantic states, gained the titles of)
champion in both the mile and half-
mile in the Central Pennsylvania
Championship meet, and would have
given a very good account of himself
in the Middle Atlantic Championship
meet had Bucknell not been scheduled
to meet Temple on that date. His
times for the two events are as good
as those which won in the Middle
Atlanties.

Roland MacKenzie, who in the high
jump, broad jump, and high hurdles, |
was a consistent point winner
throughout the season, took the
championship at the Central Penna.
meet in the high jump. His best
performances of the season were in
taking second to Brill of ‘Temple, and
Witherow of Lafayette. On both of
these oceasions “Mac” cleared 5 ft.
10 ins.

Egel, Fry Add Points |

“Norm” Egel and Harry Fry, while
not regular performers, came through
in the meets in which they took part,
and both earned enough points to aid
materially in the Bison totals.

Wells and Sullivan assured Buck-
tell of the majority of the points in
the pole vault in almost every meet,
Wells tying for first at Lafayette,
and winning at Temple; while Sal. |
livan reached his best form to take|
second in the Central Penna. Cham-|
plonship meet. Sullivan also ran the
low hurdles, placing in every meet in|
this event. i

George Abernethy, after getting =
slow start at the beginning of the
season, picked up some points toward
the end of the campaign. “Art”
Randall placed well in the two-mile
grind, winning at Susquehanna and
against Gettysburg at the stadium.

Geiger threw the javelin and bela)
cus to score some points in every
meet, While “Chuck” Titus, Brestin,
Miller, Smith, Hanisky, Lintz, Cook
