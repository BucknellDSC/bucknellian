TUSTIN, '84, ADDRESSES

Ernest L. Tustin , 84, addressed
the American Bar Assoclation at its
anual meeting in St. Louls, in August
speaking very earnestly on the need

LAWYERS |

|

for the establishment in all cities of ,

municipal legal ald bureaus such as
he has recently established in Phila-
delphia of which we elsewhere glve
an account.

He sald in part, as reported by the
Philadelphia Public Ledger, “The
duty of the municipality to conduet a
legal ald bureau is just as much u
civic duty as cleaning streets and
pproviding water. A bureau to Inves-
tigate and defend impositions upon
the poor and ignorant, and to furnish
a proper and ratlenal defense for men

is just as much an obligation as to fill
the office of district attorney for the
prosecution of crimes, or to provide a
elty solicitor to enforce health man-
dates and building restrictions,”

Mr. Tustin's appeal was seconded
by Charles I. Huges, who declared
“The legal aid society is the poor
man's lawyer and gives him the es-
sential assistance he cannot obtain
elsewhere.

PHOTOPLAY TECHNIQUE IN
A COLLEGE COURSE

Announcement is made that a
eourse in the technique of the moy-
{ng picture will be ineluded in the
curriculum of Columbia University
in New York City. The course is a
part of the Department of Engllsh
and was tried ont this summer with
signal success—so go the reports re-
eelved.

“The course is still] in an experi-
mental state,”’ says Dr. Hunt, who js
“What |
we are attempting ts to determine
for ourselves the value of the mo-
tion picture as an air to instru ton |
in biography, history and whatever

lend themselves to pic |
turlzation.

The course in the writing and
construction of the photoplay, given
under Mr. Patterson, take up the
motion pteture from on entirely dif
ferent angle.

“Wei are going to try
those students who show talent the
actual technical points connected
with the writing of photoplays,” sala
Mr. Patterson. ‘We have our labora-
tories for this right jn the motion
pictuye theatres of the city and in our
own classrooms, where from time to
time we show current films and at-
tempt to analyze them from all point
that could be of interest to writer
for the screen, This will inelude all of
the camera tricks and devices. The
student must have a pretty fair know
ledge of the limits and possibilities of
the camera, and use of the close-up,
}the fade-in and fade-out in the de-
| velopment of the story, adaption of
‘the story and dramatization of set-

to teach

women and children without means |

ting.”

BOWSER

‘(From Page One)
P. Reynolds saw his possibilities and
held him out of several important
games, and then put him jn on the
Hne in order to arouse him to his
greatest effort.

He stands todny as one of the
greatest fullbacks In the
He has been the outstanding indi-
vidual performer jn every game this
year,

“Bowser 1s an all-round football
player. His ability is not confined
to particular phases of the game, Ile
performs equally well as a kicker,
line-plunger, open-field runner, for-
ward passer and defensive man. His |
Hne plunging and open-field run-
ning are very spectacular. Seven of
his eight tonchdowns against Ur-
sinus and Muhlenburg were made by
straight line plunges, within their
10-yard lines, where the defense 1s
always the stiffest. The elghth was
made on a crossed signal, When he
found. himself in possession of the
ball, with no one to receive it from
him, and no interference, he dug out
for himelf, and unaided, tore thru
the entlre Muhlenburg team, shak-
ing off n half dozen tacklers and car-
rying the ball fifty-five yards to the
goal Hne.

Wis kicking ability allows oppo-
nents scant reason for any feeling of
seenrity. He sends kickoffs high into
the air and rarely drops them short
of the goal line, Wis punts re
usually forty-five or fifty yards, and
kicks the ball high enough to allow |
the ends ample time to get down the
field and dep the recelver in hts
tracks. His ability to accurately di-
rect placement ‘kleks between the

ARMISTICE DAY

From Page One

man,” “BUI” Irvin’ was the first te
reuch the neutral stage, followed
clesely by “Soup" Davis and Frank
Yownzend, Others gradually fell by
the wayside until “Red” Jones and
“Al” Mahoney were the only surviv-
ors. Lack of time and a surplus of
clothes prevented a fight to the fin-
ish. “Soup”? Davis’ Phi Gam adher-
ants rushed ta his ald with a bath-
robe, and the day was saved.

On the whole, the evening was the
best thing in the history of the col-
lege for the promotion of better fra-
ternity splrit, and may be added to
the already long Ust of events which
prove that Armistice Day was a com-
plete suecess,

Following the parade from the
Tustin Gyninasiuni consposed of the
Bucknell Band, students and cavalry
troops, a fltting celebration of Armis-
tice Day was held in the Baptist
Church at 10 o’elock in the morning.
A large crowd turned out to pay tri-
bute to the boys who so gallantly
served their country during the late
war.

President ‘'Diek'’ Mason of the

Senior Class was the presiding officer
of the meeting. The opening prayer
was made hy Rey. Peaeock, followed
by the singing of ‘America’ by the
audience,
, Dr. Hunt made the first address,
taking as his theme “What does
Arnilstice Day Really Mean.’ He said
{n part:

“We would all Hke to understand
the heart and the meaning of Armis-
tice Day. No one of us Knows how
much Armistice Day ought to mean
to us. Who knows what would have
been the situation if Armistice Day
had not come? If autocracy and mill-
tarism had conquered, what then?
Who of us can tell; but we can mere-
ly raise the qnestion, do something to
open our minds to the significance of
this great day.

What does it mean to everyone of
our men who were over there? No
one of us who was not over there can
pieture the feelings of the men
when they thought, ‘‘shall I ever see
the Statute of Liberty again; shall ¥
ever see the good old United States
again?’ And the morning of Novem-
ber 11th, two “years ago everyone of
our men over there felt that these
questions were answered far him, Be
fore that, every morning the questlon
was, what may happen to-day; to-day
may settle 1¢. The morning of Nov

we are not Guite so ¢ vuln that the:
are worth fighting for as we were b
fore. That means that we lost ground
to regain and nothing excep
loyaltgy to the truth will open th:
way for us into larger and higher
truth. That is just as true of the na-
tion

About twq generations ago an A-
n admiral cast anchor in the
harbor at Japan, He wsn’t invited. He
had distinct notice that this nation
was quite willing to remaln a hermit
nation, but the American represen-
tative was not willing that they
should and he had a heavier gun to
support hls point of view. That na-
tion which did not care to enter into
a treaty with any other natlon on
earth was induced, practically forced
to make a treaty, with the positive
would have equul treatment with th
most favored nations with which A
merica was then in treaty, When Cal
{fornia got Ured of the Chinese and
excluded them, they went to Japan
te kk labor, Then the state of Call-
tornia began to take the same atti-
ture toward the Japanese They
worked too hard and were too frugal
and saved their money too fa
There were 50,000 Japs in Califor
nla. They seemed to be afraid that
would swamp the state, The;
made so much fuss that the Japane
voluntarily stopped the Imm igration

absolute

meric

from Japan. Six months ago they stop |
which prevailed of |

ped the practice
permitting Japanese young women to
eome over to this country to be mar

d.

Lastly, a blank fact Is that at.th
recent election the people of Cali
fornla, by a very large majority,
voted to ‘refuse the ordinary rights of
itizens, of residents even, to Japa-
nese In California. Even the native-
born Ameriean children of these Jap-
enese shall not be permitted to hold

land in the state of Californian. This |
free country that’s the melting pot
of the nation with the equal right
and opportunity for All, I confess to
you I hang my head in’ shame, If
we're golng back on that policy, that
Frinciple, more than n policy, which
has been Amerlean, and resort to the
pelty, selfish method of living in this
world, we're laying up for ourselves
wrath against the day of wrath, anc
that nation, relatively inexperienced
