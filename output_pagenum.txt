. . .  Cheating
(Continued from page 6.) 
the strictest fashion is considered 
directly responsible for cheating in 
examinations.
A 
rather 
general 
assumption, 
therefore, seems to be this: a student 
will cheat when he has reason to do control, 
so (especially when he is under pres* ] that for 
he has the oppor-
sure) as long as 
lunity to do so.

On the other hand, most of the 
students interviewed displayed *a 
considerable sense of commitment to 
the student body as a whole. 
At 
least four out of five stated outright 
and emphatically that they will not 
inform on cheating fellow students 
whether 
the 
cheaters 
are 
friends or not. 
Repeatedly 
students stated: “The squealer is 
worse than the cheater.”

reason, we do not believe that an

burg features a sign in bold letters, “Welcome 
M l .
Freshmen.” 
Although upperclassmen are a bit 
more blase about their feelings, we need the vital 
spark contributed by an "enthusiastic freshman 
class.
Social events will take precedence at first with 
the usual round of fraternity parties, football 
games and the freshman dance. At the -same time, 
you will be starting an academic adventure of 
challenging courses taught by a variety of profes-
sors, all of whom demand your best work. 
The 
amount of studying required of you will be far 
greater than anything you have previously experi-
enced. 
The helpless feeling of how much you 
DON’T know will engulf you, as it does every stu-
dent.
Pinpointing each classroom experience, how-
ever, is the excitement of learning. 
Unlimited 
horizons of knowledge, which are yours for the 
pursuit, can and should be an enthralling part of 
your college career.
You will find that many upperclassmen are 
guilty of a crime which dulls the sharpest profes-
sor too quickly. Students who sit in stupors, ask-
ing no questions and never engendering discus-
sions, destroy the fire which should be lit and re-
kindled each time that students and professors 
meet. As incoming freshmen, you are challenged 
to retain your enthusiasm in the classroom and to 
seek the joy inherent in true learning.
Encountering new people who will absorb your 
time and thoughts is an essential in university life. 
Nothing can be more rewarding than penetrating 
the ideas of another individual, coming face to face 
with the bare core of that person. 
Take time to 
enjoy the exchange of perspectives to which the
isolated college community is so conducive. Give 
of yourself only to those groups which you find 
worthy of your participation.
But be alert for a danger whiph stalks all stu-
dents. The loss of that which is genuine may not 
worry you in the whirl of parties, pins and puns, 
but that value slips away far too easily. Borrow-
ing a few moments to live in review the events of 
each day helps to preserve one’s sanity and ac-
quaint him with himself.
You will change as a product of rapid exposure 
to new ideas and experiences. Don’t be afraid of 
what is happening to you, but continue to judge 
yourself critically. 
Everyone has a controlling 
hand in his own development; that grasp should 
be firm and sincere.
Shakespeare. has perhaps expressed it best in 
Hamlet, as Polonius advises his son Laertes:
“This above all,
To thine own self be true
And it must follow as the night the day;
Thou canst not then be false to any man.”

Dorms, Class Buildings 
Improved Since Spring
This summer m arked the be-
ginning of an extensive building 
and renovation program on the 
campus. 
In order to meet in-
creased enrollment, the fourth 
floor of Harris has been converted 
into residence quarters for 39 
women. On the ground floor of 
that building, rooms have been 
built for seven additional stu-
dents, including modem facilities 
and lounge space.
The 
University 
work 
crew, 
under the direction of W alter C. 
Geiger, installed non-combustible 
fire towers in Larison Hall and 
Harris Hall. 
The first floor of 
what was formerly Bucknell Cot-
tage and the third floor wing of 
Larison have been remodeled. ’ A 
section of Larison was re-design- 
ed and set aside for the use of the 
Women’s Infirmary Staff. 
New 
furniture has been put to use in 
the living rooms of Hunt Half, 
W alker and Stevens House.
Classroom Changes
In the line of improvements to 
classroom buildings, the most no-
ticeable change is the renovation 
of Taylor Hall. 
The third and 
fourth floors, which were previ-
ously used by the mathematics 
and. education departments, now 
provide additional space for the 
biology department. Biology stu-
dents will find there a large, com-
pletely modem laboratory with 
work tables and the latest in fa-
cilities. 
In the Vaughan Litera- 
tyre Building, changes include 
the redivision of the classics 
, seminar room and lounge to pro-
vide three new offices and one 
new seminar room.
Stadium Renovated 
The stadium has .also under-
gone a face lifting. 
In August i 
the work crew completed a new 
concession stand and finished re- 
building two sections of seats at 
Memorial Stadium. 
Additional 
improvements 
were 
made 
on 
roads and paths. The university j 
road, which previously started at I 
Memorial Stadium and ended at 
the Vaughan Literature building,! 
has been eliminated; a new park 
ing area has been installed be 
tween 
Davis 
Gymnasium 
and 
Bucknell Village on Moore Ave-
nue; several new campus paths 
have been . installed and many 
others resurfaced. 
New curbing 
has" been installed along Walker 
and Loomis Streets, the roads re-
surfaced, and new lighting stand-
ards have been erected. Seventy 
benches which were donated by 
the class of 1960 have been placed 
throughout the campus.
East College
Independent contractors han-
dled the renovation of East Col-
lege. 
Renovations costing ap-
proximately 
$530,000 
include 
modem furniture, modernization 
of the rooms and the addition of 
a lounge and recreation room.
While s\ill in the early stage of 
construction, the new Adminis-
tration Center should be ready 
for occupancy by June 1, 1960.

NUMBERS 763
Bucknell welcomed the largest 
| freshman class in its history on 
September 17, when more than 
1750 freshman men and women 
I arrived on the campus for a spe-
cial Freshman Week program.
Representing twenty states of 
! the Union, the District of Colum-
bia and Canada, the Bucknell 
Class of 1964 consists of 489 men 
and 274 women, surpassing the 
previous high in freshman enroll-
ments set last year.
Although Pennsylvania, New 
York and New Jersey have the 
largest number of freshman stu-
dents attending Bucknell this fall, 
i Connecticut, Massachusetts, Ohio 
and Maryland are also well rep-
resented.
Convocation exercises marking 
the formal opening of Bucknell’s 
fall semester and 115th academic 
year took place on Wednesday, 
September 21, when a student 
body of more than 2300 heard an 
address by Dr. Paul J. Tillich of 
Harvard University. Dr. Tillich, 
a noted author, teacher and theo-
logian, and Dr. Wayne C. Grover,
