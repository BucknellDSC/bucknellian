    program on the campus. In order to meet in creased enrollment, the fourth
    floor of Harris has been converted into residence quarters for 39 women. On
    the ground floor of that building, rooms have been built for seven
    additional stu dents, including modem facilities and lounge space. The
    University work crew, under the direction of W alter C. Geiger, installed
    non-combustible fire towers in Larison Hall and Harris Hall. The first floor
    of what was formerly Bucknell Cot tage and the third floor wing of Larison
    have been remodeled. ' A section of Larison was re-design- ed and set aside
    for the use of the Women's Infirmary Staff. New furniture has been put to
    use in the living rooms of Hunt Half, W alker and Stevens House. Classroom
    Changes In the line of improvements to classroom buildings, the most no

    finished re- building two sections of seats at Memorial Stadium. Additional
    improvements were made on roads and paths. The university j road, which
    previously started at I Memorial Stadium and ended at the Vaughan Literature
    building,! has been eliminated; a new park ing area has been installed be
    tween Davis Gymnasium and Bucknell Village on Moore Ave nue; several new
    campus paths have been . installed and many others resurfaced. New curbing
    has" been installed along Walker and Loomis Streets, the roads re surfaced,
    and new lighting stand ards have been erected. Seventy benches which were
    donated by the class of 1960 have been placed throughout the campus. East
    College Independent contractors han dled the renovation of East Col lege.
    Renovations costing ap proximately $530,000 include modem furniture,
    modernization of the rooms and the addition of a lounge and recreation room.
    While s\ill in the early stage of construction, the new Adminis tration

Content: The first point to be made is that the fact that you have taken the trouble to
    read the editorial page is an excellent sign. What you will be finding on
    this page is purely a matter of conjecture. Primarily it will be an attempt
    to point up a situation, a vital one, which none-the-less remained obscure.
    There will be criticism and piraise both, of students, faculty and

Content: i Contrary to general belief, col lege campuses are anything but deserted during

    at Buck -1 nell University prove. A total of 2,626 persons visited Bucknell
    during the summer for the purpose of attending either the summer institutes,
    special conferences, or the regular sum mer session. Conferences accounted
    for the largest number of visitors. Ac cording to Raymond K. Irwin,
    placement director and conference co-ordinator for the university, 1703
    persons attended the nine conferences held on the- campus. The figures do
    not include attend ance at several one-day confer ences which took place.
    Four of the conferences were conducted at Bucknell for the first time this
    year. They include the Conference on the Undergrad uate Training of
    Chemistry Ma jors, two five-day sessions spon sored by the Pennsylvania De
    partment of Highways, and the meeting of the Central Pennsyl vania Youth

Heading: AS MEMORIES FOND COME TROOPING BY
Content: by Jane Tilton Editor's Note: This column marks the first in a series devoted to
    the presentation of little known facts re garding the history of Bucknell.
    The information has been compiled from "The Centennial History of Bucknell
    University", a book written by Dr. Lewis Theiss, a former Bucknell professor
    who still resides in Lewisburg. Lewisburg 1840 Lewisburg is fast becoming a
    booming metropolis. Increased canal facilities have made the town easily
    accessible to travelers from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and other points
    along the Susquehanna. They are now able to reach Lewisburg by river travel,
    a trip that is a comfortable one, but by necessity a leisurely one. (Express
    boat to Lewisburg are currently limited by law to a speed of four miles per
    hour). Furthermore, with the completion of a series of canals, cargo traffic
    has increased. Lewisburg has become a thriving port for the shipment of
    goods to other parts of the country. Hardly a day passes now without a
    steady progression of wagons from the mountains carrying large supplies of
    surplus grains, lumber, hides, and other products to the port. Due to the
    increase in trade, local industry is fast oq the rise. Several new
    foundries, tanneries, mills, and boat yards have recently been established.
    The population has risen to 1220 persons. Perhaps the best way of realizing
    the extent of the development in this area is to compare the Lewisburg of
    today with the town as it was in 1813. The population in those days was a
    mere 250 persons. Industry was confined to one primitive nail factory and,
    two very small tanneries. There were no churches then, but seven taverns, a
    distillery, and a brewery were very much in existence. The taxes collected
    that year came to only $98.88. Trading as we have come to know it today did
    not even exist. It seems incredible that so much progress could be achieved
    in so short a period. But the facts indicate that Lewisburg is well on its
    way to becoming one of the top ports in the area. cers Association, the
    Pennsyl vania Bankers Trust Training | School, the Pennsylvania Bankers
    Association Summer School, the Bank Directors Conference of the Pennsylvania
    Bankers Associa -1 tion, and the annual meeting of Pennsylvania Baptist
    Laymen. Largest of the institutes held at Bucknell this summer was the In -1
    stitute for Foreign Students, with 99 students representing 34 [ foreign '
    countries attending the | eight-week program. Other institutes conducted
    over six-week periods during the sum mer included the Institute of American
    Studies, the Institute for Asian Studies^ the Summer Institute for High
    School Teach ers of Science and Mathematics, the Institute for High School
    Science Students, and the Sum-1 mer Institute in the Engineering j Sciences.

Heading: Good Standing
Content: Out of the 128 students whose return in September was condi tioned upon their
    coming to sum mer school, 36 completely restor ed themselves to good
    standing. An additional 47 students met the specific requirement that was
    stated for them and have return ed on warning this fall. Ten additional
    students did not fully meet their requirements during the summer session,
    but were permitted to return on the basis of an extended warning. These
    exceptions were made be cause their summer work indicat ed an ability to
    raise themselves to good standing within one se mester, and their cumulative
    | grade point averages are within a reasonable distance of the good standing
    requirement.

Content: Today, if I am a little misty, who can blame me? For today I begin my seventh
    year of writing columns for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes. Seven years!
    Can it be possible? It seems only yesterday I walked into the Marlboro
    offices, my knickers freshly pressed, my cowlick wetted down, my oilcloth
    pencil box clutched in my tiny hand. "Sirs," I said to the makers of
    Marlboro--as handsome an aggregation of men as you will find in a month of
    Sundays, as agreeable as the cigarettes they make--mild yet hearty, robust
    yet gentle, flip-top yet soft pack Sirs,

Content: said to this assemblage of honest tobacconists, " I have come to wrjte a column
    for Marlboro Cigarettes in college newspapers across the length and breadth
    of this great free land of America. We shook hands then-silently, not
    trusting ourselves to speak--and one of the makers whipped out a harmonica
    and we sang sea chanties and bobbed for apples and played Run, Sheep, Run,"
    and smoked good Marlboro Cigarettes until the campfire had turned to embers.
    "What will you write about in your column?" asked one of the makers whose
    name is Trueblood Strongheart.

Content: "About the burning issues that occupy the lively minds of college America," I
    replied. "About such vital questions as: Should the Studfent Council have
    the power to levy taxes? Should proctors be armed? Should coeds go out for
    football?" " And will you say a kind word from time to time about Marlboro
    Cigarettes," asked one of the makers whose name is Honor Bright. " Why,
    bless you, sirs," I replied, chuckling silverly, ' there is no other kind of
    word except a kind word to say about Marlboro Cigarettes--the filter
    cigarette with the unfiltered taste--that happy combination of delicious
    tobacco and ex clusive selectrate filter--that loyal companion in fair
    weather or foul--that joy of the purest ray serene." There was another round
    of handshakes then and the makers squeezed my shoulders and I squeezed
    theirs and then we each squeezed our own. ^ id  then I hied me to my
    typewriter and began the first of seven years of columning for the makers of
    Marlboro Cigarettes. And today as I find myself once more at my typewriter,
    once more ready to begin a new series of columns, perhaps it would be well
    to explain my writing methods. I use the term "writing methods" advisedly
    because I am, above all things a methodical writer. I do not wait for the
    muse; I work every single day of the year, Sundays and holidays included. I
    set myself a daily quota and I don't let anything prevent me from achieving
    it. My quota, to be sure, is not terribly difficult to attain (it is, in
    fact, one word per day) but the important thing is that I do it every single
    day. This may seem to yotl a grueling schedule but you must remember that
    some days are relatively easy-- for example, the days on which I write "the"
    or "a" . On these days I can usually finish my work by noon and can devote
    the rest of the day to happy pursuits like bird-walking, monopoly, and
    smoking Marlboro Cigarettes. deg (c)  1960 Max Shulman * * * The makers of

Content: Despite an inexperienced line and a poor first half the 1960 edi tion of the
    Bucknell football team stomped on Muhlenberg last Sat urday 45-7 in a pre-
    season scrim mage. The Bisons rolled up 38 points in the second half as they
    gave an exciting preview of the offensive power which w ill be on display
    tomorrow night at Her shey Stadium. Just about every back on the team got
    into the scoring act. A ll four quarterbacks found the range as All-Confer
    ence Paul Terhes passed for one touchdown and ran 20 yards to tally a
    second. Doug Williams and Ron Giordano, both sophs, as well as senior Rick
    Elliott, found targets, while soph Dick Johnson rambled 61 yards to add to
    the Mules misery. Williams ended the game by sneaking over from two yards
    out with only seconds remaining. While neither team was partic ularly active
    in the first half, the Bisons appeared to be a different squad when they
    took the field for the second stanza. Since there were no kickoffs, each
    team taking the ball on their own 30- yard line after a score, Bucknell had
    only to go 70 yards in twelve plays to get their offensive steam- d tl d

    the only members of the 41-man squad who did not see action. Sorely needing
    greater depth at several positions Odell and his staff have made quite a few
    position changes since last fall. Junior Tom Alexander, a center last year
    is now a starting guard where his speed is utilized to a greater advantage.
    Junior Jake Flyzik has been moved from guard to center and junior Kirk
    Foulke is back at tackle, his 1959 position, after playing at center in
    spring practice. Garrity and West, both quarterbacks until last week,
    surprised as running half backs. Both boys weigh only 150 pounds. Pat
    Malone, a letter winner at halfbgck last fall, has been moved to end to help
    fill in for graduation losses. Tom Noteware, a fullback as a freshman, an
    end last year and a center for the first two weeks of fall practice has been
    moved to tackle to make room for sopho more pivot men Dean Stump of
    Johnstown, Pa. and George Rieu of Atlantic City, N. J. Both boys have
    impressed in early practice work with Stump expected to get the starting nod
    in the opener against Gettysburg on Saturday. In the other big position
    change junior Bill Urch, a letterman at halfback as a sophoore, has been
    switched to fullback to fill in for the loss of Captain-elect George
    Moncilovich. Mono, the Bisons' leading ground gainer last year, was declared
    ineligible under a special N C A A  ruling governing transfer students.
    consequently there w ill be a lot of experienced beef, at least on the first
    team. Kirk Foulke, Tom Alexander, Denny Morgan, and Don Chaump are all
    vastly im-, proved and as long as they can keep a sharp edge in each game,
    the Bison line will be as solid ?is its ever been. Naturally, these four
    won't be expected to go the full sixty, but while there is a lot of weight
    on the reserves, experi ence s not at an all time high. The tentative
    starting lineup for tomorrow night's clash w ill consist of Terhes at
    quarterback, Ashton Ditka and Captain Mickey Melberger at the halfbacks with
    Ken twiford holding down the fullback slot. At the ends will be Malone and
    Maslanik, while Chaump and Alexander will be the guards. With Morgan and
    Foulke at the tackles, sophomore Dean Stump will handle the cen ter spot.

    "Pardon me, but do you know if Miss Kranich is around?" "I am she," she
    replied. So began my interview with Miss Dorothy Kranich, the new dean of
    sophomore women. Miss Kranich, easily mistaken for a student, is just that.
    She did her undergraduate research at Gettysburg College and is com pleting
    graduate work at Ohio State University in guidance and counseling. Her home
    is in Glen Cove, Long I Island, New York, and before ar riving on the
    Bucknell campus two weeks ago she did counseling work in a dormitory at Ohio
    State. Viewing Bucknell, she com mended the friendly atmosphere of the
    campus. #Her main worry was that the new fourth floor of Harris, nick named
    the Harris Hilton, would not be completed. She stated that all the girls
    seem to be happy with their rooms, for no matter where you are, "dormitories
    are dormitories." She has had no problems with the girls, but then
    "sophomores are worldly-wise." I'm afraid I put her on the spot when I
    asked, "Who will you root for at the Bucknell-Gettysburg game?" Her answer:
    "I guess I'll have to be a quiet spectator. I won't dare open my mouth!"

    today. That conformity which so many modem writers condemn produces a lack
    of freedom des troying creativity. We are chain ed not by law, but rather by
    me chanically spontaneous responses to life. Man, claims Tillich, can be |
    creative only when he is able to ! listen. His mind must be open, ! for
    knoWledge cannot enter a locked compartment. Life is "mysterious and open,
    profound and on the surface, sublime and profane". It is a series of un
    solved paradoxes. As is life, so is Man. Since equal attracts equal, any
    object can be a med ium through which the Eros can be achieved.

Heading: Three Types
Content: Tillich discussed three types of "Creative Listening": the Aca demic,
    Conversational, and Lis tening to Ourselves. So often the college student
    never really lis tens. He goes through college waiting for the stimulating
    pro fessor, the outstanding course; he fails to realize that the Eros is
    found instead in Reality itself. We can be creative only when we can be open
    to the Reality, only when we can experience it. Crea tive education can
    never be a passive experience; instead it mu?t be a matter of personal con
    cern. Only when we experience this concern or the will to change what we
    learn, can creativity exist. Creative listening can and does take place in
    interaction between persons. Typical college conver sations usually do more
    to hinder than help the process. However, since gossip, quick, concise, to
    the point answers, technical consider ations and the recollection of en
    tertaining tidbits are ofttimes a polite way of preventing a real union.
    This union becomes possible only when silence has become possible, "an
    exchange of thoughts through silence". When this union has taken place,
    creative listening can be utilized even in superficial conversation. It be
    comes a method by which we can listen to what a person is trying to say,
    rather than what he ac tually would seem to communi cate Finally Dr. Tillich
    in his dis cussion of Listening to Ourselves pointed out that in each of us
    there are voices which point to the sublime. These voices are I those which
    force us to ask ques tions about the meaning of real ity. They serve to
    raise us from complacency and force us to ex amine and to strive for the an
    swers to these disturbing ques tions. They force us to listen and think
    creatively! Modem life, however, has be- | come too busy. Man can shut the 1
    voice out in the trivial details of daily existence. If the human | race
    ever succeeds in killing this j voice, it will, with the same bul- I let,
    destroy creativity. Instead of the usual convoca- | tion statements full of
    idealistic j messages about studying harder ! and being well rounded,

    planning the first editions of "our new baby". The last week has been busy
    but rewarding, culminating in the presentation of this new paper. In this
    first issue, we share with all Bucknell- ians, old and new, the exciting
    steps leading to the birth of an issue. Every issue of the

Heading: Bucknellian
Content: has its beginning in weekly edi torial staff meetings. Under the direction of
    Editor-in-Chief Jan Powers, the staff plans each edi tion two weeks in
    advance. Ideas fo r good news stories, pictures, features, and editorials
    are tossed I back and forth. "Hot tips" in evitably come to the fore.
    Sometimes it is difficult to dis tinguish this staff meeting from that of a
    debating society. Often I there are animated discussions, producing some
    fire works, before the staff can agree about the "stand" that will be taken
    on a controversial topic. Finally, the j lead stories and a general idea of
    page layout are decided upon and the meeting is adjourned. News Gathered
    Story assignments for a coming | issue filter down from the editors to
    writers, reporters and cub re- porters. Bucknellians from all I classes
    enjoy interviewing and getting .better acquainted with I faculty, other
    students, and vari ous newsworthy personalities. No I one is more excited
    than a re porter who discovers that he has 1 been assigned the "scoop of the
    week". After all the information is gathered, the newsmonger sits down to
    the challenging task of fitting the facts together into an interesting piece
    of copy. Eight o'clock Sunday night is the dead line when all reporters
    deposit their creative efforts into the

Heading: Bucknellian
Content: box in Harris Hall. Here the job of the reporter tomorrow becomes today in the
    ever-pressing race against the deadline. Between Monday and Wednesday the
    linotyper sets and prints all copy on long, pink "gal ley sheets." Masses of
    copy read ers descend upon the office to correct two sets of these galleys.
    I The remaining galley sheets are placed at the disposal of various editors
    to be cut and pasted. It would be a great boon for j all editors to have a
    Ph. D. in put- ing together jigsaw puzzles; for that is exactly what making-
    up a "dummy" page Entails. Both Wednesday and Thursday the page editors and
    their assistants spend hours arranging galleys and pasting them onto dummy
    sheets. On Wednesday the editorial page, feature pages, and page | three are
    laid out to be printed on Thursday. The sports page, front page and page
    eight are laid out on Thursday and are printed Friday. The aim of each
    editor is to f have just enough copy, so as to avoid the use of
    uninformative I fillers, and to arrange it with some degree of symmetry. The
    I final task of the layout chore is 1 to write headlines. The trick to I
    writing headlines is to make j them clever, and to see that they j "fit" in
    the column space. Often the editors have to fore go a dazzliing headline:
    Bucknell 1 Eleven Wins Sixth of Season, in favor of a title that will fit:
    Buck- nell Trips Army 49-0! When the \ headlines are finished the page is j
    "wrapped up". And when all j dummy pages are completed on | Thursday night,
    the editors have j put the "Buckley to bed" for an other week. It remains
    only for Mr. Focht # and his printers to grind the i presses so that the
    circulation! staff may distribute stacks of | news to the campus on Fridays.

Heading: Debatable Debate
Content: Pitched in the first of a series of four televised debates, Senator John F.
    Kennedy and Vice-President Richard F. Nixon played marbles with political
    trivia for an hour Wednesday night. In his opening statement about America's
    standstill, Kennedy spoke glibly of rights due a Negro baby born in this
    country. Nixon countered Kennedy's statement with the declaration that
    America was on the move and had been so for the past seven and a half years.
    He did not touch on the question of civil rights at any time during the
    evening. More than half of the program time consisted of replies to
    questions formulated by four representatives from sponsoring networks. One
    reporter confronted Nixon with President Eisenhower's remark that he could
    think of nothing contributed by Nixon during his term of office. Rising to
    the occasion with equanimity, Nixon countered his ipquisitor with the
    assurance that Ike's remark was merely facetious, for he could not possibly
    reveal the identity of his advisors. Dulling a barbed question, this
    repartee was as dazzling as the glittering generalities of "freedom" and
    "progress" which dripped like sticky honey from Kennedy's tongue. What was
    the good of these debates? Neither man concerned himself with major issues
    of party or country. Vying with each other to- present the most
    scintillating image of potential presidency, both candidates fingered
    cliches with surprising ease. On a stark stage, Peck's Bad Boy extolled the
    virtues of a democratic platform surprisingly similar to that of the
    Republicans, described in words from the cadaverous face of the vice
    president. Having no audience reaction to play their words against, Kennedy
    and Nixon struggled to appear keen opponents of each other. The result was
    an ineffectual discussion, leaving the viewer with little or nothing on
    which to base his allegi ance. The candidates took no distinct stands on
    major issues, sallying instead from side to side in an attempt to pick up
    votes. Even traditional party ideologies were absent from their speeches.
    Compromising for the sake of votes has reduced the level of competition to
    the per sonal appeal of Kennedy versus that of Nixon. We would hope that the
    next three debates, scheduled for October 7, 13 and 21, will show that the
    two candi dates have committed themselves to stands on major is sues. Surely
    Nixon can speak of living standards in terms less emotional than, "poverty I
    have known." Similarly, Kennedy's "rendezvous with destiny" seems hardly the
    campaign note of a Nobel Prize winner. All this excitement at G-burg Reminds
    me Of the big battle there when my great grandmother Was living in the hills
    of Lewisburg. Do we still have a Union? Elections? I'd forgotten about
    elections completely Until I heard some professors The other day Talking
    about some convention with nominations and all. I think this must be
    election year. What happened to voting laws? Can't students 21 vote any
    more? Or do they Vote like cool Daddy says to? I haven't noticed any
    interest in Reading The New York Times (Oh my, I committed a horrible sin--I
    mentioned a competitor of the Bucknellian.) Also-- What happened to "bull
    sessons" on politics? I've heard a lot about a Terhes But I think he's doing
    a different kind Of running. Students have been yelling for So long About

Heading: Registration Runaround
Content: Any student who waited for forty-five minutes in line for Registration was
    justified in his grumblings about this necessary evil. The procedure was
    simple: (1) Receive student ID cards; (2) fill out address cards for
    switchboard and handbook use; (3) pick up treasurer's release slip; (4)
    obtain registration envelope. Why did it take each stu dent at least half an
    hour to go through these four steps? (We will not comment on the further
    time required for those who had schedule changes.) At the risk of becoming
    self-named efficiency experts, we would suggest several changes which might
    vastly improve the efficiency of the registration procedure. Name and
    address cards could be mailed in advance and returned prior to registration
    day. Perhaps including these cards in the registration envelope, with
    directions to fill them out before leaving the gym, would also elim inate
    some confusion and minimize the time spent in reg istration. Retarding the
    process most, however, was a lack of per sonnel prepared to handle the
    registration influx. Sure ly, more student help could be utilized at such
    points as the ID card pick-up station, and in the distribution of name and
    address cards, treasurer's release cards and class schedules. By further
    dividing the line alphabeti cally at each of these points, waiting time
    could be re duced considerably. Furthermore, an early registration for
    counselors, proc tors, head residents, WSGA officers, and athletic team
    members was planned to include far too many people for the time allotted to
    them. Granting special registration rights for every group requesting it
    resulted in sev eral delays throughout the procedure. Perhaps the num ber of
    groups should be limited. Pre-registration of class schedules, as we now
    have it, is commendable. However, we should not overlook the fact that the
    remaining registration procedure, as it stands now, could be more efficient.

Content: by Jane Tilton October 5, 1849 It has been three years since the University at
    Lewisburg has been operating here. It is an institution that promises to
    grow into one of the top schools in the nation. Last year the trustees
    feeling that their efforts far obtaining sub scriptions would be successful
    built the first building on the college grounds. (Classes were previously
    held in the Baptist Church). With the completion of Taylor Hall, the
    university was able to instigate still another first in its history, coed
    classes. The measure while still a radical one in college circles is a
    sensible one. The girls occupy the west side of one of the large rooms on
    the second floor of Taylor Hall and must face the West at all times, the
    young men are confined to the east side of the room and similiarly are
    required to face the East. In commenting on the monumental advances that
    have been made here in the past three years, Dr. Taylor has released the
    follow ing statement: "Three years ago last November we commenced with abso
    lutely nothing. At the date of this record, October 1, 1849 we are permitted
    under the blessing of Heaven to witness the fol lowing results: A University
    Charter obtained, a farrn of seventy acres in the Borough of Lewisburg, now
    valued at $12,000, belonging to the trustees and affording as good a site
    for the University as can be found between the Atlantic and the Pacific, a
    substantial brick edifice erected at an expense of $8,000; a well organized
    and dis ciplined school, having in its Primary Dept, eleven students, in the
    English Dept., eighty-two and in the Classical Dept., seventy- one, of whom
    twenty-eight are prepared for the Senior Academic Class, twelve for the
    Freshman class, thirteen for the Sophomore class and six for the Junior
    class. The amount of tuition fees for the year ending August 24, 1849 being
    $2,125.12, the number of faculty members during the former year two, during

    ROTC if it were not com pulsory?" The cadets were in structed to answer the
    question "yes" or "no" and then to add any remarks they desired. The results
    showed that 61% favored the ROTC program, 29% were not in favor of the
    program, and 10% were undecided or pre ferred training in some branch other
    than the Army. According to the accompanying remarks, the greatest cause of
    disfavor for the course was that it consumed val uable study time from
    academic subjects. Others answered nega tively, stating, "The time served
    does not reduce one's military ob ligation," and declared, "There Was a lack
    of information con cerning the details of the program prior to our
    entrance." Those who favored the program (Continued on Page 10)

Heading: THE PLEDGE YOU SAVE
Content: 

Heading: MAY BE YOUR OWN
Content: Today's column is directed at those young female under graduates who have
    recently pledged sororities and are wor ried, poor lambs, that they won't
    make good. Following is a list of simple instructions which, if faithfully
    observed, will positively guarantee that you will be a mad success as a
    sorority girl. First, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The
    housemother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You must treat her with
    respect. When you wish to speak to her, address her as " Mother Sigafoos" or
    " Ma'am." In no circum stances must you say, "Hey, fat lady." Second, let us
    discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on the front porch of the sorority
    house. This is unsightly and shows a want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.
    Third, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing meals for a
    houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your cook goes to a great deal
    of trouble to make your menu varied and nourishing. The least you can do is
    show your apprecia tion. Don't just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim
    with delight, " What delicious pork jowls!" or " What a yummy soup bone!" or
    " What scrumptious fish heads!" or " What clear water!" Fourth, clothing.
    Never forget that your appearance re- # fleets not just on yourself but on
    the whole house. It was well enough before you joined a sorority to lounge
    around campus in your old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now you must
    take great pains to dress in a manner which excites admiring comments from
    all who observe you. A few years ago, for example, there was a Chi Omega
    named Camille Ataturk at the University of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to
    all her sorors. Camille hit on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb to
    the class she was attending. For instance, to English Lit she wore a buskin
    and jerkin. To German she wore lederhosen and carried a stein of pilsener.
    To Econ she wore 120 yards of ticker tape. Her shiningest hour came one day
    when she dressed as a white mouse for Psych Lab. Not only her Chi Omega
    sisters, but the entire student body went into deep mourning when she was
    killed by the janitor's cat. Finally, let us take up the most important
    topic of all. I refer, of course, to dating. As we have seen, the way you
    dress reflects on your sorority, but the men you date reflect even more. Be
    absolutely certain that your date is an acceptable fellow. Don't beat about
    the bush; ask him point-blank, "Are you an acceptable fellow?" Unless he
    replies, "Yeah, hey," send him packing. But don't just take his word that he
    is acceptable. Inspect him closely. Are his fingernails clean? Is liis black
    leather jacket freshly oiled? Is his ukelele in tune? Does he carry public
    liability insurance? And, most significant of all, does he smoke Marlboros?
    If he's a Marlboro man, you know he has taste and discern ment, wit and
    wisdom, character and sapience, decency and warmth, presence and poise,
    talent and grit, filter and flavor, soft pack and flip-top box. You will be
    proud of him, your sorority will be proud of him, the makers of Marlboro
    will be proud of him, and I will be paid for this column. 4(c). 1960 M ax
    Shulmao The makers of Marlboro, having paid for this column, would like to
    mention another of their fine cigarettes -- mild, un filtered Philip Morris
    --available in regular size or the sensa tional new king-size Commander.

    of seiors who convinced their class to donate their class gift for the
    purpose1 of founding a group to bring to this campus speakers of interest to
    the college commun ity. The goal of the Student Forum is to introduce the
    college community to matters currently of concern to our society and to
    stimulate them to discuss and consider thoughtfully the ques tions raised.
    Last year, the Forum presented programs on Negro voting rights, censorship
    of literature, corrup tion in labor unions, the future of avant-garde
    theatre in Ameri ca, and "An American Commun ist Looks at American Democ
    racy." Currently, the Forum plans to present this year a program in each of

Heading: FROM THE SIDELINE
Content: Foggy weather didn't stop a well-trained Bucknell soccer team from scoring a
    stunning 6-2 vic tory over the hooters of Penn State last Saturday. The win
    was especially gratifying to coach 'Hank Peters, who had only 18 men to work
    with and had to fill four .of five backfield positions, thanks to
    graduation. The Bisons dominated the first quarter with a surprising offen
    sive. With six minutes gone in the first period, co-captain Bob Schad let go
    with a terrific blast that sailed 35 yards into the net. Twelve minutes
    later sophomore I Bill Dahl sent one into the cords | as Bucknell went ahead
    2-0. Penn State found themselves I in the unaccustomed position of j being
    two goals behind, and mo mentarily played inspired ball, but their threat
    was adequately contained by the Bisons. After | ten minutes of the second
    period, j State scored, but Dahl # kicked in I another shot to make the
    score 3-1. In the third session both teams held the ball about the same
    amount of time, each side kicking I a goal. Lyman Ott kicked in his I first
    of two during the period. (Continued on Col. 5) * * * * * * *fr * T4* ** *i*

    4* by Steve Chaump Injured Bucknell's semi-dramatic vie- j tory over
    Gettysburg last Satur-1 day night may well have been a costly." one. Junior
    guard Don Chaump, from West Pittston, Pa., was helping on a tackle on the
    B-Burg 10 yajd line when he sus tained an injury that will prob ably knock
    him out for the rest of the season. "Chaumper's" leg was broken below the
    knee. The bone was broken completely, but in such a way that there was no
    separaton, and thereby no setting required. By the time trainer Hal Biggs
    had arrived at the hos pital where Don was taken by ambulance, the massive
    guard was already in a cast. He return ed to classes Tuesday, but will
    probably remain out of action for the remainder of the season. Don will be a
    real loss to Buck nell as he was counted upon to handle guard duty
    extensively this season. He lettered last year and is deeply respected for
    his hard-hitting brand of football. He had even been slated for pos sible
    MAC honors. Senior John ! Aucker will probably be picked j to, fill Chaump's
    shoes, with soph- ! omore Chuck Johnson giving him ! support. Eleven Punts
    Bucknell's game with Gettys- | burg was semi-dramatic in that I while there
    were some interesting ! and unusual plays made, the con- i test was for the
    most part drud gery for both fans and players, i The show featured 11 punts.
    The Bisons were dogged with ! frustration during most of the I second
    quarter. They just couldn't i find the range when they got be neath the goal
    past's shadow. I Coach Bob Odell played two full Skinner teams extensively
    and both got an opportunity to score. Among the odd plays that came up in
    the game, besides Tom Alexander's mystifying punt, was Bob Williams'
    interception of a Gettysburg pass. Williams, a linebacker, dropped back a
    few yards and picked off Earl Little's aerial. Staring at the football
    unbelievingly for a split second, Williams then started up the field. Fpr
    ten yards or so he looked like a full-fledged full back, but then suddenly
    you knew he was a lineman. Bob's spark ling play went for naught how ever as
    the Bisons were forced to punt four plays later. Odds and Ends Soph lineman
    Dick Orlowski suffered the plight of many near sighted juggemaughts. He
    thought he lost one of his contact lenses at the end of the first half. He
    found it underneath his eye- I'lid. Two Gettysburg punts land- ! ed 6" over
    the goal line. Had I they stayed in play the Bisons would have been in real
    trouble. As it was they got the ball on their own twenty. Ken Twiford !ended
    the game on a spectacular note. He intercepted a pass on j the G-Burg 40
    yard line and head ed for home, only to fumble on Gettysburg's 20. Two
    desperation passes by the Bullets and it was all over. "Turk" completed 5 of
    11 passes for 51 yards More than 600 commercial FM stations, plus 155
    educational FM stations, are now broadcasting in this country. The cost of
    medical care in the U. S. has increased by 50% in ten vears. This is twice

    about five minutes remained in the contest when the 5-10 junior suddenly

Content: Bisons their first victory of the young 1960 season. Twiford, Johnson Shine
    Fullback Ken Twiford and soph halfback Dick Johnson also sparkled for
    Bucknell. Twiford made the key play of the game when he caught a Paul Terhes
    pass and moved 16 yards down to the Gettysburg 45 yard line in that late
    touchdown drive. The Bisons were faced with a third- and-thirteen situation
    when Twi ford came through in the clutch. Dick Johnson electrified Her shey
    stadium with a magnificent 36 yard run to tally Bucknell's first touchdown
    late in the-second period. The fleet soph halfback looked every part the
    veteran as he caught a pass from Terhes in the flat and headed for the
    sidelines. Only inches from the out-of- bounds marker he skirted two G-Burg
    defenders, picked up a fine block thrown by Tom Note- ware, and cut towards
    midfield. With the aid of blacks by Chuck Johnson, Dick Tyrrell, and John
    Sommers, he crossed the goal line standing up. Dick then proceed ed to boot
    the extra point, and then following with the kickoff. Although the score ran
    14-7, the Bisons threatened three times in the second quarter before finally
    scoring on Johnson's run. Each time they pushed to within the ten yard line
    and tach time they were repulsed. Alexander's Punt Gettysburg tallied their
    lone TD under unusual circumstances. On a fourth down situation in the third
    period junior Tom Alexan der received a high pass from center. The ball
    flipped out of his reach and when he finally picked it up on his own 15 yard
    line he was surrounded by Bullet defenders. Breaking loose, he got off a
    wobbly kick which end Ron Maslanik mistook for a forward pass. Maslanik had
    his back to the play and turned around just in time to grab the ball. He
    gain ed about 10 yards before being brought down by Gettysburg. When the
    smoke and confusion had cleared Gettysburg had the ball on Bucknell's 23
    yard line. Since the play had started on the BU 38,, the Bisons lost the
    ball and 15 yards as they were tagged with illegal procedure. Bullet

Heading: CORNELL PREVIEW
Content: As Coach Lefty James, sends his Cornell eleven onto the gridiron this Saturday
    afternoon he may be somewhat less than nostalgic at the prospect of meeting
    his alma mater. An end under Buck- nell's Carl Snavely from 1927 to 1930,
    Lefty has come to be known as one of the "most accomplished leaders in the
    game." It would seepi as though the Big Red could use an accomplish-I ed
    leader at this point. Highly touted in the pre-season coverage, Cornell now
    seems crippled al most beyond repair. Senior Marcy Tino, who was last year's
    starting quarterback, was slated along with junior D^ve McKelvey to_do big
    things for the men of Ithaca. Coach James uses a slot-T offense. After
    altemat- ng McKelvey and Tino at the quarterback spot last year he found
    that he was wasting tal ent, and so shifted Tino over to left halfback and
    put McKelvey at quarterback permanently. Or so he thought. All this must
    have made every one at Ithaca very happy. Also, in addition to the fast,
    hard hit ting Tino and the smooth accur ate passing McKelvey, there were 18
    lettermen returning and sev eral promising sophomores com ing up. Cornell
    looked, forward to bettering last year's 5-4 record.

Heading: Tino Injured
Content: Last week they carried Marcy Tino off the field. At 195 pounds Tino was the
    team's main running threat. He will be out the bet ter part of the season.
    Last Saturday Cornell met Col- | gate and ran into some more bad luck.
    Before the end of the first | quarter they helped Dave M cK el-! vey off the
    field, and before the i half Colgate had scored four | touchdowns and
    completely throf-! tied the Cornell offensive ma - 1 chine. In the second
    half Cor nell was to come back enough to score once and pile up more yard
    age on the ground and in the air than Colgate, but the game ended in a 28-8
    victory for a team that last year won only twice and this j year has lost
    almost its entire line. But no matter how humiliating: this opening defeat
    may be, the i Big Red will not slink into this Saturday's game wth its tail
    b e -: tween its legs. Tino and McKel- vey were considered as one of the
    best combinations in the Ivy League. They may be out, but 18 j lettermen
    covering all positions! remain. If James can develop a | pair of operational
    ends, Cornell can spring back. One answer is ! last season's regular slot
    back, | John Beggs, a senior who has had experience at end. Another may be
    Lewisburg's John Fenton who started several games last season.

Heading: Feeney Hurt
Content: Missing this year will be Dave Feeney, an all-Ivy guard in 1959. His able
    replacement will be cap tain Warren Sundstrom. Sund- strom has exceptional
    speed and has been outstanding as a line backer. As for the question of the
    back- field, the answer may be Bob Ritz who took over for McKelvey last
    Saturday or any one of several other understudys. George Telesh will be
    starting at fullback. He is a quick starter and a hard run ner with good
    speed, and Coach James will no doubt be counting heavily on him. James'
    revised Slot-T depends more on speed than previously. The right halfback
    used to be chiefly a blocker, but now runs the ball and catches passes.
    George Ekstrom who has run the 60 yard dash in 6.2 seconds and who last year
    averaged 4.8 yards per carry fills this key position. Along with Telesh, he
    is possibly one of the few bright spots in the Cornell backfield.

    drove for 36 yards in six carries as the Bucknell team marched 80 yards in

    Cosgrove was named "Back of the Game" by the members of the press. Frank

    Nan The most important problem I had to face was that of getting the
    Fischer. books I would need put into a form which I could use.
    ---------------- Of three possible methods, the first is to have the book
    recorded on records called "Talking-Books" . For reading courses this I find
    is the best way of having my books prepared. There are various volunteer
    organizations to which I send the books I need recorded. The second way is
    to have the book put into braille. To tell you exactly what braille is would
    be rather an involved operation, and I do not believe I could make myself
    clear as to how braille works just by using the printed word. If you would
    like to know about braille, ask me and I will gladly show you its operation.
    | There are not too many organizations which are equipped to do brailling.
    Since braille is very bulky, it requires immense space to store even one
    book. But braille is the best way to prepare a Math, book. Unfortunately, I
    was not able to get my Math books brailled last year and so had to rely on
    other books that were in braille and on readers. The third way of getting my
    books is just to have someone read . them to me. This naturally takes up a
    great deal of time, but it can be very useful both to me and to the reader.
    No matter how many books I can get recorded or brailled, there are always
    some which it is just impossible to record within the time limit of a
    semester, and therefore I must rely on some reader service. Here is where I
    would like to call on some of you for assistance. If any of you have a few
    hours a week to spare and would like to do a good deed for the day, perhaps

Content: by Lynne Coffin The most recent Gallup Poll, published in the Washington Post
    and Times Herald on Friday, Sep tember 23, shows that voters be tween the
    ages of 21 and 29 are 2-to-l in favor of Kennedy over Nixon. Why should we,
    the gen eration which will, in a short while be leading the world, be
    overwhelmingly for Kennedy and the Democratic Party? The Democratic Party
    has tra ditionally been the party of pro gress and reforms while the Re
    publicans have consistently been more conservative and have tried to
    maintain the "status quo." To day, with the prestige of the United States
    abroad at an al most all-time low, with public welfare such as schools and
    health-aid for the aged crying for attention, and with two recessions in
    four years and a third predict ed for this year, it seems natural that we
    should want to change the status quo. During the en suing weeks before
    November 8, I shall try to briefly discuss sev eral of the numerous areas in
    which the Democrats wish to make improvements over the last seven sterile
    and stultifying years of Republican rule. Democratic Spenders A  familiar
    criticism of the Democratic Party, voiced by the uneducated ever since the
    days of the New Deal, has been that the Democrats are spenders while the
    Republicans, due to the prepond- by David Baird On November 8, millions of
    Americans will go to the polls to elect the next President of the United
    States. My ballot is go ing to be marked for Richard M. Nixon for President
    and Henry Cabot Lodge for Vice President. This is probably the easiest
    aspect of voting. More difficult is de ciding why one would vote for the
    Republican candidates. The Republican ticket is one which counts on the
    experience of its candidates. Most everyone realizes that Mr. Nixon has serv
    ed as Vice President for the last eight years. In this capacity he has had a
    chance to become fa miliar with the operations and the intricacies of the
    most import ant job in the United States. Re gardless of Democratic attempts
    to underrate this experience, Mr. Nixon now presents to the Ameri can public
    a man more mature and qualified than Mr. Nixon of eight years ago. During
    this time he has had to assume the reins of government during President
    Eisenhower's sickness in Novem ber, 1957. He has represented the United
    States in an official capac ity in 54 foreign lands. Most re markable was
    his "kitchen de bate" with Khrushchev in Mos cow and his forebearance in the
    face of rioting crowds in Venezu ela. Mr. Nixon has shown his leadership

    questioned declined to comment on the situa tion and the comments of the
    Bucknellians will remain upon my ears alone. Truman had a net surplus of $4
    billion during the four years of peace while he was in office. Furthermore,
    when the Repub licans came to office in 1953, only 3% of the total labor
    force was unemployed, yet by December of 1954, unemployment was up 5% of the
    labor force. This unem ployment has hit those who are under 25, older
    workers, and negroes. In other words, we are the recipients of the slower
    labor demand which has resulted from the managing of our nation's fiscal
    policies by Republican "fis cal experts." Many of us going from college into
    the "big, wide world"* plan to live on our own incomes in stead of relying
    on Dad's affluent pocketbook for the rest of our lives. Yet, will Republican
    in flationary economic practices help us? No. During Eisenhower's eight
    years, rents have, increased on the average of 20%, gas and electric rates
    have gone'up 19%, solid fuel and fuel oils cost 16% more than they did
    before Eisen hower came in; residual water costs are 40% more, residential
    telephones cost 10% more, and household operations cost 23% more. And yet,
    the national econ omy fails to expand accordingly. (Continued on Page 10)

Content: 'M' * (Continued from Page 9) Democratic Platform What exactly do the Democrats
    propose, to do to alleviate these j conditions? Going to the Demo- ! cratic
    Platform for our answers, I we come up with the following plans: (1) We must
    end the tight ! money policy of the Republicans ! which has caused two
    recessions j and slowed down our economic : growth. The Democrats do not
    want to repeat' the Republican j addition of $9 million to our na- I tional
    debt, which, by the way, j was kept that low by a Demo- | cratic Congress
    which put a ceil- j ing on the interest rate of long- \ range government
    bonds. (2) The Democrats propose # through better applied monetary j credit
    policies, budget surpluses j in time of full employment and j action to
    restrain monopolistic! price-fixing to control inflation ! which has set in
    during the seven ! long Republican years. (3) In order to bring about full |
    employment, the Democrats pro- | pose public works, temporary tax cuts and
    the like to restore to work those 5 to 7.5% who have been unemployed during
    the past ! 30 months due to Republican poli- | cies of not caring if the
    little man j suffers so long as big business is I making a profit. (4)
    Through aid to depressed | areas, a program which has been twice passed by
    the Democratic Congress and twice vetoed by Eisenhower, the Demwrats will
    help areas which are economical ly depressed due to the extinction of
    natural resources, technical ad- | vances, and trade inbalances. (5) In
    order to give a living wage to those 8 million Ameri- j cans whose incomes
    are too low for them to provide food, cloth ing, and shelter for themselves,
    the Democrats propose a $1.25 minimum wage. ( 6 ) In order to aid consumers
    in sharing in the increasing pro ductivity of industries, the Demo crats
    intend to set up a consumer commission to speak with the government in
    policy-making ses sions. The Democrate party also intends to enforce the
    duties which the Republican administra tion has not demanded of the Food and
    Drug administrations. (7) The Democrats intend to show the American people w
    hat. fiscal responsibility is by allowing ' for normal economic growth so
    that we can meet our pdblic needs with a balanced budget and pres- | ent
    taxes with some surpluses. In I order to do this, the Democrats will end
    waste in Federal ex-1 penditures, collect the billions in taxes owed to the
    federal govern ment but not collected during the last several years,
    (Eisenhower*1, and the Republican Congress in 1953 cut the staff of the
    Internal Revenue until they are unable'to process an adequate number of
    cases), close loopholes in tax-laws to privileged groups (such as business
    expense account pad ding), and bring in more federal money by expanding the
    whole economy. The Democrats wM  I not hesitate to give needed dol- j lars
    for schooling and other na-j tional needs such as defense as f the
    Republicans have. How can we be sure that these I promises will be carried
    out? Let j us look for a moment at repre- I sentative samples of our two
    can- | didates' voting records in the Congress. In 1951, an amend- ment was
    introduced to reduce the allowances for gas and oil depletion. Nixon voted
    against this amendment. In 1958, Ken nedy voted for an amendment to reduce
    oil and gas depletion for taxpayers with oil and gas in comes over $1
    million a year. While both men were in the House, there were five opportuni
    ties for these two to vote on tax bills which would benefit those with
    incomes of over $300,000 and hurt the man on the street. Five times Nixon
    voted to 'help the upper income group and five times, Kennedy voted to help
    the man in the street. The record speaks for itself. What is good for
    General Motors is not, as the Republicans would have us believe, always good
    for the United States. Seven long Republican years have prov ed this.

    Based on the recommendations of high school teachers and coun sellors, 50
    high school juniors and seniors have been invited to par ticipate in the
    University's Su perior High School Student Pro grams in literature and mathe
    matics. Those enrolled in the literature program will read and discuss 15
    selected books in the fields of philosophy, science, re ligion, sociology
    and fiction dur ing the one-year course, while the twenty-five students
    admitted to the mathematics program will engage in studies designed to ac

    will meet with a member of the Bucknell faculty each Saturday morning
    through out the year to discuss the impli cations and significance of what
    they have heard and read during the preceding week. Dr. Edward Partridge,
    associate professor of English, will conduct the "litera ture classes, while

    1938 when Tustin Gym was remodeled for the ex clusive use of women students
    after the completion of Davis Gymnasium. The new wing, to be construct- I ed

Heading: Which Above All?
Content: Class Meetings? Freshmen Firesides? Synchronette Try-outs? Take your pick! This
    is one of the outstand ing advantages of the college campus. Where else but
    . in a university can one find so many opportunities for ex tra-curricular
    activities? Where else cap one so easily achieve that much desired status--
    that of 'the "well rounded"? , Yet it would seem, at least to those as naive
    as we, that something is basically wrong with this situation. Isn't there
    another side to college life--the academic one? Extra curricular activities
    are important. But some where the line must be drawn. Wednesday night the
    Bucknell Student Forum presented a program on Germ Warfare. The speaker,
    Marc G. Raskin was well qualified to discuss the topic. The date of the
    program had been registered since the beginning of the academic year. Yet in
    spite of this fact, other non-academic activities were planned that
    conflicted with the Forum Program. If the University is concerned enough
    about the success of its Homecoming Plans to close the week-end to other
    activities that might conflict with them, it would be thought that it would
    be equally concerned with the pre vention of conflicts with acdemic events.
    Or is it that the social side of life at Bucknell has become more im portant
    than the academic side? if<< '

Heading: Ann ces Competition
Content: Although the majority of students do not enter college with the expectation of
    making Dean's List, the import ance of grades is recognized by all. Grades
    are of imme diate concern to the student, for to remain in school he must
    maintain a certain average, and to participate in certain activities this
    average must be higher still. Stu dents with top grades are eligible for
    Dean's List and for various honorary organizations. In the more distant fu
    ture, the individual's grades and total average will have a profound effect
    on his career, and thus his entire life. No student, however, should choose
    his courses only in terms of the grades he may expect from them. Grades
    provide a fairly accurate measure of what an individual has gained from a
    course in relation to the standards of that course. But it is a well-known
    fact that some courses possess lower standards of achievement than others.
    By careful selection in May and December, it is quite simple to reg ister
    for the low-numbered course, the easy professor, the Q. C. course. In doing
    so, however, the student stands to lose much more than he gains. Difficult
    courses, challenging professors and honors sec tions offer rewards far more
    valuable than a high grade- point average. For one thing, material in such
    courses is presented in a searching and extensive manner, with a resulting
    gain in concrete knowledge. Mare important, however, is the intangible
    factor of the student's personal development. It is only through challenge,
    through asking more .of himself than he hs done before, that the
    individual's high est abilities may be realized. The student who is willing
    to measure himself against standards more fundamental than letter-grades
    will choose his courses on the basis of the challenge they offer him, and
    will in all probability discover that his abilities are equal to the
    challenge. Gee \yhiz! It's getting so an Honest mouse can't get a bite to
    eat. Once--long ago, I could creep into Womens' dining hall or Men's during
    the meal and grab a bite to eat. Now, everywhere I go, there's People. (Not
    that I have anything against people.) But It's hard to dodge a hundred or so
    feet Under those tables in the waitress's eating room. I mean, I don't mind
    Waiting for the waitresses to eat before I take my snack from the " garbage"
    (vile word) bin. But when I have to wait another 45 minutes While those
    "overflows" are eating-- Well, there's just about so much a self-respecting
    mouse can take. There's food everywhere And I don't dare let more than my
    nose peek Out of the hole in the wall for fear of being SQUISHED. Then, just
    as I hear them leaving Zounds--the waitresses come barrelling out of the
    kitchen. Then by the time all that confusion's over Nothing's warm anymore.
    And I wouldn't dare go to men's Between the trains and the lines of feet
    down to the tracks, I'd be sure to'get trampled. I guess my only recourse is
    to raid the CARE packages From home. Groooooowl--Pardon please--there goes
    my hungry stomach off to a rumbling start-- It's back to the cookie cans for
    me. Yours for bigger and better dining halls,

Heading: AS MEMORIES FOND COME TROOPING BY
Content: by Jane Tilton Lewisburg 1854 Dr. Howard Malcolm, president of the University at
    Lewisburg, has announced the official cost of a year's education in the
    newly published catalog. The tuition of $30 per year is quite reasonable,
    yet extras have made attendance at the school rather expensive. Ad ditional
    fees are as follows: room rent $7.50, library fee $2, and fuel for private
    rooms $3, making a total of $44.50. The students enrolled in the seminary
    are forced to pay considerably more. For the ladies a fee of $100 per year
    has been indicated to obtain board, fuel, and light. Other hidden charges
    have been known to reach $95.00. In spite of increased costs, which, in view
    of the rising costs to day in most areas, the University is still quite
    realistic in regard to the handling of student expenditures. The catalogs
    illustrate this sensible policy: "There s great hazard, in most cases, in
    allowing students to have in their possession any considerable sums of
    money, un less they have been accustomed to it at home. Some person in
    Lewisburg should be entrusted with the funds, expend it as re quired, and
    render exact accounts. Many a student has been ruined at college for want of
    this precaution." In keeping with this policy several of the faculty members
    have agreed to handle student funds for a fee of five per cent of money
    handled.

    in the techniques of inter collegiate debating. The topic selected for
    argumen tation this year is of timely inter est. A modified version of the
    issue has been passed in the last session of Congress. ' The debate topic
    is: "Resolved: that we should adopt a system of compulsory medical insurance
    for all citi zens." To date, the Society has receiv ed invitations to five

    of the 'Ivy Colleges" under the guid ance of Dr. Merritt and Mr. Hor-

Heading: PSYCHIATRIST COMES
Content: Once upon a time at the University of Virginia there was a coed named, oddly
    enough, Virginia University who was hand some and kindly and intelligent and
    ingeniously constructed and majoring in psychology. Virginia went steady
    with a young man on campus named, oddly enough, Oddly Enough who was supple
    and fair and lithe and animated and majoring in phys ed. Virginia and Oddly
    enjoyed a romance that was as idyllic as a summer day, as placid as a
    millpond. Never did they fight-- never, never, never!--because Virginia, who
    was majoring in psychology, did not believe in fighting. " Fighting,"  she
    often said, "settles nothing. The scientific way is to look calmly for the
    cause of the friction." So whenever she and Oddly were on the verge of a
    quarrel, she used to whip out a series of ink blot tests and they would
    discover the true underlying cause of their dispute and deal with it in an
    enlightened, dispassionate manner. Then, the irritant removed, their romance
    would resume its tranquil, serene, unruffled course.

    Serving as officers of the organ ization are: Dennis Rittenhouse, president;
    Linda Roth, vice presi dent; Kathryn McVicker, secre tary; and Betty Kordes,
    treasurer.1 After six months of this sedate liaison, Oddly was so bored he
    could spit. He loved Virginia well enough, but he also be lieved that people
    in love ought to fight now and then. " It opens the pores,"  he said. " And
    besides, it's so much fun mak ing up afterwards." But Virginia would not be
    provoked into a quarrel. One night Oddly tried very hard. " Hey,"  he said
    to her, "your nose looks like a banana, and your ears look like radar
    antenna, and your face looks like a pan of worms." " M y goodness, we're
    hostile tonight!"  said Virginia cheerfully and whipped 120 Rorschach cards
    out of her reticule. " Come," she said, " let us examine your psychic
    apparatus." Oddly tried again. " You're fat and dumb and disagreeable," he
    said, " and you'll be bald before you're thirty." " Hmm,"  said Virginia
    thoughtfully and lit a cigarette. " This sounds like an anxiety neurosis
    with totemism, anagogic trauma, and a belt in the back." I hate you,' said

    an exhibit of first editions from the collection of La Fayette Butler, will
    be on display on the first floor of Bertrand Library for several weeks. The
    selection of the material in the showcases was based on Merle Johnson's
    Highspots of American Literature, a book revealing the literary works that
    the author felt influenced the life, and, more important, the thoughts of
    hun dreds of thousands of Americans. Mr. Butler, an ex-professor of
    literature, has in his extensive private library in Hazelton, Penn sylvania,
    all but two of the 200 selections mentioned in the book. A large segment of
    Mr. Butler's sollection may be seen, including Ben Hur and a copy of Poe's
    Tales which originally cost thirty- one cents. Viewers might also be
    interested in some of the other books such as The Gentle Art of Making
    Enemies by James Whist ler and Burgess' Are You a Bro mide? The display also
    features original letters by the authors, and photographs of the actual set
    tings of their books. Following this display, one of I three planned and
    shown by Mr. Butler, the Pennsylvania Histori- cal Association and Bertrand
    Li- I brary will present a collection of | relics and documents from the i
    history of this state, including i maps, birth certificates and pho- \

Heading: I
Content: read with interest David Baird's remarks last week about Nix(r)n's experience
    which has ostensibly prepared him for the White House. The man who should
    best be able to tell us about Mr. Nixon's experience seems to think
    differently, how ever. In his press conference of Au gust 24, 1960, after
    insisting that he makes all decisions himself, Ike replied that he could not
    think of a single major idea given him by Nixon. If, however, we can accept
    Mr. Nixon's assertions that he has been very active in policy-making in the
    Eisenhower administration, what do we have to point to in the field of
    foreign policy to be proud of? Today, our foreign policy is un certain and
    vague. In 1954, Ike announced a policy of "jnassive retaliation" to help the
    French forces in Indo-China. However, he failed to meet his promise and Dien
    Bien fell to the Communists. In the 1952 presidential campaign, Ike pledged
    to encourage libera tion of countries behind the Iron Curtain. In October of
    1956, the Hungarian people rose up against their oppressors hoping that
    American support would come; it did not, and Hungary fell back into the
    Communist fold. by David Baird On July 27, 1960, the RepuB-

Content: lican National Convention adopt ed the Republican platform for the ensuing four
    years. It is a platform built around the recog- I nition of the Communist
    threat j and the need to maintain our na tion's economic growth in face of
    that threat. The United State's foreign policy and its economic growth, a
    discussion of which will follow next week, will probably be the two main
    issues in the Presidential campaign. With so many of the world's leaders par
    ticipating in the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations, it
    is only natural for the people of the United States to be come more
    conscious of our foreign policy. Foreign policy has be considered by Vice
    Presi dent Nixon and ex-ambassador Lodge as one of their major at tributes
    as candidates for office. At the same time it has been proper for the
    Democratic nom inees to be critical of the present foreign policy. Many
    people realize the import ance of foreign policy but not the exact position
    to which the United States has been elevated in world leadership. Not only
    are we the leading military power of the Western nations, but we are an
    important ideology leader. We must regard the United States I as having the
    job of appeasing I and aiding all the underdevelop ed nations, which have
    become cold war fronts, while matching Soviet efforts in this economic
    ideology war. But there is noth ing to keep Russia from concen trating its
    cold war efforts on a particular country, forcing the Untied States to
    belatedly match her efforts. Many times the United States has been
    criticized, for this reason, as not being ag gressive enough, but this is
    the only way to combat the sniping actions of the unorthodox and un
    predictable Russians. Russia also has a definite offen sive from an
    historical view. Free enterprise and democracy became accepted institutions
    before the Communist experiment was start ed in Russia in 1917. Russia is
    trying to introduce and persuade other countries to accept Com-- munism,
    whereas the United States has the problem of main taining faith in the
    democratic way of life. With many under developed areas emerging as na
    tions, this is often a difficult task. Many times these new nations do not
    consider their rate of econom ic progress under a democratic government as
    fast enough. Therefore, we find the Russians capitalizing on this fact while
    painting a glorious picture of (Continued on Page 10) by Gail Morreall

    television appearances with Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice President
    Richard Nixon is scheduled for Friday, October 7 at 7:30 p. m. Orig inating
    in Cleveland, the pro gram will forego debates, fea turing an hour of
    questions posed by a panel of news re porters. In 1956, our government offer
    ed to give economic and to help build the Aswan Dam. When we abruptly
    withdrew the offer, Nas ser, to regain his prestige, seized the Suez Canal
    and Communist penetration of the Middle East continues. In Cuba, we support
    ed Batista until a few days before Castro took over, encouraging the
    animosity of the Cuban govern ment which ousted the dictator Batista and
    .giving the Commun ists a head start in winning Cas tro's approval. During
    the past seven and a half years we have emphasized military aid to
    underdeveloped nations and decreased the eco nomic aid which they so desper
    ately need to feed and clothe their populations. In 1958, Mr. Nixon made his
    now famous trip to Latin America. Warned in ad vance that the natives were
    not i friendly, he insisted egotistically upon going and "standing up to the
    Commies." Again in May of 1960 the Eisenhower-Nixon team showed its superb
    knowledge of foreign affairs in the famous U-2 incident. Senator John F.
    Kennedy and the Democratic Party offer posi tive suggestions td help our
    coun try regain its position of great ness: continuous modernization of
    armed forces through intensified research and development, a com plete re-
    examination of the or ganization of our armed forces, and balanced
    conventional mili tary forces which will permit us to meet threats of
    aggression in the world. He further supports expanded aid programs to the un
    derdeveloped nation^. Furthermore, John F. Kennedy has the mature and
    intelligent approach so much needed in the negotiations w ith' the
    opposition powers. Instead of blowing up like a ten year old who hasn't
    gotten his lollypop, as Nixon did in his famous "kitchen debate" with
    Krushchev, Kennedy could be expected to maintain the same calm and assured
    manner which we all saw in the televised debate of October 26.

Content: When Wes Roberts was nearing the end of his senior year at San Jose State
    College, he was looking for a job with a wide open future. He found it when
    he joined Pacific Telephone in San Francisco. Here's how Wes tells it: " I
    remember one of my first jobs. The boss said, 'Wes, I want you to work out a
    plan showing where we'll need new field operating centers to keep up with
    Northern California's growth over the next 10 years.' I didn't know whether
    I was more happy or scared." Wes didn't tell us (but his boss did) that he
    handled the report like a pro. And today, as a division supervisor, he's
    holding down a key telephone job. Wes Roberts' story is not unique in the
    Bell Telephone Companies. The telephone business is growing fast--and men
    are needed who can grow just as fast. Wes can tell you: "W e get good

    wonderful trip"--"Ten days, old boat, but lots of fun." During the last day

    in the midst of Hurricane Donna, and Miss Reinel's first impression of an
    American metropolis was " a city without lights, without heat, and without

    and sororities. "Yes, there are fraternities, but many univer sities won't
    permit them." There are no sororities. Where fraterni ties are allowed, they
    serve the same purpose as do American ones: residence hall, dining room,

Heading: FROM THE SIDELINE
Content: by Sieve Skinner Several sophomore members of the football team have distin
    guished themselves on several occasions this year. Halfback Dick Johnson was
    named the outstanding sophomore in the Gettysburg game, and last weekend
    Dick Tyrrell snared six of " Turk" Terhes 14 passes. His effort must have
    aroused memories of the indomitable Terhes to Eachus combination of a year
    ago. Center Dean Stump has also received the praise of his fellow teammates
    as well as the football fans. The Bison-Comell game bore an odd resemblance
    to the Buck- nell-Harvard contest last year. There was a considerable
    distance between schools. Both times the Bisons traveled as slight
    underdogs, according to the experts. Each time Bucknell returned they
    brought with them the stigma of a defeat that never should have been. Na
    turally everyone feels that they "should have won," so you can not blame
    anybody for going back over each "If" . Last year's team did pull off two of
    the biggest upsets in small college football. This year they had several
    opportunities to pull an "upset" over an "emaci ated" Cornell team, even
    though that squad stretched from one 20 to the other. And so on speculation,
    ad infiinitum. Every week it is my pleasure to open the mail addressed to
    the sports editor. Never having any mail to open before, this process
    requires some ceremony. Two interesting letters were sent my way this week.
    One dealt stren uously with the plight of the Rutgers cross country coach
    who finds himself mentor of a team of six runners, five of whom must finish
    if Rutgers is to maintain its athletic reputation. The coach of the team has
    never had a los ing track season. Good Luck. The University of Massachu
    setts Collegian sent a question naire this school's way concern ing athletic
    scholarships. They inquired about Buckley's scholar ship sports, our
    football record over the past five years, whether or not football is our
    major sport, and if we had any plans to build Bucknell up to be one of the
    ma jor powers in the East. What results they expect to obtain ap parently
    are in connection with some incident that occurred at Massachusetts over
    scholarships. They're taking a nationwide poll and we'll publish the results
    as fast as we get them. Bucknell seems to be heading along the same Bison
    trail of in juries, which plagued last year's squad. Tackle Denny Morgan is
    hurt and so is Bill Urch. At first report Morgan was to have been out 2-4
    weeks, but the latest hear say is that he'll be ready for the Rutgers game.
    Urch, Morgan, and Don Chaump, all fraternity brothers, will have the unwel
    come duty of keeping each other company on the beach tomorrow when Buffalo
    comes to town. The team got' a look at Buffalo when they watched Army
    vanquish the upstate New York team 37-0 on film.- Athletic Director A1
    Humphreys has announced that the student tickets for Bucknell's game with
    Rutgers, the weekend of the fif teenth, will be on sale for half price,
    $1.50. If you wait until you get to New Brunswick, you'll pay three'bills to
    see the Bisons play. There is one stipulation. When you buy your ticket you
    have to sign to get it at half price. No blocks of tickets will be sold.

Content: by Joe Ciffolillo A strong line and a couple of hard running backs enabled Cor
    nell University to win its first game of the young campaign, 15 to 7. A
    crowd of about 10,000 people were on hand at Schoellkopf Field Saturday
    afternoon to see the Big Red pound out 265 yards rushing as cojnpared to
    only 80 yards rushing for the Bisons. Al though the bigger Red line out
    played the Bison front wall, there were times when Bucknell really looked
    good. One of the brighter points came in the third quarter when Cornell's
    halfback Pat Pennucci carried the ball in side the Bucknell six-yard line
    for a first down. The determined Bison line dug in and held, tak ing the
    ball after four Cornell tries which all proved unsuccess ful. The Bucknell
    line also look ed good as they gave quarterback Paul Terhes plenty of time
    to let loose a total of 29 passes of which 14 were completed for a total of
    130 yards. Bucknell managed to draw first blood after five and one half min
    utes had gone by in the second quarter. Terhes led the Bisons on a 44-yard
    march in nine plays, and finally drove over himself i unable to move in the
    first three from the two-yard line giving plays from scrimmage. Then John
    Bucknell a brief edge. The drive Beeby, a 160 pound fullback from started

    Bison line worked the ball up to the two-1 held in their goal line stand,
    quarterback Rick Elliott punted from the end zone to the Bucknell 35 yard
    line. On the first play, right halfback Ken Kavensky sliced off left tackle
    with a nice fake, cut to the right, and raced 35. yards for the touchdown.
    Telesh's kick was good and Cor nell led 15 to 7. Bisons Threaten The Bisons
    threatened again in the final quarter when they pick ed up four first downs
    on what appeared as though it might be another touchdown march for BU.
    Terhes completed five passes in this drive only to see his last screen pass
    to Micky Melberger fall short of a first down by less than one yard on the
    Cornell 27. Bucknell again came close to (Continued on Page 9) yard line
    when Terhes finally bucked over. Ron Maslanik's place kick was good making
    the score 7-0. Big Red Retaliate It took Cornell only five min utes to reach
    paydirt. The Big Red took the kickoff and traveled 68 yards in 15 plays.
    George Telesh returned the kickoff to his own 30-yard line when he was
    finally brought down by Dick Johnson. After a good series of running and
    passing by Cornell's- halfback Pat Pennucci, and the help of a 15-yard
    holding penalty, Cornell had the ball first and ten on the Bucknell 15.
    Pennucci again carried to the Bucknell five- yard line for another first

    unfortunately have seemed to acquire the knack of doing just that. Along
    with Don Chaump, who is lost for the season, Bill Urch and Denny Mor gan
    have joined the disabled list. Urch is a fullback and saw a lot of action in
    the first two games. Morgan, a starter at tackle, will really put a dent in
    the Bucknell line. The last time a UB squad faced a ten-game schedule was in
    1916 when the Bulls posted a 3-5-2 rec ord. The 1960 Bulls face ten
    straight, weeks of the toughest grid schedule in Blue and White history.

    (three times--twice in one season), Colgate, Columbia and Penn State. Said

    Both experienced and dependable. The Package The Package: If the offensive
    and defensive patterns are to click in the typical Offenhamer tradi tion,
    there is plenty of work to be done in the 14 days of double session drills.
    Starting Septem ber 1st, there was concentration on the interior line
    assignments. Sophomores, especially at tackle, have had to exceed any
    previous efforts. The Bulls will again go with their quick-change tactics,
    utilizing the explosive punch and defensive rigidity that led to 8-1-0
    records during the past two sea sons. UB sports one of the most polished QB
    trios in the East, and perhaps the nation. Their calls will assign the
    untested linemen and fast, experienced backs to capitalize on the opponents'
    weak nesses or mis-cues. Messrs. B, G, & O know the capabilities of their
    team mates and are proven masters of defense analysis. Some last minute
    position changes were made by Coach Odell as a result of the injuries
    incurred in last week's game with Cornell. Ashton Ditka, who was named
    "Chuckles Ax-Murder" by the Quarterback Club of Lewis- burg for his play at
    Cornell, will play first string halfback and second string fullback. Tom
    Note- ware will fill in for Denny Mor gan at the tackle spot. Other changes
    will be announced at game time. Alcohol and gasoline do not mix on the

    was asked a few weeks ago to Bucknell students by Lt. Richard Grabow of the
    ROTC Dept. The response to the question was so great that it resulted in a
    new Bucknell Club which promises to be the hottest thing on campus. The
    Parachute Club consists of 25 students with Lt. Grabow as the faculty advsor
    and Alan Gardner as the first president. The objective of the club is tq
    conduct parachuting activities on weekends, and to select a team to compete
    in the Spring intercol legiate parachuting matches to be held against
    Cornell, Princeton, West Point, Dartmouth, and U. of Massachusetts. Sport
    parachuting or "sky-diving" as it is common ly called, is a sport in which
    the participant dives out of an air plane at a high'altitude, stabilizes and
    manages himself while he is falling free, and then after a period of time
    opens his para chute and steers it towards a ground target. The club members
    will first jump with static lines which will automatically open their para
    chutes after 3 seconds. Then they will progress gradually up to de layed
    free-falls of 30 seconds.

    Coupes, for example, head room has been upped as much as 2 inches, and
    there's more leg room, too--front and rear). Chevy's new trunk is something

Content: by Pete Cowman In their first loss of the 1960 season, the Bucknell soccer team
    suffered a 5-0 defeat last Satur day afternoon at the hands of the Owls from
    Temple. Getting off to a slow start, Bucknell found itself behind by 3
    tallies by the end of the first period. Temple's superior forward line out-
    classed the Bisons during the first 22 min- utej of conflict. As the second
    session began, the booters from Bucknell seemed to pick up on their
    defensive play. Tightening their defense a good bit, the Bisons managed to
    hold Temple's All-American line to one goal. The Bucknell line had few op
    portunities to score in Temple's home territory; however, they did manage to
    get several shots off from the wings. The second half brought im provement
    in Bucknell's play. ] Our booters were on the offensive much more than in
    the first half. I Creating several opportunities for I good shots at the
    visitor's goal, the Bisons were thwarted only by j | the outstanding play of
    the j i Temple goalie. Play was sparked during <<the j | third period by the
    fine defensive j j play of Bucknell fullback, Cap j | Weil, and of goalie,
    Howie Levine,! j Inspired play on the part of these j | men especially, held
    the Owls to i ' their only scoreless quarter. The fourth stage of the
    contest I i was similar to the third. Play I | by both teams was hard and
    fast, j The Owls did manage to boot one I more goal during the final min- j

Heading: Forum Presentation
Content: 

Heading: Not SpeclRx Enough
Content: Several questions remain in the minds of those who attended the opening meeting
    of the Bucknell Student Forum, Wednesday eve ning, at which time Marc G. Ras
    kin discussed Germ Warfare. Mr. Raskin, legislative assistant to several
    United States Congress men, is well qualified to discuss the subject, but
    unfortunately did not present what many Bucknell- ians had expected to hear.
    Mr. Raskin opened his discus sion !by considering the historical background
    of germ warfare in the United States. A proclama tion was made by President
    Roosevelt in 1943 which stated that 'under no circumstances would the United
    States use poisonous gas first, but that we would reply in kind if other
    powers made the first move. A  major question under consid eration in
    Congress, and' one which we should consider indi vidually, is: Should we at
    this time reaffirm Pres. Roosevelt's proclamation? Unfortunately, the
    audience was not given sufficient informa tion to formulate an answer to the
    question. The speaker discussed a group which he called "our second class
    citizens of defense," the Chemical Corporation. Very little was ac tually
    revealed except that this group is responsible for basic re search and
    development. Many problems accompany the use of chemical and biological
    weapons. Control is very difficult and "chances for inspection are almost
    nil." Production of the materials in question does not re quire extreme
    skill. "Germs can be made in anyone's basement." Another serious threat is
    "Gun runner" organizations that sell the dangerous commodities to { small
    countries. Raskin raised ? another question: If other coun- I tries have
    access to these means, i should we tie our hands and make statements
    limiting ourselves to | certain types of "brutalization?" If the Soviet is
    developing germ warfare, shouldn't we? Public reaction is of utmost
    importance in considering a sub- i ject so vital to national security.!
    People have a moral repulsion to the idea of mass annihilation ! by chemical
    means. The Chemi- cal Corporation wants "to lift the veil of secrecy" and
    overcome the I misconceptions that exist. In the Twentieth century, too
    often there is little interest in | government; and debates of such [
    controversial subjects rage mainly I in the "crowded goldfish bowl" of
    Washington. Mr. Raskin presented his talk in an almost too casual manner !
    for Vaughan Literature Auditor- j ium. His presentation would have been more
    effective if given in a smaller room; a discussion group | would also have
    added to its im pact. Most students anticipated more specific information
    and therefore, were disappointed. In all fairness to Mr. Raskin, may I add
    that he was in a diffi cult position. He was attempting to provide
    background for a dis cussion and present that discus sion at the same time.
    This was too great a task for the time altot- ed.

    Mme. Rosina Lhevinne. j Van played first in public at the age of four,
    performing Bach's C-Major Prelude at Shreveport's Dodd College. By the time
    he was six, it was obvious to all that Van was destined for - a concert
    career, and, after the family's move to Kilgore, his father had a studio
    built for. him on the back of the garage, where the boy practiced faithfully
    before going to school, and again after school, and after dinner. Van Clibum
    was to win many accolades and prizes before his history-making journey to
    Mos cow. At the age of 12, as win ner of a state-wide young pian ist's
    competition, he made his or chestral debut with the Houston Symphony,
    playing Tchaikow- sky's B Flat Concerto, the same piece which was to bowl
    the Russians over in 1958. The fol lowing year, in 1959, he made his
    Carnegie Hall debut as winner of the National Music Festival Award. By then
    he had already reached his six-foot-four height. Scholarship to Juilliard
    Upon his graduation from high school in~ Kilgore in 1951, Van at last

    the Bucknell campus. Mr. Ball will speak at 2 p. m. on Sunday, Oc tober 16
    in room 101B, Coleman Hall. His topic will be: May an American be President?
    He will talk about the election from the point of view of a Catholic Con
    stitutional lawyer and will also discuss why he thinks the public image of
    the Catholic Church has not appeared as it might to many non-Catholics. Mr.
    Ball, who writes for a num ber of journals and is particularly interested in
    the field of Church- State relations, is a member of the Pennsylvania, New

Content: At the Nine-Thirty Class on Sunday, Sheila Taynton of Leb anon Valley College
    will report on her experience with Russian students last summer as part of a
    special leadership project in Rus sia. This will be the fourth report on the
    thinking and concerns of students in bther countries, given in the. Nine-
    thirty class this se mester. Last Sunday, Bashir Kassis of Algeria presented
    the Algerian student point of view. Giving the background of French control
    in North Africa, he traced the freedom attempts of the Algerian people,
    their participation in two wars for democracy, and their de sire to govern
    themselves. He placed the responsibility for opposition to freedom, not on
    the French people, but on the "colons," the million or more French citizens
    who have been the developers and exploiters of the resources of Algeria.
    Inde pendence, Mr. Kassis says, is in evitable, and should be achieved
    without further loss of life and bitterness, and without necessita ting the
    direct intervention of other foreign powers.

Heading: What Price Principle?
Content: On Friday night, October 7, the underlying principle of American Democracy was
    denied by a man who is a can didate for the office of President of the
    United States. In the second of a series of televised debates Richard Nixon,
    Vice-President of the United States, denied the principle upon which America
    is built. The Vice-President was discussing the question of the defense of
    the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. In his dis cussion he pointed out that,
    "the real-estate is unimport ant, it isn't the few people who live on them,
    they are not too important. It's the principle involved." What principle was
    the Vice-President referring to? One is hard pressed to think of any
    principle which super1 cedes the welfare of human beings. The dignity of the
    individual is what is upheld in a democracy. Yet the Vice-President doesn't
    think that the people on Quemoy and Matsu are worth our concern. The
    Bucknellian does not wish to be identified with either of the major parties.
    However, Mr. Nixan's statement is equally offensive to Republicans and
    Democrats alike. One of the problems with which the viewer of the de bate
    was confronted was trying to decide which of the candidates was telling the
    truth. On several occasions there were direct contradictions in the
    statements made by the two men. One can only conclude that one of the
    individuals, Mr. Kennedy or Mr. Nixon was presenting a distorted image of
    the truth. An interesting aspect was Mr. Nixon's appeal to the voters to
    forget party labels and vote for the man. We think that it is a little
    difficult to do so. The national conventions drafted platforms for their
    respective candidates to run upon. We don't think it is possible to do such
    a thing. The candidate and his party are inseparable in their aims and
    methods. Lest we be accused of favoritism let us turn the spot light to
    Senator Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy's glaring fault was his refusal to address the
    civil rights question direct ly. He was speaking after Vice-President Nixon
    had re sponded to. a question inquiring about his civil rights pro grams.
    Mr. Nixon gave no program but simply stated those issues he felt to be
    important. This was an excel lent opportunity for Senator Kennedy to give
    some con crete answers concerning his program. However, all he did was state
    a different set of jssues. There can be little doubt that both men are
    trying very hard to keep the southern voter from alienation. Nevertheless
    what is po litically expedient is not always morally right. A man who
    aspires to the office of President of these United States should not be
    afraid to speak out for equality and the democratic principles for which so
    many have died. It is indeed a disgrace when seventy-five percent of the
    country is subjugated to twenty-five percent as in the case of the civil
    rights questions. Both men should feel asham ed of themselves for their ack
    of courage. The televised sessions are probably one of the most publicly
    beneficial devices to come out of the political camps in many years. The
    people have a chance to see the candidates under fire, and in this way see
    them in a much clearer light than is given off from a prepared speech. We
    see the debates as a good thing, our only re gret is what we have seen and
    heard from both men. Let us all take ourselves a little more seriously and
    perhaps create men who are not afraid.

    blankets when they're all skrunched up at the end of the beds.) And how
    about my cultural development? Why, all weekend you Bucknellians were out

    to you That the books you leave aren't worth reading--that's work! But I
    must say, the food was much improved-- for, this I do thank you parents.
    (It's strange how the menus suddenly include steak one weekend a year) 1 And

Heading: Plans for WVBU
Content: Station manager Ken Rein- heimer has announced some of the various plans which
    WVBU, Bucknell's radio station has for the coming year. Presently, WVBU is
    on the air daily from 7 p. m. to 1 a. m. and from 2 p. m. to 1 a. m. on
    Sunday. However, the station hopes to'expand its now diverse program and
    broad cast in the afternoon. This year, WVBU has added new features to its
    extensive pro gram. Every hour from 8 p. m. to 12 p. m. there is a 5-minute
    news summary. The news head lines are broadcast on the half hour. WVBU
    receives its news information from United Press International teletype.
    Included in WVBU's future plans are broadcasting the away basketball games
    and sponsoring the 640 Club. This club will pro vide music for a record hop
    in the Bison on either Friday or Saturday nights. More detailed information
    will be released at a later date. WVBU is located in the basement of the
    Carnegie Building. Until a permanent ad visor is selected, Dean Hayward is
    acting advisor for the group. The WVBU staff consists of the following: Ken
    Reinheimer, sta tion manager; Bob Bentivenga, business manager; Bill
    Fletemeyr, program director; A1 Hartley, chief engineer; George Klingler,
    music director; Larry Hamilton, advertising director; Paula Grif- fen,
    publicity director; Gail Trul- linger, news director; Bill Brels- ford,
    technical director; Marge McGroarty, secretary; and Tom Darrah, membership
    chairman.

Heading: Quality and Quantity
Content: The concept of a university is one of research and schol arly insight.
    Unfortunately most undergraduates are not equipped to supply either, of
    these commodities to the university scene. It is far this reason that we
    feel that Bucknell should make a greater effort to expand her grad uate
    program. Granted that a fine graduate program does exist, however, it could
    always be a little better. The re cent Dual Development Fund Drive did not
    list increased research facilities as one of its objectives. We feel that
    this was an error. At the present time there are only five fellowships open
    to graduate students who are not grad uates of Bucknell. Certainly new
    buildings are important, but there can be no substitute for bringing more
    minds to bear on the present problems facing the American Society. While the
    undergraduate is the base of the university, the grad uate student is the
    tower which enables the school to stretch upwards. Unfortunately many
    graduate students at Bucknell find themselves in classes with undergrad
    uates. This is unfair to one or the other depending on how the class is
    conducted. We feel that Bucknell should and can put forth a greater effort
    to increase the qualify and quantity of her graduate program. October 5,
    1960 I To the students of English 103:

Content: All right, so some of you are | taking this course only because it is required;
    so the public address system leaves much to be desired; so you think
    Odysseus and his wanderings are! idle fairy tales: this is no excuse for the
    brazen rudeness that allows a professor of this university to stand before a
    filled lecture hall for several minutes before he can make him self heard
    above the din; it is no excuse for notebooks slamming shut and arm rests
    being noisily lowered as soon as the bell rings, drowning the lecturer's
    words in the rising clatter. We are all guilty of this dis gusting display
    of disrespect. We could well learn, from the Greeks we spurn, the lesson of

    overheard questioning the simplest mechanical features of our government,
    many of which actually affect our daily lives. This bewilderment is not a
    result of disagreement; it is a result of ignorance. The committee,
    empowered to formulate the governing regula tions, prepared a clear, concise
    set of rules. The majority of women have not done their share. Their
    puzzlement stems from laziness. Everything is stated in the hand book in
    black and white. If you find some "gray," Senate will gladly clarify your
    thinking. The general rules as well as the structural set-up are clearly
    defined. Most of the misconcep tions and unnecessary questions are due to
    the fact that so many women have not read the govern ing regulations even
    once! It's up to you, and only you. The success of any governing sys tem
    requires that those people living under it familiarize them selves with its
    principles and structure before the government can operate effectively and
    effi ciently. WSGA Senate

Heading: "HOME SWEET HOMECOMING"
Content: A great number of people have been asking me lately, "What is Homecoming?" but I
    have been so busy trying to find out why my new sports car leaks that I
    haven't had time to answer. I am now pleased to report that I finally
    discovered why my sports car leaks--I have been driving it upside down--and
    so I am ready today to turn my attention to Homecoming. Let's begin with
    definitions. Homecoming is a weekend when old grads return to their alma
    maters to watch a football game, visit old classrooms and dormitories and
    inspect each other's bald spots. The weekend is marked by the singing of old
    songs, the slap ping of old backs and the frequent exchange of such
    greetings as " Harry, you old polecat!" or " Harry, you old porcupine!" or
    "Harry, you old rooster!" or " Harry, you old wombat!" As you can see, all
    old grads are named Harry. It is not just old grads who behave with such
    liveliness during Homecoming; the faculty also comports itself with unaccus
    tomed animation. Teachers laugh and smile and pound backs and keep shouting
    " Harry,you old Airedale!" This unscholarly behavior is carried on in the
    hope that old grads, in a transport of bonhomie will endow a new geology
    building. The old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time on
    Saturday their backs are so sore, their eyeballs so eroded, their
    extremities so frayed, that it is impossible to get a kind word out of them,
    much less a new geology building.

Content: Even the football game does not improve their tempers. " Hmmph!" they snort as
    the home team completes a 101-yard march to a touchdown. " Do you call that
    football? Why, back in my day, they'd have been over pn the first down! By
    George, football was football in those days--not this namby- pamby girls!
    game that passes for football today! Take a look at that bench--50
    substitutes sitting there. Why, in my day, there were 11 men on a team and
    that was it. When you broke a leg, they slapped a piece of tape on it and
    you went right back in. Why, I remember the big game against State. Harry
    Siga- foos, our star quarterback, was killed in the third quarter. 1 mean,
    he was pronounced dead. But did that stop old Harry? Not on your tintype!
    Back in he went and kicked the winning drop kick in the last four seconds of
    play, dead as he was. Back in my day, they played football, by George!"
    Everything, say the old grads, was better back in their day-- everything
    except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the old grads has to admit that
    back in his day they never had a smoke like Marlboro--never a cigarette with
    such a lot to like --never a filter so easy drawing, a flavor so mild yet
    hearty, so abundant, so bountiful--never a choice of flip-top box or soft
    pack. So old grads, young grads, and undergrads, why don't you settle back
    and have a full-flavored smoke? Try Marlboro, the filtered cigarette with
    the unfiltered taste, and Homecoming will be a happy occasion and the sun
    will shine and the air will be filled with the murmur of wings pnd no man's
    hand will be raised against you. (c) 1960 Max Shulmaa * He * At Homecoming

Content: by Frank Wood With the constant reports of turmoil in Africa drumming in j our
    ears, we too often lose sight j of the positive efforts that are being done
    in Africa. Work that is being done by students just like us and through aid
    given by many Bucknellians last year. Last year and again this year j the
    emphasis o f the World Uni versity Service is on Community Development in
    Africa. These Community Development projects are designed not only to meet
    the needs of the particular villages, but also to meet the needs of |
    Africa's increasing number of university students. WUS has reported and I
    found out this summer that the African univer sity student states as his
    chief concern his relative isolation from his colleagues in other countries
    and from his own village. There fore, recognizing this need, WUS with a
    generous offer from Ford Foundation conducted a seminar in 1959 to study
    techniques and sponsor Community Development work camps in Sierra Leone and
    Ghana. Tw ofold Purpose The purpose of Community De velopment projects is
    twofold. First, materially it is designed to encourage the villagers to im
    prove their own community by improving their facilities, like water supply,
    building schools and houses by their Own labor and initiative. Secondly, but
    more important is to bring Afri can students from all parts of Africa
    together; to bring students into contact with the villagers, their customs
    and traditions; to bring non-Africans into contact with African students and
    villag ers; and to provide experience and training in community de velopment
    and self help tech niques. It is important to the new African nations that
    the students have a sense of responsibility to ward their villages and
    maintain their pride in their African tra dition and culture. A gap'must. be
    prevented from developing between the educated Africans ana the villagers.
    The young educated Africans, who have been in contact with modern technol
    ogy and health care, are better able than an outsider to get the villagers
    to make use of modern advances beneficial to him and his village. The
    villager, while working hand and hand with the students in a muddy ditch,
    can j not feel that the educated African I looks down upon him and his cul
    ture. Work Project I, too, this summer was work ing hand and hand in a muddy
    I ditch with young African students and the villagers. Near the end of the
    summer we drove 35 miles I through the Ashanti rain forest | of Ghana to
    another small village, ! Rgogo. There we took part in I the welcoming
    ceremony by the chief and all the villagers for 29 | Ghanaian students who
    were go- i ing to work together with the i villagers on a hostel structure
    which would house relatives of I patients in the Basel Mission Hos- j pital.
    This project was an out- i growth of the WUS seminar and I partly financed
    by the many ! Bucknellians who contributed last year. Because I had worked
    all sum mer on similar type projects, the students asked me many ques tions.
    How do you think the vil lagers will accept us? Would there be any
    resentment, toward us as students from outside? Would the villagers be eager
    to join in work with us? That day there was a gap between the stu dents and
    the villagers. But by the, village contact the students would not grow to
    feel ashamed of the tribal ceremonies and their tradition, and they could
    show the people the place they now have and the one they must strive tor in
    the 20th Century. Only by continued contact be tween the villagers and the

    Award and Russian Tschaikovsky Competition. The performance was one of the
    most exciting ever presented on this campus. Mr. Clibum surprised the audi
    ence at >the onset with a pianisti- cally-styled rendition of the Star
    Spangled Banner. Many felt that this competition was out of place, not
    worthy of the artist. It re flects, however, the young pian ist's great love
    and respect for this country, unusual in these hard-bitten modem times.
    Three Sonatas The first section of the regular program was Franz Liszt's Son
    ata in B minor, played in observ ance of the 150th Anniversary of the
    composer's birth. This partic ular sonata is regarded as the acme of Liszt's
    piano music, and as Mr. Cliburn said, the height of i Romantic writing. It
    is a long I involved work which uses a trans- I formation theme for unity
    instead of the usual sonata pattern of key centers, thematic development,
    and logical sectionings. The ex treme contrasts of the various parts--from
    the grandiose to the softest pianissimo, percussive to I beautiful melodic
    lines--were | fully realized by the performer, j Especially beautiful were
    the | sonorous effects. Most people are aware of Mr. Cliburn's power and
    strength because of his well- known Tchaikovsky Concerto. And in the Liszt
    the audience, for the most part, was astonished at the masterful control of
    the ar tist, as shown in the pianissimo flat minor completed the program.
    This composition was probably the most difficult to play, tech nically-
    speaking. It is full of complex rhythm patterns and very involved fast-
    moving pas sages, a romantic work with a great range of musical effects.

    after his team had shellacked a favored Buffalo squad by the score above.
    Surrounded by a group of well-wishers in the locker room after the contest,
    it was obvious that Odell was filled with the pride anjl feelig that only a
    coach roan know. When questioned about the reasons for his team's explosive
    play in the second half, he replied with, " I felt we could hurt Buffalo by
    moving the ball outside. We had a great deal of success outside, which threw
    the Buffalo defense off when we started to run inside. Td say the outside
    running was the key to our victory." Odell also said, "We Teally needed that
    victory." "After the show at Cornell last weekend, this game gave all Jhe
    boys a chance to play and re store confidende to the team in general." When
    queried about the outstanding defensive play by the Bisons, which caused
    three fumbles and a blocked punt, a typical Odell answer was given. "We'll
    take them." * * * * The coach was obviously pleased with the play of several
    of the "lesser lights" on his squad. To every one who offered congratula

    direction, for a touchdown. It. must have gone 40 yards;" Rick Elliot,
    senior quarterback, had just finished playing the finest game of his college
    career, which up till now had been some what eclipsed by Paul Terhes, who
    also had a field day. Turk was not the whole show last Saturday as has been
    the case several times in the past. It was rather a total team victory with
    the third string as fired up and inspired as the first. It was a real
    tribute to Bob Odell's patient rebuilding process. A . measure of Odell's
    ability as a coach is found on a sign that is the last thing the players see
    before they go onto the field. It states simply and profoundly one thing,

    Nothing to it. * * * * The offtcicils weren't exactly top drawer the whole
    time last weekend. On one play Bucknell really crossed themselves up and
    everyone went whichway before the ball was snapped. Turk faded back to pass,
    hut everyone was so confused, including Buffalo, that they just stood
    around. Finally a Buffalo lineman charged Terhes. At the same time an
    official blew his whistle, signifying that play had stopped. The lineman
    kept on charging and Turk put the stands into hysterics by !holding off the
    aggressor by grabbing a hold of his face guard and leading Him around like a
    bull with a ring in his nose. The ref had no prerogative to stop the play as
    Buffalo could have de clined the ensuing illegal procedure penalty and
    thrown Bucknell for a real loss. * * * * Tom Nptewure prilled a little
    slight of hand when he stole a fumble from a Bull lineman. From the
    sidelines it was obvious the Buffalo player got to the ball first, but when
    the smoke cleared the Bisons were on another touchdown drive. In the fourth
    quarter when Odell cleared the bench, second year man Doug Williams was
    (called upon to direct the Bisons up the field. On his second play from
    scrimmage he bobbled the ball as sopho mores will, but on the next down he
    played the part of a pro when he lofted a flat pass to Marty Pope good for
    25 yards. At the other end of the field soph Williams discovered that he had
    engineered the longest scoring drive by the Bisons this season, 92 yards.
    He's the only quarterback returning next year.

Heading: Defeated, 4-1
Content: Hank Peters' varsity soccer team was defeated by a hustling Navy team 4-1 on the
    victor's field last Saturday. The game was by no ?neans an easy win for the
    Midshipmen. Navy opened the scoring early in the first quarter on a looping
    35 yard shot by their inside left. The ball slipped between the crossbars
    and the outstretched arms of injured goalie Howie Levine. Navy kept the
    pressure on, and five minutes later they scored when a mixup occured in the
    Bison backfield. After Navy's second goal, Steve Conger replaced Howie
    Levine in the goal because the latter had trouble moving with his injured
    back. With Conger moving very well in the goal and the backfield oriented to
    their assignments, the Bisons withstood all of Navy's attacks for the
    remainder of the first quarter and throughout the second quarter. Bucknell's
    for ward line missed several scoring opportunities in the second quar ter
    which would have knotted the score. The third quarter was a see saw battle
    which saw both teams miss scoring opportunities. In the fourth quarter Navy
    scored twice on the only two good shots they had all afternoon. With the
    score 4-0 and with only a little over one minute left, Lyman Ott !took a
    beautiful lead pass from | Bob Schad, eluded the two men covering him, and
    caught the far I comer for the Bisons only score 1 of the game.

Heading: BUCKNELL HUMILIATES BUFFAL041-0
Content: by John Minsker Putting on a sensational second half exhibition, the Bucknell
    footballers made Parents' Day a glorious one by trampling the University of
    Buffalo by the score of 41-0 before 8,000 jubiliant on lookers at Memorial
    Stadium on Saturday. The partisan Bison crowd could not believe their eyes
    as their chargers streaked to five quick touchdowns in the second stanza at
    the expense of the pre-game favorites from New York. The second half
    exploison was quite spectacular as the score at half time was only 7-0,
    Bucknell hav ing scored in the closing minutes. A roll out pass from Turk
    Terhes to Dick Tyrrell, covering 17 yards, produced the first score. Ron
    Maslanik's point after touch down was perfect. The six-point er climaxed a
    drive of 67 yards, in which pitching Turk completed three passes for long
    gainers and Ash Ditka turned in sortie heavy groundwork. The first half saw
    the ball change hands 10 times, as neither team could sustain a drive. Joe
    Oliverio, quarterback for the Buffalo Bulls, led his team to the BU nine
    yard line with a series of screen passes early in the first quarter, but
    that was as far as they could go. In fact, that was the closest the Bulls
    came to pay dirt all afternoon. Tom Alexan der and Dick Johnson made nu
    merous key tackles for the Orange and blue in the defense-dominant first
    half. The last half was a completely different story as the BU eleven took
    advantage of mistake after mistake by the visitors while rolling up three
    TD's in the third stanza and two in the finale. After kicking off to start
    the third period, the Bisons, in the person of Tom Alexander, recov ered a
    Buffalo fumble on the 50 yard line. Captain Mickey Mel- berger, ran 23
    yards, and after an incomplete pass and an eight yard jaunt by Ash Ditka,
    Terhes skirt ed right end on an option play and went into the end zone stand
    ing up. The Bisons led 14-0. Not to be outdone by his run ning mate at
    quarterback, Rick Elliot led Bucknell to its second TD of the quarter.
    Elliot set up the touchdown by running the right side--just as Terhes had
    done--for 28 yards to the one yard line. Two plays later he I sneaked over
    from the three. Earlier, Tom Noteware set up the , drive by recovering a
    fumble on j the Bulls 32 yard line. Less than three minutes elapsed before
    the Bucks hit the scoreboard again. Dick Lebec fell on a visitor I fumble 15
    yards from the goal I stripe. ' BU was penalized back to the 32 before they
    started roll ing. On the second play from | that point, Elliott, still
    piloting his team, threw a perfect aerial to Dick Johnson in the end zone
    for the tally. The score at the end of the third period was 28-0. The final
    period was equally enjoyable for BU rooters as the third quarter was. Ron
    Maslanik started the ball rolling by block ing an Oliverio punt on the New
    Yorker's 26 yard stripe. Ken Twiford bulled for a single yard and two plays
    later he slipped through the opponents defense on a draw play for 16 yards
    and a score. Faking a kick, Terhes went for a two-pointer after the touch
    down, by throwing a pass to Twi ford, who made a spectacular div ing catch
    in the end zone. An off-sides penalty nullified this play but Maslanik
    promptly boot ed the PAT from five yards far ther back. Doug Williams, third
    Bison quarterback of the day, continued the scoring parade by engineer ing a
    drive totalling 92 yards. Starting on his own eight, the sophomore signal-
    caller led his troops through 12 quick plays climaxed by an eight yard toss
    to Marty Pope for the final six- pointer of the day. Looking like a veteran,
    Williams ran for 12 yards and completed three oout of three passes for 58
    more. Pope hauled in two of the aerials, in cluding the scoring toss while
    Pat Malone, a junior end, made a spectacular grab between two de fenders.

Heading: Fraternities, Frosh in Fall Sports
Content: by Pete Cowman The Bucknell 1960 intramural season is now in full swing with
    teams formed from i the various fraternities and freshmen dorms vying for
    top honors. Each dorm and fraternity will compete in soccer, handball, ten
    nis, and cross-country during the fall season. The soccer program is well on
    its way, with two fraternity leagues and a freshman league. The LCA's, SX
    and PKP's, and 12A Swartz are leading their pres ent leagues to this date.
    The in- terfratemity champions will play the frosh league leaders for the
    overall supremacy. Interfratemity tennis has com pleted the first round of
    competi tion., DU was victorious over KS, SAE over PGD, PLT over SX, SPE
    over KDR. and SAM over ; LCA. TX, PKP, and TKE all i drew a bye in the first
    round. | The freshmen have not yet played | their first round, but expect to
    ; complete it by the end of this I week. The intramural handball has I two
    fraternity leagues. At the i 'present moment PGD and DU are 1 tied for the
    lead of the "A" !league; PKP and SAM are dead- i locked fdr the lead in the
    "B" i league. Cross country sigh-ups start on I Wednesday, October 12, and
    end j Monday, October 31. Each team | must have eight members. All | team
    members must have at least i eight workouts previous to the race. Four men
    from each team must finish the race in 25 minutes | or under in order to
    receive the | 20 entrance points. The meet will I be held on November 2. by
    Ted Odenwedd Expecting "the roughest game yet" with unbeaten Rutgers, Coach
    Bob Odett describes the opponents' new Do able-Wing T formation as "allnost
    like looking at our formation irf a mirror." The new formation, introduced
    by first-year coach John Bateman, I replaces the Scarlet Knight's Single-
    Wing offense. Like the | Single-Wing alignment, the new I Double-Wing T uses
    an unbalanc ed line. The Double-Wing T has I a quarterback who takes the
    ball # directly from the center. The I halfbacks are split to the sides,
    beyond the ends. The Bisons also use an unbalanced line with a T j
    quarterback, but the ends are! split with' the halfbacks situated I between
    the ends and the tackles. I The two teams are not only j similar in that
    their offesive; alignments are alike, but also in that both teams use two
    units in terchangeably. Coach Odell feels that the use of two units has
    helped the Bisons more than any other thing this season. "The op ponents,"
    he claims, "can't afford to relax when another team comes in because the
    second team is not second-string." Outstanding Defense Both Rutgers and
    Bucknell have been outstanding on de fense. The Bisons have given up 22
    points in three games. They have yielded 389 yards to the op ponents'
    rushing attacks and 216 yards to the aerial attacks. Of 61 attempted passes,
    the oppon ents have completed 20 for a .328 percentage. The Bisons have in-
    i tercepted seven passes. In three games, Rutgers has been scored upon three
    times, once by Princeton and twice by I Colgate. Senior guard, Larry Brown
    has been excellent in de fense. Against Princeton, Larry was in the game on
    33 defensive plays and made 14 tackles. Last week, Rutgers overwhelm ed
    Colgate, 49-12. The standout for the Scarlet Knights was a 6-4, 200-pound
    quarterback, Sam Mudie. Mudie scored 15 points as he scampered for two touch
    downs and kicked an 18 yard field goal. He ran, passed, and punt ed the
    Jerseyites to their third consecutive victory, and earned a place on the
    All-East "Team of the Week." Tully and Simms Coach Odell is particularly im
    pressed by Rutgers' two fullbacks, Bill Tully and Steve Simms. Against
    Colgate, Simms was the Knights' workhorse carrying the ball 18 times for a
    net yardage of 98. Both Tully and Simms are 6-0, weighing in at 200 and 210
    pounds, respectively. The Scarlet's line averages 215 pounds. All of the
    starting line men are veterans of last season's campaign except center Alex
    Kroll. Kroll, a 6-2, 228-pound army veteran, centered for Yale in 1956 and
    received All-Ivy League honors. The starting tackles will be Jud Pahls and
    Bob Blanchfield. Cap tain Les Senft and Jim Homer will be the starting
    guards with Paul Benke and George Darling ton stationed at the end
    positions. Am y Byrd and Dick Webb will start at the halfbacks. Though it
    was feared at the beginning of the season that Byrd and Webb couldn't play
    because of leg in juries, both have played steadily. Byrd scored two
    touchdowns against Colgate, the first a 10- yard jaunt, and the second a 3-
    yard plunge. Coach Odell is building up his (Continued on Page 8)

    press con ference President Eisenhower credited Nixon with always pro viding
    his opinions in Cabinet and other advisory meetings. Eisen hower also said
    that Nixon was w ell informed in the matters of the state as befits his
    position. A t a fund raising dinner in Chicago on September 29, Presi dent
    Eisenhower reiterated his confidence in Richard Nixon's ex perience. The
    President was out spoken in his .praise of the Vice President as being
    qualified and well prepared to serve as Presi dent of the United States. In
    re ferring to Nixon as an advisor, he said, "His counsel has been invaluable
    to me." Conflict in Democratic Logic Now we have to consider the ! conflict
    in the Democratic logic. Senator Kennedy has been very critical of the
    Republican admin istration of the last eight years. He has charged it with
    lackadai sical leadership which has failed in substantially advancing the
    cause of the United States both in economic affairs and in foreign affairs.
    He has been focusing the responsibility of this slack on the shoulders of
    the Republican Party and especially, Mr. Nixon. Sena tor Kennedy, in a
    speech on Oc tober 2, said that he was not at tacking President Eisenhower,
    but throughout his campaign he has attacked the administration for which
    Eisenhower is responsible.

Heading: What, Me Campaign?
Content: On Tuesday, Oct; 18, a man who is a candidate for the office of Vice-President
    of the United States delivered a speech from the steps of the courthouse in
    downtown Lewisburg. Granted that this was far from a major po litical
    address, none-the-less it was important. The lack of student interest cannot
    be wholly attributed to the party to which this man belongs. There is almost
    little or no student interest in the election. There is a Demo cratic
    student group, but their organization is due more to the efforts of the
    faculty advisor than any student con cern. All we wish to say at this point
    is that we feel that it is indeed unfortunate that the student body is so
    preoccu pied with trivia that it cannot get down and come to grips with the
    issues of our time. Republican or Democrat, it makes no difference. There
    should be an active interest and concern on the parts of a group of college
    students. No matter how many buildings we have, no matter how many high
    school valedictorians make up the freshman class, Bucknell will be a second
    rate school until it starts accepting students who are not all from the same
    mold, a very unfortunate one at that. This complete or near- complete lack
    of student interest in a national election is something for all of Bucknell
    to be ashamed of. It is we, the students, who can change this situation. We
    must look beyond the "Friendly 300," and be ready for what we see.

Heading: Parents-- Why Bother?
Content: The weekend of Oct. 7, was officially designated as Parents' Weekend. However,
    orte is hard pressed to find any justification for that designation. It
    certainly couldn't have been as a result of the appearance of the Dave Bru-
    beck group, for this group is not universally accepted on the college scene;
    therefore what possible reason could there have been for the choice of a
    group which is one of the most misunderstood and also one which is far from
    popular with parents? Everybody likes football games so we can find no quar
    rel there. Unfortunately, Saturday evening was the oc casion for the first
    annual Bucknell Parent's Dance, an affair which could conceivably be held
    only on centennial years without making any substantial number of people
    unhappy. The Bucknellian, while wholly in accord with the concept of
    Parents' Weekend, strongly recommends that the scheduled events be
    considered in light of the fact that the weekend is designed for parents.
    One reflection of Parents' Weekend in and around Lew isburg is that all
    restaurant prices go up. We feel that the students should protest this type
    of action on the part of the various restauranters in the area. We hope that
    next year, and ensuing years, will see a Parents' Week end program designed
    with some thought to the parents. more "intellectually oriented townspeople.
    Unfortunately, the speech that they heard, was aim ed at the backwoodsmen of
    Penn sylvania. Lawrence Speaks Governor Lawrence's introduc tion included a
    comment on the wisdom of the Democratic party in nominating for vice

    and most inspir ed performances ever staged by a Bucknell football team. To
    all Bison supporters and especially the players and #coaches, this praise is
    realistically little consolation, for victory was so nearly in our grasp. We
    lost the game, *but won the praise of the press and of Bucknell and Rut gers

    without it, we are justly proud of the team who literally played the game of
    its life. Congratulations, Bisons!

    much overacting, but this was mainly because the actors had to express their
    emo tions without speech. This movie had its humorous moments, but it
    certainly was never meant to be taken as a comedy. For example, I would like
    to know what was so hilarious about the tortured Quasimodo grimacing at his
    tor mentors? The 1922 version of The Hunch back of Notre Dame is as serious
    a movie as can| be seen today, even more so than most Holly wood "serious"
    productions. Un fortunately, many thought it was a comedy; even three
    professors of Buckpell could not restrain themselves| from ridiculing the
    film from beginning to end. One of their "wittiest" remarks came when the
    French soldiers were galloping through the streets of Paris. "Here come the
    Bucks!" one of them shouted. This, among their other unintelligent com
    ments, # was in extremely poor taste and ruined the movie for those
    unfortunate people wfio were close enough to hear them. I must not forget
    the accompany ing music and chatter from the projection room, which
    constantly diverted the attention of those interested in the film. Anyone of
    these actions alone would have been enough to an noy someone; the three
    together literally made one sick. t Some how, through all of this, a few
    people were still| overwhelmed by Lon Chaney's superbly mov ing portrayal of
    the hunchback. Therefore, let us hope that in tlje future, when serious
    films are presented at Hilltop, only uncommitted nations, who are looking to
    see whether freedom or Communism is best for their children. War Hero Using
    the epithet of "popular war hero" for Ike, the senator artfully slipped in
    his own quali fications on the basis of 30 years of experience in
    Washington. Johnson then stated the idea which served as the keystone for
    his speech: the Democrats will be in control of Congress again this term; in
    order to avoid a govern ment "by veto and by stalemate," we must have "a
    Democratic pilot if we have a Democratic co-pilot at the controls of our jet
    plane." Johnson reiterated his belief that it is not the duty of the op
    position to oppose, and he related his record of cooperation during his work
    as majority leader with a Republican administration. Tak ing a commendable
    stand, John son specifically cited two civil rights bills which he had
    passed and which had been denied by President Eisenhower. Nixon Noose
    Skillfully slipping a noose around the necks of his oppon ents, the vice
    presidential candi date satirized Nixon, who told Kennedy that it was
    unpatriotic to talk about foreign policy, then insisted on discussing Quemoy
    and Matsu. "If he wants to talk about islands, why not talk about Cuba only
    90 miles off the Florida !coast?" thundered Johnson. Predicting that the

    SUBSCRIPTION, $4.00, elective September 1957, payable m ad- vance. Entered
    as second class matter on September 21, 1922, at the post office Lewisburg,
    Pennsylvania under the Act of March 9, 1979. Lewisburg 1852. < In view of
    the recent criticism of colleg policies as being too liberal it seems well
    to enumerate at this time a few of the regula tions under which the students
    at the University now live. The following rules set down in the interest of
    propriety are strictly enforced: * ' 1. Every teacher is authorized to enter
    any student room at any time, and if entrance be denied, the instructor may
    break down the door and enter. The cost of damages in any such | warming up
    to his subject, incident shall be assumed by the offending student. 2.
    Strict study hours are prescribed in which the student is ex pected to apply
    himself with diligence; and such of the time as is not devoted to
    recitations he shall remain in his room. 3. Every student shall attend the
    daily devotional exercises in the chapel at 7:30 a! m. 4. Students may not
    gather in recitation room more than five minutes before or after the
    appointed time unless special per mission has been granted. 5. No student
    shall attend any theatrical entertainment or use less show in Lewisburg. 6.
    Woinen students may go into town only when accompanied by a woman teacher
    with at least six years of experience in handling girls. publicans, speaking
    of them as a "small party which he'd like to keep that way!" In a burst of
    enthusiasm, John son restated his earlier battle cry, "What's best for
    America is best for the Democratic party."

    "What's best for General Motors is not best for the United States." With the
    candi date's mounting enthusiasm and forcefulness, the crowd became more
    responsive. Grand Finale Terminating his speech at an apex of exhuberance,
    Johnson vowed, "Vote for qs in November, and we'll do something about Mr.
    Castro, as well as Quemoy and Matsu." Many of Johnson's points were well-
    taken and well presented, although he wasted the better part of his speaking
    time in Had he let loose with more of his sense of humor, the college
    audience might have better responded to the Democratic nominee. As it was, a
    fair amount of enthusiasm was generated by the students for Kennedy, among
    whose ranks were the attractive "Johnson Girls," adorning the post office
    steps.

Heading: itepoAi, Homecoming Fetes Alumni;
Content: Because of dissatisfaction with last year's election of senior stu dents to
    Who's Who Among Stu dents in American Universities and Colleges, the method
    of elec tion has been changed this year. Previously the election was handled
    by a committee, headed by the president of the senior class, which sent
    notices to all campus organizations asking that they submit the names of mem
    bers worthy of being named to Who's Who. The responsibility for the elec
    tion has now been delegated to the Student-Faculty Congress. SFC will send
    notices to all cam pus organizations, giving them the opportunity of
    suggesting out standing seniors. All students who are suggested by the organ
    izations will be given a form to complete, listing activities and scholastic
    average. Ballot Composed A committee, numbering six to 10 members of the
    faculty, stu dent body and administration, will screen the forms, placing ap
    proximately 50 people on the bal lot. This ballot will then be sent to every
    senior in the university. The seniors will return the ballots to SFC for
    final tabulation. The quota for Who's Who this year is from 28 to 32
    students. Any sug gestion for improvement of the method of election may be
    sent to Joe Ciffolillo. Purpose Named Who's Who Among Students in American
    Universities and Col leges is a publication offering na tional recognition
    for college stu dents on a democratic basis de void of dues and initiation
    fees. Recognition by Who's Who means I that the student was, first, offici

    The Judical Board of the Men's Student Government has operat ed in its
    present form for five years. The original court was re defined and
    reorganized by Dean Hayward. Until recently the board only made
    recommendations concern ing cases to the administration. Now, any decision
    made, with the .exception of those which involve separation from the
    University, is final. Separation decisions, that is: suspension or
    expulsion, are still in the form of a recommend ation. To this date, every
    decis ion has been executed. Responsibilities As a part of MSG, the Judicial
    i Board is responsible for the gen eral conduct and actions of all : the
    male students. It not only | punishes, but helps or refers in -. dividuals
    to helpful agencies. Re habilitation is an important part of discipline.
    Another aspect of the Board's ! responsibility concerns town - 1 gown
    relations: to repair and create good sentiment with the ! townspeople and
    police force. For example, the Judicial Board recently held a banquet for
    the Police Chiefs in the area with the representatives of student govern
    ment organizations. Not only was a working relationship with # these people
    facilitated, but ques tions of policy and ordinances : were discussed.
    Procedure The Board operates on a three point foundation which may vary with
    the needs of each case. The Board discusses and deliberates cases after
    receiving a statement from the police, if involved; the administration, if
    involved; and the student. Members of the t Board often interview persons
    directly or indirectly involved in order to have as complete a story as
    possible. Then, the individual is called before the board so that his .side
    may be heard. After a period of interrogation, the de fendant is excused and
    the Board members deliberate, reaching a decision. A majority vote of the
    nine members is necessary to es tablish a decision, while a recom mendation
    for dismissal requires a two-thirds vote. Three Penalties Briefly, a number
    one warning entails a strong verbal reprimand; a number two decision might
    re quire a "campus" probation, or a | letter home. The number three penalty
    is a recommendation for separation from Bucknell. Such (Continued on Page

Heading: Recommendations on Cheating Control
Content: by Deanna Rosen Last year, a committee headed by Dr. Philip Harriman, was formed
    to investigate the problem of cheating on the Bucknell cam pus. The
    committee was com posed of both faculty members and students who were
    selected by the administration to report the problems of dishonesty on the
    campus and to suggest possible solutions. After the report was presented to
    the academic dean and the committee was dissolved the fol lowing
    recommendations were made this year. , First offense: Dismissal from class
    and failure in course; warn ing of the consequences of a second offense.
    Second offense: Dismissal from the^University. Cheating Attempts Attempts at
    cheating should be treated in the same fashion as successfully completed
    acts of cheating. Students who allow others to copy in examinations or who
    in other ways enable fellow- students to cheat should be sub ject to the
    same punishment as cheaters. Students apprehended while engaged in
    commercialized cheat ing and/or acts of criminal de linquency connected with
    chew ing should be immediately expell- j ed from the University. In cases of
    illegal acts of delinquency | (such as burglary), the possibili-! ties of
    preferring criminal charges I I should be carefully considered. Offense
    Publicized The Dean of the University i | will post -in a public place the I
    name of each cheater, indicate the I nature of the offense, and state I the
    punishment given. Cheating offenses may be dealt I with on the departmental
    level in | accordance with the policies indi cated above, provided that: (a)
    I the Dean of the University is in- | formed in writing of the facts and
    action taken, second offenses may be identified and dealt with, and ! due
    publicity given; and (b) ap- | peals may be taken to the Dean of the
    University; in any appeal ! the Dean shall hear both the stu dent and those
    who have evidence of cheating, and his decision shall be final. Cases of
    suspected (but 1 not provable) cheating should be referred to the Dean for
    record.

Content: When the future looks foggy, it's time to focus on the present! Maybe the
    prescription you need is a good start on your lifetime financial planning.
    Life Insurance is an important part of that picture, and begin ning your
    life insurance program now will sharpen your vision of the future
    considerably. The only investment which gives you a combination of
    guaranteed pro tection and savings, life insur ance also offers you
    excellent collateral for the future. We'd like the opportunity to talk with
    you about a variety of up- to-date plans which can be tai lored to your
    individual needs. Stop by or telephone. W hen John Hulse was a senior at the
    U . of South pakota, he had his own set of " do's"  and " don'ts." Don't
    become a-mere cipher on some body's payroll. Don't sit on the shelf waiting
    for your first taste of responsibility. Do get a job where you have a chance
    to show your stuff right from the start. Do the job. John knew his B .S. in
    Business Administra tion could lead him into almost any field. He chose the
    telephone business and joined North western Bell. One of his first
    assignments: streamlining oper ating procedures for the telephone offices of
    Iowa's five largest cities. In this work John showed good judgment and sound
    organizing ability. Today he is Telephone Manager of Sioux C ity, Iowa.
    Besides managing day-to-day operations, helping plan tomorrow's telephone
    growth is an important part of John's job. A  typical ex ample is the work
    he does with the Sioux City Industrial Development Association. In this
    role, he's the answer man on projecting, planning and supplying the
    communications needs of new in dustry. He's shown above with Bob Sweeney,
    manager of the Sioux City Chamber of Commerce. " You must always be thinking
    of the future in this business,"  John says. " W e have to stay ahead. I
    think a man who has something to offer this outfit won't have a minute's
    worry about what it can do for him." I f  you're a capable guy-- looking for
    an action' job with rapid rewards for the man who can handle it--you'll want
    to visit your Placement Office for literature and additional information. Xi

Heading: The Sidelines
Content: by Sieve Skinner An Emolioal Experience Coach Bob Odell by this time must have
    run the gauntlet of emotions that a coach is capable of enduring over his
    charges. If there was ever a time when a Bison football team "played its
    heart out," it was last Saturday when Rutgers University was forced to go
    the Frank Merriwell route to edge a fighting Bucknell squad. Odell had to
    face disappointment and frustration in his first game when he lost a star
    lineman and barely beat a fired up Gettysburg team that halted three Bison
    drives inside the ten yard line. Of course, there was some compensation in
    the sparkling play of sophomore Dick Johnson and the fine running of Ray
    Cosgrove. But the victory was a costly and not very satisfying one. Cornell
    Disappointing Against Cornell Coach Odell watched his team suffer under the
    oppressive weight of penalties. Knowing that the coach would never use the
    officiating as an excuse, it nonetheless left something to be desired.
    Despite some outstanding individual performances, the BU Bisons just
    couldn't make the best of an "if" game. Buffalo Was The Best After the
    depressing show at Cornell, the day that every coach dreams of became a
    reality for Odell as his proteges romped over a favored Buffalo team, 41-0.
    The exhiliaration and feeling that such a victory can inspire gave the coach
    and the players the confidence and spirit that came within a hair of beating
    one of the best football teams Bucknell has ever played, as reported by the
    scouts. The last three minutes of the Rutgers game had to remind fans of the
    dream of ten days ago in Forbes Field. Rutgers Pulls a World Series Play
    Bucknell led 19-15 with that three 'short minutes looking like three days to
    Bison fans and three years to Bob Odell. It was too much to hope for a
    victory over a team that had led 15-6 at the inter mission and had a much
    bigger team to work with in the second half. The fact that the Bisons were
    outweighed man for man seemed to matter very little to the Bucknell squad,
    which met every play head on in a bone-jarring contest. Bison Linemen Took a
    Beating With three minutes to go Bucknell kicked off and Rutgers return ed
    the ball all the way back to the Bison 39-yard line. That was the key play
    and the momentum of Rutgers proved too much for a Bison team that had
    suffered "punishment" in the line the whole game.

Content: beautiful pass play by the hosts with a single minute to go provided a painful
    ending to a game that almost was. The Odellians manner was not to be one of
    chagrin, disgust, and despair, but rather one of praise for a great team
    effort. So Coach Bob Odell has come the route with his squad. From anxiety
    to frus tration to exhiliaration to a nameless emotion bordering disappoint
    ment and shock. The life of a coach is anything but idyllic. Turk The
    Magnificent About four Saturdays ago Bucknell fans eyed the statistics of
    the first football game and saw that Paul Terhes had completed about half
    his passes for about 100 yards. Was this the end of Turk as the MAC passing
    king and number on o quarterback? Against Cornell, Terhes threw five times
    as many pisses for only 30 additional yards. In two games 20 passes were
    good for 238 yards. In the Buffalo romp, Turk's passing was good, but
    matched by Rick Elliot, and soph Doug Williams tossed three that were good
    for 58 yards. Bison fans anxiously began to wonder whether or not Terhes
    could top last sea son's record of 97 completions good for 831 yards and
    retain his All- MAC status. Last Saturday Turk put an end to those doubts.
    Terhes To Tyrrell At the beginning of the season Terhes was not blessed with
    a first rate receiver the likes of Jack Eachus, but to all intents and
    purposes " Turk the Magnificent" has found his boy. Paul completed 2k of 29
    passes for 245 yards and three touchdowns. At the catching end of a good
    deal of Turk's aerials was soph Dick Tyrrell. Despite the loss to Rutgers,
    Turk was named ECAC quarterback of the week. He is now near 500 yards in
    four games. There is no doubt about it That's All-American material. Tyrrell
    was given an honorable mention' nod to the All-ECAC team. Not bad for a
    fellow who wasn't slated to start all season and who didn't catch a pass in
    the first game. Swimming practice has already begun for the MAC champions of
    last year. Individual event champs Bill Dearstyne and Bill Dorr at the

Content: by John Minsker The freshman soccer team has gotten off to a bumpy start this
    year, as coach John Gold has had to compose a team from, only 17 players.
    The team's first game was played after only five days of practice. The squad
    has played two games thus far, having lost to Penn State and Susquehanna Uni
    versity. The frosh lost their first game at Penn State by a- 9-0 score, but
    came back strongly in their second encounter and led Susquehanna 1-0 at
    halftime, but fell 5-2 at the game's end. The team showed a great deal of im
    provement in the Susquehanna game and with continued effort like that, they
    may yet have a winning season. Bucknell's cen ter-forward, Bill Munger,

    ball into the nets to give the Bisons their early lead. The other BU goal
    was scored by Bob Lomicky late in the second half. Bob ripped the cords with
    a sensational follow shot of a direct kick. Goalie,'Rick Bewlay, has made
    numerous outstanding saves in the past two games and has got ten acclaim
    from all of his team mates. Forwards Doug May and A1 Gutermuth have been
    very aggressive on offense for the BU frosh, while Chet Bushnell, left
    fullback, has played brilliantly on defense. Chet has kept the ball away
    from the goal many times with his long kicks. The rundown of the players
    shows a forward line of: Jeff Bahls (wing), Ron Dow (inside), A1 Gutermuth
    (inside), Tom Har ris (wing), Doug May (inside), Bill Munger (center), Carl
    Rogge wing), Kent Withers (wing), and John Richards (inside). The half backs
    are Ivars Blumenaus, Bob Lomicky, Oren Oeschger, and Bill Raynor. Chet

Heading: PAUL TERHES
Content: Paul Terhes, Bucknell senior from Milmont, Pa., was named All-East Quarterback
    of the Week by the various sports writers on the eastern seaboard. The honor
    came to Terhes because of a spec tacular performance in defeat. The 6' 185
    quarterback threw 29 passes against Rutgers and com pleted 21 of them, good
    for 245 yards, and yet lost the game 23- 19 thanks to some last heroics by
    the host team. Terhes has been accorded a number of honors for his uncanny
    passing ability, including two suc cessive selections as All-Middle Atlantic
    Conference quarterback. He holds several MAC records and numerous Bucknell
    marks. His effort at New Brunswick last Saturday fell two passes short of
    the 23 completed last season against Delaware when Paul broke the Conference
    record for number of completions. In last year's campaign Terhes complet ed
    97 of 173 passes for 831 yards and is well on his way to break ing that
    school record. The " Turk" is well on his way to breaking the total offense
    record at Bucknell held by Brad Myers. In 22 games Terhes has passed for
    2222 yards, completing 216 of 413 attempted. He's chuck ed for 13 touchdowns

    kickoff to their own 30-yard line, the Bisons moved on Terhes' passing up to

    drove to the Rutgers 20. This drive was featured by Terhes' 21-yard and j
    16-yard passes to Ditka and Tyr- | rell, respectively. The Bisons were

    points putting Rutgers ahead, 8-0. In the second period, after an exchange
    of interceptions, Buck nell took over on its own 42-yard line. On five
    consecutive plays, fullback Twiford carried picking up a total of 11 yards.
    With a third and five situation from the I Rutgers 32-yard line, Terhes com
    pleted a 26-yard pass play to Dit ka. From the six-yard line, Terhes fired a
    touchdown pass to Maslanik. The extra point was missed. After an exchange of
    punts, Rutgers moved 55-yards in five plays, to a 15-7 lead. Speranza again
    led the attack with passes of 11'and 20 yards. v In the third period,
    Bucknell moved to the Scarlets' 21-yard line but failed to score. Foulke
    Recovers Fumble In two plays, Kirk Foulke had recovered a fumble, and the BU
    Bisons were threatening again. This time the drive didn't fail. Twiford
    carried three consecutive times for gains of 15, three, and two yards,
    respectively. Terhes then completed a 4-yard pass to Melberger on the four-
    yard line. Terhes hit Tyrrell in the end zone and Maslanik kicked the extra
    point to close the score to 15-13. In the fourth period, the Bisons again
    drove down to Rutgers' 14- yard line, but a fourth down, Terhes to Twiford
    pass was in complete. In eight plays, Rutgers moved the ball to Bucknell's

    15-yard stripe, halting the drive. An exchange of punts gave the Bisons a
    first and 10 on their own (Continued on Page 8) of color and excitement.
    Lafayette, last year's winner, has a decided edge in the overall series
    (21-11-4), but the Maroon and White will have plenty of trouble keeping up
    with the BU Bisons this year. Jim McCon- logue, head coach for the Lafay
    ette Leopards, is pinning his hopes on a fast but inexperienced team. Only
    nine lettermen are returning from last year's squad. Good Running Attack
    Lafayette is traditionally an ag gressive, offensive type ball club. Last
    year they were second in the league in rushing offense, total offense, and
    scoring. They will feature much the same type of football again this year. .
    The in vaders from Easton will again feature an excellent running at tack,
    centered around veteran halfback, Charlie Bartos. Bartos was one of the
    league's leaders in rushing, passing, scoring and total bffense last season.
    Another returning letterman, John Franco, will start at fullback, while Walt
    Doleschal, a junior, will probably fill the other halfback position in the
    Leopards precision backfield. The Easton men will sorely miss Don Nikles,
    fullback for the past three years, who is now trying out with the Pittsburgh

    each player through each play and grade him on his performance. * If a
    player does exceptionally well he is given a grade of five; if he is not so
    exceptional he may receive as little as one point. Each player's points are
    then totaled and averaged so that he will have trouble trying to run through
    the heavier Bison line. What to Look For Lafayette will use a split T- j
    formation offense, with Mike Dill probably barking the signals. They will
    feature primarily a running game with Charlie Bar tos doing most of the ball
    toting. Most of the plays will be run to the outside as the Leopards fea
    ture a speedy backfield with half back Walt Doleschal being the fastest on
    the team. Bartos is the only strong runner through the middle. With rookies
    at quarterback and the ends, the Maroon and White will not do too much pass
    ing. When they do, the experi enced backfield men will do a lot of the
    receiving. The Leopards also like to throw passes from the option series,
    with the halfbacks doing the pitching. Look for Doleschal to quick kick on
    third down when his team is deep in their own territory. He was the leading
    punter in the league last season. On defense, the Leopards will be quick but
    may have trouble stopping the Bisons on the ground, due to their weight
    shortage. The key figures to watch are Bartos and center Bob Haward, on of-
    of the National Football League. . Finding a capable quarterback fense an<I
    defense respectively. is one of Coach McConlogue's big gest problems. With
    no return ing lettermen at this position, he will have to rely on junior,
    Mike Dill and sophomore, Ray Mayer. These two boys will be tossing their
    passes to inexperienced ends The encounter will be a typically hard fought
    and spirited one, but the Bisons should make the old grads grin. Drive slow
    or you may go!

    Gettysburg frosh to defeat the Bucknell Baby Bisons 14-13 last Friday night.
    Bucknell frosh led throughout the game but Gettys burg, never giving up,
    came on strongly to score the winning points with 50 seconds left. Bob Fumey
    kicked off for Get tysburg. Don Rodgers returned the kickoff 14 yards to the
    Buck nell 40. Neither team moved well in the opening minutes and, after an
    exchange of punts, Bucknell took over on the midfield stripe. Rodgers ran
    around end for the first down. On the next play Gettysburg recovered a
    Bucknell fumble on their own 27 yard line. Joe Elliot, on the following
    play, recovered a Gettysburg fumble on the 16 yard line. Runs by Matt Hart
    and Don Rogers earned a first down. With six minutes left in the quarter A1
    Siegfried took a pitchout around right end for the first score of the game.
    Siegfried kicked the extra point and Buck nell led 7-0. Gettysburg was again
    stopped by the Bucknell defense and was forced to punt. Bucknell took over
    near midfield and rolled up a first down on four running plays. Don Rodgers
    then threw a 40 yard touchdown pass to Matt Hart. The try for the extra
    point was wide and Bucknell led 13-0 at the end of the quarter. The entire
    second quarter was a battle of defense. Each team was forced to punt three
    times in this period. Good defense for Bucknell was turned in by John
    Thornton and Joe Elliot. At half time the score was still 13-0. On the first
    play from scrim mage of the second half Bucknell recovered a fumble on the
    Gettys burg 21. The Bisons could not move the ball and, on fourth down,
    attempted a field goal. The kick was short and Gettysburg took over.
    Gettysburg went no- ' where and was forced to punt. Bucknell took over on
    its own 48 yard line. Two running plays picked up a first down. At this
    point the game reached its turning point. A1 Siegfried was forced to leave
    the game with a broken ankle. After Siegfried's injury, Bucknell managed to
    get only one first down and had dif ficulty movng the ball. After another
    Bucknell punt, Gettysburg took over on their own seven yard line. Hoffman
    gave Gettysburg some running room, going around his own left end for seven
    yards. A  nice de fensive play by Larry Pollack, Ben Dekker, and Jim Hicks
    forc ed the Bullets to punt. Bucknell also was forced to punt and the
    Bullets had the ball on their own 20 yard line. On the second play, Lynn

    left end for a touchdown. The kick was wide and the Bisons led 13-6.- The

    important also. In the first game of the season Ron Mhslanik was able to
    grab four passes, enough for 34 yards and "one touchdown as he captured the
    coveted defensive laurels. In addition, Maslanik was all over the field on
    defense. Inflicting his own private reign of terror at both ends of the
    line, the six-foot junior from Saxton, Pa. was several times knocked down,
    only to get up and be in on the tackle.

    The hatchet plaque went to Kirk Foulke in the Buffalo game. Of Foulke only
    good things can be said. Largely responsible for breaking Buffalo's double

    been outstanding on de fans,e in every game to date.

    on the grid iron. Bob Patzwall, last year's big, bruising tackle, received
    the as signment of assistant line coach for the varsity squad, concen
    trating mainly on the tackle posi tion. Bob is presently here at Bucknell on
    a scholarship and is working, aside from his football duties, for his
    master's degree in j history. Giving Bob Latour, head frosh ! coach, a hand
    with his squad is I last year's' varsity end Doug ! Forsythe. The freshmen

    # valuable advice. Off the foot ball field Doug is doing graduate !work

    first down on their 25. After Tyrrell caught a six-yard pass, Twiford
    plunged up the middle for a yard gain. Terhes then hit Johnson and Tyr rell
    consecutively for gains of 18 and 10 yards. This placed the !ball on
    Rutgers' 40-yard line. 1 Terhes found Johnson in the open ! antj fired a
    beautiful touchdown pass, putting the Bisons ahead, 19-15. Speranza took
    Bucknell's kick off and returned it 43 yards to the Bison 39-yard marker. In
    six plays, the Scarlet had regained the lead. Harv Engle scored the
    touchdown on a 13-yard pass from Mudie. With less than two minutes re
    maining in the game, the Bisons received the kickoff. Cosgrove i returned it
    to the 39-yard line. Terhes attempted seven passes in the next sequence of
    plays, com pleting three. With a third down, Terhes tried a fullback draw to
    Twiford who barrelled for 15 yards to the Rutgers 32-yard marker. Before the
    Herd could j get in another play, the game- j ending gun had been fired.
    Statistics reveal the tremendous j job done by the Bisons. The Rut- | gers
    squad, which had averaged 1265 yards per game on the ! ground, could only
    gain 77 rush ing yards against the strong Bison I defense. Terhes completed
    21 of 29 j passes for 245 yards. The 245 yards is a schcool single game I
    record. The former record of 199 yards was set by Tommy Dean in 1951 against
    Colgate. Tyrrell tied a school record by yards is a school single game Jack
    Eachus set the record last season against Delaware. Bucknell's leading
    ground-gain- | er was Twiford with 51 yards on 15 carries. Alcohol and
    gasoline do not mix on the Bucknell campus. A study of medical students
    shows them to have an average I. Q. of 127 as against a national average of

Content: Annually, The Experiment in International Living receives formal applications
    from many American students who wish to participate in its overseas pro gram
    for junior-grade ambassa dors. After the customary rigors of examination and
    cross exam ination, Jane Carson was admit ted to the group of one thousand
    undergraduates privileged to spend the summer in Europe un der the auspices
    of The Experi-! ment. ing of what those miles mean to the people who inhabit
    them. To ward this end the European pil grimage is arranged on a 'Family
    Plan'. Each student is assigned a host family by The Experiment. Those who
    are not fluent in any foreign language are dispatched to family groups where
    at least one person speaks English. Some countries, France in particular,
    will not ad mit candidates who are not fluent in the native tongue.

Heading: Jane's Family
Content: Jane Carson spent her four weeks as an ambassador-guest with a middle-aged
    couple in Baden, Switzerland. Her Swiss parents spoke fluent French but no
    English. Baden is in the Ger man section of Switzerland where the local
    tongue is a dialect of German derivation totally incom prehensible to most
    Germans. The Bucknell junior found no . great barrier, for the Swiss are
    generally a very linguistic people. Many are fluent in German, French and
    Italian, and the new generation invariably understands English. In' the
    course of several side trips with her host fafnily Jane visited Lausanne,
    Geneva and Shauffhausen (The City of the Rhein Falls). Her favorite city was
    Bern, a metropolis abounding with quaint remembrances of I small Swiss
    towns. Bern harbors I lovely capitol buildings, Countless clock towers,
    flowery window boxes, and of course the Bear Pits which gave the capitol its
    name. War Orphans The Experiment sponsors its pilgrim participants by
    providing contacts, special information and chartered transportation. Stu
    dents ordinarily pay their own fare, although The Experiment offers several
    scholarships to out standing candidates who could not otherwise participate
    in the overseas program. Trans-Atlantic traffic usually involves charter ed
    planes and ships. After ar riving in Europe, students separ ate into groups
    of 10 according to general destination. Though they live separately, group
    members frequently meet for hosteling and casual side trips.

Content: "American girls are on the whole more attractive than Eng lish girls, but a lot
    of the latter are more on the ball--better con versationalists." This alert,
    con scious, critical attitude of the stu dents at the University of Edin
    burgh was one of the many facets of his year in Scotland under the Junior
    Year Abroad program which impressed David Welsh. David was also very enthusi
    astic about the program of studies at the University. In the three courses
    which he took for the year, he had examinations only at the ends of the
    three terms ! plus intermittent term papers With the fewer number of courses
    than we take, with the continu- s ance of them throughout the year, and with
    the absence of periodic ally distracting tests, the student in Edinburgh is
    able to spend more time on his subjects and go far deeper into them. David
    found himself able to take even- I ings off to attend concerts, plays,
    lectures, or whatever interested him, and, if the occasion arose, he could
    make weekend trips about the British Isles. He had many comments to make
    about the students he met, I the University, the city of Edin- I hu^gh, and
    the Scotch people, but I most of his reactions may be sum-* med up with his
    most typical one, "It was just tremendous." About his only objection to Edin
    burgh was the lack of central heating in the "digs" (furnished rooms). He
    said his space heater ! would only warm half of him at a time, and it was a
    bitter cold winter. *

    schools on campus; a summer school for Spaniards, one for foreigners (which
    Miss Chew attended), and one for Classrooms Abroad. The latter was attended

    portrays itself as the party of free enterprise en veloping the efforts of

    will the United States maintain maximum economic growth. The Republican
    Platform states it this way: "We therefore accord high priority to vigorous

    the factors considered by the judges included original ity, group
    participation, and at tractiveness. The awards for these floats were made
    available by the Lewisburg merchants. Monetary awards were also provided by
    the Lewisburg mer chants for the winning bands and plaques were awarded to
    each visiting band. The awards for the bands were as follows: first prize,

Heading: Traditions Tried
Content: This past weekend, Homecoming was observed with the usual traditions which have
    characterized this campus for nearly a half century. Students in sororities
    and fraterni ties stayed up all night stuffing paper napkins in chicken wire
    in order to entertain the citizens of Lewisburg for an hour the next day.
    Women in small dorms spent hours of time stringing tin cans and painting
    spotted leopards in competition for a prize. This year, more than in others,
    a conflict was presented. Six weeks grades reared an ugly head and leered at
    stu dents over the coffee cup and the cocktail glass. Expect ed, on the one
    hand, to produce the usual colorful decor ations for Homecoming, and on the
    other, to contribute to their studies an extra amount of work, students gave
    the worst half of their time to both. Far from condemning the new academic
    approach which has stiffened old courses and created challenging new Honors
    sections, we raise the question of "The Old Bucknell" versus the "New."
    Floats were created this year by a small nucleus of people, and the
    antagonism against those "who didn't have time to help" was bitter. House
    decorations were hung with a maximum of grumb ling and a discouraging lack
    of spirit. If this university is to concentrate on learning, and we assume
    that that is its primary goal, perhaps the tradi tional Homecoming
    activities should be re-evaluated. It would seem that the house decorations
    in the Sem could be discarded without losing much sentiment or sleep. For
    those traditionalists who wish to keep the parade, student energy might
    better be divided between floats and studies than between studies and a host
    of insignificant decora- ions. At the risk of being considered eggheads, we
    commend the invasion of challenging young minds on the teaching staff and
    the pulled-up bootstraps of what have been tra ditionally "Q. C. courses."
    Isn't it a shame that student response to these innovations should be
    negligible during the two weeks that "scholars" are preparing for and re
    covering from Homecoming? Although better scheduling of Homecoming with the
    barrage of tests preceding six-week grades is a partial so lution, the
    conflict between the "Old" and the "New" Bucknell is yet to be resolved. As
    students, we cannot consider ourselves members of a university and still
    damn those who study in preference to stuffing paper napkins.

Heading: Everyone Can Vote
Content: On Tuesday, November 1, Bucknellians will, we hope, flock to the polls one week
    before the rest of the nation. An election will be held on this campus in
    which all stu dents and faculty members may vote, regardless of age or out-
    of-state residence. The purpose of the election is to generate some genuine
    political enthusiasm on the part of those unfortunately "set apart" from the
    excitement of the American political scene. Conceivably, the entire student
    body can support such an endeavor by posting campaign signs and wearing cam
    paign buttons for Kennedy and Nixon. Those who cannot vote in the national
    election may show their favor for the party of their choice by taking the
    time to fill out a ballot on Tuesday. Coleman Hall will feature polling
    places manned by po litical science students. The results of the balloting
    will be published in the Bucknellian and will offer valuable information as
    to party affiliations of those attending this particular university. Mock
    conventions and mock elections have been a source of enthusiasm and
    political concern on campuses across the nation for years. The value of such
    an event at Bucknell may only be measured by the support of those who step
    out of their well-worn ruts to manifest an inter est in national affairs. It
    is possible that the mock election will be a dismal failure. If this
    happens, we may consider the student body worse than dismal arid certainly a
    failure. If we call ourselves well-informed and consider ourselves citi zens
    of an enlightened country, we must accept the re sponsibility of voting.

Heading: THE EDITOR
Content: Dear Editor: Generally the Bucknellian has improved its coverage of the po
    litical life of our nation over that of last year. Yet, several com ments
    about this coverage seem to be justified. Last week, the Bucknellian saw I
    fit to cover Johnson's speech but failed to even mention Lodge's speech the
    previous Saturday. This oversight was especially ob- vous in view of the
    fact that the coverage of Johnson was partisan and Republican. I can see the
    point in sending a critical report er to cover a political rally, but; why
    not give equal and similar coverage to both sides? Further, I believe that
    your edi torial writer who wrote, "What, Me Campaign,"  was unfortunate ly
    uninformed about student par ticipation in political activities and the
    relative importance of faculty work. The "Students for Kennedy" or
    ganization, about which I am more informed them about its Re publican
    counterpart, is primarily a student-run organization. Last spring a letter
    was posted on the Political Science Department bul letin board asking for
    students to work on a "Students for Ken nedy" organization on campus.
    Several of us responded and then started to make tentative plans for the
    fall. I worked in the National Stu dents For Kennedy Headquarters this
    summer and several others worked at the local level. Dur ing this time, more
    plans were made for fall via letters to our faculty advisor. Several of
    these plans were not carried out due to lack of cooper ation on the part of
    the adminis tration. For example, the "Stu dents for Kennedy" were not al- i
    lowed to set up a booth at the end I of the registration line.to find in
    terested Democrats or to give out j ! information on absentee voting.
    However, students have taken !the initiative in several areas: 1. Students
    are manning the j I "Citizens for Kennedy" office on j j Market Street every
    day. 2. Students carried on a "D ol-! j lars for Democratss" campaign in i
    Lewisburg. 3. Students distributed litera- j j ture advertising Johnson's
    ap- ! pearance. 4. Students passed out informa- I j tion at the Parents'
    Weekend game. 5. Students attended a local | I Young Democrats for Kennedy;
    meeting in Williamsport to dis cuss local plans. 6. Students served as
    "Johnson | j girls" during the rally last week, j 7. Students have taken the
    ini- ! tiative in organizing a straw poll.! In addition to those who have j
    been able to give time to organiz- ! ed work for the party, many are j |
    working independently by dis cussing politics with their friends, j j Within
    my own party, we have I j found that this method is one of j I the most
    effective methods, al-1 | though not most obvious to the casual observer. I
    agree with your editor that i the political enthusiasm could be I much
    better than it is. It is a j national shame that we, the gen-. I eyation who
    are about to "inherit j j the world" cannot even bother to take part in our
    national elections, j But even though large masses of Bucknell students are
    not work ing on politics, the mjoritv of j those in the Democrat camp are I
    working in one way or another. | Our group may not be large, but j most of
    us are working hard for a cause which we feel deserves dut help. Several
    faculty members may be serving as advisors and the cen- er of our
    information and ad- | ninistrative set-up, but by anc large, at least within
    the Demo- j 'ratic ranks, the students are tak- ag the initiative and are

    Dear Editor: Business is good in America to day as it has always been. Yet
    there is lacking that old spark, that old ingenuity which used to make
    fortunes overnight. However, one should not lose confidence, because there
    are ex citing opportunities still left for the unscrupulous, ambitious young
    man of today in this great land of ours. Various businesses offer almost
    unlimited chances for public exploitation and profit making. Take, for
    example, the operation of a college book store. At first look, the prospects
    aren't especially attractive, but under the right supervision, an extreme ly
    lucrative practice could be es tablished. Location of Book Store Here is how
    one should go about it. Locate your book store at a rural university that is
    re moved from any commercial cen ter. The reason for this is that near a
    metropolis, other sources j are available for the student to buy his books
    and he might not pay your pripes. It is imperative that yours be the only
    outlet so | that your prices can be as high as i you want. Student Co-
    Operative You might also object that com petition with a student co-opera
    tive that buys and sells books from year to year at cost would ruin your
    business. The student j cp-operative, which exists on many of our larger
    campuses, is a very dangerous threat and must j be exterminated at any
    price. A very neat and subtle way to do j this is to renew negotiations with
    the faculty and arrange it so that different textbooks be required j each
    successive year. The lower !case student co-operative, in this | case, will
    be impossible to main- ! tain since its stocks will become i obsolete from
    year to year. Stockpile Old Books Another advantage to be gain- i ed by this
    system is to stockpile | all old books bought back from ! students at the
    end of their terms j (at a minimum price, of course), j and in three or four
    years redis- I tribute these old books at almost ] original price. For
    example, con sider a book wholesaling at $5. 'You charge the student, say,
    $8.50, i profiting $3.50 in the initial trans- j action. You buy back said
    book for, say, $2.50 (maintaining it is obsolete), and redistribute it years
    later for, say, $5, profiting $2.50 !in the secondary transaction. I
    Multiplying this gain on one book by a thousand would make any normal
    businessman's mouth water. Importance of Name Don't call concern, say,
    "Smith's ! Book Store," but rather name it something like "The University
    Book Store," thus creating the impression that it is run by the
    administration and therefore is I above all reproach. A kickback might be
    necessary here tpo but as they say, " You gotta pay your way." Here, then,
    is your hypothetical business. The beauty of it is that no salesmanship is
    necessary --your clientele come to you. And what a clientele--wealthy
    children who have no regard for cost or worth but merely send their bills
    home. Competition is negligible and no worry about bankruptcy--you exist as
    long as the University exists. Mike Ingraham

Heading: A FRAT TO REMEMBER
Content: Every year, as we all know, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Collegiate
    Fraternities awards a highly coveted prise to the fraternity house which, in
    its judgment, has done the most to promote and enhance the fraternity way of
    life. The prize this year--eight hundred pounds of white putty--goes to the
    Signa Phi Nothing chapter of the South Dakota College of Dentistry and
    Renaissance Art. The award this year is exceptionally richly deserved, for
    the Signa Phi Nothing house is the very model of all a fraternity should be.
    It is, first of all, a most attractive house physically. The outside walls
    are tastefully covered with sequins. Running along the upper story is a
    widow's walk, with a widow stationed every three feet. Moored to the chimney
    pot is the Graf Zeppelin. Indoors, the house gives an impression of simple,
    casual charm. The chapter room is furnished in homey maple and chintz, with
    a dash of verve provided by a carp pool three hundred feet in diameter. A
    waterspout rises from the center of the pool with the housemother bouncing
    on the top. Members' rooms are gracious and airy and are provided with beds
    which disappear into the wall--permanently. Each room also has a desk, a
    comfortable chair, a good reading lamp, and a catapult for skeetshooting.
    Kidney-shaped desks are avail able for kidney-shaped members. Perhaps the
    most fetching feature of the house are the packs of Marlboros stacked in
    heaps wherever one goes. If one wishes to settle back and enjoy a full-
    flavored smoke, one needs only to reach out one's hand in any direction and
    pick a pack of Marlboros--soft pack or flip-top box--and make one's self com
    fortable with a filtered cigarette with an unfiltered taste--that triumph of
    the tobacconist's art, that paragon of smokes, that acme of cigarettes, that
    employer of mine--Marlboro!

Content: The decor, the grace, the Marlboros, all combine to make Signa Phi Nothing a
    real gas of a fraternity. But a fraternity is more than things; it is also
    people. And it is in the people department that Signa Phi Nothing really
    shines. Signa Phi Nothing has among its, members the biggest BMOCs on the
    entire campus of the South Dakota College of Dentistry and Renaissance Art.
    There is, for instance, WUliam Makepeace Sigafoos, charcoal and bun chairman
    of the annual Stamp Club outing. Then there is Dun Rovin, winner of last
    year's All-South Dakota State Monopoly Championship, 1S6 Pound Class. Then
    there is Rock Schwartz, who can sleep stand ing up. Then there is Tremblant
    Placebo, who can crack pecans in his armpits. Then there is Ralph Tungsten,
    who went bald at eight. But why go on? You can see what a splendid bunch of
    chape there is in Signa Phi Nothing, and when one sees them at the house in
    the cool of the evening, all busy with their tasks-- some picking locks,
    some playing Jacks-or-Better, some clipping Playboy--one's heart fills up
    and one's eyes grow misty, and one cannot but give three cheers and a tiger
    for Signa Phi Notiiing, fraternity of the year! O  I960 Max Shulmaa And

Heading: The Sidelines
Content: by Sieve Skinner *+ Turk Does It Again When a quarterback makes the All-East
    team for an outstanding performance on a single Saturday, he is usually
    regarded as a good football player, who had a good afteroon. But when that
    quarter back makes the All-East team two weeks in a row, that's news. Paul
    Terhes is news. After two seasons as the MAC'S top QB, Turk is finally
    getting some proper recognition for the tremendous job he has done for
    Bucknell. Turk was not only selected as the outstanding quarterback in the
    East, but the Philadelphia sports writers are going to honor him Monday, in
    Philadelphia, with the Maxwell Award, given to the outstanding player in the
    area. A Harrisburg newspaper is going to run a full page feature on Turk,
    including the story of his life around Bucknell. Paul Terhes is earning a
    much deserved name for himself and for Bucknell. The School of Hard Knocks
    Much of the bone jarring defense that almost beat Rutgers be came apparent
    for Bison fans in the first three minutes of the game. There were three
    fumbles, and in one series of plays Lafayette was thrown for a loss three
    times before they were forced to punt.

Heading: A
Content: charging Bucknell lineman got a football in the teeth, but blocked a quick-kick,
    which set up a Bucknell touchdown. Tom Alexander, who has developed picking
    up loose footballs into an art, was forced to leave the game in the second
    quarter because he was plain old tired. Alexander has been under the weather
    since before the Rut gers scrap and had been taking shots all week. Ron "The
    Toe" Maslanik Ron Maslanik has been called upon twice in two years to try
    for three points. Each time he has responded and is now two for two in field
    goals attempted. Both times he kicked them there were better than 10,000
    people in the stands. Inspiration? The Bisons seem to do their best work
    before large home crowds. Before 18,000 fans in two home contests they have
    decimated the opposition 69-0. Last year, before a combined audience of
    16,000 they pulled two of the biggest upsets in small college football. Also
    among the kicking oddities was the first onside kick seen at Bucknell for
    some time. With only seconds remaining in the first half, Doug Wiliams
    fell,on a ball that went the required ten yards. Lehigh Will Be Tough When
    Lafayette came to town they sported a 3-0 record and a tie for the Middle
    Atlantic Conference lead. It was a frustrated and dispirited ball club that
    went away with a profound respect for the explosive offense of the Bisons,
    the hard-hitting defense, and the wonderful arm of Paul Terhes. This
    Saturday, a better football team will take the field against Bucknell and
    each of the three components mentioned above will be hard pressed to beat
    Lehigh. The Engineers are a tough, experienced team, with a hefty line, Last
    weekend they lost to Rutgers 8-0, but you caji't compare scores when you're
    talking about these three teams. 'Lehigh had a chance to at least tie the
    game when they pushed down to the Rutgers's six. Their quarter back rolled
    out to his right and had nothing but daylight in front of him, but elected
    to pass. The pass was intercepted in the end zone and that was the ball
    game. Bucknell is going to have its hands full tomorrow afternoon in what
    should be the best game of the season for the home fans. , Easy Money If you
    would like to make an easy three hundred dollars, there is a contest going
    around school right now which offers that amount as first prize. All you
    have to do is predict the Temple-Bucknell score. The details of the contest
    have been listed in the sports sec tion of previous issues, and there
    several posters around school for anyone's edification. Attention: Wrestlers

Content: In routing Gettysburg 9-1 last Friday, the Bucknell soccer team set a new school
    scoring record for one game. As the case has been in the last two weeks, the
    Bisons missed many easy oppor tunities to score which would have placed the
    score in the realm of the impossible. The first goal was the hardest for the
    Bisons. Gettysburg moved the ball very well in Bucknell territory for the
    first seven min utes. When the Bison's backfield finally dug the ball out,
    it was just a matter of time before the Bison's scored. After missing five
    or six shots, Dave Boger heeled a comer kick past the Bullet's goalie. Bill
    Dahl added another one a few minutes later when he scored on a cross from
    Bob Wad- hams. Just before the quarter ended, Frank Famariss found the nets
    on a cross from Lyman Ott. The Bisons kept the pressure on, and Bob Schad
    scored one of the prettiest goals of the season. Bill Dahl headed a ball
    from the wing, and Bob kicked the ball just before it hit the ground into
    the upper right-hand comer. Bill Dahl banked one in off a full back's legs
    to register his second goal of the afternoon. Lyman Ott ended the Bison
    scoring in the third period on a hard shot from 15 yards out. The Bullets
    finally got into the scoring column with a shot from five yards out. Bill
    Dahl got the "hat trick" with five minutes gone in the final period to put
    the Bisons ahead 8-1. Gettysburg scored again on a mixup in the Bison
    backfield. The final score of the game came when Lyman Ott cut through the
    center to take a free kick from Frank Famariss. The Bisons meet Delaware
    this [ Friday, and then they meet Le-

Content: by John Minsker Before 10,000 delighted Home coming onlookers, the Bucknell
    football machine rolled to their third win of the season over the hapless
    Leopards of Lafayette College by a score of 28-0. Lafayette, who came into
    the game leading the Middle Atlantic Conference with a 3-0 rec'ord, left
    with nothing but bruises and a lot of hard feelings, as coach Bob Odell's
    forces held the much vaunted Leopard offense to a mere 96 yards gained,
    while the Bisons racked up 415. The visi tors tallied only four first downs
    all afternoon against 20 forBU and didn't rack up a single one in the first
    half. On one series of downs the Bucknell defense threw the Leopard backs
    for three consecu tive losses before they kicked on fourth down.' Charlie
    Bartos, La fayette halfback, who went into the game leading the MAC in
    rushing and total offense, was held to a scanty 16 yards on ten rushing
    attempts. Terhes Sets Record Bucknell's incomparable quar terback, Turk
    Terhes, completely overshadowed his rival opponent, as he racked up 173
    yards on 47 yards rushing and 9 out of 13 passes for 126 more. Early in the
    third quarter, pitching Paul hurl ed an 18 yard pass to Ash Ditka to run his
    three year total offense mark to 2762 yards, a new Buck nell University
    record. The old record of 2753 was set by Brad Myers in 1951. The outset was
    marked by a I series of fumbles and pass inter- | ceptions in which the ball
    ex- ! changed hands five times in the !first five minutes of play. The !
    Bisons began their first scoring | jaunt early in the second period, i Dean
    Stump blocked a Lafayette j quick kick attempt and the Herd | recovered on
    the visitors 44 yard I stripe. After a first down by Ash I Ditka on the 28,
    Terhes swept left I end to the 12 yard line. Four plays later, captain
    Mickey Mel- | berger, caught a pitchout at his I ankles and scampered into
    the | end zone for the touchdown. Ron I Maslanik's conversion gave the |
    Bisons a 7-0 lead. Terhes and Company got the I ball again on their own 23

    1 off, Paul threw first down passes I to Melberger, Maslanik and Dick j

    the game wide open early in the third quar ter with two quick touchdowns.
    Mickey Melberger intercepted a Leopard pass in the fourth play of the

Heading: Game With Lehigh
Content: 

Heading: |
Content: by Ted Odenwald The Bisons are ih for a rough game with the Engineers of Le- |
    high when they meet this Satur- j day. The Engineers, led by full- i back
    Boyd Taylor and halfback , A1 Richmond, are hungry for v ie -! tory after
    receiving consecutive shutout defeats at the hands of Rutgers and Tufts. In
    their first three games, Le- j high rolled over Delaware, 27-14; j Colgate,
    39-22; and Gettysburg, ! 52-21. In 45 plays from scrim- i mage, quarterback
    John Highfield directed his squad for an offensive j yardage total of 306
    yards, an average of 6.8 yards per play. 1 Taylor, a junior fullback, and P
    at' Clark, a sophomore halfback, led j the team in scoring with 30 and: 28
    points respectively. Richmond led the team in rushing with 140 in 31
    attempts for a 4.5 average.1 Highfield completed 12 of 25; passes for 252
    yards. Jim Need- ! ham was Highfield's top receiver, hauling in seven
    aerials for 203 yards. In the games with Tufts # and Rutgers, the Engineers
    couldn't seem to get their offense rolling. Tufts held the Engineers to 63
    rushing yards and 52 passing yards while Rutgers allowed only 39 on the
    ground and 106 by the air. Plenty of Line Depth With 11 starting lettermen
    on the line, the Engineers have a tough, competent forward wall. Two senior
    lettermen, Ed Murphy and John Van Deusen, are used as both offensive and
    defensive centers. Lehigh boasts fine talent at the guard position since
    they have four lettermen alternating the positions. Doug Edwards and Joe
    Posillico were the starting guards last season while Dick Parsons and Frank
    Buckworth were standouts in the defensive tackle slot. Junior lettermen Reed
    Bohovich and Mike Sem- cheski are considered by many to be the best pair of
    starting tackles in the Middle Atlantic Confer ence. Captain Bill Jones,
    Carl Schwenker, and Jim Needham are the alternating ends for the Engineers.
    With the loss of second string quarterback Walt King, Lehigh must count
    heavily on Highfield. George Theiss and Bob Scheu are Highfield's
    replacements, but they have seen very little action. At the halfback slots,
    Richmond and Clark are aided by senior let termen John Larimer and Chuck
    Lull, and sophomore Ed Winches ter. Last season, Lull was the Engineer's
    number two ground gainer in total offense. He gain ed 287 yards rushing, on
    83 at tempts, and gained 43 yards on pass receptions. Boyd Taylor, a junior,
    has the fullback position sewn up. Last season, he led the Engineers in
    total offense as he gained 339 yards rushing in 106 attempts. Sophomore Andy
    Larko and let- terman Charlie Wentz will share the number two spot. The
    Engineers defense has put on some fine exhibitions. In five games, they have
    given up 760 rushing yards for a 52 yards-per- game average. They have allow
    ed 366 passing yards for a 73- yards-per-game average. Lehigh hasn't faced
    anything like the Bison's Turk Terhes. Having completed 54 of 93 passes,
    Terhes has accounted for 726 of Bucknell's total yardage. Only Gettysburg
    a'nd Colgate presented anything similar to a passing at- (Continued from

Heading: THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.
Content: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28, i960. by David Baird To what point has the campaign
    progressed? Both candidates have made many speeches, have been seen by
    enormous crowds, and have traveled extensivley. Both Senator Kennedy and
    Vice Presi dent Nixon have campaigned vig orously in their pursuit of votes.
    In the process, the American pub lic has become quite familiar with Quemoy
    and Matsu, Cuba, and the concern about the prestige of the United States.
    The resulting gain in public knowledge is ques tionable. There is no denying
    that Que moy and Matsu and similar prob lems are important to the well being
    of the United States. It must also be realized that these are problems that
    would affect the entire world and not just the electorate of the United
    States. One wonders whether or not the public should not be more in terested
    in more practical issues, especially the domestic affairs of our country. It
    is this broad as pect of affairs which will decide if the United States is
    going to be able to maintain its prestige and world power. It is the do
    mestic sector which should decide which candidate is to determine and to
    initiate the programs which would increase our eco nomic growth. Major
    Issues Arguable A marked lack of emphasis has been placed on this area by
    both candidates. They have both been guilty of making major issues out of
    lesser points which were inter jected into the campaign. They would rather
    be seen on television where they can be asked probing and embarassing
    questions by re porters. The end result has been a quibbling and an
    emotional ef fect. This seems to be the effect that the American public
    enjoys as they meet the personalities who are running for President of the
    United States. Should not we, the public, de mand a greater exploration of
    the basic campaign issues? Certain ly Vice President Nixon has writ ten
    several purpose papers, but how many people on campus and in the country
    have had one of these papers to read? Senator Kennedy has suggested that the
    United States has not been pro gressing adequately in economic growth and
    has suggested ways to stimulate growth, but has he come out and told the
    public how it is to pay for this growth? Stress on Domestic Subjects There
    seems to be an elusive ness in consideration of some campaign issues which
    will ulti mately affect the American public (Continued on Page 8) by Lynne
    Coffin The reactions of our press to the just-completed series of TV iebates
    between Kennedy and Nixon have been generally con sistent in their
    appraisals of po litical methodology. In the tradition of the "snake- oil
    salesman," Nixon has continu ously resorted to the emotional appeal over the
    factual presenta tion Of issues. Ranging from his "I know what it is to be
    poor" of the first debate to his emotional conclusion of the last debate,
    Nixon has shown his reliance on emotion instead of fact. Emotional Appeal
    This style of approach is not a new one for Mr. Nixon. As far back as his
    congressional cam paigning, he used the emotional appeal of labeling his
    opponents as "fellow travelers" with "Com munists" to his advantage.By dis
    torting the voting record of Mrs. Helen Douglas, he ruined her po litically.
    He compared her vot ing record on fairly routine mat ters with that of the
    Communist party-liner Vito Marcantonio of New York and inferred from this
    that she was a communist sym pathizer. In September of that year, the
    Independent Review, followed then by many other newspapers, charged Nixon
    with trying to defame Mrs. Douglas by "falsely accusing her through in
    famous insinuation and whispered innuendo of being a Communist." He used the
    same method quite effectively against Congressman Voorhis. (For more
    information on this, read Costello's The Facts About Nixon). Clever
    Campaigning Throughout his campaigning, the clever use of language helped
    him to make fraudulent insinua tions without being specific enough to be
    charged with libel. In the campaign of 1952, an other form of his emotional
    ap peal was shown. Accused and proven to have accepted funds from some
    wealthy California businessmen, Nixon responded with his now famous
    "Checkers speech." Is this honest and thoughtful campaigning? And now, as
    the Washington Post and Times Herald stated on Saturday, October 15, 1960 in
    an editorial: Mr. Nixon also was moxe than a little mean in persistently dis
    torting Mr. Kennedy's position. It almost appeared as if his ad visors had
    coached him to get in and fight for blood. Inevit ably the simple black-and-
    white answers he gave to ques tions about complicated situa- ___ (Continued

    was a Val- entini Sonata in five movements. This is a classical sonata and
    in cludes a brilliant cadenza. In both this and the preceding work, Miss
    Mukle had some trouble with pitches. Particularly those in the very high
    registers were not always true. However, the cellist's technical facility
    shone in the Valentini. In the British fashion,. Miss Mukle had various
    comments to make before and after each num ber. Her dry sense of humor did
    much to dissolve the usually formal nature of such a program, j A complete
    change in mood was | brought on by the third selection, j a Edward Elgar'
    Concerto. This j was by far the best played of j these first three numbers,

    composers--experts cannot decide. The unpublished work is I a beautifully
    simple melody to j which the cellist had composed j an accompaniment. Ernest

    still far less expensive than flying-, and much more fun. The food and

    tourists, even ordinary, and there are things to now> ^  October--probably
    due to do every minute of your trip. We docked at Le Havre about dawn on
    Monday, Oct. 3, and spent two hours in port unloading. It is in teresting to
    note that while the color of the ocean is a deep blue, the English Channel
    is a light greenish color. Unfortunately, passengers for England cannot
    disembark--even for a few hours --at Le Havre, so a column on France will
    have to wait a few more issues! We docked at Southhampton that afternoon,
    after a mild cross ing, and from there I took the train-boat to London.
    Customs is nothing, and even though the train-boats here were about 30 years
    old, the entire trip was very pleasant. London Tour The very next day I took
    a tour of London, and spent the en tire day wandering about trying to
    compare * London with New York. It is impossible--this city is so vast and
    so marvelous that it must stand completely in its own light, rather than
    suffer by any comparison to the United States. The first thing you no tice

    not used to this, cross ing a street becomes a difficult and dangerous
    process. Cars in London do not use their road lights, either; these are used

Content: (Continued from Page 7) from the Duke of York's theatre, on St. Martin's Lane,
    where I had the pleasure of seeing Noel Coward's new and enchanting play,
    "Waiting In the Wings." This warm, wonderful, and very charming play has a
    cast headed by Dame Sybil Thorndike, and I predict it will be a smash
    success when (and if) it goes to Broad way. St. Martin's Lane is the London
    theater area, but it's much more conservative than the areas west of
    Broadway in New York, where our theaters are. During intermission/ although
    there's a bar and restaurant right in the theater, I went to a little Pub
    across the street called the Trafalgar, and enjoyed some dark, warm brown
    Ale, almost sweet, and thoroughly delicious. You buy your program in the
    London i theater, but the best tickets are so inexpensive, that it's
    certainly not asking much. At the end of i every performance in England, be
    it on film or on stage, the orches tra or a recording plays "G od ! Save The
    Queen" and the audi- j ence stands and sings. After theater, which starts at
    7:30, I went to Simpson's for din ner. Simpson's is where you re serve your
    cut of meat, and n o t, your table--and well worth it, too. Tomorrow it's

    population of Bucknell make known its preference. Approxi mately 30% of the
    student body cast ballots on Nov. 1, giving Vice President Nixon 477 votes,
    while his opponent, Senator John F. Kennedy, received 237. Not enough
    members of either the ad ministration or the faculty voted, to make it
    possible to legitimate ly generalize about trends in either area. The
    breakdown, according to classes, was as follows: freshmen I  for Kennedy;

    voted differently from their family. On the other side, only 23, out of 477,
    crossed the line from Democrat to Republi can. This is perhaps the most
    significant discovery made by the mock election. Discussions fol lowing the
    publication of the re sults showed that no one was much surprised by the
    outcome in any way other than its close ness; Nixon had been expected to win
    by a greater majority. Was it the crossing of party lines sophomores--61 for

Heading: Our Challenge
Content: Plans are already underway for a February conference that will build on creative
    student thinking about world affairs. To be known as the Challenge, the
    discussion series will replace the Newsmen's Conference, which in former
    years has been little more than a stale repetition of newspaper debate. The
    Challenge will, instead, strike out for new partici pants from various
    professions and economic viewpoints, including noted scholars, politicians
    and newsmen. Two days of concentrated lecture and debate will provide the
    opportunity for well-informed students to engage in con structive inquiry on
    issues such as socialized medicine, public health insurance, American
    foreign aid and partici pation of labor in management. Although relatively
    isolated from the nail-biting devel opments of the American economic scene,
    we are fortu nate in being able to follow these events in the New York
    Times. The opportunity of interrogating these men who make and record this
    news is, however, a windfall for the inquisitive student. First-hand answers
    to questions on the economic and political philosophies, soon to confront us
    in our jobs and communities, are seldom within such easy reach of the
    ordinary citizen. In preparation for this conference, a "brains trust" of
    eight professors and eight students met to discuss a pos sible theme early
    last month. Among the professors pres ent were Dr. William B. Gwyn, Prof.
    Kenneth J. Roth- well, Dr. James A. Gathings, Dr. Ralph Spielman, Dr. Robert
    Butts, Prof. Douglas E. Sturm, Prof. Philip M. Withim, and Dr. Douglas K.
    Candland. We cannot overlook the fact that some of the most bril liant minds
    on Bucknell's teaching staff have displayed an interest in the Challenge and
    its potential stimulation of critical thinking among students here. In
    future months, a committee, under the chairmanship of Marsha O'Bannon, will
    weave together the tenuous strings of theme, discussion topics, and public
    relations, necessary for the importation of scholars, newsmen and philoso
    phers to a college campus. Periodic publicity will inform the campus of
    progressive developments. The point we wish to make is that the Challenge is
    an exciting program rapidly expanding in scope and involv ing us with a
    concrete world. It is with anticipation that this staff looks forward to
    February 23 and 24 when stu dents, armed with questions and ideas* will
    cross-examine outstanding politicians and labor leaders. In undertaking such
    a conference, we have shown our selves concerned with Bucknell's "dedication
    to the cause of free and responsible inquiry and to the seeking of the truth
    wherever it may be found." It would seem that the progenitors of the
    Challenge have dedicated a remarkably functional turnpike leading to our
    destination.

Heading: Plan Ahea
Content: In today's complex society the common trend is toward long-range planning.
    Modern technology, the increasing impersonality of social contact, and the
    shrinkage of the globe by means of advancements in transportation and
    communication have necessitated this far-sighted plan ning in order to
    insure the efficient functioning of society. But then there is our own dear
    University, who, in her efforts to combat conformity, has reverted to the
    idea of formulating short-term plans. It seems like only last spring that
    coeds began using the newly completed stair way leading to Tustin Gym. And
    now this same stairway is being removed. There is a new wing (undreamed of
    last spring, of course!) being added to the gym, and these steps are now in
    the way. The grass in the academic quad in front of the library was so nice
    and green (after it finally grew high enough to cover the scars left by the
    construction of Coleman Hall), and then someone decided that trees might
    enhance the area. So the grass was uprooted. The turf barely had time to
    recover before someone realized that a water main had to be laid between
    Coleman Hall and the new Administration Center. Since the workmen couldn't
    quite burrow from one building to the other, the grass "got the ax" again.
    Oh, yes! You must have noticed by now the face-lift ing job recently done on
    Bucknell's highway system. The most noticeable of these additions and
    corrections is prob ably the disappearance of the roadway from Vaughan
    Literature Building to Davis Gym. It seems that the plan ning program calls
    for a circuitous route between these two points. The highway system has now
    been rounded out, at least temporarily, by that splendid boulevard, lov
    ingly known as Geiger's Super Highway, which cuts straight across campus in
    a most essential direction. All is not lost, however, because the
    considerate plan ners have provided sidewalks to complement the highway
    system. Of course the cross-walk at the Vaughan Liter ature Building isn't
    situated just right, and everyone cuts across the grass (intended grass,
    that is). But this is a small matter, and wholly in tune with the present
    plan ning program. These energetic planners certainly do deserve a vote of
    confidence. How'else could the University be consistent in its physical
    improvement program and still avoid con forming to the long-range trend now
    being adopted else where in the United States? I've been philosophizing
    about Dr. Tillich's creative thinking this weekend j heard the most
    fascinating songs every night a bunch of "men" came by the "sem" singing
    lovely serenades friday nite in the library (study nite at bu) a charming,
    melodic group entertained us with "music to study by" i saw a sign on one
    horn saying Beer and Pretzel corps strange name for a wandering minstrel
    group which was sadly broken up by a pa system playing Johnny Mathas with
    choruses by the SIGS-- not to let us study in the boredom of a quiet
    library, the lewisburg band broke into stirring songs and cheers for our
    ears alone with lovelies marching through the campus from a contest in the
    stadium then after a dull five minutes crawling down the hill came more
    creative listening to the bu phenomenon of 1230--the hom-honking sonata with
    a coda rendered by the giggling of "sem-gems" then the moving notes of that
    campus classic "Hail to old Lambda Chi" by a group of men straight from a "
    dry" open house here we have what Tillich never knew the opportunities for
    "creative listening" the aesthetic experience possible when listening to the
    local talent is unparalleled hoping you can enrich your life this weekend as

Heading: AS MEMORIES FOND COME TROOPING BY
Content: by Jane Tilton Lewisburg 1891 The football record at Bucknell this year is one
    that we of Lew isburg feel obligated to comment. In spite of the fact that
    Bucknell is still considered one of the smaller eastern colleges, they have
    man aged to produce a team that was able to beat Lafayette 16 to 10, State
    College 12 to 10, and Cornell University 4 to 0. These triumphs are to the
    credit of the team. They have been forced to play their games under every
    possible disadvantage. Being without a coach, as well as sufficient time in
    which to practice, the men seem to win by pure determination. For instance
    it has been reported by one member of the Cornell football team that
    Bucknell has but one signal: "One, two, three--give me the ball." Yet
    Bucknell football has certainly come a long way from its meager beginning in
    a game with Lafayette only eight years ago. Never having played football
    before, the team was literally forced to learn the gameas it played it. The
    original team consisted of but 11 men and one substitute. The game was
    played with little previ ous practice; as a matter of fact, no member of
    that first team had ever even seen a football game, no less played in one.
    The final score: Lafayette 59, Bucknell 0. Congratulations to the Bucknell
    football team. We comment on your past and look hopefully to your future.
    "Flattery is like perfume. The idea is to smell it, not swallaw it,"

Heading: THE EDITOR
Content: Dear Bucknellians, In a very short time this year's Religion-in-Life Program
    will be at hand. (Nov. 13-16 and Nov. 20). I am writing this letter in order
    to acquaint you with the theme for this year's program and to give you some
    necessary in formation. After studying for four years at Bucknell, what will
    our college education mean to us? Will it simply be a degree for degree's
    sake, or will our degree symbolize a much greater and more mean ingful
    educational experience? How can our campus activities in classrooms, in
    fraternities and sororities, and in campus organiz ations contribute to our
    educa tional experience? These are just some of the questions that have come
    up while we were discuss ing our theme for this year's pro gram, The Idea of
    the University. Last week we read an editorial in this newspaper pointing
    out the basic differences and confus ions apparent between the idea of the
    "old Bucknell" and the "new Bucknell". We feel that our Re ligion-in-Life
    Program this year offers a great opportunity to everyone--faculty, students,
    and administration--to see if Bucknell is really where we want it to be or
    to investigate roads of further improvement and clarification. Our program
    this year will of fer the opportunity for student - faculty discussions
    about our edu cation. We have three excellent leaders coming in to present
    their views on this very topic-- The Idea of the University. These three
    leaders are: Dr. Harold Taylor, Dr. Victor Yanitelli, and Dr. Shubert Ogden.
    We have planned to have an " all Bucknell" panel one evening made up of
    professors and stu dents who will attempt to see how the Idea of the
    University relates to our problems here fit Bucknell. Dr. Sturm of the
    Religion depart ment has prepared an excellent syllabus entitled The Idea of
    the University. In this issue of the Bucknellian you will see various
    articles about our coming program. I would like to urge you to read these,
    to acquire a copy of the syllabus, and above all to participate in the
    program with enthusiasm and in telligence. I think this program has a great
    deal to offer to the campus; we must participate to get its full meaning and
    message. Jim De Laney RIL Chairman * * * Just a. few thoughts from the Pilt
    News: "The trouble with getting home work done in time is not in find ing
    the time to study, but in studying during the time found." "A coincidence is
    when a person taking a long-cut meets the very person he was trying to
    avoid." "In telling a person a supposedly spontaneous joke, the only ex
    perience that is more embarrassing than discovering, half-way through the
    joke, that you've already told it to him before, is to re call suddenly,
    half-way through such a story, that it was from your very listener that you
    stole it."

    under the Act of March 3, 1379. Editor: Several weeks ago one of the
    fraternities on our campus receiv ed a visit from a representative of' its
    national organization. This man came from a considerable distance to present
    the highest award which it was within the power of his fraternity to give a
    local chapter -- The Superior Chapter Award. The award was based upon five
    criteria: adminis tration, chapter relations, mem bership, scholarship, and
    alumni relations. In presenting the trophy the spokesman described the
    purposes of the national or ganization and indicated that the Bucknell
    chapter had been in close contention for the award ever since it had first
    been offer ed. This kind of recognition is an honor not only to the
    individual fraternity, but to Bucknell as well. On behalf of the Univer sity
    I would like to congratulate George Coogan, and the brothers of the

    Dr. Cyrus Karraker, a teacher of history at Bucknell University in
    Pennsylvania, heard about the conditions of migrants in Potter county, he
    went himself for a first-hand look. Jolted by what he saw, Dr. Karraker
    called a campus meeting to tell'his stu dents and fellow professors about
    his findings. The result was the formation of the- Pennsylvania Citizens
    Committee on Migratory Labor. A neighbor of Karraker's. Mrs. Lois Garnvin,
    became execu tive secretary of the group. Since then the organization has
    helped activate an official state agency to concern itself with migrant prob
    lems. Karraker's students got to work too. By organizing bake sales and
    other fund raising ven tures, several girls' dormitories collected enough
    money to pro vide college scholarships for de serving migrant children. The
    work of these people has set off a chain reaction which has made
    Pennsylvania one of the more ad vanced states for easing the mi grant

Content: 

Heading: AND CURE
Content: With the season of party weekends almost upon us, my mail of late has been
    flooded with queries from young inmates of women's colleges wishing to know
    how one conducts one's self when one has invited a young gentleman for a
    weekend, so let us today take up this burning issue. Well, my dear girls,
    the first thing to remember is that your young gentleman is far from home
    and frighteried. Put him at his ease. You might, for instance, surprise him
    by having his mother sitting in a rocker on the station platform when he
    gets off the train. Next, what kind of corsage should you send your young
    gentle man? Well, my beloved maidens, orchids are always acceptable. So,
    indeed, are phlox and delphinium. In fact, most any flora will serve. Do
    try, however, to avoid carnivorous plants. If you find, my esteemed fillies,
    that your local florist has run out of stock, do not be dismayed. Make a
    corsage out of paper. But pick good, stiff, durable paper--twenty dollar
    bills, for example. Remember at all times, my fond wenches, to show your
    young gentleman courtesy and consideration. Open doors for him, walk on the
    traffic side of the path, assist him to the punch bowl, zip his parka, light
    his Marlboros. (What, you ask, if he doesn't smoke Marlboros? Ridiculous, my
    precious nymphs! Of course, he smokes Marlboros! Don't you? Don't I? Doesn't
    everybody who knows a hawk from a handsaw? What other cigarette gives you
    such a lot to like? Such easy-drawing filtration? Such unfiltered taste?
    Such soft pack or flip-top box? No other, my sweet minxes, no other.
    Marlboro stands alone, and any man worthy of you, my estimable damsels, is
    bound to be a Marlboro man.)

Content: If \\\ If you will follow the simple instructions stated above, my good lasses,
    you will find that you have turned your young gentleman into a fast and
    fervent admirer. There is nothing quite like a party weekend to promote
    romance. I am in mind of a party weekend some years ago at Miss Pomfritt's
    Seminary for well-born females in West Linotype, Ohio. Serafina Sigafoos, a
    sophomore at this institution, majoring in napkin folding, sent an
    invitation to a young man named Fafnir Valve, a junior at the Joyce Kilmer
    School of Forestry, majoring in sap and boles. Serafina had been ape for
    Fafnir since high school, but Fafnir preferred a girl named Gelia
    Fleshwound, the high school drum majorette who once threw a baton so high
    she impaled a south bound mallard. Anyhow, Serafina sent an invitation to
    Fafnir, and he came, and she showered him with kindness and cuff links, and
    then he went away, and Serafina sat anxiously by the mailbox, wondering
    whether she would ever hear from him again. Sure enough, two weeks later she
    got a letter: " Dear Serafina, Can you let me have fifty bucks? Yours,
    Fafnir." Whimpering with ecstasy, she ran to the bank and withdrew the money
    and mailed it to him. From then on, she got the gamp request every week, and
    as a result, she became very well acquainted with Ralph T. Involute, teller
    of the West Linotype RnnV and Trust Co., and their friendship ripened into
    love, and today they are happily married and live in Stamen, Oregon, where
    Ralph is in the extruded molasses game and Serafina ig a hydrant. * * *

Heading: Bucknell Stops Lehigh, 18-6
Content: 

Heading: A
Content: disappointing turnout by Bucknell football fans last Satur day had little or no
    effect on a fired-up Bison team that defeated the Lehigh Engineers 18-6.
    Only 6000 spectators "crowded" into Memorial Stadium to witness the biggest
    game of the season for the Bucknell squad, which fea tured two touchdowns by
    Ashton Ditka and another first rate per formance turned in by Paul Terhes.
    The Bison defense had little trouble containing the high ly vaunted Lehigh
    running at tack, with the exception of a 56- yard break-through in the last
    quarter which accounted for the Engineer's only score and most of theif
    rushing yardage. Following Ron Maslanik's open- . ing kickoff, Lehigh was
    forced to kick after moving the ball only nine yards. The Bisons could only
    go four yards when they got their hands on the ball and likewise had to
    kick. The second time they took over an Engineer punt, Bucknell moved the
    ball to the Lehigh 36, where a fumble put them back on defense. Another
    exchange of punts made a dull first quarter even duller and it was not until
    about four minutes had gone by in the second period before Bison fans found
    any rea son to cheer. Twiford Stops Drive Lehigh successfully moved the ball
    to Bucknell's 33 yard line be fore being halted. Ken Twiford made a one man
    tackle to stop the drive which had put Bison rooters on the edge of their
    seats. plays later Ashton Ditka scored his second TD of the afternoon.
    Bucknell had marched 66 yards in seven plays. The third quarter jvas prac
    tically a carbon copy of the first. Twelve of the 16 punts in the game were
    in the first and third sessions. Bucknell could hot get the ball into Lehigh
    territory* and the Engineers could go no further than the Bison 43.
    Melberger Converts Bobble At the opening of the final period Bucknell was
    forced to punt from their own 32 yard line. Taking over on their own 48
    line, they were pushed back by Tom j Noteware to their own 40. On j the next
    play from scrimmage I Tom pushed them back to their I own 35, and an
    Engineer pass went for five yards, only to result I in a fumble with
    Noteware re covering the ball. Taking over I on the Lehigh 35, the Bisons
    scor- I ed in seven plays, Mickey Mel berger carrying his own bobble over
    the goal line. For the third time Bucknell was unable to com plete the
    conversion. Following the kickoff by Dick Johnson, Ed Winchester, Lehigh
    right half, moved the ball three yards to his own 44. On the next play, left
    half Pat Clark went around right end for 56 yards and the visitor's only
    score. The Bisons punted following the kickoff and Lehigh tried every I
    desperation pass in the book until they lost the ball with 1:55 re maining.

    Tradition On the west coast when you mention football and brothers in the
    same breath, it's the McKeevers who first come to mind. In the east a new
    tradition in brotherly recognition may have been founded last week when both
    Ashton Ditka, Bucknell's superb halfback, and Mike Ditka All-American choice
    at Pitt were BOTH named to the ECAC All-East football team of the week. Both
    Ditkas were instrumental in important victories scored by their teams.
    Syracuse Upset Syracuse, riding the crest of a 16-game winning streak, and
    num- mer one in the nation last year, fell victim to an inspired Pitt team
    and were soundly beaten 10-0. All season long Syracuse had squeak ed through
    game after game. After shellacking West Virginia two weeks ago, the "Big
    Orange" were again rated as one of the top teams in the country. But
    hardnosed Pitt, which has lost some real heart- breakers this season,
    exacted a terrific punishment upon the New Yorkers. The Lambert Cup Bucknell
    had its eye on the Lambert Cup this year, after soundly thrashing Buffalo
    and Lafayette and losing a thriller to Rutgers 23- 19. A victory over Lehigh
    would put the Bisons in a very favorable spot especially a convincing
    victory. Ash was the key to the con vincing" victory as he scored two of the
    three Bison touchdowns and caught six passes for 68 yards as well as picking
    up 38 yards on the ground. He accounted for over one-third of Bucknell's
    total offense last Saturday. A Triple Threat Both Ditkas are of the mighty
    shoulders, slim hip variety. Na- | tives of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, they
    both starred in football and I basketball at Aliquippa High. Mike is a
    three-sport star at Pitt and I can be best remembered for a memorable
    performance on the base ball diamond at Bucknell last year. Somewhat
    irritated by the jibes of several bench jockeys, big Mike hit one of the
    longest home runs ever seen at Bucknell. ________ __________ When Bucknell

Content: " Stu" Smith graduated from Southern Cal with a powerful yen for excitement. His
    kind of excitement--Engineering. He got what he bargained for (and a little
    more) when he joined Pacific Telephone. One of Stu's early assignments was
    .to find out how existing Long Distance networks could be used to pipeline
    high speed " conversations" between computers in distant cities. The fact
    that he did a fine job did not go unnoticed. Today, four years after
    starting his tele phone career, Senior Engineer Stuart Smith heads a staff
    of people responsible for telegraph and data transmission engineering in the
    huge Los Angeles area. As a pioneer in this new data transmission field Stu
    predicts data processing machines will some day do more Long Distance "
    talking"  than people. Stu contacted 12 other companies before join ing
    Pacific Telephone. " I don't think there's any limit to where a man can go
    in the telephone business today. Of course, this isn t the place for a guy
    looking for a soft touch. A man gets all the opportunity he can handle right

Heading: My World
Content: by Dick Fidler I would like to express my appreciation to you for your more than
    generous response to my article and my requests. When I re turned this
    September I was quite concerned with the problem of finding someone to read
    to me. Thanks to your interest, the problem of finding readers has virtually
    been solved. I now have an ever in creasing list of people who are willing
    to read to me, and as some of them know already, reading to me is not quite
    so hard as some may imagine. They are finding such work not only to be
    helpful to me, but a help to them. I hope that this shall continue to be the
    case, for I like the pro cess of reading to be a two sided affair, where
    both parties benefit. To those of you that are now reading to me, I do not
    think that a mere "thank you" as expressed by these printed words is
    sufficient, but in many cases, words are often lacking in their ability to
    express fully the feelings behind them. Say Hello For those of you who have
    stopped to make my acquaintance I am' grateful. As I said in that first
    article, I would like to meet as many people as possible and to get to know
    them. Fear not, I w ill not, upon you introducing yourself to me, grab you
    and say "Read to me." If you are interested in doing reading, it w ill be
    left up Jo you to say so. My World "My World" is the title under which I
    hope to write, during the course of this coming year, various articles
    telling of my world. It is true that each of us sees the world in a
    different way. But, know ing that to many of you my world would seem quite
    different from that which you know, I hope that the world in which I live
    and the world in which you live may prove to be connected. For is not " my
    world" also your world? One of the questions which I am frequently asked is:
    "How doi you get around." Perhaps one of the reasons why this question is so
    difficult to answer is that I myself do not really think about how I  get
    around. Just as you, day after day, go from here to there and back again
    Without really thinking about each step, so it is with me. ] W e all know
    how to walk, but if asked how to do it, most of us would probably take a
    considerable amount of time in forming a clear informative answer to this
    question. So it is when you ask me how I get around; I must stop and think
    how to answer you as simply and understandably as possible. Just as each of
    you had to learn to walk, I too had to learn some "tricks of the trade" of
    traveling. Many things have become almost second nature now. I might as w
    ell begin with the most obvious of my " tricks," that is, my cane. I took a
    course at Overbrook in the use of a cane for traveling. Naturally as with
    everything else, most of what I know about using a cane has been learned
    through experience. Cane Touch . As you know, the sense of touch is very
    important to me. The cane I carry is actually a means by which I am able to
    feel the ground before me and know, to a greater or lesser degree, what is
    in my path. The cane is, in reality, an extension of my finger. Con trary to
    the general belief of most people, the cane is not used, ex cept in rare
    incidents, to make a tapping noise. It is used to tell the difference
    between the paved walk and the ground or grass along side the walk. Thus I
    use the edge of the] walks as a guide to assist me in my travels. Naturally,
    if I happen to misjudge the edge of the walk, I may find myself on another
    path. Here at Bucknell where there is so many angled paths, it is very easy
    to get off a couple of degrees. . Keeping my general direction is very
    important also. If you were to transport me to some place completely unknown
    to me and just set me down there, I would have to take some pains to find
    out just which way to go. When coming to a new place for the first time, I
    usually have someone walk me to the various places where I am to go. Thus I
    build up in my mind a sort of mental direction picture of where various
    buildings, etc, are located. BESHIR KASSIS by Beshir Kassis On June 14,
    1830, a French ex peditionary force of 37,000 men conquered Algeria after a
    war lasting 17 years. Following the assertion of-French military au thority
    in the occupied territory, steps were taken both in Algeria arid France to
    assimilate and in tegrate the Algerians. But the ] Algerian masses had clung
    des- perately to their Arabic tradition of language and it became ex-1
    tremely difficult to overcome this j strong attachment. The Algerian
    National Move-1 I ment goes back to the few years j before the first World
    War. The presence of the first group of ed ucated Algerians who graduated |
    from different French institutions | advocating the cause of liberty i and
    equality for Algerian people \ was a factor for the national ] movement in
    Algeria. Other factors were the return of 94,000 Algerian soldiers who had
    fought for France in the first World War and the 78,000 Alger ian laborers
    who worked in the French factories helping arma ment productioh. These
    soldiers and workers went back to Algeria demanding the same rights and I do
    have a bit of sight, but this is not always reliable and I do not rely on
    the little that I have. Some days, I am able to distin guish between the
    color of the walk and the grass or ground. But, especially now that fall is
    here, the walks and ground have a ten dency to blend together. I also make
    use of the ability to sense something before me. For example, when- walking
    down a hall, I am able to sense the end of the hall coming and to know
    whether there is a door or wall before | me. On those days when I am relying
    on that bit of sight I do have, this sense is not as acute as it can be.
    Also I do make a lot of use of general sounds. I tell where doors are by
    listening to the chatter of people who are coming in and out. Through your
    conversations many of you have unconsciously helped me to get to some place
    or to know where I am. Surprises j Naturally there are times when I, am
    surprised in the course of | my travels, but I have learned to take them in
    stride and to consider j each surprise as learning something new. For
    example, the other I day I was walking down the hall and right in the middle
    of the hall | was a bench. I did not know the bench was there, but I soon
    found j out that it was. Or, I may learn of a new tree somewhere. But all j
    these little experiences help to make life more interesting. i Just to
    illustrate the fact that I and.the rest of my friends who] are blind can
    learn and sometimes find traveling amusing, I would like j to tell you this
    incident which happened to a friend of mine. T his friend was walking down a
    street in New York. He came j to a street corner which had no street-light.
    If a light were there | he would have listened to the traffic to tell when
    to cross. So he stood j there a moment and then sensed that there was some
    living object] before him. He asked if it was all right to cross, but got no
    reply. He asked several more times, but still with no reply. He finally
    bellow ed out, " Is it all right to cross." The horse that was standing
    before him finally replied with a snort. Until the next article; happy
    traveling. And in your travels, if you happen to run across me, don't forget
    to say hello and if you would like to get to know me, introduce yourself. P
    A G E  SEVEN privileges which the French en joyed. Freedom Demands These
    demands of equality and freedom found no favorable re sponse from the French
    authori ties. After the second World War, the national movement demanded
    that the principles of the Atlantic Charter be extended to Algeria, and the
    result, was the massacre of 45,000 Algerians on May 8, 1945 under fabricated
    demonstra tions. The Algerians are not treated : on the basis of equality
    with the French settlers. The individual Algerian has been left without
    anything to call his own; without a past, without a future. The control of
    local Algerian politics by the Colons (French farmers) minority was a result
    of unequal political opportunity between the Algerian masses and !the
    European settlers. A ll these causes, besides the i fact that the Algerian
    leaders had j been educated in France and | knew just as much about liberty,
    ] equality and fraternity, led to the well known Algerian Revolution j on
    Nov. 1, 1954. That started our i revolution in different parts of the
    country; it moved quickly, so that after one year the National Liberation
    Arm y was formed. In 1954, it had a force of 3000 men; by 1959 it had grown
    to 200,000 troops. National Army "The Algerian National Army is now an
    efficient, disciplined force without a unified command and strategy,"
    according to The Manchester Guardian. A fter 130 years of colonial rule, the
    past five years of struggle have brought about official recognition by
    France of the right of the A l gerian people to self-determina tion. During
    the preliminary talks held at Melun, "France," from June 25-29, the attitude
    of the French government indicated clearly that the conditions and
    modalities of the future meeting between the French and Algerian delegations
    were to be unilateral ly decided by France. In view of France, the talks
    were to be a monologue. The conditions of peace negoti- | ations cannot be
    unilaterally im- ] posed, but must be worked out by | agreement of the two
    parties. (Continued on page 10) 4 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 '  j <<J* 1 T 4-

Content: by Ben Sieiner Kylin Chhor, a Cambodian stu dent currently studying here on a
    State Department Scholarship, was invited to the United Nations by the
    Cambodian delegation. He went to the U. N. as president of the Khmer Student
    Association, an organization of Cambodian students studying in the U. S. A.
    Kylin had the honor of presenting the Prince of Cambodia with a letter from
    the Khmer Student Association asking the Prince to be the Association's
    Honorary President. Meeting With Khrushchev Kylin was part of the receiving
    line at a reception given by the Cambodian Delegation for all the delegates
    of the U. N. Among the many delegates whom Kylin was able to greet was one
    who left a lasting impression upon his mind. The individual was Nikita
    Khrushchev. Although Kylin, who is majoring in political science and
    sociology, would have liked to have interviewed Nikita Khrushchev, he was
    unable to do so because the Premier was sur rounded by newsmen and U. N.
    delegates. Kylin noticed the con trast between Khrushchev's ac tions at the
    reception and in the

Content: At the reception Khrush chev was "a calm, happy, modest, and dignified
    diplomat."  Just two days later, he was pounding his shoe in the General
    Assembly. New Yorkers Annoyed Kylin also observed the general reaction of
    the New Yorkers to this General Assembly. Their annoyance was a result of
    con fusion caused by the excess num ber of police surrounding the U. N.
    building. The taxicab drivers seeemd to voice the geperal feel- | ing of New
    Yorkers when they i told Kylin that they were anxious to see the majority of
    the diplo mats leave. All that the dele gates appeared to be doing was
    blowing off steam in the U. N. and causing great confusion in the city.
    Hammarskjold Another interesting observation which Kylin made concerned the
    Soviet resolution to oust Ham marskjold. H ie American press wrote that the
    defeat of this reso lution was a gain for United States world leadership.
    But Ky lin pointed out that the nations who defeated the Russian move did so
    because of their own feel ings and not because of American influence. Our
    allies, as Kylin believes, are "only those who are bound to us by treaties
    such as NATO and SEAT'D."

    ______________ by David Baird On Thurs., Oct. 27, one of th e! most
    influential papers in the j United States, the New York Times, came out in
    support for j John F. Kennedy for President. In announcing their support,
    the j editorial went on to present weak ! reasons fo r' doing so. The two
    reasons were foreign policy and' the assurance of " a unified direc tion of
    the nation's affairs." The editorial stated that with i the exception of
    their views of ! Quemoy and Matsu the two can -; didates had similar goals
    and | policies in the field of foreign policy. As the decisive factor in
    their choice, the Times mentioned Nixon's statements regarding the offshore
    islands to the effect that "he would not surrender 'one inch of free
    territory' to the Commun ists." What worried the editors of the Times was
    the implication of this statement regardng our foreign policy as a whole.
    They are wor ried about areas comparable to Southeastern Asia, with unstable
    governments which are a likely prey to the expansive Communist Chinese
    government. Power Balance The Times considers this to be a dangerous
    statement which i by Lynne Coffin would over commit the United For those in
    America who Re states in this area. In this same j lieve that our country is

    Teresa lived only in Madrid, Spain before coming to this country, numerous
    summer- vacation trips have given her a vast knowledge of life in all
    ?>>arts of Europe. Among the countries she has visited are France, Switz
    erland, England, Austria and Sweden. Of all these countries, Senorita Tarrio
    finds the United States the most impressive. This is, as she herself puts-
    'it , " because of the of friends. Despite having been to Europe previously
    and having read wide ly, Miss Martin, professor of Eng lish, found her trip
    most fascin ating. "My bus trip (58 days) from France, through southeast ern
    Europe and into India, is one that I shall never forget if I live to be one
    hundred" . Why? Well, for several reasons. First, the bus had 51 blowouts
    and punctures. Secondly, the sleeping accommodations left A few nights were
    spent in the auditor ium and corridors of an Iranian high school, on little
    portable beds. Tent Camping Other nights included sleeping in pup-tents by
    the roadside. One such night was spent on a plateau in Turkey. Upon
    awakening the next morning, Miss Martin dis covered the temperature to be 28
    degrees (in May). In addition to these amusing incidents, Miss Martin saw

    or they are by necessity against us, Mr. Kennedy has shown through his
    speeches that he understands the desire of these emerging nations to remain
    neutral in the cold war. Throughout his congressional career, Senator
    Kennedy has also accumulated a record which is consistently liberal, a
    striking comparison to the first one way and then another approach of his
    opponent. Unlike his opponent who had directed his party's plat form
    formation only to suddenly decide to change it on the eve of the convention
    after early morn ing debates with a more liberal party member, Senator
    Kennedy worked to have a platform which he could wholeheartedly support
    --and win such a platform. Senator Kennedy's courageous efforts to have the
    Loyalty Oath provision of the NDEA repealed seem to be a further indication
    of where he stands on this issue which divides the liberals from the
    conservatives. Furthermore, Mr. Nixon has shown extreme inconsistency in his
    approach to the Connelly amendment, first calling for its repeal then asking
    that it be sub stantially strengthened. This shift from an extremely liberal
    to an extremely conservative position, effected during the short time o f
    this compaign, is a further indica tion of the vice president's lack of true
    and consistent beliefs.

    ting for Halloween, and the per fect night for the Great Pumpkin to strike.
    This year his target was certain fraternity houses. Numerous phone warnings
    had been made previous to this mis chief night. In fact, once a Greek picked
    up the phone even before it rang and was startled by a strange voice
    warning, "Twenty- four hours before the Great Pumpkin strikes!" On that
    fatal night several figures | clad in dark clothes stealthily climbed the
    hill toward their destination. In his first at tack, the Great Pumpkin,
    merely soaped a few windows but was spotted by the headlights of a car and
    fled into the-night. However, the Great Pumpkin was not to be squashed!
    Again he arose to string toilet paper from trees, scatter newspaper
    particles over lawns, soap windows and put toothpaste on doorknobs. This
    time he was not to go un chastised. As the Great Pumpkin fled, he was
    pursued in car and and by foot by vengeful Greeks. Finally apprehended by
    the alert brothers, the' Great Pumpkin was forcibly brought back to the
    scene of the crime, leaving traces of talcum powder and toothpaste on
    various and sundry Greek heads--the mark of the Great Pumpkin. The trial was
    short. Amidst cries of "Human Sacri fice!" the Great Pumpkin met his doom.
    Hosed and pummeled with water bags, the Great Pumpkin was finally returned,
    thoroughly drenched, to his abode in the val ley. 'Twas a dark, dreary
    night, but the spirit of the Great Pump kin was still alive!

    the audi ence's enjoymtent and understand ing of the professor's character.
    Mr. Newton seemed to dominate the whole production, which was partly due to
    the type of play chosen and partly to his consid erable experience in the
    theatre. The director, Grenville Cuyler, was unable to overcome the prob
    lems of theatre-in-the-round. One- third of the audience was ignored
    throughout the play. The char acters seemed to move because they had been
    told to do so, and for no apparent reason except that the time had come for
    the audience to see another part of the actor's face. Mr. Cuyler did produce
    an effective setting, and his choice of costumes was very- good. Production
    of The Lesson as a staged reading did not detract from the overall enjoyment
    of the play. The use of books was not apparent and was skillfully in
    corporated into the action. Stag ed readings are useful because they give
    confidence to young, inexperienced actors--of whom the Actors' Lab is
    comprised, and they also allow for the production of more plays in a shorter
    time.

Heading: In Wee Hours
Content: - by Barry Podber Starting slowly, but picking up momentum with each passing
    hour, Senator John F. Kennedy led the Democratic Party back into* the White
    House after an ab sence of eight years. The vote, as most polls predict ed,
    was extremely close in the j popular column, but in the all important
    electoral-vote area the young Senator swept to a power ful and inspiring
    victory. Kennedy showed that he was able to overcome the so-called re
    ligious issue. He met his oppon ent head-on when the issue of j maturity was
    introduced into the campaign. The Democratic trend ! j started when the
    Democrats won the state of Conn, by a majority I of more than 80,000. j The
    large majorities which | j Senator Kennedy rolled up in the j industrial
    cities of Conn, gave evidence of the sweep of the East j I which Kennedy was
    to make as | | time went on. President-Elect--JOHN F. KENNEDY The second
    eldest of nine chil dren was born to a family with a long tradition of
    public service. His mother's father was mayor of Boston; his father's
    grandfather served in both houses of the Massachuseets legislature, and his
    own father was once Ambassador to Great Britain. A graduate of Harvard
    Univer sity in 1940, he attended the Lon don School of Economics, and did
    graduate work at Stanford Uni versity. During World War II, Senator Kennedy
    commanded a PT boat in the South Pacific. He was dec orated twice by the
    Navy for "his courage, endurance, and excellent leadership" in rescuing
    injured members of his crew. After serving as a congressman from 1946 to
    1952, Kennedy de feated Henry Cabot Lodge to be come Senator from
    Massachusetts by 70,000 votes, despite an other wise Eisenhower - Republican
    sweep in that state. In 1958, he won re-election by the largest margin ever
    accorded a candidate in either party in the history of the state. The
    Senator is a mem ber of the Foreign Relations, the Labor and Public Welfare,
    Joint Economic, and Select Committee to Investigate Improper Activities in
    the Labor and Management Field. A former correspondent for INS and the
    Chicago Herald American, he is the author of many maga zine articles, the
    book, Why Eng land Slept, and the Pulitzer Prize winning, Profiles in
    Courage, and The Strategy of Peace. Senator Kennedy is married to the former
    Jacqueline Lee Bouvier and is the father of Caroline, bom in 1947. The
    Kennedys expect another child in December. Public service is a Kennedy
    family tradition. His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, is the former Ambassador to
    Great Britain and one-time chairman (appointed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt)
    of both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Maritime
    Commission. His mother is the former Rose Fitzgerald, daughter of the late
    John F. Fitz- gerald, mayor of Boston and U. S. Congressman. His grandfather
    j was a member of the Massachu- , setts State House and Senate. Senator
    Kennedy's concern for j world peace has taken him to Russia, Germany, China,
    Israel, Poland, India, Korea, arid 27 other countries in Latin America, the
    I Middle East, Europe, Africa, and Asia. His four years of military service
    and 14 years of Congres sional service have familiarized him with all
    branches of the U. S. I Government.

    the presidential race and in the congressional one. Kennedy still has 241
    electoral votes--Nixon's total has risen to 166. Kennedy is leading for 100
    additional electoral votes, while Nixon has the lead for 22. Ken nedy needs
    but 28 additional elec toral votes to clinch the election --a concession by
    California would do it. In spite of the apparent Demo cratic sweep, national
    chairman Jackson conceded at 2 a. m. that the election is closer than it was
    expected to be. This factor can be explained by the closeness in -the
    popular vote--Nixon ' has 24,209,125 votes and Kennedy has only a slight
    lead with 25,554,930. In the congressman race the Democrats have captured 17
    ad ditional seats in the Senate and 232 in the House, to the Republi cans 9
    Senate seats and 105 House seats. The RCA 501 Computer predicts a final
    total of 188 electoral votes for Nixon and 349 for Kennedy. Nixon will cap
    48.8% of the pop ular vote to Kennedy's 51.2%. 2:15 a. m. Kennedy needs but
    eight elec toral votes to go over the top. The Democrats have won the

    director of the National Youth Adminis- I tration of his home state, Johnson
    was elected to Congress in 1937. i He was a member of the United | States
    Naval Reserve, with the j rank of Commander, on active ! duty in 1941 and
    1942. In 1949 j he was first elected to the Senate, where he has served with
    distinc tion ever since. As minority leader of the 83rd j Congress, and
    majority leader of j the 84th, the Senator has demon- ! strated his
    considerable talents as ah administrator and as a man I who can get things
    done. Senator Johnson's personable wife is a business executive in ; her own
    right, who manages to ; run her Washington establish ment, manage the
    interests of : their Texas ranch, and raise the ; two teenage Johnson
    daughters !with competent authority. Civil Rights He engineered passage of
    the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, the first national legislation in
    this field since 1875, which estab lished the first national Civil Rights
    Commission, strengthened the Federal Government's power to intervene in
    localities which prevent Negroes from voting. Senator Johnson has pledged
    support of the Civil Rights Plank of the 1960 Democratic Party Platform
    which calls for a na tional Fair Employment Practices Commission, at least a
    start at desegregation in every school district in the Nation by 1963, and
    use of the full powers provided in the Civil Rights Acts of 1958 and 1960 to
    secure for all Ameri cans the right to vote. A former school teacher, John

Heading: Topic for Debate
Content: During the last few months the American voter has had an opportunity to see the
    two candidates under fire in face to face debate. This was a most rewarding
    experience for the voting public. For the first time the voter was able to
    evaluate the man, and not an artificially created image. Today's front page
    carries the name of the Presi dent-Elect of "the United States. If it is the
    name of Senator John F. Kennedy the experts will say that he benefitted from
    the debates. If the name is that of Vice- President Nixon, the talk will be
    that he overcame the setbacks he suffered as a result of the debates. The
    purpose here is not to decide who came off best from the debates, but to
    express our hearty approval of them-. There is no way as effective in
    gauging the respec tive merits of two men as seeing them together in face to
    face exchange. It is hard to judge the actual impact of any of the
    instruments of mass media, however the de bates were a test of mind and not
    fiery oration, which is so effective in politics, and were therefore
    beneficial. The Bucknellian has not taken a stand for either party, rather
    we have tried to evaluate the important develop ments in the campaign. All
    that can be said at this point is that the people have made their choice,
    and all of us are dependent on it being a good one. It has been said that
    "Elections are the ceremonial of Democracy." True as that may be, it is up
    to us to keep Democracy an alive and vital quantity. It is the youth of a
    country which determines its future, let us all be thankful for the chance
    for a free vote and not lose sight of the work necessary to keep our vote
    free.

Heading: THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE
Content: At the Constitutional Conven tion in 1887 one hotly debated question was:
    "Should we have a president?" Many of the delegates were afraid that a
    single Chief Execu tive would have altogether too many chances to turn
    himself into a dictator, and favored the estab lishment of a three-man execu
    tive committee to carry out the will of the Legislature. The most important
    reason why supporters of a one-man execu tive finally won out may well have
    been that everybody was sure that George Washington-- whom all the delegates
    knew and trusted--would get the job. Pierce Butler, a delegates from South
    Carolina, wrote to a friend after the Convention was over; "Entre nous, I do
    not believe that the executive powers would have been so great, had not many
    of the "members cast their eyes toward General Washington as President, and
    shaped their ideas of the powers to be given a | President by their opinions
    of his | virtue." Presidential Monarchy Even so, not everybody w as1 happy.
    Patrick Henry, of "give me lib erty or give me death" fame, who was so
    opposed to strong central government that he had refused | even to attend
    the Convention, I called the Presidency "an awful i squint towhrd monarchy."
    (As a matter of fact, there had! been those who wouldn't have | thought a
    constitutional monarchy | was a bad dea at all--but Wash-1 an average of 944
    laws and 60 executive orders a year. Wash ington granted nine pardons and
    gave Federal jobs to 65 people in 1791; Ike has averaged an annual 112
    pardons and 43,537 jobs (in cluding military and Post Office appointments).
    Washington's first budget was written on a single sheet of paper; the
    current Eisen hower budget runs to 1030 pages, with a 158-page appendix.
    Today's President holds down pot one job, but five--and any one of the five
    could fill an eight- hour day. He is; Head of State, the nation's chief
    ceremonial officer--a job that in volves everything from presiding at
    banquets for visiting digni taries to throwing out the first baseball of the
    season for the Washington Senators. Chief Diplomat, the leader of the Free
    World and the U. S.' top presentative in its dealings with all other
    nations. Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces. Chief Legislative Policy-
    Mak- 'rr, with power to exercise tre mendous influence on the making of our
    laws by initiating or 3 mending bills, pushing them through Congress or
    vetoing them. Chief Executive, the boss of all Federal employees (there are
    2718 i n his own Executive Offices alone) and the top law enforce ment
    officer. He is also, of course, the head of his political party, and must J
    often keep its welfare in mind. Changed Election The way we choose the man
    to Vice President of another (as hap pened in 1796, when Federalist John
    Adams came in first and Democrat - Republican Thomas Jefferson second). Or
    the winner j and the runner-up might be men who couldn't stand each other |
    personally So in 1804, the Twelfth Amend - ' ment to the Constitution
    provided for separate balloting for the two offices. By then, electors from
    each. state were being pledged in ad- j vance to the Presidential candi- ]
    dates already chosen by their par- ties. * | And by the 1820's, most states!
    had established urjiversal suffrage j and provided for popuar election i of
    electors--which meant popular election of the President. Mere Formality The
    balloting of the Electoral I College had become the mere formality it is
    today. An elector still can, however theoretically, vote for anybody he
    pleases--and this happened as recently as 1956, when an Alabama elector
    decided to , cast his vote not for Eisen hower or Stevenson, but for a
    gentleman named Walter

Content: 

Heading: THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
Content: 

Heading: PREAMBLE
Content: The common danger of man kind is war and the threat of war. Today, three billion
    human beings live in fear that some rash act or ] blunder may plunge us all
    into a j nuclear holocaust which will | leave only ruined cities, blasted i
    homes, and a poisoned earth and | sky. Our objective, however, is not the
    right to coexist in armed camps on the same planet with totalitarian
    ideologies; it is the creation of an enduring peace in which the universal 1
    values of human dignity, truth, and justice under law are finally secured
    for all men everywhere on earth. If America is to work effective ly for such
    a peace, we must first restore our national strength-- military, political,
    economic, and moral. * National Defense This is the strength that must be
    erected: (1) Deterrent military power; (2) balanced conventional mili tary
    forces; (3) continuous mod ernization of these forces through intensified
    research and develop ment; and (4) re-examination of the organization of our
    armed forces. We pledge our will, energies, and resources to oppose Commun
    ist aggression. Arms Control A  primary task is to develop responsible
    proposals that will help break the deadlock on arms control. Such proposals
    should include means for ending nuclear tests under workable safeguards, cut
    ting back nuclear weapons, reduc ing conventional forces, preserv ing outer
    space for peaceful pur poses, preventing surprise attack, and limiting the
    risk of accidental war. Instruments of Foreign Policy We will recruit
    officials whose experience, humanity, and dedi cation fit them for the task
    of ef fectively representing America abroad. We will provide a more sensi
    tive and creative direction to our overseas information program. And we will
    overhaul our ad ministrative machinery so that America may avoid diplomatic
    embarrassments and at long last speak with a single confident voice in world
    affairs, i Economic Growth The new Democratic Adminis tration will
    confidently proceed to free American labor, industrial leadership, and
    capital, to create an abundance that \4ill outstrip any other system. We
    Democrats believe that our economy can and must grow at an average rate of
    5% annually, almost twice as fast as our aver age annual rate since 1953. We
    pledge ourselves to policies that will achieve this goal without in flation.
    . An End to Tight Money As the first step in speeding economic growth, a
    Democrat President will put an end to the high-interest tight-money policy.
    A new Democratic Administra tion will reject this philosophy of economic
    slowdown. We are com mitted to maximum employment, at' decent wages and with
    fair profits, in a far more productive, sxpanding economy. Control of
    Inflation The American consumer has a right to fair prices. We are de
    termined to secure that right. A fair share of the gains from ncreasing
    productivity in rrtany Industries should be passed on to the consumer
    through price. re actions. Minimum Wages We pledge to raise the mini- num
    wage to $1.25 an hour and to extend coverage to several mil lion workers not
    now protected. Agriculture We shall take positive action to raise farm
    income to full parity levels and to preserve the family farming as a way of
    life. We shall put behind us once and for all the timidity with which our
    Government has view 'd our abundance of food and fiber. We will set new high
    levels of food consumption both at home and abroad. The new Democratic
    Adminis- | tration will act to make our free economy really free--free from
    | the oppression of monopolistic power, and free from the suffo cating
    impact of high interest !rates. We will'help create an economy in which
    small busi- | nesses can take root, grow, and I flourish, j Health We shall
    provide medical care benefits, for the aged as part of the time-tested
    Social Security insurance system. We reject any proposal which would require
    such citizens tcf submit to the in dignity of a means test--a "paup er's
    oath." A Program for the Aging The Democratic Administration will end the
    neglect of our older citizens. They deserve lives of usefulness, dignity,
    independence, and participation. We shall as sure them not only health care
    but employment for those who want work, decent housing, and recreation.
    Education America's young people are our greatest resource for the fu ture.
    Each of them deserves the ] education which will best develop his
    potentialities. We shall .act at once to help in | building the classrooms
    and em- j ploying the teachers that are es sential if the right to a good
    edu cation is to have genuine meaning for all the youth of America in | the
    decade ahead. ; Fiscal Responsibility We vigorously reject the notion that
    America, with a half-trillion- dollar gross -national product, and ! nearly
    half of the world's indus- I trial resources, cannot afford to 4.

Heading: Solution to Presidential Quiz
Content: 1. Theodore Roosevelt, 42, was the youngest man to be elected President. , 2.
    The President's salary is $100,000 a year. 3. Virginia has produced more
    Presidents than any other state-- eight: Washington Jefferson, Madison,
    Monroe, William H. Harrison, Tyler, Taylor, and Wilson. Andrew Johnson never
    went to school. (Lincoln--general be lief to the contrary--attended, for
    short periods, two schools in Kentucky before he was seven, and three other
    schools af ter his family moved to southern Indiana. His formal educa tion
    totaled less than a year, but Johnson had no formal schooling whatsoever.)
    5. The three Presidents who were assassinated were: Abraham Lincoln, 1865;
    James A. Garfield, 1881; and William McKin ley, 1901. Andrew Johnson was the
    only President to face impeachment. When he removed Secretary of State
    Stanton from office and replaced him with Grant, Congress denied the
    President's right to remove a cabinet member. At his trial by the Senate,
    the vote was 35 for conviction, 19 for acquital. As a two-thirds majority is
    necessary for conviction, he was acquitted. Grover Cleveland was married in
    the White House to Miss Frances Folsom on June 2, 1886. Rutherford B. Hayes
    received fewer popular votes than Samuel J. Tilden in 1877, but was elected
    by 185 electoral votes to 184. In 1888, Benjamin Harrison received fewer
    pop- ular votes than Grover Cleveland but won with 233 electoral votes to
    168. --The Reader's Digest 6 . 7. 8 . meet our needs at home and in our
    world relationships. We believe, moreover, that ex cept in periods of
    recession or na tional emergency, these needs can be met with a balanced
    budget, | with no increase in present tax rates, and with some surplus for
    the gradual reduction of our ria- | tional debt. To assure such a balance we
    ' shall pursue a four-point program 1 j of fiscal responsibility', j First,
    we shall end the gross i ! waste in Federal expenditures1 | which needlessly
    raises the bud- I I gets of many Government agen- | cies. Second, we shall
    collect the bil-1 Ions in taxes which are owed to j | the Federal Government
    but not \ now collected. Third, we shall close the loop- i holes in the tax
    laws by which I certain privileged groups legally escape their fair share of
    taxation. | Fourth, we shall bring in added Federal tax revenues by expand
    ing the economy itself. Each dol lar of additional production puts an
    additional 18 cents in tax rev enue in the national treasury. A 5% growth
    rate, therefore, will mean that at the end of four years the Federal
    Government will have had a total of nearly $50 billion in additional tax
    revenues above those presently received. Civil Rights The Democratic
    Administration which takes office next January will therefore use the full
    powers provided in the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 to secure for all
    Americans the right to vote. Similarly the new Democratic Administration
    will take action to end discrimination in Federal housing programs,
    including Fed erally assisted housing.

    the B. S. degree. The proposed B. S. degree is designed for the student who
    wishes to become a profes- sibnal geologist or who plans on pursuing
    graduate wojk in geol ogy, geochemistry, geophysics, or oceanography. The
    proposed de gree program offers a minimum of essential courses in the basic
    sciences of mathematics, chemis try and physics for the scientifi- ally-
    oriented student who desires a career in Earth Science. .It will provide him
    with an adequate background to pursue his science studies at the graduate
    level, but interested students will be urged to elect additional work in
    chem istry, mathematics and biology. Basic sciences are receiving in creased
    emphasis in geology cur ricula throughout the country and without the

Content: An unknown car plowed around the campus on election night leav ing a wake of
    damage as it went. The car ran into and destroyed the sign outside of the
    Memorial Gateway and the one for the new administration center. At the
    bottom of the hill the car appar ently drove over the lawn of Owens House,
    across Sixth Street and through the bushes bordering on the Sem. Making a
    wide circle on the grass in front of Harris Tall, the car again swept
    throu8h the bushes and returned to the street. The car must have been going
    at a pretty fair speed, since several bushes were completely uprooted and
    the wires running through them severed completely. Campus police are
    currently in the process of checking all cars in the area in the hopes some
    clues may be found as to the identity of the culprits. This Sunday Dr.

Heading: 'Naturalistic' Drama
Content: by Mike Ingraham Last weekend, Cap & Dagger attempted its most difficult play in
    four years. It was Gorki's The Lower Depths, an example of " naturalistic"
    drama, depicting the demoralized, poverty-stricken state of the Russian
    citizenery be fore the revolution. Naturalism, a form of Realism, tends to
    emphasize the morbid side of life and to escape tradi tional theatrical
    devices of plot development and resolution; ap pearing, as it were, to be
    merely a segment of human existence lifted, quite arbitrarily, out of
    context. There seems to be no beginning, middle, and end in suph drama, nor
    is anything solv ed, resolved, or completed. At the beginning of The Lower
    Depths, we see a group of dis couraged individuals and at the end we see
    this same group in the same state of mind, minus a few characters who have
    died. It would seem as if nothing has hap pened, nothing has been settled.
    But, of course, a great deal has happened in the transition and much
    accomplished. Characters We have come to understand the 16 characters in the
    play as distinct and separate individuals by their responses to their en
    vironment and to the old man, Luka. If nothing is drastically changed at the
    end, it is not be cause of the playwright's inepti tude, but because of the
    charac ters themselves. The Baron, played by Bruce Matthews, an example of
    the idle, irresponsible aristocrat suddenly thrown upon his own resources,
    never develops because of his es sentially insubstantial nature and limited
    mentality. Bubnoff, the realist of the play, stubbornly re sists the
    idealistic nonsense of Luka and remains a detached observer throughout.
    Stage Position Notice that he stays on the left side of the stage for almost
    the entire action, indicating his ad amant position. Andrushka Kleshtch,
    portrayed by Mr. Ward Hooker, places himself on the ex treme right and is
    <<manually bathed in an erie green light. He is in the opposite condition
    from Bubnoff--utterly smashed by his environment. However, Nastya, Satine,
    the Actor, Vaska, and Natasha occupy the middle ground--not quite subdued by
    their surroundings and still able to visualize a bet ter existence. And into
    this at mosphere comes the old 1 man, Luka, the catalytic agent, bring- ng
    promise and chance for escape. The reaction is immediate--the hopeful fasten
    onto him for in spiration while the wretched scorn and abuse. Christ Image A
    Christ without a heaven, the old man spins fantasies and par ables to
    elleviate his people's misery. Many act on his advice and find themselves in
    worse con dition than before--Vaska mur ders, the Actor commits suicide,

Content: by Jim Godshall | Nearly 3,000 fans sat through | intermittent rain and snow
    last Saturday as Bucknell edged the Colgate Red Raiders 12 to 8 at Hamilton,
    New York. Bucknell received the opening kickoff and after a 20-yard return
    the ball was placed on Bucknell's 40-yard line. From this point I Paul
    Terhes took command and j by mixing passes with running. plays the ball was
    advanced t o ' the Colgate 15 yard line. This set up a hand off to captain
    Mel- | berger who promptly drove the] remaining 15 yards for Bucknell's
    first tally, thus successfully com pleting a 60-yard drive. The try for the
    extra point was wide and the score stood 6-0. More first quarter excitement
    I found Colgate in Bucknell terri tory and faced with a punting sit uation.
    The Colgate kick was a I high deep shot carrying to B uck-; nell's three
    where Ashton Ditka ' was waiting under it. Following the catch he took
    several steps backward into the end zone and t was brought down by softie
    hard charging Colgate tacklers.: ! The play gave Colgate a two-point safety
    against Bucknell, making the score 6 to 2. Bucknell's second touchdown was
    set up in the second quarter when Pat Malone recovered a Colgate fumble on
    the Red Raid ers 19-yard line. On two plays.; the ball was advanced to the
    10-1 yard line where Ray Cosgrove re ceived a handoff from Elliott and ran
    off tackle for a 10-yard gain and Bucknell"s second and last: touchdown of
    the afternoon. The try for the conversion resulted in j an uncompleted pass
    making the* score 12 to 2. Later on in the second quarter; a Colgate threat
    was thwarted a s; a result of the alert line play of Kirk Foulke, who
    recovered a Colgate fumble. This time Buck nell was unable to move- the
    ball. With a fourth and six situation, Rick Elliott came in to punt and got
    away, a beauty. One of the decisive factors in Bucknell's vic tory is
    attributed to the kicking demonstration put on by Elliott. Time afer time he
    got away some of his best kicks of the season. Colgate's only touchdown came
    after nine minutes and 55 seconds of the second quarter had gone by. Dan
    Keating, Colgate's 175- pound quarterback, scampered around his left end,
    and bounced off several would-be tacklers, for a ^picturesque 63-yard run.
    The try for the extra point was wide and the score at halftime read Bucknell
    12, Colgate 8. The second half was dominated for the most part by Colgate.
    Time and again the Red Raiders had Bucknell against the wall. Hard hitting,
    heads up, defensive play, kept Colgate from capitaliz ing on ^several
    scoring opportuni ties. Late in the fourth quarter the fans were brought to
    their feet when Colgate quarterback Dan Keating faded back to pass. Un able
    to find any open recevers he decided to run and scooted 41 yards only to
    have the run and touchdown nullified by a clipping penalty. The scoring
    threat fin ally ended when the Bisons in tercepted a pass on the 20-yard
    line. Again Bucknell was unable to move the ball and had to call on Elliott
    to punt. With less than two minutes remaining in the game, Elliott punted
    the ball to the Colgate 30-yard line where the ball was whistled dead. On
    ths last series of downs, Colgate found a fired up Bison line wait ing to
    turn back any threat. As a result Colgate was unable to pick up a yard in
    four tries.

Heading: BUCKNELL'S FOURTH
Content: Bucknell University's football team has placed a man on the ECAC All-East team
    of the week for the fourth week in a row Starting with Paul Terhes in the
    Rutgers game the Bisons have had a representative on every first squad named
    since that con test. Terhes got the nod again for his performance against La
    fayette, and Ashton Ditka was named one of the two outstand ing halfbacks in
    the East, for his spectacular performance against Lehigh. In a game which
    took a heavy toll upon the physical strength of Bucknell, Kirk Foulke was
    named one of the two out standing tackles of the week by the ECAC. "King-
    sized" Kirk is a 6-2, 210 pound native of Philadelphia who has knocked
    enough heads to gether this season to capture two of "Chuckles Ax-Murder"
    awards. Hampered by a leg injury last season, Fouke has been one of the
    members of the defensive line who has gone through this cam paign
    unscatched. It was Foulke who led the defense in holding off the late drives
    of Colgate, and broke up one scoring threat of the Red Raiders by
    recoverirlg a fumble. Tackles aren't usually considered the "bread and
    butter" boys of any football team and more often than not their best work
    goes unseen. Selection on the All-East team is little enough reward for a
    man with the mean- est, roughest job in the sport.

    j was no impediment to the Bisons | who literally ran away with the | game
    in the second half. Bucknell tallied first as quarter- | back Don Rodgers

    end. ! He also' kicked the extra point. I After Lehigh scored on a 25-yard
    pass play, the Bisons retaliated on a 40-yard pass play from Rod gers to
    halfback Matt Hart. Don | kicked the extra point, and Buck- | nell led 14-7

Content: 

Heading: 'The Idea of the University: An Inquiry'
Content: To the student body, The aim of the University is to provide atmosphere
    conducive' to the intellectual endeavors of its students. Here the faculty
    and j students together engage in ex- j amining facets of life which have i
    previously been accepted, but not i questioned. In their ques.t for
    knowledge, students would profit by investi-! gating the nature of the
    univer-; sity community itself. What i's the purpose of this process of j
    gaining an education? What real meaning do all the class hours, j homework
    requirements, and e x -: tra-curricular activities have in ' relation to
    life after graduation? ; These questions are pertinent to i each member of
    the university j community, because they appeal to a heightened self-
    examination, and are a deeper appreciation of the purpose of an institution
    of higher learning. Within two days the Bucknell campus will be involved in
    the intensive Religion-in-Life Pro gram's study of The Idea of The
    University. This year's theme is based on the apparent student need to
    define what he expects from the university. Because of the thorough study in
    the pro gram, it requires full cooperation of both faculty and students for
    its success. Compared to previbus Religion- in-Life Programs based on esoter
    ic and philosophical topics, this year's experience promises to be unique.
    Its origin stems from student iequests for a theme with "grass root"
    potential ideas which are applicable to the Bucknell sit uation. It is the
    strong desire of the Christian Association that each member of the Bucknell
    commun ity will devote himself whole heartedly to this opportunity for
    introspective study, and will delve critically into The Idea of The
    University. The Christian Association Cabinet November 5, 1960 To the
    Editor: Your efforts to raise the intel lectual level of the Bucknellian are
    appreciated. The article on the Algerian war was particularly informative,
    and the debate on the election is commendable, but how can you hope to raise
    the level of student thought to mat ters of current or perennial im portance
    when you print an inane, petty editorial like that in the No vember fourth
    issue deploring the administration's failure to plan ahead with respect to
    stairwells, tree-planting, water mains, paths and highways?. Even if these
    things are matters commanding student eoncern, they do not seem to merit the
    petty and bitter sar casm of this editorial. Perhaps the thoughts of your
    editorial writers could be diverted to such topics as the Algerian War, the
    high caliber of new teachers coming to Bucknell, the value of the dormitory
    counseling program, the effectiveness of the Christian Association's-
    program, federal aid to education, public versus private power or the im
    plications of Khrushchev's blus tering tactics at the U. N. I hope you were
    not being whimsical or sarcastic when you congratulated your readers in this
    year's first Bucknellian for their interest in serious matters reflected by
    read ing the editorial page. Sincerely, * William R. Keech

Heading: Reviews College Purpose, Programs, Students
Content: by Bruce Benia In order for the campus to par- j ticipate thoughtfully in the
    Re- ; ligion-in-Life program this week- : end, Dr. Douglas E. Sturm has i
    prepared an excellent syllabus, The Idea of the University: An Inquiry. Dr.
    Sturm has organiz- ; ed his inquiry into three main di- i visions--the
    ^purposes, the pro gram, and the participants in a j college. Purposes The
    views on the purposes of a university may be broadly classi fied into three
    basic divisions. \ The first classification is \ that a university education
    should pr6- | vide a student with useful infor- I mation, both for his own
    practical I benefit and for the strength of his I democratic society. A
    quotation from a Harvard re- j port on education reveals one ar- ! gument
    for the intellectual pur- ! pose of a university: "Intelligence is not a
    special function but a j way in which all human powers i may function.
    Intelligence is that | leaven of awareness and reflection j which, operating
    upon the native ; powers of men, raises them from ' the animal level and
    makes them truly human . . . Thus the fruit i of education is intelligence
    in ac- j tion/ The aim is mastery of life; and since living is an art,
    wisdom I is the indispensable means to this | end." ' After noting mediating
    views of ' these two main positions, Dr. Sturm's syllabus presents the third
    principle argument--that educatio/i should strengthen the moral character of
    the students. A variation of the moral view (The Christian viewpoint) con
    cludes the first section of the in quiry. % Program Necessarily,, the
    purposes of a university, in order to be applic able, must be carried out by
    cur ricular and extra-curricular pro grams. After a few statements favoring
    a unified curriculum, the syllabus suggests that a col lege, if it believes
    in a useful pur pose, should program courses Leading to normal maturity of

Heading: A MODEST PROPOSAL
Content: A movement is afoot--a shocking, startling movement--to solve the problem of
    overcrowded colleges by the simple expe dient of refusing admission to women
    at coeducational schools! It is argued by proponents of this plan that in
    today's world a college education is absolutely essential for a man, while
    for a woman it is merely a pleasant interlude between adolescence and
    housewifery. There is simply not room enough for both men and women in our
    overburdened colleges; therefore, in all fair ness, women who have far less
    need of a degree than men, must yield their places. Well sir, when I heard
    this drastic proposal, I was so shocked that I sat right down and lit a
    Marlboro. I always sit right down and light a Marlboro when I am shocked. I
    also always sit right down and light a Marlboro when I am not shocked. There
    is no time, no condition, no mood, no estate when it isn't a source of soul-
    deep gratification to settle back and have a full-flavored smoke--Marlboro,
    the filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste --Marlboro, the jewel of
    cigarettes--Marlboro, the pinnacle of the tobacconist's art--Marlboro, my
    comfort, haven, and snug harbor. Well sir, I sat smoking my Marlboro and
    thinking over the shocking proposal to keep women out of coed schools, and
    hoping fervently that another solution can be found. If the calamitous day
    ever comes when women are banned from coed colleges, I will gnash my teeth
    and rend my garments and take to my bed without supper. Like any other
    Marlboro man,

Heading: I
Content: love women. I love the sight and sound of them, the cut of their jibs, their
    beauty and grace, their cunning little spitcurls, their sleek dimples, their
    middy blouses, their aura and effluvium. More over, I freely admit that when
    it comes to brainpower, they can give the average man cards and spades and
    big casino too. It would be a shame, a disgrace and a catastrophe to keep
    these beautiful, intelligent creatures out of college. However, it is always
    wise in time of fair weather to prepare for foul. What if the advocates of
    keeping women out of college begin to gather strength? We who abhor this
    fiendish plan must be ready with a substitute . . .  and it just so happens
    I have one--and a mighty ingenious little plan it is,, if I say so myself.
    Granted that classroom seats are in short supply, and granted that men need
    degrees more than women, it is still not necessary to bar women from
    college. Let them go ts college but--here is the beauty part of my plan--
    don't let them go to class!

    the country. This I conference is watched by politic- | ians and diplomats
    to determine j an index of undergraduate stu-1 dent opinion on national
    policies, i In the past, several of the student I proposals have been
    heeded, and: have been given much considera- i tion in the formation of

    Three Objectives SCUSA has three objectives: I (1) to produce an informative
    ex- ; amination and discussion of the I national security policy of the j
    United States; (2) to provide an outstanding representation of col- f lege
    students with an appreciation j of the complexities of government! policy
    formulation; (3) to broaden ! the students' contact with their j
    contemporaries in an academic: endeavor. After having examin- | ed certain
    of the current prob- | lems of national security, the con ference hopes to
    arrive at some concrete recommendations as to courses of action which could
    best I contribute to the solution of the problems. Organization of
    Conference The conference is organized in the following manner. In addi tion
    to a suggested reading list which has been forwarded to all the applicants,
    the opening ad dress and panel discussion will provide common reference
    points for initiating round-table discus sions. Round-table discussion
    topics have been divided into functional areas. The five areas of discussion
    are: (1) The Com munist Challenge; (2) The At lantic Community; (3) Less-
    De-1 veloped Areas; (4) Arms Control; 5) Building an International Or- j
    der. Pearson has been assigned I to the group discussing the Com- j munisl
    Challenge and Green has i been assigned to the group deal- j ing with Arms
    Control. During the conference there are panel discussions to supple- | ment
    resolutions and suggestions made by the individual groups. Also, each group
    will have an adviser, who is acquainted with the area under consideration.
    On the last day of the conference, the participants will have the oppor
    tunity to hear the conclusions reached by each discussion area. I One member
    from each group I will summarize the findings of I his group. Tonight is the

Heading: Win or Share It
Content: Squeaked not swamped, yet still the winner is Jack Kennedy. As in all contests
    one side must lose and one must win, otherwise there would be no reason to
    toil for victory. Despite the extreme narrowness of his margin in the
    popular vote column, Senator Kennedy has become President-Elect Kennedy.
    <<President of those who voted. Democratic only? Hardly, John F. Kennedy is
    the 34th president of the United States of America. However, a good number
    of Bucknell students don't believe that Kennedy is to be the next president
    or they have no respect for the office of President of the United States.
    During the half-time ceremonies of last week's football game, the Temple
    Uniyersity Band was present ing a musical tribute to some of America's past
    chief ex ecutives. Their last tribute was a song dedicated to Mr. Kennedy.
    Unfortunately for America and even Bucknell this song was met with Boo's and
    shouts of derision fill ed the air. It is possible that this demonstration
    was aimed at the musical abilities of the Temple Band, but more probably it
    was made against the President-Elect. It is indeed un fortunate when those
    who call themselves Americans give every evidence of being barbarians.

Heading: service!
Content: The old phrase "Service with a smile," and the accompanying connotation of a
    willing ness to accommodate customers, seems to be completely beyond the
    comprehension of the Merit Laundry Com pany. For instance, the times set up
    for linen exchange are rather restrictive. If you are unable to take your
    linen to the exchange point at the prescribed time, you incur the wrath of
    Merit's representative the following week be cause you have failed to
    "exchange your linens every week--soiled or not." The exchange of linens
    requires other exactness,, too. For example, be sure the pieces of your
    "unit" are neatly folded and piled in the right order, or they may not be
    accepted by the linen exchange worker. He may even shove the whole pile on
    the floor and grunt something-to you about refolding them. It used to be so
    convenient to have linens delivered to your room each week. But now,
    students not only have to carry their soiled linens to an exchange point,
    but they also run the risk of having their "unit" stolen. The Uni versity
    laundry performed another small, yet important, service; they welcomed
    students back each fall by making their beds for them before they arrived.
    Now if students arrive after Merit Laundry closing hours they are forced to
    sleep without sheets their first night on campus. Head residents do have an
    extra unit on hand, but this is little help to the second or third
    latecomer. If Merit Laundry is interested in deserving the title Service for
    its commodity, the least it can do is: (1) ex tend exchange hours; (2)
    devise a less time-consuming system of exchange (such as a "de-assembly"
    line where the student files past the laundry bins and deposits each piece
    of his own soiled unit, and is then handed a new unit); (3) encourage its
    adult employees to assume a more courteous attitude.

Content: Editor: It is curious to me that Bruce Bonta, whose reporting seems usually to
    be accurate as well as interesting, should make such a gross error in
    reviewing the book let entitled The Idea of the Uni versity in last week's
    Bucknellian. I quote from his review: "After noting mediating views of these
    two main positions, Dr. Sturm's syllabus presents the third prin ciple
    argument--that education should strengthen the moral char acter of the
    students. A variation of the moral view (the Christian viewpoint) concludes
    the first sec tion of the inquiry." On the other hand, I quote from the
    booklet: "This (referring to tlfe preceding quotation in the booklet) would
    seem to identify the Christian view of the univer sity with the position
    that es pouses the cultivation of the in tellect as the purpose of higher
    education." (p. 9). There fol low quotations from Jerald Brauer and Jacques
    Maritain in support of this hypothesis. Indeed, I myself would argue that
    the - intellectualist under standing of the nature and pur pose of the
    university (that it exists for the pursuit of the truth) is integral to the
    Christian under-1 standing of the nature of man. This same point was

Content: Three in-service training pro grams have been introduced at Bucknell for the
    first time this season. Under the sponsorship of the National Defense
    Education Act, teachers are attending classes in mathematics, science and
    foreign language on a strictly voluntary basis in order to in crease their
    own knowledge of a subject and to ultimately improve their effectiveness as
    teachers. The foreign language program in Variety, was made in Germany in
    1925. It was directed by PS. A. Dupont and stars Emil Jannings and Lya de
    Putti. The second film, Jofroi, is a comedy based on a story by Jean Giono.
    Marcel Pagnol produced and directed the movie which stars Vincent Scotto,
    Henri Pou- pon, Charles Blavette, and Annie Toinon. The dialogue .is French
    with English subtitles. Jofroi was first released in French is particularly

    interested in a career in the public service who will re ceive their B. A.
    in June have been offered an opportunity to apply for fellowships to study
    at three different universities. The fellowship is $2,000 for the year plus
    college fees. Each fellowship approximates $2,500 in total value. Beginning
    this June, fellows will serve a three-months' intern ship with a
    governmental agency in Alabama, Kentucky, or Ten nessee such as the TV A,
    the Marshall Space Flight Center, a city, or a department in one of the
    state governments. In the 1961-62 school session, they will take graduate
    courses at the Uni versities of Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Completion
    of the twelve- months' training period entitles fellows to a certificate in
    Public Administration. They can be awarded a Master's degree at either of

    grant of $25,0t)0 from the Ford Foundation. The new curriculum covers ac
    counting, business administration, and economics, and stresses thought
    processes rather than particularized subject matter. In addition to required
    economics and business administration courses, the program emphasizes work
    in mathematics, logic, and in the behavioral sciences. Dr. Headley expressed
    hope that this new step in teaching thought pro cesses will develop into "an

Content: by John Minsker Playing before the home crowd for the last time this season, the
    Bison football team romped to their sixth win of the year by a score of 23-0
    at the expense of the Owls from Temple University. Coach Bob Odell's forces
    ran up their third shutout of the cam paign behind the unerring accur acy of
    Turk Terhes' arm and a stalwart defense that has helped keep Bucknell on top
    all season. Terhes threw three touchdown passes; two to Ash Ditka and the
    other to captain Mickey Melberg- er, while the standout defense corps
    recovered'three fumbles, intercepted five Temple passes, and held the Owls
    to a mere 106 yards for the afternoon. The Bisons wasted little time in
    scoring their first touchdown. On the opening kickoff, Dick Orlow- ski
    knocked the Temple ball car rier unconscious and Dean Stump recovered the
    fumble on the Owls' 37-yard line. On the second play from scrimmage, Terhes
    toured right end to the 19 and a first down. Ren Twiford and Ash Ditka each
    bulled for two yards, and then Paul lofted a 15-yard aerial to Mickey
    Melberger for the score. Ron Maslanik's perfect placement gave BU a 7-0
    lead. Terhes and company marched almost the length of the field for their
    second touchdown. Starting from their own six yard stripe the Orange and
    Blue rolled 94 yards in nine plays. Ken Twiford initiated the trek by
    splitting the center of the line for 16 yards to the 27. Then Terhes began
    an aerial barrage. First he hit Ron Maslanik on the 36, then Ditka to the 48
    and again to the Temple 47. His fourth consecutive com pleted pass was
    snared by Dick Tyrrell on the 30. Ash Ditka broke through the line on a re
    verse to the 14, and Mickey Mel berger carried to the 10. Terhes then tossed
    a 10-yarder to Ditka for the TD. Paul also ran for a two-point conversion
    and Buck nell led at halftime by 15-0. , .The Bisons tallied their last
    score early in the third period. Ray Cosgrove took a punt at the midfield
    stripe and twisted and turned to the Temple 34-yard line. A moment later,
    Terhes and Dit ka collaborated on the most spec tacular play of the day.
    Back to .pass, Terhes was almost thrown for a 15-yard loss, but he shook off
    one tackier and eluded two more before heaving a long des peration aerial.
    Ditka raced for the ball and was interfered with by a Temple defender. He
    still managed to clutch the pigskin and scamper into the end zone for the
    touchdown. Terhes " then threw to Ditka again for the two- point conversion
    and a 23-0 lead. F r o m . .  .

Content: - ------- - --------------------- - ------------- >> The Roughest Sport Eight
    weekends ago, Bucknell fielded a strong, healthy, well bal anced football
    team, with an outstanding quarterback and a better than average line. That
    better than average line developed into one of the outstanding defensive
    units in the Middle Atlantic Conference, | but at a cost which can only be
    described as incredible. As of tomor- I row's s6asoh-ending contest' with
    Delaware, only one man from the line that opened against Gettysburg remains
    intact. Kirk Foulke, a 210-lb. tackle, who has been on an All-East team this
    season, is the sole survivor. Chaump Started It It all started back in the
    second quarter of the G-Burg game when Don Chaump had to be taken out of the
    game with a broken leg. This, at the time, was a serious setback to Bison
    fortunes, but one that fortunately was later remedied by some fast
    developing ball players. Against Cornell, Denny Morgan, a 200-lb. tackle was
    knock ed out of the game with an injury which has plagued him all season.
    Fullback Bill Urch was also " decommissisoned" in the contest. Some where
    along the line, Tom Alexander, a "Chuckles" winner and one of the
    outstanding defenders on the team became ill, and hasn't re gained his full
    health to date. Charlie- Horses Ron Hohowski, 235-lb. guard, sat out a game
    because of an in jured ankle, and soph Dick Johnson twisted an ankle against
    Lafay ette, which came back in the Temple game. John Sommers got rack ed up,
    Ron Maslanik caught a couple of bad "charley-horses," but continued to play
    great football, and even Turk had a "horse," which was disguised as a leg
    injury for the benefit of the press. Colgate Disaster This loss of personnel
    seemed negligible, however, when, the at trition rate from the Colgate game
    was finally totaled. The Bisons narrowly squeaked by 12-8, to post their
    fifth win, but the loss in manpower staggers the imagination. Three players
    were knocked out for good, and another played against Temple with a broken
    toe. | Walt Mayer and Tom Noteware received cracked limbs, as did Dick
    Tyrrell,' while Bob Williams took a "shot" on the knee on the open ing play
    of the second half that oaused hemorrhaging. The cold i weather and
    seemingly endless Colgate reserves took a heavy toll of I the Bison line.

Heading: HOW  TO BEAT THE BEAT GENERATION
Content: My cousin Herkie Nylet is a sturdy lad of nineteen summers who has, we all
    believed until recently, a lively intelligence and an assured future.
    Herkie's father, Walter O. Nylet, is as every one knows, president of the
    First National Artificial Cherry Company, world's largest maker of
    artificial cherries for ladies' hats. Uncle Walter had great plans for
    Herkie. Last year he sent Herkie to the Maryland College of Humanities,
    Sciences, and Artificial Cherries, and he intended, upon Herkie's gradu
    ation, to find him a nice fat wife and take him into the firm as a full
    partner. Could a young man have more pleasing prospects? Of course not. But
    a couple of months ago, to everyone's consternation, Herkie announced that
    he was not going into the artificial cherry business. Nor was he going to
    stay in college. " I am," said I * Herkie, "a member of the Beat Generation.
    I am going to San Francisco and grow a beard." Well sir, you can imagine the
    commotion in the family when Herkie went traipsing off to San Francisco!
    Uncle Walter would have gone after him and dragged him home, but
    unfortunately he was right in the middle of the artificial cherry season.
    Aunt Thelma couldn't go either because of her old leg trouble. (One of her
    legs is older than the other.) So I went. I searched San Francisco for weeks
    before I found Herkie living under the counter of a Pronto Pup stand. "
    Herkie, how are you?" I cried, looking distraughtly upon his tangled beard,
    his corduroy jacket, his stricken eyes. " Beat," said Herkie. I offered him
    a Marlboro and felt instantly better when he took it because when one smokes
    Marlboros, one cannot be too far removed from the world. One still has, so
    to speak, a hold on the finer things of life-like good tobacco, like easy-
    drawing filtration, like settling back and getting comfortable and enjoy ing
    a full-flavored smoke. One is, despite all appearances, basi cally
    happiness-oriented, fulfillment-directed, pleasure-prone. " Herkie, what are
    you doing with yourself?" I asked. " I am finding myself," he replied. " I
    am writing a novel in the sand with a pointed stick. I am composing a fugue
    for clavier and police whistle. I am sculpting in experimental ma
    terials-<<-like English muffins." " And what do you do for fun?" I asked. "
    Come,"  he said and took me to. a dank little night club where men in beards
    and women in basic burlap sat on orange crates and drank espresso. On a tiny
    stage stood a poet reciting a free-form work of his own composition entitled
    Excema: The Story of a Boy while behind him a jazz trio played 200 choruses
    of Tin Roof Blues. " Herkie," said I, "comehome with me to the artificial
    cherries." " No," said Herkie, so sadly I went home to tell Uncle Walter the
    bad news. He was less distressed than I had feared. It seems Uncle Walter
    has another son, a quiet boy named Edvorts, about whom he had completely
    forgotten, and today Edvorts is in business with Uncle Walter and Herkie is
    beat in San Francisco, and everyone is happy. % (c)  1900 Max Shulmaa * * *

    in the past two seasons. Sophomores Hal Smoker. Larry Magargal, Sam
    Pendrose, Kevin Cooney, and Tom Johnson have earned berths on the varsity
    squad mainly for the abilities they demonstrated on the freshman squad last
    season. Lampus, a 6-6, 200 pound cen ter, is expected to be the Bison's big
    rebounder while 6-5 Joe Steiner should be a leading scor er. Steiner was
    named to the second team of the MAC all-star squad. Injuries could prove
    disastrous to the Bisons this season. In prac tice sessions, both Fadden and
    Kniffin fracutred ankles. Kniffin's ankle is now out of its cast, and Dick
    should be ready to play in a few weeks. Fadden, however, will not be able to
    play until after Christmas vacation. Coach Kribbs is confident that this is
    a "good squad." He feels that despite the rough schedule, the squad should
    better its 10-11 record of last season.

Heading: 'Lower Depths' Finest C&D Production
Content: and basically decent character. Although Mr. Hooker sometimes I seemed to be
    searching for his ! next line, he was quite relaxed l in his part. His
    naturalness al- j lowed him to fit easily into the scene. by Nancy Owen The
    Lower Depths, Maxim Gor ki's drama about the dregs of Russian society, was
    one of the finest productions of the Bucknell Cap and Dagger Society in
    recent years. The play was obviously well-directed: movements were effective
    and the pace fast; also, the naturalistic setting added to the viewer's
    enjoyment. The scene was a sooty and grimy cel lar which looked as if a
    dozen people had been daily living in it. However, the scene was not
    necessarily Russian; there was nothing to suggest this country except for a
    tarnished samovar. Yet the viewer did riot really care about this; he was
    still able to leave the theatre feeling that nothing--love, sickness,
    murder, suicide--could affect these people for very long. A band of thieves,
    prostitutes, and gamblers, they were concerned only with day to day
    existence and from where the next drink would come. Actresses Succeed The
    women of the cast were particularly outstanding. All were completely relaxed
    and consistent, ence. in their parts. Judith Levy was j excellent as Nastya,
    a pathetic, prostitute who still tried to con- j vince the others that she
    did have | a true love once. Miss Levy's face is very expressive, and the
    emotions she felt for each of the other characters was apparent. I She
    reached the peak of her per-! formance in the third act when she moved the
    audience greatly I with her story of her one love. As Vassilisa, the evil
    land-lady j who had no scruples and could | plot the death of her husband
    without batting an eyelash, Linda | Garrett again created a marvelous
    characterization. Her voice was | strong and commanding, and she dominated
    the scenes in which she appeared. The audience dis liked Vassilisa from the
    moment she first appeared on the stage. Ellen Headley, a familiar figure on
    the Bucknell stage, turned in a fine portrayal of Natasha, Vas- j silisa's
    younger sister who was afraid to trust anyone. Miss i Headley was convincing
    through- j out the play, and her hysteria, after being brutally beaten, held
    i the audience's attention in the i most powerful scene of the play. Two
    freshmen, Catherine Olerio I and Linda Tamblyn, have a place j in future Cap
    and Dagger produc- tions. Miss Olerio was charming

    atmosphere which pervades Buck nell. She suggested that this was caused in
    part by teaching meth ods which involve objective tests, and by | straight
    lecture courses which do nothing more than re iterate the book. Dr. David
    Martin, Professor of Philosophy, spoke next. He also criticized the lack of
    intellectual activity on the campus and he suggested that one way to change
    this situation might be to elim inate counselors and advisors, along with a
    lessening of the "over-organization of time outside of the academic
    purposes." Bob Scott '61 assumed the task of defending the fraternity system
    against charges that it fosters an un-intellectual atmosphere. He pointed
    out that fraternities are positive influences for grades due to competition
    between houses and within each fraternity. Dr. Richard P. Nickelsen, Pro
    fessor of Geology, spoke next, and said that the student must approach
    education as an individ ual with some purpose. He also brought out the fact
    .that the small student-faculty ration here is misused: that is, students
    come for help instead of to find out more about a particular subject. Frank
    Wood defended the large number of extra-curricular activi ties because they
    provided an op portunity for the student to begin making responsible
    decisions. Dr. Edward Partridge, Profes- j |

    Baron, and this confusion was imparted 1 to | the audience. Every once in a

    lapsed into his confused I state. Mr. Matthews did carry j himself as an

    anti-intellectualism, and said that it resulted from the overdependency of
    most students. He said that, beginning in fresh man week, students learn to
    rely on external factors to make decis ions for them. Calling this the
    "cautious generation," he said that even good students are afraid that they
    cannot "afford" a pro fessor who is reputed to mark "hard." Curriculum
    Change Suggested Following these individual pre- ; sentations, the members-
    fo the 1 panel and the audience were free to ask questions. Many of these,
    questions provoked further dis cussion. The most stimulating of these was a
    question concerning the limiting of the selection of courses to three or
    four a semes ter, or perhaps switching from a two-scmester organization to a
    quarter one. ' Dr. Ebersole said that such a program is being con- |
    sicfered, and further suggestions | along this line would be appreci ated.
    An observation was made by one student that this was suppos ed to be
    Religion-in-Life week, and that so far no mention had been made of God. She
    wanted to know, "where does God fit j in?" Both professors Partridge I and
    Martin, showing more excite- j ment than they had all eyenjng, jumped to
    answer that. They agreed that there was no need to talk about God per se,
    for having sincere seriousness of purpose was being religious. Program
    Evaluated The discussions had shown ; that both the faculty and at least
    some of the student body had a sincere interest in improv ing the
    intellectual atmosphere of the Bucknell campus. . However, the concluding
    moments proved a disappointment, to this observer at least. For it was the
    panel, not the audience, who was desir ous 'of ending the discussion. Twice
    an attempt to end it was prevented by the students. It seems that when such
    an ex change of ideas is taking place, ; professors should be willing to !
    spend more than an hour and a 1 half in discussion; the hour was not so

Content: - (Continued from page 2) Pennsylvania, against Richard [ Boddie, a negro
    student at Buck-1 nell University, during the even- 1 ing of April 27, 1960,
    in order to j determine whether a violation of I Paragraphs A and C of
    Section 4654, title 18, Purdon's Pennsyl vania Statutes Annotated, has j
    taken place. While Jack Trabert was in college he had some definite career
    ideas. He knew what he wanted--a job with a payoff for good judgment and
    hard work. With a B.S. in Business Administration from the University of
    Nebraska, Jack knew he could look in many directions. And he did. He talked
    to 20 companies. And then in August, 1957, joined Northwestern Bell, in
    Omaha, Nebraska. His chance to show what he could do was not long in coming.
    On his first assignment Jack came up with answers that made it possible to
    handle long distance calls made at night in the Omaha area with less force
    and equipment than was needed under the old system. This resulted in a
    $10,000 annual saving. Next, Jack worked on a training and devel opment
    program for "mark sensing" --a new ^method for mechanized processing of long
    dis tance charges. Today, Jack has an important role in plan ning and
    developing telephone facilities to keep pace with Omaha's ever-increasing
    need for long distance services. Jack puts it this way--" If a guy can keep
    his average up, there are places to go in this outfit. A man doesn't have to
    wait around for opportunity to knock--he has all he can handle right from
    the start." I f you want a job in which you're given a chance to show your
    stuff, and held strictly accountable for your decisions, right from the
    start--then' you'll want to visit your Placement Office for literature and
    additional information. " Otir number one aim is to have in aU management
    jobs the most vital, intel ligent, positive and imaginative men we can
    possibly find." F rederick R. K appel , President American Telephone &

    Asa Bushnell, the four-man committee who annual ly award the Lambert Cup to
    the gridiron squad they think is tops on the Eastern Seaboard. Gath ering
    all evidence, arguments, pros and cons together in New York last week, the
    committee made a unanimous decision in picking Bucknell as the best small
    college team around. The perfect 40 point score reg istered by Bucknell in
    the voting was 10 points better than the only other team worth considering,
    Albright. While Albright finish ed with a perfect record, they were "Cheese
    Champions" of their own accord, their schedule was so weak. All season long
    the Bison team received a mini mum of recognition -and on cer- j tain
    weekends they didn't receive a vote in the cup competition. As i the weeks
    rolled by, however, and Bucknell won ball game after j balj game, th^
    quality of the team j became apparent. Bucknell went 6-0 against small )
    colleges. They had one of the finest quarterbacks in the coun-1 try. They
    had the best defense of any small school in the MAC. They rolled up 150
    points to 13 against schools of similar size. They placed four men on weekly
    All East teams, one twice. They finished the season with five wins in a row.

Heading: Idea o f a University
Content: T his year's Religion-in-Life Program was spent in an investigation of what a
    university should be. There are many approaches to this question, but all
    proponents agree that the principle focus of university life should be
    academics. The problem arises when one is faced with the task of deciding
    wnat portion of the university life should be academic. When this senior
    class entered Bucknell in September, 1957,.many aspects of the "Country Club
    on the Susque hanna" predominated. More than ten fingers were nec essary to
    enumerate the Q. C. courses. The number of students who slipped into their
    degrees by the easiest pos sible means, occasionally boosted by some sly
    cheating, was great. Students wTere able to gain an excellent grade point
    average and still have time for a maximum of social life. * Bucknell has
    made many strides during the past three years. Q. C. courses, with the
    exception of a few, have been virtually eliminated. Honors Colloquims and de
    partmental honor courses have been added to the purricu= lum. A host of
    challenging professors have invaded near ly every department, shoving the
    level of academic work to new heights. In general, a sincere and fairly
    effective effort has been made to make Bucknell a first rate school.
    Students have been faced with conflicts: between people and studies; between
    studies and extra-curricular activi ties. Seniors, caught in the transition,
    realize that the minimum amount of work accomplished in lower class courses
    is inadequate preparation for the sort of challenge that now meets them in
    their final year. Freshmen and sophomores, overwhelmed by the staggering
    amount and depth of college work, are also victims of the new aca demic
    squeeze; their high schools have failed to groom them for the jump to
    scholarly research. The pressure is difficult only because we are not accus
    tomed to it. What is most important is that we are learn ing to think.

Content: parroting back information from texts and lectures. Bucknell has begun to
    approach the academic goal, which is the fundamental idea of a university.
    There still exists one drawback to all of these efforts. Granted, Bucknell
    is not in a position to grant many scholarships; however, under present
    conditions we feel that the admissions office ought to make a greater effort
    to get "hungry" students for Bucknell. By "hungry" we mean those that have
    some feeling and appreciation for the opportunities offered them here. On
    the whole, the average Bucknell student will fit into a certain profile. If
    there were a greater effort made to have a more diverse set of student
    profiles and backgrounds, we genuinely feel that the academic situation
    could not help but improve itself. It is time Bucknell had students with
    that "lean and hungry look." i was so excited to read in the Bucknellian
    that bob scott defended our wonderful fraternities fostering an intellectual
    atmosphere here on our own little 300 acres it's been a long time since i've
    been on the "hill" to see the frats in action jny how they must have changed
    it's amazing what this wonderful younger generation is doing for itself.
    come to think of it though the frats really must be sponsoring scholarship
    after all they even seem to have found a new study room down town called
    "Dunkles" a funny name for a study hall i keep hearing the boys courageously
    foregoing movie dates to spend an evening with dunkle a few however seem to
    remain in the fraternity houses i keep thinking that i hear music coming

Heading: THE EDITOR
Content: Dear Editor: On Tues. evening, Nov. 15, a panel of students and faculty dis
    cussed the Idea of fhe University and the prevalent anti-intellect- ualism
    in our society. Dr. Par tridge and Dr. Martin pointed out that the
    University is not the place for vocational training; that it is, or, should
    be, reserved for the intellectual pursuit of the truth. In connection with
    these statements you expressed the opinions that extra-curricular ac
    tivities, including intercollegiate athletics, detracted from this goal.
    Isn't it more likely that the an ti-intellectual attitude has arisen from
    the introduction and the popularity of certain "vocational type" courses.
    For instance, aren't the Pre-med, Engineering, Busi ness Administration, and
    Geology curricular basically non-intellect ual? They are not searches for
    the truth; they are professional training. However, we need medical doc
    tors, we need engineers, we need businessmen, and we need geolo gists in
    this world, for they have a distinct contribution to make. True, a
    university should be an open field for creative listening and thinking, but
    should it not also provide the opportunities for us to put our creativity
    into prac tice? ' Why shouldn't there be student government organizations to
    help develop our society's lead ers, for certainly leadership is needed? As
    Frank Wood said, we need a place to test our wings. Instead of reiterating
    the popular cry of "over-organization," why don't you offer constructive
    criti cism? As was pointed out, anti-intel- lectualism is not unique to Buck
    nell University, but is common to our society. So is over-organiza tion.
    Boys don't play sand-lot baseball anymore, they join the Little League, etc.
    My point is that there is good in these organizations. Why not apply our
    creative thinking to re organizing and offering advice, instead of
    abolishment? Sincerely, Robert A. Scott spectators. They were all taken!

Heading: Nears Goal
Content: by Esther Van Riper With the final results not yet in, the 1960 Drive for World
    Uni versity Service has raised $3214.21 of its goal of $3500. Of this,
    $2393.05 has been received in cash and $821.16 in pledges, which are due
    before Christmas vacation. It is hoped that late returns will make up the
    differences between the total and the goal. The freshmen, giving $1109.80,
    were not far from matching the $1371.36 given by ti\e upperclass men. Of the
    freshman total about 50% was given by men and 50% by women, whereas 60% of
    the upperclass total was given by women and 40% by men. Ap proximately 23%
    of that 40% was donated by fraternity men. The difficulty with which
    students liv ing in town are solicited was stated as one reason why their
    total is relatively low. A division similar to that be tween freshmen and
    upperclass men occurred between the men $1102.67) and women ($1378.49).
    Remembering that all dorms vary in number of residents, npte that Larison,
    Harris, Hunt, Kress, and Swartz each gave between $230 and $295. Roberts and
    East Col lege reported lower totals, and women's houses, especially fresh
    men houses, reported relatively high totals. Ranking high among the fresh
    men houses were Stephens ($80.50), Carey ($67.55), and Leiser ($54.00).
    Walker ($56.00), French ($48.50), and Hulley ($34.00) were the upperclass
    houses having the highest totals. Of the fraternities, DU reported the
    highest total ($92.00), and SPE ($46.80) and SAE ($39.00) ranked second and
    third. Donations from the faculty and administration account for 20% of the
    $3214.21 now collected. There have been good returns from all but one or two
    faculty areas. The WUS committee, pleased with the financial results of the
    drive so far, hopes to reach the goal: allocating $1200 for African
    projects; $1400 for foreign stu dents; $600 for scholarships at Rangoon
    University, and $300 to support Bucknell alumni projects abroad.

Heading: . . .  Red China
Content: (Continued from page 2) a country is to deal with it, not to ostracize it. The
    present attitude of the United States seems to de note sullen hostility and
    nervous anxiety, not strength. 4. We have no obligation to encourage the
    Nationalists in quixotic plans to recapture the mainland, which is what
    present policy does. 5. Might it not be easier to deal with Communist China
    in side the forum of the United Na tions rather than outside it where she is
    cut off from all influence except that of her communist partners? Helmut G.
    Callis has noted that " . . . whether America chooses to recognize the Red
    China regime will not make an iota's difference in Red China's importance as
    a crucial factor in world politics. The point is that Red China exists, its
    government ruling 650 million people firmly controlled by militant
    Communists, its fron tiers sprawling from Siberia to India." Furthermore, we
    must be aware that although the Chinese and Russians are both ruled by the
    Cqmmunists, they continue to be Russians and Chinese with sharp ly different
    traditions and politi cal aspirations. Callis has also stated that "our
    present policy of containment and military pres sure against them
    discourages the growth and expression of any dif ferences which may exist
    between Moscow and Peking." And speaking of differences, the United States
    conflict with China ought not to be confused with American opposition to
    commun ism in general. To return to the original ques tion, admission of Red
    China need not be granted, one author has stated, without some substantial

Heading: Competition, Score One Win
Content: The Bucknell Debate society participated in ten rounds of in tercollegiate
    debates at its second varsity debate tournament, which was held at the
    University of Ro chester, Oct., 18 and 19. During this tournament, the
    society en gaged ift its first international de bate of the 1960-61 season.
    In this round of debate, the Af firmative, represented by A1 De- Prince and
    Dick Boddie, was de feated by representatives of Sir George Williams
    University of Montreal, Canada. The point score was 42-31. The Affrmative
    team was also defeated by Buf falo University, University of : Chicago, and
    Rochester Institute of Technology. The sole win of the Affirmative was over
    the Ro chester Institute of Technology in the second of two debates. The
    Negative, represented by Don Wright and Maurice Nero- berg, was more
    successful at this tourney. This half of the Buck nell team placed-Brandeis
    College and St. Bonaventure in their win column, while dropping close de
    cisions to Case College, Holy Cross, the first place winners oa the
    tournament, and Scranton University. The Society is anticipating a
    successful tournament at the Uni versity of Pittsburgh on Dec. 2 and 3.
    preceded by an understanding of all nations concerned in the Far East as to
    what this quid pro quo should entail. The path toward such an understanding
    is already | prepared by a resolution of the \ General Assembly adopted on j
    Feb. 1, 1952, that in regard to ad- j mission to membership it is not
    possible "to deny candidates the right to present proof" of their I
    willingness to accept and honor I the oblibations of the United Na tions
    Charter. Nations vitally interested in the Far East might | well agree among
    themselves be forehand what kind of concrete proof would be wanted. In
    conclusion, I should like to luote Callis again when he says, "To bring real
    and permanent peace to Eastern Asia without the cooperation of the
    government which rules more than half of the population of this region is an
    impossibility, and politics has al ways been the art of the possible."

Content: Chloe McFeeters was a beautiful coed who majored in psychol ogy and worked in
    the I.Q. testing department of the University. She worked there because she
    loved and admired intelligence above all things. " I love and admire
    intelligence above all things" is the way she put it. Ned Futty, on the
    other hand, wap a man who could take intelligence or leave it alone. What he
    loved and admired above all things was girls. " What I love and admire above
    all things is girls" is the way he put it. One day Ned saw Chloe on campus
    and was instantly smitten. " Excuse me, miss,"  he said, tugging at his
    forelock. 'Will you marry me?" She looked at his duck-tail haircut, his
    black-rimmed glasses, his two-day beard, his grimy T-shirt, his tattered
    jeans, his de composing tennis shoes. " You are not unattractive," she ad
    mitted, " but for me beauty is not enough. Intelligence is what I'm looking
    for. Come to the I.Q. testing department with me."

Content: " Of course, my tiger,"  cried Ned and giggled and smote his thigh and bit
    Chloe's nape and scampered goatlike after her to the I.Q. testing
    department. " First, I will test your vocabulary," said Chloe. " Be my
    guest,"  laughed Ned and licked her palm. " What does juxtaposition mean?" "
    Beats me," he confessed cheerfully and nibbled her knuckles. " How about
    ineffableV' " Never heard of it,"  guffawed Ned, plunging his face into her
    clavicle. " Furtive?'' " With fur on?" said Ned doubtfully. " Oh, Ned
    Futty,"  said Chloe, " you are dumb. Consequently I cannot be your girl
    because I love and admire intelligence above all things." He flung himself
    on the floor and clasped her ankles. " But I love you,"  he cried in
    anguish. " Do not send me from you or you will make the world a sunless
    place, full of dim and fearful shapes-" " Go,"  she said coldly. Lorn and
    mute, he made his painful way to the door. There he stopped and lit a
    cigarette. Then he opened the door and started away to his gray and grisly
    future. " Stay!"  called Chloe. He turned. " Was that," she asked, " a
    Marlboro you'just lit?" " Yes,"  he said. " Then come to me and be my love,"
    cried Chloe joyously. " You are not dumb. You are smart! Anybody is smart to
    smoke Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste which comes
    to you in soft pack or flip-top box at prices all can afford at tobacco -

    minute at Rutgers would have meant an un defeated season. Paul Terhes did a
    wonderful job for Bucknell this year, but the success of" the team can not
    rest on his shoulders alone. Paul was widely recognized for his passing
    prowess, and received an armful of rewards during and after the season for
    his work. He was named All-East quarterback two weeks in a row. He also
    received the Maxwell Award, given by the Philadelphia sports writers. He has
    been named to several "All" teams, including one third string All-American
    team. He was the only player from a small school named on that squad.

    probably the best in small colleges throughout the country. Turk has also
    been of fered a couple of senior Bowl in vitations, and will definitely be
    in Tuscon, Arizona, December 26. While it was his arm that carried the squad
    at times, there was an other factor which contributed mightily to Bucknell's
    cause-- I Defense. Right from the first game, the Bison defense took a
    beating. Don Chaump was the first in a I long string of injuries, which
    eventually knocked four players out for the season. But hard- nosed and
    aggressive, the Buck- j nell line continued to play- out-.;

Content: All the above factors influenc ed the committee's choice of Bucknell as the
    Lambert Cup winner, but there were other fac tors which had a great deal of
    influence on several victories. Take the unsung heroes, Ken Twiford, who
    banged into the line all season for three and four yards and yet was never
    slated as a star. John Aucker and Bob Wil liams, who played as rough a game
    of football as anyone out there, were seldom mentioned. Aches and bruises
    are a small reward for four months of work. Several sophomores played an
    important part in Bison wins. Dick Tyrrell literally came out of nowhere to
    be recognized as one of the best ends in the MAC. Dick Johnson made some
    spark ling open field runs this year, which have been a rarity in the past.

Heading: RUTGERS PREVIEW
Content: Five returning starters, good reserve strength and a number of fine sophomores
    could add up to Rutgers' first winning basketball season since 1948-49.
    That's the opinion of Coach Toni Kuolt and his players as they prepare for
    their opener with Glassboro State here Thursday night (Dec. 1). "We'll be
    going into every game on our schedule with a chance to win it," said Kuolt,
    who is begin ning his second season as a head coach. "I'm hoping that we can
    1 get off to a good start against our I rugged early season opponents."
    Kuolt's optimism is tempered by some problems, but the out look appears to
    be the brightest for a Scarlet team in many years. Rutgers will have no real
    big man, but will possess good overall height. The shooting should be j
    improved over last year, accord ing to Kuolt, and the defense is "adequate."
    Heading the list of returning starters is Captain Doug Patton of Red Bank, a
    5rl0 guard who established one-season Rutgers scoring and field goal records
    last year. Patton scored 495 points for a 19.8 average. A1 Ammerman, a 6-1
    junior from Berwyn, Pa., joins Patton in the backcourt and Lee, Al's 6-4
    brother, is the center. A1 aver aged 14.1 points a game as a sophomore to
    rank second to Pat ton. Lee was the team's top re bounder and was third in
    scoring. The forwards are Karol Stre- lecki of Bethlehem, Pa. and Joel
    Osofsky of Bayonne. Strelecki, a 6-6 senior, led the team in scoring as a
    sophomore but was hamper ed by injuries last year and show ed only flashes
    of his top form. Osofsky, a 6-4 junior, developed during the season to nail
    down a starting spot. Guard Fred Homer, a 6-1 senior from West Hempstead, N.
    Y.,.is a sixth letter-winner back from last year ancl should see
    considerable duty along with forward Bob Strong, a 6-3 junior from Kings
    ton, N. Y. who did not play in 1959-60. Rutgers appears to have more
    starting talent and overall depth than at any time in recent years. Whether
    or not this is the season for the long-coveted winning rec ord should be
    more apparent by the Christmas recess.

Heading: Work Camp Invades
Content: 

Heading: Philadelphia Slums
Content: 

Heading: by Marla Fortman & Kale Kelly
Content: 

Heading: The slums of, Philadelphia con
Content: 

Heading: trasted sharply with our sheltered
Content: 

Heading: Bucknell life when we lived and
Content: 

Heading: worked at a Friend's Work Camp
Content: 

Heading: for a weekend. The purpose of
Content: 

Heading: the camp was twofold: to ac
Content: 

Heading: quaint high school and college
Content: 

Heading: students with the social problem
Content: 

Heading: of slums and to provide a way
Content: 

Heading: to improve the corfditions of .this
Content: 

Heading: segment of our society. Our head
Content: 

Heading: quarters aqd "hotel" was a house
Content: 

Heading: located in the center of the slum
Content: 

Heading: area, where we slept rolled up in
Content: 

Heading: blankets on Army surplus mat
Content: 

Heading: tresses.
Content: 

Heading: Rooms Painted
Content: 

Heading: Our project was to paint two
Content: 

Heading: rooms in a young negro woman's
Content: 

Heading: shabby "band box" (a three story
Content: 

Heading: apartment of three rooms averag
Content: 

Heading: ing about $65 rent per month).
Content: 

Heading: When we arrived at Mrs. Pleas
Content: 

Heading: ant's door complete with step lad
Content: 

Heading: ders, paint buckets, plastering
Content: 

Heading: equipment, and Bucknell sweat
Content: 

Heading: shirts, we were impressed by her
Content: 

Heading: friendliness.
Content: 

Heading: Mrs. Pleasant and her seven
Content: 

Heading: children were supported by relief
Content: 

Heading: funds, and so we were surprised
Content: 

Heading: to find a large and new television
Content: 

Heading: set in the midst of her dingy liv
Content: 

Heading: ing room.
Content: 

Heading: However, upon com
Content: 

Heading: paring notes with the other work
Content: 

Heading: crews, we found that television is
Content: 

Heading: an escape device for these people
Content: 

Heading: and, as such, is a necessity.
Content: 

Heading: Problems Discussed
Content: 

Heading: After our day of hard' work
Content: 

Heading: and first-hand views of slum life,
Content: 

Heading: the discussions with the leaders
Content: 

Heading: and-other work crews were per
Content: 

Heading: haps the most memorable and en
Content: 

Heading: lightening
Content: 

Heading: experiences
Content: 

Heading: of
Content: 

Heading: the
Content: 

Heading: weekend. Topics of conversation
Content: 

Heading: ran from the desperate need of
Content: 

Heading: the slum dwellers for more edu
Content: 

Heading: cation to the ultimate meaning of
Content: 

Heading: education.
Content: 

Heading: Further conversation covered
Content: 

Heading: such topics as time effectiveness
Content: 

Heading: of passive resistance as a fighting
Content: 

Heading: weapon and American student
Content: 

Heading: reaction to government corrup
Content: 

Heading: tion.
Content: 

Heading: Court Session Attended
Content: 

Heading: Sunday morning the group at
Content: 

Heading: tended Magistrate's Court.
Content: 

Heading: The
Content: 

Heading: most pathetic sight was a group
Content: 

Heading: of 14 drunks. Many of the men
Content: 

Heading: had been driven to drinking by
Content: 

Heading: the unresolved conflicts their slum
Content: 

Heading: life imposed on them.
Content: 

Heading: Some of
Content: 

Heading: the men, in advanced stages of al
Content: 

Heading: coholism, begged to be sent to the
Content: 

Heading: state correctional institute, where
Content: 

Heading: they unfortunately would get
Content: 

Heading: little or no permanent help, but
Content: 

Heading: at least would be taken off liquor
Content: 

Heading: for a period of about two months
Content: 

Heading: before they would return to so
Content: 

Heading: ciety.
Content: 

Heading: The other cases ranged from
Content: 

Heading: knifings, mostly committed under
Content: 

Heading: the influence of alcohol, to rob
Content: 

Heading: bery.
Content: 

Heading: It was strange to see a
Content: 

Heading: person of our same age stand be
Content: 

Heading: fore the judge knowing that he
Content: 

Heading: would probably spend the next
Content: 

Heading: 20 years in prison.
Content: 

Heading: The weekend, although it gave
Content: 

Heading: no ultimate answers to the prob
Content: 

Heading: lems revealed, nevertheless show
Content: 

Heading: ed us a different way of life.
Content: 

Heading: Thus, we were encouraged to ex
Content: 

Heading: amine our social system, which
Content: 

Heading: gives people caught in the slums,
Content: 

Heading: little or no way to get out of their
Content: 

Heading: predicament.
Content: 

Heading: Third in a Series:
Content: 

Heading: The World of Richard Fidler
Content: 

Heading: ,
Content: 

Heading: by Dick Fidler
Content: 

Heading: On recent Saturdays, many of you have probably seen me in the
Content: 

Heading: crowd attending the football games and have wondered why I should
Content: 

Heading: want to attend such activities. In this short article I shall try to ex
Content: 

Heading: plain why I like to go to football games and plays. I shall also men
Content: 

Heading: tion some of those sports and other events of a social nature which
Content: 

Heading: those in "my world" like to attend and in which we sometimes even
Content: 

Heading: participate.
Content: 

Heading: Ever since I can remember, I have always enjoyed attending
Content: 

Heading: baseball games, football games, or the like, for I can sometimes enjoy
Content: 

Heading: these events even more than some of my friends.
Content: 

Heading: If the game is
Content: 

Heading: broadcast, I usually carry a- radio to save the person with me much
Content: 

Heading: talking, since he will not have to do as much describing to me.
Content: 

Heading: However, I often attend wrestling matches or ball games without
Content: 

Heading: either a radio or a talkative companion.
Content: 

Heading: I find it quite exciting to sense the emotions which spread
Content: 

Heading: through the stands as the game unfolds before those who are watch
Content: 

Heading: ing.
Content: 

Heading: I am sure that you feel some sort of an emotional effect on
Content: 

Heading: hearing the band strike up a march number, or on hearing a cheer
Content: 

Heading: swelling in intensity throughout the stands. Not seeing what is ac
Content: 

Heading: tually going on down there on the field, leaves a lot of room for
Content: 

Heading: imagination.
Content: 

Heading: Sometimes, however, my imagination will get a little ambitious
Content: 

Heading: and suddenly be halted by the commentary on the radio, or by some
Content: 

Heading: one sitting near me. For example, while describing a play the radio
Content: 

Heading: announcer will often exaggerate what is actually occurring. He may
Content: 

Heading: say that there just has been a magnificent run.
Content: 

Heading: I'll imagine a gain
Content: 

Heading: of many yards.
Content: 

Heading: Then all of a sudden the announced will say that
Content: 

Heading: the gain was for only a couple of yards.
Content: 

Heading: The best example to illustrate the point that there need not be
Content: 

Heading: anyone to describe What is occuring, is to tell you about a typical
Content: 

Heading: wrestling match at the school I attended. Naturally most all of the
Content: 

Heading: audience can not see what is going on out on the mat. Even if some
Content: 

Heading: one is there to describe what is happening, the cheering is so loud
Content: 

Heading: that often they can not be heard. Yet everyone enjoys that emotional
Content: 

Heading: feeling which is built up during a match. Through just the slightest
Content: 

Heading: hint of what is occuring, the audience senses what is happening.
Content: 

Heading: Imagination
Content: 

Heading: The fact that much is left to the imagination can often be of help
Content: 

Heading: in enjoying what is happening, whereas you are at times restricted by
Content: 

Heading: the fact that you know what is happening.
Content: 

Heading: For example, how often have you heard an announcer on a radio
Content: 

Heading: describe something which is overly exaggerated?
Content: 

Heading: In so doing he
Content: 

Heading: builds up in the minds of those listening an image which is probably
Content: 

Heading: quite different from that which is actually happening.
Content: 

Heading: You, how
Content: 

Heading: ever, seeing what is happening, can not be so easily aroused.
Content: 

Heading: I guess the best answer to the question "why do you go to a
Content: 

Heading: football game?" is that I find it just as emotionally exciting as you
Content: 

Heading: do. and that I can exercise my power of imagination.
Content: 

Heading: The same answer would apply to the question "what do you get
Content: 

Heading: out of going to a movie?"
Content: 

Heading: Again I can enjoy myself by trying to
Content: 

Heading: follow the plot and imagining what is happening.
Content: 

Heading: Naturally in a
Content: 

Heading: show such as the usual Western type where the main theme is riding
Content: 

Heading: back and forth across the screen on horseback shooting, I find this
Content: 

Heading: type of show rather dull and very hard to follow. I think
Content: 

Heading: I
Content: 

Heading: am right
Content: 

Heading: in saying that most of you would also find these shows less interest
Content: 

Heading: ing. Why?
Content: 

Heading: Because they are all the same and you know what is
Content: 

Heading: going to happen.
Content: 

Heading: Major Sports
Content: 

Heading: Some of you may wonder what kind of sports and activities the
Content: 

Heading: people in "my world" participate in and enjoy.
Content: 

Heading: The major sport in which we can participate in on an equal basis
Content: 

Heading: is wrestling. I do not mean that "fake" wrestling which one can see
Content: 

Heading: at the eleventh hour of the evening on TV. I know that there are a
Content: 

Heading: number of people on campus who attend high schools which might
Content: 

Heading: have wrestled my school.
Content: 

Heading: Wrestling is the big sport because you
Content: 

Heading: really do not have to see to participate in it fully.
Content: 

Heading: We also swim, do some track events--such as races, jumps, and
Content: 

Heading: shotput, bowl, play baseball and football, and some sports of our own
Content: 

Heading: invention.
Content: 

Heading: For the running events in track, the lanes are marked off by
Content: 

Heading: wires which are used as guides.
Content: 

Heading: The runners half hold on to the
Content: 

Heading: wire as they run. However, most of the good trackmen can run in a
Content: 

Heading: straight line without using the wire. The jumps are done the same
Content: 

Heading: way as you would do them. Naturally there are no running jumps.
Content: 

Heading: Shot-putting is performed exactly the same as you do.
Content: 

Heading: For bowling sometimes there is a guide rail by which one lines
Content: 

Heading: himself up with the alley, but this is not essential.
Content: 

Heading: I and most of
Content: 

Heading: my friends can bowl on a regular alley with no difficulties other than
Content: 

Heading: hitting the pins.
Content: 

Heading: Baseball Methods
Content: 

Heading: We play baseball slightly different than you. Instead of throw
Content: 

Heading: ing the ball in the air, we roll it along the ground.
Content: 

Heading: The batter hits
Content: 

Heading: the ball and then starts running for the base. Sometimes the batter
Content: 

Heading: may have enough sight to be able to run to the base without assist
Content: 

Heading: ance. However, if this is not the case, than he has a "runner," that
Content: 

Heading: is, someone who runs with him to the base.
Content: 

Heading: The fielders field the
Content: 

Heading: ball by sound.
Content: 

Heading: There was one fellow in my class who had no sight whatsoever,
Content: 

Heading: but could run to the bases, field the ball, and peg the ball directly
Content: 

Heading: where it should go. I myself was never that proficient. Actually I
Content: 

Heading: amjiot as athletically inclined as some of my friends.

Heading: Dependent, Who Me?
Content: In the beginning, Bucknell provides each freshman with a counselor. And in his
    senior year, each recipient still clings to every weed sprouting from the
    cliff of an in creasingly complex life. It's not that freshmen should not
    have counselors. On the contrary, for counselors are essential in easing the
    ad justment from high school to college. This adjustment is becoming
    increasingly difficult with the "academic squeeze" as yet uneased by proper
    high school prepara tion. Moreover, the men counselors are invaluable in re
    taining the roofs of Swartz and Kress Halls on weekends. The women
    counselors lend advice about social situations and encourage an academic
    approach. These ends are appropriate. Would that they were merely fulfilled.
    Instead, counselors serve as built-in tu-. toring services, theme
    punctuators and quiz kids. They run handy dating bureaus and maintain verbal
    "dear Abby" columns. The counselor's door is

Heading: always
Content: open; the barest semblance of problems are played upon the coun selor's ear and
    are most frequently solved by that oracle extraordinaire! We do not condemn
    the dormitory counseling system; we merely lament the overplaying of its
    role. Although it varies with individuals, we feel that freshman depend ence
    upon counselors is merely a reflection of an attitude permeating all aspects
    of Bucknell life. -Several years ago, the students rejected an academic
    honor system because they felt themselves incapable of handling the
    responsibility of individual honesty on ex aminations. Since then, the
    cheating problem has in creased in scope and seriousness. Thus, we have
    foisted onto professors a responsibility which is ours. Last year, the women
    students dissolved their social honor system, having proved that they were
    unable to live without falling back on some method of group en forcement.
    Today, they have that enforcement which, in many cases, fails to function
    properly because council as sistants are afraid to accept the duty of
    reporting another woman's violation. Compulsory attendance at classes,
    rather than unlimit ed cuts is another instance of student dependence upon
    enforced regulations. Professors, on the basis of past ex perience, do not
    feel that students are disciplined enough to regulate their own class
    attendance. The fact that the administration requires an attendance record
    for each class further emphasizes the lack of trust in students. Those
    courses allowing independent study are intoler ably few. For most students,
    the nearest approach to scholarly research is a surface-scraping term paper
    con sisting of a collection of footnoted quotations. Seldom are we required
    to exercise our critical abilities; when we must, we find ourselves
    floundering in a sea with which we are not prepared to cope. Dependency is
    an attitude fostered in the home. How sad we do not have the opportunity to
    find our own hand holds, even in our universities. Whee! Whoopie!

    what a tree-- then there's the truly moving - old-testament type santaclaus
    which graces the stately lobby of hunt how it warms my sentimental mouse
    heart the most interesting of all is the truly devout set of seasonal door
    decorations which so perfectly decorate the doors of Hully house rooms and
    the symbolically decorated tree which graced Harris last week.--how they
    echo the bucknellians spirits in.this glorious season all we lack now and
    wont for long is those X-mas formals fraternity greens which remind us
    strangely of the bushes on the odgers mansion or a lewisburgian backyard
    pine-patch how kind the powersthatbe must be to donate all this stuff to we!
    And may the girls of Hulley House bring Christmas near to girls and mouse,

Heading: ON OTHER CAMPUSES
Content: hmiuq With all the recent publicity given to cheating and the methods involved,
    The Syracuse Daily Orange adds a few to the list: 1. The Maxwell Method:
    Take your exam in the last seat of Max's auditorium; pass the exam to a
    confederate waiting outside the window.. Unless he can't read your notes,
    you've got it made--pro viding the instructor doesn't suspect foul play as
    you fool with an open window in five degree weather. 2. The Light-Soled Shoe
    Method: Wear light shoes, write the anwers on the rim of the soles. This is
    a worthless method for near sighted people who must hoist their feet to
    their faces. 3. The ID Bracelet Gimmick: Instead of your favorite profs
    picture, your lift-up bracelet contains .reams of microscopic crib notes.
    Again recommended for people with good eyesight.

Heading: Questionable Measures
Content: 

Heading: Slated for Gold Emergency
Content: by Barry Podber The United States possesses approximately one-half of the known
    gold supply in the world, roughly nineteen billion dollars worth. Despite
    this seemingly adequate supply, in recent months, gold re serves haye tended
    to run out of the country at a greater rate than they entered. Obviously, if
    this situation were to continue, America would soon find herself in a.
    rather precarious position since it is ac tually'the metal that carries the
    worth and not the paper. Realizing this situation and being ably advised,
    President Eisen hower has taken certain steps to cut down the out-flow of
    American dollars. One of these steps has been the ordering of the return of
    military dependents from around the world. Trus, the expenditure of American
    dollars abroad would be cut down by some 500 million dollars. This seems
    like a perfectly logical step, for a military base is not meant to have all
    the comforts, of home. This can be debated in terms of the career soldier,
    but that is not our point here. The U. S. Government has given tacit
    approval to the purchase of the English Ford Motor Company by the American
    Ford Motor Company. A transaction' which will involve the transfer of some
    300 million dollars to Englad. Thus, it seems that the government is either
    very fond of the Ford Motor Companies or is little concerned about the
    welfare of military personnel. Either alternative is unpleasant in its
    ramifications. To add in sult to injury, the depehdents are being brought
    back by private air line, Swiss Air. It seems probable that they could save
    another bit of money by using government transportation. It is a situation
    which, at best, makes one wonder if the government is really "fo r. the
    people."

    eyes of Life's war artists. About 300 paintings by 12 artists will be placed
    on public view. Mr. Mitchell expeats to attend the presentation ceremony.
    Considered one of the most out standing collections of its kind, Life, in a
    special issue devoted to the war paintings in 1945, said-- "Nothing could
    show more dra matically than these paintings how completely the Americans
    have been plunged into the whole wide world." One of the far-flung places
    where the American G. I. was sent was Iran. It was from there that Bruce
    Mitchell captured the work and experiences of the members of the Persian
    Gulf Command in his paintings. Trans porting five million tons of Amer ican
    supplies "from dockless coast across roadless desert and moun tain" was the
    major objective of the servicemen in that area of the globe, and Mr.
    Mitchell's paint ings provide a living and dramatic insight into a major
    military op eration which helped Russia win her battle against the Nazi
    invad ers. When Joel Sayre wrote his book, The Persian Gulf Command, one of
    Mr. Mitchell's colorful paintings was selected for the cover and several
    others were used in a special illustrated sec tion.

Heading: Rutgers, 58-55
Content: With two seconds left to play in one of the'most dramatic bas ketball games ever
    played by BU, co-captain Joe Steiner batted down a desperation shot by Rut
    gers' Doug Patton to preserve a slim 58-55 victory over the Scarlet Knights.
    The game was played before a capacity crowd at the Rutgers gym in New
    Brunswick. As a result of four early fouls committed by co-captain Dick
    Kniffin, Steiner was forced to carry the team's offensive threat, and he
    came through with 28 points. Kniffin finished the game1 with 11 points. Joel
    Osofsky was high man for Rutgers with 14 points. Osofsky started Rutgers off
    to a 2-0 lead with a jump-shot from the foul line. After a foul-shot by Don
    Lampus, Kniffin's long jumper put Bucknell ahead 3-2,- as the lead see-sawed
    back and forth until Bucknell opened up a 12 point advantage with 11:30 left
    in the first half. The lead was gradually whittled down until, with five
    minutes left in half, Rutgers took the lead on a jump-shot by 6-6 Karol
    Strelecki. At halftime, Rutgers led by a slim two point margin, 30-28. After
    employing a tight man- to-man defense in the first half, the Bisons switched
    to a 3-2 zone at the start of the second half. Sparked by Mike Kasnick's
    excel lent floor play and Joe Steiner's shooting, Bucknell took over the
    lead and moved out to a seven- point edge with 12 minutes left in the game.
    With only 2:16 remain ing to be played, BU had extend ed this advantage to
    nine points, 58-49. However, with Doug Pat ton coming off the bench to spark
    them, Rutgers came back with six straight points, and were final ly stopped
    by Steiner's great clutch play. This was the Bison's first win of the
    season, after dropping their opener to Gettysburg. The game was marked by
    the improved play of Mike Kasnick and Kevin Cooney and the continued super
    lative shooting of Joe Steiner.

Content: If the Bucknell basketball team !could walk off the floor at the i end of the
    first half and call it a ! game, they would probably be na- 1 tional
    champions come March. Unfortunately basketball games are 40 minutes long and
    twice this season the second stanza has been the downfall of the Bison
    .team. Wednesday night at Cor nell the Bucknell squad walked off the floor
    with a very comfort able 16 point lead, similar to the 11 point advantage in
    the opener with Gettysburg. It took 18 min utes in the second half, but the
    Big Red altered the score to read 50-48, their favor. Cornell came on the
    floor fol lowing the intermission and pro ceeded to dump in six straight |
    points. Bruce Babich connected I and the rally was stalled tempor- I arily.
    But to the agony of Bison followers the score was narrower . considerably by
    the drivng lay- jups of Cornell'^ Captain John | Petry. A  full court press,
    the de- | fensive manuever which wrecked j the season opener for Bucknell,
    sent the Bison offense into chaos, ! with 12 minutes left. A  three- j point
    play by Petry with seven I minutes remaining put Cornell j !ahead for the
    first time in thej j game at 47-46. Cornell made it | 150-48 before Larry
    Roman con- | nected on a long jumper wjth 17 j | seconds to go. > j When
    Cornell brought the ball j in bounds they worked a play off | j the key
    which blocked out guard i j Ron Ivkovich's defender and he l | waltzed in
    for a layup. With six | I seconds to go Bucknell called j I time, but it was
    too late. Larry | j Roman's desperation shot bounced I off the rim.

Content: Tomorrow night in Davis G y >> the Bison basketball team will be seeking its
    second win of the sea son as they tackle the City Col lege of New York. Thq
    Bisons have been frustrated in two con tests this season as they have blown
    substantial leads early in the ball games. Losing at half time at Rutgers
    last weekend they came out the victor in a hotly contested ball game. CCNY
    has lost two ball games to date, to Wagner and Yeshiva. They play one of the
    weakest schedules of all the teams in the New York area. There was a time
    when CCNY was the number one basketball power in the na tion. They were NCAA
    and NTT champs in the same year. In 1960 they were rocked by the infamous
    "Point-Shaving Scandals" and have never had an important team since that
    time. Apparently their coach feels he is troubling himself by coming to
    Lewisburg. He was quoted as saying, "I'd rather play NYU than Bucknell
    anytime." Despite the fact that the Bisons have lost two, they are one of
    the roughest teams on CCNY's sched ule. The Bisons should win this one, if
    they can overcome big- lead jitters.

Content: Sports Illuslraled's Special Bas- j ketball Issue, out this week, is a bonanza
    for the basketball buff. The magazine devotes 27 pages to I scouting reports
    on 180 college j teams, four pages to a color Spec- | facie on Carolina's
    Dixie Classic j and eight pages to an instruction al article entitled The
    Secret of a i Great Offense which features Ray | Meyer's DePaul team. The
    scout ing reports are divided into con ference groups. Each team and
    individual player prospects are covered, and last year's records are
    included in the background information. In the Ivy League, Sports Illus
    trated finds Princeton the logical choice for favorite. The squad is deep
    and though it lacks size and speed it has consistent man-to- man defense. In
    the MicjrAtlantic Conference, the strongest in the East, St. Joseph's seems
    to be out in front, but LaSalle and Temple are credited with good possibili
    ties. In the Yankee race there is trouble ahead for Connecticut, with Maine
    cited as the team most likely to exploit Conn's lack of size and experience
    this year. Rhode Island's team this year is rated the best in Coach Ernie
    Cal- verley's career at his alma mater and the scouting reports say it may
    challenge the leaders. Independents Among the Independents, Provi dence is
    expected to be up in front again, in the East, St. Bona- venture promises to
    hold its own with Tom Stith shooting, and NYU is taking on the best and is
    predicted to be right up there too. In the Midwest, Detroit, with the help
    of Dave DeBusschere, seems to be one of the most powerful teams in the
    nation, and Dayton looks good, seeming to have everything but a floor lead
    er. In the Far West, Independent Seattle has a deep and speedy squad of hot
    shooters. In the South and Southwest, Florida State and Louisville are both
    expected to improve on last year's records.

Heading: My Year in Pakistan
Content: by Dr. Roy C. Tasker I* regret that so few good Pak istani students, both men
    and women, go on for graduate work to prepare for careers in teaching and
    research. Education is a prime requisite for effective de mocracy, and a
    strong educational system staffed with able well- trained teachers at all
    levels is necessary to produce a literate and intelligent citizenry. What
    more rewarding life can one lead than to teach youth and, by so doing,
    project himself into the fu ture through his students who will carry on the
    torch of freedom and progress! No one is richer than he whose later years
    are filled with the satisfactions of seeing his students succeed in life and
    become true servants of their fellow men. It is heartening to see the
    increasing .emphasis on education for women in Pakistan and the important
    role educated mothers can have in the molding of future generations. My most
    vivid impression of Pakistan is the astonishing pro gress she is making
    industrially, economically, educationally, gov- alike than different and
    that to live and work and play together in the spirit of the Brotherhood of
    Man-is the fulfillment of one of God's great purposes. Part of Pakistan will

    influence, fas cinated us. Khyber, historically and militarily probably the
    most famous place in Asia, recalled events of momentous importance
    throughout past centuries. Swat, that alluring "Garden Spot of Pakistan,"
    enchanted us with its charm. Srinagar, picturesque paradise of painter and
    poet, cap tured our hearts and kindled our emotions. Herappa, Taxila, and
    Mqjienjo-Daro stimulated wonder and imagination. As I sit writing at my desk
    on this beautiful Eid morning, thou sands of devout Muslims are gath ered
    throughout the land for prayers, praising Allah and with gladness in their
    hearts rejoining in the Peace that is theirs and the privilege they have of
    freedom of worship. Herein lies the the as surance of Pakistan's future.

    thought of trying something different, something challenging, something that
    will perhaps affect the course of history, something that you as students
    are best quaified to do? If so, then Oper ation Cross Roads Africa 1961 is
    for you. It is a work-camp:type project founded and led by the Rev. James
    Robinson from New York City. As Rev. Robinson stated when he was here, "This
    is not a tourist sight-seeing trip or a safari, but a face to face
    experience with J Lindsey Merrill, violinist, present- ' ed his first
    recital of the year. He was assisted by Mrs. Martha R. Merrill on the piano
    and Mr. Robert Beckman, clarinet. Mr. Merrill has in the past I given
    consistently fine perform ances, and this was certainly no I exception. The
    contemporary pro- I gram opened with an American composition Four Pieces for
    Vio- | lin and Piano by Quincy Porter. The first, pastorale, and the third,
    Melody, are beautiful, somewhat plaintive meodies. The other two, Scherzando
    and Rondo, are vigor ous>> very rhythmic, thus offering sound complete and
    full in itself. Professor Merrill, in playing the Sonate, again proved his
    technical skill anil virtuosity. The crowning achievement of the evening was
    the Concerto for Violin, Piano, and Clarinet by Bela Bartol, a most excitng
    piece of music. The slow-moving violin and clarinet duets were particularly
    well-blended in tone and tone color. The entire en semble sound, a truly
    difficult thing to perfect in this work, was very fine throughout the
    Concerto. Mr. Merrill is to be commend ed, not only on an excellent re-
    delightful contrasts to the slower, cital> but also on his bringing to
    movements. The Rondo provided | the 'campus much well-written, a brilliant
    finale to the set. though sometimes not-often heard The ensemble sound in
    this first section was excellent. Mrs. Mer rill, a fine pianist, has had
    much contemporary compositions. It is certainly important that we be come

    students have talked about organizing such a club for several years,, and
    the final steps were taken this year. The club officially received ten
    tative recognition for one full year on Oct. 19, 1960 from SFC. At the first
    meeting attendance top ped the 100 mark. Officers, were elected as follows:
    president, Dave Ulp; vice president, Jack Fieck; secretary-treasurer, Carol
    Pope; ski instructor, Marty Holmes; fac ulty advisor, Mr. Loren Bly. The
    club constitution, which several of the club founders had drawn up, was
    ratified at the meeting. The Bucknell Ski Club is very well on its way for a
    successful year. Not only has the club shown very informative and thrilling
    ski movies, but is also making definite plans for week end ski trips and a
    five-day be- tween-semesters ski trip. Ski lessons will be given, afternoons
    during the week if there is suffi cient snow. The club encourages even the
    non-skiers to join. At many re sorts ski rentals are available, as well as
    expert instruction. Don't ' pass up this great opportunity to learn or

Content: This summer, the Bucknell Summer School will sponsor a European travel course in
    art and aesthetics under the direction of Dr. F. David Martin, professor of
    philosophy. Two courses will be offered: Descriptions of Philoso phy 212 for
    undergraduates and Philosophy 312 for graduate stu dents, # Students may
    pursue these ; courses for three credit hours or for' non-credit. Both
    courses will be based on the fundamental experience of meeting our artistic
    heritage in its original setting, so as to bring to life the times and
    spirit that creat ed the greatest artistic values of western civilization.
    Qualified local specialists in the visual arts will meet or travel with the
    group. Each object of art will be related to the artist or artisan, his life
    and character, and the en vironment which inspired or made possible its
    creation. The tour will avoid or minimize the tourist-type of sightseeing
    which covers broad areas in a rapid and cursory manner. The countries to be
    visited are: Italy, Greece, Austria, West Ger many, Switzerland, France, and
    England. Dr. Martin, who will conduct this study-tour, has lived and tra
    velled extensively in Europe. His scholarship, his familiarity with the art
    centers of Europe and his interest in this subject will make this program an
    invaluable ex perience to every participant. A  brochure describing the tour

Heading: Freshman Poet Describes Typical Christmas
Content: 

Heading: A TYPICAL BUCKNELL CHRISTMAS
Content: by a typical Bucknell poet The following poem was especially composed and
    presented by 'Santa Clause' at the Freshman Class Christmas Formal last
    Saturday. 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the sem, Not a
    creature was stirring, not even a gem. The beer cans were hid in the
    stockings with care, In hopes that DEAN STEVENSON wouldn't be there. The
    freshmen were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of frat parties
    swam through their heads. MRS. ODGERS in her nightgown and MERLE in his cap,
    11 Had just settled down for a long winter's nap. When up in the sem there
    arose such a clatter, Even the squirrels wondered what was the matter, f t
    The boys, after kidnapping the campus cop, Were safely nestled on Larison's
    rooftop. The moon on the crest of the new-fallen snow, >> Lit up DEAN MEYN,
    approaching below. i And what should he see as he looked up on high, But the
    freshmen men looking him straight in the eye. With a little old leader so
    noble and plain, He knew in a moment it must be GUY PAYNE. The boys were
    enacting the plans they had made. Terrorizing the sem with a large panty-
    raid. From Edwards and Leiser and Carey and Scott, The boys had some
    panties, as likely as not. The houses had fallen, but, just getting warm.
    These giiys had descended on Larison dorm. Though the windows were locked
    and the doors had ! been barred, The boys didn't give up, their hopes were
    not marred. So up to the rooftop the fellows they flew, Which an extension
    ladder helped them to do. Aroused from their slumber, the girls heard on the
    roof The running around of each sneaker-clad hoof. So they put on their
    robes and went into the hall, As down the chimney the boys started to crawl.
    They were all dressed in disguises, from head to foot, And their clothes
    were all tarnished with ashes and soot. The boys from the quad wore trench
    coats and sneakers, But the other contingent looked quite a bit bleaker.
    They were all disguised with moustaches and warts. And the girls weren't
    quite sure that they came from Swartz. Their eyes had a look that meant only
    disaster. Their laughs were so loud they put cracks in the plaster. They
    spoke not a word but went straight to their work. They took lots of
    stockings then turned with a jerk, And taking some slips and some pants for
    good measure, Ran out of the door, simply beaming with pleasure. They
    thought they had safely concluded their plot, But GRIFF and SPIKE were
    outside in the lot. The boys were stopped dead, most were scared stiff, But
    their fear was relieved when SPIKE and GRIFF, On seeing the loot they had
    lifted from shelves, Decided to take some just for themselves. My story has
    ended; the results were fair, Except some of the women had nothing to wear.
    There's one thing to say of their terrible plight: MERRY CHRISTMAS to all,
    and to all a good night. by T. Hans Russell

Heading: Executive Instrument?
Content: The Bucknell Student Handbook lists the purpose of the Student Faculty Congress
    as follows: . "The Student-Faculty Congress shall serve as the supreme
    executive and legislative instrument for di recting student life at Bucknell
    University; for creat ing cooperation among students, faculty, and admin
    istrators; and for providing democratic student gov ernment in all phases of
    student activity, subject only to the statutory regulations of the
    University. It shall at all times be aware of and concerned with the
    academic welfare of the University and the purposes of Bucknell as an
    institution of higher learning." Few, not even those accused as being as
    negative as we, would endeavor to criticize this purpose. However, our
    difficulty lies in seeing how the present SFC carries out this aim. It is
    not our purpose to judge here the past functions of the organization; rather
    we are concerned only with tlie present. W7e have seen thus far the actions
    of SFC in such significant events as the organization of the Who's Who
    Election and the recommendation that the name of the Parachute Club remain
    the Parachute Club at Buck- i nell University. While these functions must be
    handled and probably do fall to the lot of SFC, the question must be raised
    as to what else this "supreme executive and legislative instrument" does. We
    were temporarily encouraged to find upon the read ing of the minutes of a
    recent SFC meeting that commit tees such as one to investigate the faculty
    evaluations forms and another to investigate a uniform cut system has been
    formed. However, it does seem curious that it has taken SFC until the latter
    part of the first semester to show any indication that it is indeed
    concerned with the academic climate of the University. Further, we have
    ceased to be impressed with the mere formations of such committees. The key
    question is what are they doing? Perhaps there have been other similar
    committees that have been previously formed and have done something
    positive. But if such is the case it has been our misfortune to know nothing
    of their existence, no less their accom plishments. We did see that there
    were not enough mem bers present at the November 30 meeting to vote on the
    "Academic Sub-committee Proposal," whatever that might be, but this evidence
    does little to relieve our doubts. We hope that the picture of SFC, as an
    organization concerned mainly with trivials and delightful unburden ed with
    any significant accomplishments in regard to its primary concern as listed
    in the Student Handbook, that of the "academic welfare of the University,"
    is one falsely drawn. But we do feel that an organization which is given the
    power to judge the relative worth of other student organ izations through
    its allocation of funds, should be subject to some examination itself. If
    this examination yields, as it has in this case, negative results, then
    there is obvi ously something amiss. Either the fault lies in the fact that
    SFC falls embarrassing short of the function it is supposed to fill or its
    channels for bringing reports of its progress to the student body are
    extremely inadequate. We sincerely hope that the latter is the case, rather
    than the former. But in any case: Please SFC would you mind telling us what
    evidence justifies your existence?

Heading: Quality Not Quantity!
Content: We have recognized the "academic squeeze" which has hit this university, along
    with most of its contemporaries throughout the nation. We heartily approve
    the effort to force students to put creative thought into their course work.
    . But let us examine the manner in which this academic emphasis is being
    applied. Nearly every course beyopd the introductory 100 courses, and even
    some of those, re quire term papers. The result is a student pressured into
    completing five or six long papers at the end of the se mester. . The
    obvious answer to this statement is that students should plan ahead. But
    how, we ask, can one keep his head above water throughout the semester and
    still put the necessary brainwork into a thoughtful paper? Stu dents find
    themselves, not of choice but of necessity, merely skimming the surface of

    properly. It may be argued that students must learn to make de cisions
    between extra-curricular activities, social life, and studies. We must learn
    to budget more time for academic work. At the same time, however, we must
    realize that no work may be done effectively if one does not relax oc
    casionally. The human dynamo is able to run for only a short time at its
    greatest speed before giving out. Perhaps one solution to the dilemna would
    be a reduc tion of the number of courses taken in a semester, from five to
    four. In this way, the quantity of academic work may be maintained with
    equivalent quality. Or, we might attempt a trimester or quarter system which
    allows stu dents to enroll in fewer courses and to do concentrated research
    in each. Whatever the solution, the student body cannot learn effectively
    while laboring under the present demands in flicted by professors. The
    number of students on the verge of nervous breakdowns- within the past two
    weeks is far too many for comfort. Vacations no longer serve their purpose
    as breaks in the academic routines, for stu dents are constantly caught
    between the demands of as signments and family activities. In order that the
    faculty receive, the mature and crea tive sort of work of which their
    students ARE capable, we would suggest that professors /consider carefully
    the value and quantity of the work which they assign.

Content: Fellowships for graduate study in Rumanian and Polish univer sities are being
    offered to Ameri can students for the academic year 1961-62, it was
    announced by the Institute of International Education. Applications must be
    filed by Jan. 15. The Rumanian and Polish gov ernments have offered the
    fellow ships as part of exchange arrange ments with the United States, and
    included are tuition and monthly stipends for living ex penses. The Polish
    government will also offer living accommoda tions on the university campuses
    and medical care to those who are granted scholarships for study in that
    country. The U. S.-Rumania arrange ment supplements the awards with travel
    grants, offered by the U. S. Government, and covering the costs of round-
    trip travel, 25 lbs. excess baggage and an allow ance for several days of
    pre-de parture orientation activities in Washington, D. C. Similar grants
    will be made for several recipi- ens of Polish fellowships who have at least
    a Master's degree. Administered by the HE, Hie awards are open to both men
    and women, in any field of study. Candidates must be at least 21 years old,
    U. S. citizens, and must have the necessary knowledge of the country's
    language. While married persons may apply, no funds will be available for de
    pendents' support. Applicants for the Rumanian scholarships should have at
    least one year of graduate training, and a Bachelor's degree is required of
    candidates for the Polish awards. Application forms may be ob tained from
    the Institute of Inter national Education, 1 East 67 St., New York 21, N.
    Y., or from one of the Institute's Regional Offices. U. S. student exchange
    pro grams with Rumania and Poland opened with the current academic year.
    Young people from both countries are now studying in the United States, and
    American stu dents are in Rumanian universi ties for the first time.

Content: *The time has come to make out our Christinas shopping lists, for Christmas will
    be upon us quicker than you can-say Jack Robinson. (Have you ever wondered,
    incidentally, about the origin of this interesting phrase "Quicker than you
    can say Jack Robinson" ? WelF sir, the original phrase was French-- "Plus
    vile que de dire Jacques Robespierre.'' Jack Robinson is, !is everyone
    knows, an anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who was, as everyone knows,
    the famous figure -from the French Revolution Who, as everyone knows, got
    murdered in his bath by Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Aaron Burr. (The reason
    people started saying " Quicker than you can say Jacques Robespierre (or
    Jack Robinson as he is called in English- speaking countries)" is quite an
    interesting little story. It seems that Robespierre's wife, Georges Sand,
    got word of the plot to murder her husband in his bath. All she had to do to
    save his life was call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than she
    could say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram' from her old friend
    Frederic Chopin who was down in Majorca seating lyrics to his immortal
    "Warsaw Concerto." Chopin said he needed Georges Sand's help desperately
    because he could not find a rhyme for " Warsaw." Naturally, Georges Sand
    could not refuse such an urgent request. (Well sir, Georges Sand went
    traipsing off to Majorca, but before she left she told her little daughter
    Walter that some bad men were coming to murder daddy in his bath, and she in
    structed Walter to shout Robespierre's name when the bad men arrived. But
    Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning on the Riviera, and she had
    come home loaded with sea shells and salt water taffy, and when the bad men
    came to murder Robespierre, Walter, alas, was chewing a big wad of salt
    water taffy and could not get her mouth open in time to shout a warning.
    Robespierre, alas, was murdered quicker than you could shout Jacques
    Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is called in the English-speaking
    countries). (There is, I am pleased to report, one small note of cheer in
    this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca where Chopin was setting
    lyrics to his immortal " Warsaw Concerto," she was happily able to help him
    find a rhyme for "Warsaw," as everyone knows who has heard those haunting
    lyrics: In the fair town of TFarsaie, Which Napoleon's horse saw, Singing
    cockles and mussels, aim alive of)

Content: can't imagine why since our stu dent body is notoriously insensi tive, crude,
    and physical, but in any case, it has come. A  group of artists called the
    Mid-State Ex hibitors consisting mostly of fac ulty personnel from central
    Penn sylvania colleges occupy the first and second floors of Bertrand Li
    brary with their versatile collec tion. Mrs. Sterling Strauser offers an
    amazing number of tapestries copied from the antique toys which stand
    underneath her work in the display cases. A  fairly well-known painter, Mrs.
    Strauser shows exquisite skill in weaving and blending colors together in
    painterly fashion. Two of her best works, "Ark" and "Doves in Flight,"
    exhibit this talent. The back and foreground o f the #"Ark" is alive with
    swirls and gyres, a turbulent atmosphere and sea. The ark, however, is
    composed in solid horizontals and verticles, lending it an extreme stability
    in the midst of chaos. In "Doves in Flight," Mrs. Strauser directs the
    movement down two bisecting diagonals which follow the doves' flight. On the

    its color and at the some time extends be cause of its thickness. A  stain
    of dull orange also at the upper left adds the necessary highlight to save
    the painting from complete gloom. John Chandler from Lycoming titled his
    work "Wreath," a de lightful color scheme in which the black that edges the
    perimeter of the canvas gives way to yellow which goes to green and finally
    to red at the center. Harsh, thin, black lines are dispersed through out
    with white 9now spots cov ering the complete canvass. This, as in the
    preceeding painting, is very thinly painted but relies on different
    techniques to accentuate spacial illusions. Another interesting work is
    George Pappas's "Window No. 2" . The predominant form presented is a large,
    black frame painted center, inside of which an amaz- iqg assortment of color
    blocks ap pear. On the left side of the painting, the background is white,

Content: There is no mystery about the modem Christmas tree topped with its bright star .
    . . ablaze with lights . . . and heaped un derneath with colored packages--
    bnt in olden times it was shroud ed In myth. Tor this holiday decoration we
    are indebted to the old Northern European belief that the trees of the
    forest were inhabited by god like spirits. The Germans brought aw>> trees
    into their homes to ap pease these "spirits" and show them they were welcome
    at the Winter Solstice ceremonies. There is also no doubt about the meaning
    of the modem mistletoe, | and what happen to you if you're standing under
    it. But the- cus tom of kissing under the mistletoe ooan.es down to us from
    the mystic rites of the primitive British priests. In their faraway age, the
    mistletoe, which means "all heal," was believed to have magic quali ties--
    the power to heal disease, neutralize poisons, protect its pos sessor from
    witchcraft, and be stow fertility on humans and ani mals. If a young couple
    sealed ih w  betrothal with a kiss under the mistletoe, they would receive
    wonderful blessings and much good luck for the rest of their lives.
    *Wassail' was how they greeted another in Merry Old Eng- laad when toasting
    with a cup of wine. It means to "be whole" or "have health," the answer
    being "drink hail." The word came to mean any liquor in which health is
    toasted, especially the spiced drinks served as a feature- of medieval
    Christmas celebrations That Yule Log blazing on the hearth looks simple and
    provides a wealth of warmth, but the an cients were more concerned with its
    mystical associations than its practicality. The custom was first practiced
    by pagans in Scandina via, where a huge log was set on Are in honor of Thor,
    to mark his festival at the time of the winter solstice. In many parts of
    Europe the dragging home of the Yule Leg is still one of the big events of
    the year and a source of great excitement, especially to the chil dren. We
    modems envision Santa CSaose as a paunchy gent, but in olden times he was a
    complex symbol and many things to many people. Santa descends from the
    original Saint Nicholas, a kindly man who lived in Patara, Turkey, and died
    a martyr in 342 A. D., beonring the patron saint of chil dren. The cult of
    St. Nicholas spread asra>> Europe. He became the patron saint of Greece,
    Holland, and Belgium. Merchant sailors saed his three golden <<purses as a
    device on their guild flags. The Russians passed the good saint to tie
    Scandinavians, at which time lie was still mounted on a white horse
    according to an old tradition of Turkey. ^ut the Scandinav ians knew nothing
    of horses, so they gave him a reindeer-drawn pV<<gVv They also grafted to
    him the legend of the Norse God, Thor, who used to ride through the sky in a
    chariot, and would appear in a red coat for the pagah feast of Yule. In the
    New World, the Dutch called Saint Nicholas "Santa Claus" for short. Our
    modem conception of him comes from the famous poem, The Night Before
    Christmas. Dr. Clement C. Moore, a Presbyterian divinity professor In New
    York State, wrote it to please his children, and modelled << . p hero after
    a little old wizened Dutch gentleman he bumped into one night in 1822--a man
    with red cheeks and white hair, smoking an old clay pipe. Dr. Moore read the
    podegm to his delighted chil dren, then threw it in the waste basket. A lady
    visitor fished it out and printed it a year later in the Troy, New York
    Sentinel. It was an immediate success and flourishes to this day.

Content: by Dick Fidler In talking to many of you, I have discovered that the Bucknell!
    campus is not lacking in the supply of those students who are taking i a
    science course of one kind or another. I have often found myself j standing
    in a sort of a stupor while two or three of these individuals i begin to
    converse about one or the other of the sciences. Unfortu-I nately, I have
    not met as many mathematicians, even though mathe matics is a science. I
    often wish I knew at least a little bit about what the biology student or
    the physics major was talking about. I had courses both j in biology and
    physics in high school, but this is insufficient knowl-1 edge to enable me
    to follow such discussions. However, I thought < that it might be of
    interest to tell you a little bit of the way in which | the science courses
    were presented at Overbrook. If, for fear of running into technical phrases
    and the like in the following paragraphs, you are about to turn to other
    sections of this | paper, I can assure you that your fears are unwarranted,
    for many of the incidents which occurred in science courses were quite
    amusing. The science course which I enjoyed the most was the biology |
    course. The information, naturally, was the same as is given in any I
    biology course of a high school level. Of course, there was one major j
    difficulty; the book which we used was so old that the teacher hadj to make
    use of supplementary material in order to keep the course i up to date.
    Since it cost so much to put a book in Braille, the same book may j be used
    year after year. In the case of the science departments, they # are usually
    the last to receive new books. I hope that someday some-1 one will figure
    out a way in which books can be produced more cheaply and so enable such
    schools to have books which are up to date. Did Experiments 1 especially
    enjoyed the experiments and specimens which we had to do and to examine both
    in biology and physics. The teacher would let us do as much of the
    experiments as was permissible with out putting us into danger. If an
    experiment involved acids, we would do them, but the teacher would handle
    them. We were fortunate in having a complete skeleton which we could
    examine. Each of us learned all the bones and could point them out when
    asked to do so. Every so often we would decide that the skele ton was not
    receiving enough education inside the closet. So v would find some old
    clothes, dress him (or is a skeleton neuter?) and sit him at one of the
    desks with a book before him. One day we did this and put the skeleton in a
    desk in the comer of the room with his face covered. During the course of
    the discus sion, the teacher called on our friend but did not receive an
    answer from him. He was quite surprised when upon walking to the back of the
    room he discovered Mr. Bones sitting quietly absorbing all the information.
    Overbrook's campus is fortunate in having many rarer plants which have all
    been labeled in Braille. We would often take field trips and try to identify
    these plants and trees without looking at 4he signs. There were also bamboo,
    English boxwood, all sorts of roses, and many more interesting plants,in the
    "cloister gardens". (The school is constructed in the form of an old Spanish
    Monastery). I also found physics class very interesting. There were only six
    of us in the class. We had two boys who could see quite well, and so were
    able to do many more experiments than former classes. There were various
    motors which we would take apart and re build. There was a model of how
    atoms are constructed. We had apparatus for distilling and an apparatus for
    separating ^elements. One day the teacher set up the apparatus to make
    hydrogen. He would fill a glass and then drop a match into it. After the
    explosion, we could feel the water which had been produced inside the glass.
    Electric Machines When we were discussing electricity, we made use of the
    electro static machine. We enjoyed the "charges" we gift out of the experi
    ments which were performed with this machine. To demonstrate how a lightning
    rod works, we constructed a cardboard house which we would place in the
    electro-static machine. We would use a bit of inflammable substance to soak
    the roof of the house and then see what would happen when the machine
    discharg ed. Naturally, with no lightning rod, the house would catch fire.
    Oh, the teacher was there with extinguisher in hand. We would then add the
    lightning rod and repeat the process. One remark made by the teacher which
    we all enjoyed would be this: We would be doing an experiment in which water
    would be used. Often he wished to demonstrate that the water would be di
    minished or increased during the experiment. He could easily show this by
    adding a coloring substance to the water. When he did so he would often
    remark: "and now we'll add a little coloring so that (Continued on Page 8)

    1961. Book Review of R. H. Taw ney's T h e Acquisitive Socie ty'. Details:
    Published by Harcourt, Brace and Co., N.

Heading: Y., 1948.
Content: Available at Book store. by Mike Ingraham In his book, Mr. Tawney iden tifies
    the acquisitive society with the capitalistic economic system practised in
    this country at the early part of the century. In this society, wealth in
    the forms of property and money are the meas ure of a man's worth, and there
    fore, he aims at no higher pur pose' than the accumulation of more wealth.
    The workers, who provide a lecessary function, have little or no influence
    in such a society and are exploited to the maximum. Since greed is the prime
    virtue of a capitalist system, all motives are personal motives which can
    only lead the individual away from altruistic acts. Functional Society
    Replacing the acquisitive socie ty with a functional society where the
    individual would be reward ed only for the function he per forms is the
    suggestion of the author. There would be no profit motive because there
    would be no profits. The common need would be the only interest of industry,
    and it would concern itself with producing necessary and beauti ful things.
    The necessary motivation in such a society would-not be reg ulated by greed,
    but by the work er's professional pride in his handicraft and the knowledge
    that he is working for the public good.. All business deals and transactions
    would be honest in order to encourage the people's confidence. Not Idealism
    Mr. Tawney is not so much of an idealist to think that the change can occur
    overnight. He realizes that an "intellectual con version" must gradually
    evolve, in which time the people come to believe in the principles of a func
    tional society. The establishment of such a society would be a slow and
    gradual process. Whether or not we agree with Mr. Tawney's alternatives to
    our present.economic system, we must realize that the dollar god, along with
    the wealthy, functionless leisure class and their misdirec tion of
    production and exploita tion of the workers, must be dis carded if our
    country is to sur vive.

Content: by Nancy Owen Before an audience of students and faculty, a preview perform ance
    of John S. Wheatcroft's orig inal children's play, Ofoti the Troll. was
    presented by the Ac tors' Lab of Cap and Dagger on Dec. 14. Ofoti is the
    story of a young boy who wanders about in search of a troll--a being which,
    he has been told, does not exist. Because of his imagination, how ever, he
    is able to find the troll. Although there Were several satirical elements in
    the * play which held the interest of the au dience, for the, most part
    Ofoti seemed to drag. The actors did not pick up their cues, and seem ed to
    move aimlessly about the stage. It was hard for the audi ence to imagine the
    play holding the attention of a group of chil dren for any length of time.
    Technical Flaws Technical errors also marred the production. The stage
    looked like a cluttered attic, with moving rocks placed in front of a bed
    (which the audiehce was not able to disregard) and a rock door which led to
    a bedroom. Also, the lighting seemed to lack any kind of coherence; the
    lights pop ped on and off areas at random. However, the costumes were very
    well executed, especially those of the turtle and the mermaid. The play
    gained momentum and interest when the ridh man and his entourage appeared on
    stage. Richard Wilsker, as the rich man's secretary, was excep tionally
    funny,- although a bit nervous. His lines were hilarious, and he made the
    most of them. As the rich man, Ron Carey was relaxed and quite good.
    Outstanding Actors Other outstanding characters were John Wilson, who, in
    the title role, dominated every scene he was in, and Jeanne Thomas the wise

Heading: Letters
Content: One of the fundamental rights of American citizens is freedom of speech. It is
    one which we have fought to preserve in a Revolution and two world wars. As
    editors of a college newspaper, we cannot help but wonder why those involved
    in a university do not take it upon them- selves to utilize this privilege.
    We run a weekly column entitled Letters to the Editor, which would be a
    vital ex- change of opinions, were students of a mind to take pen in hand to
    express their views. During the semester, we have printed a number of con
    troversial editorials: Homecoming Traditions, the Function of SFC, the Idea
    of a University, Counseling and Depend ency, to name just a few of these
    subjects. We haye re ceived no written response to any of these challenges.
    During Religion in Life week, a number of intriguing dis- cussions arise and
    opinions were expressed; the sole frui of all was one letter defending the
    fraternity system, which no one bothered to answer. In past years,-a great
    deal of steam has been generated over columns which might be called
    "controversial, pro viding the term was used loosely. One such topic was
    that of the calibre of Bucknell women; it seems that the female ego could
    not take such a beating and that the bruised belles were finally called upon
    to defend them selves. Unfortunately, students do not react accordingly when
    their favorite educational theories are attacked. Or could it be that
    Bucknell students do not have any intellectual viewpoints? We prefer to
    think that perhaps the news paper has failed to challenge those views, that
    are held. But if such is the case, why don't students take it upon
    themselves to advance these ideas in letters, to hold them up for discussion
    and publication upon an ideal verbal battle-ground? > In snooping around the
    campus, even Sam has beard discussions resulting from editorials. But
    somehow tne sound ideas expressed in these arguments never appear m written
    form. Are students afraid to screw their courage to the sticking place in
    order to argue an issue? Or are we lazyrtferhaps it is too much trouble to
    jot down one s thoughts and drop them into the Bucknellian box. Neither of
    these excuses is particularly valid for one who calls himself a student. And
    what of the administration and the faculty? In the last three years, three
    letters, all written by members of the administration, have appeared in this
    newspaper. We like to consider ourselves a community of scholars, but those
    who complain that students do not "think" do not encourage them to do so
    outside of the classroom or an occasional conference. What more exciting
    discussion might ensue than one between students, administration, and
    faculty members on the printed page? In examining the student newspaper of a
    European uni versity, one cannot help but be ashamed that we have no such
    spirited and outspoken comments on subjects such as academic freedom or the
    goals of a university. Lethargy is an infectious state. It reaches the
    critical stage when no one takes the time to express his view point. We can
    only hope that this university, m its striv ing for academic excellence, can
    escape the pitfalls ot a regrettable existence.

    it was announced by the Institute of International Education. Under the
    British University Summer Schools program stu dents can apply for study at
    one of four schools, each concentrat ing on a particular subject and period.
    At Stratford-upon-Avon the subject will be Elizabethan drama; at the
    University of Lon don the course will be the study of English literature,
    art and mu sic of the 17th and 18th centuries, using materials preserved in
    Lon don's buildings, galleries and rec ords; at Oxford the subject will be
    English history, literature and the arts from 1870 to the present. [The
    theme of the Edinburgh School will be the political and economic history,
    philosphy and literature of Britain from 1559 to 1789. Although the courses
    are designed for graduate students, j undergraduates in their last two |
    years at a university will be con- I sidered. -j The inclusive charge for

Heading: A Salute to Gay
Content: With the advent of 1961 will come some changes on the hill. That hallowed hall,
    where no woman dared to tread, will lose its awesome reputation. The
    familiar ring of the pinball machines will be a .sound of the past, and the
    orange and blue motel sign is coming down. Guy Payne, '09. is retiring. His
    career has been a colorful one. The citizens of Lewisburg will not soon
    forget the bitter invectives of his pamphlets against such events as the
    arrival of Dunkle s Mid the birth of Sunday movies. Presidential election
    years have always brought full-page outbursts against the Democrats from
    Guy's vituperative pen. It hasn't been long since Guy stopped riding his
    pranc ing black horse in the annual Homecoming parade. Nor can we forget the
    fact that the revenue from his contro versial pinball machines has provided
    funds to send stu dents to Various conferences of the Christian Association.
    Although Guy Payne's establishment on the hill has come in for its share of
    maligning criticism, we can't help feeling that something will be lost when
    the university takes it over. As 1961 dawns, we find tradition on the wane
    and efficiency replacing it as the means of academic excellence. , We
    recognize that this change is necessary for the func tional, smooth-tongued
    age in which today's college stu dents find themselves.. But it is with
    regret that we bid farewell to the traditions which have endowed this uni
    versity with a spirit of its own. We view the departure of Guy Payne from
    active service on the hill as a symbol of a passing era* With him go the
    last vestiges of the old Bucknell Although we leave behind the color and en
    thusiasm of the past, we greet the rise of a new era with anticipation.

Heading: More Study
Content: With the outside pressure of more students demanding admission than most
    universities can handle, many edu cational institutions are turning to the
    trimester or the quarter system. With the aim of educating as many as
    possible in the shortest time, such a system requires fac ulty members who
    are willing to teach all year round and maintenance of university housing
    and. dining facilities for twelve months of the year. Such a change, while
    feasible for large universities or metropolitan areas, is simply impractical
    for a small pri vately-endowed institution which wants to stay that way. By
    ruling out such a plan, we cancel one of the outlets to the problem of
    quantity overruling quality of student work. . . Before Christmas, the
    Bucknellian printed an editorial discussing the student who "staggers under
    a load of work demanded in greater quantity by each of his professors. A t
    that time we suggested two solutions to the dilemna. "the reduction of the
    number of courses taken in a semes ter from five to four;" and the
    institution of a trimester or quarter system "which allows students to
    enroll m fewer course^ and to do concentrated research in each. Let us
    investigate the first solution as a means to the end desired by both
    suggestions: adequate time for students to accomplish the mature and
    creative work of which they are capable. Under the present set-up, it is too
    much, even for the best students, to enroll in five thought-pro voking
    courses given by five challenging professors^ As a result, one either signs
    up for three "brainteasers, pad ding his schedule with two Q. C. courses, or
    one elects a majority of "easier" professors in order to accomplish the
    required work without cracking under mental and physi cal strain. Although
    both professors and courses have improved in quality, students are forced to
    profane their academic op portunities to the god of time, who devours
    health- intel lect, and achievement indiscriminately. A  reduction in the
    minimum number of hours for a semester would free the student for adequate
    preparation and research in each course. Such a change requires a climate in
    which neither fac ulty nor students will relax standards of academic en
    deavor. A  decrease in courses, however, may also help to create the climate
    necessary for scholastic excellence. W e seem to be approaching this climate
    at the present time, for students, finally able and willing to meet the
    challenges imposed by professors, complain of too little time to do work of
    sufficient depth. In permitting Bucknellians to take fewer courses, the
    success of the venture rests with the students. Are we disciplined enough to
    use our additional time for study or will we merely indulge in more extra-
    curricular activi ties and extended social occasions? As students, we be
    lieve that we have reached a point of discipline and aca demic interest
    which merits a reduction in the required number of hours. ___________

Heading: THE EDITOR
Content: Dear Editor: Having read the article in this Friday's Bucknellian entitled, "We
    Get No Letters," I am in spired to make known my feel ings on this matter.
    Not only are students not writing letters to the editor concerning academic
    and local campus interests, but no one seems to be thinking of the fu ture
    in terms of our government and our democracy. This may sound overly
    patriotic or exaggerated, but after reading up on the present situation and
    what is going on outside our cozy little 300 acres at Bucknell, I real ize
    that this is no longer a vague | nightmare that could never be !true, but a
    real situation that is actually in existence. Russians have been training |
    !800,000 students a year for the last ten- years in concentrated courses on
    spreading propaganda; I propaganda, not in the sense of | lies about the
    United States, but | of the idealistic principles of Communism in its
    realized, fulfill- j 1 ed form. This is not the present j form in Russia
    today, of course, but what they are striving for. | The, Russians do not
    want war j j anymore than the United States | j does, but their goal , is to
    have the I j entire world be Communistic, and they are determined to reach
    this j I goal, eventually. The gains they I have made in the small countries
    ! in the recent years are over- ! powering when compared to the j small
    amount that has been done ! by us. Here is the proof 'of our over- |
    confidence in our position in the | I world today. We sit in all our I 1
    comfort and say, "It can't happen, j j we are too strong." How fast I i can
    the education system in the I United States produce equivalent j men and
    women to those who | j have a ten year start on us,? ; One of the most
    important j threats to us and our lives has j i been occurring gradually
    over the j j past ten years, yet we are so sat- -  I isfied and contented in
    our own narrow lives that we cannot bring !ourselves to do anything,to pro-
    ! tect the security of our country j | and our families in the immediate j
    years ahead. We do not even see [ the threat! Our generation has *never had
    to fight for anything. I We have known nothing but de mocracy and comfort,

Heading: An Inquiry into University Law
Content: by Mike Ingraham The subject of University law has always been a touchy one. The
    prevalent feeling has been and still is one of blind servitude and
    unquestioning obedience. We usually fall into error by betoeymg ' that since
    our attendance at Bucknell is a privilege and not a right, we are under
    strict obligation to submit to any arbitrary whim which the Administration
    enforces; that if we did not comply, we could al ways get out. It is
    distressing to learn how many students hold this identical view when they
    must realize it is archaic, irresponsible, adolescent, and unbelievably
    stupid. For that day is past when any autonomous community, no matter how
    wealthy or influential, can exist outside and independent from the greater
    scope of laws and judgments which regulate society at large. It would be the
    same as to imagine the existence of a feudal barony in the middle of
    Manhattan. The point is this: no law-making body, either nation, state, or
    university, can remain healthy fot any length of time without peri odically
    investigating the precepts behind its legal datum, and in modifying or
    eliminating those laws whose precepts are outdated, un fair, or
    unreasonable. We must remember that the university exists for us and not
    visa-versa, and it is with us that the responsibility lies for its well-
    being. , Unfortunately this has not been the case with Bucknell. Anyone who
    has disagreed with university law has been termed a "smart- aleck" or "wise-
    guy" and refused support; so, many laws which would have been discarded
    decades ago at Harvard or Princeton are still in effect here.' The
    administration should not be blamed since it is primarily a monetary
    organization which by nature doesn't ob ject to any method that increases
    revenue. Let us take an isolated example of University law and investi gate
    its logic. A friend of mine brought his automobile to Lewisburg between
    Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations, and parked it down town off University
    property. A  week later, a Lewisburg police man noticed his out-of-town
    plates and the absence of a University parking sticker, stopped him, took
    his name and reported it to the University police. A  few days later, my
    friend received notice of a $50 fine. It was that simple. The University
    insists that every student who operates a vehicle at Bucknell is required to
    obtain a parking sticker for the fee of $20; a quite reasonable law since
    the school maintains a parking tot and campus roads at its own expense.
    Therefore the premise is that since students use University facilities, they
    should pay for them-- quite right. But in my friend's case, he did not use
    University road and parking facilities; he kept his car downtown. Therefore,
    theo retically, he should have to pay neither registration nor fine (And
    what a fine! A small fortune to the student who can work only three months
    out of the year.) Yet the Administration would argue that without the
    deterrent of registration fee and fine, Lewisburg would be overrun with stu
    dent vehicles. This is a municiple problem which could be resolved in much
    the same way as Bucknell and a hundred other colleges have solved their
    problem, and is beside the question anyway. If, how ever, they insist upon
    this point, the law should be changed to read as follows: "Any student who
    operates a vehicle at Bucknell and in tends to use the facilities provided
    must pay the required fee. and any student-owned vehicle apprehended on any
    University-owned property without said sticker shall be subject to fine."
    This would be a sensible and honest phrasing. .(Continued on Page 8)

Heading: Unique Opportunity for College Studies
Content: A  group of scholarships is available to American graduate and undergraduate
    students for the fall semester at the newly launched East-West Center of the
    University of Hawaii. The grants, most of them for as long as two years
    ($3710-$4310 a year) in Asian Studies and related fields, include an
    expense-paid study tour of the Asian area or country pertinent to the
    individual's spe cialization. Application must be made by March 1 for
    scholarships effective in Sept. Under the East-West Center scholarships,
    juniors and seniors have the opportunity to major in Asian and Pacific
    Studies, while graduate students pursue Asian Studies either in an inter-
    depart mental program or in individual fields, or in the Overseas Opera
    tions Program designed for Amer icans who plan to work in the Asian and
    Pacific areas. The East-West Center, made possible by an initial grant from
    the State of Hawaii and a federal grant of $10,000,000, was conceiv ed as a
    nucleus of free inter change of knowledge and culture among potential
    leaders of Asia, the United States, and the Pacific. Located a short
    distance from the center of cosmopolitan Hono lulu and Waikiki, the Center
    will house 2,000 Asians and Americans together when its building facili ties
    are completed a few years from now. The September en rollment at the Center
    will be 375 scholarship students (300 Asians and 75 Americans). Scholarships
    cover round-trip transportation, room and board, fees, tuition, books, and
    incidental expenses, as well as the Asian study tour. Scholarship applica
    tions may be obtained from the Director of the East-West Center, University
    of Hawaii, Honolulu * 14, Hawaii. These must be com pleted and returned to
    the Direc tor by March 1. Scholarship awards will be announced April 1.

    swam away from the Leopards right from the first gun, as they captured the
    opening event, the 400 yard med ley relay, and then proceeded to take first
    and second in the next five consecutive races. The Bisons tied a pool record
    in the 400 yard medley relay as Clint Condict (backstroke), Chuck Maunz j
    (breaststroke), Skip Cannon (but terfly), arid Frank Wood (free style)
    covered the distance in 4:20.5. Dearslyne Sets Pool Record Co-captain Bill

    yard individual medley and set a new pool record in the process, being
    clocked in the time of 2:28.3. Skip Cannon was second. In the diving event,
    Bob Theiss soared to a first place, cap turing 210.8 points for his efforts.
    Bob's boardmate, Dick Hum phreys took second in the compe tition. Fowler
    Stratton and Robin Harris completed the five event runaway by taking top
    honors in the 200 yard butterfly, Stratton's clocking at 2:39.0. Dearstyne
    found Lafayette's pool much to his liking, as he showed by setting his
    second pool record of the afternoon in the 200 yard backstroke. Bill knifed
    through the water in 2:18.6. The best race of the day was a new Lafayette

    Bison wrestlers knotted up Lafay ette College by a 14-14 count in a hotly
    contested battle last Sat. Each team scored three decis ions and each got
    five points for a pin. Carlos Londono (123 lb. class) of Lafayette scored
    the Leopard's big five-pointer by pin ning Bucknell's Jim Koehn at 5:15 in
    the initial tussle. Then the Bisons began a comeback. Don Knight (130)
    scored a close decision over John Sollenberger of Lafayette by 4-3, and Bart
    Di Chiara put the Bisons in front with a win over Jim  McDevitt. DiChiara
    scored his five points by forfeit as McDevitt was unable to continue because
    of an injury af- I ter the 6:20 mark. After Kalman Csoka was barely |
    outpointed by his foe, 3-2 to knot i the count, the Orange and Blue battled
    to the lead again. Don I Warfel, Bucknell's 157 lb. con tender, easily tamed
    his man by an 8-2 count. Immediately after, # Jon Portnof registered the
    last three points for the Bison matmen 1 by handling his opponent for a 5-1
    decision. John Contarino and Bill Brown j saved the day for the Leopards, j
    as each scored close decisions in I the 177 pound and heavyweight classes

Heading: Mark End of a Colorful, Controversial Career
Content: by Patty Brown Payne '09, Legendary Bucknell Figure, Retires. So read a local
    newspaper article covering this event. The College Inn.and the campus will
    now miss a colorful and controversial character. Guy Payne, now 77 years
    old, told me he'd been working long enough. "What are you going to do now
    that you've retired?" "Oh, I'm going to sleep a while and do some inventory;
    50 years worth of records should keep me j busy for a while." When asked |
    why girls didn't frequent the Inn he told me they used to, back in 1930, but
    then a fire in Old Main stopped classes on the hill. When classes resumed
    the taboo was es tablished: the Bison was for the girls, and the boys ruled
    the Inn. Of ccfhrse, he added, the faculty are steady customers and always
    have been. Noticed Changes "What changes have you no ticed since you've been
    here," I asked. "Well, the biggest change is in the girls. They're a lot bet
    ter looking than they used to be. They're better dressed, from well- to-do-
    families, and I much prefer the modem short hair cuts. Un fortunately,
    they're probably less religious than they used to be." Not wanting to pursue
    the lat ter subject I passed on to boys. "Nowdays they have to study whether
    they want to or not; or they don't stay here very long." As far as
    professors, " we had good scholars in those days, and l i saloons, and sex,"
    to town offi cials "puny policemen, contempt ible cOps, and supine D. A.'s."

Heading: "IT'S HERE-IF YOU WANT TO WORK FOR IT"
Content: Even before Ron Spettino received his engi neering degree from Case he had good
    job offers from six companies. He joined The Ohio Bell Telephone >>Company
    --his reason : " I was convinced an engineer could go further here--if he
    was willing to work for it." As soon as Ron got his feet on the.ground in
    telephone engineering, he was tapped for a tough assignment. The job--to
    engineer switch ing equipment modifications needed to prepare Cleveland for
    nationwide customer dialing of long distance calls. Ron wrapped it up in
    five months, and found he had earned a shot at another tough assignment. In
    this job Ron helped engineer a completely hew long distance switching center
    for Cleveland. This switching center connected Cleveland with the pationwide
    customer dialing network. It was about a year later that Ron put the
    finishing touches on the specs for this $1,600,000 project. Today, as a
    Supervising Engineer, Ron heads a staff of five engineers and is responsible
    for telephone switching in much of the greater Cleveland area. He supervises
    the design and purchase of $3 million worth of equipment a year. And even
    more important, he is charged with developing the technical and managerial
    skills of his staff. Ron knows what he's talking about when he says, " In
    this business you have to do more than a good job. We expect a man to be a
    self-developer. We expect him to take responsibility from his first day on
    the job and think for himself. You don't get ahead around here by just doing
    time." I f  you want a job in which you're given every chance to prove
    yourself, and real responsibility right from the start--you'll want to see
    your Place- ment Office for further information. " Our number one aim is to
    have in all management jobs the most vital, intelli gent, positive and
    imaginative men we can, possibly find." F rederick R. K appel , President

Content: (Continued from page 2) Yet there are those who hold in a seriousness which is
    incredible in:;its short-sightedness that we pay for the "privilege" of
    operating a vehicle at Bucknell. What in heaven's name they mean by "privi
    lege," I have never been able to fathom except possibly in reference to the
    previously discussed "so-called "privilege" of,using University property. I
    am also "privileged" to operate a phonograph and tape ! recorder, so why
    shouldn't I have to pay for that? Isn't it quite absurd to say that I am
    "privileged" to operate aj vehicle which is not owned by the University,
    drive it along roads # not maintained by the University, and park it in lots
    not constructed j by the University? Isn't it time to open our eyes?

Heading: 1961: YEAR OF DECISION
Content: Well sir, here we are in 1961, which shows every sign of being quite a
    distinguished year. First off, it is the only year since 1951 which begins
    and ends with the Figure 1. Of course, when it comes to Figure l 's, 1961,
    though distinguished, can hardly compare with 1911, which, most people
    agree, had not just two, but three Figure l 's! This, I'll wager, is a
    record that will stand for at least two hundred years! 1911 was,
    incidentally, notable for many other things. It was, for example, the year
    in which the New York Giants played the Philadelphia Athletics in the World
    Series. As we all know, the New York Giants have since moved to San
    Francisco and the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City. There is a movement
    afoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix -- the.city, not the baseball
    team. Phoenix, in turn, would of course move to Chicago. It is felt that the
    change would be broadening for residents of both cities. Many Chicago folks,
    for example, have never seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks, on the other
    hand, have never seen a frostbite. There are, of course, certain
    difficulties attending a municipal shift of this size. For instance, to move
    Chicago you also have to move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents no
    great prob lem, what with modem scientific advances like electronics and the
    French cuff. But if you will look at your map, you will find' that Lake
    Michigan is connected to all the other Great Lakes, which in turn are
    connected to the St. Lawrence Seaway, which

    the Atlantic Ocean. You start dragging Lake Michigan to Phoenix andy willy-
    nilly, you'll be dragging all that other stuff too. This would make our
    British allies terribly cross, and I can't say as I blame them. I mean, put
    yourself in their place. What if, for example, you were a British workingman
    who had been saving and scrimping all year for a summer holiday at Brighton
    Beach, and then when you got to Brighton Beach there wasn't any ocean ?
    There you'dbe with your inner tube and snorkel and nothing to do all day but
    dance the Lambeth Walk. This, you may be sure, would not make you NATO-
    minded! I appeal most earnestly to the residents of Chicago and Phoenix to
    reconsider. I know it's no bowl of cherries going through life without ever
    seeing an iguana or a frostbite, but I ask you--Chicagoans, Phoenicians--is
    it too big a price to pay for preserving the unity of the free world? I am
    sure that if you search your hearts you will make the right decision, for
    all of us--whether we live in frostbitten Chicago, iguanarridden Phoenix, or
    narrow-lapelled New Haven--are first and foremost Americans! But I digress.
    We were speaking of 1961, our new year. And new it is! There is, for one
    thing, new pleasure in Marlboro Cigarettes. How can there be new pleasure in
    Marlboros when that fine, flavorful blend, that clean easy draw filter, have
    not been altered? The answer is simple: each time yoq light a Marlboro, it
    is like the first time. The flavor is such that age cannot wither nor custom
    stale. Marlboro never palls, never jades, never dwindles into dull routine.
    Each pack, each cigarette, each puff, makes you glad all oyer again that you
    are a Marlboro smoker! So, Marlboros in hand, let us march confidently into
    1961. May good fortune attend our ventures! May happiness reign! May Chicago
    and Phoenix soon recover from their disappoint ment and join our bright
    cavalcade into a brave tomorrow! (c)  1961 Max ShulauMk * * * The makers o f

Content: Dear Editor: The decision to join a sorority is one which should not be made
    without careful thought on the part of each individual. Since rush week is
    about to begin, I should like to suggest some ques tions which each woman
    who hopes to pledge should ask her self. Have you considered carefully your
    reasons for wishing to join? Or are you someone who has "al ways wanted to
    belong to a sor ority" without knowing exactly why? Before making your de
    cision, have a clear idea of what you yourself hope to gain from !
    membership, and be sure that you

    your soror ity? In the spring, you will have pledge meetings, parties,
    pledge I duties, and initiations. During the j fall and winter, in addition
    to I regular weekly meetings and ac tivities, you will be expected to !
    attend song practice, rush meet- I ings, and rush teas. You will be [ !
    asked to give more time to your I sorority than you realize now. i Can you
    afford to give this time? ] Are you sure you would not pre fer to use it in
    some other way? j At this point, you have a rough j idea of what your
    membership I will cost. Can you afford to spend I this much money? Assume
    that I you held the given amount in j your hand. Would your first i choice
    be to spend it in this man- : ner? If you join, are you prepared ! for the
    other side of rushing | which you will face next year? i During rush week,
    you will see | many women bitterly disappoint ed because they did not
    receive any bids, or because they did not ; get the bid they had hoped for.

    ct of M arch 3. 1879. Dec. 7, 1960 Dear Editor, The opinion expressed in a
    Let ter to the Editor of the Dec. 2nd issue of The Bucknellian about anti-
    intellectual attitudes arising from "vocational type" courses is, to my
    mind, mistaken. The let ter stated that certain vocational type courses like
    pre-med, engi neering, geology, et alia are basic ally non-intellectual,
    that they are not searching for the truth, jand that they are professional |
    training. These so-called non-in tellectual courses, particularly pre-med
    and engineering, are tra ditionally regarded as tough courses. Witness the
    number of students who drop out of these courses. Obviously they require
    superior intellects. Analysing an engineering prob lem requires thinking
    processes no different than those used in analysing the question of the ex
    tent of Germany's guilt for World War I or the existence of God One uses
    facts and the other 'deas. The study of organisms in ire-med is just as much
    a pursuit fter truth as is the study of hu- nan behavior in psychology. Are
    ot both fields of study inquiring ito the nature of life? Pre-med
    #ngineering, et alia are no more rofessional training courses thar are

Content: will be given this year. Try outs for this night club frolic will be held on
    Mon., Feb. 6 at 7 p. m. and Tues., Feb. 7 at 7 p. m. The play centers on
    Joey, a night club MC who has ends to meet. His employer, Mike, runs a
    shabby Chicago night spot, and his circumstances run the same way. Joey,
    however, manages to snowball a blond socialite named Vera, who sees them
    through. She sees through his line as well, but - her leash is long enough
    and her husband is behind doors. Linda is another girl in Joey's life, a
    workaday Chicago secretary, who falls for Joey's line. When the club gets
    back on its feet and Joey is jilted by Vera, there's Linda. Then there's
    Gladys, a showgirl until he topples. Other charac ters seep in and out,
    including a whole slew of showgirls. This menagerie. of Chicago characters
    descended on Broad way in 1940 and presented such a hit that they were
    revived in 1952. About five years, ago Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak, and Rita
    Hayworth were seen in the film version. The musical will be re membered for
    top tunes such as "Bewitcher, Bothered, and Be wildered," "I Could Write a
    Book," and "Zip." A wide range of talents are needed for a production of
    this kind. Those interested in produc tion as well as acting are invited to
    attend the tryouts. Of partic ular importance is a trustworthy occupant for
    the position of busi ness manager. Michael Gavin, a long-standing member of
    the Players, will direct and Joan and Club, the Bucknell Band, Cap & Dagger,
    Men's Glee Club, Orche- sis, the Symphony Orchestra, Theta Alpha Phi, and

Heading: Bisons Split in Southern Tour
Content: A week ago tonight the Bison basketball team won its seventh straight victory,
    99-82 over the University of Virginia. The'one time site of Edgar Allen
    Poe's studies was a morbid one for the southern hosts as Bruce Babich, Dick
    Kniffen, and Joe Steiner combined for 77 points in routing the Cavaliers.
    The Bisons led all the way save a tie at 44 all with 16 minutes remaining in
    the last half. Bucknell, notoriously .slow at the start of second halves,
    per- I mitted Virginia the pleasure of a ! tie only momentarily as they went
    j on to score better than three j points a minute in the time re maining.
    Bruce Babich hit a !career high of 31 points as the j 6-3 senior hit on 80
    percent of his I shots, 14 for 18, from the field. An icy field house in
    Lexington Virginia provided the undoing of a seven game Bison winning streak
    last Saturday night. So cold was the Virginia Military In- | stitute field
    house that the fans in j the stands wore overcoats and I hats as they
    watched the Keydets ! rack Bucknell 101-79 to end a BU | winning string that
    started De- I cember 19. The ice-cold court was ideally | suited for the
    Bison's shooting I that evening, but seemed to have !.little effect upon the
    host team, f a s VMI ripped the nets at a blis- ; tering 56 percent shooting
    aver- j age. As hot as the Keydets were, I Bucknell was cold. Only once j
    during the contest did the Bisons score two consecutive field goals-. Bruce
    Babich led the touring BU !squad With 19 points and 14 re bounds

    of ac- j tion picked up a loose ball under : his own boards and tossed in
    the winning jumper. Bucknell, shuffling its whole j lineup, came all the way
    back| from a 42-32 deficit before Fitzkee j put the game on ice. A  despera
    tion shot by Larry Roman with | three seconds to go fell short and j the
    Bullets threw the ball into the j air to end the game. Roman and i soph Sam
    Penrose were the keys to the Bisons' determined bid for victory-. Together
    they scored 26 of Bucknell's 33 points in the last half. . | Poor
    Officiating Joe Steiner (21.1) kept pace I with his season average as he
    notched 21, most in the first haflf. Joe led the team in scoring and
    rebounds despite the fact that h e , suffered a lot of abuse under the Bruce
    Babich, senior from East boards. The game was very poor- # Rcckaway, N. Y.,

    Gettysburg led the whole way until Larry Roman's jumper from the corner put
    the Bucknell squad ahead 67-66 with 48 seconds to go. The Bisons could do no
    bet ter than a tie until they notched the count at 57 all with 3:20 re
    maining. The Bullets then built this year with four of last season's top
    sebrers to lead the Leopard attack. Now in his sixth year as head mentor.for
    the maroon cag- ers, Davidson is intent upon sub stantially bettering last
    year's 12- 13 record, his first losing season and the first for Lafayette
    since 1941. Davidson's principal graduation i loss was 6-4 Charlie Ross who
    led the team in scoring two years in a row and was also a leading re-
    bounder. Hopes ffoT a winning season this year rest on the hustle and desire
    of the squad, greater speed in the Leopards' fast break and Davidson's new
    zone defense, in stalled to minimize the height ad vantage held by most of
    Lafay ette's opponents. ____________ _____ who averaged 17 points per game
    last season, center "Chip" Lundy with a 13. point average from last year,
    Morris "Red" Boyer, 6-13 forward and most accurate shot on the team, and Bob
    Kauffman, 5-11 guard who hit for 10 points per game last season. Also
    counted on for consistent } scoring power are guards Danny George, 5-10,
    Gene Denahan, 5-10, and Charlie Turk, 6. Slated for extensive' action at
    forward is Gale Schwilk, 6-4. Junior Tom Burns and sopho mores Andy Cook,

Heading: THE ENGINEERS HAVE HAIRY EARS
Content: Today in this age of technology when engineering graduates are wooed and courted
    by all of America's great industries, how do you account for the fact that
    Rimbaud Sigafoos, who fin ished at the very top of his class at M.I.T.,
    turned down hun dreds of attractive job offers to accept employment as a
    machin ery wiper at the Acme Ice Company at a salary of $20 a week with a
    twelve-hour day, a seven-day week, and only fifteen minutes for lunch? I
    know what you are thinking: "Cherchez la femme! You are thinking that Mr.
    Acme, head of the Acme Ice Company, has a beautiful daughter with whom
    Rimbaud is madly in love and he took the job only to be near her. Friends,
    you are wrong. It is true that Mr. Acme does have a daughter, a large,
    torpid lass named Clavdia who spends all her waking hours scooping marzipan
    out of a bucket and staring at a television se$ which has not worked in some
    years. Rimbaud has not the slightest interest in Clavdia; >>or, indeed, does
    any other man, excepting possibly John Ringling North. So how come Rimbaud
    keeps working for the Acme Ice Company? Can it be that they provide him with
    free Marlboro Cigarettes, and all day long he is able to settle back, make
    himself comfortable and enjoy the. filter cigarette with the un filtered
    taste?

Heading: C.
Content: C > o 0 <g> No, friends, ifo, Rimbaud is not allowed to smoke on the job and
    when he finishes his long, miserable day he has to buy his own Marlboros,
    even as you and I, in order to settle back and enjoy that choice tobacco,
    that smooth, mellow flavor, that in comparable filter, that pack or box.
    Well, friends, you might as-well give up because you'll never in a million
    years guess why Rimbaud works for the Acme Ice Company. The reason is simply
    this: Rimbaud is a seal! He started as a performing seal in vaudeville. One
    ni$it on the way to the Ed Sullivan show, he took the wrong subway. All
    night the poor mammal rode the B.M.T., seeking a helping hand. Finally a
    kindly brakeman named Ernest Thompeon Sigafoos rescued the hapless Rimbaud.
    He took Rimbaud home and raised him as his own, and Rimbaud, to show his
    appreciation, studied hard and got ex cellent marks and finished a
    distinguished academic career as valedictorian of M.I.T. Rimbaud never
    complained to his kindly foster father, but through all those years of
    grammar school and high school and college, he dam near died of the heat! A
    seal, you must re member, is by nature a denizen of the Arctic, so you can
    im agine how poor Rimbaud must have suffered in subtropical New York and

Heading: Reviews Experience with The Burma Surgeon'
Content: Safela Editor's Note: We take pleasure in printing this letter from Charlie
    Cargille '56, who is now a senior at Johns Hop* kins Medical School. He
    recently returned from Indonesia where hp attended a medical school for one
    year in order to find out about medical procedures in other countries, by
    Charles M. Cargille '56 You are probably wondering about my trip homo from
    South East Asia, and I wish to share a few of the highlights enroute from
    Indonesia to New York. It was a wonderful experience, and though time was
    short, I saw many places, visiting in mission -hospitals and making friends
    along the way. After leaving Djakarta, I returned to the Medical School in
    Singapore and spent four days with student friends, having the opportunity
    to>>rest and post home several pack ages of gifts from Indonesia. Leaving
    Singapore by train I traveled to Bangkok in Thailand and visited the large
    Adventist Hospital as guest of the staff. Dur ing my brief stay, I made
    rounds and observed in the outpatient clinic. Bangkok was a most enjoyable
    city, and the Christian nurses showed me great kindness. Burma was the
    delight of ,my return trip. After spending several days in Rangoon visiting
    a good friend who formerly had been to my home while studying in America, I
    went to Muse and Namkham on the Chinese border. My friend pr. A1 Lun met the
    bus* at Muse, which is a very small village only 19 miles from Namkham,
    where Dr. Seagrave, the "Buripa Surgeon," works. Dr. A i Lun showed slides
    from his visit to America, and there was much to discuss. His son drove me
    to Namkham by jeep, and it was a thrill to meet Dr. Seagrave for the first
    tiftie. He was playing baseball with the nurses when I arrived. He appeared
    an old man, head bent low, with white hair, and walking with effort. We
    played side by side for the rest of the game as he described the hospital
    and school of nursing, the great medical needs of his area, and the
    character of girls whom he teaches. There are 240 patients and almost 90
    girls in training but only one other doctor to help him, an unbelievable
    work load. For the next ten days was to have the privilege of dining and
    working beside him. Our day began at eight with chapel to which all the
    girls were | invited, Christian and Buddhist. Each morning they read about a
    chapter from the Bible, reading together aloud in a musical sing-song
    Burmese. The Hospital is not a mission hospital, but the kindness! and
    concern, the love which is there translated into action makes it j still a
    dynamic focus of Christianity in Burma. Throughout the! country Dr. Seagrave
    is known as the ''grand old man," and it was I the Burmese people themselves
    who rose to defend and clear him of all false charges during his trial for
    treason in 1950. The effects of I his imprisonment during this time,
    however, are still visible, for it? was a tremendous drain upon his body and
    spirit. Dr. Seagrave taught for four hours each morning. I would ad mit,
    examine, and prescribe for the morning outpatients and new admissions,
    usually eight in number. When the Indian physician there started surgery, I
    joined him to assist on the major cases or handle the minor myself. It was a
    valuable experience in minor surgery to open abscesses, debride carbuncles,
    remove bullets, and assist with superficial lipomas and tonsillectomys. I
    removed one j z tonsil myself and assisted with -the removal of a huge
    ovarian cvst on a patient whom I had admitted and diagnosed. Though Namkham
    is at an altitude of 3000 feet and has a very pleasant climate, it is still
    customary to sleep each afternoon. Dr. Seagrave was forced to live on a
    strict schedule to conserve his en ergy. We parted after lunch and I usually
    studied in the hospital office until coffee time at four-thirty. Then began
    the clinic work with outpatients and the daily review of inpatient progress.
    Since Dr. Seagrave is unable to walk for ward rounds, the tiny Burmese
    nurses get four to a stretcher and carry the patients down to his office.
    There we worked side by side, he translating the history while I examined
    the patient and quickly did a brief physical on the heart, lungs and
    abdomen. I was fortunate enough to pick up an empyema which had been missed
    on admission on a child, and Dr. Seagrave soon said he trusted my ears as
    well as his own and discontinued checking my findings unless I requested his
    opinion. At first we discussed the various interesting points of diagnosis
    and therapy so much that it slowed his work. He is a natural teacher and can
    hardly keep himself from sharing knowledge or swapping stories, and I saw
    many new things to question him about. But soon we- learned to discipline
    our own conversation and worked together efficiently as a team. This was a
    wonderful thing for ,me. In a very few  days I grew in efficiency and speed
    as well as con-, fidence. It was my first chance to do my own therapy with
    drugs j and to perform minor surgery. I saw conditions for the first time--
    !scurvy, typhoid, cerebral malaria, hookworm, and ascariasis. Dr. j Seagrave
    expressed the wish that I could stay to assist with th e! work, and it was
    with deep regret that I left at the end of ten days! to return via Muse to
    Rangoon. From Calcutta I continued on by train day and night, stopping i
    only in Delhi a few hours fo ra  visa enroute to Amritsar. There for the
    second time I visited the beautiful Golden Temple of the Sikh religion, and
    slept outside on the roof of a temple inn, comfortable I on a string bed
    with my mattress, and entranced by the warm beauty j of the Indian night and
    misty face of the moon over Hindu temples, j I crossed the border into
    Pakistan by. foot, went on local bus to ] Lahore, and then by train for two
    days to Quetta, 6000 feet high on [ the Baluchistani desert. It was a
    disappointment to learn in Quetta that the weekly train i to Zahidan in
    Persia had just left, for I was racing across the Middle] East (as fast as
    one cap race by bus and train in the desert) in order | to reach Sweden and
    have time with my friend before sailing for j home on Agust 10. But my
    frustration turned to appreciation. when I came to know | Dr.. Ronald
    Holland, a Royal College surgeon and eye specialist work-1 ing at the
    Mission Hospital there. I spent three days watching and j assisting him at
    operations, making walking rounds, working in th e! outpatient department
    and talking about the medical problems of the | desert peoples. He is the
    most distinguished eye man in that part of the. world and each year holds a
    six-week clinic in the southern part \ of the country to which two American
    ophthalmologists are invited' for training. Together they do 2000 eye
    operations, over 50 a day, mostly for j cataract. During my brief stay, I
    observed more than a dozen o f! thes^e. Without complications, it is a
    simple procedure. With them, j one must be an expert. Dr. Holland takes less
    than two minutes! once the patient is properly prepared. I wondered whether
    a general' physician working, say, in Burma would be able to do such work I
    without specializing in ophthalmology. It seemed as if the blind! had
    nothing to lose and everything to gain from an attempt at oper ation, even
    if the surgeon is not an expert. Continuing on by train, bus* and truck, I
    reached Belgrade, Yugo- FRID AY, FEBRUARY 3, 1961.

    jday, three inches of new powder, and the thermome ter registering a
    tropical 10 above. Skiing was hard, fast and fun on that last day. The new
    skiers of the group after a week of lessons had progressed to the T-Bar
    slope and were doing professional snow plow turns. The more advanced on

    lands<< * I Marcy; the " cocktail slavia, when a most unfortunate thing
    occurred. I had been travel ing with two friends, a Swede and a Pakistani.
    Our train was be hind schedule, and it was necessary for us to switch cars
    to continue on towards Munich, Germany. Suddenly, in the midst of great con
    fusion, everything' went wrong. The most frustrating moment of my life was
    there in the station as I stood watching my train and my friends go off to
    Munich, and one moment later saw my luggage leave for Vienna, while I got
    left in Yugoslavia. Two days later on the ferry to Denmark, I found the
    Swede, who had felt very badly about this, and received from him my sole pos
    session which has survived--a bottle of banana liquor from Turkey, which the
    Pakistani had been carrying for me in his suitcase. Even now it stands on
    the shelf with my books. Thus it was that I arrived in Sweden hungry, dirty,
    cold, fatigued, unshaven and sleepy-- dress ed only in shorts and a white
    shirt-- carrying nothing but a bottle of banana liquor and a copy of Marco
    Polo's Travels, lent to me by an English girl aboard the train in Germany.
    The student sailing from Rotterdam to New  York was good fun. W e had over
    800 students on board. " Several of us spent the days playing chess,
    interrupted only by a series of lectures and discussions bers of the ski
    club scattered 'to various places on Friday. They the Hotel hour" hors After
    having been in Indonesia, Burma and Pakistan and seeing j d'oeuvres that
    served a$ dinner all that a physician must know to practice under those
    conditions, I returned to Johns Hopkins with an appreciation of the
    importance of all our subjects and clinics, even the minor specialties which
    are taken very lightly, but which are of extreme importance to a man in I  j
    Namkham or Sumatra. Studies such as anesthesia, dermatology and j
    ophthalmology--these are exciting to me now because in addition to j any
    specialty I may choose, for more than one Bucknellian on the pay-by-day
    plan; the singing group from St. Lawrence, the Olympic bobsled run where you
    had to sign your life away on a very legal contract-looking paper.

Heading: Challenge: Peace Corps
Content: President Kennedy has recently proposed a program known as The Peace Corps. This
    program involves the sending of volunteers, preferably recent college
    graduates, to underdeveloped countries. These people would com pose The
    Peace Corps. The function of this corps would be to teach and aid in
    political adjustment of newly inde pendent countries. Originally the plan
    was to exempt the members of the corps from the draft, but that provision
    has been dropped. It is a far from glamorous proposition. It would involve
    living in a backward country and being paid a minimum gal ary It now no
    laiiger holds the attraction of draft exemption for young men. The program
    has been conceivted as a contrast to the American habit of aiding foreign
    countries with money, and offering them no practical assistance in the
    running of an unstable country. The Kennedy administration has been
    characterized by the word vigorous. This word sums up the type of people who
    will be* needed to make The Peace Corps a reality. Service in it offers no
    material rewards, and certainly no special recognition. However, it dofes
    offer the chance to do something for America. Since most young men are
    subject to the draft, it will be up to the young women of the country to
    answer Presi dent Kennedy's challenge to get out in the world and work for
    America and her principles. It has been said that America's college students
    are the "softest" ever. This is a chance to show that we have just as much
    spirit and desire, if not more, than our fathers and grandfathers. There are
    a good many seniors who have yet to plot their futures. We suggest that they
    give The Peace Corps seri ous consideration. ____________________

Heading: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Content: everyone else. Before you criti cize the coaches because there art no pegro boys
    on grant-in-aid, ask them about this problem. A boy who is under great
    pressure to meet the academic minimum, and who must give large blocks of his
    time to the discipline of the practice field, isn't in very good condition
    to bear the additional pressure imposed upon him be-: cause of his race.
    Some of ours coaches are honestly unwilling to accept responsibility for
    forcing a negro boy into the difficult situa tion in which he would find him
    self on the Bucknell campus. And that leads to the second reason why we have
    so few negroes at Bucknell. 2. The social reason. The climate of student
    opinion at Bucknell is not as sympathetic to negro students aig it should
    be. Oh yes, there are those here sonal interviews, to ask informa- ion of
    high school counselors, or o know which high school an ap plicant has
    attended. (In our im perfect society, after all, there are those schools
    which are segregat ed--even in the North.), May I suggest that The Buck-
    nellian stop beating the Director of Admissions and settle down to
    intelligent action to correct the real causes for what it rightly views as
    an unfortunate situation. The Bucknellian might start by doing what it can
    to insure a fav orable social climate for the African student who will be
    our guest next year. Very truly yours, John F. Zeller Editor's Note: _ We

    be required to take ROTC? The ROTC department has failed to state clearly
    its policy regarding this question. Could it be that the ROTC depart ment
    fears that answering this question in the open might result in a co-
    ordinated student protest against the fairness of such a pro gram at
    Bucknell? I should hope not. But why, then, have the only statements issued
    from the ROTC department concerning such a program taken the form of sug

    not a technician and is not, we hope, unmindful of the truths of our world,
    whatever these truths may be. Mr. Riley's argument support ing the
    intellectuality of the science student suffers when we observe that few of
    these students use or try to use the scientific pro- dess to establish a
    generablaw of the physical-world. Rather than searching for and establishing
    such laws or truths, they work from laws and truths already es tablished.
    When applied to particles hav ing ordinary velocities, Newton's laws of
    motion are not challeng ed. Indeed, the student is not asked to challenge
    such laws, nor is he asked to search for laws to take their place. His job
    is to assimilate and apply such laws. As Mr. Riley points out, the mor ality
    rate among science students Uustrates the difficulty of this '.ask. This
    mortality rate, how ever, is not a measure of the in effectuality of the
    curriculum, vhere intellectuality, as Mr. Riley las said, is a search for
    "the ruth." It would seem that this efinition admits only students of

    It is the feelings of the English department that the one-act play is more

Heading: HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?
Content: Today let us address ourselves tog question that has long rocked and roiled the
    academic world: Is a student better off at a small college, than at a large
    college? To answer this question it is necessary first to define terms.
    What, exactly, do we mean by a small college? Well sir, some say that in
    order to be called truly small, a college should have an enrollment of not
    more than four students. I certainly have no quarrel with this statement; a
    four- student college must unquestionably be called small. Indeed, one could
    even call it. intime if one knew what intime meant. But I submit there is
    such a thing as being too small. Take, for instance, a recent unfortunate
    occurrence at Crimscott A and M. Crimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant
    valley nestled between Denver and Baltimore, was founded by A. and M.
    Crimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 1706 to escape the potato famine
    of 1841. As a result of their foresight, the Crim scott brothers never went
    without potatoes for one single day of their lives--and mighty grateful they
    were! One night, full of gratitude after a hearty meal of French fries,
    cottage fries, hash browns, and au gratin, they decided to show their
    appreciation to this bountiful land of potatoes by endowing a college. They
    stipulated that enrollment should pever exceed four students because they
    felt that only by keeping the college this small

Content: could each student be assured of the personalized attention, the camaraderie,
    the feeling of belonging, th3t is all too often lacking in higher education.
    Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday a few years ago.
    On this day Crimscott had a football game scheduled against Minnesota, its
    traditional rival. Football was, of course, something of a problem at
    Crimscott, what with only four students enrolled in the entire college. It
    was easy enough to muster a backfield, but finding a good line--or even a
    bad line--baffled the most resourceful coaching minds in the country. Well
    sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota, its traditional
    rival, a capricious destiny dealt Crimscott a cruel blow--in fact, four
    cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback, woke up that morning with the
    breakbone fever. Wrichards, the slotback, was unable to start his
    motorcycle. Beerbohm-Tree, the wingback-tailback. got his necktie caught in
    his espresso machine. Langerhans, the fullback, was stolen by gypsies.
    Consequently, alas, none of the Crimscott team showed up at the game, and
    Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to score almost at will.
    Crimscott was so out of sorts that they immedi ately broke off football
    relations with Minnesota, its traditional rival. This later became known as
    the Dred Scott Decision. So you can see how only four students might be too
    small an enrollment. The number I personally favor is twenty. How come?
    Because when you have twenty students and one of them opens a pack of
    Marlboro Cigarettes, there are enough to go around for everybody, and no one
    has to be deprived of Marlboro's fine, mild flavor, of Marlboro's easy-
    drawing filter, of Marlboro's joy and zest and steadfast companionship, and
    as a result you have a student body that is filled with sweet content and
    amity and harmony and concord and togetherness and soft pack and flip-top
    box. That's how come. (c) '<><>> M>>-* shuima>> # * * You will also find

Heading: Maynard Ferguson's Orchestra
Content: 

Heading: To Feature 'Fire and Drive'
Content: by Gary Langford One week from today, Buck- nellians will have the privilege of
    hearing one of the greatest bands of our time, Maynard Ferguson and hi>>
    Orchestra. Ferguson is considered by many to be the greatest trumpet player
    today. In the Down Beat poll of 1951 hie won the "favorite trumpeter"
    division, and in 1952 the same | honor was bestowed upon him for j his work
    with the Stan Kenton band. In 1959, his newly formed band was chosen as the
    top "New Star Band" in the Down Beat In ternational Jazz Critics PolL His
    policy of "jazz for dancing" has made him extremely popular with college
    dance crowds across the country. . Maynard Ferguson was bom in Canada. He
    started his musical career with piano and violin les sons at the age of four
    at the French Conservatory of Music in Montreal, Canada. Later he studied
    saxophone, trombone and clarinet. It wasn't until he was nine years old that
    he began to study trumpet. By the time he was 15 years old, he was already
    fronting a big band in which many of the members were twice their leader's
    age. Canadian Star Maynard became known as a trumpet virtuoso in Canada long
    before he left for the United States to join Boyd Raeburn's band. It was
    during his period with Stan Kenton that Maynard took the public by storm. It
    rapidly became evident that May nard Ferguson was one of the most remarkable
    technicians on trumpet--perhaps the most re markable in history. Other
    trumpeters had hit notes as high as those Maynard was able to reach. But the
    key word here is "hit"; they could hit that upper register, but they could
    not play there. For whereas with others, such high notes were freakish--
    squeals to be reached and skidded over and then drop ped--Maynard was able
    to work comfortably and accurately at that register. The Kenton band had
    parts written especially for , Maynard, because no one else could play them.
    j One of the memorable sights i in jazz was to see Maynard, with ! Kenton's
    Innovations in Mddem j Music orchestra, sitting in the !trumpet section,
    casually playing I impossible parts without turning ! a hair or revealing by
    any ges ture that what he was doing was 1 almost unbelievable. As Stan
    Kenton once said, "There are few trumpet players !that are able to create a
    feeling i of fire. We're lucky to have one: ! Maynard Ferguson." It was
    inevitable that Maynard j would form a band of his own. j And, after a stint
    as a studio mu sician in Hollywood, he did--in j 1956. Classical Trumpet
    Maynard is one of the most ver- ! satile musicians to ever step into the
    spotlight of big-band jazz. !After gaining proficiency on the I trombone, he
    laid it aside to con- i centrate on trumpet. But in re- I cent years, he has
    been playing j 1 the instrument again, both valve I and slide trombone.
    Perhaps the | I high water mark in demonstra- j I tions of Maynard's
    versatility j came last year when he was fea- | tured as soloist with the
    New j York Philharmonic in William | rtusson's Symphony No. 2. The New York
    critics, used to I the limitations of classical brass I men, were astonished
    by Maynard j t --perhaps mystified is the better j j word. For, as little as
    25 years | I ago, such a symphony could not i !have been written; no one
    could; ! have played the trumpet part. Maynard's Band There is one feature
    about May- ! nard's band that distinguishes it ! from all others. He us.es
    only 12 i musicians, excluding himself. This | number is possible because of
    i Maynard's ability to fill in on one I of his three instruments: He has !
    stated his reason for using 12 men | instead of the usual 18. "In the I old
    big band days it was not un- ' common for an 18-piece orchestra ; to have
    only two or three good ' soloists. Now, nearly all the i young jazz
    musicians want to ex- ! press themselves. Thus, having I a band with live
    trumpets and four trombones means that there will be some unhappy musicians
    because there would not be I enough time to solo. The most I important job
    for a band, how- | ever, is its section work and en- ! semble. I find that
    12 men can !give me the "bigness" I want and II can operate better at very
    fast ! tempos when it comes to swing ing because essentially it's lighter
    than larger orchestras." Using the works of Willie Mai den, his arranger,
    one of his tenoi saxophone players, and Slide Hampton, one of his trombone
    players, Maynard's band plays with a fire and drive uncommon ! to most
    other/ big bands.

Heading: Displays Excellence
Content: by Joanne Harris This past Sunday evening af forded an hour of musical enjoy
    ment for the many who attended the senior organ recital presented !by David
    Lyon of Elmira, New !York. Mr. Lyon's performance | displayed a mastery of
    technique I ! as well as a musical understand - | ing of the composition and
    the j instrument. The program opened with the 1G minor Prelude and Fugue by
    | Bach. The majority of the Pre- | | lude provided an excellent open- i !ing
    for the program. In the | Fugue, Mr. Lyon's registration I ! permitted the
    listener to follow j j the intricate form of the composi- | j tion with
    comparative ease, j In the B minor Chorale by Caesar Franck, Mr. Lyon showed
    j I particularly well an understand- j ing- of the expressive elements in
    the music. Again through thej performer's effective registration j and
    articulation one was aware of I the theme throughout the com- position. The
    third section of the pro-1 gram included the contemporary ; selection Pavane
    from Robert El more's Rhythmic Suite followed j by Variations on an
    Original! Theme for Pedals Alone by Wil- | liam D. McRae, chairman of the !
    ; Department of Music. Mr. Lyon's ] : performance of this last unusual j i
    composition displayed a great. | mastery of pedal technique. The final
    selection, Prelude and | Fugue by Marcel Dupre, was per- ; haps the most
    enjoyable as well : as the most difficult on. the pro- | gram. The problem
    of coordina- | tion inherent in the fugue appar- i ently caused Mr. Lyon

    Giraudoux's Amphitryon 38; was a successful collegiate at-1 tempt at
    sophisticated drama. Toj do justice to this intellectually profound, yet
    highly comic play, a great deal of comprehension as j well as competence is
    requisite, j However, we must view the Cap j and Dagger presentation as a
    work accomplished by undergrad-1 uates, and, not by a professional acting
    group. Probably, the most praise- worthy element of this production was its
    technical achievement. The sets designed by Nancy Dia mond were not only
    effective in creating the illusion of vast depth, but also very appealing to
    the eye. The background scene appeared to be painted on a filmy material |

    offset by shades of sky-blue. Plaster Cloud The Deus ex Machina plaster of
    Parie cloud-contrivance was an # ingenious, if not wholly success- ! ful,
    idea. Jupiter and Mercury arrived safely at the land of mor tals by cloud,
    but were apparent ly unable to get off the ground at the close. Another
    interesting technical scheme was the utter dependence on lighting instead of
    curtains to indicate the opening and closing of scenes. As a result, the
    audi ence was never rudely divorced from the anthropomorphic and mortal
    masqueradings, The frolicsome Jupiter, played by Landis Coffman, is
    enlightened j by Alkmena, the epitome of mar ital fidelity, portrayed by
    Nancy Diamond, on the human concepts of love, friendship, and trust. The god
    of the sky is introduced to the effect of mortality on love, as opposed to
    his own blase and elemental notions about sexual relationships. Indeed,
    these puz zling confrontations cause the god to develop a wrinkle on his
    brow. Jupiter's Sidekick Sandy Schumacher's fine por trayal of Mercury,
    Jupiter's mis chievous sidekick, evoked a good deal of laughter from the
    audi ence. His timing and inflection were excellent. Hans Russell, as
    Trumpeter, also provided the au dience with mirth. Cathy Olerio I proved
    herself to be "a \jiatural !and a competent actress in her j performance as
    Leda. Joe LoGrippo, as the cuckholded i Amphitryon, and Marv Kahan, as !his
    servant Sosie, were sufficient for their parts. Gay Pulley, as , Kleantha,
    Violet Dun worth, as Nenetza, and Ron Carey, as War rior, were adequate in
    supporting roles. Although his facial expressions were excellent, Landis
    Coffman could have done more with his voice. Nancy Diamond succeed ed in
    portraying Alkmena as a strong-willed and noble aristocrat, but her
    performance would have been improved by more practice with voice pitch and
    tone. In general, Amphitryon 38 was ! enjoyed by those who attended the
    production. However, aside from a few high spots in the act- | ing, the
    staging and scenery were ; the most commendable features. The production
    staff can rest as- sured that all of their hard work was worthwhile. Alcohol
    and gasoline do not mix on the Bucknell campus.

Content: by Caryl Burton The CHALLENGE- committee has instituted a series of informal
    pre-cohference seminars as a means of acquainting interested students with
    the pro's and con's of many national and internation al issues. Each
    Thursday at 4:30 p. m. a student leader starts the discussion by presenting
    a paper summarizing the research he has done on the topic for that week.
    Members of the group contribute the various comments presented in leading
    journals of the day as well as the new thought they have developed on the
    subject. In the first of the seminars, Bill Kopit presented an excellent
    paper, a commentary upon the collection of essays written by ten outstanding
    American leaders en titled National Purpose. The Bill of 1832 or the
    American Civil War is termed "catastrophic". Even "industrialism" is
    attacked as if it were some new liberal fad, and, indeed, anything which di

Content: From Burke lo Santayana by Russell Kirk; Regnery (Chicago, 1953). $6.50. In this
    highly 'controversial book, Mr. Kirk has reviewed' the writings of a
    selected group of British and American thinkers since 1789 and defined their
    po litical and social tendencies as conservatve. As for himself, Mr. Kirk
    strong ly advocates a conservatism in the tradition of Burke based on a
    religious view of the world and human life and respectful of prejudice in
    morals and prescrip tion in law, as the products of social experience under
    Providen tial guidance. Anything which interferes with the steady flow of
    History as the English Reform principle binding man in social j action but
    which has great force." And "It is not true that increasing misery
    inevitably^ means revolution--^certainly not a democratic revolution." These
    remarks are as democrat ic as they are Socialist and offer no emotional
    basis for any great mass movement. As the author writes, "I have assured no
    class, race, or nation of" its own perfec tion or its messianic destiny."

Heading: Show First Semester Counts
Content: A university student's first se mester grades give a better indi cation of his
    ultim ate success than either his high school rank or his score on an
    examinaton. That's a tentative finding of a study of grades of former
    college students being made by

Heading: F.
Content: Chandler Young, assistant dean of the Col lege of Letters and Science at the
    University of Wisconsin. The first phase of a long term research effort, the
    study des cribes the scholastic progress made by 4,000 new freshmen who
    entered the University in Septem ber of 1950 and 1951. Dean Young cautions
    that the conclusions "have not as yet been rigidly test ed." "The student's
    record after he gets to college tells a much better story than pre-college
    data," he explained. Usng College of Let ters and Science men as an ex
    ample, Dean Young said that the 305 who earned a "B" average in the' first
    semester progressed bet ter than the 305 ranked in the top 10 per cent of
    their high school graduating dlass and better than the 305 who scored iri
    the top quarter on the American Council Psychological Examination. "Among
    the most promising students at the end of the sopho more year, 90 per cent
    of the 305 who made a 'B' average the first semester were present and 70 per
    cent were-earning 'B'; for the 305 selected on the basis of high school
    rank, 83 per cent were present and 60 per cent were earning 'B'; for the 305
    selected by the ACE score, 78 per cent were present and 58 per cent were
    earning 'B'." "Similar results were found for the least promising students,"
    he added. Dean Young suggests that a student does not need a whole year
    after high school to become accustomed to university life. | While the
    finding held true for I both men and women, there were I differences in
    their progress. I "Men persist longer than women," # he said. Some 44 per
    cent of the ; men completed eight semesters 1 and only 35 per cent of the
    women | finished eight consecutive semes- i ters. But, more women than men I
    earned "B" grades. No need to be, really. If thoughts of life insurance
    planning bring a cold chill to your bones, you aren't thinking in the right
    direction. Starting an adequate life insur ance program now, while you're
    still at college, gives you a head start on the future. Provident Mutual
    offers a variety of plans with guaranteed savings and pro tection features;
    only through life insurance can you buy such a combination in one package!
    We'd like to tell you more about these flexible plans which are now

Content: Student government at Bucknell has, for many years, been a subject of general
    dismay, but in 1958, there ap peared on the scene an idealistic student who
    bfegan writ ing letters to leaders of various organizations asking them what
    they were doing-- a most impertinent gesture. In a minor campus revolution
    this atypical individual was elected president of the Student Faculty
    Congress. His administration managed to eliminate the modest stipends given
    to such persons as editor of L'Agenda and the Bucknellian, to start cleaning
    up the cumbersome and send some individuals to other schools for discussion
    of common problems and to bring back suggestions. His successor, an unknown
    independent and a dark horse, car ried on in the same spirit, completely
    eliminating the. so cial committee and turning decisions on such problems
    over to the personnel deans, streamlining the methods of distributing
    student funds and implementing one sugges tion 6f the previous years' group
    which had visited other schools by establishing a system of student
    evaluation of faculty.

    lacked a percep tion of its role as well as initiative in pursuing it. Al
    though a resolution has been passed to create a committee of students to
    advise the SFC and the Dean of the Univer sity on academic matters, the SFC
    this year has had little concept of anything else to do. Its major activity
    has been the revision of an overly bulky constitution by elim inating one of
    the two bodies that compose SFC. It is to the credit of the present SFC that
    it is elijninat- ing some governmental machinery that is not needed and that
    it has passed the proposal for an academic committee. There are, however, a
    number of things which discredit it. The officers of SFC have failed to
    carry out the annual leadership conference held each September at Cowan,
    which is the only major opportunity for all student lead ers to assemble as
    such and to consider generally and specifically the problems of the
    University. They have failed to distribute the forms for student evaluation
    of faculty that were devised by the previous administration. Their publicity
    has been negligible, even less than merit ed by the little they have to
    publicize; they, ha ve given the campus even less of an idea of thei?: work
    than they have allowed themselves. In a month and a half, they have failed
    to answer a scathing Bucknellian editorial that pointedly asked them if they
    were doing anything. The purpose of this editorial is *to point out that

Content: Feb. 14, 1961 Dear Editor: After observing the issues, ar ticles and motivations
    of Buck- nellians for the past three years in the Bucknellian. and after
    reading the editorial of February 10, which was written by my close friend,
    Mr. John F. Zeller, I find it now necessary to speak for my self concerning
    this most import ant matter of racial discrimina- tioi#at Bucknell--
    specifically that situation involving Negro students here. Mr. Zeller has
    made many good points and here I feel that I should stress this, but I feel
    that I can speak about the subject of how a Negro reacts to our uni
    versity's situation somewhat bet ter than all others here excepting Frank
    Wood. I have often been deeply moti vated to write an editorial about the
    situation here at Bucknell, such as after the cross burning, after my
    rejection from Evans Tavern because of my color--not because of athletics,
    age, or the many rationalizations which came about by our fellow students,
    and after the many small incidents which have unjustly occurred in j ested
    now. It is not for. an ad ministration to assume the emo tional or social
    adjustment of a qualified person. Let him make his decision. I feel that if
    the points which Mr. Zeller stated were inserted into the Bucknell Bulletin,
    an incoming student would know, and then if he ac cepts the situation as I
    have, he will not be (shocked by the gen eral attitude here. The statement
    was made that there should not be discrimination for Negroes as there should
    not be discrimination against Negroes, for quite some time. It is pres ent.
    Is aiding a Negro in at tempts to get an education at Bucknell
    discrimination for--? Should all funds for Negroes be done away with Ymder
    this as sumption? This would be valid if thefe were no discrimination, but I
    feel that the situation is so bad that it is time someone start- or all
    colored colleges are miss ing the entire point. As far as athletic grants-
    in-aid are concerned, I have observed this. Negro athletes would come here
    if offered these grants, but they are not offered these grants for it is
    felt that he must be an Olympian, for if he s^ts on the bench, people would
    call Bucknell prejudiced. He must be a poten tial Phi Beta Kappa, as are all
    Bucknell athletes on grant-in-aid, and the coach would not' want a fellow to
    go through these trials and tribulations. With this atti tude there will
    never be a Negro on Bucknell's football nor basket ball teams, and I feel
    that there are many "tan" fellows in the areas mentioned above who could
    qualify in all respects for an ath letic grant. Not all Negro ath letes want
    the big "subsidizing" institutions with easy courses. order . . .

    future leadership? Mr. Zeller gives two reasons why there are fewer Negro

    the following frofh on top.) Fair enough! However, it ill behooves us to
    hurl any verbal blockbusters at the students who are at the present time
    trying to do something for greater toler ance on the campus. We are go ing
    to need "Liberals" and "Intel lectuals" of all varieties to carry such a
    program into effect. Of course, there are some among us who interpret democ
    racy as the right to hate anyone of another race just as much as they please
    . . . Something like the small town Southern mer chants Carl Sandburg tells
    about, the first of which opened an em porium with a large sign: "100%

    picture and religion on applica tions was removed, the doubt here would be
    lessened. New York State and Massachusetts ask that all institutions therein
    refrain from such measures, thus they see the need, why can't we? Mr. Zeller
    has asked whether any inquiries have been made to the Admissions Committe as
    to how many Negroes applied for admission in the class of 1964, and how many
    were offered admission but elected not to come to Buck nell. Yes, I have
    made inquiries and I also have met some quali fied Negro students in other
    col leges who have in the past desir ed to attend Bucknell but were rejected
    for various reasons. One problem that I have found is that the majority of
    Negroes do not know about Bucknell at all, for Bucknell'has not been
    presented to them. Also, the high schools from which many Bucknellians came
    have many substantial Negro students who would like to come here--for the
    education which we pride ourselves in be ing able to give, and as a chal
    lenge so' to speak--but they are not approached. To cite examples of these
    high schools let us look at the schools in Westchester County and Long
    Island in New York, East High School in Rochester, New York, Aliquippa,
    Pennsylvania, and Pittsburgh High Schools, Elmira, (N. Y.) Free Academy, and
    the Philadelphia area schools. I am sure that there would be at least one
    person qualified jn  all re spects and desiring to attend Bucknell in the
    past two years, and I know there are those inter- to light two sides of a
    very cru cial problem at Bucknell. By far there are more than just two sides
    to the problem. I do not agree with Mr. Zeller's reasons explaining why.
    Bucknell is a rather undesirable place for ally since they are offered as
    rea sons why there are not more Negroes here. I have been at Bucknell for
    four years and can proudly say that these past four years spent both on and
    off Buck- nell's campus, but greatly domin- ment upon two points--social and
    economic--as the reason for the lack of Negroes at Bucknell, dis missing the
    Admission aspect entirely. Here I will say that there are some tacit
    assumptions which should be cleared up by someone in the midst of the situ
    ation--Dick Boddie. Many Negroes are of the middle and lower income
    brackets, but many are of the upper brackets and would send their children
    here, knowing the situation--for there are others who think as I do. In
    order to change the whole American aspect it is necessary for parents to
    send their children here knowing how things are. We are not searching for an
    easy way out, but we are striving to let ed ucated persons accept us as edu
    cated equals. Many Negro parents disapprove of all Negro colleges for the
    reason it is sin escape from the reality of the "American way" . ' After
    visiting it St. Paul's College in Virginia, which is' all Negro, except for
    hree professors and the Pepsi Cola man, I know that all white Yes, because
    if there were more Negroes on the Bucknell team, these fellows would, be
    less prone to do these things. I agree fully with Mr. Zeller's suggestion of
    havihg the Bucknellian start by doing what it can do to insure a favorable
    climate for those "foreign" students who are here now and this will be an
    accom plishment in itself. The most embarrassing situa tion I find that I
    have encounter ed from my years at Bucknell, is the reaction that so many
    persons have shown when I tell them that I am one of two or three Negro
    students at Bucknell University (population approximately 2,400), Lewisburg,
    Pennsylvania. Yours truly, Richard B. Boddie Feb. 14, 1961 Dear Editors: I
    trust that every Bucknellian has read John Zeller's vigorous expose of the
    appalling lack of democracy on this campus. He contends that students would

    panic and get nasty. Nor is answer them. Most important, as far as our
    country's welfare is concerned, is why, if Bucknell is unfriendly to the
    Negro student due to student attitudes, the Adminiistration has offered a
    scholarship to an Afri can student? An American Negro if rebuffed here will
    leave being anti-Bucknell. An African stu dent will leave being anti-Ameri
    ca and a prime receiver for com munist propaganda. Does the favorable
    publicity for Bucknell involved in this scholarship justi fy the permanent
    feeling of hos tility with which the African must leave if conditions are as
    Mr. Zeller has painted them? Does he feel that whereas there is a need Xd
    educate African lead ers there is no need to educate True, all aspects of
    campus life : are not freely open to a Negro, but by far neither are all
    aspects ' of society outside of Bucknell freely open to Negroes. Nearly j
    every Negro, by the time he has ! reached college age, has experi- i enced
    at least one door slammed i in his face because of his race. To be told that

    after having made arrangements to rent an apart ment over the phone, to
    arrive at the apartment and hear the owner mumble with astonishment and
    partial embarrassment, "I'm sorry . . .  I didn't know . . . we are all
    filled up". I doubt rather seriously whether last Spring's Cross Burning
    would frighten away any Negro appli cants of the caliber Bucknell re quires.

Content: by Marie Monsen India today is at a moment of crisis in her experiment of growth
    in freedom. Her second great Five-Year plan is nearing com pletion and plans
    have been drafted for an even larger, more I demanding third Five-Year Plan,
    j All the world, and especially the | new nations of Asia, are watching
    India with serious concern. With a population of 450 million, India is
    second in Asia only to China | with 600 million. Together these I two
    countries comprise one-third of the total world population. This fact alone
    points to the im portance of internal growth and development in India and
    China for the rest of the world. More- j over, the world today is divided
    into two powerful blocks led by j the United States and Russia. The new
    Asian nations, in the j ferment of nationalism and indus- j trialization,
    are looking for lead- j ership within Asia, and more spe- j cifically, are
    examining critically : the progress made by India and China. Both India and
    China are under pressure to produce results, not only to strengthen their
    own nations, but also to gain leader ship in Asia. China, under Com munism,
    is making great progress in industrialization, literacy and in improving
    agricultural output. Sukarno of Indonesia, U Nu of Burma and other Asian
    leaders are impressed with this progress. The hope of the non-communist
    world lies with India who has ehosen Socialism as her means of growth and
    development. Five Year Plan The most challenging aspect of j the third Five
    Year plan is the community development program j of, in Indian terminology,
    " the < public sector of the economy" . India's socialism has been criticiz
    ed both by Western capitalists who do not understand the com plexity of the
    problems which she faces nor the force of tradi- , tion among her peoples
    and >>by j the Communists who claim that Communism is more efficient.
    Although India's progress has been marred in the past by many mistakes, her
    leaders have shown J a remarkable disposition to bene- j fit from these
    mistakes. Foreign Aid The determining factor in the success of the new Five
    Year plan is foreign aid. India cannot j possibly complete her new 'large'
    plan without foreign capital. This | is the challenge with which the free
    world, and especially the United States and Britain, is now faced. Will the
    United States un- der the Kennedy administration | <<<< increase aid to

    ures of socialism in India's second j Five Year plan as well as the fu ture

    impact of Afri- j ca's awakening upon the modern world. The flowing tide of

Content: With the cost of dating rising higher and higher it is no wonder that so many of
    us men are turning to discus throwing. Natur ally. we would prefer nuzzling
    warm coeds to flinging cold disci, but who's got that kind of money? Prices
    being what they are, the average man today has a simple choice: dating or
    eating. Unless the average man happens to be Finster Sigafoos. Finster came
    to college with the normal ambition of any average man: he wanted to find
    the prettiest coed on -campus and make her his. He looked long and
    carefully, and at last.he found her--a tall job named Kretchma Inskip, with
    hair like beaten gold. He asked her for a date. She accepted. He appeared at
    Ijer Borority house that night, smiling, eager, and earning a bouquet of
    modestly priced flowers. " Now then," said Kretchma, tossing the sleazy
    flora to a pledge, " where are we going tonight?" Finster was a man short on
    cash, but long on ideas. He had prepared an attractive plan for this
    evening. " How would you like to gp out to the Ag campus and see the milking
    machine?" he asked. " Ick," she replied. " Well, what would you like to do?"
    he asked. " Come," said she, "to a funny little place I know just outside of
    town." And away they went.

Content: The place was Millionaires Roost, a simple country inn made of solid ivory. It
    was filled with beautiful ladies in backless gowns, handsome men in dickeys.
    Original Rembrandts adorned the walls. Marlboro trays adorned the cigarette
    girls. Chained to each table was a gypsy violinist. Finster and Kretchma
    were seated. " I," said Kretchma to the waiter, " will start with shrimps
    remoulade. Then I will have lobster and capon in maderia sauce with
    asparagus spears. For dessert I will have melon stuffed with money." " And
    you, Sir?" said the waiter to Finster. " Just bring me a pack of Marlboros,"
    replied Finster, "for if ever a man needed to settle back and enjoy the mild
    benefi cence of choice tobacco and easy-drawing filtration, it is the
    shattered hulk you see before you now." So, smoking the best of all possible
    cigarettes, Finster watched Kretchma ingest her meal and calculated that
    every time her fetching young Adam's apple rose and fell, he was out another
    97(i. Then he took her home. It was while saying goodnight that Finster got
    his brilliant idea. " Listen!" he cried excitedly. " I just had a wonderful
    notion. Next time we go out, let's go Dutch treat!" By way of reply,
    Kretchma slashed him across the face with her housemother and stormed into
    the house. " Well, the heck with her,"  said Finster to himself. " She is
    just a gold digger and I am well rid of her. I am sure there are many girls
    just as beautiful as Kretchma who will understand the justice of my
    position. For after all, girls get as much money from home as men, so what
    could be more fair than sharing expenses on a date?" With good heart and
    high hopes, Finster began a search for a girl who would appreciate the

Content: The Debate squad, fresh with victory at Johns Hopkins last week, dropped below a
    .500 rec ord for the second time in seven tournaments this season at the
    Eleventh Annual Kings College Debate Tournament. Thirty col leges from eight
    states and the District of Columbia competed for both team and the
    individual speaker's trophies. Karen Heske, John Werner, Howard MacDevit and
    Fran Malik accumulated a record of four wins against six losses. Miss Heske
    and Werner were victorious over Syracuse Univer sity mid Mansfield State
    College. It is interesting to note that in the three times Bucknell has
    faced Syracuse this season, the Bucknell team came out as victors in each
    round. In the later rounds the Affirmative team dropped close decisions to
    Lehigh University, Fordham University--each by one point--and Norfolk
    College of William and Mary--by four points. MacDevit and Malik of the the
    timely issue of health insurance also completed a 2J3 record. Rose- mount
    College and Scranton Uni versity fell against the Bucknell verbal offensive
    while Wilks Col lege, Norfolk College of William and Mary, and Roanoke
    College received the later decisions. It was grim consolation for the final
    tally to show that Dartmouth College, an old rival of Bucknell in the field
    of friendly persuasion, captured first place. Marywood College and Wilkes
    College re ceived second and third places, respectively. * * * The Beta

Content: by John Minsker Swimming in friendly waters for the third time this season, the
    natators of Bucknell University splashed to a 53.5--41.5 decision over the
    yniversity of Pennsyl vania last Saturday. The 'Bisons opened up a quick
    lead and then held on for dear life as the Red and Blue swim mers captured
    seven firsts in the 11-event contest. Although Bucknell has hurt themselves
    in recent meets be cause of their inability to capture the relay events this
    was not the case on Saturday and proved to be the margin of victory. The
    Orange and Blue opened the meet by besting the Philadelphians in the 400 yd.
    medley relay. Bill Dearstyne (backstroke), Chuck Maunz (breaststroke), Skip
    Can non (butterfly), and Frank Wood (freestyle) covered the distance in
    4:09.5 giving the BU Bisons a 7 * lead. Harris, Cannon Score Robin Harris
    and Skip Cannon added four more points to the Bisons score by taking second
    and third spots in the 200 yd. butter fly while Dan Etenger and Dave Ulp
    were also two-three in the 100 yd. freestyle event. Ulp shared his third
    position with Dick Rice of Penn. Co-captain Bill Dearstyne, got the BU
    aquaen on the winning track again in capturing his spe cialty, the 220 yd.
    backstroke, in the time of 2:21.8. Clint Condict added three more valuable
    ponts by splashing 4o a second in the event. Bill Plater took his second
    blue ribbon of the afternoon for Penn in the 440 yd. freestyle, but the
    Bisons took second and third with Bill Dorr and Bob Ayers respec tively
    doing the honors. . Then Penn forced the meet to a climax as they pulled to
    within five points at 46.5^-41.5 in the semi final event, the 200 yd. breast
    stroke. Walt Monahan set a new pool record for the Red and Blue with a
    2:33.7 clocking. Chuck Maunz took third for Bucknell. In the concluding
    event, the | 400 yd. freestyle relay, Bucknell needed a victory in order to
    cap ture the meet. The team of Dave Ulp, Dan Etenger, Bob Ayers, and Bill
    Dorr triumphed for the BU Bisons in the all important event in a near record
    time of 3:38.8. The victory upped Bucknell's water log to 5-2. Penn Takes
    Five Firsts Bill Dorr and Bob Ayers swam one-two in the 220 yd. freestyle as
    BU upped it's early margin to 15-1. Dorr's time was 2:19.0. Then Penn
    captured five consecutive first places which left the Bisons with an
    uncomfortably narrow 33.5--27.5 lead. Only because they took second place in
    each of these events were the BU swim mers able to hold on to their slim
    margin. Leo Rota began Penn's domi nance by capturing the 50 yd. freestyle
    in a fast 23.8. Dave Ulp took second for the Bisons. Then Bill Slater, a
    member of Cana da's swimming team in the recent Olympics, streaked to a pool
    rec ord in the 200 yd. individual med ley in the time of 2:17.9. Bill
    Dearstyne set a Bucknell record while coming in second with a 2:24.4
    clocking. Bob Theiss and Dick Hum phreys took second and third re spectively
    in the diving event as Theiss soared to a school record as a result of
    capturing 67.20 points. Lloyd Mitchell was the winner for Pennsylvania. The
    Bison basketball team won its tenth game of the season last Frday night when
    they stopped the Westminster Titans 91-82 at Davis Gym. Big Hal Smoker rip
    ped the cords for 34 points, season high for a Bison, as Bucknell Western
    Pennsylvania by the squad. "Big Smoke" connected on 15 of 20 tries from the
    field and add ed 4 of. 5 shots from the free throw line. Th? 6-6, 230 pound
    sophomore from Columbia, Pa., also pulled down 17 rebounds, second high
    total for a Buckell player this season. Bruce Babich, hitting on 10 of 13
    shots from the field, \collected 25 as Joe Steiner was held to 8 points
    below his average, netting 13. The visiting Titans outshot the Bisons 51% to
    ,49% with each team taking an equal number of shots. Bucknell wrecked West
    minster' hopes of a seventh straight win on the foul line, by sinking 23 of
    25 charity tosses. The visitors Ron Galbreath, 6-1 senior, from Wampum, Pa.,
    threw in 17 of 27 from the field and scor ed on all six opportunities on the
    free throw line, to tally 40 points. It was the best scoring exhibition by a
    viisiting player this year, but four points short of the floor rec ord set
    by Jesse Amell of Penn State. Smoker's performance was three points shy of
    the Bison mark of-37

Content: The Bison basketball team plays host to one of the top teams in the country next
    Wednesday night when they take on the St. Joseph Hawks from Philadelphia.
    The Bucknell team, despite the advantage of the home floor, will be rated
    underdogs to a team that has won 18 games and lost 4. The highly rated Hawks
    have pulled some of the most stunning upsets of the season with victories
    over St. Johns, Wake Forrest, Seton Hall and Villanova, but have blown some
    easier contests to Pitt and Dayton. The big wheel in the St. Joe's machine
    is 6-6 Jack Egan, who has been averaging about 23 points per contest. The
    confident senior from Bethlehem, Pa., hit a season high of 47 against Gettys
    burg. Vince Kempton, 6-8, "The roost unproved big man in the city of
    Philadelphia," according to the newspapers in the Quaker town, will rattle
    the backboards for the tournament bound birds. Along with these two giants
    the Hawks have been getting a lot of mileage out of several outstanding
    sophs. Billy Hoy, former Philadelphia high school standout, has been
    averaging 14 points a game as a first year man, hitting a season high of 30
    points against Seton Hall. Moy, 6', will be assisted by 5-8 Jim Lynam, who
    won two ball games for the Hawks early in the season via somee deadly
    shooting at the free throw line. Tom Wynne, 6-5, is a capable replaee- ment
    for Kempton, despite his rookie status. The 220 lb. native of Chester, Pa.
    has started about a third of the Hawk contests. Three lettermen, Frank
    Majew- ski, Paul Westhead, and Harry "The Glove" Booth, will see ac tion
    Wednesday for this powerful squad. Majewski has been a con sistent starter
    and scorer, while Booth is acknowledged as one of the toughest defensive men
    in the MAC. Two years ago an even stronger team crushed a magnificent Buck
    nell squad centered around big I "Moose" Danzig, before some 30001 fans.

Content: 

Heading: Some Bright Places Saved The Show!
Content: by Janet C res wick Shaw's Candida, presented by The Cleveland Play House last
    Friday, gained comic momentum very slowly, and in some cases painfully. The
    audience was ex tremely small and somewhat scat tered, and this may have
    inhibit ed the performance during the first act when the players and the
    audience were mutually unre sponsive. Candida, the wife of Rev. James
    Morell, is the wise and witty, eminently Shavian female, who mothers and
    masters two men and then asserts her right not to choose between them. Adale
    O'Brien is consistently good as Candida. When she enters for j her first
    scene her red hair and j regal bearing seem to shatter Shaw's maternal
    character but throughout the play her tone and timing and gestures bear out
    Shaw's original. She is not as I genuinely comic as the other characters in
    the play but she is undoubtedly the springboard for all their highest humor.
    Morell's Role Morell, her husband, condemns Candida's mild realism, terming
    her judicious perspectives 'un comfortable realism'. Eugene! Marchbanks, a
    potential poet and Briton smitten by Candida, never i realizes that Candida
    catches the | core of his 'poetic truths' and sal- j vages his insights from
    his melo drama. Richard Oberlin, as the H cv-1 erend James Mavor Morell. is
    weak throughout the play. His I timing was often bad though his j facial
    expressions, when they were well timed, were quite funny. Poor Canting A
    really good Morell should at least be able to cant convincingly, and Oberlin
    couldn't even cant. Fortunately. Burgess, Candida's father, was ably played
    by Robert Gaus whose timely buffoonery and multiple moans salvaged sev eral
    scenes. Gaus plays the part of the splendid old un-gentleman with high good
    humor,and elo quent gestures from start to fin ish. His pompous polish was
    dire- ly needed in the .first act where he carried the comedy almost
    singlehandedly. Lynn Storer, as the Reverend Alexander Mill, has little to
    say but says it well and was general ly well-received by the audience. Sally
    Noble as Prossy, Morell's secretary' often missed the comic mark by
    overacting. Her open ing scenes drew scarcely a smile, In fact she was
    rather like a piece )f over-wrought iron throughout the first act. Prossy
    mellows ap preciably in the first scene of the second act where she tries to
    save her self-respect despite March- banks insistently romantic analy sis of
    her spinsterhood. Shavian Poet Richard Halverson as Eugene Marchbanks is
    strangely moving, strangely funny as a Shavian Poet. He was a much stronger
    character than I had expected, though not quite a Ricky Ticky Tavy. His
    facial expressians and lack of facial evpressions account ed for half of his
    tremendous ap peal once Halverson began to fill his role. After the first
    act Hal verson becomes a first rate Marchbanks, a poet with both feet
    planted firmly in mid air, grasping vaguely at the truth and unfailingly
    misunderstood, an apostle . of sweet spontaneous grief. by. Janet Creswick
    Volpone, Ben Jonson's 'loveless comedy,' was reworked by Stephan Sweig, who
    abridged, condensed, and translated the original five acts into a three-act
    production for the German stage. Stephan Sweig's adaptation sacri fices
    three of Jonson's secondary characters, Sir Politic Would-be, his wife and
    Peregrine. In the original, these characters furnish sub-interest and
    occasional relief after several intensely evil wife selling scenes in 'the
    main plot. I think the loss of these charac ters not altogether
    'unfortunate: their scenes were too mild to ade quately relieve the evil
    tenor of the main plot. Stephan Sweig compensates in I part for the loss of
    Lady Politic i Would-be with the addition of !Canina, a fast, loose and
    single j sister. On the whole Stephan ! Sweig maintains the massive I
    contrapuntal texture of the orig- | inal Volpone, though much of j Jonson's
    splendid diction is lost in the German version and not ! recovered in re-
    translation. Animal Fable Feigning fatal illness, Volpone, !childless and
    wealthy, draws I drooling, gift-bearing, ' legacy | hunt.ers to his bedside
    where they console and commend him in the hope of post-mortem profits. Mos-
    ca, Volpone's parasitic partner, 1 ably deludes each prospective ;heir into
    bringing lavish gifts to j insure ?reater final gain, keeping each blindly
    inflated by his own prospects. Voltore (Vulture), Corbaccio (Crow) and

Heading: Of Works in Senior Recital
Content: by Bev Anderson , On Sunday evening, the largest audience to attend a senior
    recital in quitie a while responded en thusiastically to the most artistic
    piano performance of Anne Rut ledge. The program opened with | the
    impressive Bach Toccata in C j minor. In the stately introduc tion, the
    performer achieved a | very rich and sonorous effect, j She seemed in close
    rapport with the fugue; the theme projected itself delightfully through the
    | I surrounding interwoven voices, i Chopin's tragic Sonata in B flat | :
    minor gave vent to the more ro- i j mantic nature of the performer. | I The
    listener Was. carried along in | | the sweeping development of the i themes.
    However, Miss Rutledge at times seemed to become a bit I too percussive in
    the intensity of | her absorption. This was pri- j j marily due to the
    extremely poor j acoustics of Vaughan Literature j Auditorium. In the
    intermittent lyric pas- j sages, she achieved a most d e -! | lightful
    supporting blend with the ! ! lucid melodies singing out in j j beautifully
    moulded phrases. The j performer demonstrated great i ! technical
    proficiency in the final ' presto, as well as showing expert use of the
    pedals throughout the program. Hindemith's 1922 Suite tor Clavier opened
    with a dissonant, saucy march. The Nachtstuch af forded a quieter contrast
    to the more percussive, jesting mood of the work, which the performer and
    her enthusiastic audience ob viously enjoyed immensely. Her teacher, Miss
    Dorothy Wilson, has indeed helped to mold this su perior talent into an
    outstanding piano performance. The varying aspects of the contrasting num
    bers all pointed to Miss Rutledge's superior musical understanding; her
    excellent technical abilities served to enhance the musical ideas. Bus For

    Scholarly Kent Smith, former * board chairman of Lubrizol Corp. j and acting
    president of Cleve- j land's Case Institute of Technol- j ogy, said quietly,
    "We've got j three choices: one, let the Com-1 mupist countries surpass us;
    two, i let the federal government take j over higher education; or three, j
    provide from private sources the money to develop the skills that | will
    keep us free and continually j .improving our way of life.'' "Any real
    American is for num- j ber three," Dively exclaimed. "Let's figure what to
    do about it --and do it together!" What they figured out, after months of
    discussion with other corporate heads in Cleveland, was a unique plan for
    aid to education that could serve as a model for every corporation and
    community j i n the land. The " Cleveland com- j pact" is the soul of
    simplicity-- and equity. It proposes that its: signers agree to "corporate
    con tributions commencing at once and increasing within three years to a
    minimum of one percent of income before taxes, and there- after gradually
    increasing as the need develops." The powerful potential of this simple
    agreement is seen in the | fact that, under the compact, the I first 21
    signers alone will produce j more than two million dollars a year for higher
    education. Should corporations generally follow | Cleveland's lead, more
    than a half i billion badly needed dollars would ; flow annually into'our
    needy col- leges and universities. Though no publicity attended | the plan's
    inauguration, news of I the Cleveland action soon spread. The Board of
    Governors of Asso- j dated Colleges of Indiana--a pioneer organization in
    promoting aid to education--began consider ing ways of applying the Cleve-1
    land idea to the whole state of | Indiana. Other communities con sidering
    action are Cincinnati, St. j Louis, Dallas, Omaha and Worces- | ter, Mass.
    The genius of the Cleveland j Compact is threefold: it pledges all to move
    together; it puts every j corporation, large and small, on j the same "fair
    share" footing; it j leaves each signer free to do as he pleases with his
    corporate gift. Companies are asked only for a | "moral commitment" ; there
    is no j group supervisipn or meddling, no | attempt to dictate ^ or suggest
    i where or how a corporation's gift | is made. leges: "Higher education
    creates our markets--an educated public | and a high standard of living Ngo
    hand-in-hand ; it trains and sup-. plies our future executives; its re
    search develops new products and processes." With evangelical fervor they
    laid it on the line: "Our colleges can no longer de pend solely on the
    charity of pri vate individuals struggling under current tax loads. If we as
    busi ness corporations default on our obligation, forcing huge govern ment
    spending to fill the need, we'll pay the bill anyway--via taxes. And that
    way we'll pay more!" * Corporations Cooperate To a sizable number of Cleve
    land corporations such arguments have been convincing. Besides the 21 who
    had signed up by No vember last, many others, with the endorsement of
    management, were awaiting final action by their boards of directors. Charles
    E. Spahr, president of The Standard Oil Co. (Ohio), whose philosophy is
    shared by his board of directors, says, "There's no such thing as continued
    pros perity for a company like ours in a declining America. Keeping the
    country educationally strong is a vital interest of American busi ness." In
    the first months of the com pact's existence, 11 of the signers were already
    giving their one per cent or more: one was up to three and a half percent,
    another to four. "You get the habit," says J. B. Perkins, president of Hill-
    Acme Co., manufacturer of ma chine tools, " and it grows on you!" ! New
    Partnership The new partnership between j business and education has in -1
    volved far more than the giving of money, the Cleveland group | will tell
    you. Most of the signers j have become active on the boards of the colleges
    in which they are interested, helping the adminis tration in numerous ways
    And in the case of one large company, faculty members of the institu tions
    it supports have made fre quent visits to * the company. "This interchange,"
    says the com pany president, "has resulted in deep friendships and a deeper
    un derstanding of each other's world." How do the Clevelanders allot I their
    contributions? In addition j to earmarking gifts for scholar- | ships,
    faculty salaries, support of i professorships and basic research, ! new and
    imaginative ways of giv- i ing are being discovered. Matching Plan ! ' One
    popular scheme is the | "matching" plan, in which a firm j matches any
    employee's contribu- i tion to his college up to, say. $1000 i a year. And
    one Cleveland com- j pany has come up with an effec- j tive gimmick to

Heading: Called 'Sensitive'
Content: by Beverly Anderson and Linda Gagliardi Bucknell University was host to the
    Festival Quartet on Tues, evening at the Davis Gym Annex. This outstanding
    group is com prised of Victor Babin, piano; Szyman Goldberg, violin; William
    Primrose, viola, and Nikolai Graudan, cello. The program opened with
    Dvorak's Quartet in E flat Major, Opus 87, .which was followed by the
    Quartet in G Minor by Mo zart. Because of faulty acoustics, the sounds did
    not seem to pro ject in a unified manner. In spite of this, the overall
    blend was fairly homogenous, although the piano overpowered the strings in
    some portions. In the Lento movement of the Dvorak Quartet, Mr. Graudan
    executed a most ef fective cello solo. Varieties of dynamic range were
    sensitively performed. The ensemble sound was excel lent in Schumann's
    Quartet in E flat Major, Opus 47. The piano seemed more in rapport with the
    total sound. Melodious cello and viola solos wove around the violin I and
    piano in the Scherzo move ment. The encore, a Minuet from the Weber Quartet,
    also featured Mr. Graudan in a delightful cello solo with discreet pizzicato
    accompani ment on the viola and violin. The program was a full one which
    seemed to favor the piano and violon. It is unfortunate j that Mr. Primrose
    and Mr. Grau dan did not have more solos, be cause these instruments are
    rare ly played so sensitively. The tone of the strings was excellent, and
    the program was performed with taste.

Content: (Continued from Page 3) tion at that university The crushing of lighted
    cigarette butts in the hair of the Negro girls tak ing part in the Sit-Ins
    in Nash ville didn't provoke them to anger nor scare them from seeking the
    goal they finally achieved. Yes, a Bucknellian did insult and attack a Negro
    athlete from another school, but this fellow also insulted and embarrassed
    two Bucknell girls previously that day. For his actions at the game and all
    that went before, he was dismissed from school. The same punishment should
    be administer ed to anyone who so discredits the name of Bucknell. In the
    realm of athletics, yes, the academic requirements at Bucknell are very
    stiff for many athletes. Even though a few of our athletes are on the Dean's
    List, many are in academic trouble and some are flunking out. I'm sure there
    are Negro athletes who can do at least that well at Bucknell. The Bucknell
    coaches are here j to produce good teams in their j respective sports. In
    order to do | this, they do try to get the best men they can to come to Buck
    nell. I very seriously doubt that, | if a coach wanted a particular I very
    good athlete who happened j to be a Negro to play on his team, would refuse
    to bring him here, I just because of the social difficul ties he might face.
    I have been on the swimming team for four years now. Granted, I am tired
    arid worn out when I leave prac tice. But I am not more tired! than my
    teammates, solely be- j cause I have to bear some addi-1 tional pressure
    imposed upon me j because of my race as stated by Mr. Zeller. The social
    situation has always j and will always be a touchy sub - 1 ject in most
    interracial relations. I No matter where one looks, on campus or off, people
    will be found to fit into three classes in j their relation with minority j
    groups. There are those who truly | accept all people as equals; those j who
    go to extremes to demon- j strate their liberalism; and also j those who
    won't even speak. I Bucknell isn't unique in having j these types of people,
    and most Negroes will not be suprised to ! find them here. Many Bucknellians
    might ask why would Negroes want to come j to a school like Bucknell with
    all its limitation's. Well I've been closely associated with many dif- j
    ferent colleges. I spent a semes- ter At Howard University in j Washington,
    D. C. and I've known j students at Syracuse U. for four | years. My sister
    has attended j Fisk University in Nashville, j Tenn., Oberlin College as an
    ex- j change student and now Univer sity of Michigan. At each one of these
    schools students have com plaints about the social life. The grass is not
    always greener. Here at Bucknell I know stu- 1 dents who have left, because
    the social life has not been to their liking. And just think, Bucknell is
    supposed to be one of the best schools for "catching a mate" . , Even with
    this ideal mating situ- 1 ation many Bucknellians do not take advantage of
    it and go through four years pinned off campus. So it would be foolish for
    any mature person to base his selection of a college solely on its social
    acceptability. Furthermore nearly every Negro student ex pects that in an
    interracial society there will be inconsistencies. It's what you make out of
    what you have where you have it that counts. Those who can overlook
    prejudice and ignorance can see a pleasant life. Yes. I do agree with
    calling for a favorable social climate in which the new African s.tudent ,
    may live next year. It must be remembered that Africans are proud of their
    color, their race, their nationality and have never felt that blackness
    deserved seecnd-rate treatment. Whereas most American Negroes are cal loused
    to the inconsistencies in our society, Africans are not. This African fellow
    will be soon living in a new society and asking many questions about the
    society. He will recall in his mind that in the society outside this campus
    -the Negro population is 10%. In cur society on cam pus it is presently
    0.1%. Will he :eel the effects of a difference o f : so much for so long?
    Can the j Bucknell society, so long compos- j ed of one socio-economic group
    nake a favorable social climate i for him? I hope so. If it can, then it is
    absolutely foolish for people to think that past incidents ! on Bucknell's
    campus will scare away American Negroes seeking an education. If it can't,
    then it is dangerous for this school and for this country to think that stu
    dents educated in this type of tight socio-economic society can be
    successful in a world where two-thirds of the people have dark skin. Until
    the attitude is dismissed that Bucknell is an undesirable place to have a
    number of Negro students, there will never be more than a few. Granted there
    is not "a very large number of Negroes who can financially af ford Bucknell
    and can academic ally qualify, but I know there are many more than two.

Content: Feb. 12, 1961 Dear Editor, Let me congratulate Mr. Zeller for his "economic and
    social" rea sons explaining the fact that there are " less negro students at
    Buck nell this year than at some times in the past." I would agree that we
    should impfove our "social climate" for coming years. However, Mr. Zeller
    also raised some interesting questions, which, I noticed, he very
    conveniently evaded answering. I quote, "Did you inquire how many negroes
    applied for admission in the class of 1964? How many were offer ed admission
    but elected not to come to Bucknell?" Quite frankly I have never walked into
    the Admissions Office and asked these questions. Why? If Mr. Zeller could
    not get an answer (at least one that was printable), I doubt that I, or any
    other Bucknell student, could either! But perhaps I have been too harsh on
    Mr. Zeller. Perhaps he, or SOMEONE, namely the Admissions Office, does know
    the answers--and will be kind enough to inform the Bucknell campus as to
    what they are! Curiously, Donna Snellbaker '61 (Continued from page 1) a

Heading: For Constitution
Content: Student Faculty Congress has | recently revised its constitution. The new
    constitution is to be voted upon by the student body I on Tues., Feb. 28, in
    the campus- wide SFC ' election. This revised ! constitution has been
    discussed and passed already in a joint meeting of the present SFC (Zoun-1
    cil and Cabinet. The major change in the con-1 stitution is that the SFC
    will be one body consisting of 21 mem bers. It is felt that in a smaller,
    more compact body, the Student Faculty Congress can work more efficiently
    and serve the entire body to a better advantage. Another change is that the
    vice president will now assume the duties of chairman of the Elec tions
    Committee and will run the affairs of the freshman class until its officers
    are elected. In these capacities the vice president will be taking over the
    responsibili ties now held by faculty mem bers. Under the revised
    constitution the vice president can be either a junior or a senior. It is
    felt that this will offer more of an oppor tunity for persons to work up in
    the organization. Another important item in the revised constitution is the
    addi tion of the Academic Advisory Committee "to consider the aca demic
    standards and program of Bucknell and ways in which they may be improved,
    and, if pos sible, specific steps to be taken." It was strongly felt that
    this is an area in which SFC should be concerned. Vice President Nominated
    for the office of vice president are William Dorr, Wil liam Fletemeyer, and
    Wayne Grove. Bill Dorr, a junior from Delmar, N. Y., has served on the SFC
    this year as athletic repre sentative. Co-captain of the swimming team, Dorr
    is a Fire side leader, and a men's counselor, a member of Omicron Delta Kap
    pa and public relations chairman for Phi Gamma Delta. A junior from Kennet
    Square, Bill Fletemeyer is program direc tor for WVBU, a member of IFC, has
    been on MSG, and is a mem ber of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Wayne "Duffy" Grove, a
    junior from York, is in the Economics Club, on WVBU, advertising man ager
    for the Bucknellian, Fresh man Fireside leader, and secre tary of Kappa
    Sigma. Recorder Diane Strang, who is SFC re corder this year, will, as has
    been done in past years, move up to run alone for the position of sec
    retary. Nominated for the office of re corder are Beverly Behrens, Char
    lotte Edwards, and Diann Patter son. If the revised constitution is passed,
    the new recorder will assume the duties of publicity chairman. Running for
    the office of treas urer are Margaret Hill, Allen Macomber, and Ann Scott.

Heading: Facts and Questions
Content: It is not often that the Bucknellian answers a readers' letter through an
    editorial. However we feel that Mr. Zeller's letter of February 6 is a
    special case. We are sincerely sorry that our editorial angered Mr. Zeller
    to the point that he felt strong language might help an otherwise weak case.
    The Bucknellian did send a re porter to the admissions office last year, he
    was refused the pertinent information on the basis that it was confi
    dential. Mr. Zeller made the point in his letter that there is no University
    policy toward Negroes concerning admissions. We sincerely hope that this
    statement doesn't imply that there are policies toward other racial or
    religious groups. The letter argued that there simply aren't enough "fiinan-
    cially able Negroes to go around." However, investiga tion shows that the
    Betty Ann Quinn Scholarship, which contrary to Mr. Zeller's letter is
    specifically for Negroes, is not being used at this time. The letter made a
    valid point in its statement as to why there are so few, indeed no, Negro
    athletes at Bucknell However a boy by the name of Irwin Roberson who won a
    silver medal for the United States in the recent Olym pics, applied for
    admission to Bucknell four years ago; he was in the top quarter of his
    class, and a star football player and trackman. He is a Negro; he wanted to
    come to Bucknell; he was denied admission. This fact has been supplied by a
    present Bucknell student who is a friend of Roberson's. It is entirely
    possible that there was some perfectly valid reason for rejecting this boy.
    Unfortu nately it is not apparent. We must accept Mr. Zeller's statement
    that the social climate at Bucknell is not as sympathetic to Negro stu dents
    as it might be. We wonder whether a continued lack of Negro students will do
    anything to change this sit uation. Also, the soeiaL opportunities for Jews,
    Catholics, Koreans, Burmese and other non-Anglo-Saxon Protestants are really
    not much better. Yet each of these groups is represented on the Bucknell
    campus. Now it seems, to us, unfair to subject these groups to a narrow
    social life,, while saving the Negro student from it. There appears to be
    something wrong with Mr. Zeller's reasoning on this point. We do agree with
    Mr. Zeller that the absence of a pho tograph from the application will not
    take prejudice out of people's hearts, but it certainly would be a step
    toward attracting more Negro applicants, which Mr. Zeller agrees would be a
    more desirable goal than having them scared away by the picture
    requirentent. According to Mr. Zeller's letter we have been "beating the
    director of admissions." We are extremely sorry if we gave this impression.
    The Bucknellian is quite aware that Mr. Walling and his staff are not in the
    position of being directly responsible for admissions policies. How ever,
    somewhere at some time, there must take place a discussion as to how the
    incoming freshman class will be "distributed". We must apologize to Mr.
    Walling; we centered on the Admissions Office only because it is the place
    where, if a policy of discrimination were existent, it would be most
    blatantly manifest. The Bucknellian is grateful for the response of its read
    ers in last week's paper, and we hope that this important question will not
    be allowed to escape us again.

    any society, in order to de velop the individual's intellect and
    understanding of his fellow man, there must be a variety of people; not only
    in character make-up, but in the variety of races, religions, and creeds.
    For this reason, the society of the United States as a whole has al ways
    been a rich and satisfying country to live in. In order to | enrich college
    life for students at Bucknell, there inust be a more heterogeneous student
    body. But I a heterogeneous student body can only come about by the removal
    of certain barriers that prevent individual minority groups from coming to
    Bucknell. Before citing these barriers, we | would like to state our
    ultimate j goal in writing this letter. It is our belief that any university
    can ! improve, enlarge the nature of its education. This is not a personal I
    attack against the administration nor any person in it, but we are I
    attempting to express our desire j for some changes which we feel j would be
    beneficial to the stu dents and the university. We j realize that in order
    to accom- j plish anything in this world it I must be done in a calm and ma
    ture manner. Our goal is the | creation of a better Bucknell. Our student
    body should be a i natural accumulation of all types of human beings. This
    can only I come about when certain ob- I stacles are removed. We cannot j
    expect individuals from minority i groups to apply to an institution 1 |
    such as Bucknell when they are made to feel unwanted. The presence on this
    campus of fra- j j ternities and sororities that dis criminate is an
    impediment to the ; natural accumulation of a diver-1 sifted student body.

Heading: Think: Then Vote
Content: In the political structure of a university, students have no power. They have
    influence over only those areas granted them by the trustees or
    administration. In Buck- nell's case, they have been granted the privilege
    of limit ed self-government. This means that they can elect of ficers who
    meet as an official body, regulate drives for funds, conduct such programs
    as Spring Festival and freshman hazing, and sponsor the Artist Series. All
    these things are presently done by the SFC, but these are relatively minor
    administrative functions. The most important thing an official
    representative body of the students should do is to mold opinion, to
    deliberate and evaluate. The rightful subject matter for such de liberation
    is in this case the academic and social welfare of Bucknell as an
    institution of higher learning. This im plies concerns within and among the
    students about not only learning itself, but also their roles as citizens.
    For this reason, concerned students should have a struc tural means of
    meeting together and considering issues that are important to the learning
    experience and to pub lic citizenship. It is their position as an official
    body to deliberate on issues that are important to the quality of the
    university and to the public welfare. It is fitting for them to consider
    issues carefully and, arriving at respon sible opinions, to publicize these
    opinions in an attempt to move public sentiment behind them and ultimately
    bring the measures into effect. It is .to the credit of the present SFC that
    it has established a committee on na tional and international issues. We
    hope that it will pur sue this end and broaden its role in the formation of
    cam pus opinion and in the fostering of responsible discussion and opinion
    forming in all situations. Who should be the leaders of such an
    organization? They should first of all be responsible people who will carry
    out their administrative duties effectively and will not overstep their
    bounds in deliberation and declaration. They should understand the meaning
    of the learning ex perience and be eager to support those measures which
    improve it. They should understand the aims, and needs of the students they
    represent. They should be aware of social issues beyond the campus. In
    short, they should be competent and responsible, moral and intellectual lead
    ers. Is this the type of person we have elected in the past? Is it the type
    we are about to choose in the coming elections? is the obligation of this
    univer- I sity to offer these minority groups j a chance to develop. And
    since we believe that Jhis j is the democratic way of life, we j ask the
    student body, the faculty and the administration for their | support for the
    following pro- J posai: 1. In order to live "democracy" | and not just talk
    democracy, we I ask for the establishment of the I policy which would
    prohibit the | existence of those organizations ; which exclude persons
    because of racial or religious reasons, ' through clauses or by means of in
    which a person has not been pledged because of his religion or race. My main
    point is this--even with the elimination of actual, specific discriminatory
    clauses, there will still be discrimination. The selection is necessary for
    the continuance of the fraternity; dis crimination, an outgrowth of se
    lection, is a defense mechanism in which subjective evaluations are
    substituted for objective ones, emotion overrides reason, and cultural
    biases suppress ideals. Regrettably, there is often at anyone into their

    But this is NOT to say that there will no longer be any dis- i should
    actively urge the initia- i lion of this proposal. With the removal of the
    prac tice of discrimination by fraterni ties and sororities, the social at-

    to individuals from minor ity groups to apply for admission. But this is not
    the only barrier I that must be overcome. At the present, there is a bill

    The advanced ROTC program, which leads to a commission in the Regular Army

    selective basis. The present freshman class (1964), which entered under the
    regulations now in force, will be the last class to complete the two- year
    basic training as a require ment of the sophomore year. In 1950, at the time
    of the Korean crisis, the Trustees of the University, faced with an immi
    nent drop in the enrollment of men students, and aware of the probable need
    for the training of Reserve Officers for the Armed Services, entered into a
    contract, at the invitation of the Army, un der which an ROTC program was

    need of Reserve | Officers at about the present an nual level o f' 14.000,
    with college enrollments in basic ROTC ex pected to double in the next
    decade, the national requirements for compulsory ROTC have di minished.
    Under these circumstances, the University Board of Trustees de cided last
    June that for men stu dents, beginning with the Class of 1965, enrollment in
    Bucknell should no longer carry with it a requirement of enrollment in the
    basic ROTC program. It should be pointed out, however, that a number of
    considerations point to a voluntary program rather than to no program at
    all. As long as America lives in the present world of tension, a strong
    defense is vital for our national security and that of our friends around
    the world. Some of the universities of the country must continue, in the
    national interest, to provide opportunity for the training of future leaders
    of the Armed Services, whose motivation in the direction of a Service career
    is strong. The Service Academies do not, and could not without drastic
    expansion, meet the present need for officers. Bucknell's unit is one of the
    bet ter ones, and there is no good reason for dropping it. By adopt ing a
    voluntary program at both levels, Bucknell places itself, as far as ROTC
    programs are con cerned, on a basis of equality in recruiting men students,
    with all educational institutions, whether they have compulsory or volun

    Signa Phi Nothing, let me give you several warnings. First off, it is the
    only fraternity that admits girls. Second, there is no pledge period; each
    new member im mediately goes active. Perhaps " inactive" is a more accurate
    term; there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns, no sports, no games,
    no dues, no grip, and no house. The only thing Signa Phi Nothing has that
    other fraternities have is a fraternity hymn. In fact, two hymns were
    submitted to a recent meeting of the national board of directors (none of
    whpm attended). The first hymn goes: Hotcha, boop-boop-ardoop, Mother's
    making blubber soup. The second hymn is considerably longer: A Guernsey's a
    caw, A road is a lane, When you're eating chow, Remember the mein! Pending
    the next meeting of the national board of directors, which will never be
    held, members are authorized to sing either hymn. Or, for that matter,
    Stardust. Perhaps you are asking why there should be such a fraternity as
    Signa Phi Nothing. I will give you an answer--an answer with'which you
    cannot-possibly disagree: Signa Phi Notking fills a welLneeded gap. Are you
    suffering from mental health? Is logic distorting your thinking? Is ambition
    encroaching on your native sloth? Are your long-cherished misapprehensions
    retreating before a sea of facts? In short, has education caught up with
    you? If so, congratulations. But tell the truth--wouldn't you like to make
    an occasional visit back to the good old days when you were not so wise and
    composed and industrious--when you were, in fact, nuttier than a fruitcake?
    If you pine for those old familiar miasms, those dear, dead vapors, join
    Signa Phi Nothing and renew, for a fleeting moment, your acquaintance with
    futility. We promise nothing, and, by George, we deliver it! (c) 1961 M,,
    stm We, the makers of Marlboro, promise smoking pleasure and we think you'll
    think we deliver it--both from Marlboro and from our new unfiltered king-
    size Philip Morris Commander. Welcome aboard! "

Heading: In Last Ten Seconds
Content: The Bison basketball team vio lated a cardinal rule of offense last Saturday
    night twice in the last minute and received their ninth loss of the season
    74-73 at the hands of the University of Buffalo. Two times within 30
    seconds, when they already had the ball game won 73-72, the BU Bisons took
    shots instead of hold ing onto and freezing, the ball. Twice Buffalo was
    able to take desperation shots. The second time an off-balance jump shot
    swished through the hoop with less than 10 seconds to go. Buck- nell didn't
    have enough time for even one desperation toss. The Bisons got off to a hot
    start, scoring 22 points in the, first nine minutes of play to Buffalo's 8.
    A series of wild shots disrupt ed the home team's offense and the visitors
    went on to outscore Bucknell 31-16 in the remaining time of the half. In the
    second stanza the Bisons trailed by as much as seven points before a
    determined drive overtook the Bulls from upstate New York. Joe Steiner and
    Hal Smoker both got into foul trouble with about 10 minutes remaining.
    Steiner, who finished the night with 19 points, retired to the bench.
    Fortunately the move did not halt the Bucknell rally, but the two shots
    taken in the closing seconds negated Joe's clutch bas kets near the end of
    the contest. Bruce Babich was high man for the Bucknell team with 20 points.

Content: Tomorrow afternoon and night offers a full sports menu for the Bison rooters.
    Lehigh University is here at Davis Gym for four events while the University
    of Pennsylvania completes the sports | spectacular. The Lehigh Engi neer's
    swimming and basketball teams, neither sporting a winning record, will be on
    hand while Penn takes on Bucknell's wrest ling squad. The Lehigh basketball
    team, j having beaten only Delaware, | Muhlenberg, and Lafayette is a | weak
    3-15, should be fair game ; for Coach Ben Kribb's charges, ! while a 3-5
    swimming team ! should not give Bob Latour's j swimmers much competition. On
    I the hardwood Lehigh's only claim | to fame is a 6-1 forward who fin- |
    ished tenth in the nation last year | in scoring with a 24.8 average. Norm
    "Brand X " Brandi is a junior this year and has slipped i to about 19 points
    a game, but is j still a dangerous shooter. Eleven Losses in a Row Fcfr the
    second year in succes- ! sion, Coach Tony Packer expect- ; ed the Lehigh
    University basket- i ball squad to be improved in i speed, shooting, and
    team bal- j ance. Unfortunately the Engi neers had lost 15 games, including
    111 in a row. The team lacks j height, and has faced the pros- i pect of
    having to outhustle and outscore the same top eastern op- | position which
    held the Engineers | to a 6-16 record last year. The return of all of last
    year's starters gave Packer a firm foun dation on which to build for 1960-
    61. Leading the returnees is junior guard Norm Brandi (6-1), who broke the
    Lehigh season rec ords for field goals, free throws and total points as he
    averaged 24.8 points per game. The others are junior guard Bob Happ (5-11),
    and three seniors: center Ken Weaver (6-4), forward Ross Cul- ligan (6-2),
    and forward Jack Palfi (6-3). Happ is Brandi's Only Aid Happ, with a 10.3
    average, was the only player besides Brandi to score in double figures, and
    Pack er will be trying to get more scor ing punch into the lineup. Senior
    Jay Anglada (6-4), senior Dave Benedict (6-4), and sophomore Bill Dosedlo
    (6-3) may help to provide it. Packer expects soph omore guard Dave Usilton
    (6-1) to become the team's playmakerand floor leader. Four other players add
    depth to the squad. Junior John Jacob sen (6-4), and sophmores Tom
    Millhollan (6-0), Gary Stolberg (6-0), and John Thomas (6-2) have shown
    promise. Swimming Team Lacks Depth The swimming team, runnerup to Bucknell
    in the MAC competi tion last season, does not look as strong as last year's
    group. Coach Bill Christian feels that the team, although not blessed with
    depth, is balanced overall and will be i particularly strong in certain
    events. Co-captain Dave Thorne and Jack Farrell form a strong backstroke
    duo, and co-captain LeRoy Keiser and Paul Abram son are a formidable pair in
    the j orthodox breaststroke. Christian's freestylers include Jeff Scholz,
    George Kelly, Dick j Cawthorne and John Folwdll, while Keiser, Thorne and
    Abram son will handle the individual j medley. Bob Slater and John I Gendell
    are the Lehigh divers. Scholz and butterfly specialist j | John
    DeBarbadillo, both sopho- mores, will be the two strongest additions to the
    team which fin- j ished second in last year's Middle ! Atlantic Conference
    meet. Both j boys are versatile swimmers with I | great potential, and
    Christian will I ! probably use both in the relay I events as well as in
    their special- j ties. He indicated that their pres,- ence will make the
    team stronger I i in the relays, and a solid contend-1 ! er in the Middle
    Atlantic Confer- i ence meet, to be held March 3 I and 4 at West Chester

Heading: ...AND HE'LL BREAK HIS NECK TO DO IT"
Content: In 1958 when Bill Ebben was only a few months away from his engineering degree
    at the University of Detroit, he was in touch with 15 prospective employers.
    He chose the Michigan Bell Telephone Com pany because: " This company
    offered the kind of engineering management opportunity I wanted -- and they
    weren't kidding." One of Bill's first assignments was a survey of M ichigan
    Bell's big Central District to find out how long available building space
    could accom modate the switching equipment required by rapid telephone
    growth. " I wasn't given any instruc tion," Bill says, " I was just told to
    do the job." So Bill did it. His report became the guide for planning and
    budgeting future construction. On his next m ove, Bill proved he could
    handle supervisory responsibility. He was sent to head up a group of seven
    engineers to design a new long distance switching center for Saginaw,
    Michigan --a $4,000,000 engineering project. Today, Bill is on the staff of
    Michigan Bell's Program Engineer. He's working on a system for mechanized
    control of telephone construction costs. How does Bill feel about his job? "
    Give a man a tough job and a chance to go somewhere--and he'll break his
    neck to do it. Of course, I don't think I'm going to be running the business
    next year--but I'm getting every opportunity to hit the top. You don't worry
    about opportunity here--you worry about whether you're as big as the job."
    If you're a man like BiU Ebben, a man who can size up a job, figure out what
    needs to be done, and then do it--then you should get in touch with one of
    the Bell Companies. Visit your Placement Office for literature and
    additional information. 11Our number one aim is to have in all management
    jobs the most vital, intelli gent, positive and imaginative men we can
    possibly find." F rederick R. K appel , President American Telephone &

Content: When Pal Joey, the Broadway and Hollywood production by Rodgers and Hart, was
    first pre sented in 1940, half of the audi ence applauded wildly and the
    other half sat in stony silence. Rodgers and Hart had done the impossible:
    they had created a leading man who was a heel, a : cad, and a louse, but
    still they had endowed him with an appeal that made men sympathize with him
    and women wish that he would try to seduce them. University Players, under
    the direction of Michael Gavin, will present Pal Joey on March 17, 18, 23,
    and 24 in the University Theatre. Jeff Gaynor, as Joey, sings, dances, and
    woos his way from a little night club in the wall to his own, Chez Joey.
    Along his pathway he meets Linda Garrett as the "bewitched, bothered, and
    bewildered" Vera, who is out for all she can get and gets it. And in a
    nightclub he finds Linda, played by Susan Aymar, who "Could Write a Book" if
    asked, and Gladys, a "Red Hot Mamma," played by Judith Levy, who has plenty
    of "Zip" . Tickets will be available at the Bookstore and the Pitch Pipee be

    printed page and in heated and some not-so-heated discussions., In view of
    the recent ex- ' change of letters-to-the editor, the

Heading: Bucknellian
Content: wishes to clarify its stand on discrimination. We originally raised the issue in
    order to obtain some concrete proof for the charge that the admissions staff
    discriminates in their selection of students. We are happy to recognize, as
    a result of figures released last week, that this charge is completely
    unfounded. Moreover, a check of scholarship records shows that the Betty Ann
    Quinn scholarship mentioned in last week's editorial has been awarded to a
    Negro student every se mester for the past five years. At present, it is not
    being used because its recipient withdrew at the end of the first semester.
    In addition, a check of applications shows that Irwin Roberson, the star
    athlete described in last week's edi torial, did not apply to Bucknell. It
    is thought that he was interested in this school and may have been ap
    proached by the athletic department, but no facts are available to

    fraternal organization reserve the right to choose members on the basis of
    personal qualities, and that each chapter, in turn, is free to extend
    membership accord ingly. But why, you ask, should we bother to diversify the
    student population? There is an answer to this question: it is unrealistic
    and provincial for a university to exist as an island in the midst of the
    racial problems confronting . the rest of the United States. To discourage
    contact with other races and nationalities is to shelter today's student and

Content: 

Heading: by Richard Goldman
Content: Recently the administration of this university under took a program designed to
    raise the academic standards of Bucknell. The quality of both courses and
    professors has improved considerably. I think most students will acknowledge
    the successful efforts by the administration to make Bucknell wprthy of
    calling itself an "institution of higher learning." I feel, however, that
    the administra-

Heading: I
Content: tion has overlooked one very important fact. Incoming freshmen are not aware of
    this academic re form program; and, under the present system, the only way
    they can find out is to go through the rigors of their j first stemester.
    Unfortunately, some freshmen experience more difficulty than others because
    they sigh up fpr the wrong courses, plan an unbalanced schedule, or take too
    many courses in one semester that involve extensive read- ! ing or writing.
    Actually, the difficulty these people experience is unnec essary. The
    situation can be remedied if the administra tion, along with its other
    reforms, will provide counseling for freshmen before they sign up for
    courses and before they arrive on campus in September. Right now the only-
    "counselor" available to a high school senior, who has ! been accepted by
    Bucknell, is the catalogue. An incom-

Heading: I
Content: ing freshman must select his first semester courses, mak- 1 ing his decisions
    solely on what he learns from the cata logue. . For instance, History 99 and
    100: "The evolution of Western Civilization from its beginning to the
    present time, with emphasis on problems and values." This is j what it says
    in' the catalogue; sounds pretty innocuous, j doesn't it? There is nothing
    to keep a freshman from taking courses like History 99, Religion 100, Math.
    201, a third year language, and English 101 all in the first se mester.
    Counseling is definitely needed, as evidenced by the fact that too many
    freshmen took a first semester as heavy j as the one just outlined, too
    heavy to handle efficiently, j and they are now in serious academic
    difficulty. Some were forced to do only half a job on one or two subjects .
    * j in hopes that the extra time could be used to pull up two

Heading: I
Content: other subjects. Too many freshmen have a "2.000" as their goal rather than
    striving for a higher average. This is a poor situation to be forced into
    and a poor attitude to take toward learning. The administration should
    require incoming freshmen to come up to Bucknell before the end of July to
    go over their first semester schedule with their counselor. The counselor
    should make changes to make sure that the new student takes the best courses
    and spreads them out so he has the time to get the most from his courses. I
    realize that in some cases a freshman will find it impossible to arrange a
    trip to Bucknell for this purpose, but institu tions such as Penn State are
    able to operate a counseling system similar to this one, and I see no reason
    why Buck nell should be behind in this area. My suggestions will not help
    the people who are too lazy to keep up their marks; but if a counseling
    service is established more hard-working, and deserving students will be
    left at Bucknell to benefit from the newly improv ed academic standards. I
    the actions pf a few. We took | the stand that this was not typical i of the
    feelings of the majority >>of I the students;. One possibility we
    investigated j was the sponsoring of a capable i Negro student who lacked
    finan- j cial backing to come to Bucknell. I We discussed tthis with the
    admin- I istration and also sent two people l to a meeting of the National
    Asso- j ciation of Student Government, i who was dealing with similar j
    problems at the time. After much I investigation, it was found that we !
    would be unable to sponsor a j Negro student. However, the time was not
    wasted because we did manage to present the ideas and feelings of the
    Bucknell students. Another more recent problem that came up dealt with
    student concern with the calendaring of social events during the month of
    March. The vice president of the SFC met with the Dean of Student Affairs to
    consider the problem. As -a result', a compromise was reached. We have also
    revised the freshman hazing rules to make them more realistic and ap- j
    plicable. We have revised our own constitution to make it more I practical
    and workable. Since we feel that there is a ' growing in- | terest in
    current affairs among Bucknell students, we are form- ; ing a committee to

Heading: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Content: Dear Editor, , With concern over the recent editorial approach to the first se
    mester operation of women's co operative self-government, Senate would like
    to present some com ments on the questions which you raised. As a
    representative body, we Ijave felt the need to be aware throughout the past
    semester of the problems which are in estab lishing a new mechanism of self-
    government. However, we have come to be lieve, in the past months,, that
    women are beginning to under stand their new government as a practical
    system affording them the opportunity to make their liv ing situation one of
    individual freedom within the boundaries of standard regulations based upon
    cooperation with and concern for others. The role of residence councils, a
    completely new con cept on this campus, is gradually becoming clearer both
    to the women students and to the coun cils themselves, who have, when ever
    necessary used the open communication with the Judicial Board and found it
    helpful. As was explained to the women students in the fall, the Commit tee
    for the Revision of the Con stitution has served to bring to Senate, to
    House, and to all the women students through Senate's widely distributed
    biweekly min utes comprehensive discussion of all the comments and
    suggestions for possible changes made on the ballots by which the women
    adopted our new government last spring. These discussions are the basis from
    which proposed change will be incorporated in the Constitution presented to
    the women for ratification in the * spring. As this evaluation is a continu
    ous process both in Senate and in the minds of every woman stu dent, it is
    our hope that the women will continue to communi cate their ideas and
    suggestions to their representative bodies so that our work can most
    effective ly serve their interests. Thank you. Members of Senate of WSGA I
    feel that one may learn just as much from hearing discussions upon those
    subjects about which one learns in books. I felt that the CHALLENGE program
    pro vided such an opportunity to hear and learn from sources apart from
    books. I woud hope that in the near future we would have an other such
    program. One of the interesting features of this program which also added to
    the enjoyment and maintain the interest of the program was the fact that the
    speakers were dynamic in their presentations. There were few occasions on
    which it became difficult to hear what was being said by the speakers.
    Sincerely, Dick Fidler

    currently under discussion in the Congress is that of the reorganization of

    Federal Government with the] three branches under central con trol. A
    problem which will be | open for discussion for the first time at the next

    been spending I its time this year. This is not a complete list, but we
    think it will serve to give the Bucknell students some idea as to the func

Heading: Honesty Today
Content: Reprinted from-- Redbook Magazine Eight leading Americans spoke out today
    against widespread dis honesty and the growing accept ance of it in America
    life. In order to determine what can be done to retain traditional Standards
    of honesty, Redbook Magazine asked reporter William Peters to interview
    Margaret Mead, Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, Fairfax Cone, Phyllis McGinley, Senator
    Margaret Chase Smith, Judge Learned Hand, Agnes E. Meyer and Edward R.
    Murrow. Most of those interviewed felt there was more personal dis honesty
    and more tolerance of it than in previous generations. Ad vertising
    executive, Fairfax Cone and Anthropologist Margaret Mead expressed opinions
    that to day's personal dishonesty was as sociated with Prohibition. Mrs. |
    Agnes Meyer and Senator Mar- j garet Chase Smith related- it to World War II
    Feel Cheated The idea that some people tend to cheat when they feel cheated
    I was expressed frequently. Those I interviewed said that while cheat- ing
    occurred against large imper sonal institutions such as govern - 1 men*,
    insurance companies, cor porations, schools, large depart-1 ment or chain
    stores, honesty be-1 tweefi individuals was as strong as ever. Almost
    everyone interviewed, the article reports, pointed to the; inequities in the
    income-tax law and several mentioned the Social Security regulations which
    pen alizes people for working after they are 65. Judge Learned Hand, alone,
    stressed an increase in certain kinds of morality pointing to im provements
    in execution laws, | political graft, voting frauds and | improved standards
    of judicial j conduct, although he felt that | "we seem also to have lost
    most | of our former sense of personal j responsibility." In discussing
    religion in con- j nection with morality, Dr. Rein- j hold Niebuhr asserted
    that "re-1 ligion is much more popular b u t, less meaningful in America to
    day." He felt there has been a j gradual loss of spirit in the re ligious
    community, stressing that the church had become more a social than a
    religious institution, in recent years. Security Need The preoccupation with
    security was a predominant factor in the comments of Edward R. Murrow who
    said that "when a desire for complete security becomes a ma jor goal, it is
    little more than a desire to return to the warmth and comfort of protected
    child hood." In summing up the solutions to the question of morality, there
    was a general agreement that dis cipline must be strengthened. Equal stress
    by many of those interviewed was on removing the inequities from necessary
    laws and rules such as unfair income- tax laws, inequitable earning re
    quirements under Social Security, confusion of purpose in business expense
    accounts, shadowy lines beween honest practices and con- flcts of interest,
    unjust grading of students on curves and on strictly objective tests that
    ignore indi vidual differences, draft regula tions that discriminate,
    unequal application of laws. Want Leadership "The American people have
    lacked leadership in all these areas," Mrs. Agnes Meyer said. "We need the
    new values and goals that can only be defined by strong, vigorous and
    intelligent national leadership. Instead of pursuing individual goals of
    wealth and security, we need have our horizons broadened until we can see
    the far greater im portance of freedom and coopera tion. Our public leaders
    must begin using all available scientific knowledge about the modem world
    and its problems to arrive at an understanding of our proper national goals
    and then they must begin to talk clearly and honestly to the American people
    about them."

    and find out how demo cratically and unbureaucratically we can bring it into
    being." "We need a, new principle of human beings and self determination,"
    pleaded Harrington. "We must establish a democratic society in which people
    determine their own destiny." Plea For Balance Taking the opposing side, Dr.
    Russell Kirk stated that it is simple to attack the established order, but
    more difficult to offer a sufficient remedy. In a delivery which seemed
    pallid beside the vitality of his opponet, Kirk sug gested that Harrington's
    form of government was based on a lib eral error of the nineteenth cen tury:
    that man is sufficient unto himself and that enlightened self- interest is
    enough. Today, we recognize this as a fallacy. In a controlled tone, Kirk
    asked for balance. "The state has neg lected its obligatipn to society,"
    admitted the conservative, "but should we go to the extent of making the
    state a kind of social life and death?" Viewing a socialist state as pa- j
    temalistic, one which will give a ll! things to all men, Kirk claimed | that
    it will "deprive man of his manhood" and will "keep people | as puppetal
    children." Kirk refused t.o consider the problem of poverty in America
    seriously. The "pockets of pov-' erty" now existing are "far dif ferent from
    the grave social ills in less affluent societies," he said., The problem of
    America is, in- , stead, one of prosperity. "Pover-1 ty, by the viewpoint of
    Christian- , ity, is a blessed state." Our prob- j lems are those of the
    spirit, of boredom; these cannot possiby be solved by the central state.
    Kirk named only two channels open to the welfare state: That described in
    Orwell's 1984 which is one of togetherness, in which everything belongs
    to.everyone else; or that of Huxley's Brave New World, in which the corrupt
    ing vice of power destroys the arts and individuality. New Institutions In a
    five-minute rebuttal, Har rington quoted statistics from the Bureau of Labor
    proving that 41 million are hungry. He next an swered Kirk's challenge about
    the channels open to the welfare state: although such a state has the
    potential of totalitarianism, there is an alternative. "We must determined
    how state functions can be taken up in a democratic, free, and human
    manner." Charging that Kirk had avoided the problem of "where do we go
    now?", Harrington suggested that we must create new institutions was by far
    the more forceful of the two debaters, his ideas were visionary and often
    abstract. Relying too frequently on statist ics and scholarly articles, Kirk
    failed to defend soundly the con servative position, which suffered from his
    lack of verbal vigor. On the other hand, Harrington's brand of socialism
    seemed usually appealing in its garb of dynamic speech. Ucbroh seemed to
    think that Bel- ;ium had the intention of return ing sot :d once more
    resuming command of the nation. As far as the UN is concerned, Mr. Debrah
    said that they were called in to protect the independ ent nation and if they

    Saturday, as a part of the. Challenge Program, Mr. E. M. De- | branf
    counsellor for the Embassy of Ghana, spoke in Spotts Audi torium on the
    African Dilemma. Mr. Debrah began by using Ghana as an illustration of the
    great transition made by a colony change in its society. Under co- j
    lonialism the tribal chief had been reduced to a stooge of the foreign
    powers. Now he is somewhat re stored and has become the spirit ual and moral
    power of the coun try. The greatest challenge of Ghana's independence was
    the change trom imposed government without local composition to the
    sovereign state. Following these political ac complishments, the nation
    faced economic development. Since state enterprise was necessary, socialism
    was the answer. Hydro electric, arms, and other pioneer industries are state
    owned. Ghana lacks capital investment and wel comes it from stable companies
    in any foreign nation. She only 11 asks that local people be employ- ! ed
    and that local raw products be # consumed. The co-operative system is
    Ghana's answer to the agricul tural problem. This partnership method
    provides capital and the needed farm machinery. Ghana's immediate economic !
    goal is the lessening of, depend- ! ence on her principle export, I cocoa,

    proceeded to' examine the Ghanian principles of foreign policy. Their policy

    as it comes along, rather than judging everything in terms of the cold war.

    Norman Thomas during the Chal lenge program Fri. morning. Ad dressing an
    audience which com pletely filled Vaughan Literature Auditorium, he argued
    emphatic ally and convincingly for univer sal, controlled disarmament down
    to the police leveL Thomas stated that the nature of modem weapons and the
    mass annihilation of human life and civilization which would result from
    their use make disarmament the only sane course to follow. At p*resent, he
    declared, there are "stockpiles containing the equiva lent of ten tons of
    TNT for each inhabitant of the world." Term ing the existing situation a
    "bal ance of terror," he described the ease with which this balance could be
    upset and predicted that if present conditions continue, such an upset is
    inevitable. Disarmament Not Enough Realistically, Thomas admitted that
    disarmament, even if success ful, would not guarantee world peace, and that
    other steps would be necessary. He stressed the need to strengthen the
    United Nations, which, in spite of its many imperfections, represents the
    only step yet made toward world cooperation. With respect to America's
    foreign policy, he appealed for disengagement, which he defined as an
    "orderly withdrawal from commitments involving the risk of war." Discussing
    necessary economic ! measures, Thomas deplored the j "war economy" of our
    present I "garrisoned state," in which al- I most half of the funds

    unmarred by a U2 inci- | dent, might produce a satisfactory , treaty, for
    Russia is more confi- I dent than America of winning the cold war without
    arms. In addi tion, however, he emphasized the fact that secret testing
    might be continued by Russia, and that in all probability no system of in
    spection adequate to detect such tests would be possible. Taking this fact
    into considera tion, he nevertheless declared that the risk of total
    annihilation im- j plied by continued armament is infinitely greater than
    the risk of I increased Russian power which might result from a policy of
    dis armament. Americans have ceased to value universal ideals and are
    concerned only with na tional security, with the preserva tion of their own
    way of life. But it is unrealistic to refuse to face the fact that this way
    of life would be more irrevocably des troyed by mass annihilation than by
    any form of Russian domina tion.

Content: by Bruce Boats President Kennedy's statement that "Our greatest challenge is
    that world that lies beyond the cold war" provided the point of departure
    for comments and argu ments in Ihe Friday evening panel debate of the
    Challenge prograin. John Zeller was the moderator of the panel which
    consisted of so cialists .Michael Harrington and Norman Thomas; Russell
    Kirk, a noted conservative; and E. M. De brah, a Ghanese diplomat. Michael
    Harrington keynoted his conception of our future world by questioning
    whether human nature could be changed in order that man would be able to
    live in a peaceful, unaggressive society. He said that during the last war
    Americans were both friendly to ward strangers and patriotic to their
    country, but he wondered if people would get along with each I other so well
    in the hoped for fu-1 ture society, or if there would be a "patriotism of
    peace.-" The na tion will probably be unified, but, he asked, "Will freedom
    survive in such a _ world?" When questioned as to how the world beyond the
    welfare state would be arrived at, he said that a political realignment
    would first be necessary. A  mass movement would then be required to carry
    forward a democratic allocation of resources and a democratically controlled
    nationalization of in dustry. This last step would have' to be carried out
    very imagina tively in order to benefit the worker ag much as possible.
    Norman Thomas scoffed at the idea of discussing the world be yond the cold
    war since "We Grouped around John Zeller, vice-president of the university
    and moderator of the Friiday night panel on 'Our Greatest Challenge: Ihe
    World Beyond the Cold War,' are (1. to r.) Dr, Russell Kirk, Michael
    Harrington, E. M. Debrah, and Dr. Norman Thomas.

Heading: In Speech on India's Economy
Content: by Joel Sekeres Dr. Norman Thomas, a candi date for the Presidency of the United
    States six times on the Socialist Party ticket, held a news conference at'
    the S. A. M. Fra ternity House today. Paul Pear son introduced the
    distinguished gentleman to a receptive audience of 85 students and news
    reporters. The purpose of the conference was to allow members of the press
    and the student body to question Mr. Thomas on various news events of
    national and interna tional importance. Cuban Revolution Discussed Mr.
    Thomas maintained some very definite opinions concerning the Cuban
    revolution. He said that as a social revolution "it has brushed out some
    evil things, but also has denied many civil liber ties." He did not think
    that the revolution was inspired by Com munists, but agreed that Russian
    Communists are gaining power in Cuba due to the current "anti- Americanism"
    existing there to day. When asked to comment on this current anti-
    Americanism in Cuba, Mr. Thomas replied that previous support of Batista for
    economic purposes by American ^industrialists set in motion "a | chain of
    errors." "The revolution ! could have been avoided if we had stopped Batista
    ourselves, but been accused of exploiting cer tain Latin AmeVican countries,
    Mr. Thomas feels that the "worst exploitation of these countries is by their
    own people, not by the United States. High taxes are creating an almost
    impossible burden for the poor people of Latin America and land reforms are
    an immediate necessity. The prominent speaker praised the Kennedy
    administration which has embarked on a training pro gram for potential
    leaders of the Latin American countries; leaders who may once again uphold
    de mocracy. He emphasized a "posi tive approach" to the Latin American
    situation as the only procedure to stifle Russiart Com munist influence
    there. The speaker was asked to com ment on the U-2 spy incident and the
    subsequent loss of world pres tige by the United States. He thought that
    Eisenhower should not have taken full responsibility for the incident,
    because, accord ing to informed sources, Eisen hower had no knowledge of
    that particular flight. However, the Republican administration feared that
    the Democrats would accuse Eisenhower "of failing to know what was going on
    in his admin istration," and advised Eisen hower to take the blame.

    peoples, returned yesterday from a four-year scientific expedition to the
    headwaters of the Amazon River. Among the many interesting mementos of his
    journey is his own head, shrunk to the size of a kumquat. He refused to
    reveal how his head shrinking was accomplished. " That's for me to know and

Heading: EASTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY
Content: The annual meeting of the American Philological Institute, held last week at
    Eastern Reserve University, was enlivened by the reading of two divergent
    monographs concerning the origins of early Gothic " runes,"  as letters of
    primitive alphabets are called. Dr. Tristram Lathrop Spleen, famed far and
    wide as the dis coverer of the High German Consonant Shift, read a paper in
    which he traced the origins of the Old Wendish rune " pt" (pronounced
    "krahtz" ) to the middle Lettic rune "gr" (pro nounced " albert" ). On the
    other hand, Dr. Richard Cummer bund Twonkey, who, as the whole world knows,
    translated " The Pajama Game" into Middle High Bactrian, contended in his
    paper that the Old Wendish rune " pt" derives from the Low Erse rune "mf"
    (pronounced "gr" ). Well, sir the discussion grew so heated that Dr. Twonkey
    finally asked Dr. Spleen if he would like to step into the gym nasium and
    put on the gloves. Dr. Spleen accepted the chal lenge promptly, but the
    contest was never held because there were no gloves in the gymnasium that
    would fit Dr. Twonkey. (The reader is doubtless finding this hard to believe
    as Eastern Reserve University is celebrated the length and breadth of the
    land for the size of its glove collection. However, the reader is asked to
    remember that Dr. Twonkey has extraor dinarily small hands and arms. In
    fact, he spent the last War working in a small-arms plant, where he received
    two Navy " E" Awards and was widely hailed as a "manly little C h a p ." )

    forward Pete Pavia who averaged 17 points per game last season, center
    "Chip" Lundy with a 13-point average from last year, Morris "Red" Boyer, 6-3
    forward and most accurate shot on the team, and Bob Kauffman, 5-11 per game
    last season. Also counted on for consistent scoring power are guards Danny
    George, 5-10, Gene Denahan, 5-10, and Charlie Turk, 6-0. Slated for
    extensive action at forward is Gale Schwilk, 6-4. Junior Tom Burns and sopho
    mores Andy Cook, Don Ecken- felder, Joe Gillings and Mike Mc- Hale will help
    provide the reserve strength on the Leopards 13-man squad. Lafayette has one
    of the hottest shooting clubs in the country. They're sixth in the nation in
    field goal percentage as a team, while two of their starting five, "Red"
    Boyer and Chip Lundy, are second and ninth, respectively. Lundy, leads the
    Leopard with a 17 point average, but is ninth : in the nation in rebounding.

Content: More Tough-minded Leader* In Business Reprinted: * From the Reader's Digest A
    distinguished student oi American business explains why the "nice guy" type
    of management is no longer ade quate to meet today's chal lenges. Condensed
    from Personnel by Cameron Hawley Our American industrial sys tem is
    challenged today as it has never been challenged before. Not only do we face
    the economic competition of the Communists, but in an era of freer and freer
    world trade, we are even more seriously threatened by our own friends. I am
    not by nature a pessimist; but I cannot escape the conclusion that the
    typical Amer ican corporation is in no condi tion to stand up to this kind
    of competition. Let me explain why I feel this way. Fogbound one night at
    the airport in Amsterdam, I was chat ting with the president of an American
    company that makes a well-known product in the kitchenware field. He had
    just concluded, he told me, a manu facturing agreement with a Euro pean
    firm. As many other U. S. businessman is learning, he had discovered that
    the way to beat high costs at home is to transfer production to plants
    abroad. But the reason for the foreign advant age is not what he had
    anticipat ed. "Until I got on the inside," he said, "I thought they had us
    lick ed over here because of wage rates. I know differently now. For every
    penny they're saving in direct labor costs, they've got us whipped by three
    cents in gen- I eral overhead. Inside the plant, it's about a standoff--but
    when you get to the office, they make | us look like fools." His company and
    this European 1 firm are about the same size in terms of units of
    production. The i American company has about I 1200 hourly workers in its
    plant, the overseas factory 1300. But | in terms of salaried employes, it's
    j a different story--912 in America versus 221 in Europe. There's a clue to
    our basic disadvantage in foreign competition today. Here in the United
    States we have the most expensive industrial m an-, agement on earth. It
    starts right at the top. The j American firm mentioned has an j active
    chairman of the board, a president, five vice presidents, and I an executive
    staff of 42 people. The European firm is run by a I managing director and
    one key I assistant. The top-management | staff totals only nine. The con
    trast continues right down the line. "They could pay our wage | rates," the
    American president said, "and we still couldn't com pete--our overhead would
    lick us hands down." "If you know the answer, why don't you go home with a
    big ax} and chop yourelf down to size?" j I asked. His reply pretty well
    defined the problem: "How can I? Even if I were capable of running our
    company as a one- man show--which is virtually | what's happening over here
    --I'm ] not at all certain that I could get away with it as far as our
    organi- | zation is concerned. Our second- j 1 level executives haven't been
    trained to take over in the way | these European boys have." Fin ally,
    almost to himself, he added, "I wonder how we got so far off the beam?" One
    Explanation I have a theory that may be at I least partially applicable.
    This ! man, like so many other corpora- j lion heads today, is now in his!
    middle 50's. That means he spent I his formative years during the j
    Depression, as I did, when busi ness leaders were being violently attacked
    as enemies of society-- greedy, grasping, dictatorial, anti- j social. Not
    all these politically inspired charges were true by any means, but the
    rising young busi-1 nessman of that day saw enough truth in some of them to
    cause I him to decide that when he got to the top. he was going to be i
    different. Before long, we found j a word to characterize that differ ence:
    "enlightened." At first "enlightenment" meant only a heightened social con
    science. Fairly quickly, however, the definition was broadened to imply a
    businessman who was, in all particulars, the opposite of what the old-style
    businessman was charged with being. If the Old Man was distatorial and auto
    cratic, we enlightened business men would bring democracy into the world of
    business. We would end one-man rule. We would employ group thinking. Thus,
    the committee system of opera tion came into being--and the top executive
    became a sort of super committee chairman. Again, if the Old Man's weak ness
    was in handling people, that was where the new man would be strong. This
    resolution led to great expenditures of time and effort in labor relations,
    public relations, community relations. Keeping everyone happy and con tented
    became a prime goal of business management. Thus was formed the rounded
    image of the ideal corporate ex ecutive. -- quiet, even-tempered,
    democratic, one of the group, a man who led by soft persuasion, a
    compromiser, a coordinator, a man who never ruffled tempers or hurt people's
    feelings--in short, a man whom everyone liked. It is the image of the "nice
    guy" wp still worship in this era, when "getting along with people" is
    counted as the most important talent a man can possess. Managerial
    Revolution At the same time, another trend was under way--the "managerial
    revolution." As American indus try grew older and larger, the ownership of
    more and more companies passed from, individ uals or families to general pub
    lic. Instead of businesses being run by the men who owned'them, they were
    managed by men who were hired to perform that func tion. The rise of
    professional man agement has been vital to our tremendous economic growth,
    but it has its drawbacks. The pro fessional business manager has every
    inducement to join the "nice guy" cult. The trouble is that he has to be a
    nice guy to many different people, all of whom have their own special in
    terests. He must not only keep his co-workers happy--he must also keep
    earnings high, or the board of directors won't like him. He must keep the
    price of the stock going up to please the in vestors. He must placate the
    union to avoid strikes, carefully nourish useful 1 friendships in Washington
    and the state capital, exert his charm on dealers and distributors--there's
    really no end to it. Professional management tends to encourage bureaucratic
    corpu lence. Just as the doctor these days calls in a specialist at the
    blink of an eye, so does the pro fessional manager. The Old Man of mv vouth
    was a G. P.--a gen- leral practitioner. Unless it was something too serious,
    he did the job himself. Not today. Now you set up a clinic--economists, l
    market analysts, statisticians,! method experts, legal advisers, j I etc.
    Then you need more experts I is a personal thing, inevitahly focused in one
    man. I wish more of our corporation presidents real ized it, and were more
    willing to assume the responsibilities It en tails. But I wish even more

    process. So the for being afraid to stick out their j bureaucratic fat gets

Content: When Gene Segin got his B.S. in Business Ad ministration at the University of
    Illinois, he was in touch with 8 prospective employers. Gene joined Illinois
    Bell Telephone Company because: " The people I talked to here made it very
    clear that I would not be shuffled into some narrow specialized job. I
    thought this job offered the greatest opportunity for broad experience." On
    his first assignment Gene was sent to Spring- field where he conducted
    courses in human rela tions for management people. His next move was to a
    traffic operations job in Rock Island. On this assignment he was in charge
    of all personnel who are directly responsible for handling telephone calls
    in this heavily popu lated area. Here Gene earned a reputation for sound
    judgment and skill in working with people. He was promoted to Traffic
    Supervisor. Today, Gene's chief responsibilities are in man agement training
    and development, and company- union relations. The latter includes contract
    bar gaining and helping settle labor disputes. How does Gene feel about his
    job? " It's a real challenge. I'm in some of the most vital and in teresting
    work in the country." And about the future--"W ell there aren't,an y
    pushover jobs around here. It's tough. But if a man has what it takes, I
    don't think there's any end to the oppor tunity in this business." I f

    call ed up to ask mv opinion of a man I knew who was a possible can didate
    for the presidency of a fairly large firm. I said I rated him as a
    brilliantly able man, that I had no doubt whatsoever that he could run the
    company with great success--provided he was given a free hand, and pro vided
    also that the board would support a blunt, straightforward man who would
    drive ahead, let ting the chips fall where they might. "You mean," the
    recuriter said, "he's the kind of man who doesn't get along too well with
    people?" "He gets along fine with cap able people who'll take orders and get
    a job done," I replied. "To those who can't--or won't--# he's not a. lovable
    character." And the recruiter said, "I'm afraid that rules him out. A man of
    that kind just doesn't fit into this picture." Months went by. Then one day
    my telephone rang again. It was my recruiting friend. Did I re member the''
    man we had talked about last summer? Where could he get hold of him? Re had
    half a dozen openings now for top ex ecutives of exactly that type. The tide
    has turned. A new image is being cast. We're set ting up a new prototype for
    the ideal corporation executive, a new and all social systems, and will
    continue to be a truth as long as man remains a human being: the perpetual
    need for the invigorat ing and vital force of personal leadership.

Heading: Wake Up!
Content: We are gratified by tHe intelligent student response to the panel? discussion
    sponsored by Phi Lambda Theta last week- It is our belief that'free and open
    discussion is the most.expedient means to the firing and solution of ques
    tions and problems, We have shared in a discussion, which was more than a
    mass of sound and fury; now, it is time for action. We heartily commend the
    faculty for their stand on the discrimination issue. An extension of the
    charter of Bucknell University, the faculty has stated that religious
    beliefs, national, and racial origins should be looked on as irrelevant in
    the selection of students and faculty;,that it recommends that no
    application blank contain a request for a photograph or for the religious
    affiliation of the ap-. plicant; and that it approves the intent of the Fair
    Educa tional Practice bills now before the state legislature. , The faculty
    has shown its position; what of the stu dents? In the previously mentioned
    debate, it was right ly stated that the bulk of the responsibility for
    diversify ing the student body rests upon the students themselves. # Various
    means to this end are now wihin the realm of possibility. A study undertaken
    by a member of the English de partment has shown that more applicants hear
    about Bucknell from other students, than from any other source. What better
    means exists, of changing the "image" of Bucknell, than by our informing
    students of other racial and economic groups of the educational
    opportunities available here? As students, we can encourage the filing of
    applications for admissions by qualified students from our own high schools
    and communities. We can do more ourselves toward securing such applications,
    than can the Admissions Office. Secondly, we all realize that a major reason
    for the ab sence of qualified students from lower economic groups results
    from a lack of substantial scholarships. Why not accumulate funds for a
    scholarship fund to be awarded to a selected student from another racial
    and/or economic group? This fund would be maintained by student con
    tributions and administered by the university. Incident ally, a contribution
    to such a scholarship fund would make an excellent class gift! Discussion
    has resulted in the realization that all seg ments of the Bucknell community
    desire a more diversi fied student body. We have stated several means by
    which we, as students, may further the realization of this goal. Now, let us
    act!

Content: The Bucknellian is pleased to have received the letter from the Student-Faculty
    Congress executive committee printed in last week's issue. We had first
    hoped to receive such a letter after the appearance of an editorial in mid-
    December ending with the question, "SFC, what are you doing?" SFC's letter
    was well-expressed, tactful and in formative, if somewhat late. We feel,
    however, that some of the criticisms which mentioned in the letter bear
    defense. The letter stated that SFC eliminated the leadership conference as
    useless. We would like to point out that the 1959 leadership con ference had
    a great deal to do with two necessary moves: (1) the revision of the SFC
    recognition of student organiz ations, and (2) the elimination of the ill-
    functioning SFC social committee. Even without such problems, the leadership
    conference, under a capable executive committee could become a truly
    profitable meeting of Bucknell's student leaders, perhaps their only
    opportunity to meet as such and con sider the problems of student government
    and student life at Bucknell. SFC should be the one organization most
    concerned with a unified student approach to university problems. SFC's
    second defense, is that it did not fail to distribute faculty-evaluation
    forms, but decided to evaluate the forms themselves. We feel that the
    Faculty evaluation forms are a valuable means for a professor to gain knowl
    edge of student reaction to his teaching methods. Once such a system of
    evaluation has been established, a prompt application of it pear the end of
    each semester would be most beneficial for both students and faculty.
    Regardless of whether the decision to evaluate the forms was made after SFC
    failed to distribute them, we look forward to a timely distribution of the
    evaluation forms during the spring semester. SFC's third defense was of
    communication. The

Heading: The President of SFC Speaks
Content: by Bill Weydemeyer May I begin by first expressing my sincere gratitude to all
    of those who supported me in the recent election, and to congratulate the
    winners and losers alike for a well fought campaign. As the new president of
    Student-Faculty Congress, I feel it is imperative to acquaint the students
    of Bucknell with my aims during the coming year and with the role which the
    campus as a whole must j play to make our university a better institution. I
    fear that the majority of the campus is content to sit back and 1 look at
    Bucknell with an air of complacency and self-satisfaction. ! This laissez-
    faire attitude is one reason why other institutions of I higher learning
    have remained static, when in reality they should have been thriving,
    dynamic bodies. Thus my first aim will be to awaken the student body to
    their responsibilities as members of the I Bucknell society, and to make
    them keenly aware that as good an I institution as Bucknell is, it certainly
    is not beyond reproach or above I revision. Minority Groups My second aim
    will' be to further the advancement of the minor ity groups on campus. By
    this I do not simply mean only race or religious groups, but also the
    independent men and women, who most certainly1 represent aft important
    segment of our campus. My third aim will be to re-establish the Student-
    Faculty Con gress ts the supreme governing body of the University, and to
    elevate it from the subservient position to which I fear it has slipped, due
    to the overly-emphasized role which our "social institutions" have come to
    play. This will necessarily mean a concentration of power in the supreme
    governing body and a lessening of concentration in all of the other branches
    of student government. This is not to say that such groups as the IFC, MSG,
    or WSGA will become stagnant organizations devoid of power, but that their
    power will come from the SFC and will be curtailed by them if such occasions
    should arise. Lastly, but certainly not the least important of my aims, will
    be an emphasis on the main purpose of the University, the intellectual
    stimulation of its students. I would attempt to fulfill this aim through one
    or both of two methods. First, by programs conducive to the stimulation of
    intellectual curiosity and interest, and second a possible revision of our
    present curriculum and semester plans at Bucknell. This would entail a
    lessening of the work load on both students and teachers, and thus allow
    more time for cpncentrated study leading towards positive achievement.
    Student Contributions The part which the students can play in this overall
    picture is great. Since, essentially, you are the government, a basic stand
    on various issues should be taken. Make known your views. Be ex pressive
    rather than complacive. Be alive instead of dormant. And realize most of all
    that what you do not say will not be realized, but what you speak out about
    will be heard. A  dynamic student body, one which is sincerely interested in
    making Bucknell a better institu tion, and one which takes positive, strides
    towards the procurement of ideas, will bp the student body that will get
    results. I ask you to think carefully about what has been said, seek Im
    provement for what you consider lacking, and take an active part in your
    student government. The meetings of the SFC are open to you --take advantage
    of the opportunities which are most certainly yours and which will assuredly
    make Bucknell an improved institution.

Heading: THE EDITOR
Content: Dear Editor: The question of student interest in the problems facing the present
    world interests me no end. The only trouble that I find with this growing
    awareness is that it con sists of merely words rather than actions. Meetings
    that present unified statements and sugges tions should be followed by ac
    tion. Before an individual tries to start an action lie should per haps
    decide upon a subject or an evil that needs improvement or rectification. I
    would like to sug gest a subject. As most Bucknellians know, this area is,
    socially speaking, highly backward. The town does nothing to help the
    college stu dent and the University does less. For this reason the students
    have been forced to accept the super ficialities of the fraternity system.
    What this school needs is a STU DENT UNION. Most schools have such places,
    and they add much to the general campus life and to the morale of the
    students. Parts of this building could contain | dance rooms, recreation -
    rooms, I snack bar, music listening rooms, record collections, and a restau
    rant. This weekend I was at Penn State and I spent two hours look- I ing
    through their student union, j the "Hub." I was amazed as I | turned each
    corridor to find the interest that the university has | taken in the life of
    the students, j Even though each student might I be, a number rather than a
    person in the school, he is still an im portant number and that, to me, is
    better than being a neglected person. I am sure that a question would be
    presented about funds for such a project. First, I would suggest | that it
    seems evident that the Li brary can now exist through its own endowment and
    that the funds now being spent on it could be diverted to such a project.
    Secondly, I am sure that if the I trustees would come arid look at I
    Bucknell, they would see reason for such a building. I understand that the
    place of a trustee is more concerned with the financial con dition than the
    others, but it must be realized that Bucknell is now a wheel without a "HUB"
    and that a hub would help to develop rhany of the. latent social possi
    bilities on campus. It is impos sible to hold jam sessions at pres ent, it
    is difficult to find suitable meeting places for clubs, and it is hard to
    imagine a University not attempting to aid the students with this problem.
    The needs that I mentioned are far from the only ones, but everybody could
    think of new reasons for the formation of such a unit. * I have been told
    that the Uni versity has been discussing the question for many years now. I
    wish that someone could present one valid argument for not build ing a
    union. Burt Kittay Editor's Note: MONEY! Dear Editor: During the past
    several weeks there has been much discussion, thought, and comment on the
    dis crimination issue. The degree of concern about this is now evi denced by
    the fact that the fac ulty has resolved that diversity among different
    religious and racial groups should be welcomed and considered essential. on
    the Bucknell campus and "that the University should be directly con cerned"
    in preventing discrimina tion. Students and faculty alike have shown concern
    by letters to Tli* Bucknellian and participation in last Thursday's debate,
    where over one tenth of the campus pop ulation crowded a fraternity house to
    discuss the issue. In view of this activity, the ad ministration has
    asserted its offi cial admissions policy of "neither discriminating for nor
    against" minority groups. But what about future University policy? Has there
    been any change in recruit ing procedures and attitudes, or will the trend
    toward the elimin ation of some minority groups on campus continue until we

    can be dragged on and hashed over for months, but it seems appropriate for
    the ad ministration to issue a statement at this time. The campus would like
    to know how the University will " be directly concerned" in preventing
    discrimination. What steps will be taken, relative to admissions procedures,
    to insure a diversified campus population? Sincerely, Rick Arnold

Content: Dear Editor: Immediately after Pearl Harbor was bombed, Congress was called into
    session by the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt. * He told the American
    people what had happened, and what we as a na tion were going to do about
    it. The people of the United Sthtes heard from their President, not their
    Vice-President or any other member of the administration, as to what our
    policy and course of action against our enemies was to be. To cite a more
    recent incident, let us recall the Little Rock epi sode. When it was
    apparent that the local and state officials of Ar kansas could no longer
    cope with the segregation problem (pardon the expression) former President
    Eisenhower saw fit to intervene. He took action because at the time he was.
    the leader of the United States. As President of this country, he could no
    longer remain silent. These two incidents of leader ship are not analagous
    to what should be taking place on this campus. In the last few issues of the

Heading: WORDS: THEIR CAUSE AND QURE
Content: Today let us take up the subject of etymology (or entomology, as it is sometimes
    called) which is the study of word origins (or insects, as they are
    sometimes called). Where are word origins (insects) to be found? Well sir,
    some* times words are proper names that have passed into the language. Take,
    for instance, the words used in electricity: ampere was named after its
    discoverer, the Frenchman Andre Marie Ampere (1775-1836); similarly ohm was
    named after the German G. S. Ohm (1781-1854), watt after the Scot James Watt
    (1736-1819), and bulb after the American Fred C. Bulb (1843-1912). There is,
    incidentally, quite a poignant little story about Mr. Bulb. Until Bulb's
    invention, all illumination was provided by gas, which was named after its
    inventor Milton T. Gas who, strange to tell, had been Bulb's roommate at Cal
    Tech! In fact, strange to tell, the third man sharing the room with Bulb and
    Gas was also one whose name burns bright in the annals of illumination--
    Walter Candle! The three roommates were inseparable companions in col- .
    lege. After graduation all three did research in the problem of artificial
    light, which at this time did not exist. All America used to go to bed with
    the chickens. In fact, many Americans were chickens. Well sir, the three
    comrades--Bulb, Gas, and Candle-- promised to be friends forever when they
    left school, but success, alas, spoiled all that. First Candle invented the
    candle, got rich, and forgot his old friends. Then Gas invented gas, got
    rich, bankrupted Candle, and forgot his old friends. Then Bulb in vented the
    bulb, got rich, bankrupted Gas, and forgot his old friends.

Heading: lief f a m e o v e r  M it?
Content: Candle and Gas, bitter and impoverished at the age respec tively of 75 and 71,
    went to sea as respectively the world's oldest and second oldest cabin boy.
    Bulb, rich and grand, also went to sea, but he went in style--as a first-
    class passenger on luxury liners. # Well sir, strange to tell, all three
    were aboard the ill-fated Lusitama when she was sunk in the North Atlantic.
    And, strange to tell, when they were swimming for their lives after the
    shipwreck, all three clambered aboard the same dinghy! Well sir, chastened
    and made wiser by, their brush with death, they fell into each other's arms
    and wept and exchanged for giveness and hefcume fast friends all over again.
    For three years they drifted in the dinghy, shaking hands and singing the
    Cal Tech rouser all the while. Then, at long last, they spied a passing
    liner and were taken aboard. They remained fast friends for the rest of
    their days, which, I regret to report, were not many, because the liner
    which picked them up was the Titanic. What a pity that Marlboros were not
    invented during the lifetimes of Bulb, Gas, and Candle! Had there been
    Marlboros, these three friends never would have grown apart because they
    would have known how much, despite their differences, they still had in
    common. I mean to say that Marlboros can be lit by candle, by gas, or by
    electricity, and no matter how you light them, you always get a full-
    flavored smoke, a filter cigarette with an unfiltered taste that makes
    anyone--including Bulb, Gas, and Candle--settle back and forget anger and
    strife and smile the sweet smile of friendship on all who pass 1 , (c)  1961

Content: FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1961.

Heading: At the Movies
Content: by Joel Flegler Most critics were not favorably impressed by The Misfits, nor
    were most students with whom I spoke. There is no doubt that The Misfits is
    a strange film; there is no other motion picture that is anything like it.
    One needs only to look at the combination of tal ents used in the making of
    it to know he is going to see some thing different. But what does one find
    here? Only a story about ordinary human beings, all hav ing faults and
    virtues; this is the major problem. We have become so used to seeing
    stereotyped characters and situations on the screen that when "the misfits"
    come along, it is difficult to ac custom oneself to them. If the power of
    The Misfits had to be attributed to a single force, this force would be the
    words of Arthur Miller, for he has some thing important to say. We are all
    searching for the meaning of life. If there is one, few of us find it, and
    perhaps it can only be found through the understanding, kindness and love of
    human re lationships. Mr. Miller uses all his characters to express his phi
    losophy, but in no one is this more obvious than in Rosalind, the unifying
    factor of the entire movie. Rosalind is so beautifully play ed by Miss
    Monroe that I wonder at the competence of the critics, who, after watching
    her in this film, say that she cannot act. She captures attention in every
    scene which she plays, but this was meant to be. Gable, Wallach, and Clift,
    in short, have never been better. Each handles his role with such sincerity
    that they overwhelm one with their natur alism, and with the expert direc
    tion of John Huston and the per fectly placed music of Alex North, all help
    create an outstanding movie that is at once bold, fresh, and exciting. From
    beginning to end, The Misfits glows with a vitality that never, not for a
    single moment, diminishes in its intensity. Each individual is portrayed
    with such depth and feeling that, when he is on the screen, one has little
    time or desire .to think of other characters. This is a motion pic ture that
    does not make one think afterwards about other people, but about himself. I
    can, there fore, think of no higher praise to offer The Misfits than to say
    that it belongs among the finest Amer ican films ever produced. Man at desk
    to himself: "I wish I had a dental; appointment to cancel--that always
    brightens my aav."

    a lecture given last Mon. night by Dr. S. J. Idzerda, humanist scholar and

Content: During the last two centuries, however, "the words 'artist' and 'alienation*
    have become synony mous." The artist is generally characterized by such
    terms as >>poor, eccentric, and of low mor ality. The essence of his aliena
    tion lies in the fact that he must struggle to maintain the integrity of his
    work, and that he frequent ly lowers his * standards or nounces art
    entirely. Four Causes | Dr. Idzerda cited four main ' causes of this
    alienation. The first was the rapid growth of science and its application to
    technology. The analytic char acter of science, as well as its "naive
    rationalism and naive em piricism," creates an atmosphere hostile to art,
    which is essentially unanalytic, ineffable, and intang ible. Moreover,
    scientific devel opment encourages specialization of functions and division
    of labor and the artist or craftsman be comes "antiquarian, or merely cute."
    A second cause cited by Mr. Idzerda was the rise of the middle class. In
    addition to its role as chief supporter of scientism, the conservative
    attitude of this class causes it to value .the more tra ditional forms of
    art, and to op pose innovation. Art objects may be prized . as symbols of
    social position, but, are unlikely to be valued for their inherent worth.
    The growth of literacy, Dr. Id zerda stat0d, was a third cause of the
    artist's alienation. Art criticism, iconology, and art his tory, made widely
    available through developments in printing, have, to a large extent, taken
    the place of art itself. Finally, democ- *(Continued on Page 8) a t ~

    whether they personal ly felt that there was an issue of discrimination at

    issue. De fining this issue, however, was another matter. H.e stated that
    Bucknell UMversity was not de liberately preventing the admis sion of Negro
    students. However, the issue might be defined in terms of the extent to
    which the UMversity should go to encour age more Negroes to apply. Bigoted

    sociological defini tion of discrimination: sorting people into categories
    and treat ing them differently, as groups,j with regard to membership in |
    such organizations as uMversities : or fraternities^ Generalized group
    characteristics outweigh rndivid- ual qualifications. He added that there
    was discrimination for, as well as against. There is discrim ination at
    Bucknell in regard to how one should act m respect to goals and means to
    goals. The students are guilty in little and big issues. Because some are
    for and some are against discrimin ation in the fratermty system, there is
    an issue. Since "there is contention in and among the members of the
    administration, there is an issue. The faculty has narrow vote margins on
    discus sions of the topic, so there is sin issue there too. Speaking for the
    admissions of- Rcpresentalive Student Body Mr. Horlacher continued by j
    discussing the question of whether i or not Bucknell has a representa- ;
    tive student body. Since Buck- 1 nell students have a higher IQ j than the
    national average, come | from families with above average j incomes, make
    their homes iin ! Northeastern United States and | lack the same religious
    or racial composition as the nation, it can- not be said that they have a
    rep resentative student body. Such a representation would be more desirable,
    as association is necessary to cope with problems j that srrise over
    situations involv ing race and religion. In order to encourage these
    minority groups to come to Bucknell, scholarships would have to be more
    plentiful and trntion would | consequently have to be raised, j There would
    also be a lowering of standards for Negro applicants and for students from
    California. In other words .there would have to be discrimination FOR these
    ! people, and the majority group would be discriminated against. Mr. Zeller
    picked up Mr. Hor- i lacher's words by commenting | that the question at
    Bucknell is: I How far out of the way should we | go for the Negroes? He
    added ; that religion is a similar issue. Is religion completely irrelevant?
    Some say that it is irrelevant, j while others believe that this is a
    Christian institution Etnd should I be maintamed as such. Now, Mr. Walling
    expressed I the opiMon that the aim of the University weis to take the best
    possible students. LowerMg the | standards would be discrimina tion for,
    Which is just as evil as any other discrimination.________

    manufactures the switching systems which connect some 60-million BeH
    telephones throughout the U. S. The average call over today's
    electromechanical system requires 420 relay operations. All together, this
    intercon necting eqMpment makes up the heart of what is, in effect, the
    world's largest machine. That's where Western Electric and you come in. The
    switching equipment for this "machine" involves an enormous manufactur ing
    job carried on by our plants throughout the country. Because of the- size
    and service requirements involved, we require quality standards far
    exceeding those of ordinary manufacturing. The size of this job presents an
    unusual challenge to the engineer who may save the Bell System many
    thousands of dollars by even a small cost-reduction step. While today's
    switching calls for a priority on engineering, tomorrow's will be even more
    exciting. For even now the revolutionary Elec tronic CentrEil Office is
    under field trial and promises to remake the world of telephony. Future

Heading: Thought-provokingArticles
Content: The March issue of Bucknell Review, the University's scholar ly journal of arts,
    letters and science, contain six thought-pro voking articles, including two
    by. members of the faculty. Dr. Charles M. Bond, professor of religion,
    emeritus, speaks out on the perversion of biblical lit erature by many modem
    authors and dramatists in an article en titled J. B. Is Not Job. Using
    Archibald MacLeish's book "J. B." as an example, Dr. Bond cites several
    differences between Mac Leish's play and the Book of Job to illustrate that
    the ancient bib lical drama and the modem adaptation are not the same. Some
    of the fundamental dif ferences between poetry and other literature are
    explained by Dr. Harold E. Cook, professor of music, in his article on The
    Musi' cality of Poetry". According to Dr. Cook, poetry contains pitch,
    rhythm, harmony and timbre, the four elemental properties of | music, which
    are not found in other literature.

Heading: Role
Content: We note with pleasure the vanishing of an inferiority complex that has plagued
    Bucknell for years. There has, in the past, been a general lack of pride in
    Bucknell among both faculty and students, and the question, "Why did you
    ever come here?" has been asked on this campus all too often. Freshmen are
    disillusioned by the lack of "school spirit" and the fact that Bucknell is
    too near, in some respects, to the idyllic American college delineated by
    our advertising culture, and too far from it in others. Saturated with trite
    pictures of football heroes in letter sweaters hand in hand with a campus
    queen and with stories of undying devotion for one's school, we have felt
    that we lack a uniqueness or personality as a university. We are not
    overwhelmed by picturesque traditions, but is # the absence of this sort of
    thing a real loss? More significant causes for feeling inferior have been
    low standards among both faculty and students. We have had poor teachers,
    plenty of "Ivy-league rejects," and poor academic programs in some fields.
    The lack of di rection among many of pur students is superimposed on our
    idea of the university as a whole. Bucknell has been a school stuffed with
    post-high school students who sought to go to college in the "American
    tradition." In the past several years, this inferiority complex has begun to
    vanish. If it is not because we are now one of the top schools in the
    country, it is because we are obvi ously well on our way to being a
    thoroughly respectable one. There is great cause to be proud of a school
    that is so distinctly on the rise, as is Bucknell. The quality of the
    faculty and the academic program at Bucknell con tinues to improve. Our
    admission standards would em- barass few American colleges. The lack of
    direction on a sleepy campus is disappearing. Bucknell is awake; it may
    still be stretching and yawning, but it is determined to be a first-class
    uniiversity. We are in a stage of transition. We are revising every thing
    from the curriculum to student government. We have serious students who are
    determined to utilize their capacities to the fullest. We have notable
    visiting lectur ers, valuable educational and social programs such as
    Challenge and Burma-Buckaell Weekend, and first rate performing artists. We
    are losing our old role as an aca demic country club, .and assuming a new
    role as a com petent educational institution. We do not mean to imply that
    Bucknell has any reason to rest on its laurels, but simply to point out that
    we have much on which to pride ourselves.

Content: 

Heading: For Whom?
Content: The work of the Bureau of Placement at Bucknell is growing in importance, for it
    is through this bureau that many students expect to find satisfactory jobs
    after they graduate. It seems, however, that not all students re ceive an
    equal opportunity for job interviews, for the Bu reau appears to cater to
    business and natural science stu dents. (The department of education has its
    own place ment bureau). But what guidance aid is provided for the student
    with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English or phy- choiogy, who may, for
    example, be interested in a career in journalism or advertising? It is clear
    that Bucknell, an independent liberal arts col lege, has no special
    responsibility to recruit more teachers for the public schools, more
    engineers and scientists or more management trainees for any particular
    industry. While individual faculty members may support special programs--
    usually graduate study in their own fields-- the college, generally, and the
    placement director, specif ically, should not be identified with any special
    occupa tional interest. We realize that it is the task of the student with a
    gen eral liberal arts background to specify his future occupa tional
    interests. The Placement Bureau, however, has failed to provide many of the
    graduating seniors with competent assistance and guidance through
    appropriate placement activities. One may,argue that advertising firms and
    publishing houses have such limited demands for new graduates that they see
    no necessity in represent ing themselves at Bucknell Generally speaking,
    most job opportunities are publiciz ed via the "mass medium" or a single
    bulletin board in the rear of the book store. Occasionally, personal notices
    supplement the lists on the bulletin board. We suggest the institution of a
    system to provide advance publicity of all impending job "recruiters" for
    seniors whose fields of study correspond to the types of jobs available.
    Would it not be possible to classify each senior student according to his
    field of study and send him a mimeo graphed list of the firms interviewing
    for jobs relevant to his field? Since a majority of the firms are scheduled
    in advance by the Placement Bureau, a temporary program could be compiled
    listing the expected arrival of the rep resentatives at Bucknell.
    Publicizing interview dates in this manner would not only be advantageous to
    the stu dent, but would save a great deal of time for the em ployees of the
    Placement Bureau. Individual notification of senior students would enable
    them to be more selective in their choice of job offers and would provide
    better in surance'for their future occupational satisfaction.

Heading: BASEBALL SCHEDULE
Content: 1961 by Wally Seward PBSCC The Bucknell Sports Car Club will hold its first
    outdoor event of the spring season this Sunday afternoon. Starting at
    Coleman Hall parking lot at 2 p. m. a meas ured distance predicted speed
    rally will feature hidden time check points over an unmarked course that
    will take approxi mately two and one-half hours to complete. The purpose and
    idea behind an event of this sort, unlike a regular road race, is not to run
    the given distance at maximum I speed, but rather to complete the I course
    at a speed as near as pos sible to that which has been pre-1 viously
    determined by another j pace car marks the initial speed I at a point well
    below the legal maximum so that only the ability of the driver and navigator
    is tested, rather than the endurance of the car. In order to make the I
    event more challenging, contest- i ants are not allowed the use of a | road
    map, etc., but are allowed to j use only a gven set of instruc-1 tions
    provided by the rally com- j mittee which cites landmarks, I road signs, and
    the like at which j changes in speed and direction will be made. The
    navigator serves a very immediate need in that through out the event he must
    keep a run ning account of the total distance are important, not the
    handling ability nor the maximum speed of the car. Oddly enough the whole
    sports car club has been issued a challenge by the owner of a '61 Chevy
    Convertible. All cars are invited to partici pate, regardless of vintage. In
    order to encourage participation, the Club will award trophies for the
    drivers and navigators of the winning cars. ' The suggested equipment for an
    event of this sort includes: a navigator, (male or female), a watch with a
    sweep second hand, a clip board or other writing surface, and a pencil (or
    more) and paper. Optional equip ment includes: a slide rule, sun glasses,
    etc. # No electronic or otherwise computers, please! In order to alleviate
    some of our expenses we must also ask that non-members of the club make an
    entrance donation of $2. How ever, I believe all entrants will find the
    enjoyment and pleasure well worth the time. Sat., Apr. 8--L ehigh

    claim to fame is that he was the first Bucknellian to ever roll a 300 game

    can- | didates for thin-clad honors. Among the athletes were four let- j
    termen: Marty Holmes, Sibby Scialabba, Steve Magoon, and Dick Boddie. Coach
    Blum ex pects his four mainstays to be the backbone of the 1961 squad.
    Holmes is the Bison's best man in the distance evfents, last season
    recording the team's best times in j the mile and two mile runs, j Marty's
    best times were 4:53.0 and 10:46.0 * in the respective events. | I Scialabba
    is a promising pole i vaulter, his best vault last season | being 11' 6" .
    Magoon Top Sprinter Steve Magoon was the Bison's j j leading sprinter,
    recording times j j of 10.6 in the 100-yard dash; and 24.3 in the 220-yard
    dash- This! j year, Steve will also complete in j the mile relay. Dick
    Boddie was I | the Bison's workhorse last sea son, leading the team to a 4-2
    rec ord, while participating in four events. Dick's efforts featured I times
    of 16.6 in the 120-yard high hurdles, 27.5 in the 220-yard low hurdles, a
    high jump of 6' and a j broad jump of 22' 1%", Dick j will also participate
    in the mile relay event. Twelve Sophs Coach Blum's plans for this sea- M A R
    T Y  HOLM ES son call for the use of the 12 sophomore candidates. Among the
    sophomores are Art Lemkau, a javelin thrower; Bart DiChiara, a pole vaulter;
    Jeff Martin, a dis tance runner; Buzz Holmes, a sprinter; and Art Michaelis
    and Jack O'Dell, both specialists in the field events. The most im pressive
    juniors are Bob DeCamp, a half-mile runner, and Cap Weil and Ron Andreuzzi,
    both hurd lers. With a definite lack of reserves, Coach Blum expects this to
    be a rough season. He believes that Lafayette is one of the East's
    powerhouses and will definitely be the Bison's roughest opponent. j Delta
    Upsilon is still clinging to : a precarious 14 point lead in the race for
    the All-Year Intramural ! Trophy. They led by nine at the I end of thee

Heading: Fraternities Have Lost
Content: 

Heading: Purpose: A Challenge!
Content: by Carole Dunham Based on an article in the Delta Zeta 'Lamp'. The unashamed
    concern with things of the intellect that infect ed significant numbers of
    students of war vintage seems rather rare on state university campuses to
    day. Where the fraternities and sororities of 15 years ago often took on a
    richer texture and a wider dimension through the in tellectual commitments
    of many of their members, orgaanized houses of today are sometimes pockets
    of stubborn intellectual apathy. Alumni of the days when home coming
    decorations were con structed at the cost of six hilari ous man-hours plus
    $10 worth of cardboard and lathe a day before the game-- and who expected to
    win the prize anyway?--are often shocked at the energy, intensity, and
    highly organized efficiency with which their houses now pur sue extra-
    curricular prizes and trophies. The tendency of fraternities' to cver-
    organize the lives of their members has increased, alumni will find, as have
    those endless house and interhouse committees devoted to trivia unrelated to
    the purpose of a university. The pressures toward "herd behavior," always
    present in Greek houses, are no longer subtle, and the frantic concern of
    many houses to be "known on campus" has re sulted in an unhealthy stress on
    "activities per se" . The extra ordinary devotion of some Greek houses to
    the social aspects of life has become a byword. Time-Consuming All of these
    kinds of activity combine, by sheer weight of the lime they consume, to
    vitiate the intellectual development of the fraternity member and thereby to
    subvert the fundamental aims of a university. The development of the
    Student's mind and judg ment, the opportunity for him to penetrate his
    cultural heritage, and all -of the prepaations he must make, in areas both
    humane and technical, to live intelligently in a complex and dangerous
    world, are relegated to a few fugitive hours each week. Greek students, bv
    their own testimony, often come to feel lucky if they can throw together any
    kind of written work before the class deadline; to present a pgper
    thoroughly researched, j carefully argued, and rewritten for style and
    precision of lan guage would require more hours than the student has
    available-- unless he bypasses a skit rehears al, Friday and Saturday night

Content: stay and try i j to fight it?" are the invariable i questions they ask. Original
    Purpose Greek-letter organizations are not intentionally anti-intellectual;
    they were founded to strengthen bonds with the alma mater, and those 19th
    century founders un derstood and respected the aims of their universities.
    Yet through the years fraternities hvae drift ed away from their primary
    ideals and have become so entangled with secondary aims that today they
    sometimes seem almost com pletely divorced from the vital spirit of the
    universities to which they profess allegiance. This divorce perhaps reflects
    the divided mind of our society concerning the value of intellect- ual
    experiences. Certainly parents and secondary schools fail to send us many
    students who have firm standards for intellectual achieve ment; our freshmen
    are charming I young people, already adhering I to well-defined criteria of
    dress i and manners, but often innocent of any desire for serious encount
    ers with ideas. Leadership Responsibility This fact does not absolve fra
    ternity leadership from responsi bility for' some of the current
    estrangement of the fraternity j system from the central prpose of our
    universities. Too often | fraternity leaders have supposed | that their
    major obligation to the | universities is discharged by the i appointment,
    of scholarship chair- | men, locally and nationally, who | in turn feel they
    function proper- j ly if they make occasional exhor- j tations concerning
    higher grade | point averages. Such a limited approach does not penetrate <
    to the core of the problem; even.the j narrow demand for respectable I
    chapter averages will be pointless j until whole attitudes- and at-
    jmospheres are changed so that ! serious academic work may then - flourish.

Content: by Joel Flegler Although the Indian motion pic ture industry releases more films
    avery year than Hollywood, most jf them are considered too in ferior to be
    shown here. But with Satyajit Ray's world re nowned trilogy, Pather Panchali
    (1956), Aparajito (1957, and The World of Apu (1960), Western moviegoers
    have had the chance to see the work of a master ar- | waking up Apu, the
    Aunt's ex- | pression when she gives up all j hope of anyone wanting her, or
    j Apu's first moments alone with his bride. All this is filmed with !what
    might be described as an !almost primitive type of photog- j raphy, a deeply
    sensitive style | that adds more realism to the I drama. The lagging pace of
    the I movies, difficult to adjust to at | first, seems slow only in compari-
    j son to other films; Ray creates a unique, relaxed, and appealing 'mood
    that is sustained through out the film.

    " Tell me," he cried, "are you a girl of expensive tastes?" " No, hey," she
    cried, " I am a girl of simple tastes." "Good," he cried, " for my cruel
    father sends me an allowance barely large enough to support life." " Money
    does not matter to me," she cried. " My tastes are simple, my wants are
    few.. Just, take me riding in a long, new, yellow convertible and I am
    content." "Goodbye," he cried, and ran away as fast as his chubby little
    legs could carry him, for he had no convertible, nor the money to buy one,
    nor the means to get the money, short of picking up his stingy father by the
    ankles and shaking him till his wallet fell out. He knew he must forget tins
    girl but, lying on his pallet at the dormitory, whimpering and moaning, he
    knew he could not. At last an idea came to him: though he did not have the
    money to buy a convertible, perhaps he had enough to rent one! Hope reborn,
    he rushed at once to an automobile rental company and rented a yellow
    convertible for $10 down plus 10^ a mile, and with many a laugh and cheer
    drove away to pick up the girl. "Oh, goody," she said when she saw the car.
    "This suits my simple tastes to a 'T'. Come, let us speed over rolling
    highways and through bosky dells." And away they drove. All that day and
    night they drove and finally, tired but happy, they parked high on a
    windswept hill. " Marlboro?" he said. "Yum yum,"  she said. They lit up.
    They puffed with deep contentment. "You know," he said, "you are like a
    Marlboro--mild and fresh and relaxing." " But there is a big difference
    between Marlboro and me," she said, " because I do not have a Selectrate
    filter nor do I come in soft pack or flip-top box." They laughed. They
    kissed. He screamed. " What is it, my dear," she cried, alarmed. " Look at
    the speedometer," he said. " We have driven 200 miles and this car costs 10p
    a mile and I have only $20 left." " But that's exactly enough," she said. "
    Yes," l>e said, " but we still have to drive home," They fell into a
    profound gloom. He started the motor and backed out of the parking place.
    Hey, look! ' she said. " The speedometer doesn't move when you're backing
    up." He looked. It was true. " Eureka!" he cried. "That solves my problem. I
    will drive home in reverse. Then no more miles will register on the
    speedometer and I will have enough money to pay!" - * *" I think that's a
    marvelous idea," she said, and she was right. Because today our hero is in
    the county jail wiiere food, clothes and lodging are provided free of charge
    and his allowance is piling up so fast that he will have enough money to
    take his girl riding again as soon as he is released. (c) 1961 Mtu Shulmaa *

Content: by Dick Tidier After delays which were, for the most part, beyond my control, I
    once again sit down to write another article for the Bucknellian. Many of
    you have expressed a desire to see more of these articles in print, and so I
    shall try to comply with your wishes. Thank you for your comments and also
    for your articles. I thought I would devote this article to the reasons for
    my com ing to Bucknell and to my future plans. I also hope that, after read
    ing this aritcle, some of you may have comments or suggestions to make
    concerning what I have to say. Almost from the first day in school I had a
    desire to attend col lege and to learn as much as I possibly could. However,
    it was not until almost the beginning of my senior year in high school that
    I began to have any particular preference as to the college .1 wished to
    attend. I knew that I would prefer to attend a small college where I could
    obtain a good education. Attendance at a smaller college would also have the
    advantage of affording more opportunities to meet people. I felt that I
    would like to attend a college where some one like me had not recently, or
    perhaps had never attended. As it happened, Bucknell was to be the place
    where I would continue my education. Math Major All through my secondary
    education, my major interest was mathematics. My father's work involves
    mathematics and I guess I inherited the interest from him. Mother asserts
    that her interests were no\ so inclined. I felt that if given the
    opportunity to continue my education, I would major in mathematics. Thus, I
    now find my self as a mathematics major at Bucknell. One of the major aims
    of the University is to instill in the stu dent a desire to pursue knowledge
    --truth. Already I have found that Bucknell offers one such an opportunity
    to pursue knowledge if one so desires. However, I am also aware of the fact
    that four years is a rather brief time to spend .in this pursuit. I could
    very easily add an additional four years of courses I would like to take,
    and perhaps with each new course this number would increase. However,
    fortunately or unfortunately, depending upon which way one looks at the
    situation, one must also prepare for future em ployment after those brief
    four years. You probably wonder what I intend to do? Teaching Mathematics At
    this moment I can see two possibilities for me. I would like to be able to
    either teach mathematics, or to work with mathematics in industry. If
    teaching should be my future, I would enjoy teach- j ing higher mathematics.
    A few years ago there probably would have | been some opportunities for a
    teacher of mathematics iin the various j schools for the blind in the United
    States. However in recent years, with the trend of capable blind students
    continuing their education I in "sighted schools," there only remains, in
    many instances, the j teaching of elementary math in such schools. I believe
    I would much rather prefer teaching in a normal school j if possible. I
    realize that there will be many problems for me in j teaching in a public
    school, but I do not feel that the prospective j problems would find no
    solutions. I have already mentioned in a previous article that there have
    been blind teachers in the fields of | physics and mathematics, and I should
    like to have the opportunity I to join that number. I would be interested in
    your reactions or comments upon such an undertaking. Perhaps some of you may
    have suggestions upon possible teaching methods I could use. If so, I would
    appreciate dis- cussing them with you. I would also appreciate hearing what
    your reactions might be if you walked into a class to find me, or someone
    like me, as the teacher. . Statistical W orker The other .possibility for me
    in the field of mathematics after j graduation is working as a statistician
    or in some other mathematic ally oriented employment. This possibility has
    just recently been made known to me, and perhaps such employment might prove
    more feasible than teaching. I shall be taking my first statistics course
    next year, and perhaps after this course I shall be in a better position for
    evaluating the possibilities of employment. And thus it stands. Whether I
    shall become a teacher of mathe matics, or work in industry with mathematics
    remains for the future to reveal.

Content: by Liz Atkinson On March 9-10 the Bucknell University Artist Series brought
    ballet to Lewisburg. The Zachary Solov. Ballet Ensemble performed three
    ballets for a predominately student audience at the Lewis burg High School.
    The three ballets presented on each of the two nights are said to be in the
    repertory of no other dance com panies; after having seen the per formance,
    this statement is not difficult to believe. The first ballet on the program,
    Chez Tchaikovsky, impressions of the of the Russian composer a hun dred
    years ago--the gracious so cial life, the dreams of a poet's secret mind,
    and the hearty pleas ures of a rustic winter. The theme and the choreography
    for this ballet were basically well ed the effect of classical ballet.. The
    fluffy, short white tutues- did not make up for the poor timing and awkward
    gestures, of most of the dancers. Ballet is for the most part, a play
    without words. The dancers are required to "tell" their story through body
    movement and facial expression. Only Orpheus, the second of the three
    repertoires danced by the company succeeded in following these requirements.
    Michael Maule, the male lead of the ballet, danced the role of depicted the
    ' Orpheus. Orpheus according to young w orld; ancient Greek legend, overcome
    by the death of his young wife, is granted the privilege of going to the
    underworld and heavenly fields of Elysium to find her spirit and bring her
    back to life and happiness. To test the greatness of his love, designed, but

    convincing as the Happy Spirit who tries to help Orpheus regain his wife
    from death. Her technique and graceful execution of steps were excellent
    however. Some of the ballerinas in Orpheus although lacking in grace and
    skill should not themselves be blamed, for the choreographer Solov and the
    costume designer did not facilitate easy move ments. The costume worn by the
    unfortunate ballerina who "danced" the role of the Angel of Death, was
    binding and cumber some. Heavy plastic wings strapped to her back allowed no
    j opportunity for torso motion; a j black veiling covering her face | and

Content: 424-426 Market St. Phone JA 4-3721 As the communications needs of our nation
    become steadily greater and more complex, the Bell Telephone System is
    continuing its pioneer work in microwave by "taking to the air" more and
    more to get the word across. To this end, Western Electric--the manu
    facturing arm of the Bell System--has the monumental task of producing a
    large part of the microwave transmission equipment that knits our country
    together by shrinking thou sands of miles into mere seconds. In spite of its
    great technological strides, the science of radio relay is a rapidly-
    changing one. And new break-throughs and advances are common occurrences. A
    case in point: our Bell System "TH" Microwave Radio Relay. This newest
    development in long-distance telephone transmission will eventually triple
    the present message-carrying capacity of exist ing long-haul radio relay
    installations. A full- scale system of 6 working and 2 protection channels
    can handle 11,000 telephone mes sages at the same time. To make microwave
    work takes a host of special equipment and components: relay towers,
    antennae, waveguides, traveling wave- tubes, transistors, etc. But just as
    important, it takes top-caliber people to help us broaden our horizons into
    such exciting new areas as communication by satellites! And microwave is
    only' part of Western Electric's opportunity story. We have--right now-
    hundreds of challenging and rewarding positions in virtually all areas of
    telephony, as well as in development and building of defense communications
    and missile guidance systems for the Government. So, if your future is "up
    in the air," you owe it to your career to see "what's up" for you at Western
    Electric. Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus trial, civil
    and chemical engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, and
    business majors. For more information, get your copy o f "Western Electric

    Mr. Jay will also bring with him a working model of the ve hicle in order to
    demonstrate how Levacar functions. According to Ford officials, Levacar
    could conceivably attain speeds upwards of 500 miles per hour while using
    nominal power. Reduced frictional drag and the corresponding reduction in
    power required to drive the vehicle are the reasons given for achieving such
    speeds.

Content: by Bob Scott As a result of the recent acci dents and the driving habits ob
    served on and near campus by | Bucknell students, the Men's Ju- dicial Board
    wishes to have pub- i lished this recommendation and j announcement. First,
    it has been recommended.; to the IFC that all fraternities be j asked to
    stress safe driving habits, * and that coffee be served, or made !
    available, one-half hour before | | the end of all social functions dur- j
    ing which alcoholic beverages I were consumed. Second,' the Men's Judicial
    Board will review j j all cases involving the following: Driving under the
    influence of al-1 cohol, or reckless and careless driving. If, after
    reviewing such | a case, the Judicial Board deems it necessary, it will
    recommend the suspension of driving privi-1 leges for those concerned.

    The Dragon is ' a symbol of | anger and madness to the Bur mese people, and
    is really in very poor taste. It denotes supersti tion to the Burmese and
    they take it much more seriously than as just a "decoration." -i I took it
    upon myself to men tion this to the head of the Chair man of the Burma-
    Bucknell Com- j mittee before the dragon was j actually used, and my
    suggestions | were ignored. Many of my fellow Burmese I students on campus
    share this feeling with me and would like'to | suggest that in the future a
    Pea cock, a much more appropriate symbol, be used. Respectfully yours, Kyaw
    Khin $ * # To The Men of Bucknell: I have been selected to run for the MSG
    Judical Board by the j present members. I shpuld like to say that I feel
    quite honored that they have thought me worthy of this opportunity. I am not
    writing this letter as a vote-getting plea for myself, but rather to present
    my point of view towards certain conditions which now exist on campus. Nu
    merous decisions have been made by Boards in the past concerning
    disciplinary matters here at school which, in the opinions of some, have
    been both too punitive and too harsh. My opinions in 'this matter axe both
    unimportant and irrelevant, but what is important is the fact that Judicial
    Board is without a doubt a much talked-about and controversial organization.
    It is not my purpose here to condemn the Judicial Board as an ill-func
    tioning institution, but rather to stress its importance. It is with out a'
    doubt the most important branch of MCG, and should not be dismissed lightly.
    As I said before, I am not writ ing this comment to procure your votes, but
    rather to arouse you to the significance of this election this coming
    Wednesday. Do not think of it as just one of "those" elections to be passed
    over light ly, but GET OUT AND VOTE. Sincerely yours, Jon Portnbf, 1962

    only regret after seeing these films is that they leave an unquenchable
    desire to see Apar- ajito. i

Content: The results of the Area Tests of the Graduate Record Examina tion^, given to the
    Class of 1961 on Feb. 21, have been released by Dean Karl D. Hartzell. Three
    hundred and ninety-fire students participated in the tests given in the
    morning session, in the fields of the social sciences, the humanities, and
    the natural sciences. Afternoon tests were given in specific areas of study.
    Information from these tests will be used to evaluate the standing of the
    students, both in their own class and on the na tional level, and also to
    evaluate departmental and the University standards. In comparing the scores
    of the Classes of 1959 and 1960 with the most recent scores, it has been
    noted that the aver age scores are higher this year. There were gains of 15
    points in the Humanities Test and 28 points in the Natural Science Test. In
    these two tests the seniors scored above the national group, which included
    students from 21 colleges selected by the Educational Test ing Service.
    However, they scor ed slightly lower in the Social Science Test.

Heading: Intellect or Bust!
Content: It has recently been pointed out that Bucknell s stand ards are rapidly being
    raised. The students are better qualified, the faculty more capable, and the
    academic pro gram more challenging. On these bases, Bucknell could compete
    with many of the country's top ranking schools; but Bucknell is weak in one
    respect. The role of the university in American society is that of
    developing capable, mature and potentially useful citi zens. Bucknell
    students may rank with the most capable, but we doubt that they rank with
    the most mature. They are potentially useful, but at Bucknell, are not
    acquiring the sort of motivations, desires and interests that would make
    them more prominent citizens. A college freshman is a very malleable person.
    He comes to school not know ing exactly what he is going to experience, or
    what role he will play (as our freshman counselers can testify). Bucknell
    has the opportunity to mold these individuals, but it does not. The very
    atmosphere of the campus could promote interest in world politics, the
    meaning of educa tion, the role of the engineer in our society, or the
    future of labor, simply by association and absorption. We fail, however, to
    fulfill this aspect of our responsibility. A college student may choose to
    be an intellectual, orienting his college experience primarily toward the de
    velopment of his mind; or he may be a diletante, with his attention divided
    among his studies, social and extra-cur ricular activities, and athletics.
    Bucknell life is geared toward the diletante. To be sure, it is a pleasant
    experi ence to approach what Bucknell has to offer as a bee ap proaches
    flowers, but to do this is to miss a great oppor tunity. The chance to
    devote one's self intensely to in tellectual activity is a rare and valuable
    opportunity, and one which all too many of us forego. Such activity has a
    valuable effect upon one's character as well as his mmd. It affects the
    motivations and values of the individual. It develops individuality and
    authenticity of the self. It is a refining influence. People invest in
    higher education, not only because it gives professional training, but also
    because it is one of the best opportunities society has of developing the
    character- of its members. It is in this intellectual realm where Bucknell
    lags be hind its potential. Our social structure, our extra-curric ular
    activities, even our students, are geared to diletant- ism. We become like a
    high class, co-educational sum mer camp, with plenty of social
    opportunities, arts and crafts. Such experience is valuable, but it is not
    what college was meant to be. We are cheating not only so ciety and the
    people that invest in us; we are cheating ourselves. It is time for
    intellectualism to become a mat ter of pride on this campus. We must--and we
    can--be come more than we are, by applying our resources more intensely.

    tiicular reference to the article 'Placement--For Whom?" In January the

    companies that would be recruiting on cam pus with the date and the degrees
    that the company was interested in recruiting. Every student who registers
    with the placement bureau is classified according to his educa tion and

    interviews to take. The author of the article I am criticizing woud probably

Heading: To Tell the Truth
Content: We, the new Editorial Board of the Bucknellian, look ahead to a year of great
    responsibility--the responsibility of keeping some 2,500 students, faculty,
    and other readers informed. Our task has been defined for us by previous
    editorial boards, and our goal must be the maintenance or enhancement of the
    present quality of this publication. In the coming months we will attempt to
    present you, our readers, with the facts--not as one individual (or even one
    group) sees them, but as conscientious investigation proves them valid. We
    feel that misrepresentation of the facts, or an inadequate presentation of
    facts, is definitely out of keeping with our policy of honesty and fairness.
    Realizing that in order to be effective, a campus news paper must serve as a
    mouthpiece for student, faculty, and administrative opinion, the Bucknellian
    staff invites# its readers to submit information and opinions. We also
    welcome constructive criticism, for we feel that your ideas and views may
    help us to better fulfill our responsi bility to readers on and off tiqe
    campus.

    Bucknellian: Purpose: To report to the fresh man class and the campus in
    general of the organization of the Freshman Inter-dormitory Council (FIDO.
    The FIDC was proposed as a group which would function as a go-between from
    the freshman class officers to the individual class members. On Feb. 9,
    1961, presidents and vice presidents of the freshman dormitories and ;
    houses met with the four class of- j fleers in room 202 of Bertrand Li- | I
    brary to decide if such a group should exist and how it should [function.
    Those assembled un-j I animously voted it into existence, ['and several
    policies were decided. 1. Dr. Hollister was chosen as I class advisor. (He
    has since then agreed to accept this position for | the class of 1964).

Heading: I
Content: 2. It was decided that the Freshman Social Committee j should operate under the
    FIDC j and should handle the responsi-1 bilities for the freshman class
    project, decorating the annex of the gym for the Senior Prom, and also take
    charge of refreshments. 3. All subsequent meetings of FIDC wiH be announced
    in the Butknellian pending their ap proval (next meeting is April 4) and
    will be open to anyone who has an interest. 4. Other points included the
    tentative planning of a class meeting for April 6, purchase of class
    stationery, and mutual cor respondence with freshman class presidents at
    Penn State and Del aware universities. It is the'hope of FIDC members that
    our group, which is in . ac tuality a class council, will be continued from
    year to year until graduation. We realize that this group may be organized
    at a late date, but it is a beginning, per haps, of great things to come for
    Bucknell, and the class of 1964. Gratefully, Leland J. Adams, Jr. Dear
    Editor: I am afraid that I must disagree strongly with your editorial titled
    Placement--For Whom? in the I March 17 Bucknellian. I do not think that
    there is any substantial basis for your opinion that the Placement Bureau,
    and | the Placement Director in partie- | ular, is catering to any one group
    j of graduating seniors such as the i business and natural science stu
    dents. Although I am not a graduating senior, I have had in timate contact
    with the Place ment Bureau while seeking a summer job. Through this asso
    ciation I have come to know the [*general procedure of this office I
    reasonably well. It is true that most job oppor- j tunities are publicized
    only by I the bulletin board in the waiting j room of the Placement Bureau,
    * but what better way is there to ! communicate with all the stu dents? The
    list of job interviews I is in plain sight for any individ ual who cares to
    take the trouble to look it over. In addition to I listing the recruiters
    and dates, this master sheet describes the j type of people (A. B.,
    Business, Math, Physics, Engineering, etc.) in which the company is
    interest- j ed. Any * person scanning this list can immediately spot the pos
    sible openings which pertain to his general field of study. The next step is
    for the student to make an appointment with the Placement secretary for the
    inter view which he desires. There is absolutely no discrimination as to who
    is granted an interview--it is run strictly on a first come first ! served
    basis. Once the student gets an inter view it is certainly not any fault of
    the Placement Bureau if he does not get the job. The Place- I ment Bureau
    can bring the pros pective employee and prospective employer together, but
    it cannot I make job offers. If business and I natural science students get
    more j job offers, it is only because their !services are in greater demand.
    This is a fact which has been ob- jvious to all for sbme time now, and there
    is not a thing that the

Heading: DISCRIMINATION
Content: by George Diefenbach Discrimination! --The word has been shouted so long and
    loud of late that many are now willing to do anything just to stop its echo.
    Some feel that the word is a sacred cow and that to bring it to the lips of
    the masses can do no good. Others feel it suggests a band wagon fad which
    will soon pass; !still others are completely numb I to any effect the word
    may or j might hold to himself and his so- | ciety. ! Many of you remember
    "dis- I crimination" in connection with | much talk and many letters "sug- I
    gesting" that the admissions de- j partment strike from the admis- son form
    questions concerning race and religion. I have even heard comment that such
    an ac- 1 tioh would "automatically raise I the entire university above re- I
    proach on the discrimination is sue". There have been accusa tions towards
    group and individ uals alike with the pointed finger j again shouting
    "discrimination" ; and there have been suggestions that a statement of
    Bucknell's policy by someohe speaking for the administration could, again
    automatically, clear the entire campus of these accusations. Fin ally, there
    has been feeling that simply by bringing more Negro students to the
    university we can proudly declare that B. U. is free of prejudice. Let's,
    not be ridiculous. It's easy to see that the success of any or all of these
    movements is not in itself an ultimate goal. These are merely steps toward
    an end, and that end is the elim ination of prejudice and discrim ination in
    any of the subtle forms it may take. To expect a realiz ation of this end
    overnight is equally ridiculous, therefore we can work only toward these com
    ponent steps. This all is quite a large order and will necessarily take
    time, but it is necessary to recognize the end before one can believe in or
    appreciate the means toward that end. Let's understand, that the pur pose of
    these movements is, not to embarrass any individual or group of indiviiduals
    through "rigged" demonstrations. Like wise, they are not aimed at cor nering
    anyone for the purpose of individual revenge. The worth of removing the
    photograph and religion clause would show that Bucknell'is willing to act
    official ly in taking a step to remove doubt that it has any but the best
    intentions. A statement of policy in perhaps defining "Christian Tradition"
    would do even more. (Continued on Page 3)

    it pleases. It may choose whom it wishes to accept and whom it wishes not to

    an atmosphere which seems to hover over the campus, an atmosphere composed
    of a fear to act because logic and truth are overshadowed by ignorance of
    the facts; an atmosphere of innate prejudices-- again a fault of ig norance;
    an atmosphere of gen eral complacency which is a plague in itself. No one
    can plead complete innocence in any of these areas; but still we can act to
    try to erradicate this atmos phere and therefore discrimina tion itself. If
    each would make the effort to realize and try to correct his own attitude of
    prejudice, a big step would be taken toward re storing "Christian |
    Tradition" to its original definition. "What's the connection?", you may
    ask. How could the university define the phrase as applied to their ob
    jectives when they have no as surance that this definition would be enforced
    by the members of the Bucknell family? How can they state a ploicy of non-
    discrim ination knowing discrimination exists in the dorms and class rooms
    -- subtle discrimination? How can we even invite Negro students here where
    it is not cer tain that they will be accepted into the Ijiucknell social
    circle? The movements asking action from the administration must be
    accompanied by action- from the students and faculty. Declare how you feel!
    Know why you feel the way you do. Then act according to your beliefs. Let's
    get busy, I'm also tired of hearing this word "discrimination" .

Content: In a recent learned journal ( Mad) the distinguished board chairman (Ralph "
    Hot-Lips" Sigafoos) of one of our most important American corporations (the
    Arf Mechanical Dog Co.) wrote a trenchant article in which he pinpointed our
    gravest national problem: the lack of culture among science graduates. Mr.
    Sigafoos's article, it must be emphasized, was in no sense derogatory. He
    stated quite clearly that the science student, what with his gruelling
    curriculum in physics, math, and chem istry, can hardly be expected to find
    time to study the arts too. What Mr. Sigafoos deplores--indeed, what we all
    deplore --is the lopsided result of today's science courses: graduates who
    can build a bridge but can't compose a concerto, who know Planck's Constant
    but not Botticelli's Venus, who are familiar with Fraunhofer's lines but not
    with Schiller's. Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this hideous
    imbalance. I, however, believe there is one--and a very simple one. It is
    this: if students of science don't have time to come to the arts, then we
    must let the arts come to students of science.

Content: For example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry and music right along
    with physics. Students, instead of merely being called upon to recite in
    physics class, would instead be. required to rhyme their answers and set
    them to familiar tunes --like, for*instance, The Colonel Bogey March. Thus
    recitations would not only be chock-full of important facts but would, at
    the same time, expose the student to the aesthetic delights of great music.
    Here, try it yourself. You all know The Colonel Bogey March. Come, sing
    along with me: Physics # Is what we learn in class. Einstein Said energy is
    mass. Newton Is highfalutin And Pascal's a rascal. Sa's Boyle. Do you see
    how much more broadening, how much more uplifting to learn physics this way?
    Of course you do. What? You want another chorus? By all means: Leyden He
    made the Leyden jar. Trolley lie made the Trolley car. Curie. it ode in a
    surrey, And Diesel's a weasel. So's Boyle. Once the student ljas mastered
    The Colonel Bogey March, he can go on to more complicated melodies like
    Death and Trans figuration, the Eroica, and Love Me Tender. And when the
    student, loaded with science and culture, leaves the classroom and lights
    his Marlboro, how much more he will enjoy that filter, that flavor, that
    pack or box! Because there will no longer be an unease gnawing at his soul,
    no longer a little voice within him repeating that he is culturally a dolt.
    He will know --know joyously --that he is a fulfilled man, a whole man, and
    he will bask and revel in the pleasure of his Marlboro as a colt rolls in
    new grass--content, complete, truly educated--a credit to his college, to
    himself, and to his tobac conist! (c) 1961 Mas Sbuimaa And while he is
    rolling, colt-wise, in the new grass, perhaps he would stop long enough to
    try a new cigarette from the makers o f Marlboro -- unfiltered, king-size

    job on Larry Siegfried, while Jack Egan and John Havlicek should provide
    some real excitement. Don;t discount the Hawks. Bison All-Opponent Team One
    of the All-Teams that receives little recognition is each school's All-
    Opponent squad. The Bisons, despite a 12-11 record, played a very good
    schedule this year and faced some of the top ball players in the country.
    From a slate that included Cornell, LaSalle. Pitt, Temple (N IT entry), St.
    Joe's, Westminster, George Wash ington, Colgate, and Penn State, the Bison
    squad, selected: Ron Warner--Gettysburg Jack Egan-- St. Joseph's Gene
    Harris-- Penn State Ron Galbriath--Westminster Bob McAlteer-- LaSalle as the
    1960-61 all-opponent five. , Among those considered were Russ Gordon and
    Bruce Drysdale of Temple, Bob Duffy of Colgate, Norm Brandi of Lehigh, Jon
    Feld man of GW, and John Fridley of Pitt. by Ted Odenwald The first annual
    faculty-intra mural all-star game turned into a fun-filled 32-minute fiasco
    Tues day as the faculty " won" a 51-50 decision. Going into the final
    quarter, the intramural squad led 44-29, but with the assistance of referee
    Mike Fadden and Dick Kniffen the faculty was able to score a tense come-
    from-behind vctory. I Assistant Dean of Men, Jerry Griffis was the game's
    high scor er, dumping in 23 points. "Griff" was aided mainly by Skip Weider
    who did a fine job in the forward position. The intramural team's scoring
    was evenly distributed. Ken Twiford and Bill Emory each scored eight points,
    leading the team. Don Olson, Paul Terhes, j and Doug Reed each scored six.
    The first three quarters were completely dominated by the in -' tramural
    squad except at certain points when Griffis, Weider, and Straiano sunk back-
    to-back bas- j kets for the faculty administration i five. 'Large' Squad A t
    the beginning of the final j stanza, faculty coach Spike Jan- nides called
    for a conference with the referees. After a brief con versation, the game
    was resumed. Obviously unknown to the ref erees, the faculty now had a seven
    man squad in action. With the added help,, the faculty was able to tighten
    up its defenses and prevent the younger team from scoring while they cut
    into the student's lead. Griff Scores 1 With only bne second remaining in
    the game, the faculty* trailing 1 by two points, 50-48, called for a time
    out. As the ball was put into play it was noticed that the clock was not
    running. The final I one second of the game lasted about a minute and a half
    and in te closing play of the game, Grif- I fis sunk a layup with his back
    to | the basket, and with two oppon- I ents hanging from his arms. The |
    buzzer sounded, eding the game, !but Griffis still had a foul shot ! coming
    to him. The crowd sat in silent apprehension as "Griff" 1 stepped to the
    foul line. The si- ! lence was broken by Coach Jan- nides' cry, " Come on
    Jerry! Griffis' foul shot swished through the net giving the faculty a vic
    tory. Coach Jannides commented af ter the game, "They were^ trying to give
    the game away to us, but we didn't want to take it." Faculty -

Heading: Mike's View
Content: by Mike Ingraham During the last four years, four musicals have been attempted
    by the University Players: Guys and Dolls. Kiss Me Kate, The Pajama Game,
    and Pal Joey. Although there has been a steady decline in their quality, the
    performances have varied. By far the best written and scored, Guys and Dolls
    exhibited extraordinary singing and dancing talent by, alas, long gone
    Bucknellians. In this production, even the noxious influence of the
    orchestra was held to a minimum. Kiss Me Kate, on the other hand, found it
    rougher going and nearly suc cumbed to the clamor in the pit but for the
    powerful voices of the two leads. The less said about Pajama Game the
    better; its va pidness defies description. Now Pal Joey is quite a unique
    case. It seems that those mys terious people behind every musi cal
    production have finally real ized that you can't join an undis ciplined
    voice with an unruly Or chestra and get anything but noise. It's a simple
    matter of logistics; you don't pass ammuni tion to the enemy. Evidently the
    staff of Pal Joey took a good look and a long listen to their leads, became
    panicky, and immediately sent for Dorothy Wilson.

Content: woman of unquestionable talent, Miss Wilson scored the music for two pianos,
    thereby removing a major obstacle in the path of a respectable performance.
    The next difficulty to be over come was casting, and here the attempt was
    only partially suc cessful. It was curious to notice that for the identical
    reasons Susan Aymar failed last year in Pajama Game, she succeeded in Pal
    Joey. Her shy manner and small voice perfectly suited the part of Linda.
    Unfortunately the reverse was true of Linda Garrett. While she might have
    .looked and acted the part of the vamp, the impression immediate ly
    disintegrated when she sang. Nobody could have looked more like a Joey than
    Jeffrey Gaynor. Tall, slim, and dapper, Mr. Gay nor counteracted the effect
    of his quaking voice with sure and easy gestures, and when not upstaging hs
    fellow actors, he was vexing the audience into envious disap- I proval of
    Joey's exploits. As inevitably happens in these musicals, the secondary
    charact ers stole the show. Judy Levy as Gladys combined the grace of a
    ballerina and the vitality of a Cossack with a rich and vibrant voice to
    assure her place as fore most in the memories of the audi-

    Damon Runyon flavor together with Beth Worthington as Melba. Stuart Sharp,
    as the lecherous tenor, Louis, contributed the only real voice heard all eve
    ning. The tailor, Ernest, was portrayed by Landis Coffman, the | most
    talented stage comedian seen here for four years. Mr. Coffman did remarkably
    well in Amphylrion 38, although a little out of his element and will un
    doubtedly reward us with a part in the forthcoming Male Animal. The
    choreography was well I abbve average this year and help ed to bolster its
    somewhat falter ing vocal counterpart although some numbers seemed a bit su-
    i perfluous. Taking everything into consid- | eration, however, it seems
    that for a thoroughly superficial and terribly written musical comedy, Pal
    Joey found a pleasant med ium with which to interpret its better moments and
    a full house with which to greet them. * * * #

    Joey takes place, and indeed, from the view we got from the newly opened
    "Chez Joey," it must be a wonderful place. The first person to give us that
    impression is night-club owner Joe LoGrippo, the tough, wise-1 cracking
    proprietor of "Mike's j Place," where Pal Joey gets his I | start. Then Joey
    himself makes I I the scene, in the form of Jeff ! Gaynor. Now admittedly

    won't even ask to be an MC . . . Gay Pulley was her usual inimitable self as
    the night club's strip ar tist (I think), and Landis Coffman was very funny
    as Ernest, the tailor, although (now maybe I'm sensitive) I think a little
    bit of the Semitic stuff goes a long way. "Zip" Columnist Melba, played by
    Beth Worth ington, was the best columi\ist since Kupincett started writing
    in Chi, and was funnier than hell, to 'boot. Her number "Zip" was enjoyed by
    everybody, and say, where can you get St. James Scotch, anyway? Ludlow
    Lowell, played by Mel Goldstein, was hys terical for awhile and pretty funny
    even later on. (I stress the word funny in this review, I notice, but a
    musical comedy is supposed to be funny). fact that the orchestras have been
    so heavily criticized in the past. Instead there was a two piano and drum
    accompaniment (if there was something else forgive me-- I was too enthralled
    by what was going, on on stage to notice it) which was quite adequate for a
    [show of this kind and left lots of room for the singers for a pleas ant
    change. We're all for this two i piano and drum bit in future musicals, for
    it's a lot easier, cheaper, and more effective in the long run, although
    some people may miss the thump-thujnp of I previous orchestras. In summary,
    let's just say, as I Gladys does in the first act, that the whole show was
    lots of "funs- I ville" and we recommend that all | of you who missed it on
    opening I night (when this review is being written) get to see it as soon as
    ,you can.

Content: As far as the rest of the cast was concerned, the dancing was very good and the
    bit parts func tioned very well. Judy Levy was again the best dancer, but
    every body did very nicely and added to the sum total of a very good show.
    The lighting was fine, make-up was satisfactory, but the sets left much to
    be desired--they just weren't anything at all. Costumes were perfect and the
    direction of the show--kudoesto Mike Gavin --left very little to be desired.
    No Orchestra In case you didn't notice, there was no orchestra in this
    produc tion, and this may be due to the by Joel Flegler Two of the recent
    elaborate Hollywood productions have made ! me question the often heard pro-
    I pagar.da line of our film makers j that "movies are better than ever." At
    least I'd hate to have to defend that point after having seen Butterfield 8
    and Where the Boys Are. First, let's look at what happen- | ed to Elizabeth
    Tayor in her lat- | est venture. Miss Taylor does seem to get into some
    pretty in teresting sexual relationships in her roles, and this film is no
    ex ception. Her unfortunate and un believable ending in a blazing car
    accident once again proves that women who mess around with other wives'
    husbands may end up in quite a mess themselves. As if this were not enough
    to ruin the movie, someone thought up the idea of casting Eddie Fiah- ler
    alongside his wife, which did prove one thing--that he could act twice as
    badly with his second wife as he could with his first. It ! is also sad for

    executive jobs are on the ground. Of course, all officers may apply for

    There will always be a need for piloted aircraft. And it is foreseeable that
    in your working lifetime, there will be piloted spacecraft--piloted and
    navigated by Air Force officers. But right now, there is also a big future
    for college- trained Air Force officers on the ground. New and exciting
    technical jobs are opening up. Important ad ministrative positions must be
    filled as World War II officers move into retirement. How can you--a college
    student--become an Air Force officer? First, there's Air Force ROTC. Then
    for college graduates, men and women in certain fields, there is Officer
    Training School. The graduate of its three-month course wins a commission as
    a sec ond lieutenant. Other ways are the Navigator Train ing program, and
    the Air Force Academy. Some benefits that go with being an Air Force
    officer. Starting salary plus allowances compare with the average in
    equivalent civilian jobs. Then there's free medical and dental care, thirty-
    day vaca tion, the chance to win graduate degrees at Air Force expense, and
    liberal retirement provisions. No, Air Force officers do not. need wings to
    move up. There's plenty doing on the ground. Perhaps you could be one of
    these young executives in blue. Ask your local Air Force Recruiter. Or
    write. Officer Career Information, Dept. SC13, Box 7608,' Washington 4,
    D.C., if you want further infor mation about the navigator training or

Heading: Reveals Solution
Content: by Patty Brown What kind of transportation will there be in the near future? Our
    roads are too crowded, even our air is getting too full. Ford Foundation
    thinks they have an answer to the arising problem-- the Levaear, a car which
    glides on a thin film of air. Cars are traveling increasingly, faster. As
    they approach the j speeds of 150 mph. Ford forsees such needs as better
    control than mere human reflexes, smoother; highways, bigger power plants in
    side cars, and something other than wheels. The Levaear is an answer to all
    these needs. The automatically controlled "car" would levatate Vi of an inch
    above 4 to 6 inches wide steel tracks. The first small model levaear was
    built on the principle of leva- tation and propulsion, possessing nozzles
    that thrust down and backwards at the same time. This j arrangement was not
    suited for high speeds so the levapad, a cir- [cular disk with many pin
    point air jets was installed for leva- tation and a rear fan for propul
    sion. The first passenger Levaear was the Mark I having a lVa horsepower
    motor and a 7-pound thrust. From the front, the one- passenger futuristic
    car resembles a glass-top dishwasher. The next step was to seat four
    passengers from front to back. The model that accomplished this was a
    streamlined vehicle which looked like a small jet plane, and theo- ritically
    could attain speeds of 500 mph! Ford realized that there would ; always be a
    need for the family | car and so decided to concentrate on the Levaear for
    public trans portation. They were challenged j with the task of seating 400
    per sons in a cigar shaped vehicle narrow enough to fit into the tubes of
    Grand Central Station \ yet short enough to go around | corners. By using
    three sections ! (much like three railroad cars) and placing a huge fan at
    either end, the designers came up with a double deck Levaear that seated
    passengers as comfortably as do major airlines, and which would make
    passible trips from Detroit to Chicago in one hour; New York to Philadelphia
    in Vi hour. Many questions immediately present themselves. How does it slop?
    It slides to a stop using "brake shoes". A nice comfortable stop from 200
    mph can be accomplish ed in this manner in about three miles. By using the
    "brake shoes" and reverse thrust of the fans, an emergency stop can be accom
    plished in a little less than a mile. Since it obviously can not "stop on a
    dime" what happens if ; the track is out of order? A small safety vehicle
    would j travel several miles in front of ! the Levaear and send back sig- !
    nals. If you don't receive a sig- I nal, stop! If the Levaear floats only V*
    of ; an inch from the track, what 1 about ice and snow? Electric wires

    suspected because he, too, is in love with Claudia. Mrs. Fiske Warren,
    Claudia's real mother, is another suspect because She very heartily
    disapproves of Jack. As it turns out, Claudia and half of the town have good
    reasons for disposing of Jack Ellery. The the past year, evidence points
    strongly toward Mrs. Warren, but further investi gation proves that Jack was
    not shot, but had been poisoned. Of course there is a solution to this

    Strengthening the student gov -1 emment was a major effort of the Congress.
    Through a revision of 1 the SFC constitution, many un necessary, time
    consuming pro- ] cedures were eliminated. In a move toward more unified
    student, government, an SFC committee is working on government reorgani
    zation proposals. A plan favor ing a student government pattern ed after the
    Federal government and divided into three separate branches is now under
    consider ation. The Academic Advisory Coun cil was established to consider
    the academic standards and programs of Bucknell and to offer suggest ions
    for improvement. This com mittee will advise both the Dean of the University
    and the SFC. Two other committees were oc cupied with problems involving
    academic life. Headed by vice president, Carl Hudson, the com mittee on
    faculty evaluation has worked at revising the evaluation form used last
    year. The possi bility of a uniform cut system was explored by another
    commit tee, headed by. Allen Macomber. Financial requests of campus
    organizations were heard by the Budget Committee, which appro- pfriated
    approximately $50,000 for the fiscal year July 1, 1961--June Special aid was
    granted to WVBU, the Bucknell Rifle Team, and L'Agenda. Tentative
    recognition for one year was granted to the Sky Div ing Club at Bucknell and
    the Bucknell Ski Club. A new set of freshman hazing rules, accept able to
    both students and faculty, were also adopted. The report closed with a list

    According to an old Colgate tradition, 13 is a lucky num ber. Last Friday

    Dear Editor: It has come to my attention gress, in its usual discreet and un
    assuming manner, has deemed it advisable and necessary to banish (Continued
    on page 4) I bring up the population explosion not to alarm you, for I feel
    certain that science will ultimately solve the problem. After all, lias not
    science in recent years brought us such marvels as the transistor, the
    computer, the bevatron, and the Marlboro filter? Oh, what a saga of science
    was the discovery of the Marlboro filter! Oh, what a heart-rending epic of
    endless trial and error, of dedication and perseverance! And, in the end,
    what a triumph it was when the Marlboro scientists after years of testing
    and discarding one filter material after another--iron, nickel, lead, tin,
    antimony, sponge cake--finally emerged, tired but happy, from their
    laboratory, carrying in their hands the perfect filter cigarette! What
    rejoicing there was that day! Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever
    we light a Marlboro and settle back and enjoy that full-flavored smoke which
    comes to us in soft pack or flip-top box at tobacco counters in all fifty
    states and Cleveland! Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems rising
    out of the population explosion, but in the meantime the problems hang heavy
    over America's colleges. This year will bring history's greatest rush of
    high school graduates. Where will we find class rooms and teachers for this
    gigantic new influx? Well sir, some say the answer is to adopt the trimester
    system. This system, now in use at many colleges, eliminates summer
    vacations, has three semesters per annum instead of two, and compresses a
    four year course into three years. This is good, but is it good enough? Even
    under the trimester system the student has occasional days off. Moreover his
    nights are utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind of all-out attack
    that is indicated? I say no. I say desperate problems call for desperate
    reme dies. I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I say we
    must do no less than go to school every single day of the year.. But that is
    not all. I say we must go to school #4 hours of every day! The benefits o f
    such a program are, of course, obvious. First of all, the classroom shortage
    will immediately disappear be cause all the dormitories can be converted
    into classrooms. Second, the teacher shortage will immediately disappear
    because all the night watchmen can be put to work teaching calculus and
    Middle English poetry. And finally, overcrowding will immediately disappear
    because everyone will quit school. Any further questions? (c) 1961 M mc
    HRultnaw Yes, one further Question: Have you tried Marlboro's newest partner
    in pleasure-- the unaltered, king-site Philip Morris Commander? If not, by
    all means com e aboard. You'll be glad you did.

    telephones throughout the U. S. The average call over today's
    electromechanical system requires 420 relay operations. All together, this
    intercon necting equipment makes up the heart of what is, in effect, the
    world's largest machine. That's where Western Electric and you come in. The
    switching equipment for this "machine" involves an enormous manufactur ing
    job carried on by our plants throughout the country. Because of the size and
    service requirements involved, we require quality standards far exceeding
    those of ordinary manufacturing. The size of this job presents an unusual
    challenge to the engineer who may save the Bell System many thousands of
    dollars by even a small cost-reduction step. While today s switching calls
    for a priority on engineering, tomorrow's will be even more exciting. For
    even now the revolutionary Elec tronic Central Office is under field trial

    immutable. Only On Wed., March 15, the IFC passed a resolution to restrict
    hazing activities within the fra ternities on the Bucknell campus. The
    resolution, presented in the form of a suggestion, was brought before the
    floor by George Coo- gan, chairman of the Resolutions Committee. Following
    is a com plete statement of the resolution. Moved that the IFC adopt and
    publish the following recommend ations ; Hazing activities should be of such
    nature that they do not interfere with the pledge's academic pursuits. 1.
    Hazinfi activities shall be confined to the inside of the Chapter house. 2.
    Help Week shall be held when classes are not in ses sion. 3. In keeping with
    the in terests of the fraternities and the safety of their members, "rides"
    are to be discouraged. The IFC hopes that these rec ommendations will
    successfully convey the attitude that academ ics are of primary importance
    in university life arid that the fra ternities themselves cannot op pose
    this ideal. tive of SFC if they are really rep resenting the wishes of the

Heading: Doves Nest Abroad
Content: In a recent speech, President Kennedy appealed to Americans to "ask not what
    your country will do for you, but rather what you can do for your country."
    As re sponse to this request, he received an energetic approval of his Peace
    Corps program. In spite of all the fervor raised by Americans, many people
    have little information on what the Peace Corps actually is. Officially the
    Corps is a "pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.
    S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help
    foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled man power."
    Unofficially, it is a new adventure designed to win friends for the U. S. by
    approaching foreigners on a personal, non-political basis, thus thwarting
    present cold- war techniques. Men and women, at least 18 years old, are
    eligible to volunteer for the Peace Corps. Applicants need not be ' college
    graduates, but should be people with trade skills or some special job
    experience. Before they are selected, applicants will bethoroughly
    interviewed, tested and re tested, and specifically trained to serve in a
    particular area and in a particular capacity. Members of the Peace Corps
    will not have an easy job. This statement needs emphasis. Volunteers may
    find their work tedious and full of frustration. Their living condi tions
    will probably be poor. They will have to learn to cope with the deep
    distrust of the uninformed. Members of the Peace Corps will receive no
    salary--only an allow ance which is sufficient to meet their basic needs and
    to maintain their health. Furthermore, service with the Corps will not
    exempt volunteers from Selective Service. Despite any of the inherent
    drawbacks of the Peace Corps, its potential worth seems to far outmeasure
    any harm which may result. We have an "exciting genera tion" of Americans
    who are willing and capable to aid their country and world. It seems only
    fair to-give these people the training and opportunity to play their full
    part in the world community. Because of the facilities available at Bucknell
    and the large number of foreign students enrolled, this University has
    applied to become a training center for Peace Corps volunteers. To foster
    interest and support in the Corps, a conference is being planned by the
    Christian Associa tion. By adequately informing and educating the students
    here, it is hoped that Bucknellians will take an affirmative stand regarding
    this newest peace venture. somehow i have a rather ' uneasy feeling that

    supervisor of the Book Siore began to re- gard the inhabitants of this
    institution in a more equitable manner. In addition, it is interesting to
    note the speed with which book orders are being fulfilled. Many students did
    not receive texts for their courses as late as mid-semester. What a
    wonderful state of affairs; and how conducive it is to furthering our
    academic poten tialities! In the first place, why should the store have to
    order extra books for a course? It should always be prepared to equip
    students who have transferred into a class at the last minute. You may argue
    feat the Book Store might be overladen with extra volumes in certain courses
    if they were to order a shipment of books in excess of their demand. As far
    as we are concerned, it is better to stock a few extra books than to create
    a situation in which students would tend to fall behind in their work
    because they lack adequate texts. Also, un used books can be returned to the
    publisher for a refund. How many of you have inquired about desired texts
    and have been told that they could not be sold because they were in the base
    ment of the Book Store and had not yet been price-marked? The clerks at the
    store courteously tell you to please try again in three days or in a week
    because they are so busy that it would be impos sible for them to put a
    price tag on the book you want before that time. Would it not be feasible to
    use some of the profit made by the store in order to hire someone who would
    make sure that books are available when they are requested? In many
    respects, it seems almost as if the Book Store is thwart ing us. It's

    many good ones we could come up with if we worked together! We might start
    by drafting a letter to Con gress, from all of us (perhaps en dorsed by SFC,
    and maybe even the entire Bucknell faculty). No, one letter might not hit

    the matter before the Senate of WSGA on Wednesday, April 19, as a kind of
    jumping-off point. All I ask you to do is give a little support --a note in
    the mailbox, a word in passing, a letter to the Buck nellian. Just let me
    know that, as part of the American Public, you want to do something. That's
    all. You see, Bucknellian, I agree . . . one ant can't move even a pebble.
    But 2400 can start a landslide. Hopefully, Joan Fetter Box W27 of students
    leave on Friday. One way of preventing students from leaving early is to
    schedule tests on Saturday; the professor has a legitimate right to do this,
    be cause the school does not close officially until Saturday noon. However,
    few students can con centrate on their studies the night before because they
    see their friends leaving, they pack their own suitcases, and they are ex
    cited about starting a vacation. Since Friday night social events and
    Saturday morning classes are incompatible, one or the other should be
    abolished. Since the primary purpose of the university ' is to further the
    development of intellect, the true student would immediately advocate the
    abolition of Friday night social events. However, this is not so easily
    done. It would include the closing of all fraternity houses on Friday
    nights, no.more sched uling of baskeball games on Fri day nights, no more
    college dances, plays, etc. This policy might lead to a great piling up of
    social events on Saturday night, and no event would be well supported i The
    abolition of Friday night social events does not seem prac tical or
    realistic; it seems to be going against human nature, for man is a very
    social animal Furthermore, even if the Univer sity formally abolished social
    events, students could still go bowling, go to the movies, dance at the
    Sweet Shop, chat at the Bison, or drive to nearby towns for informal
    communication and socializing. There is little content to the argument that
    the students need Friday evening social events in order to provide for a
    "well- rounded education" and to learn "to get along with other people."
    Such needs are well provided for by dormitory life, conversations to and
    between classes, dinner table chats, and, of course, social events,
    scheduled at times which are less likely to hamper educa tional aspirations.
    It can, also, be said that once Saturday morning classes are abolished, then
    students will start their jubliations a day earlier, on Thursday night. Even
    now there are social events, both scheduled and unscheduled, on weekday
    nights. The trend will only con tinue if concessions in the aca demic
    schedule are made to extra curricular activities. Although the lack of
    attendace in Saturday morning classes is the most obvi ous result of Friday
    evening so cial events, every course suffers to some extent in proportion to
    the amount of socializing which is done. The loss of study-time in
    consequence tp Friday night social events can effect one course as well as
    another. If the schedule were changed, and Saturday morning classes were
    integrated into a five day class schedule, the resultant plan would
    jeopardize .the effective ness of fee courses by causing un due cramming.

Heading: ' Vital Question9
Content: by James Reiser Many recurring problems plague the students of Bucknell Univer
    sity. Some of these issues are semiannual in nature, that is, they bloom
    twice a year--once at the first semester registration, and again at the
    second semester or deal. It is one such problem which I wish to discuss now.
    Psychologists tell us that most people love to harbor secrets. It gives them
    a feeling of uniqueness I and sets them apart from their unknowing
    neighbors. This fact appears to be especially true of Bucknell' English
    department. Why that mysterious'group loves occultism so much that they
    don't even divulge the names of the professors who are teaching par ticular
    English courses--namely, the rehabilitating English 101-102 and that
    disseminator of literary j wsdom--world literature. Not being one to shirk
    the re- sponsibilities of a good detective, | I investigated this situation.
    By I hiding in the closet in the room | of the department secretary and j by
    disguising myself as a book- i shelf in the department's confer ence room, I
    overheard some re- | vealing conversations. In addition to learning that In-
    j structor Dillard was dating young I male students and that Associate i
    Professor (space) had never pass- j ed his spelling test, I heard Chair- j
    man Johnson utter the following: j "Ladies and gentlemen, oh! and j you
    too," as he nodded to an odd looking creature sitting in the i corner of the
    room, "I have called I this special meeting in order to | make up stories so
    that we can deey the attack which the Buck- j nellian Is going to launch on
    us j next week." Altough I was stun ned to learn that there was a traitor on
    our newspaper staff, I listened as the Chairman con-1 tinued. "We must think

    investigating the student loan plan. If you are one who is considering the
    "Learn Now, Pay Later" system,you would do well first to study the case of
    Leonid Sigafoos. Leonid, the son of an upholsterer in Straitened Circum
    stances, Idaho, had his heart set on going to college, but his father; alas,
    could not afford to send him. Leonid applied for a Regents Scholarship, but
    his reading'speed, alas, was .not very rapid--two words an hour--and before
    he could finish the first page of his test the Regents had closed their
    brief cases crossly and gone home. Leonid then applied for an athletic
    scholarship, but he had, alas, only a single athletic skill balancing a
    stick on his chin--and this, alas, aroused only passing enthusiasm among the
    coaches. it becavlse we must save face; af ter all this is a democratic coun

    plausible. From now on, please limit your comments to those of an opposite
    nature or I'll make you stand in the comer for being | naughty." So the
    meeting continued for 45 minutes while the committee worked on a resolution
    which "answered" the Bucknellian s query. Finally the Chairman rose again.
    "We must," he stated, "take an important vote on the issue confronting us."
    He paused momentarily, then continued. "Should members of our depart- ben be

    learned of the student loan plan, he could borrow money for his tuition and
    repay it in easy monthly installments after he left school! Happily Leonid
    enrolled in the Southeastern Idaho College of Woodpulp and Restoration Drama
    and happily began a college career that grew more happy year by year.
    Indeed, it became altogether ecstatic in his senior year because Leonid met
    a coed named Salina T. Nem with hair like beaten gold and eyes like two
    squirts of Lake Louise. Love gripped them m its big moist palm and they were
    betrothed on the Eve of fet. Agnes. Happily they made plans to be married
    the day after com mencement-plans, alas, that never were to come to fruition
    because Leonid, alas, learned that Salina, like himself, was m college on a
    student loan, which meant that he had not only to repav his own loan when he
    left school but also Salma s, and the job, alas, that was waiting for Leonid
    after graduation at the Boise Raccoon Works simply did not pay enough, alas,
    to cover both their loans, plus rent and food and clothing- Sick at heart,
    Leonid and Salina sat down and lit Marlboro Cigarettes and tried to find an
    answer to their problem-and, sure enough, they did! I do not know whether or
    not Marlboro Cigarettes helped them find an answer; all I know' is that
    Marlboros taste good and look good, and when things close in and a feller
    needs a friend and the world is black as the pit from pole to pole, it is a
    heap of comfort and satisfaction to be sure that Marlboros will always
    provide the same unflagging pleas ure, the same unstinting quality, in all
    times and climes and conditions. That's all I know. ' Leonid and Salina, I
    say, did find an answer--a very simple one If their student loans did not
    come due until they let* school, why, then they just wouldn't leave school!
    So after receiving their bachelor degrees, they re-enrolled and took masters
    degrees. After that they took doctors degrees, loads and loads of them,
    until today Leonid and Salina, both aged 78, bofe still in school, hold
    doctorates in Philosophy, Humame Letters, Jurisprudence, Veterinary
    Medicine, Civil Engineering, Op tometry, and Dewey Decimals. Their student
    loans, as of last January 1, amounted to a' combined total of eighteen
    million dollars, a sum which they probably would have found great difficulty
    in repaying had not the Department of the Interior recently declared them a
    National Park. * <g) 1961 Max ShuJjn** You don't need a student loanr-just a
    little loose change-- to grab yourself a new kind of smoking pleasure from
    the makers o f Marlboro--the unaltered king-size Philip Morris Commander.

Heading: College Basketball Blasted by Syndicated Columnist
Content: 

Heading: !*(tm)**15
Content: Editor's Note-- This aricle ap-] peared as part of a syndicated i column. While
    it is true that basketball season is over, there | remains in the aftermath
    a stig ma, tarnishing a wonderful com petitive year. While Mr. Can non's
    observations were created with conviction and forcefulneess they are too
    general in their ac cusation* Some of his comments, however, bear a very
    appalling amount of truth and should not bebe passed off lightly. Mr. Can
    non has not taken a very agree able tack, but certainly an inter esting one.
    by Jimmy Cannon Reprinted from the Hearst Newspapers Basketball is the slot
    machine of sports. Crooked gamblers again regulate the scoring of col lege
    games as if they were me chanics using screw drivers and wrenches to control
    the playoffs. But they are working with kids instead of machinery. They are
    tampering with the hearts and minds of boys, not nuts and bolts. The
    corruption of the innocent is one o f the most evil crimes man commits
    against his own species. It is a form of murder,! because the fixers are
    assassins of ideals. Many of the universities are accomplices. They must
    share the burden of guilt because they are accessories before the fact. Some
    institutions unmentioned in the present investigation are as much involved
    as those whose immature athletes collaborated with the gamblers. The college
    basketball is a rotten pumpkin. The ethics of a lot of schools would
    embarrass a shylock. It is as if, instead of functioning as shrines of
    enlightment, they are i mobs competing for the control of the underworld
    that college bas ketball has become. Universities "Buy" Loyalty Originally,
    before the fixers come, some universities buy the loyalty of their players.
    The satchel men merely offered big ger bribes. The kids are taught that even
    honor has a price. Ath letic directors educate them to believe that they
    should go where they can make the best deal. Never a season goes by that a
    college isn't exposed as surrepti tiously offering propositions to steal
    kids from other universities. Hardly a year passes without one being fined
    or suspended for giv ing boys clandestine benefits. The kids wear the names
    of their college on their jerseys, but the money from the hustlers is in the
    pockets of their street pants hanging in the lockers. The j common color of
    the college bas-, ketball player is dollar green. The I basic reason for
    this scandal is i the bagmen offer more lucrative | rewards than the
    colleges. The kids are disgraced, just as those who shaved points in 1951 |
    were. The gamblers w ill go to jail where they belong. The coaches and
    athletic directors w ill insist they were betrayed by the j | greed of the
    tall adolescents they j instruct. The promoters, who ar-1 | range the
    schedules for public] j buildings, w ill express indigna tion because their
    profits will I diminish as attendance withers. The educators w ill grieve
    about | the lost pride of the young. The | college presidents will form com-
    I mittees to search through the j debris of ruined lives. The game I w ill
    retreat temporarily to the campus gyms, which it should j never leave. But
    the vile system I of recruiting and bribery w ill be j established as
    rapidly as the razed ] structure scan again be erected. It could never occur
    again, the educators promised, after the kids pulled jail time in '51. But
    it has happened, exactly as it did before. The last time, the New York
    Journal-American turned it up. The New York City D A's office busted this
    one. What kind of a sport is it when a coach can't de tect his team is
    throwing a game? Why do they always wait for the cops to come? It appears
    that once every 10 years they must ! finish the schedule in the police |
    stations. Obviuosly, the college can't police their game. It is clear now
    that basketball must be super-

    by the umpire, the Bison baseballers were nosed out by a visiting Lehigh
    contingent 4-3 last Saturday. Bart Richards opened the last of the ninth
    with Bucknell trail ing 4-3 by beating out a bunt single. Ben Jones promptly
    laid down another bunt and seemed to Sports Illustrated prides itself on its
    complete coverage on the world of athletics and in a recent issue devoted to
    the national pas time went so far as to describe certain eccentricities of
    each Major League baseball park. These small paragraphs produced some of the
    QOWIl auuurel uvull ,, funniest bits of oddball information available. The
    following lines have it -Deat out for a single as are excerpts from the
    paragraphs describing "The Ball Park." N A TIO N A L LEAGUE Forbes Field
    (Pirates)--Posts obstruct view from some seats, es pecially along right
    field line. Ushers are capable, expect tips. No ads on outfield walls.
    Special problem: pigeons that park on girders under the roof. , County
    Stadium (Braves)--Best grandstand eating in baseball: bratmurst, hot corned
    beef, cheeseburgers, two kinds of hot dogs grilled cheese sandwiches,
    combination sandwiches (cheese, cold cuts, lettuce, salad dressing). Plus
    that fine beer. Busch Stadum (Cardinals)--Only park with draft beer (Boss
    Busch's and others). Longest dugouts in baseball, plush loge boxes ($2,750 a
    season) with elevator service, waiters, plugs for phone, radio,
    refrigerator. Lehigh's pitcher appeared to kick the ball into foul
    territory. The umpire saw it differently how ever, and called it a foul
    ball. Jones then sacrificed Richards to second. With only one out Rich ards
    rode to third as Gary Heck was safe on a fielder's choice. With the tying
    and winning runs on bake, the last two Bucknell batters struck out to end
    the game. Bisons Score In Sixth The Bisosn, who were held hit- Coliseum
    (Dodgers)-Capacity 92,000. Field change: right cen- less for six innings,
    first emerged No change: close, close Chinese ter moved in from 394 to 380
    feet. --  - - W all in left (251 feet). Candlestick Park (Giants)--Main
    problem unsolved: the wind. First baseman W illie McCovey complained: "Wind
    keeps blowing the peanut shells in my eyes." Ushers are girls, smartly
    uniformed, effi cient, don't expect tips. If things get out of hand, Burns
    detectives are on call. _  . , . . , Crosley Field (Redlegs)-- Smallest
    park. Refreshments include bratwurst, mettwurst, fried shrimp, and 16-ounce
    lemonade (Cincin nati leads the league in lemonade sales). W rigley Field
    (Cubs)--No night baseball. Ivy on outfield walls once thought poison by Cub
    outfielder Lou Novikoff. tendance: undershirt crowd on top floors of
    neigboring four-story apartment buildings. . . . , _ Connie Mack Stadium
    (Phillies)-- Specialty of the house "Hoagie,"-- 50c, fans bring beer into
    the ball park. Philadelphia boo-birds (worst in the league, according to the
    players) use pop com containers turned megaphones freely on rabbit-eared
    outfielders. AM ERICAN LEAGUE Yankee Stadium-- "The House that Ruth built."
    Ushers and vendors are noisiest, most aggressive in the majors (Just try and
    get away without tipping a stadium usher!). Stadium club serves din ner
    drinks before game to season ticket holders. j ' Municipal Stadium
    (Cleveland)--Three piece band provides live music at all games. Pleasant
    pre-game dinner parties (Held in out field in grassy space between fence and
    bleachers) for companies and fraternal groups. ___ Memorial Stadium
    (Baltimore)--Fans take it easy going up steep "Cardiac" ramps, though the
    climb is worth it: view  of the game and city from the heights is novel and
    interesting. No beer sold at seats, so lines at beer counters get awfully
    long. , << Comiskey Park (Chicago)--Picnic area under left-field stands.
    Famous landmark: Bill Veeck's spectacular firework shooting score- ^ ^ T ig
    e r  Stadium (Detroit)-- Ushers rarely growl when not tipped. Beer sold.
    Fireworks after some night games. Five-man combo frequently wanders through
    stands playing requests. Municipal Stadium-- (Athletics)--Home bullpen now
    in right in- stead of distant center, which eliminates need for car that
    used to transport pitchers from bullpen to mound. W rigley Field

    less seats than the Coliseum. Griffith Stadium (Senators)-- Left-field

    led off with a screaming double down the left field line. Bart Richards was
    sent up as a pinch-hitter and doubled to left center scoring Ditka. Then
    with two gone, Richards counter ed the second run of the inning on Gary
    Heck's single to right field. The Bisons' final run came in the eighth
    inning. Sam Neisner opened the frame with a single and was forced at second
    on M ik e! Kasnick's fielder's choice ground er. Ditka then unloaded a
    triple to deep left field to score Kasnick. Bob Sunenblick walked in the
    second, Sam Neisner was hit by a pitch in the third, and Ditka was likewise
    hit by a stray toss in the fourth and stole second. All three runners were
    left stranded. Lochten Sharp In Relief The visitors scored their first run
    in the fourth inning on a pair of singles and a long double. They added
    their final three tal lies in the seventh on a single, a fielder's choice in
    which all run ners were safe, a double, and a j three base throwing error by
    the starting and losing pitcher Dick Kiehn. Norm Lochten pitched the last
    two stanzas for Bucknell and held the Engineers hitless. Jim Hand, captain
    of the tennis team and the only person to ever roll a 300 game at the Campus
    alleys, was presented with several awards Wed. night by the AMF, American
    Machine & Foundry Company at the Campus lanes. Jim, a senior from San
    Antonio, Texas, racked up his perfect game January 10 of this year while
    bowling with his Phi Kappa Psi fraternity team, eventually de feated in
    Intramural semi-finals. AM F's gifts included a new Am  Flite Blazer Bowling
    Ball and a pair -of bowling shoes. The ball was the type with a streaked
    flame-like surface while the shoes were the mocassin type, cream colored and
    embossed with a small medallion on the elastic tops. The trophy was desk-
    size, consisting of a base with Jim's name and the date of his historic
    moment in sports, topped with the large gold numerals 300. It was the first
    award of its type ever presented by AMF. A  photographer from the Sun- bury

Heading: Is your future up in the air?
Content: As the communications needs of our nation become steadily greater and more
    complex, the Bell Telephone System is continuing its pioneer work in
    microwave by "taking to the air" more and more to get the word across. To
    this end, Western Electric--the manu facturing arm of the Bell System--has
    the monumental task of producing a large part of the microwave transmission
    equipment that knits our country together by shrinking thou sands of miles
    into mere seconds. In spite of its great technological strides, the science
    of radio relay is a rapidly-changing one. And new break-throughs and
    advances are common occurrences. A case in point: our Bell System "TH"
    Microwave Radio Relay. This newest development in long-distance telephone
    transmission will eventually triple the present message-carrying capacity of
    exist ing long-haul radio relay installations. A full- scale system of 6
    working and 2 protection channels can handle 11,000 telephone mes sages at
    the same time. To make microwave work takes a host of special equipment and
    components: relay towers, antennae, waveguides, traveling wave- tubes,
    transistors, etc. But just as important, it takes top-caliber people to help
    us broaden our horizons into such exciting new areas as communication by
    satellites! And microwave is only part of Western Electric's opportunity
    story. We have--right now--hundreds of challenging and rewarding positions
    in virtually all areas of telephony, as well as in development and building
    of defense communications and missile guidance systems for the Government
    So, if your future is "up in the air," you owe it to your career to see
    "what's up" for you at Western Electric. OppartunitiM exist for electrical,
    mechanical, Indus- trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical
    science, liberal arts, and business majors. For mere information, get yoer

Content: -- As the solitary policeman slow ly walked down the deserted street which faced
    the beach, he thought he heard a rumbling above that of the ocean. Fear
    gripped his mind. Oh, no, he thought, not THEM . . . again'! He cautiously
    turned his head, half praying his suspicions to be false. It was THEM; the
    first gentle wave of the tremendous tide of COLLEGE STUDENTS. Coming from
    almost every college and university from Maine to California, they suddenly
    flooded the quiet town of Ft. Lauderdale until all seemed doomed and, then,
    just .as suddenly they ebbed away. Well, tonight w ell set up at least four
    or five hundred two- man patrols, he said to himself. We may have to put
    these kids behind 'bars"' to keep them out of trouble. City Hall is looking
    forward to a few " guests" this year; we can't disappoint them. While he
    stood there, the street became impassable; thousands of fanatical sun-
    worshippers sailed into harbor in their flashy Cor vettes, Cadillacs and
    Impalas. Most of the pale-faced torrent headed for the beaches to begin the
    long torturous process of bak ing; the others headed for oases to wash down
    the dust of the road. Jam sessions and the lim bo provided amusement on the
    beaches during the day; parties and riots kept things lively at night. Most
    of the Bucknellians (of which there were approximately 50 "down South" )
    managed to have fun one way or another. The 34-hour trip down and back was
    more than compensated for by the 89" weather. The drinking I age being 21,
    there was a profu sion of borrowed ID's. Walking I down the beach, the sea
    of faces | seemed to blend together, but jionce in awhile a  familiar one ap
    peared. Friends, long parted, met j again to talk over old times. The street
    dances, held to try i to keep the students off the closed 'beaches, were So
    packed that | dancing was nearly impossible. !But, in spite of all
    hindrances, the undaunted youth of the stu- j dents kept things moving. As
    the last beer can was flung j aside, it was time for the pleased, pooped,
    and peeling, Bucknellians | to start the long trek home. But I the trip was
    far from dull; the | time was spent recalling things | done and seen in the

Content: Lately, comedies have been | giving me a great deal of trouble, mainly because
    they have not | seemed funny. One goes to a comedy primarily to laugh, but I
    when this doesn't happen, and I continues not to happen, one may have to
    conclude that either the films are not comical or he just doesn't have a
    good sense of humor. It all started with Carry on | j Nurse, a British
    movie, with its comedy heavily relying on some i broad, rather unsubtle
    humor. Set in a hospital, it perhaps sym bolically caused me pain even to j
    force myself to laugh, although I j must admit that most of the audi- I ence
    seemed to have inhaled quite I a large amount of the laughing j gas used in
    one of its scenes. I began to seriously worry after a picture that had been
    almost unanimously hailed by critics as "a brilliant satire," "a bundle of
    laughs," and "the best comedy of 1960" came to the Campus. At least I'm All
    Right, Jack did be gin with a truly hilarious scene in which Ian Carmichael
    takes a tour through a candy factory, but as soon as the satire changed from
    commercialism to labor- management relations, the movie, though now
    concerned with a more original theme, became far less humorous and
    entertaining. And it may or may not be co incidental that the film lost much
    of its interest at the time of the entrance of Peter Sellers, whose too
    heavy, serious characteriza tion of shop steward was boring after its first
    ten minutes. Sell ers, I am convinced, is a highly overrated actor (yes,
    even in The Mouse Thai Roared), has an ex traordinarily gifted publicity

    creature named Julie Newmar, I found its plot unimaginatively handled,

Content: Our student broadcasting station has for its call letters "WVBU"--which stands
    for the "Voice of Bucknell Uni versity". If WVBU truly represents that
    voice, it would be wise for Bucknell to speak no more! Numerous weaknesses
    qf the radio station are apparent. First of all, WVBU is designed only for
    Bucknellians, but how can it be at all effective if,many of the students and
    faculty, who live on or nearby the campus, are unable to receive its
    broadcasts clearly? Last year, when the sta tion was relocated, there was
    talk about a new surge of power for WVBU broadcasts. However, more powerful
    transmitting equipment still remains as WVBU's basic | necessity. This one
    item, although stimulating WVBU, would fail to cure its other ills. Being
    the student's radio station, WVBU should cater to the students' interests.
    To do this, i radio programming obviously needs to be increasingly j varied.
    Many students are interested in music which transcends rock and roll and
    jazz (especially the former). This situation warrants an increased number of
    classical programs. Concerts and lectures given on the campus could be taped
    and broadcast. Thus, students who are unable to attend or even those who are
    desirous of a re run could hear such events. WVBU could be used effectively
    in the area of politics. For example, candidates for various student
    organizations could speak to outline their plans. This would enable more of
    the student body to becme acquainted with them. Sports events, especially
    away football and basketball games could be broadcast when other local
    stations do not carry these events. All university-scheduled activities
    should be announced daily. Finally, interviews, debates, and programs
    similar to the television "College Bowl would enable the students to be
    stimulated on an academ ic level. Most of these changes would not increase
    the station's expenditures; the only need would be for more volunteers so
    that WVBU could operate a revamped program sched ule effectively. By
    adapting these revisions, we hope that WVBU will emerge from its extended
    larval stage, and that the re sults of this metamorphosis will be desirable.

Heading: Four Percent Straw
Content: A student revolt against the four percent State sales tax on textbooks and
    school supplies is snowballing across Pennsylvania's 88 college and
    university campuses. The drive has reached the proportions of a State-wide
    lobby ing campaign aimed at the Pennsylvania legislature. Temple University
    is prodding its students to write to their local newspapers, telephone their
    ward leaders, and enlist the support of parents in bringing pressure to bear
    on State legislators. We believe that SFC, the represen tative organ of
    student government here at Bucknell, should sponsor a similar drive against
    this tax. The State sales tax on textbooks and school supplies is an unneces
    sary financial burden on college students in a period when tuition, room and
    board, and prices of texts and other supplies have been rapidly rising.
    Although the tax bite on the individual student is small --probably no more
    than an average of $4 a year--and may not seem to be a heavy burden, neither
    was the straw that broke the camel's back! The average under graduate spends
    between $75 and $100 a year for text books and supplies. This outlay is
    compulsory since we must buy books in order to remain in school. Today, ed
    ucation is a necessity. However, its price is too high for many students,
    and the tax on texts aggravates the prob lem. Backers of the drive point out
    that the loss in state revenue would be negligible--one estimate fixes the
    sum at approximately $500,000. Albeit the small additional $4 cost of texts
    may seem inconsequential to most of us, there are some students who are
    required to work their way through school, and they are the ones who bear
    the brunt of the unnecessary tax levy. It is true that these students are in
    the minor ity. Yet, we are faced with a situation where the force of the
    majority could provide enough impetus to succpr the cause of the minority.
    So far, the campaign initiated by Temple University has had little tangible
    success. Undergraduates have met with apathy in the past in their lobbying
    because most students are not of voting age, and for this reason have not
    been able to sufficiently influence legislators. We hope that a concerted
    push by Bucknell's SFC (with student backing), together with the student
    councils of other colleges will bring favorable results in an effort to
    abolish this unnec essary State tax. _______________________ ____

    officers could be greatly improved. For ex ample, in the recent nominations
    for officers of the Class >of '64, only 32 percent of the women were
    directly represented. The present system operates on a basis emphasizing
    sororities, fratemi- dating students. That kind of smut, Mr. Reiser, is
    typical of the immature attitude so many Buck nellians display when faced
    with an adult situation like the one you describe. The English Department of

    of the many detailed experiences that I made last summer a milestone, j Now
    the time has come to tell ! of some of these experiences such I as how we, a
    small group of col- | lege age girls and fellows, work ed side by side with
    Africans for long hours every day, digging foundations and making bricks to
    I build schoolhouses in the rain forest; how we traveled dark jungle roads
    in the back of trucks to visit other small villages; how ! we danced at a
    huge State Ball, celebrating the independence of a new African nation; how
    we held our breath while eating hot I African food, or sighed a sigh of
    relaxation when climbing onto our mahogany-board beds. More than these
    accounts of action I remember the intangible experiences that in our daily
    liv ing with our African friends help ed dispel their suspicions that all
    Americans hate black people, that every American city is a Little Rock, that
    college students,' or Americans in general, can not do manual labor (because
    we have machines to do everything), and that America is not interested in
    helping Africans strive for inde pendence. I'm not going to tell the whole
    story now, but I will talk and show slides this Sunday evening, April 23, at

    _____________ A-102 Coleman Hall At 7:45 a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a
    Marlborcr, and climbed the bell tower to remove his secretary who had been
    placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates. At 8 a.m. he
    reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with Derther Sigafoos, editor of
    the student newspaper. Young Sigafoos had been writing a series of
    editorials urging the United States to annex Canada. When his editorials had
    evoked no response, hd had taken matters into his own hands. Accom panied by
    his sports editor and two copy readers, he had gone over the border and
    conquered Manitoba. With great patience and several excellent Marlboro
    Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded young Sigafoos to give Manitoba back. Young
    Sigafoos, how ever, insisted on keeping Winnipeg.. At 9 a.m. the Dean lit a
    Marlboro and met with Erwin J. Bender, president of the local Sigma Chi
    chapter, who came to report that the Deke house had been put on top of the
    Sigma Chi house during the night by high-spirited undergraduates. At 10 a.m.
    the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire an intramural softball game on
    the roof of the law school where the campus baseball diamond had been placed
    during the night by high-spirited undergraduates. At 12 noon the Dean had a
    luncheon meeting with the presi dent Ojf the university, the bursar, the
    registrar, and the chair man of the English department at the bottom of the
    campus swimming pool where the faculty dining room had been placed during
    the night by high-spirited undergraduates. Marlboros were passed after
    lunch, but not lit owing to the dampness. At 2 p.m., back in his office, the
    Dean lit a Marlboro and received the Canadian minister of war who said that
    unless young Sigafoos gave back Winnipeg, Canada would march. Young Sigafoos
    was summoned and agreed to give back Winni peg if he could have Saskatoon.
    The Canadian minister of war at first refused, but finally agreed after
    young Sigafpos placed him on the roof of the mining and metallurgy building.
    At 3 p.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with a delegation from the student
    council who came to present him with a set of matched luggage in honor of
    his fifty years' service as dean of students. The Dean promptly packed the
    luggage with his clothing and Marlboros and fled to Utica, New York, where
    he is now in the aluminum siding game. , (r) mi m . i shuim<<>> To the dean
    of students and all you other hard-working academic types , here's the new
    word in smoking pleasure from the makers of Marlboro -- king-size unfiltered
    Philip Morris Commander. Welcome aboard!

Heading: When Choosing Tour
Content: Dear Editor: In a recent issue of the Buck- nellian. there appeared an article
    indicating offers for summer jobs for students in Europe. Among those
    references were some that were no doubt acceptable. How ever, a caution
    should be made in regard to offers made to stu dents who are interested in
    going abroad, either for summer em ployment or for educational pur- poses.
    Some ventures are essentially | rackets in Europe. It is known j that
    commercial tour bureaus j often have misleading 'advertise - 1 ments for
    educational tours and for "prize" European vacations for those who help an
    agency 'find j a prescribed number of prospec tive tourists. In situations
    such as these, there is little, if any, ed ucational 'value in the tour and
    the funds offered to persons never materialize once they've arrived in
    Europe. The very potential of American- European relations can be spoiled by
    accepting too easily some of these announcements at face value. Sincerely,

Heading: THE TAREYTON RIHO
Content: by Stare Skinner

Heading: Benthes
Content: Skinner Goodbye To Winter Following the long winded demise of the winter sports'
    season come fairer days and " green fields." The baskets have been rolled
    into dark comers, the mats have been rolled up, and the pool drained, and a
    young man's fancy turns to--baseball. With the advent of the national
    pastime also appears a deluge of spikes, sweatshirts, and shotputs, as the
    most materially unrewarding sport of them all--track --begins to jog the
    cinder ovals. Accompanying the "demise" of winter sports is a noticeable
    loss in interest in the Bucknell athletics. Reams of material have been
    published about the plight of college baseball and its weak role in the
    annals of American sport. But at the risk of putting my neck upon the
    proverbial chopping block with an idealistic, but unqualified, essay, which
    seems to be so characteristic of this printed medium, the case concerning
    Bucknell baseball and spring sports in general must be stated. The
    Attendance Problem Each April the interest in athletics takes a decided
    downfall, as evidenced by the number (small) of spectators at nearly every
    event, until most intramural contests draw larger crowds than varsity com
    petition. Attendance at track, golf, and tennis meets is practically non-
    existent, and the largest crowd at a baseball game is Mother's Weekend. The
    problem of Spring sports and attendance there at is not to be remedied by a
    generalizing expose of University deficiencies or by coercive mass movement
    to the ball field by "Fans" . Obviously a school the size of Bucknell cannot
    be handing out scholarships to every potentially good athlete. But in
    deference to the athletes who now compete for BU in the Spring, the answer
    is naturally one of personnel and material. How to procure this material is
    purely ad ministrative. Realizing that the administration is engaged in back
    ing scholastic rather than athletic improvement, a more than condon- able
    position, it should be realized that good athletic material often attracts
    good scholastic material.

    backfield posi tions, while a fourth player was considered as a possible
    replace ment for Little All-American Paul Terhes. Listed at the beginning of
    the season as quarterbacks, Norm Garrity, Jim West, and Tom Rich ards have
    been switched to posi tions where "they can do more for the team." In
    Garrity, Coach Odell feels he has "one of the finest defensive backs we've
    had." If Garrity could play at quarter back next season, he would be used
    sparingly, because "his throwing is only ordinary." "Jim West," claims
    Odell, " is another excellent defensive back. W e'll use him for more
    defensive depth." Freshman Tom Rich ards, termed as a "tough guy" was
    switched over to the fullback position where he has been doing a tremendous
    job. Pat Malone, who came to Buck nell as a quarterback but was switched to
    halfback because of the Bisons' Terhes and Elliot, w ill be given another
    shot at the all- important position. "If we had to play a game right now,"
    said Coach Odell, " Doug Williams would be our starting quarterback. He has
    more ex perience than any of the other fellows."

Heading: Golfers Win
Content: The Bucknell golf team finally got a chance to play on their rain- soaked home
    course last Saturday and defeated Colgate 4-3 in a non-MAC match. The
    Bisons, unable to get recent preparation for the meet because of the bad
    weather, got good performances from Bob Schad, Curt Mull, Jerry Singer, and
    sophomore Don Moth- ner, in winning their first test this season. Former
    Middle Atlantic champion Bob Etzweiler, co-cap tain of the Bucknell team
    found rough competition in the first spot and lost 2 and 1. Schad, who last
    year had a 68 here the same day Etzweiler had a 69 against G-Burg, played in
    the number two position and beat his . opponent on the 16th hole, 3 and !2.
    Curt Mull was low man for the Bisons, carding a 75 and win ning handily, 6
    and 5. Pete Sang, a junior, playing in the fourth position, lost- on the
    last hole, 1 up. Jerry Singer won 2 and 1, Ted Casey, a soph, was defeated 6
    and 5, while first year man Don Mothfier won 2 and 1. To Odell, Don Rodgers
    is the best playing freshman. "He throws very well," claimed the coach, "and
    his biggest drawback is his lack of experience." Ron Giordano has
    particularly impressed the coaching staff with his determination. "He's the
    kind of guy who gets the job done." The number of quarterbacks is now down
    to six, but the starting player for next season still re mains unknown.

Content: I The Bucknell track team lost its first two encounters on the cinder pathways
    by the lopsided scores of 95-38% to Temple and 103-28 to Lafayette during
    the past week. Last Saturday in Philadelphia the Bisons could manage only
    one first place as A rt Lemkau took the javelin, while Dick Boddie managed a
    tie for the top spot in the high jump. Bucknell could capture only six
    second places as Boddie was runner-up in the 220 low hurdles, Ron Andreuzzi
    was second in the broad jump, A rt second in the discus, Bob DeCamp in the
    880, Buzzy Holmes in the 440, and Ray Keeney in the pole vault. Tuesday the
    Bison cindermen traveled to Easton, Pa., where they were walloped by
    Lafayette by a margin of 75 points. Dick Boddie was a one-man show as he
    took three firsts, the only top honors Bucknell collected all af ternoon on
    the soggy track. Bod die won the 120 high hurdles, the 220 low hurdles, and
    high jump with a leap o f 5' 10" . Buzzy Holmes took a second in the 100
    yard dash, run at a slow 10.4. Bob DeCamp finished second in the 880 as did
    Jeff Martin in the two mile run. The track team w ill run for the first time
    this season in Memorial Stadium this Saturday at 2 p. m. when they
    participate in a tri meet with Delaware and Muhlen- burg. PAGE

Content: Something Should Be Done Each source of material can benefit Bucknell greatly,
    but this is not an essay based on fault-finding, but rather an analysis of
    the rec ord book. Rather, it is enough to say that some effort, not neces
    sarily financial assistance, should be made in the direction of improv ing
    Spring sports to the level enjoyed by the fall and winter teams or the long
    run results could be conceivably detrimental. Perhaps some of the blame for
    poor attendance falls upon this page. However, every schedule is printed at
    one time or another, often duplicated in a later issue, and most events are
    given a small preview, but if no one read the sports section and Spring
    teams were on a higher than present caliber, there would be fans. The
    thought that the* so-called " apathy," said to be currently afflicting the
    student body, ranges into the world of sport is too awful to comprehend. The
    Luck of the Draw A  possible method of gatheringO* good athletes could be
    one of re cruiting through persuasion and providing a knowledge of Buck
    nell. Some limited help could be suggested, but an accent could also be on
    the "opportunity to play ball" factor and the "build ing process." Using
    a"snowjob" routine might pay off in the at traction of very good men to the
    school. A t least the success of Spring sports should not be de termined by
    the luck of the draw. If Bucknell is to maintain high standards
    scholastically, and there is every indication that it intends to do so, and
    athletically each fall and winter, then why not in the Spring also? This
    Spring, especi ally, Bison teams need support from the students for even one
    team to win more than it loses. * * * * As if the problem of insufficient
    material were not enough, the poor attitude of the material at hand is
    doubly serious. Last week the Intramural track meet attract ed more fans
    than all the varsity meets combined, and while some of the "Fraternal
    Athletes" could help Bucknell on the cinders, they are not the real
    offenders. The track team went to Lafay ette without five of their best men.
    A  co-captain is no longer with the team. Several letter- men now have their
    sweaters and so have "retired" to rest on their laurels. There's not much
    dedi cation in that crowd. The above situation leaves clouds of speculation,
    but not a very good solution, But some thing should be done about this
    condition or there won't be a track team. And what's worse yet is, that
    after it's gone, w ill anyone care? Nowadays many college men live by the
    sweat o f their frau.

    this end, Western Electric--the manu facturing arm of the Bell System--has
    the monumental task of producing a large part of the micfowave transmission
    equipment that knits our country together by shrinking thou sands of miles
    into mere seconds.. In spite of its great technological strides, ' the
    science of radio relay is a rapidly-changing one. And new break-throughs and

    Microwave Radio Relay. This newest development in long-distance telephone
    transmission will eventually triple the present message-carrying capacity of
    exist ing long-haul radio relay installations. A  full- scale system of 6
    working and 2 protection channels can handle 11,000 telephone mes sages at
    the same time. To make microwave work takes a host of special equipment and
    components: relay towers, antennae, waveguides, traveling wave- tubes,
    transistors, etc. But just as important, it takes top-caliber people to help
    us broaden our horizons into such exciting new areas as communication by
    satellites! And microwave is only part of Western Electric's opportunity

    Joel Flegler By the time this article is print ed, Bernard Haitink and the
    Am sterdam Concertgebouw Orches tra will have left the campus to continue
    their tour. Though the average person knows little about the orchestra that
    performed here last night, he knows even less about the young man who con
    ducted it. . The latter is not surprising, ,for, until last year, Haitink
    was a comparatively unknown conduc tor to those in the United States. What
    happened to change all this was the unfortunate death of Ed ward van Beinum
    in 1959; at the age of 29, Haitink was asked to take over the position of
    what many consider the greatest or chestra in Europe. Until that time,
    Haitink had been the permanent conductor of the Netherlands Radio Philhar
    monic and had appeared with every other leading symphonic organization in
    Holland and the Bavarian State Radio Orchestra in Munch. It was in 1957 that
    the ailing van Beinum selected him as a substitute at a concert in Los
    Angeles, an event which ultimately led to Haitink's being chosen as the
    maestro's successor and his subsequent American tour. Does Haitink merit his
    new re- spbnsibility? Judging from his recording of Dvorak's Symphony No. 7,
    in D minor, released on Epic Records last year, I would be forced to answer
    that question with a resounding "Yes!" Sev eral years ago, I became acquaint
    ed with Dvorak's lovely work through a Decca recording with Ferdinand
    Leitner (who, incident ally, was one of Haitink's teach ers) conducting the
    Berlin Phil harmonic. Listening to it then, I I thought that the symphony
    had its enjoyable moments but was a trifle ponderous and long. It was not
    until I bought Haitink's ver sion, his first American recording, that my
    mind was completely changed about the piece. The main reason for this is
    that Haitink conducts in a manner that is very exciting. His is not the
    "heart-on-sleeves" approach of so many conductors today toward "Romantic"
    works (Eugene Or- mandv being the most outstand ing offender)^ he simply
    lets the music speak for itself. His tem pos are perfectly chosen, and, if
    they seem a little faster than one is accustomed to, this is all for the
    better in music of this type. Predicts Performance Unfortunately, this
    article is being written before the concert, but if his performance of
    Dvorak last evening was even half as good as the one I have enjoyed
    listening to over and over again during my leisure hours, then music lovers
    had an all-too-rare treat. For those interested in classical recordings,
    Haitink's disc performance of Dvorak's sym phony has been acclaimed the

    high praise. This last recording is especially interesting, since Haitink
    began his own career as a violinist. He, himself, says, " I was not a very
    good violinist, and that's why I became a conductor." In less than six years
    since his discovery, then, he has risen from one of the many violinists in
    the Dutch Radio Symphony Orchestra to the leader of one of the world's

Heading: Students Discuss Merits o f Each
Content: by Joel Flegler There simply exists no com parison between the comedies I am
    reviewing this week and those I criticized in last week's column. I can only
    say that it seems im possible that in less than a week, two truly
    outstanding examples of comedy have been shown at Bucknell. Of course I am
    refer ring to the Campus' School for Scoundrels and Hilltop's The Con
    fession of Felix Krull. The memory of the College of Lifemanship will linger
    for quite some time in the minds of those of us who felt a comradeship to
    wards Henry Pulfrey and his plight. Because there's a little bit of all of
    us in Pulfrey (the first Pulfrey, I mean), his success in outwitting his
    dumbfounded opponent and winning the girl he loves is enjoyable to watch--in
    credible as it might actually be. Ian Carmichael, as the con scientious
    student from a "col lege" that offers a most disthic- j tive curriculum, and
    Terry- Thomas, as the villain whose confidence and conceit are com pletely
    shaken, once more show their versatility. It is simply pure pleasure to
    watch them act. If Carmichael is the successor of Alec Guiness, let us hope
    that he continues making more films, like this one, that are the equal of
    those wonderful pictures that Guiness unfortunately stopped doing several
    years ago. I don't believe, as some do, that Sellers is the answer, and
    Carmichael has already proven that he can do it. In short, this is the best
    British comedy that I have seen since Adventures of Sadie. After my
    enthusiasm for School for Scoundrels, I hardly know what to say about the
    1957 Ger man film that "brought down the house" at Hilltop two weeks ago.
    Some may not consider a movie like The Confessions of Felix Krull as " art,"
    but such intellect ual snobbery is dispelled by just viewing the scene in
    which Krull, at his "physical" for the German army, tricks the Medical
    Board, surely one of the masterpieces of comedy in contemporary motion
    pictures. Credit for much of the film's ' entertainment must go to its star,
    Horst Buchholz, who, some may remember, as a young gunman, helped make The
    Magnificent Seven a better "Western" than most. Here, as Krull, he gives the
    character an honesty and special type of naivete that go a long way into
    making him such a likeable rogue. Kurt Hoffman must also be applauded for
    his masterful direction; rarely does one see cutting and editing used with
    such smoothness and variety. When the lights came on at the end of almost
    two hours, there were few in the audience who would not have wished that it

Content: 

Heading: Blaze Bravery
Content: On behalf of Bucknell student body, we would like to commend the Lewisburg Fire
    Department for the highly efficient job they did in controlling the fire
    which devas tated the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity House last week. In the
    face of roaring flames and billowing smoke, the Lewisburg firemen bravely
    attacked the blaze and pre vented it from endangering more lives and
    wreaking havoc on more houses in the area. , Several members of SPE were
    trapped on the roof of their burning house and were rescued from their
    precari ous predicament only by the prompt action of the firemen. Only those
    who witnessed the terror and destruction caused by the fire could fully
    appreciate the danger that the Lewisburg firemen so unflinchingly faced.
    Gentle men, we take our hats off to you! W e would like, also, to acclaim
    the Bucknell students who were present at the catastrophe for their willing
    as sistance too the firemen. Several students helped to carry hoses and
    ladders, thus enabling more firemen to combat the spreading blaze. In
    addition, students helped to trans port the members of SPE to temporary
    accommodations in East College, and provided aid to those men who suf fered
    from the effects of the smoke and the stifling heat. The IFC has taken
    immediate initiative to sponsor a clothing drive for the members of SPE who
    were left des titute by the conflagration. Since the majority of the
    students who lived in the house lost all their possessions in the fire, the
    rest of us at Bucknell will be heavily re lied upon to further contribute
    our assistance in helping these people to get back on their feet. Because of
    this tragedy, the student body is presented with a chance to work side by
    side in aiding these unfor tunate victims of the fire. W e know that we can
    count on your support!

Heading: Hats Off!
Content: When approximately 2,000 people came to Davis Gym nasium last week, they not
    only heard a great orchestra perform but were present at the finale of this
    year's Artist Series, perhaps the most rewarding of those ever had at
    Bucknell. It would be a safe assumption to say that near ly all those who
    heard them were impressed by Van Cli- burn's sensitive piano technique, the
    Festival Quartet's intimate playing, and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Or
    chestra's brilliant executions. The less said about the Solov Ballet the
    better. While the size of the audiences at the concerts this year have been
    anything but spectacular (with the exception of Clibum's), attendance has
    decidedly improved over the past few years. Unfortunately, there is still a
    consider able percentage of students who are not desirous of taking
    advantage of these rare opportunities. These students are not only denying
    themselves the possibilities of being deeply stimulated, but they are
    actually paying for some thing of which they do not partake. Some might
    think that the latter is unjust, but since a university's aim should be to
    educate its students as best it can, supplying them with the finest in art
    is one way to help accomplish this goal. One cannot imagine that the
    fulfillment of this aspect of the goal could be in more capable hands than
    Lindsey Merill's, the man in charge of the Artist Series. Much to his
    credit, Mr. Merrill has not compromised his tastes with those of the general
    level of cultural interest (or, rather, disinterest) of the majority of
    students on this campus; instead he has sought to bring to Bucknell only the
    highest quality, and has well succeeded in doing so. One look at next year's
    program shows that he seems quite set upon outdoing 'himself again, with
    such artists as the Goldovsky Grand Opera Theater, the Berlin Phil harmonic,
    Richard Tucker, and Isaac Stern. What else is there to say, except, "Thank
    you, Mr. Mer rill."

Content: The Bucknell Chapter of Delta! Zeta sorority recently submitted to Panhellenic
    Council a proposal for sophomore year rushing. The proposal has been
    considered by each sorority, with varying reac- j tions. Since the proposal
    includes I the suggestion of open dorms, and j since it affects all women at
    least indirectly, Panhellenic Council has decided to submit it to WSGA | for
    consideration. To complement partial knowl- edge of the Proposal and to cor-
    j rect misinformation concerning it, The Bucknellian would like to (c)
    Inasmuch as a . certain amount of surface technique and politics is involved
    neces sarily in the business of rush, open dorms would provide more
    opportunities for freshman women to view and understand rush from the
    sorority point of view, and would enable them to make a more realistic decis
    ion as to whether or not they wish to become a part of this system. Better

    may contact Carolyn Schaaf or j Barbara Weaver. Delta Zeta has voted that
    the I following proposal be brought to Panhellenic Council for consider-1
    ation: PROPOSAL: that formal rush be deferred until the begin- [ ning of the
    sophomore year and that all dorms be opened following the first six weeks j
    of the first semester (about mid-semesters). We list the following arguments
    I in support of this proposal:

Heading: I.
Content: In the Rushing situation open dorms would provide a more real istic atmosphere.
    (a) Open dorms would allow | both freshman and upperclass women to get to
    know each other as they choose in the rel atively relaxed and natural at
    mosphere of the dormitories and would not limit their ac quaintances and
    impressions to those made in the strained din ing hall situation. (b) Open
    dorms would permit the freshmen and upperclass j women alike to better
    distin- i guish between a real personal interest in each other and the mere
    forced smiles of rush. IFC Scholarship Applications are now avail able in
    the Dean of Men's of fice for IFC's $300 scholarship. The deadline is May 1.

Content: by Judy Montgomery About That Cold! . . . from the Syracuse Daily Orange: I'd
    like to tell you about this cold I had. It was really a pretty terrible
    cold, you might say, because I thought it was going to last forever. It did
    finally go away, however, which encourages me to go on. It all started
    sometime last November when I started to cough and sneeze. Shortly after I
    caught the cold, I read this magazine article that told how most colds are
    actually psychosomatic--caused by some mental problem instead of really
    catching a bug. And I began to wonder what was causing this one. I had been
    running around in the rain without a jacket on, but I couldn't figure what
    that could symbolize and I began to wonder if it went back to some childhood
    experience. Then my cold got worse.- I spent'a weekend in this mountain
    cabin without a fireplace, and when I got back I had a really sore throat
    and a hacking cough. I figured the imagery that is generally associated with
    spending a weekend in the woods must somehow have caused an undesirable
    mental association. Just when I thought I had the cold psychoanalyzed, it
    got that much worse. I decided there must be some serious mental conflict
    going on in my subconscious--you know, below the (evel of reason. Maybe I
    was insecure or had an inferiority complex. I wondered if I was punishing
    myself for catching a cold in the first place. I was hesitant to ask my
    friends about it, but they assured me that being mentally sick was just the
    same as being physically ill. One of my friends who is very secure said that
    most people will tell you about the time they had whooping cough or
    tonsillitis, but he told people all the time about when he had paranoia and
    manic de pression. I was just trying to figure out whether there was any
    connection between my cough and the fact that I was once knocked unconscious
    by an icicle, when another friend who is very stupid and doesn't read much
    suggested that I go to the infirmary. "Take one of these each hour and get
    plenty of rest," he said; I followed his advice. And then the. funiest thing
    happened. Just like that my cold disappeared. Only trouble is, I can't
    figure out what the pills symbolized psy chologically. Undoubtedly something
    deeply, buried in my past. One of the pills was white and looked like an
    aspirin, and probably doesn't symbolize much of anything. It's the other
    pill that disturbs me. It was vaguely like the color of a rose. A A -A A Two
    truisms from the Pitt News: "The rules for success are just bound to work if
    you do." " Speak to please yourself, and you'll have a captive audience."

Content: * * The Keystonian of Keystone Jr. College offers this definition of a kiss,:
    Kiss--a noun, though more often used as a conjunction; it is never declined;
    it is more common than proper, usually used in the plural, and agrees with
    all genders. freshman women two semesters to adjust academically and to make
    their grades. (b) Deferred rush would pro vide us with a more reasonable
    length of time to establish closer acquaintances with a greater number of
    women. (c) Deferred rush would enable freshmen to view their chances with
    certain groups more real istically and would eliminate such needless
    disappointment. (d) Since many close freshman groups are split up
    necessarily by the housing procedures, the sophomores would make their
    sorority choices more individ ually without the pressures exerted by many
    freshman hall groups to join a particular sor ority or just any sorority at
    all.

Heading: III.
Content: Deferred Rush would help to strengthen sororities on the Bucknell campus. (a)
    Under the present system, sororities devote the major por tion of their time
    and energies to rushing in the first semester and to orientation of pledges
    during the second semester. With deferred rush, sororities could denote more
    time to more worthwhile and meaningful functions--social, cultural, phi
    lanthropic, etc. (b) With deferred rush sorori ties would not need to (and
    for that matter, could not) rush throughout a whole year at the same
    intensity that is maintain ed for one semester. (c) Since open dorms and de
    ferred rush would provide rushees with better opportuni ties for making
    realistic soror ity decisions, sororities would benefit by pledging more con
    genial groups who would be genuinely enthusiastic about sorority life. (d)
    Deferred rush and open dorms would eliminate the sophomore disenchantment
    and would cut down on deactiva tions. Objectives Answered In addition to
    these arguments for the proposal, we have tried to anticipate some of the
    more valid arguments against this pro posal and to these we present counter-
    arguments: 1. During the period of transi tion, nationals and perhaps some
    local chapters may com plain about the lag of mem bers and money. Remember,
    we will experience this lag for only one semester, and even at that we will
    not lose any class. Also, we can fill our quotas (if we so desire) with
    pick-ups from the three upper classes during this period of transition. Many
    more women may de cide to go independent when they find they have already
    managed very nicely on their own. Most of these women would not make good
    sorority women anyhow and would probably dampen sorority en thusiasm and'
    self-cpnfidence if they had joined in their freshman year, thinking it was
    the thing to do. Letters to the Editor |

Heading: A ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME
Content: As Commencement Day draws near, the question on everyone's lips is: " How did
    the different disciplines come to be marked by academic robes with hoods of
    different colors?" Everybody-- but everybody --is asking it. I mean I
    haven't been able to walk ten feet on any campus in America without somebody
    grabs my elbow and says, "How did the different disciplines come to be
    marked by academic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?" This, I must
    say, is not the usual question asked by collegians who grab my elbow.
    Usually they say, " Hey, Shorty, got a Marlboro?" And this is right and
    proper. After all, are they not collegians, and, therefore, the nation's
    leaders in intelligence and discernment? And do not intelligence and
    discernment de mand the tastiest in tobacco flavor and smoking pleasure? And
    does not Marlboro deliver a flavor that is uniquely mellow, a selectrate
    filter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, a box that is hard? You
    know it! But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes. A
    doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears green, a master
    of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities wears crimson, a master of
    library science wears lemon yellow. Why? Why, for example, should a master
    of library science wear lemon yellow? Well sir, to answer this vexing
    question, we must go back to March 29, 1844. On that date the first public
    library in the United States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
    Sigafoos's neighbors were of course wildly grateful--ail, that is, except
    Wrex Todhunter. Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both
    men had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had chosen Mr. Sigafoos
    because she was mad for dancing and Mr. Sigafoos knew all the latest steps,
    like the Missouri Compromise Mambo, the Shay's Rebellion SchottiSche, and
    the James K. Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all
    owing to a ivound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans. (He was
    struck by a falling praline.) Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr.
    Sigafoos'>> library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.
    This he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr. Sigafoos. "What
    has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven't got?" Mr. Todhunter kept asking himself,
    and finally the answer came to him: books. So Mr. Todhunter stocked his
    library with lots of dandy books and soon he was doing more business than
    his hated rival. But Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he
    began serving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There upon,
    Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea with sugar. Thereupon,
    Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with sugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr.
    Todhunter began serving tea with sugar and cream and lemon. This, of course,
    clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be cause he had the only lemon tree
    in town--in fact, in the entire state of North Dakota--and since that day
    lemon yellow has of course been the color on the academic robes of library
    science. (Incidentally^ the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library and
    moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There were,, to be
    sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but, alas, there was no cream
    because the cow was not introduced to California until 1931 by John Wayne.)
    (c) IM] Maishuim*>> And today Californian>>, happy among their Guernseys and
    Holsteins, are discovering a great new cigarette--the un altered, king-size
    Philip Morris Commander--and so are Americans in all fifty states. Welcome

Content: by Ted Odenwald In the past week the Bison golf squad won two of three meets
    while the track squad placed second in a three team meet. The golf team
    dropped a 4-3 decision Saturday to a strong Navy squad. The winner of each
    inividual match was determined by the number of holes won. Bob Schad, the
    Bison's number one man, was eliminated on the 14th hole by Midshipman Bill
    Cattlet. Bucknellian Bob Etzweiler had the, closest match of the afternoon
    as he finished all 18 holes with a stroke lead. Pete Sang and Don Mothner
    each won, victories for the Bucknell cause, eliminating their opponents on
    the 16th and 15th holes, respectively. Navy golfers Tom Haney, Mike Moore,
    and Walt Martin defeated their respective Bison opponents, Curt Mull, Jerry
    Singer, and Ted Casey. New Scoring Method The next two Bison matches were
    scored differently. The in dividual leading after the first nine holes
    received one point as did the individual who had the lowest score for the
    second 18. The winner also received one ex tra point. The Bisons easily
    defeated Del aware 13V2-4V2 in an MAC match. Bob Schad, Bob Etzweiler, Jerry
    Singer, Pete Sang, and Ted Casey each earned a win. Only Mull failed to
    score a win. Schad had the low score of the day with a fine 73 total. The
    closest Bisons were Etzweiler and Mull, each with a 79. The golf squad
    turned in an other excellent performance in trouncing Lafayette, 13 Vi to 4
    Vi. Schad, Etzweiler, Mull, Singer, and Casey each took a victory, with Mull
    and Singer each win ning on shutouts. Pete Sang was the only Bison to lose.
    Bucknell's low shooters were Singer, 76, Etz weiler, 77, and Schad, 80. The
    Bisons failed to have one man .finish in first place as they j wound up

    to Lehigh 8-1 last Saturday. The lone winner was Bob Heuman who defeated
    Murry Rust, 6-3, 6-3 at the fifth singles. Jim Hand and Mike Nachwalter
    forced their men into three sets - before they lost. Disaster struck last
    Wednesday at Haverford as the Bisons lost 9-0. They failed to win one set.
    The team expects to get back on the winning trail this Saturday when they
    meet Upsala at 1:30 on the Seventh Street Courts. If it's true that baseball
    coaches and managers live and die with every pitch that's thrown, then
    Bucknell mentor Rod Oberlin has probably carried himself to a mental
    graveyard more times than one man deserves. While inwardly hoping that
    Oberlin doesn't have to hold his breath each time his representative on the
    mound delivers the "goods," the average spectator should have some idea of
    Rod's ordeal after analyzing the following statistics. In four games this
    spring season the baseball team has bobbled the ball 23 times. In contrast
    they have collected only 25 hits, 20 divided among four players, and have
    scored 15 runs. Fourteen of those runs were earned. Here comes the part that
    must give Oberlin gray hairs. Gray-Hairsville The opposition has crossed
    home plate exactly 35 times in the four contests. Thanks to the "Terrible-
    Twenty-Three" the enemy has been able to score .22 of those 35 tallies with
    the assistance of the Bisons. They (the opposition) have earned but 13 of
    the runs against Bucknell in the four games. They've banged out 39 hits,
    however, and have made only four bungles on the field. While realizing that
    overall experience is not at a premium in the interests of pride and Mr.
    Oberlin's health there is obviously only one method by which each Bison
    baseball game can be prevented from becoming a heart rending "Comedy of
    Errors" . [ The professor who comes in 15 I minutes late is rare--in fact,
    he's in a class by himself. Secretary to her downhearted boss whose desk is
    piled high with papers: "Allowing, for holi day excitement, office parties,
    postseason letdown and normal absenteeism, we should have De- # cember's
    work cleaned up by January 25th." ____ Football's Not Carefree , Coach
    Oberlin may have his problems on the diamond, but Coach Bob Odell is not
    entirely free from worry or care himself. He is still sounding the depth of
    talent at his disposal for a "replacement for Paul Terhes at quarterback, as
    indicated in last week's somewhat poetically but illegibly titled story, "OD
    Searches for QB" . The is sue will probably not be solved until next fall.
    In the meantime Odell has the trouble of getting enough football players
    together to hold a practice. As if afternoon labs weren't enough to cut down
    the number present when the first wind-sprint whistle blows, the fact that
    no less than 13 men are sidelined by aches and pains, with others prob- j
    ably on the way (one week of practice left), has not allowed Odell much
    mobility in position determination. Weak Kneed Individuals? No less than
    five knees, the Achillie's Heel of almost every ath lete, have been banged
    up seriously. Sophs Bob Aleva, Tom Rich ards, and Mike Seigfried, as well as
    junior George Rieu, and senior Bill Urch are out of action. Urch received a
    cartilage operation last- week. Besides Don Chaump, Walt Mayer, and Denny
    Morgan who are sitting out'" practice because of last season's wounds. Bob
    Williams is recovering from a bout with "Mono" . The Crippled Herd Tom's
    Alexander and Noteware have been decommissioned by back and leg injuries,
    respectively, while Kirk Foulke, captain of next fall's "Herd" is out with a
    broken finger. Dick Tyrrel is cur rently sporting *a cast thanks to a
    chipped c-lbow. And so on ad in finitum. The ironic part of all this
    disability is that padding is get ting better and more extensive as each
    season progresses.

    in Vaughan Literature Au ditorium. Because a passport was denied him, Voight
    obtained a second hand captain's uniform and be came the commander of a
    squad of soldiers in the Kaiser's Im perial Army, a position he quick ly
    took advantage of by ordering his men to arrest the Mayor of] Koepenick and
    taking him to j Berlin. What happened to Voight and his amazing masquerade
    provides for unusual entertainment in this film that is based on Carl Zuck-
    mayer's classic comedy. When first released in 1956, The Cap- lain from
    Koepenick received rave reviews from most news papers and is now generally
    con sidered to be one of the best Ger man films of post-war years. Italy,
    Roberto Rossellini had first scored an international success with his Open
    City and Paisan, both made when World War II had just ended, had done many
    films since then that had nearly all failed (deservedly so), and had finally
    completed another "mas terpiece" . Never a worshipper of Rossel lini's
    films, however, I approached General Della Rovere with a small amount of
    apprehension. Although there was much to be said for the realism of Open
    City, I thought that it had touched too often only the surface of events and
    persons and had missed the real warmth of the Italian people, a quality I
    hoped was present in his new motion picture. Instead, I found in General Del
    la Rovere that he had repeated the old formula again with one factor added:
    neo-triteness. At least in Open City, his characters, even the Germans, had
    an air of sustains one's interest in this long film. Indeed, he is the only
    char acter one believes in, except until his last 20 minutes when his rapid
    change from coward to hero is done with too much heroics and little enough
    truth. If only time had been spent concentrating on him instead of the
    numerous shots illustrating the pride and anguish of the Italian people, the
    whole film might have been much bet ter! As it is, Vittorio de Sica is so
    good in the lead that his per formance justifies the making of the movie.
    Getting back to Mr. Rossellini, I wonder if the reason he return ed to the
    subject of the Italian people in wartime was because he thought he had
    something new to say or because his other state ments had somewhat failed.
    If it were for the former reason,

    the SFC had previously recommended to the Budget Com mittee. The Budget
    Committee feels that, with some reorganization on the part of Touche, the
    sum of $500 will be adequate. Suggest ion by the committee for a more
    economical operation of the mag azine next year are as follows: 1. That
    Touche publish three issues annually instead of the usual four. 2. That the
    length of each is sue be increased by ten pages. 3. That the subscription
    rate be increased from $1.00 to $1.50 and the single rate from $.25 to $.50.

Content: Social privileges of the Sigma | Phi Epsilon and Theta Chi fra- i ternities have
    been curtailed be- j ! cause of a violation of University j social
    regulations, according to j # John C. Hayward, dean of student1 | affairs.
    Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity! ! has been denied the privilege o f : holding
    social events of any kind at any place for the remainder of \ the semester.
    Theta Chi may not j hold any social events during the I I first seven weeks
    of the first se- j j mester next year, with the excep- j i tion of
    Homecoming and Parents Weekend. The action curtailing social ac- \ \
    tivities by the two fraternities j | was taken after the SPE fratem- j ity
    held an unregistered dance on | Saturday evening, April 22, at the | Theta
    Chi house, Dean Hayward j said. The Theta Chi's had offered the use of their
    house to the Sig I Eps for their annual Skid Row Party following the fire
    which had destroyed the SPE house. | Student representatives of the two
    fraternities report that the failure to register the event properly was due
    to a misunder standing about which fraternity was responsible for completing
    the arrangements. University regulations require that every social event
    sponsored by a fraternity be registered in advance through the office of the
    dean of men. Word of the penal ties for the two fraternities was
    communicated to the chapter presidents. It was pointed out that the action
    was taken after a careful review of the circum stances under which the
    unregis tered dance was held. This weekend Bucknell Univer-1 sity once again
    is hostess to the parents of her students during the I annual Spring
    Festival. This !weekend especially honors the Mothers, as its fall
    counterpart does the Dads. Today, tomorrow, | and Sunday there are many pro
    grams which are planned in honor of our guests. Some of the highlights
    include the student art exhibit, Cap and Dagger.'s production of James
    Thurber's The Male Animal, the ROTC Review and Federal In spection, and, of
    course, the tra ditional May Day ceremonies, with the presentation of the
    May Court and crowning of the Queen. A complete schedule of all the
    activities and the times and places is printed below. Special recog nition
    must be given to William FletemeyOr, who coordinated the program for this
    entire weekend. The outstanding musical pro gram of the college year will be
    held Saturday evening, May 6, : when the seventh annual Festival of Music is

Content: by Bill Danneberg When I was very young, my grandfather (r) ^ o u t h  '09) told
    ' me a story about a little school (they were called colleges then) ttiat |
    had a real problem. It was a social problem and involved a conflict between
    the administration and the student body. The students simply loved to throw
    pebbles in a river that flowed near the campus | (Actually, the river was
    below the camps, so there was never any danger of flooding.) Every weekend,
    the male students would get dates and go down to the riverbank and chuck
    pebbles m the water; not big pebbles, but just little ones, the kind that
    are polished smooth i by the natural flow of water and silt.
    ................. riverO ' Chucking pebbles in. the J became so popular that
    every Fri day aftemon the riverbank be came very crowded; there was I some
    pushing and shoving, and J every once in a while someone would get hit on
    the back of the I head with a pebble thrown by an underclassman who had not
    yet acquired the skill of lofting the pebbles high enough over the !crowd.
    In time, groups of stu dents banded together and chose their respective
    places on the riverbank from which they threw pebbles. This worked out
    fairly well, since everyone knew where he belonged, and no one got hit on
    the head, and there was very little pushing and shoving. However, the
    administration felt that this pebble-throwing had gotten out of hand, and
    decided that some form of control over I the actions of the students was i
    needed. After all, the adminis- i tration had to know when the | students
    were throwing pebbles, i because everyone knew and un- : derstood that all
    college students j (as they were called then) were irresponsible and could
    hardly be ! expected to govern their own ac-

Heading: OFFICIAL STUDENT PUBLICATION
Content: pear Editor, On behalf of the Lewisburg Fre Department, I would like to ex press
    our thanks for the compli mentary editorial in the issue of April 28. This
    editorial makes all of us feel that our work--from training and ! equipment
    to student body and the administra- j tion are trying to make Bucknell j an
    intellectual, Ivy League uni versity by restricting social activi ties.
    Perhaps they would accom-i plish their goal more quickly by unified ~
    pebbTe-throwing' spirit to supporting such intellectual ac-; conflict with
    studying. The only maintaining the tivities as the forth-coming opera j
    trouble was that one day a pebble actual fire-fighting! instead of allowing^
    them ' to j happened to hit a high school tivities (they would learn to gov
    ern themselves after they had graduated). Thus, a policy of registering all
    pebble-throwing was started, and written permis sion was necessary before
    the students could gather for organ ized pebble-throwing. The policy did
    much to solve the problem because now everyone knew when everyone else was
    throwing pebbles, and the administration could control the number of peb
    bles that were going into the river (thus eliminating any possibility of a
    flood). But, one weekend, one of the pebble-throwing groups forgot to
    register their pebble-throwing; it wasn't that they didn't want to register
    their pebble-throwing, it's just that this group didn't know they were going
    to throw pebbles that weekend until Friday morn ing. You see, one of the
    pebble- throwing groups had the misfor tune of losing all their pebbles
    -when the river rose a bit because of a spring shower; so, another group
    decided to share their peb bles with the unfortunate ones, and in the mix-
    up, the pebble throwing was not registered. (It was too late to register the
    activ ity anyway, and a rising river is no excuse for unorthodox pro
    cedure). This was a serious vio lation of the rules, and as a re sult, both
    groups lost their peb ble-throwing privileges for a while. I am not quite
    sure what hap pened after that, but I believe \ that my grandfather said
    that it worked out well in the end, be cause the next year the adminis
    tration put an end to the pebble- 1 throwing for everyone . . . and ' this
    was good because everyone became very serious and very j stagnant, and
    instead of throwing i pebbles in the river, they threw pebbles at each
    other. This was good too, because there was no --is appreciated and

    sources is a better indi- Jcator of the worth of the depart- 1 ment. The
    praise received from the j SPE fire is especially meaningful I since it was
    an extremely difficult fire to fight and the damage was high. When people,
    outside the fire service, who are not aware of the principles and tactics of
    fire fighting, are able to look at the SPE house and praise what was done
    there they confirm our be lief that we did a good job there. Sincerely

    was re located, there was not only talk of a boost in power, but there was a

    possible for us to broadcast to the entire^ county with our present
    equipment plus one antenna. This would surely stimulate ,the interest of the
    stu- def in WVBU. It would also stimulate the interest of the FCC (Federal
    Communications Com mission). We realize that more varied programming is a
    necessity. At the present time we broadcast only four hours of classical
    music weekly compared to 14 of rock- and-roll. While we realize this is not
    a very satisfactory ratio, it must also be noted that the rock- and-roll
    programs are the only ones from which we have receiv ed any response. . Your

    interest in our broadcasting more classical music. It is only through
    student response that we can realize the pealing to all musical tastes in-

Heading: FOR W RITING ABILITY
Content: In the future, prospective law students will need to pay more attention to the
    development of their writing skill and their knowledge of this country's cul
    tural background. Beginning next November, the Law School Admission Test,
    now required by 86 of the nation's law schools, will include separate tests
    of writing ability and general background. This announcement was made today
    by the executive committee of the Law School Ad mission Test Policy
    Committee at the Conference of Western Law Schools, meeting at Stanford Uni
    versity, Palo Alto, California. The 80-minute writing ability test is
    designed to measure the student's command of grammar and diction as well as
    his ability to recognize verbose or unclear writing. It will test his skill
    in organizing ideas and require him to demonstrate his competence by re-
    writing and editing prose pas sages. The main purpose of the test of general
    background is to measure the student's awareness of the intellectual and
    cultural context in which the law func tions. The test is designed to
    indicate the candidate's under standing of important ideas, events and
    cultural developments of the past and present. It will include 90 questions
    --30 in each of the three fields bf humanities, science and social science.
    In its present form, the Law School Admission Test is admin istered in a
    single half-day ses sion and is designed to measure aptitudes closely
    related to spe cific aspects of the study of law. With the addition of the
    two new tests, the scope of the test will be broadened to include the meas
    urement of achievement in the areas of writing and knowledge of cultural
    background and it will occupy a full day. Separate scores will be reported
    on the aptitude test, the writing test, and the test of general background.
    The Law School Admission Test is administered four times a year in November,
    February, April, and August at test centers throughout the United States and
    abroad. Educational Testing Ser vice of Princeton, New Jersey, constructs,
    administers, and scores the examination for the Policy Committee of the Law
    School Ad mission Test relatively unnoticed and unat tended. However, it
    appears that Buck nell' students are not alone in their apparent apathy
    toward proms. Judging from an article in last Sunday's New York Times
    entitled Big College Prom is on the Decline, there is a coast to coast
    movement away from big proms. According to the Times, "It appears that every
    year there are fewer big proms and less in terest in those that are held."
    The article goes on to point out that at UCLA last year, for example, "At
    the Senior Prom there were 300 couples out of a class of 3,000." Also, at
    the University of Texas with an enrollment of 19,300 ". . . the class prom
    does not exist." Other examples in the article pointed out the same results
    and included several rea sons for the poor attendance at ! the affairs,
    which ranged from | lack of money to lack of class | consciousness to just I
    apathy toward proms. Last week at a meeting of the class presidents, the
    startling fact was revealed that this year's Senior Prom at Bucknell had in
    curred a loss of approximately $1800 which would have to be split among the
    four classes just as last year's $1100 loss was. This is, to say the least,
    quite an ex pensive affair for a mere 300 people.

Content: The Bucknell Artist Series will begin its season next year with a presentation
    of The Barber of Seville by the Goldovsky Grand Opera Company on Oct. 12.
    This will be followed, on Nov. 20 by the Berlin Philharmonic Orches tra,
    Richard Tucker, tenor, on Mar. 28, and Isaac Stern, violn- ist, on April 17.
    In making selections for the artist series, the committee con sidered what
    programs would be most successful in Davis Gym nasium. The Goldovsky Opera,
    the largest touring opera company in the United States, is consider ed
    especially adaptable to the gym because they will bring their own stage to
    set up right in the gym for the performance. The Berlin Philharmonic Or
    chestra, a large 110-120 piece or chestra under the direction of Karl Boehm,
    will present the Don Juan Overture by Strauss, Brahms Symphony Number 2 and
    Mozart's Fortieth Symphony. Richard Tucker is one of the foremost tenors at
    the New York Metropolitan Opera. Accordingly to Lindsey Merrill, chairman of
    the Artist Series committee, Isaac Stem is one, of the greatest violinists
    alive today, and one of the greatest all round violinists. In addition to
    his music, he is active in the Israeli program, is working to salvage
    Carnegie Hall, and is active in a program to exchange young ar tists among

    the mechanical or electrical equipment involved. Because of the enormous
    costs in j constructing and orbiting a space I satellite, the NASA is
    vitally in terested in obtaining as much in formation as ' possible from a

    John T. Webster, assistant professor of mathematics, and two undergrad uate
    assistants, William B. Le- Cates of York and Stanley G. Wheeler of
    Allenwood. One valuable and important piece of equipment Dr. Menden hall
    plans to use in conducting the study is the University's digi tal computer,
    a machine for mathematical calculations which hits proved to be a valuable
    aid not only for research and grad - 1 uate study but also for undergrad- j
    uate teaching in science and engi-j neering courses. At present, Bucknell is
    one of the few east ern universities offering courses on an undergraduate
    level in sta tistics and courses in which un dergraduates are given an oppor
    tunity to become familiar with the use and operation of the digi tal
    computor. Although this is the first time that a contract of this ,type has
    been awarded to a member of the Bucknell faculty, Dr. Mendenhall and Dr.
    Webster are frequently called upon by business and in dustrial firms in the
    area to solve industrial and .statistical prob lems. The two fields in which
    they specialize are design and an alysis of industrial experiments and
    design and analysis of life characteristics and reliability of industrial
    products.

Heading: A ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME
Content: As Commencement Day draws near, the question on everyone's lips is: "How did the
    different disciplines come to be marked by academic robes with hoods of
    different colors?" Everybody-- but everybody --is asking it. I mean I
    haven't been able to walk ten feet on any campus in America without somebody
    grabs my elbow and says, "How did the different disciplines come to be
    marked by academic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?" This, I must
    say, is not the usual question asked by collegianc who grab my elbow.
    Usually they say, "Hey, Shorty, got a Marlboro?" And this is right and
    proper. After all, are they not collegians, and, therefore, the nation's
    leaders in intelligence and discernment? And do not intelligence and
    discernment de mand the tastiest in tobacco flavor and smoking pleasure? And
    does not Marlboro deliver a flavor that is uniquely mellow, a selectrate
    filter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, a box that is hard? You
    know it! But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes. A
    doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears green, a master
    of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities wears crimson, a master of
    library science wears lemon yellow. Why? Why, for example, should a master
    of library science wear lemon yellow? Well sir, to answer this vexing
    question, we must go back to March 29, 1844. On that date the first.'public
    library in the United States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
    Sigafoos's neighbors were of course wildly grateful--all, that is, except
    Wrex Todhunter. Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both
    men had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had chosen Mr. Sigafoos
    because she was mad for dancing and Mr. Sigafoos knew all the latest steps,
    like the Missouri Compromise Mambo, the Shay's Rebellion Schottische, and
    the James K. Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all
    owing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans. (He was
    struck by a falling praline.) Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr.
    Sigafoos's library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library. This
    he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr. Sigafoos. "What has
    Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven't got?" Mr. Todhunter kept asking himself, and
    finally the answer came to him: books. So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library
    with lots of dandy books and soon he was doing more business than his hated
    rival. But Mn'Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
    serving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There upon, Mr.
    Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea with sugar. Thereupon, Mr.
    Sigafoos began serving tea with sugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter
    began serving tea with sugar and cream and lemon. This, of course, clinched
    the victory for Mr. Todhunter be cause he had the only lemon tree in town--
    in fact, in the entire state of North Dakota--and since that day lemon
    yellow has of course been the color on the academic robes of library
    science. (Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library and
    moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There were, to be
    sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but, alas, there was no cream
    because the cow was not introduced to California until 1931 by John Wayne.)

    Tonic on it. Most men use water with their hair tonic --  and 'Vaseline'
    Hair Tonic is specially made to use with water! The 100% pure grooming oil

    carried off victories. Singer's margin was 2-1, white the other four players
    swept 3-0 victories . The story was almost the same on Saturday, as the
    Bisons were incongenial hosts to Gettysburg, beating the visitors 15Vi-2Vi.
    All six BU golfers triumphed, with Etzweiler, Mull, and Sang win ning 3-0.
    Etzweiler played the course in 74 strokes. Last Friday * the Bucknellians

    the scene of the last event of the I year to be sponsored by the Sports Car
    Club of Bucknell. At i 2 p. m. a field of participants con sisting of both
    American and foreign cars will begin a two and one half hour race which will
    cover some of the most scenic spots surrounding the Bucknell j campus. The
    event will termin- j ate at the "Fence" drive-in res- taurant at about 5
    o'clock. At 7 j p. m. two films will be shown in i room A102 Coleman Hall to
    con-1 elude the events of the day. Everyone is again invited to at- 1 tend
    all events. t Previously, the first ralley w as, won by John O'Brian driving

    however by the 150 spec tators present for the little Isetta 300 challenged
    the larger cars with only 3% hp. If you are looking for a chal lenging and
    interesting way of spending Sunday afternoon, and if you enjoy the scenic
    beauty of Bucknell in the spring, then we will be looking forward to having
    you enter in this week's Ralley.

Heading: WITH CARE-
Content: May 2, 1961. A day to Remember. The much maligned, oft- berated, and undermanned
    track team SWEPT to victory in a triang ular meet. The once winless tennis
    team won its second straight, match. The dependable golf team crushed the
    opposition. In other words Bucknell went 3 for 3, batted a thousand, brought
    home all ! the bacon, all in one day. If a baseball game had been played and
    ! the Bisons emerged victorious, suspension of classes for a day would I be
    the only proper recognition. Actually, the teams are to be con- j gratulated
    for fine efforts on all three fields. Only weeks ago the outlook for
    victories, or victory, with the exception of the golf team, ! was one filled
    with doubt if not apprehension. Despite the "rotten" | weather, sunny days
    are here again. Power At The Plate The fact that the baseball team was
    leading Navy last Thursdayl 6-5 at the end of 7% innings was the result of
    four sluggers on the| now 0-5 outfit. Dreams of snapping the'"Middie's"
    12-game winning j streak were shattered by an eight run barrage in the
    bottom of the eighth frame, but not before Bucknell hitting amazed a Navy
    observ- er into remarking that the BU Bisons were one of the best teams the
    Annapolis nine had faced. Ash Ditka currently leads the "Murder-1 j er's
    Row" with a .389 average, including a double, a triple, and six! RBI's.
    Sophomore Sam Neisner is batting .368, including a pair of j | home runs
    against Albright. Ken Twiford has belted three circuit 1 clouts in notching
    a .353 average, collecting 16 total bases in 17 at | bats for a .941
    slugging percentage. Bart Richards has banged out ! three doubles among the
    hits listed in his .333 mark. Navy Extends Winning Streak Navy extended
    their streak to 13 by beating the Bisons, thus setting a new school mark.
    They have since upped the skien to 15 | wins in a row. Bucknell continues to
    outgoof the opposition, bobbling ! 29 chances against five for the "enemy" .
    They've whiffed exactly twice as much as the "other guys" also, going down
    on strikes 48 times in the five contests, as compared with 24 for opposing
    teams. Mike Kasnick, injured by a "Tony Kubek Hop" in the Lafayette game,
    should be in shape for one of the games in the double-header with Delaware
    tomorrow afternoon. "Kas" will be sorely needed on the mound as the Bisons
    lack the depth to go two full contests. If the baseball team gets good
    hitting from the sluggers and the defense holds up the squad could come
    home, 2-5. .. ...............................

    visits the Delaware j Blue Hens at Newark in a double- | header. Two seven
    inning con tests will' be played with the first I game getting under way at
    2 p. m. Mike Kasnick, returning to action after an eye injury which caused
    him to sit out for a week, and soph Dick Kiehn will have to shoulder most of
    the pitching load. Kiehn looked good last week against Navy until a flood of
    " Middie" runs chased him in the bottom of the eighth. Coach Rod Oberlin
    will field his squad in its next home contest next Tuesday against perennial
    rival Penn State. MAC Preparation The golf team warms up for Middle Atlantic
    competition this afternoon at the Bucknell course when it meets Georgetown
    Uni versity in a non-conference match. Bob Schad and Bob Etzweiler, the

    Walt Disney, and, since most people who go to the movies are-i under 21
    years of age, it is highly likely that Disney's films will al ways have an
    audience. More than 20 years since Snow While, Disney still leads the field
    of the animated form in their skill and production, but when one looks at
    the road from Fantasia to 101 Dalmatians was it really paved with the best
    of intentions? What has happened to the inventive ness, the charming humor,
    the beauty and the art of his films? The truth of the matter is that only in
    an occasional "true-life adventure," as in the recent Jungle Cat, is the old
    master's style present. Disney Declines This is not to say that the films
    Disney makes today are bad films i --anything but that. I thought ' that
    Pollyanna was one of the best films of 1960, if only for Hay- ley Mill's
    ingratiating perform- i ance, one of the finest I saw last Perhaps th# best
    comparison of j the new Disney to the old could be found with 101
    Dalmalions, Now this is admittedly a very well made feature length cartoon
    with an awareness for detail in which Disney's artists have reign ed supreme
    for years. 'Dalmalions' Disappoint But what begins as an amusing I'm afraid
    that the experimen tation, the willingness to take a chance on the public by
    present ing something different and excit ing, has just about disappeared
    from Disney's studio. Even one of his new ten-minute cartoons is sadly
    lacking in humor. And I don't think these are the ravings of a person who
    longs for the good old days of his childhood years. They are only the
    beliefs of someone who regrets the changing of a great and imagina tive
    artist to a highly professional entertainer who has so under standably
    capitalized on his unique fame.

Content: FRIDAY, MAY 12, 1961.

Heading: Giant Steps
Content: W ithin the past five years Bucknell U niversity has m ade trem endous strides
    forw ard both in academ ic stand ards and in im provem ent of its physical
    plant. Because o f this notew orthy progress, a Bucknell education be com es
    m ore valuable each year. The rise in  academ ic standards is largely a
    result of the quality of our faculty. The percentage of faculty m em bers w
    ith Ph. D. degrees has increased in recent years. W hile this alone does not
    insure m ore effective teaching, it docs guarantee better preparation.
    Bucknell does at- tem pt to hire individuals w ho are also persons, Dean K
    arl D. Hartzell states, " because learning is conditioned in  large part by
    the relationship and degree of involve m ent w hich develop betw een student
    and teacher. Our pupil-teacher ratio is presently about fourteen to one. O
    ver the past 10 years the proportion o f grades received b y  students has
    changed little, although in term s of C ol lege Entrance Exam ination Board
    scores and high school rank, the quality of incom ing classes has im proved
    sub stantially. This seem ing paradox can be explained by the rising
    expectations of the part of the faculty. Tne percentage of students
    attaining D ean's List grade point averages has also rem ained about the
    same, or possibly even dropped because of the elim ination of " QC courses .
    , T he faculty, generally, is reported to be pleased w ith the higher
    quality of students, and few er faculty m em bers each year choose to leave
    Bucknell. A nother m ajor area of academ ic im provem ent is the re cently
    initiated H onors Program . The U niversity H onors Program  includes three
    Colloquia in the arts and sciences, j Departm ental H onors Program s have
    been developed in Econom ics and Business Adm inistration, French, Germ an,
    H istory, Political Science, and Psychology. The already existing H onors
    Program  in English has been continued, and that in S ociology has been
    revam ped. These Depart m ental H onors Program s include special seminars,
    tutori als, and independent study. M ultiple-section courses have been
    established in m any departm ents as part of the com bined H onors Program
    s. Sabbatical leaves for faculty m em bers have been in creased by the Board
    of Trustees from  tw o to five per year. Increased amounts of m oney have
    been designated ; each year for sum m er research grants to faculty m em
    bers. These grants, w hich have m ore than doubled in num ber

Heading: I
Content: w ithin the past five years, serve as an index of faculty re search activity.
    The com plem entary part of B uckell's im provem ent plan , has served to
    enhance the value of our physical plant m ore than $5 m illion w ithin the
    past five years. Such m ajor additions to the cam pus as the Freas-Rooke
    pool, Colem an Hall, the addition to the O lin Science Building, the Adm
    inistrative wing o f the Vaughan Literature B uild ing and the new  w ing of
    Tustin Gym nasium  have all been com pleted since 1956. Renovations in this
    period include several m en's and w om en's residences, the Carnegie
    Building, Taylor Hall A nnex, and the proposed changes in first floor of M
    ain College (planned for this summer). A dditions and renovations, along
    with' the replacem ent j and enlargem ent of the stadium locker rooms,
    construe- i tion of enclosed firetowers on w om en's dorm itories, the j
    addition of a new  boiler in the B oiler Plant, and the in stallation o f
    air conditioning in the Bertrand Library rep- resent a five-year expenditure
    of about $4,530,000. E x penditures for academ ic equipm ent w ithin the
    last five years am ounted to about $250,000. The total value of the physical
    plant has increased from about $8,235,000 in 1956 to about $13,200,000. A t
    the same time, Bucknell's endow m ent has alm ost tripled. A s of June 30,
    1956, it totaled about $3,900,000; this year the total w ill reach approxim
    ately $11,090,000. A cadem ic and physical im provem ents here at Bucknell
    have been phenom enal w ithin. the last five years, and a reasonable balance
    has been m aintained betw een the tw o program s. The great strides in these
    respective areas have been due in large m easure to the efforts of Dean
    Hartzell and President M erle M. Odgers. W e are sure that the future of the
    University, in the hands of these tw o, w ill be assured for years to com e.

    weren't. Speaking of the Pershing Rifle Queens, have you noticed the in- j
    creased parking space behind Coleman Hall? They've been do ing a lot of
    constructing and des- tructing around here. They're fixing everything. I
    think that as soon as they get everything in top shape, they're going to
    blow up the place. And, speaking of blowing up things, what happens to the
    leaf blowers in the spring? I have a few more questions about local matters.
    (1) Why are the infirmary's pills pink? Why not blue or orange, etc.? (2)
    Where are the bull-dozers pushing the dirt to? (3) Where is Merle Od gers? *
    I wonder. I'd like to say a word about our baseball team. On second thought,
    I'd rather not be accused of being wordy. The word that I would use probably
    wouldn't get print ed, anyway. I will say a few words about Houseparty
    weekend. My mom called up and gave me some ad vice. She told me not to do
    any thing she wouldn't do. (That sounds funny coming from Mom). I don't
    think she knows that I could be flying to Miami this weekend with a girl.
    She'd fly to Miami with a girl. I better not say anything else about it.

    As some of you know, we'll be taking final exams in a few days. Don't you
    worry about a thing, They'll hit you so fast, you won't know what happened.
    I have spoken to the faculty, and it is agreed that it's best to just stay

    Russia now  has. Let us not be fooled by these puerile theories and opin
    ions. If our governm ent suppressed facts ip  regard to the progress of the
    space program , it would be inconsistent with our ideals as Americans.
    Communist Russia thrives on the obliteration of free expression of ideas.
    Her masses remain uninform ed and live in a cloak o f veiled evidences and
    prom ises of success. However, the om nipotent cen tral governm ent only
    allows its people to know  w hat it wants them  to know. Am erica was
    founded on the pre cepts of dem ocracy. As a dem ocracy, she must adhere to
    her inherent national integrity; her citizens are born  with a right to know
    her failures as w ell as her successes. Yes, w e could have concealed our
    failures in the space program -- and w e could have, perhaps, gained m ore
    inter national prestige with our achievements-- but the sup pression of
    these failures would have been directly con tradictory to our national
    integrity as expressed in the Bill of Rights! It remains for us to choose
    betw een the extra prestige accorded to us by other nations and sacri ficing
    a little of this extra prestige in order that w e may live honestly
    according to our constitution. D em ocracy is a magnificent philosophy, but
    there w ill be no dem ocracy for those w ho m erely support it, unless they
    take steps to protect it. N ow  is the tim e to pro tect it. N ow  is the
    time to protect our w ay of life. W e may have to sacrifice a little
    international prestige now. but w e w ill be insuring the future.

Heading: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Content: Dear Editor: The Delta Zeta Proposal pro-1 vides the sororities with an op
    portunity to evaluate their pur- j pose on Ihis campus. It seems to me that
    the main function of the sororities at Bucknell has become the rushing and
    pledging of new members. In recent years, soror ity membership has been on a
    de cline. The attitude of a number of actives has been one of indif ference
    and of many others an open expression that sororities are not necessary at
    Bucknell. These feelings have been pro gressing each year from seniors down
    to the underclassmen, and presently are permeating the thinking of many of
    the freshman pedges. How long can our sor orities continue to disregard
    these factors? As the University has been making great strides in the edu- [
    cational opportunities that it of-1 ! fers, what strides have the Pan- j
    Hellenic system taken to parallel these efforts? I understand that . . .
    "fratem - 1 ity undergraduate members stand I for good scholarship, for
    guarding of good health, for wholehearted cooperation with our college's
    ideals for student life, for the maintenance of fine standards, and for the
    serving . . of our col lege community." Does this state ment describe the
    sororities at Bucknell? The D Z proposal seems to pre sent the sororities
    with a chance to. utilize their time more con structively. By decreasing the
    emphasis on rushing activities, the sororities could enhance their purposes.
    The sororities could concern themselves to a greater degree toward realizing
    the ob jectives of Bucknell University. They could increase their import
    ance and provide more opportuni ties for their members to partici pate in
    the educational and cul tural activities on the campus. Sororities could
    work more posi tively in supporting student gov- ernment. Sororities could
    active ly improve the social competence of their members. These are only
    some areas that the sororities could realistically improve. Some groups seem
    to attempt some of these goals, but more effort is needed if sororities are
    to be meaningful at Bucknell. Some of the present activities of the sor
    orities need to be evaluated in relation to their purposes and the
    objectives of the University. I believe that sororities could make a more
    significant contribu tion to their members and to Bucknell if they are
    willing to examine themselves and take some constructive steps. The Delta
    Zeta proposal seems to pro vide a means toward this end. Sylvia Ohanesian,
    Asst. Dean of Women May 9, 1961 Dear Editor, On behalf of the Brothers of
    Theta Chi, I would like to take this opportunity to state the facts
    concerning the recent placing of my fraternity on social probation, and thus
    clear up the many false rumors circulating around the campus. Here are the
    facts: Friday morning after we had learned of the fire at the Sigma Phi
    Epsilon House, our president extended an invitation to the SPE's to have
    their annual Skid Row Party at our house the following day. We knew this
    party was one of their biggest of the year, and we felt that this would help
    raise their spirits and take their minds off the recent catastrophe. That
    morning, after Dean Meyn had heard about our invitation, he suggested to the
    SPE's that they not have the party. However, we were never told of this.
    Indirect ly, we had heard a rumor to this effect on Saturday morning, and as
    soon as we did, our president called Dean Meyn and asked if it were still
    permissible to continue (Continued on page 8) FRIDAY, MAY 12, 1961.

Heading: Concerning Academic Honesty
Content: Dr. Helmut R. Wagner, asso ciate professor of sociology, recently presented a
    paper on Student Community and Aca demic Honesty, at the Ohio Valley
    Sociological Society in Cleveland, Ohio. Basing his paper on results of last
    year's investigation into the problems of academic honesty, Dr. Wagner
    presented some of the conclusions reached with regard to the climate of
    academic moral ity which permeates the student body.. In contrast to
    convention al expectations, most students do not consider it their first and
    fore most obligation to devote them selves to their studies, and to up hold
    the demand of academic honesty as a moral principle re gardless of
    circumstances. This is due to a number of social (iri ; tests. These
    measures are de- \ signed to make it difficult to cheat but do not change
    the attitudes of i potential cheaters. Pragmatic Orientation # (6) The moral
    climate of the student body, thus, reveals itself | as a widespread
    "pragmatic" which would be damaging to the | orientation: honesty is for
    those members of the student body, rwho can afford or cannot circum no
    information to the "enemy" Mutual aid in examination, etc. is a
    manifestation of this solidarity as much as the expectation of cheaters to
    get unilateral "help" vent it. Dishonesty is called for when the
    circumstances warrant it; it is fully justified when in structors demand
    more from stu- from other students. Honest stu- dents than the informal
    "output dents, by and large, honor the norms" allow. In other words,
    principle of student solidarity in an originally moral obligation has that
    they refuse to report dis- been converted into a means of honest students
    even if they dis- operation within situations which approve of their
    behavior. are frequently defined as coercive, (4) Among the student body
    prevails a silent yet effective agreement on what constitutes a "fair-day's
    work" outside the classroom. The norms, at Buck nell, are low, but vary with

    factory where management-labor rela tions are strained. Cheating (5) Within

    more important than learning, or acquiring prac tically useful skills
    (engineering, business administration) as more meaningful than a liberal-

    addition, get thoroughly involved in the abun dant "social life" on campus:
    fra ternity and hall-group living, par ties, dances, dates, sports, etc. ab
    sorb most of their time and inter est. Consequently, the "academ ic life"
    appears to them as an im position, and frequently a matter of constraint:
    The administration insists on class attendance and a minimum grade-point
    average; | otherwise, "trouble" ensues; si multaneously, faculty members
    make it difficult to reach the mini mum standards. Thus, "learning" is
    turned from a common en deavor between students and teachers into a contest
    between antagonists. A good number of students feel that they must try to
    outwit their instructors in or der to defend their own way of campus life
    and their own inter ests. Solidarity (3) In this contest betwen students and
    faculty, solidarity among students becomes an im- potant moral principle. It
    is wide ly expected that individual stu dents do not become "chummy" with
    professors, that they cover up for others, that they convey and in which the
    representatives of the college system ought to be met with resistance and
    cun ning. Dr. Wagner wishes to add that this representation summarily gives
    a picture of tendencies ob served in the college more than one year ago.. He
    thinks that not all students succumbed to the prevailing climate of academic
    im morality. Likewise, he believes that changes are gradually taking place,
    and that, on the whole, the situation is improving. However, he is also
    convinced that the main pfoblem remains: the creation of different academic
    attitudes among the bulk of our students. This is a task which cannot be
    achieved without the active help i I and the support of all those stu- I
    dents who value the educational i opportunities offered them by the j .

Content: Beginning last summer and continuing through this year a Statistics Lab has been
    operating at Bucknell. Its major function is to provide statistical analysis
    and information for the Univer sity, its administration and facul ty.
    Supervising the project are professors William Mendenhall and John T.
    Webster, with Stan Wheeler and Bill Le Cates work ing on undergraduate
    assistant- ships. The calculations include devel oping a predictor or point
    estima tor of grade point averages. Based on the information on applica
    tions, it predicts for the end of the freshman year, first being used for
    the class of '65. This year it has been used as a part of the process to
    assist in the select ion of the class. With the Dean of Men, they have
    estimated the typical cost per year for the male freshman. Another of the
    projects is the evaluation of graduate area rec ord examinations beginning
    with the class of '61 and on. One of the current projects being under taken
    is designing a space experi ment. The Burrows C101 com puter is used in
    calculations. The Bucknell University De partment of Military Science was
    inspected by a team of Army of ficers headed by Col. Daniel M. Cheston last
    weekend. On Friday the inspecting team checked all the departmental records
    and classroom facilities as well as the supply and weapons rooms in the
    basement of the library. The re sults of this inspection proved that
    Bucknell rated far superior to any of the units which were j inspected in
    this area. On Saturday, the inspecting team reviewed the Corps of Cadets in
    the ceremony which is annualy held on Spring Festival Weekend. Once again,
    the ROTC j Department was given a superior 1 rating. The review got off to a
    spectac- j ular start when 1st Lieut. Richard j Grabow and Freshman Cadet
    Skipper Jacobs made a free-fall parachute jump from a plane fly ing over the

    my chiropractor, put the ocelot outside, and settle down for an evening of

    Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and let me quote for you the interesting
    tiding about all my old friends and classmates: Well, fellow alums, it
    certainly has been a wing-dinger of a year for all us old grads! Remember

    in Econ II? Well, they're married now and living in Clovis, New Mexico,
    where Harry rents spearfishing equipment and Mildred has just gjven birth to
    a lovely 28-pound daughter, her second in four months. Nice going, Mildred
    and Harry! Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likely to suc ceed?
    Well, old Jethro is still gathering laurels! Last week he was voted "
    Motorman of the Year" by his fellow workers in the Duluth streetcar system.
    " I owe it all to my brakeman," said Jethro in a characteristically modest
    acceptance speech. Same old Jethro t Probably the most glamorous time of all

    wife and white hunter. Tough luck, Francis! Wilma " Deadeye" Macomber, widow
    of the late beloved Francis Macomber, was married yesterday to Fred
    "Sureshot" Quimby, white hunter, in a simple double-ring ceremony in

    14-8 vie- | tory over the "white'* squad. Williams, who is the favored
    candidate for Paul Terhes vacated position, tossed a 10-yard pass to
    freshman John Thornton to give the "Blue's" victory. The "Blue" | team
    scored again when Matt i Hoet, a frosh from Lansdowne. Pa., ran 66 yards to
    a touchdown. The "White" eleven tallied when a center pass sailed- over
    Williams' head into the end zone and a charging lineman fell on the ball for
    a safety. Williams had at tempted to punt the "Blues" out | of a fourth down
    situation. Bob! Lipinski picked off a William's aerial and scooted 23 yards
    to | score the "White's" only tally. j Hart, a speedy halfback, picked up

    the team was spoiled when he lost in three sets at first singles. Jim won
    the first set 6-4, but he found his shots falling just long in the second
    and third sets as he lost 6-4, 6-3. Mike Nachwalter posted one of the' two
    Bucknell wins in singles as he won in straight sets. Frank Famariss was the
    other Bison to win as he defeated John Celeck, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 at sixth
    singles. Doug Herkner, Ted Altman, and Bob Heuman all lost their singles
    matches to make the score 4-2 with the doubles still to be played. At first
    doubles Jim Hand and Mike Nachwalter won easily to put the Peters' men
    within one match of the Nittany Lions. The third doubles team of Ted Altman

Heading: Too Short to Convey Meaning
Content: by Janet B. Creswick Nancy Owen's one-act play, All Fall Down, won the English
    department's play contest this year. All Fall Down, first pro duced on April
    29 by the Actors' Lab of Cap and Dagger, is a 15- mnute, high-tension,
    avant-garde comedy. The play, a well-wrought contrapuntal work, deals with
    three people living in three dif ferent worlds. The mother, Maude-Alice Mul-
    lin (Ellen Headley), is a self-con scious, well preserved and well ' girdled
    woman of about 40. She dusters. Person to person com munication occurs here
    for the first time in the play. This mo ment of understanding appears
    casual, when in fact, it is delib erately and securely grounded in the
    unusual common interest of both speakers in a common task. With the entrance
    of Hedy-Mae the play resumes its clever, quasi- realistic conversational
    levels, which are often parallel but never quite intersect. Hedy-Mae and her
    mother obviously do not see eye to eye on the dinner menu. Hedy-Mae
    concedes, and lima lives according to movie maga- beans mixed ,with
    pineapple zine diets prescribed by the Hoi lywood hierarchy. She is a pup
    pet of the printed word, a grace less caricature of glamour. Her husband,
    Henry Mullin (Chris topher Newton), lives in a 'world thoroughly hemmed in
    by the chunks triumph over separate side dishes and free will. This quibble
    is the springboard for a comic take-off on the origin of the name lima.
    Mother takes command of the situation and smugly recites the entire etymol-

    West. really is the man who holds up the world. The grotesquely danc ing
    Mullins join hands and shriek their shared derision at John West. He climbs
    upon the bench, with both hands still raised above his head, and finally,
    unable to convince them or escape them, he lowers his arms and allows the
    world to fall down on the Mullin family. Avant-Garde Effect Nancy Owen has
    not attempted to draw the characters fully in this play. She has instead
    creat ed two-dimensional people who exactly meet the character re quirements
    of All Fall Down. These flatly drawn characters are more vivid and less
    predictable than pure and simple types. Nancy uses normal family figures and
    situations with a great deal of hyperbolic skill. The postures and dialogue
    of the Mullin family are all calculated to dramatize the problem of speech
    without communication, in quasi-realistic terms. The total dramatic effect
    of the play is one of avant-garde shock based on humor and hys teria handled
    at an ever increas ing pitch. The crashing of the world at the end of the
    play is abrupt and surprising but not a 'deus ex machina'. This ending is
    well provided for by the in ternal dramatic hysteria of the play, and fuses
    many desperate characters and actions into a common conclusion. by Joel
    Flegler Hollywood finally outdid itself this time with The Alamo, which cost
    something like $12,000,000, took 14 years to make, and al most received this
    year's academy award for Best Movie. Now, 11 usually don't enjoy this type
    of spectacular,, but this one w as! really different. Space does not permit
    me to tell all, but I'll try to show what most impressed me. Depth of
    characterization was uniquely handled. There was that scene in the first
    hour--or was it the third--or the sixth? After a while, it was difficult to
    keep track. Anyways, our old friend David Crockett (we'll call him Davy from
    now on; everyone but Colonel "never smile" Travis did) had a feather fight
    (too com plex to explain here) with one of his men. This little piece of Ten
    nessee color made us know that Davy was a regular guy. Right before the
    historic battle took place, there was a scene in which one of the
    volunteers-- Jocko was his name--wanted to leave the about-to-be-sacrificed
    | church, but his blind and loving wife saved him from losing his honor by
    demanding that he re- Words are really useless in des cribing a movie of
    such magni- tude, but I can only say that by the end of this epic which

Content: by William Jacobsen Several years ago, before Cole man Hall was completed. Buck
    nell thespians were forced to stage their presentations in either the
    auditorium of the Lewisburg High School or in Bucknell HalL If a performance
    was not satisfac tory in those days, the hue and cry was that proper
    facilities for presenting 'good theater were not existant at Bucknell. Now
    that we enjoy the presence of a brand new, modem and theatrically per fect
    theater, what possible excuse can be given for presenting a play as poorly
    conceived, as' bad ly acted, and as boring as the re cent performance of The
    Male Animal, by Jamies Thurber and Elliot Nugent? Stock Comedy To begin
    with, the book itself is terrible, something I hadn't realized before I saw
    the play it- j self. The actors were forced to work with stock punch lines,
    out- j dated situation-type comedy and one ghastly cliche after another.
    People pulling doorknobs out of doors, characters who complain that their
    "teeth hurt" due to a hangover, and similar lines can be responded to at
    best by a very unsophisticated audience. Considering that it was Parent's
    Weekend, however, and consider ing the ultimate indifference of most of the
    parents to really good theater, perhaps there is some | explanation for the
    selection of I the play itself. The direction was another mat- j ter
    entirely, however. Characters j swallowed lines, interrupted each other, and
    most of the dialogue j seemed to occur while the actors j had their backs to
    the audience. Some actors (aud actresses) shout- ed and ranted their lines
    while others could barely be heard, due to poor timing of the audience's i
    laughter. The entire comedy was j played with as heavy a hand as j if the
    cast were doing Long Day's I Journey Into Night, and only a j very light,
    subtle approach could i have saved this outdated vehicle , from being
    completely awful. Casting Criterion The casting itself seemed sub- ject to
    criticism, if I might ven ture into this normally taboo area of reviewing.
    Alice Hooker, who played Mrs. Blanch Damon, was a joy to see and listeh to.
    Her subtle expression and character- ization was excellent, and she j never
    should have had such a small part. It is, my opinion that | she could have
    played Ellen Turn- j er (played by Linda Garrett) j much more successfully
    than Miss Garrett did. Marv Kahan, who played Tom- j my Turner, played the
    entire j play as if he knew exactly how bad the script was and could do
    nothing whatever to improve it with his acting. I understand that several
    other people tried out for this part and I seriously wonder I if someone
    else couldn't have been found who could have done a far better job. Mr.
    Kahan, is after all, not an actor--in any j | sense of the word, and it is
    my j !opinion that his friendship with; i John Wilson, the director of the I
    I play, may have had something t o ! j do with his selection for the part. I
    Greenburg Criticized The same thing applied to Les- 1 ter Greenburg, who
    played the j part of Edward Keller in the play. Mr. Greenburg shouted and
    rant ed his lines, bumbled and stumbl ed around stage and added abso lutely
    nothing to the already dull evening. Could his selection for the part have
    had anything to do with his friendship with Mr. Wil son, too? No, you
    insist? I think that certain coincidences in the !casting are too obvious to
    go un- | noticed, and I can't help suspect- ling that the answer is yes. If
    this is so, it's a pity, because jare had looked a bit farther than his
    roommates and fraternity broth ers and friends. Scenery Poor So much for the
    acting. senting a play should be a busi ness-like affair based upon talent I
    and ability, only, and not just upon friendship and fraternity
    relationships. Lo Grippo Praised Joseph Lo Grippo, who played the part of
    Joe Fergusson, was ' another matter. He, too, was a friend and fraternity
    brother of Mr. Wilson's (like so many other people in the play) but he, on
    the other hand, is talented and saved the performance from becoming a farce.
    Linda Garrett, who played El len Turner, was also poorly cast. Her acting
    almost looked like a parody of the "flutter-in-your- voiee" Soap Opera
    school of dra matic presentation and every thing she said on stage sounded
    memorized, staged, and contrived. Gay Pulley, another member of the clique
    that calls itself Cap & Dagger, was terribly funny as Cleota the maid and
    shows you | what can be done with even a | basically poor script. Michael
    Rorick, as Mike Barnes, was only !mediocre and so was everybody j (and
    everything) else about the | play except for Ron Carey, who did a decent
    interpretation of ! Dean Damon despite the corny j material he had to work
    with. ! The whole point here, in case I I've been too subtle, is that the I
    play looked like a mediocre high I school performance at best, and seemed to
    have been cast entirely i on the basis of friendship and ! availability
    rather than talent or I ability. I'm sure--or at least I I hope--that more
    capable and tal ented people for this play could have been found if Mr.
    Wilson ________ I _ _  H  M P I The make-up appeared non-existent; L that
    is, everybody in the play, despite their obviously silvered hair, looked
    around 20 years old. The lighting was fine, but the scenery resembled a
    waiting room in an impoverished charity clinic. Now I realize that this play
    takes place in the 30s, and I realize that English teachers (even those who
    can afford maids) generally can not afford to sumptiously furnish their
    domicile, but the set for The Male Animal still lacked any imagination,
    interest, or artistic value. Actors' Lab, without the bene fit of Cap &
    Dagger and in sev eral instances the University theater, has given several
    plays this year with new talent, good material, and performances which put
    The Male Animal to shame. Cap & Dagger--and the Univer sity Players--should,
    and must, wake up from their lethargy and quit taking college dramatics as
    just an amusement and an extra curricular activity for one or two
    fraternities and a few English majors. Role Repetition This play was not the
    only one in which the talent versus my roommate approach was taken. Cap &
    Dagger always seems to have the same people in the same roles in performance
    after per formance. Some of these people are good, others are not. All of
    them are devoted to the theater and probably have a sincere de sire to
    entertain Bucknell audi ences, but have they any talent? 1 Can they act? Cap
    & Dagger and the Univer sity Players (the same people plus music) have 2,000
    students from which to choose, so why can't they look for new people and new
    talent in their presentations? Why always the same fraternity and the same
    sorority and the same clique? I refuse to believe that these people are the
    only in terested or potential thespians on campus. On April 29 Actors' Lab
    gave a short but excellent one-act play written by a Bucknell student, Nancy
    Owen. Only two of the five leads had ever been on stage before, and one of
    these two was a professor, and yet the result was excellent

Content: by Mike Ingraham If someone were right in saying that Thurber should never at
    tempt anything over 20 minutes. The Male Animal is a testimonial. It lacks
    all the qualities of a good comedy (the qualities, by the way, that his
    short pieces in the Thurb er Carnival abound in), and sub stitutes instead
    some silly moral- j izing burdened with gummy sen- j timents that all but
    wreck the 1 play. Of course, this is the sort of script that experienced
    actors such as Henry Fonda pur posely pick in order to demon strate their
    exceptional talent and ingenuity, but when a group of amateurs handle it, it
    remains exactly what it is on paper-- trash! Brooks Atkinson wrote that he

    asked them to make all arrangements. Evident ly this is where a

    and 7, and the Alumni Weekend of June 2 and 3, no social events of any kind
    may be held by the fra ternity (Theta Chi) at its house or elsewhere.". As
    can be seen, this punishment only eliminated the Houseparty Weekend. A few
    days after this punish ment was imposed upon us, we were informed that the
    Social Committee was, in the interest of leniency, going to review the case.

    to have Parent's Weekend and Homecoming. Dean Meyn further stated, "I feel

Content: Classes end tomorrow and within two weeks finals will have finished, the class
    of 1961 will have commenced, and all Bucknellians will be pursuing summer
    employment, additional education, travel, and, of course, relaxation.
    Following this joyful summer interlude of "rest," the Bucknellians will
    return to the "friendly three hundred acres" to welcome the Class of 1965.
    These freshmen will naturally be looking to each and every one of you as the
    epitome of college! It therefore lies in your power to give them that
    wonderful--everlasting--impression of campus life! The present freshman
    class has evaluated the program of freshman hazing and has made several
    constructive changes in the procedure. The Freshman Week Program will extend
    from the first Wednesday of classes to the following Saturday. Within the
    four day period, hazing will be much more rigorous and will be more strictly
    en forced. Frosh men and women will wear the traditional signs and dinks and
    will be responsible for B. U. songs. In addition, the men will wear ties and
    unmatched socks; the women Will have to observe certain dress rules, such as
    wearing one knee sock and one bobbie sock and will not be allowed to wear
    any make-up during the program. Any frosh violators will have to perform
    before the soph omore class audience. Frosh are forbidden to cut across the
    grass and must be equipped with matches for the con venience of the
    upperclassmen. It is hoped that this new Freshman Week Program will be

Heading: The Bison Milker
Content: like to the re articles have received I had no idea when I was writing that
    fiyst article last summer that the response would be anything like it was. I
    hope you have found the articles inter esting and informative. I myself have
    certainly enjoyed writing them and look forward to con tinuing to do so next
    year if you wish it. I hope that through these articles I have been able to
    show there is less difference between "your world" and "my world" .
    -Certainly, there are differences between the two worlds, but there are also
    similarities. For those who responded to my request for readers at the begin
    ning of the year I wish to express a special thank you. I know there are
    still some who would have volunteered, but hearing that I had a full
    schedule were thereby unable to read to me. But, as you know, there have
    been seniors reading for me this semester and I'll be needing replacements.
    I am still amazed at the re sponse I did receive for my re quest for
    readers. This semester I have been able to go through both afternoon and
    evening every day with readers. For this I am grateful and can only say
    thank you. This semester I have had readers and work, but a lack of time. As
    I have indicated above, I will still be needing readers next year, and so I
    shall be so bold as to once again restate the request j made in the first
    article I wrote | If you have read this semester, and wish to read again
    next se mester, or if you have never read but would like to do so, I'll have
    | reading to do. In bringing this article to a close, may I once again
    express my ap- j preciation and gratitude for the response to both these
    articles and my request. May I wish to all an enjoyable summer vacation and
    to the seniors the best in what '] they will be doing in the future. Until
    next September, that will [ be all for now from "my world" . Sincerely, Dick
    Fidler tions is determined by a commit tee composed of one member ap pointed
    by Cap and Dagger, one member of Theta Alpha Phi, the faculty advisor, stage
    manager, production manager, and director. The director, who must make,
    ultimately, all decisions necessary in accordance with his interpre tation
    of the play, has a veto power. All people trying out for the play are
    automatically ineli gible for membership on this com mittee. 5. Actors' Lab
    productions are | supported financially by Cap and Dagger. The choice of
    play, di rection, and production, depend entirely on anyone with interest.
    The student or faculty member placing himself in charge may or may not
    present his idea to Cap and Dagger. Bucknell theater has been fortunate this
    year in having Mr. G. Grenville Cuyler here for pne year to direct and
    produce these plays. Actors' Lab was originally designed to pro mote student
    interest and give experience to those willing to work for a shorter period
    of time on shorter and less elaborate productions. It is unfortunate that
    student interest in drama at Bucknell has been so low as to make drafting
    necessary in all productions this year. ITiese productions include Cap and
    Dagger plays, the musi cal produced by University Play ers and the shorter
    plays given by Actors' Lab. The Male Animal had ten students trying out for
    13 roles. All were 'cast. The plays and directors have been chosen for next
    year. They are, in order, as follows: The Servant of Two Masters by Goldoni;
    Separate Tables by Rat- tigan; Mac Beth by Shakespeare; and Roadside by Linn
    Riggs. Anyone interested in any as pect of theater is most welcome.

    United States Steel Corporation Well, Houseparty Weekend is over. (Thai's
    not too profound, but, then again, if, I get too pro found nobody will read
    this. Look what happened to John Milton). I was talking about Houseparty . .
    . Kappa Sig had two fountains front of their house. When I was down there,
    everyone was getting thrown in. As a matter of fact, two of Kappa Sig's 600
    pledges didn't come up. Every one cheered. The SAE house was pretty quiet
    during the weekend. I saw SAE men at every house I went ! to. I gudss they
    enjoyed them selves. I guess the members of the# band enjoyed themselves,
    too. Fiji had a cool band from Washington. Everyone there was j ripping it
    up with the twist. The Merit Laundry probably forgot to starch their trench
    coats this week. The SAM's saw Roger Green off for Miami. In the true spirit
    of brotherhood, he suggested that the house save money by just get ting a
    single room at the Eden Roc Hotel. Everyone was glad to see him go, I want
    to thank the night watchman who lent me his suit and lunch whistle. I
    especially enjoyed my tour through Harris Hall during Houseparty. The girl?
    put on a wonderful show. But, that's not a nice thing to say about our Sem
    Gems, so I will add that they look so beautiful and collegiate when they sit
    on Bucknell's campus sunning them selves. It looks good, but the flys are
    terrible and there are ants all over the place. It's final exam time, so
    I'll leave you to your studies. Remember, exams are merely a means of ex
    pressing your cultural and techni cal achievements. (Don't believe a word of
    that. I only said it to impress any facujty members who may read this by
    mistake). Lit students, don't forget, that a QC course is a thing of beauty
    and a joy forever. Have a nice sum- i mer, anyway. Dear Editor, The reviews
    appearing in your I last issue written by Miss Cres- wick and Mr. Ingraham
    are to be commended. The lamentable use cf a misrepresentational few facts j
    appearing in Mr. Jacobson's ar ticle perhaps leaves something to be desired.
    Because University Players, Cap and Dagger, Actors' j Lab which is a branch
    of Cap and Dagger, and Theta Alpha Phi are student-run organizations, de
    pending for their existence on student support through partici pation, it
    seems necessary to clari fy certain facts of mechanical operation to the
    student body reading this newspaper. 1. All tryouts are open to all students
    and are publicized throughout the campus as well as in this newspaper. 2.
    Cap and Dagger membership is determined solely by the amount of work done in
    or on Cap and Dagger productions. Points are awarded on this basis, a
    minimum of 18 points being re quired for membership. 3. The plays,
    directors, produc tion managers, and designers are chosen by Theta Alpha
    Phi, the dramatic honorary, and are then submitted to Cap and Dagger for a
    final decision. Suggestions for these plays come from Cap and Dagger or any
    person outside of Cap and Dagger. A  list is posted for this purposes in the
    theater. The members of Theta Alpha Phi are again, chosen through active
    participation in Bucknell theater productions. The requirements are: A.
    Director of two (2) full -length plays. B. Major speaking characters in two
    (2) full length plays. C. Minor speaking characters in four (4) full length
    plays. D. Participation in two (2) one- act plays or author of two one- act
    plays shall be equivalent to participation in one full length play. 4.
    Casting for all major produc- Ediior's Note The comments by Miss Syl- l via
    Ohanesian, Assistant Dean \ of Women, concerning the Del- | ta Zeta Proposal
    for Sopho- ; more Rushing which appeared = in last week's 'Bucknellian' i
    were originally solicited as i part of a feature article. They j were not
    intended as a letter j to the editor. Dear Editor, For three and. one half
    years (minus a semester when he was studying abroad). Mr. William Jay
    Jacobsen, II, has set himself up as a self-appointed drama critic at
    Bucknell. His criticisms have not heretofore been attacked in any way--
    probably because he has not said anything worthy of refutation. So far, his
    criticisms, though meagre, have been for the most part satisfactory. Last
    week, however, you surprised me by publishing a supposed critical ar ticle
    by him on the recent produc tion of The Male Animal. This article skirted
    the field of criticism and remained complete ly submerged in the bog of mud-
    slinging. Mr. Jacobson's remarks were wholely subjective and ir relevant to
    an analysis of the production. Not only did he toss unfounded accusations at
    the di rector, Mr. John Wilson, and sev eral other members of the mast, whom
    he considers both over worked and overrated, but he also lavished praise on
    the production of Nancy Owen's one-act play. All Fall Down, for its cast of
    relatively unknown actors of which, of course, he was one. . Mr. Jacobson,
    in making this attack, aligns himself with a curi ous group of people at
    Bucknell who are unwilling to support cer tain artistic and creative
    attempts on this campus and, instead, try to defeat them by spurious as
    saults that are in no way related to constructive criticism. Mr. Jacobson's
    critical colors have finally come to the fore, and I sincerely hope that
    your editorial policies will prevent him from making any similar unwarranted
    attacks in the future. Mary Linn Grossman

    will include a selection of read ings suggested by faculty mem bers of
    various departments. The readings in each field will be roughly classified
    into two di visions: those for majors and those for non-majors. Thus, ma

    non-majors will be able to explore new fields in a broad<< and less

    They could never do such a cruel thing. Manly and muscular they may be, and
    gruff and curt and direct, but underneath they are men of great heart and
    sweet, com passionate disposition, and I wish to take this opportunity to
    state publicly that I will always have the highest regard for the makers of
    Marlboro Cigarettes, no matter how my lawsuit for back wages comes out. I am
    only having my little joke. I am not suing the makers of Marlboros for back
    wages. These honorable gentlemen have always paid me promptly and in full.
    To be sure, they have not paid me in cosh, but they have given me something
    far more precious. You would go far to find one so covered with tattoos as
    I. I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros have not covered
    me with tattoos. In fact, they have engraved no commercial advertising
    whatsoever on my person. My suit), of course, is another matter, but even
    here they have exercised taste and restraint. On the back of my suit, in
    unobtrusive neon, they have put this fetching little jingle: Are your taste
    buds out of kilterf Are you bored with smoking, neighbor? Then try that
    splendid Marlboro filter, Try that excellent Marlboro fleighbor! On the
    front of my suit, in muted phosphorus, are pictures of the members of the
    Marlboro board and their families. On my hat is a small cigarette girl
    crying, " Who'll buy my Marlboros?" I am only having my little joke. The
    makers of Marlboros have been perfect dolls to work for, and so, dear
    readers, have you. Your kind response to my nonsense has wanned this old
    thorax, and I trust you will not find me soggy if in this final column of
    the year, I express my sincere gratitude. Have a good summer. Stay healthy.
    Stay happy. Stay loose, O 1961 M m Bbali-- The makers of Marlboros and the

Heading: Kasnick's Eighth Inning Triple Decides
Content: The Bucknell baseball team combined a thrilling late inning scoring thrust with
    a fine pitching performance by Mike Kasnick to win its first game of the
    season over the University of Scranton by a 7-4 score on the BU field.
    Kasnick both pitched and bat ted the Bisons to victory. He struck out eight
    batters and al lowed only three bases on balls in going the distance for the
    first time by any Bucknell pitcher this season. He scattered nine hits along
    the route. Mike also col lected three hits himself and drove in four of his
    team's total of seven runs. The Bisons came to bat in the seventh trailing
    by a 4-0 score. Scranton scored two runs in the very first inning on a pair
    of back to back triples and an error. The visitors added another tally in
    the third on another triple and a run producing single. Their final run came
    across in the seventh as a result of an error, a single, a sacrifice, and a
    fielders' choice ground ball. After Ken Twiford opened the seventh by flying
    out deep to left field, Sam Neisner singled and Art Covey drew a walk. Both
    boys scored on Kasnick's single. Mike tallied the third run of the inning as
    Ash Ditka reached base safely on an error. The Bisons took the deciding
    advantage in the eighth inning when they scored three more runs, as the same
    boys provided the scoring punch. Gary Heck was safe on an error to open- the
    inning. After Twiford fanned, Neisner and Covey drew consecu tive bases on
    balls. Kasnick then | drove in the winning runs with a i long triple. Ditka
    singled home , Kasnick with the fourth run of i the inning. Kasnick fanned
    two I Scranton batters in the ninth | frame to help preserve his vic- ;
    tory. MIKE KASN ICK The Bisons experienced much ! less fortune last weekend
    as they ! dropped lopsided decisions to | Syracuse and Colgate University. !
    Buckrtell managed only four hits j last Friday against Syracuse, while in
    contrast the Orangemen | pounded the Bison hurlers for 21 runs on 24 hits.
    The story was just about the same on Saturday, as Colgate whipped the Orange
    and Blue, 9-0. Smith pitched a one-hitter for the Red Raiders,

Content: You're needed...just as your father and grand father were. It's an obligation
    that a lot of qualified college men have to meet...that of serving your coun
    try, when and where you are needed. And the Air Force needs college-trained
    men as officers. This is caused by the rapidly expanding tech nology that
    goes with hypersonic air and space flight. Your four years of college have
    equipped you to han dle complex jobs. You have the potential to profit from
    advanced training... then put it to work. There are several ways to become
    an officer. First there is Air Force ROTC. Another program, relatively new,
    is Officer Training School. Here the Air Force commissions certain college
    graduates, both men and women, after three months' training. The navigator
    training program enables you to win a flying rating and a commission. And,
    of course, there's the Air Force Academy. An Air Force officer's starting
    salary averages out to about what you could expect as a civilian. First
    there's your base pay. Then add on such things as tax-free rations and
    quarters allowances, free medical and dental care, retirement provision,
    perhaps flight pay, and 30 days' vacation per year. It comes to an
    attractive figure. One thing more. As an officer, you will become eligible
    for the Air Force Institute of Technology. While on active duty many
    officers will win graduate degrees at Air Force expense. Why not contact
    your local Air Force Recruiter. Or write to Officer Career Information,
    Dept. SCI5, Box 7608, Washington 4, D.C., if you want further information
    about the navigator training or Officer Training School programs. When
    you're old enough to go to college, you're old enough to go out with girls.
    When you're old enough to go out with girls, who needs college? Oh well,
    there's always Coke. FRIDAY, MAY 19, 1961.

Heading: TERHES NAMED TOP ATHLETE
Content: The Fourth Annual All-Sports Banquet on Tuesday night was a rewarding experience
    for the Bucknell athletes present. The reward came not from material
    tributes, or from the turkey dinner, or the eulogization of Bisons past and
    present, but rather from the words of a gray-haired, tanned individual by
    the name of "Rip" Engle. , Riding the Banquet Trail Rip Engle's football
    teams have vaulted Penn State and its coach to the dizzy heights of national
    recognition, and Mr. Engle's poise and fluency from the rostrum reflected
    something that could hardly be mistaken for anything but greatness. As the
    main speaker, and one who has obviously ridden the "Banquet Trail" many
    times, Rip warmed up his receptive audience with a few of the customary
    quips and jokes showing extraordinary polish. The Blue Ridge Bus Line The
    veteran (97-51-8-lifetime) coach told of his first days in college football
    when his team was beaten 108, 72, 60, and so on. He never gave his own
    squad's score because there.never was any. Hisi team rarely penetrated the
    ten yard line--their own ten yard line. Finally, because his team traveled
    so much and was on the road so often, a bus was bought, all the students
    loaded aboard, and the school was closed. It's now known as the Blue Ridge
    Bus Line. The Why of Football Since those mythical days, Rip Engle has come
    a' long way in football, but admitted that until the last two years no one.
    had asked him exactly WHY anyone should play football or participate in ath
    letics. The question was first asked him by the sponsors of a Euro pean
    clinic on the sport of football, as Engle and two other U. S. coaches
    prepared to teach the fundamentals of the game. The fact that Rip Engle was
    nationally known, had coached winning teams, or had been President of the
    American Football Coaches Association, or all his other credentials were
    nearly as important as his message Tuesday evening. Engle justified football
    and sports in general to his inquisitors by answering that the material
    rewards of athletics were insigifificant compared to "feeling" that one
    receives from sports alone. The feel ing of exhiliration in a hard fought
    win. The feeling of running a gauntlet of emotion, ranging from despair,
    frustration, and exhaust ion to pride, joy, and the indescribable inward
    satisfaction of triumph. The all important sense of accomplishment. Only
    sports provide a dynamic medium for this "feeling". Boys giving of
    themselves under strain and pressure, displaying courage, which Winston
    Churchill described as the "One quality that allows all others,"
    determination to win, and consequently knowing the intense gratification of
    successfully fighting for some goal, were the points of Engle's thesis on
    sports. The "Giving" of oneself, the sacrifices, the lessons learned, the
    friendships made, are all a part of the real rewards in sports. These few
    paragraphs give only a brief picture of Rip's philoso phy on athletics, but
    for those who attended, it was refreshing to hear not a speech blasting the
    "Play for Pay" athletic image in America today, but rather a tribute to
    those boys who seek and know the real reward of sports. It's something that
    can't be put on paper, stamped on the back of a medal, or measured in
    popularity. Every athlete, good and not-so-good, knows what it i s .
    ______________ Paul Terhes was named the outstanding athlete of the year i
    1960-61 at the All-Sports Banquet! Tuesday night by the athletic j
    department. The banquet, held ! in the Davis Gym annex drew a j crowd of
    about 250 of Bucknell's finest for a dinner in their honor.

    that exciting moment. "ROGER . . . .  GREEN" . With these two words, a huge

    you'll find the fastest relief for that tantalizing itch in your driving
    foot at your Chevrolet dealer's One-Stop Shopping Center. He's got cars that
    run the sport ing gamut like no others--nimble Corvair Monzas (2- or
    4-door), charged-up Impala Super Sports (in five different body styles) and
    the kingpin of produc- tion sports cars, the Corvette. You can take your
    choice without chasing all over town. They're all stablemates under the same

    as rare as a good musical produc tion is at Bucknell; I've never heard of
    either. Never, that is, until The Opera Workshop staged Mozart's Bastien and
    Bastienna. Mozart wrote it when he was 12 and lent it all the delightful, re
    freshing qualities of youth; sim plicity and gaiety. Bastienna, a lovesick
    young lady, is upset by the rumors that Bastien, her boyfriend, is out on I
    the town. She appeals to the , lovable old charlatan, Doctor i Colas, to
    recapture Bastien's heart I for her. Bastien is, of course, of the same mind
    and, after a typi cal lover's quarrel of vague threats and ingenuous
    insults, the reconciliation is completed in a little less than magical way.
    j Christopher Newton reworked I the libretto slightly to satisfy the !
    normal sexual bent of the college mind, but left the fine, light I humor
    besmirched. Everyone sang well! Judith I Townsend as Bastienna combined i a
    lovely voice with a perfect ease I and grace on the stage that has I not
    been surpassed at Bucknell (as long as I've been here). Any I forthcoming
    musical which does not feature Miss Townsend is out of its mind.

Content: The banana plant in the Botany Greenhouse is starting to flower! Flowers appear
    on the banana plant in the greenhouse about j every two years. The flower
    clus- | ter, now about six inches long, will continue to grow for perhaps
    six months, producing a new group of flowers every few days. The cluster
    will reach a length of probably three or four feet. The earliest flowers,
    toward the leaves at the top of the plant, will be pistillate, and will
    develop into fruit sometime in the fall. Ail of the later flowers will be
    stamin- ate, soon dropping off. The flowers themselves are quite in
    conspicuous, but each group of flowers is subtended by a promi nent colored
    "leaf," or bract. Stuart Sharp fit Bastien like a glove. He was by far the
    funni est person in the opera, and the most perfectly cast, since he is
    utterly and completely lost on the stage, and yet has the good sense and
    humor to know it. Christopher Newton was certain ly aware of it, and worked
