    every loyal Biuknelllan

Heading: who

Heading: game
Content: asserts that Bucknell outplayed Its heavier op- ponents. There are also those

Heading: who
Content: in- sist that the penalties imposed upon Bucknell by the referee were unjust. At
    any rate, it was a

Heading: game
Content: that

Heading: mado

Heading: men
Content: feel dubious about th*^ outcome until the final whistle had blown.

Heading: The
Content: 

Heading: game
Content: was In reality a punters duel, in which Captain Kostos had a slightly better
    advantage. The lin-^ plunging of Bow.<<er, and the hard woric of McDermott
    at end featured the name from the Bucknell stand- point, although every

Heading: man
Content: on the team played such a steady, consistent

Heading: game
Content: that it is hardly fair to mention any particular

Heading: man
Content: as an indivldul star. The Orange and Blue line held like a -tone wall, and

Heading: made
Content: the cele- brated Helsman shift look like the

Heading: German
Content: line in the Argonne. Our backfield was a steady grovind gain- er, and matched
    Penn In the totals of first downs. Taken as a whole, our team was equal in
    every respect to the Red and Blue eleven, and only the breaks of the

Heading: game
Content: 

Heading: made
Content: the scon- what it was. Dncknell lost two good chances of scoilng by unfortunate

    holdirig were the only things which kept the Orange and Blue from crossing
    the Penn line. On the other hand, Penn received very slight penalties for
    holding and off- side play, and received all of the breaks of the game. The
    story of

    whistle blew. The battle reminded one of two famed gladiators

Heading: who
Content: weie very, very nuich afraid of each other. Both Penn ani Bucknell fear- ed the
    other's strength and kept with in ;-ale bounds during the entire time. Only
    twice did both clubs essay the forward pass. The Red and Blue at- tempted It
    In the opening period

    of the team and of the student body. The cheering threatened to tear off the

    would have completed the destruc- tion. I'opular songs were roared out from
    lusty throats in the early part of the meeting. "Ray, Bucknell" and

Content: for the success of Bucknell, u- thletics this year, it is development or
    organized and effective cheering. Coaches and players will testify to the
    fact that the vocal and spiritual support of a well trained and well led
    cheering section is an Important factor in the winning of games. Bucknell,
    long noted for her spirit and for the cheering ability of her student body,
    has been lax in main- taining this reputation in the past few years. This,
    like

Heading: many
Content: other de- fects,

Heading: may
Content: be blamed partly upon the effects of war, but not entirely .so. Both cheering
    staffs and student body have*been apathetic in their support of Buckneli's
    teams. The ex- perience of the past year has proven that the substitution of
    individual witticisms for organized support is a failure. It Is the duty
    this year of the cheer leader and his asj^Lstants to develop and maintain a
    cheering body that is well trained and enthusiastic. This is not an easy
    task, but it is a neces- .sary one. and it merits the support of every loyal
    Bucknellian. It is a task which must be begun soon and con- tinued thruout
    the entire year. It is a task that coaches, players and alum ni

Heading: SPIRIT
Content: The Following article written by "Bobby Waddell, '20, and published Ina
    Pittsburg paper expresses to

Heading: my
Content: mind the

Heading: new
Content: spirit of Bucknell , "Bucknell is no longer a trial horse for the big colleges.

Heading: We
Content: have a big team this year, and we are startiiii^ to grow.

Heading: We
Content: had more students than

Heading: we
Content: could handle

Heading: when
Content: college opened in September.

Heading: Many
Content: extra acres of land have been acquired lately upon which to build. Athletics at
    Bucknell have been carried along just so-so, b\it there Is a revival on and
    it won't be long until

Heading: we
Content: will be up with the loaders.

Heading: Vou
Content: 

Heading: know
Content: it doesn't tak.^ long to get to the top these days."

Heading: BOOST
Content: Tliere are a certain few wet blankets in every institution In th" country
    whether that instituticMi Ix prison, asylum, hospital or school and in
    Bucknell

Heading: we
Content: have our few

Heading: who
Content: have long since adopted the

Heading: common,
Content: ordinary

Heading: hammer
Content: as their mainstay of equipemnt. These few fellow beings refuse to turn the
    doud.s inside out. They seem to feel that the only difference between school
    and jail if tliat in jail you have hopes of shortening you'- sentence while
    in school you

Heading: work
Content: only for clemency. They hover over every bit of sunshine ready to swoop

Heading: down
Content: and destroy it like a bunch of hawks. Thoy set up a wail at every opportunity,
    equal to that of the hound dog in Huckleberry Finn,

Heading: wh
Content: .sat and howled at the

Heading: moon
Content: becau.sH it was bright. These fellows accomplish nothing,

Heading: amount
Content: to nothing, are are wortli nothing minus to the school and to their fellow
    students.

Heading: The
Content: hamni'r is a great instrument for driving nails but a poor one for driving a-
    head. Con<<tr"'tive cirticl'^m has ac- complished wonders, l)ut destructive
    criticism has never accomplished any thing. Let's get together and learn to
    take things as they come. Forget about the thorns on the roses, think only
    of the fragrance of the blossom. If things are going

Heading: wrong
Content: don't sob. but get out and change them. Be alive and smile a bit and strive to

Heading: make
Content: your surroundings the brighter for your pre.-ence. Remember, an optimist i.--- a
    person

Heading: who
Content: sees a light where there isn't any and a pessimist la a person

Heading: who
Content: blows it out. so look about you and see the lights of opportunity and then cast
    aside your

Heading: hammer
Content: to lend your ef- forts toward a better Bucknell. *21

Heading: The

Heading: when
Content: 

Heading: we
Content: came back to Buclcnell from far and near

Heading: we
Content: all turned out to football scrimmage, the

Heading: team
Content: looked promisiug, hopes ran high. Coach Reynolds

Heading: was
Content: given ;t

Heading: welcome
Content: which all but took

Heading: him
Content: off his I'eet. Rou.-iing mass meetings placed the whole student body bchir.il
    their team. But

Heading: now
Content: that the sea- son is over, as the smoke beglnp to Clear from the field of battle

Heading: we
Content: can look back to see

Heading: what
Content: 

Heading: we
Content: have ac- complished. In spite of the fact that we were disappointed in our high
    hopes of "beating Penn," in spile of the fact that our three great games
    were "al- mcstp." what is there in this year-; record which makes every
    Bucknell- ian proud of his football team'.'

Heading: The
Content: fact that our total of scores

Heading: amounts
Content: to 244 as against 37 for our opi>' i:i^nts and the fact that no team scored more
    than one touch

Heading: down
Content: on Us (luring the season .speaks for the consistent playing of the Orange and
    Blue eleven.

Heading: The
Content: fact that at the back of our line-up stands a

Heading: man
Content: 

Heading: who
Content: holds the second highest individual score in this years football records of
    America strikees a note of response In the heart of every Bucknellian.

Heading: And
Content: the fact that every player re- Bpects his coach and every student Ib proud of
    his team nuikes Bucknell fofttball a imit to be reckoned with.

Heading: Back
Content: of our whole football organ- ization stands "Pete" Reynolds, th' greatest coach
    Bucknell has ever

Heading: known.
Content: 

Heading: A
Content: driver and a master he

Heading: com
Content: 

Heading: mands
Content: the respect rather thati the familiarity of hi^ men.

Heading: The
Content: spirit with which his .equad does tho.se "lour laps around the track and un- der
    the cold .'-howers" after three hours of steady diill is the greatest
    tribute possible to his ability. His arrival in Lewisburg this fall, riding
    with President Hunt, in a cab

Heading: drawn
Content: 

Heading: by
Content: a njob of willing students, was an Index of his place in the heart of Bucknell.

Heading: Behnd
Content: 

Heading: him
Content: have stood a host of loyal supporters, all responsible for the success of the
    .-reason. Graduato- Eianager Glass Kas filled his office honorably and well.
    Only those

Heading: who
Content: have dealt with "Art" Harris as stu- dent comptroller

Heading: know
Content: what praise he deserves.

Heading: And
Content: "Bill" Willman as manager- well, suffice it to say that Bill has

Heading: managed
Content: as only the 'Kal.ser' himself could. Last but not least in the iiiachine.

Heading: we
Content: 

Heading: may
Content: mention Cap- taia ''Joe" KostoH

Heading: who

Heading: And

Heading: Xmas
Content: vaca- tion

Heading: was
Content: of three weeks duration. School floi-cd on or about the 17th of December, and
    opened about Janu- ary (J. This year it is closing the 22. and opening
    .January Gth, or nearly one week later. I wonder

Heading: why
Content: vaca- tion is so arranged tills year? The other colleges and larger high schools
    of the east close Wednesday December 15. or not later than the 17th.

Heading: Why
Content: can't Bucknell do the same and fall in line? In the negative

Heading: we
Content: are told: Bucknell must have a certain number of days upon which

Heading: we
Content: sliall hold classes to maintain her high standard. The wiiter

Heading: knows
Content: that otlier colleges open later in in the fall, have a vacation Just as long as
    our

Heading: own
Content: at Xnuii. and still dismiss at an earlier date in the spring. How- do they do
    It?

Heading: Do
Content: other colleges fall below the standard? Dec. 21, has been proclaimed a na-
    tional holiday, as the 300th anni- versary of 'the landing of our Pilgrim
    Fathcr.s. Will classe.4 be held upon that date? If classses are not held
    should cla.s.ses be resumed upon Tues- day and

Heading: Wedneday
Content: following? If doesn't seem right. Students,

Heading: why
Content: not talk it

Heading: An
Content: impression prevails that th,' teacher shortage throughout tli.- United States is
    no longer a serious problem. Recent reports received from county and
    district .superinten- dents in every State clearly indicate that such a
    conclu.'^ion is erroneous. While the average condition is slight- ly better
    than last year, due to markt improvement in States where salari^/s have been
    greatly increaat. the gen- oral situation hemain'^ practically un- clianged.
    The numl)er of .schools with out teachers and the still larger num- ber
    tatight by incompetent teachers sho wthat a very serious situation still
    exists, particularly in those States where salaries are lowest.

    the replies re- ceived to thiee of the (juestions asked ( 1 ) The number of
    teaching posi- tions in the country or district cov- ered by the report; (2)
    the shortage of teachers at the opening of school in September, 1920; (3)

    night aot Selinsgrove, 24- 14. The

Content: for the calling of fouls on Susf4Ui- lianna, which to anyone knowinr, 'he game,
    were well deserved. ~'I'!ie pliiylug of the BuckueJl team was a great

    three licld g 'als and Julian and Bihl each one. Biiil made 1! oMt of 28
    fouls. Rogowi^*^ for Susquehanna, had three field .-joals and Sweeney had
    two. The first half was very close, bein.g nip uiul tuck throughout.
    Buci(neirs lirst live points were scored on fouls, S tsquehanna's on two

    fouling and Bihl continued mak- ing hall his tries. Both teani.-i nad better
    luck in locating th" basket, Bucknell ring'ng 4 goals from field. and
    Susquehanna ringing 1. Rihi's basket was one of the prettiest of tho ganiH.

Content: On last

Heading: Wednesday
Content: afternoon the Bucknell

Heading: Lyceum
Content: held a very Inter- esting meeting at which about .seventy students were present.
    The program was one of an entire social nature and an atmosphere of real fun
    prevailed. It is seldom that the stu- dents get an opportunity to get to-
    gether outside of their respective groups and it was an opportunity that all

Heading: who
Content: took advantage of thor- oughly enjoyed. The presentation of "The Three Bears"
    was given with *Tiny" Ha.^en as the "little

Heading: wee
Content: bear,"

Heading: We
Content: can all imagine "Tiny" as the little bear and with her voice to match it
    certainly was a .scream. Laughter flowed free- ly during this number.
    "Curly" Lawson then rendered .several ditties accompanying himself on the
    banjo. They were very well given and ap- preciated by all. "Tiny" Hasen

Heading: was
Content: again featured in a

Heading: mock
Content: opera scene from

Heading: Romeo
Content: and Juliet. "Tiny" had to keep up her established reputation and she certainly
    did. The crowd was then divided In half in a contest to see which sides
    could think of the most slang expressions in ten min- utes.

Heading: The
Content: king's English

Heading: was
Content: mur- dered. One side thought of about eighty ann the other about fifty. Anything
    from

Heading: "Where
Content: do you get that stuff," to "Stand back, you'll get your money," was used. Sue
    Post then gave a reading entitled "The Courtier." It wius v.ell acted out
    and showed marked ability. The after- noon closed with the Hinging of sev-
    eral popular airs and was one of real fun. The next meeting will be held
    thi.s Wednesday afternoon

Heading: when
Content: an after- mjon will be spent with Rudyard i\ipllng. The whole school is invited
    and it is hoped that a large

Heading: May
Content: Peterson, the first of the art- ists presented in the course by

Heading: Mu
Content: Phi Epsilon, delighted and captivated a very large audience last Friday ev-
    ening at the Bapti-st church. The soprano has made herself

Heading: known
Content: as one of the most gracious and winsome of the younger singers befort' the
    public, both in concert and at the Metropolitan. Her voice Is beyond
    reproach in warmth, beauty and technique, and is always on pitch, a virtue
    of tew singers. Style, irreproachable taste and finish, combined with great

Heading: mu-
Content: sicianship, impart to every phase of her

Heading: work
Content: a delicate distinction and great artistry. One of the charming things about her
    concert was the description she gave before her songs. It seemed to bring
    her audience closer and gave them a moie personal feeling towards the
    singer. Credit Is certainly due Stuart Roi^s for his finished
    accompaniaments. It is hoped that MLss Peterson will return for another
    engasement. The varsity basketball team

Content: The team displayed its poorest brand of basketball in this game, be- ing unable

    Our team played ragged ball the first half, scoring but 4 points, on lield

    Student Ex. president. Nominations for the executive board iiad been made,
    as was tho custom, by llie nominating board, composed of the various class
    pre<<i- dent.H and the president and vico- presldent of Student Government.
    All was set for the election of

Heading: when
Content: to the surprise of many, and to the astoni,shment of the present "student exes."
    a motion was

Heading: made
Content: to re-elect the present board. After .some discussion, which

Heading: was
Content: mostly "pro" it was decided that the girls

    two terms is an en- tirely

Heading: new
Content: one, having never been done since Student Government ha;^ existed at Bucknell.
    Therefore, this would show that the present "student exes" are indeed
    popular ones and should be highly complimented by the honor which the

Content: 15. The single feature whlrh disin; guished the recent ten-day trip of (h'
    Bucknell Olee Club from all oth' i trips, was the

Heading: manner
Content: in which Mic

Heading: men
Content: put across the series of concerts in the absence of I'rof. Paul Stolz, the
    director of the dub,

Heading: who
Content: was unable to accompany the

Heading: men
Content: on the trip. Fired with their usual entluis- iasni, the men, under the able
    leader ship of Ilulph Hartz,

Heading: manager
Content: of the club, staged ten successful concerts in nine towns in the northern coun-
    ties of the state. Manager Hartz, in ' the absense of the regular director,
    assumed that position, and filled both it and his

Heading: own
Content: place as soloi.st and tenor in the quartette in a highly 1 satisfactory nianner_

Heading: Much
Content: credit is I due every

Heading: man
Content: 

Heading: who
Content: made the trip, I and especially to Manager Hartz for his part for the

Heading: way
Content: In which they | [entered into the work. It was the' I first time in Glee Club
    history at I Uucknell that the club has opened, on a tour without a nieniber
    of the faculty accompanying them. I The factors contributing most I greatly
    to the success of the concerts were the cooperation shown by the

Heading: men
Content: and the spirit of responsibility oxhiliited. Each one seemed to real- ize that
    it was up to him to do his utmost to

Heading: make
Content: things run smoothly in the ab.sence of Prof. Stolz. and that he must at all
    times enter into the work at hand with a will. The morale of the

Heading: men
Content: was also excellent, for, while the trip was be.set with difficultie.<<, such as
    poor traveling ac- commodations, getting up early to

Heading: make
Content: train connections and .so on, there was not a

Heading: murmur
Content: of discon- tent. Their being well-fed at all times doubtless had a great deal
    t(i 'do with keeping up the morale. I That the concerts were successful lis
    given added proof of a different ! nature when the letters of apprecia- tion
    which have been received by tln' manager arc taken into considera I tion.
    Letters of praise have been received from various towns, and 1 praise is
    both for the excellence of 'the concert work and for the excel- lence Qf
    behavior on the part of the men.

Heading: Many
Content: return concert dates for next year were booked as a result of the trip. At Port
    Allegany, the

Heading: members
Content: of the club took entire charge of th'^ Sunday evening union services, in the
    Methodist church, after which a sacred concert was given. Another feature of
    the

Heading: work
Content: of the club, which is carried out on every trip, was the securing of name-i of
    prospective students for Bucknell. The club is one of the best adverti-<-
    ing mediums at the disposal of th>^ University, as it Is ever talking up the
    University and urging h'gh school students to come here.

Heading: The
Content: club did not fail in this depa'tniont of its work on the recent trip. In fact,
    taken all in all, the recent trip was

Heading: among
Content: the most successful ui the history of the organization.

    Formerly meetings were spread out from

Heading: Monday

    inconvenient, due to the fact that whenever a lec- ture,

Heading: game
Content: or something of the sort was held, one sorority was at a dis- advantage. The
    idea of sorority meetings all on Tuesday evenings is doubtless a good one
    and will prove advantageous to the co-eds as well as the school in general.

Content: (Printed by Request of the

Heading: U.
Content: S. Treasury Department.)

Heading: The
Content: economic necesRitles of Amer- ica and the need for safeguarding the financial
    independence and safety of each individual citizen has deter- mined the
    Treasury Department to continue the issue of Government Savings Securities
    throughout 1921. according to an announcement by Secretary of the Treasury
    Houston. Those necessities, widely recog- nized

Heading: among
Content: college

Heading: men
Content: have also committed the Treasury to contin- uance and Intensification of the
    work of the Savings Division of the Trean- ury In a broad campaign to

Heading: make
Content: saving, and safe Investment, a na- tional habit.

Heading: The
Content: savings securities of the gov- ernment, familiar in every house- hold, will be
    augumented In 1921 by two

Heading: new
Content: Issues, a $1 Savings

Heading: Stamp
Content: and a |25 registered Treasury Savings Certificate. In announcing the issue of
    these securities. Secre- tary Houston says:

Heading: "Two
Content: 

Heading: new
Content: Treasury savings .se- curities will be Issued during the somlng year, a $1
    Trea.sury Savings

Heading: Stamp
Content: and a $2 5 Treasury Savings Certificate. The |1 stamp will be non-interest
    bearing, will be bright red In color, imprinted on a green tint, and will
    bear the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first Secre- tary of the
    Treasury. The |25 cer- tificate will be similar In design and terms to the
    |100 and $1,000 Treas- ury Savings Cetrlficates, which will also be offered
    In 1021, to mature January 1, 1926. "The

Heading: new
Content: securities will supply a $1 unit for saving and a registered Government security
    In the |25 de- nomination, which can be conven- iently purchased through the
    accu- mulation of the $1 Treasury Savings Stamps. More Important still, the

Heading: new
Content: securities will complete a most attractive line of Government sav- ings
    securities, the $1 stamp and the $25, $100 and $1,000 registered Treasury
    Savings Certificates, and thus place the Treasury Savings

Heading: movement
Content: on a solid peace-time ba.sls.

Heading: The
Content: small denomination war- time securities, the $5

Heading: War
Content: Savings Stamp, in a 1921 series, and the 25- cent Thrift Stamp, will also be of-
    fered during the coming year. "Notwithstanding the reaction since the
    arml.stlce from habits of saving, and the natural tendency during the past
    year to Invest funds In Liberty bonds and Victory notes at current market
    prices, the

Heading: demand
Content: for the savings securities has contin- ued strong in

Heading: many
Content: parts of the country. As the security markets become more settled. Treasury Sav-
    ings securities, bearing interest at 4 per cent compounded quarterly, ex-
    empt from State and local taxes and from the normal Federal income tax, and
    redeemable substantially on de- mand, .should prove Increasingly at-
    tractive to the multitude of small investors. With these considerations; In
    mind, the Treasury Is committed to the continued sale of Government sav-
    ings securities,

Heading: and
Content: feels that as time goes on continuous sales of savings securities over the
    counter, at pot- offices and banks throughout the country, should play an
    increasingly important part in the current finan- cing of the Government.
    "To this end, the Treasury Is also committed to the continuance of the

Heading: work
Content: of the Savings Division, In Washington and in the several Fed- eral Reserve
    districts. This organ- ization endeavors to promote the popular purchase of
    Government Savings Securities; develops and pro- tects the secondary market

    .securities. It.s work along these lines will be Inten- sined in 19::i. 'The
    Treasury Savings

Heading: Movement
Content: has already demonstrated its useful- ness by its efforts to promote sound
    economic conditions throughout the j country and disseminate sound econ-
    omic doctrine. In fact, the work of the .Savings Divl.sion thi.<< year, not
    only in promoting the sale of Gov- ernment Savings Securities and in
    strengthlng the secondary market for Liberty bonds, but in establishing
    wide-spread habits of thrift and suv Ing, has been frequently recognized as
    meeting a great national need. That recognition has been strikingly
    emphasized by the requests of great national organizations that the sav-
    ings work be continued and by their offers of active cooperation In the
    movement. "The work of the Savings Division has been splendidly successful
    In the .schools, with the children as well as with the leaders of
    educational thought In America. As a result, th<! committee of State
    Superintendents of public Instruction, which has just met in Washington, has
    decided to urge every State Superintendent and Commissioner of Education to
    Install thrift courses in every school and at the same time provide for the
    prac- tice of the principles taught by of- fering means for sound
    investment. "In responding to these demands the Savings Division will
    intensify during 1921 its campaign to spread broadcast the essential facts
    relative to wise savings and spending and in- vestment and the continued
    develop- ment of

Content: to "mid-year's."

Heading: How-

Heading: Monday

Heading: The
Content: Beta

Heading: Kappa
Content: Psl team entered into their second

Heading: game
Content: of the season with unlooked-for ability and

Heading: won
Content: from the Non-Frats.

Heading: The
Content: contest

Heading: was
Content: full of surprises, the biggest be- ing the score, which was 18-22. Lonrr and
    Mussina brothers connected with the basket frequently enough to off- set the
    good work of Treadwell and Miller for the Non-Frats. Under the capable lead
    of Buck- nell's bandmaster the

    activity in Tuatln

Heading: gym
Content: during the week of February 1. Seven games of basket- ball were played in the
    Inter-frater- nlty league and some of them proved interesting. Phi

Heading: Kappa
Content: Psi played three

Heading: games
Content: during the week without a defeat and were still able to retain the honor of a
    clean slate.

Heading: They
Content: have plenty of material, have been playing a hard and fast

Heading: game
Content: and are bidding strongliy for the handsome cup that will be donated to the win-
    ning team. The Non-Fraternity team also has a mighty fast aggregation,
    having suffered but one defeat In tho hands of Beta

Heading: Kappa
Content: Psl.

Heading: Much
Content: de- pends on the results of the

Heading: game
Content: be- tween these two teams.

Heading: The
Content: S. A. E. team, which began the sea-son by a series of victories, stands next in
    the list, but has recently suffered two defeats.

Heading: On
Content: 

Heading: Wednesday
Content: night the first

Heading: game
Content: was between the Beta

Heading: Kappa
Content: Psi team and the Phi

Heading: G^mma
Content: Delta team.

Heading: The
Content: Beta Psl team carried off the bacon with a one-point lead.

Heading: The
Content: Phi Ganiri took the lead, .scoring ten points before the Beta Psl team got under
    way.

Heading: M.
Content: Mussina missed Ave tries at fouls and then

Heading: Long
Content: began to do the foul shooting for that team.

Heading: The
Content: Beta Psl team took a spurt but were unable to catch the Phi

Heading: Gam
Content: team before the end of the first half, which ended with a 16-12 score.

Heading: The
Content: Beta Psl team started the second half of the

Heading: game
Content: with a rush and soon tied the score at 18.

Heading: The
Content: 

Heading: game
Content: from there on was very exciting with first one team and then the other in the
    lead.

Heading: The
Content: 

Heading: game
Content: ended in a 24-23 score with the Beta

Heading: Kappa
Content: Psl team In the lead. Defflbaugh and Purnell played a fine

Heading: game
Content: for the Phi Gam.s aud did uiost of their scoring nefl- baugh shot 7 out of 10
    foul goals.

Heading: Long
Content: and the two Mussina boys played a crack

Heading: game
Content: for the Beta

Heading: Kappa
Content: Psi team. They were,

Heading: how-
Content: ever,

Heading: weak
Content: on foul shooting, caging only 6 out of 17 foule.

Heading: The
Content: second

Heading: game
Content: was of a milder nature between the Slgs and the Delta Slgmas. The Slgs kept the
    scoring pretty

Heading: much
Content: to themselves, winning by 21-8. The Slgs appeared in

Heading: new
Content: uniforms and Treadwell took over the refereeing Job. Woodrln;? played an all-
    round

Heading: game
Content: for the Slgs and contributed largely to their victory.

Heading: The
Content: Slgs scored 13 points before the Denils were permitted to score. Rosa threw a
    foul just before the whistle announced the end of the first half. At times
    the

Heading: game
Content: tended to be a little rough. Tlngley caged 2 field goals and Rose shot 1 out of
    3 fouls and Walk- er shot 3 out of 9 fouls for the Delta Sigma team. Jones
    and

Heading: Woodrlng
Content: played a fln(c)^ all-round

Heading: The

    half saw Coach Glass'

Heading: men
Content: guarding closer and consistently breaking up thoir opponents' short pas.ses. At
    the same time, Searlos got going, ringing two pretty field goals, while
    Dayhoff also contributed two and Bihl continued his foul shooting,

    defense and offense, as well as possessing speed. Our team, in defeating

    the basketball league was organ- ized. All the colleges participated in tlu^
    organization of this as.socia- tion save Dickinson and Gettysburg. Th. y
    both stated that, while thov favored such an association, they had not been
    authorized to become meni- ber,< of a collegiate body. H. A. Ben- fcr,
    director of athletics at Albright collese, a graduate of that institu- tion
    and one of the most wonderful all-aiMiind athletes of his day. was elected

    Muhlenburg. Juniata, Albright, Bucknell and Susquehanna. The .sec- retary
    waa instructed to communi- cate with Dickinson and Gettysburg formally
    inviting them to enter as the seventh

Content: was held. This wa.s due to the fact that most of the students were just
    recovering from examina- tions and had had no time to spend in preparation
    of a program, it was therefore thought advisable to holil the meeting in
    which the afternoon will be spent with James

Heading: Whitcomb
Content: Riley, this coming Wedne.sday, rath- er than last Wednesday. This should prove
    an Interesting and valuable meeting and it is hoped that a good- sized crowd

Heading: and

Heading: Forums
Content: were never in danger as the score

Heading: wa<<
Content: not close. Every

Heading: With
Content: the calibre of ball played by | the Orange and Blue on the small Oetty.<burg
    floor,

Heading: a

Heading: game
Content: on our floor, the score of which was 31 to 30 in our favor, would have witnessed
    an even greater battle had they seen this game.

Heading: From

    that the

Heading: game
Content: would be a olo-;e one. Such a defeat can well be con- sidered a victory, for the

Heading: made
Content: the remark before the game tliat if Gettysburg did not defeat a team by five
    points on that floor, it was practically a defeat. Because each team

Content: floor by one point, the Bucknell

Heading: management
Content: challenged Gettysburg to a third

Heading: game
Content: to be played on a neutral floor. Gettysburg has not yet answered tho challenge.
    The first half ended with the score 12 to 9 in Gettysburg's favor. Both
    teams were fighting hard, but tho Orange and Blue had not yet become
    accustomed to the floor, the forwards being unable to locate the basket.

Heading: Our
Content: points this half were as a result of a field goal and 5 fouls by Bihl and a
    field goal by Dayhoff. Gettysburg started the .second half with two field
    goals and a foul. Thr? Bucknell tossers located the basket and made a spurt,
    scoring four field goals, tying it up at 17.

Heading: From
Content: then on, until the last minute of the half things were nip and t\ick. With
    thirty seconds to go and Gettysburg ahead. 26 to 24, "Vic" Bihl dribbled up
    the floor and .shot the basket, tyin^i the score.

Heading: A

    both teams mlslng shots at the bas- ket.

Heading: A

    loft for play in which lime Bucknell had ihrt>o shots roll around the

    over Oet- ty.sburg In Lewlsburg

Heading: on
Content: Saturday night? As far as the casual newspaer reader is concerned the contest
    was merely an ordinary one-point victory of one rival quintet over another.
    But to the veteraif Gettysburg sport followers it carries with it a vast
    signiflcance. For twenty years Bucknell has been a leading rival of
    Gettysburg.

Heading: Even
Content: before the days of the historic battles on Island park in Ilarrisburg, the two
    rivals met flrst in Lewlsburg, then in Gettysburg. Always the rela. tlous
    between the two, although at

Heading: Umes
Content: bitter In their rivalry, were al- ways fair. The better team nearly always won.
    Getysbiirg admits fair- ly that the Bucknell elevens led by the agile Tip
    Tophaiii, the great end Jordan, and others of more recent years have always
    played superior ball to the boys frora the battlefield. The cry

Heading: "we

Heading: From
Content: a constant cryer It atracts no attention. Tills situation, however, is differ-
    ent. For the past six years no Get- tysburg basketball team has ever re-
    turned here in defeat or victory with the alibi of receiving poor treatment.

Heading: Monday
Content: morning, however, the hone-t opinion of the

Heading: men
Content: was that they had lost to Bucknell because in the last few minutes of play
    Kefcree Earnest, a young

Heading: man
Content: from Williams- port,

Heading: who
Content: was not a Central Board official such as is provided for visit- ing teams in
    Getty.sburg, persisted in calliur: fouls until nneknell tallied the neces-
    sary point to win. i Such treatment as

Heading: was
Content: afforded Gettysburg at Lewlsburg topples Bucknell from tlie high pedestal i
    where she once stood in the minds | of all Gettysburg pportsnuu and places
    her. in a class with Carlisle High School where Gettysburg schol- astic
    teams perpetually receive poor treatment. All of which leads to tho
    question, is it better to win in point of score or in point of
    sportsmanship? .

Heading: games
Content: of the season. It was fast and rough throughout, both teams being very

Heading: much
Content: In evidence in the ferocious tactics. Aleshouckas start- ed the scoring by
    tossing a foul after about four minutes of hard basket- ball. It was then
    clearly evident that the score would be low as neither team seemed able to

Heading: work
Content: the ball under the basket for a shot. The first half ended with the score 6-4 in
    favor of the S. A. E.s.

Heading: When

    being a specialty. The Phi P.sls. without Julian, played their usual scoring
    game, \s ith

Heading: how
Content: a more friend- ly feeling Is growing between tho Orange and Blue and It down-
    river rivals.

Heading: "A
Content: 

Heading: game
Content: of greatest skill was that on the Bucknell fioor last Thursday night.

Heading: Tho
Content: the Orange and Maroon lacked nine points for the victory, does in no

Heading: way
Content: say they were beaten or outplayed; but filled with burning eagerness to get even
    In the next con- test, is the essence of It all.

Heading: The
Content: old and bitter rival of the Orange and Maroon, challenging the utmost power and
    skiii. ambition ami hopes, started the

Heading: game
Content: at a fast ami energetic pace.

Heading: The
Content: close calling of fouls and scrimmage together with the good sportsmanship of the
    stu- dent body

Heading: made
Content: the

Heading: game
Content: clean and interesting. Bucknell took the lead In scoring by means of two fouls,
    but were soon left behind by the rapid scoring of Rogawicz and Leidick.

Heading: Thus
Content: during the first half it

Heading: was
Content: a question to the spectators

Heading: who
Content: would win, (for thfi close alternating score varied but little.

Heading: The
Content: half ended with the score favoring Bucknell 22-18. After a rest, and sharp
    criticism by Coach Stahl the second half began.

Heading: With
Content: a lead of four points and the accurate shooting of Searles, Buck- nell was
    barely able to keep in the lead until the end. The contest

Heading: was

    and tho>>e

Heading: who
Content: gathered in the chapel were well pleased with It. While the audience was not so
    large sm it Hhould have been, it waa appreciative. Prof. L. L. Rockwell gave
    a very comprehensive review of Kipling'.^ life, his works, and his present-
    day reputation Following are some of the high lights from the speech:
    Rudyard Kipling was born In

Heading: Bom-
Content: bay, India, in 1865, of very able par- ents. At the age of five he

Heading: was
Content: sent off to ICngland for his education; and at eighteen returned to the country
    of his birth with the intention of pur- suing a journalistic career. After a
    year or two, however, he entered into what

Heading: was
Content: destined to become hie life work,

Heading: when
Content: his first book

Heading: came
Content: out in 1886. Three years later he re- turned to England by

Heading: way
Content: of the United States, from which trip the inipre.'isions of America," emerged.
    In 18U0, his first novel. "The Light that Fulled." appeared, it being re-
    markable because Kipling wrote two diflerenl endings to it. After his
    marriage to an American, he resided for four years in Vermont.

Heading: Then
Content: he took his trip through the British colonial possessions, his writings con-
    crening these winning for him the title of the "Higlit Priest of the Brit-
    ish Empire. ' Kipling's later work, lujwever, has bi.cn deteriorating and is
    far from being equal to his earlier writings. The works of his youth have
    been criticisid as being unfair to women, containing few philo.soph- ical
    ideals, and being overdrawn. Lawreiu.B Kimball sang

Heading: "On
Content: . the Iload to Mandulay." accompanied by ivathryne Wagner, and responded to an
    encore with "Banjo Song." Har- ry F. Koye recited Kipling's "If." and was
    followed by Clara Casner.

Heading: who
Content: gave a parody on "If." Emily Uevine recited

Heading: "Gunga
Content: Din." All of these numers where well delivered and added

Heading: much
Content: to the enjoyment of Kipling. The last feature of the afternoon was the giving of
    "The Incarceration of .Mulvaney," by Prof. G. F. Rass- weiler. The
    professor's handling of this story almost converted some of his Frosh
    students In the audience to his standard. For those

Heading: who
Content: had never read the story, the

Heading: number
Content: was a delihtgful treat, while for those wliu liad TL-ad it, a

Heading: On
Content: Tuesday the Demies and For-

Heading: umH
Content: fough out a very cIohc game, tho Ueinles wlnuinK by the Bcore of 2 3 to 21. The

Heading: game
Content: wa.s hard fouKht all the way, the Kcore flrst being in favor of one team and
    then the ohter. The

Heading: game
Content: might have ended in a tie had DeCourHey shot a few Bee- ends earlier, as the
    ball dropped thru the net Immediately after the whistle blew, but the basket
    did not count. Foxall, Tingley and Ross played a fine

Heading: game
Content: for the Demies, while De- Coureey was the leading point scorer for the Forums.
    On iMonday night the Non-Frats suffered their second defeat in tht' hands of
    the

Heading: Sigma
Content: Chi qulntete.

Heading: The
Content: team work and accurate passing and shooting was too

Heading: much
Content: for the Non- Frat aggration, which was not up to its usual form. Dorris

Heading: made
Content: the In- itial Bcore and later

Heading: Mangan
Content: further added to it. Hall intercepted a pass and shot a ba.sket, thus

Heading: making
Content: the first score for that team.

Heading: Townsend
Content: made a field goal and

Heading: Horan
Content: a foul goal, making the score 7-3 In the Sigs favor. But the Non-Frats were not
    to he left behind, for Treadwell made a pretty basket from the middle of the
    floor and Coe followed with another one, thus tying the score at 7 points
    However. Woodring broke the tie with a field goal and

Heading: Mangan
Content: further increased their lead with two more goals before the end of the first
    half, which ended in a 14-7 score. In the second half Townsend and Miller
    .scored two points for thoir respective teams, thus starting the scoring.
    The Sigs proceed to greatly increase their lead

Heading: and
Content: the

Heading: game
Content: soon became spiritless

Heading: when
Content: the Non-Frats apparently lost their old-time fight- ing spirit.

Heading: The
Content: Non-Frats succeeded in scoring 3 points in the .second half and the

Heading: game
Content: ended in a Slg victory with a score of 32 to 10. In the second

Heading: game
Content: 

Heading: Lambda
Content: Chi defeated the

Heading: Kappa
Content: Sigmas by a score of 22-20 in a hard and close game. Aleshouckas started the
    scor- ing with a field goal and Doc

Heading: Mohkr
Content: in turn

Heading: made
Content: the initial score for

Heading: Kappa
Content: Sigma. The

Heading: Lambda
Content: Chi team played a fine passing game while the passing of the

Heading: Kappa
Content: Sig team wa.-i poor. The score was tied at 4 points The Kappa Slgs obtained

Heading: many
Content: trie.s at foul goals but lacked an acurate foul shooter and were not able to
    tally up

Heading: many
Content: one-points.

Heading: The
Content: 

Heading: Lamb-
Content: da Chls went in the lead and then the

Heading: Kappa
Content: Slgs advanced to the front rank. The score

Heading: was
Content: again tied at 8 points. Dinn

Heading: made
Content: a field goal just before the whistle ending the half which nded in a 8-11 score.
    Caldwell began the scoring in tho .second half with a field goal and the

Heading: Lambda
Content: Chis further increased their lead with 3 more field goals while the

Heading: Kappa
Content: Sigs were getting one field and one foul goal.

Heading: Hahn
Content: and .\les- houckas were taken, from the

Heading: game
Content: and Arnold and Martin put in in their places. The scoring again be- came close
    at 20-19 and then Clare

Heading: made
Content: the final score by caKing a pretty one from the middle of the floor. Caldwell
    played a wonderful

Heading: game
Content: for the

Heading: Lambda
Content: Chis, as did .Mohler for the

Heading: Kappa
Content: Sigs.

Heading: The
Content: S.

Heading: A.
Content: E. shooting squad op- ened their guns on the diniin\itive Beta

Heading: Kappa
Content: Psis on Wednesday af- ternoon, but their eyes did not seem to be in good
    condition and they

Heading: won
Content: only with a margin of two points after a pitched battle. Bellack was the star of
    the game, scoring 18 of the S. A. E.'s 24 points.

Heading: H.
Content: Mussina was the best scorer for the Beta Kap- pa's, caging 4 baskets, and with
    the able assistance of Long with 3 bas- jkets, kept his team in the running.
    I The first half ended with the S. A. 'E.'s on the small end of a 14-7
    score. During the Intermission, Dorey wa.^ switched from guard to forward
    and Williams went back to guard. Aftei this change the S. A. E.'s Woke up
    and forged ahead, thus capturing the honor end of a 2 4-22 score.

Heading: On
Content: Wednesday night the

Heading: Kappa
Content: Slgs started the evening with an easy victory at the expense of IMii Theta
    Sigma, 47-7. The

Heading: game
Content: was , very uninteresting, due to the un- evenly matched teams, but some en-
    Joyipent

Heading: was
Content: gleaned from watching "Doc" Mohler and

Heading: Hahn
Content: pile up the points. Moliler

Heading: was
Content: the big scorer of the evening, caging 13 field goals.

Heading: Hahn
Content: ran second with seven. The first half ended with the score 19-1. The Theta
    Sigmas finally located the basket in the second half, but not often enough.

Heading: The
Content: second

Heading: game
Content: of the evening, between the Phi

Heading: Gams
Content: 

Heading: and
Content: the

Heading: Non
Content: Frats,

Heading: was
Content: the most hotly contested of the three. It started off with the Phi

Heading: Gams
Content: taking the lead and looked like another deftat for the

Heading: Non
Content: Frats but the boys .soon got their eye on the basket and forged ahead, never tu
    be again overtaken. Miller was tho star of the

Heading: game
Content: with 5 ba.skets Credit Is due "Flatwheel ' Lewis

Heading: who
Content: was substituted for Rabb at the start of the second half.

Heading: He
Content: practically

Heading: won
Content: the

Heading: game
Content: for the

Heading: Non
Content: Frats by caging three weird shots from the center of the floor.

Heading: Reed
Content: was the star of the Phi

Heading: Gams
Content: with his close guarding and rapid passing. The first half ended with the

Heading: Non
Content: Frats leading. 20-13.

Heading: The
Content: second half wa:^ practically a repititlon of the first with the

Heading: Non
Content: Frats again outscorlng their opponents.

Heading: The
Content: 

Heading: game
Content: ended In favor of the

Heading: Non
Content: Frats with the score of 33-23.

Heading: The
Content: third game, between the Slg ma. Chis and the

Heading: Forum
Content: 

Heading: was
Content: an easy victory for the Sigs.

Heading: They
Content: had their shooting eyes and every

Heading: man
Content: on th'- team contributed something to the score.

Heading: The
Content: Sigs seem to have hit their regular stride after two early season defeats.

Heading: The
Content: passing of the Slg team was pretty to watch and

Heading: Townsend
Content: 

Heading: made
Content: it worth while by caging 7 baskets. Gehret played a fine

Heading: game
Content: for the Forums, but could not beat the Sigs single-handed. The first half ended
    with the score stand- ing 19-9. The second half the Sigs increa.sed their
    lead and the

Heading: game
Content: ended with the score 36-13, the Sigs taking the bacon, eggs 'n ev'rythiqg. ^

Heading: members
Content: as its guest- at the banquet, but also stood the ex pense of having the team
    stay for it. Besides his, they lunched the team Thursday noon, and aided

    nearly per-

Heading: fy
Content: ed, only a fev^r minor details re- mrinlng to be settled.

Heading: The
Content: book It- .^elf, while

Heading: much
Content: the same In outside appearance as its predecessors, will l.p greatly improved in
    all depart- (nents lu addition to having one or

Heading: two
Content: new ones. The editor-ln-chlef, Finley Keech, together with hip staff, has put

Heading: much
Content: work on the

Heading: new
Content: *'L.'Agenda" and prospects are that the work will not have been in vain.

Heading: The
Content: manager,

Heading: Hugh
Content: Kyttle. has had his difficulties with the labor mar- ket, etc.. and he is by no
    means through. The book is to be dedicated to Pro- fessor Paul George Stolz,
    head of the Music School. Prof. Stolz has been with Buckneli University for

Heading: many
Content: year^, and his untiring efforts In Ita activities, such as the musical organ-
    izations, are highly deserving of thi.^ recognition.

Heading: The
Content: dedication is to be written by

Heading: Dean
Content: Phillips. Follow- ing the dedicatory will be a

Heading: mem-
Content: orial page for Dr.

Heading: Enoch
Content: Perrine. Eight pages of cameo-plate views are to be included. With but one or
    two e.Nceptions, these views will be from fresh points of view, and
    pbotopraphK of the campus thu-t have appeared in "L' Agenda.s" in the past
    will

Heading: nnd
Content: no place.

Heading: The
Content: editor has a novel

Heading: way
Content: of indicating these views that is too good to spoil by explain- ing beforehand.
    The faculty section will fbow an- other departure from the old

Heading: way
Content: of doing things. Instead of the shop- worn, stiff photographs which have
    appeared, snap-shots will be the or- <<r. This section will occupy six
    pages. The four classes are to be arranged In order of their importance and
    will have individual photographs placed in pan^-1 form, with seven pictures
    to a panel, and one panel to a page. Names,

Heading: home
Content: towns, college organiza- tions, etc.. will appear opposite the pictures.

Heading: The
Content: Junior class, will of course occupy the greatest space and be given the greatest
    consideration In all matters, as the book is essen- ' tially a production of
    this class. Of the

Heading: two
Content: remaining classes the Sopho- mores will have considerable space devoted to them,
    while the Frosh will get all that is coming to th<>Tn. I

Heading: A
Content: 

Heading: new
Content: feature of this "L" Agenda" will be the Music School Department. There will be
    Individual pictures of the Senior Musicals, while in this de- partment will
    also be included the Glee Club, the Glrl.s* Glee Club, and ' other
    organizations of like nature The enrollment of the .school will be included.
    This step has been taken because of the fact that this depart- ment in the
    clrriculum is as of vital importance as any other and should be accorded
    deserved recognition. Fraternities and sororities and College Activities
    will be fully dealt with. Athletics will have a big de- partment, and will
    Include the rec- ords of all the seasons, and in addi- tion the records of
    the Interfrater- nity basketball season.

Heading: The
Content: depart- ment will be headed with a full his- tory of the beginnings of Athletics
    at Buckneli as written by Prof. Brom- ley Smith. Prof. Smith is fully eap-
    able of doing proper Justice to an article of this .sort, and he has done

Heading: From
Content: the Baptist Education Board he has received ?31,898, or a total of $60,000 in

Content: of corporate industry," a debating team representing Bucknell lost the two to
    one decision to three orators from Swarthmore last Friday evening In
    Bucknell Hall. That Bucknell lo.st once more Is a matter of history to go

Heading: down
Content: along side of the other two defeats of this year, but as a

Heading: medium
Content: of getting at the basis of very real problems, the debate

Heading: was
Content: 

Heading: shown
Content: to be very effi- cient. Sherwood Eddy brought before the student body some real
    Issues concerning social labor problems, and the subject under consideration
    Frl- j day night, being right In line with the thought of the students, was
    the subject of ninre than a little Interest

Heading: Some
Content: valual)le facts on eitlier side of the proposition were brought for- ward. The
    affirmative side of the (jues- tlon was ably introduced by the cap- tain of
    the Swarthmore team, Allan C. Valentine.

Heading: He
Content: declared that rep- resentation in industry

Heading: was
Content: to be compared with r^ presentation in gov- ernment, and that taxation witliou*
    representation was tyranny. The af- firmative attack as a whole

Heading: was
Content: upon the principle of the fact that the workers were entitled to a voice in
    management. They pointed out that the existing conditions were far from
    satisfactory

Heading: and
Content: produced sharing plans, such as is in u.-^e by the Phila- delphia Rapid Transit
    Company, fo support their contention that to give labor a voice in the

Heading: management
Content: was to solve the problem.

Heading: On
Content: the other hand, the ncj^ativc argued from a legal basis and sliowed according to
    the law of the cas.-, r- p resentation in

Heading: management
Content: v/as r.ot legal. They upheld the case of the public, the great body of people

Heading: who
Content: arc neither capital or labor, and d--

Heading: manded
Content: justice for them. They ar- gued that sharing in

Heading: management
Content: was not feasible, that it

Heading: was
Content: undem- ocratic and that it

Heading: was
Content: against Amer- ican initiative . It was perhaps the last speaker of the
    affirmative

Heading: who
Content: 

Heading: won
Content: for Swarth- more. He, in a forceful presentation, set over against the legal
    argument of the negative the

Heading: human
Content: side of the case, and

Heading: wound
Content: up the plea for his side In an appeal to the rights of la- bor against

    sheets, it bids fair to surpass anything In the L' Agenda line that has
    appeared at Bucknell In recent years.

Heading: The
Content: ma- terial for the book Is being forward- ed to the printers as fast as it can
    be gathered together by the board, and I put into .-!hape on the copy

Heading: new

    days set aside for the particular work of ordering tlxi college annual by
    the Ktudentn. The.se two days designated are Ap- ril 8th and 9th, the week
    following our return fro mthe Easter recess. They will be

Heading: known
Content: as "L'Agenda Days" and the business staff of the be coveiKi with information
    con- cerning the days, and gentle remind- ers that tlie drive is on to

Heading: make
Content: this year's L'Agenda the most read book in colleg< for days to come.

Heading: When
Content: the L'An^nda Is ordered, a deposit of $2.00 will be asked and a receipt giv- en.
    Then

Heading: when
Content: the books arrive, the receipt and an additional $3. 00 will entitle tliose

Heading: who

    final order for the number of books will be forward- ed to the printers, it
    being only a lim- ited number of copies beyond the !

Heading: number
Content: ordered by the student body. The same plan has been announced heretofore In this
    one regard, but M>>nagt-r Kyttle says he means busi- ness this year, and
    that if any of the students are unable to secure their books after the ;
    peclai ordering days are over, they will have themselves to thanl< for their

    names on the Registrar's Association list of distinguished en- gineers,

    faddists, dreamers and socialists, socialism Is the science of selfish-
    ness; the falalcy of failure. Educa- tion should Instill in the mind a pas-
    sion for service, for constructive ef- fort. Desire to serve Is a more noble
    trait than a desire to get. Financial returns should be viewed as the re-

Content: the trip were gathered together. At Pitman the first successful con- cert of the
    trip was given, and al- though there was no dance after the concert, the

Heading: men
Content: were entertained royally at their ovemirht homes. ThI.s concert was the first of
    a string of the most succeFi:ful con- certs the club has ever put on. In
    every instance the members putting their best into their work. The club was
    at its best with its collection of numbers of varying se^r- iousncss; and
    manager Hartz filled the office of director very acceptably in the absence
    of Prof. Paul Stolz The quartette had a revised series of songs and the duet
    by Willman and Rounsley, although of grand opera, was well received. Keech'a
    cartooning again proved itself the best of the light numbers on the pro-
    gram. Robert Hartz played his vio- lin to perfection and the vbcal solo-
    ists

Content: Donald Cloward and

Heading: Homer
Content: Eaton, were at their best.

Heading: One

Heading: H.
Content: Melhuish. This was "Mel's" first appearance with the club and his work, both
    classical and jazz, took wonderfully.

Heading: He
Content: was ably accompanied by Fred Moore at the piano. The second concert w{.s given
    in Vineland. Here, in the afternoon, cars were furnished and the members of
    the club were taken to various points of interest. One of these was the
    State Hospital for the Insan*'. with its companion institution, under
    private management, immediately across the road. This latter institu- tion,
    through its able heads and earnest work, has pained a world- wide
    reputation. The

Heading: men
Content: were also taken to a scientific glass works, where they were

Heading: shown
Content: the process- es of making glass instruments for scientific use. At Vineland a
    dance was given after the concert. In Bridgeton, no elaborate prep- arations
    for entertainment had been made, but one or two of the

Heading: men
Content: went to the glass works here on their

Heading: own
Content: hook, while othe^i, were initiated into the mysteries of the raceway. Following
    the concert a social wa.? held in the >>ehurch. It was at this concert that
    a most regrettable inci- dent occurred. Following the dui?t between Willman
    and Rounsley. they were called back to the stage by pro- longed and
    vocifcroup applause.

    England, the present great famine i8 doing to those In China. The stu- dents
    are forsakHng their classroonv in response to a call for need. Several of
    the Chinese colleges al- ready have cloeed, and the students have gone to
    the stricken dlstricls in the quickly mobilized

Heading: arm
Content: of re- lief workers through whose efforts

Heading: many
Content: 

Heading: among
Content: the millions left desti- tute by flood and drought are being kept alive with
    food rushed in from the outside world. In other Institutions, where some
    students still remain, they are divid- ing their food with the starving folk
    of the five stricken provinces on the "stint yourself to save" plan.

Heading: And
Content: this is one of the ctriking signs of the awakening in the new- republic for
    which our

Heading: own
Content: American colleges are largely responsible. Whatever progressive Western spirit
    China has today, she

Heading: owes

Content: 

Heading: and
Content: 

Heading: women
Content: educated here and in Europe,

Heading: many
Content: of whose ex- pense* at American universities and colleges were paid for out of
    Boxer indemnity money. Her hope for the fuUire rests with

    call for

Heading: work
Content: in famine relef became po ur- gent, the 800 students of the Univer- sity of

Heading: Nanking
Content: petitioned the au- thorities of that institution to re- duce the

Heading: amount
Content: of food served at the student table In order that

Heading: what
Content: should be saved might be sent to the famine vlcitms.

Heading: They
Content: saved 1800 during the first half of the school year, besides con- tributing more
    than $3,000 in cash. $800 is a lot of

Heading: money
Content: in China. Board at the U. of

Heading: N.
Content: costs abou>> $3.50 a month. No, not a day, or -v^.eek-- a month! Figure up and
    you'll see that the Chinese student? really stinted themselves. They saved a
    good

Heading: many
Content: lives. At current prices in China .their $800 would buy 20 tons of sweet
    potatoes, 13 tons of mllet, 5000 pounds of meat, or 8000 pounds of fish.

Heading: The

Heading: Many

Heading: made

Content: sentiment for Bucknell. In the afternoon of the day the concert was given, the
    boya gave a short program before the high school, which was excellent Indeed
    and

Heading: won
Content: the student body. There will, I feel quite certain, be more students for
    Bucknell from

Heading: West

Heading: won
Content: the confidence and esteem of everybody. Their conduct wa.s of the highest order
    and re- flected favorably the characterof Bucknell. 1 would earnestly advise

Content: 1922 L'Agenda has been coni- lileted: The final copy sheets liiive been
    forwarded to Baker-Jones-Hau- naiur, Inc , of Buffalo, the printers of the
    book this year, and tims has been completed what has all the appear- ances
    of being the best year book that has been published at Bucknell for some
    years. Finley Keech, the ed- * ,\6r. aided by his staff, has been working
    hard for peveral months In an tndeavor to

Heading: make
Content: the book the very last word in college annuals for the year, and a book of which
    the college

Heading: may
Content: well be proud.

Heading: Word
Content: comes back from the printers that

Heading: work
Content: on the book Is progressing nice- ly, and that the proof sheets will be forwarded
    in the very near future.

Heading: An
Content: effort has been

Heading: made
Content: to get the book published before the contem- plated printers' strike, which is
    ex- pected the first of May.

Heading: The
Content: book is arranged Irt tw<<lvo Hections. or departments, consistinK of the

Heading: new
Content: view section, the faculty, the classes, the music department, the fraternities,
    the Rlrls' fraternities, publications, college activities, liter- ary
    department .athletics, feature ;*-- lions and the advertising section. Of
    most of these,

Heading: much
Content: has been said in previous material on the obok, bu* there is

Heading: much
Content: that has not been said about the book that cannot l)e ex- pressed until the
    publicatibn is dis- tributed to those

Heading: who
Content: have sul) wcrlbfed. Every department is com- plete in itself, and covers the
    life of the college from the issuing of last gear's book until the 15th of
    March, this year. In the department of publication-? Tvill be included the
    L'Agenda,

Heading: The
Content: Bucknellian, The Alumni Monthly, the

Heading: Commencement
Content: News, and last, but not least, the staff (?) of "The Woodpecker,' the
    announcement of which will be awaited with

Heading: much
Content: anxiety on the part of many. The view section contains only !liree pictures that
    have appeared in Jormer L' Agendas. Thus, covering t:ight pages,

Heading: many
Content: 

Heading: new
Content: views of the campus and buildings will be pre- sented,

Heading: making
Content: a splendid change in the book from previous years. Special mention should be
    made of the snow Kcene across the athletic field and the sunset view of the
    *Hill' 'from across the Susquehanna river. This view Kfcction is headed by a
    beautiful plate entitled *Campus." which has been prepared by the printers,
    and which Hhows the Sixth Street entrance to the campus to good advantage.
    The departments of college organ- izations and activltie^ of former year.s
    have been combined in one depart- Bient this year, thus giving the whole
    range of college and student activ- ities in one section. The literary
    department, covering nineteen pages, is headed by a liter- ary masterpiece
    entitled. "Nature's Setting for Bucknell," written by Dr. Martin in
    commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the jniverslty.
    Four pages are devoted to this article.

Heading: The
Content: remaining pages contain the efforts of several of our budding authors, two of
    the.se en- deavors being illustrated to add to the novelty of the
    department. Sev- tral are of a more serious turn, and have real literary
    ability displayed in them. The athletic department Is com- plete, covering
    football, baseball, track, girls- athletics, the letter m'>n cf the class,
    and a splendid article on *The Beginning of Athletics at Buck- nell," by
    Prof. Bromley Smith, writ- ten after a great deal of research work along
    this line, going back a.? far as lJ>71t. Accounts

Heading: and
Content: photos In connection with the Sophomore- Freshman football and basketball Fames
    are also included in this^ sec- lion. Of most vital interest will be the
    feature sections, headed by a neat drawing of one of our anuable fresh- men,

Content: C. A. triangle, the training of the mind, body and spirit. At Buck- nell the
    training of

Content: and body is taken care of, and the important work of the Y.

Heading: W.
Content: C. A. is to look after the spiritual welfare cf the girls. "Before

Heading: A

    .Monday evening meetings, to attend morning watch, ao attend the conference
    at Ea^Iesmere or to help send others ,to willingly suve on some committee.
    Miss Conrad concluded by '-^aying if the school would cooperate with the

Content: Payne, the genial proprietor of the College Inn. "On the Quad- rangle," treated
    Senior Council and a number of guests to its annual ban- quet at his place
    of business Friday evening. It will be remembered that Payne started llii.s
    cualom last yeai

Heading: when
Content: Senior Council issued an order that the brigade of ducks kept by *Paynie."
    should either be kept off the campus or executed. Payne re- sponded by

    and

Heading: Mr
Content: \ Thcron Clark, Prof.>> Rhodes

Heading: and
Content: Prof. Rice. The banquet unwittingly '^t ivod a double purpose, as it turned out
    that Friday was the birthday of Dr Phil- lips, dean of the University, and
    ton- gratulaiions were extended tt him by the Council. The d.nner itself

Heading: was
Content: an epiciuean delight. Sliced oranges, tomato salad, roast guinea hen, mashcil pc
    tatoes and a host of other good things to eat were placed before the huiigry
    seniors and their guests, .ind th. empty plates after an hour '^ lattk
    testified as to their goodness. After the main part of the dinnei each diner
    was served with a huge f:lice of pie with the nickname of each guest upon
    his special piece. Even the pro- fessors were not spared, oh Prof Rhodes
    proudly exhibited his piece with the

Content: "Dusty" upon it ir. large letters, while Prof. Rice held his aloft, showing to
    all the world that "Jack has been inscribed there- on. Following the pie

    evening 1" a few words, Dr. Phillips told of the organization of Senior
    Council eleven years ago, and commented on its growth, both in numbers and
    influ- ence. He said he believed th.nt the present Senior Council had done
    eve. 'thing in its power for the bet- terment of Bucknell, and that he was
    very well pleased with the worlc that It had accomplished during the pres
    ent school year. Registrar Clark was next called upon, and told

Heading: how
Content: he had come tc have a great love for Bucknell In the short time that he had been
    here, and that this was In creasing every day. Professors Rice and Rhodes
    each gave excellent talks, carrying out the same general theme that Dr.
    Phillips had given. 11 wa:< remarked afterward by various

    followed every piece. At the clone of the dinner, each Senior and guest was

    "Bucknell-el-el" for "Puynte."

Content: that Is t!ie way romances end in the fairy tales. In reality, married life Is
    not always one joyous holiday. De- bates and di.scu.ssions of a more or less

    and humorous wordings in the public prints often reveal every-day happenings
    In the hou.sehold.

Heading: The
Content: press humorists show that those petty little arguments and misunderstand- ings
    are only trivial after all. In a pleasant, satirical vein. "Topics of the
    Daj' Films present the little ups and downs of married couples, and
    audiences laugh In sympathy with the people joked about. Married couples,

    Dietrich's drive deep Into center field, allowing

Heading: him
Content: to circumnavigate the sacks, regis- tered the only score in the

Heading: game
Content: against Lebanon Valley last Friday on Tustin Field. Dietrich on this ini- tial
    trip to the plate ignored the first offers of Wltmere, pitcher for Leba-

Heading: non

    ball with a wealth of weight and pounded the pill clean over the center

    four hits which his running males, with excellent fielding, qukkly

Heading: won
Content: his heat in exceptoinally fast time

Heading: Due
Content: to the crowding at the Btart he

Heading: was
Content: forced back, but on the back stretch, with a wonderful burst of speed, he forced

Content: For the first time in the past two years a really interested crowd at- tended
    the tennis match which wai played last Friday afternoon witli Swarthmore.
    The fact that tlie stu- dent body are behind their represent- atives even in
    the most minor of minor sports certainly shows a spirit worthy of
    commendation. It was an honor for our tennis team to tie Swarthniore because
    of the latter'.-' ^ast Kecord. They have defeated U. fit P., Lehigh, Army,
    and other large institutions of repute. The fact that

Heading: we
Content: were able to tie them in the re- cent match was in a large measure due to the
    support from the sidelines which shows that while our tracli and baseball
    teams are

Heading: away
Content: we will support what we have and do it well.

    inference, however is that no college r;roup had any informa- tion other
    than the chapel announce- ment. Whether the idea was "clean politics" or
    politics otherwise is a matter which everyone

Heading: who
Content: is inter- ested must judge from the facts of the case. If the decision Is

    so I turn back to the first 'page of the annals and read: "The I
    Northumberland Baptist Association i met in 1845 and resolved to found a
    high school for males, another for females, a college, and also a theo-
    logical institute.

Heading: The
Content: charter of the university at Lewisburg was signed on February 5, 1&46, by the
    governor of Pennsylvania. Stephen

Heading: H.
Content: Taylor was elected principal of the school and on October 5 of the same year,
    classes were organized in the base- ment of the Baptist church until the
    completion of the building. The fac- ulty consisted of Stephen

    completed and plans were

    Buchanan, afterward presi- dent of the United States, degrees were conferred
    upon the first class presented for graduation

    raised for buildings and the Ladles' Institute was moved into the building
    at the corner of Second and St. Louis streets, with Miss Had- assah Scribner
    as principal. In 1854-55 the theological depart-

    of fiixteen, I attempted to preach in vai;ious places. In 1847 I noticed a
    movement had been for .some time on foot to establish the "University at
    Lewisburg. " I

Heading: made
Content: arrange- ments to go. and reached our Stat capital by rail. I remembered a part
    of a lesson in Olney's Geography lik-j this:

Heading: "What
Content: is a canal?" Answer:

Heading: "A
Content: canal is an artificial channel filled with water, for the easy, speedy and cheap
    transportation of good; from one section of the country to another." I
    wanted to see a canal and sail on one; but a fre.shet had put the
    Susquehanna canal out of business and I had to take a stage and travel all
    night. In the fore- noon of the next day the driver stopped at the end of
    the old Market streei bridge and handed

Heading: down

Heading: my
Content: trunk. Not liking to leave it here as it was, I could but pick It up and walk
    across. I found the university in a brick church edifice on the sit of the
    present music hall. There were three rooms in the basement. In the largest
    one there were rows of plain red desks at which the students were seated.

    desks clapping us on our march. Still

Heading: we
Content: had the girls on the other side and were proud to consider them our better half.
    Noble girls I believe them to be and felt that their influ- ence was
    salutory. They were forming a Freshman class

    to take the telescope on his shoulders in the ev- ening and go up to the
