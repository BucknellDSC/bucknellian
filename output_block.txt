Hardly a day passes \nnow without a steady progression of wagons from the mountains \ncarrying large supplies of surplus grains, lumber, hides, and other \nproducts to the port.\nDue to the increase in trade, local industry is fast oq the rise. \nSeveral new foundries, tanneries, mills, and boat yards have recently \nbeen established. \nThe population has risen to 1220 persons.\nPerhaps the best way of realizing the extent of the development \nin this area is to compare the Lewisburg of today with the town as \nit was in 1813. The population in those days was a mere 250 persons. \nIndustry was confined to one primitive nail factory and, two very \nsmall tanneries. There were no churches then, but seven taverns, a \ndistillery, and a brewery were very much in existence. \nThe taxes \ncollected that year came to only $98.88. Trading as we have come to \nknow it today did not even exist.\nIt seems incredible that so much progress could be achieved in \nso short a period. \nBut the facts indicate that Lewisburg is well on \nits way to becoming one of the top ports in the area.\n', 16, 0), (568.0689697265625, 730.0693359375, 721.0205688476562, 962.467529296875, 'cers Association, \nthe Pennsyl\xad\nvania Bankers Trust \nTraining | \nSchool, the Pennsylvania Bankers \nAssociation Summer School, the \nBank Directors Conference of the \nPennsylvania \nBankers \nAssocia-1 \ntion, and the annual meeting of \nPennsylvania Baptist Laymen.\nLargest of the institutes held at \nBucknell this summer was the In-1 \nstitute for Foreign Students, with \n99 \nstudents \nrepresenting \n34 [ \nforeign ’ countries attending the | \neight-week program.\nOther institutes conducted over \nsix-week periods during the sum\xad\nmer included the Institute of \nAmerican Studies, the Institute \nfor Asian Studies^ the Summer \nInstitute for High School Teach\xad\ners of Science and Mathematics, \nthe Institute for High School \nScience Students, and the Sum-1 \nmer Institute in the Engineering j \nSciences.\n', 17, 0), (719.4589233398438, 730.7945556640625, 846.4188842773438, 746.7945556640625, 'Good Standing\n', 18, 0), (718.2589111328125, 752.8675537109375, 865.1118774414062, 836.2669677734375, 'Out of the 128 students whose \nreturn in September was condi\xad\ntioned upon their coming to sum\xad\nmer school, 36 completely restor\xad\ned themselves to good standing. \nAn additional 47 students met the \nspecific \nrequirement \nthat \nwas \nstated for them and have return\xad\ned on warning this fall.\n', 19, 0), (717.5589599609375, 840.9669189453125, 866.8189086914062, 961.066162109375, 'Ten additional students did not \nfully \nmeet \ntheir requirements \nduring the summer session, but \nwere permitted to return on the \nbasis of an extended warning. \nThese exceptions were made be\xad\ncause their summer work indicat\xad\ned an ability to raise themselves \nto good standing within one se\xad\nmester, \nand \ntheir \ncumulative \n| grade point averages are within \na reasonable distance of the good \nstanding requirement.\n', 20, 0), (481.40887451171875, 988.6271362304688, 814.156005859375, 1063.1761474609375, 'SCHOLARLY \nPAPERBACKS\n', 21, 0), (859.1578979492188, 979.5769653320312, 866.9019165039062, 995.5769653320312, '§\n', 22, 0), (419.01788330078125, 1183.868896484375, 430.5558776855469, 1197.868896484375, '18\n', 23, 0), (668.85986328125, 1079.9840087890625, 778.2738037109375, 1185.5311279296875, 'WE\nCARRY\nA\nCOMPLETE\nSTOCK\n', 24, 0), (481.8588562011719, 1203.020263671875, 813.6187744140625, 1251.8631591796875, 'o£dllteholaàlìf fmfwwacÁb \nfmMibhed \nfyfomwMity ÇPbeMeb:\n', 25, 0), (701.4588623046875, 1273.1856689453125, 763.7709350585938, 1399.3826904296875, 'CALIFORNIA\nCAMBRIDGE\nCHICAGO\nCOLUMBIA\nCORNELL\nINDIANA\nOXFORD\nWISCONSIN\nYALE\n', 26, 0), (548.368896484375, 1475.1180419921875, 766.0966186523438, 1514.1180419921875, 'Bucknell U.

Nixon countered Kennedy’s statement with \nthe declaration that America was on the move and had \nbeen so for the past seven and a half years. \nHe did not \ntouch on the question of civil rights at any time during \nthe evening.\nMore than half of the program time consisted of replies \nto questions formulated by four representatives from \nsponsoring networks. \nOne reporter confronted Nixon \nwith President Eisenhower’s remark that he could think \nof nothing contributed by Nixon during his term of office. \nRising to the occasion with equanimity, Nixon countered \nhis ipquisitor with the assurance that Ike’s remark was \nmerely facetious, for he could not possibly reveal the \nidentity of his advisors.\nDulling a barbed question, this repartee was as dazzling \nas the glittering generalities of “freedom” and “progress” \nwhich dripped like sticky honey from Kennedy’s tongue.\nWhat was the good of these debates? \nNeither man \nconcerned himself with major issues of party or country. \nVying with each other to- present the most scintillating \nimage of potential presidency, both candidates fingered \ncliches with surprising ease.\nOn a stark stage, Peck’s Bad Boy extolled the virtues \nof a democratic platform surprisingly similar to that of \nthe Republicans, described in words from the cadaverous \nface of the vice president. Having no audience reaction \nto play their words against, Kennedy and Nixon struggled \nto appear keen opponents of each other.\nThe result was an ineffectual discussion, leaving the \nviewer with little or nothing on which to base his allegi\xad\nance. \nThe candidates took no distinct stands on major \nissues, sallying instead from side to side in an attempt to \npick up votes. \nEven traditional party ideologies were \nabsent from their speeches.

Following is a \nlist of simple instructions which, if faithfully observed, will \npositively guarantee that you will be a mad success as a \nsorority girl.\nFirst, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The \nhousemother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You \nmust treat her with respect. When you wish to speak to her, \naddress her as “ Mother Sigafoos” or “ Ma’am.” In no circum\xad\nstances must you say, “Hey, fat lady.”\nSecond, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on \nthe front porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and \nshows a want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.\nThird, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing \nmeals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your \ncook goes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu varied \nand nourishing. The least you can do is show your apprecia\xad\ntion. Don’t just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with \ndelight, “ What delicious pork jowls!” or “ What a yummy soup \nbone!” or “ What scrumptious fish heads!” or “ What clear \nwater!”\nFourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance re- \n■ fleets not just on yourself but on the whole house. It was \nwell enough before you joined a sorority to lounge around \ncampus in your old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now \nyou must take great pains to dress in a manner which excites \nadmiring comments from all who observe you. A few years ago, \nfor example, there was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk \nat the University of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her \nsorors. Camille hit on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb \nto the class she was attending. For instance, to English Lit she \nwore a buskin and jerkin. To German she wore lederhosen and \ncarried a stein of pilsener. To Econ she wore 120 yards of \nticker tape. Her shiningest hour came one day when she \ndressed as a white mouse for Psych Lab. Not only her Chi \nOmega sisters, but the entire student body went into deep \nmourning when she was killed by the janitor’s cat.\n', 67, 0), (1433.027587890625, 1288.76513671875, 1678.762939453125, 1470.782470703125, 'Finally, let us take up the most important topic of all. I \nrefer, of course, to dating.\nAs we have seen, the way you dress reflects on your sorority, \nbut the men you date reflect even more. Be absolutely certain \nthat your date is an acceptable fellow. Don’t beat about the \nbush; ask him point-blank, “Are you an acceptable fellow?” \nUnless he replies, “Yeah, hey,” send him packing.\nBut don’t just take his word that he is acceptable. Inspect \nhim closely. Are his fingernails clean? Is liis black leather \njacket freshly oiled? Is his ukelele in tune? Does he carry \npublic liability insurance? And, most significant of all, does \nhe smoke Marlboros?\nIf he’s a Marlboro man, you know he has taste and discern\xad\nment, wit and wisdom, character and sapience, decency and \nwarmth, presence and poise, talent and grit, filter and flavor, \nsoft pack and flip-top box.

After altemat- \nng McKelvey and Tino at the \nquarterback spot last year he \nfound that he was wasting tal\xad\nent, and so shifted Tino over to \nleft halfback and put McKelvey \nat quarterback permanently. \nOr \nso he thought.\nAll this must have made every\xad\none at Ithaca very happy. \nAlso, \nin addition to the fast, hard hit\xad\nting Tino and the smooth accur\xad\nate passing McKelvey, there were \n18 lettermen returning and sev\xad\neral promising sophomores com\xad\ning up. \nCornell looked, forward \nto bettering last year’s 5-4 record.\nTino Injured\nLast week they carried Marcy \nTino off the field. At 195 pounds \nTino was the team’s main running \nthreat. He will be out the bet\xad\nter part of the season.\nLast Saturday Cornell met Col- | \ngate and ran into some more bad \nluck. \nBefore the end of the first | \nquarter they helped Dave M cK el-! \nvey off the field, and before the i \nhalf Colgate had \nscored four | \ntouchdowns and completely throf-! \ntied the Cornell offensive ma- 1  \nchine. \nIn the second half Cor\xad\nnell was to come back enough to \nscore once and pile up more yard\xad\nage on the ground and in the air \nthan Colgate, but the game ended \nin a 28-8 victory for a team that \nlast year won only twice and this j \nyear has lost almost its entire \nline.\nBut no matter how humiliating: \nthis opening defeat may be, the i \nBig Red will not slink into this \nSaturday’s game wth its tail b e -: \ntween its legs. Tino and McKel- \nvey were considered as one of the \nbest combinations in the Ivy \nLeague. They may be out, but 18 j \nlettermen covering all positions! \nremain. \nIf James can develop a | \npair of operational ends, Cornell \ncan spring back. \nOne answer is ! \nlast season’s regular slot back, | \nJohn Beggs, a senior who has had \nexperience at end. \nAnother may \nbe Lewisburg’s John Fenton who \nstarted several games last season.\nFeeney Hurt\nMissing this year will be Dave \nFeeney, an all-Ivy guard in 1959. \nHis able replacement will be cap\xad\ntain Warren Sundstrom. \nSund- \nstrom has exceptional speed and \nhas been outstanding as a line\xad\nbacker.\nAs for the question of the back- \nfield, the answer may be Bob Ritz \nwho took over for McKelvey last \nSaturday or any one of several \nother understudys. George Telesh \nwill be starting at fullback. \nHe \nis a quick starter and a hard run\xad\nner with good speed, and Coach \nJames will no doubt be counting \nheavily on him.\nJames’ revised Slot-T depends \nmore on speed than previously. \nThe right halfback used to be \nchiefly a blocker, but now runs \nthe \nball \nand \ncatches \npasses. \nGeorge Ekstrom who has run the \n60 yard dash in 6.2 seconds and \nwho last year averaged 4.8 yards \nper carry fills this key position. \nAlong with Telesh, he is possibly \none of the few bright spots in the \nCornell backfield.\n', 46, 0), (1120.5059814453125, 350.78131103515625, 1660.9959716796875, 366.88671875, 'COSGROVE NAMED BACK OF THE GAME\nChaump Out for the Season\n', 47, 0), (1102.2469482421875, 725.759765625, 1396.2449951171875, 813.2792358398438, 'Pictured above is junior halfback Ray Cosgrove who scored the \nwinning touchdown in last Saturday’s Bison triumph over Gettys\xad\nburg College.

Roosevelt’s \nproclamation?\nUnfortunately, \nthe \naudience \nwas not given sufficient informa\xad\ntion to formulate an answer to \nthe question.\nThe speaker discussed a group \nwhich he called “our second class \ncitizens of defense,” the Chemical \nCorporation. \nVery little was ac\xad\ntually revealed except that this \ngroup is responsible for basic re\xad\nsearch and development.\nMany problems accompany the \nuse of chemical and biological \nweapons. Control is very difficult \nand “chances for inspection are \nalmost nil.” \nProduction of the \nmaterials in question does not re\xad\nquire extreme skill. “Germs can \nbe made in anyone’s basement.”\nAnother serious threat is “Gun\xad\nrunner” organizations that sell \nthe \ndangerous \ncommodities \nto { \nsmall countries. \nRaskin raised ? \nanother question: If other coun- I \ntries have access to these means, i \nshould we tie our hands and make \nstatements limiting ourselves to | \ncertain types of “brutalization?” \nIf the Soviet is developing germ \nwarfare, shouldn’t we?\nPublic reaction is of utmost \nimportance in considering a sub- i \nject so vital to national security.! \nPeople have a moral repulsion \nto the idea of mass annihilation ! \nby chemical means.

The Bisons led 14-0.\nNot to be outdone by his run\xad\nning mate at quarterback, Rick \nElliot led Bucknell to its second \nTD of the quarter. \nElliot set up \nthe touchdown by running the \nright side—just as Terhes had \ndone—for 28 yards to the one \nyard line. \nTwo plays later he I \nsneaked over from the three. \nEarlier, Tom Noteware set up the , \ndrive by recovering a fumble on j \nthe Bulls 32 yard line. \nLess than \nthree minutes elapsed before the \nBucks hit the scoreboard again. \nDick Lebec fell on a visitor I \nfumble 15 yards from the goal I \nstripe. \n’ BU was penalized back \nto the 32 before they started roll\xad\ning. \nOn the second play from | \nthat point, Elliott, still piloting \nhis team, threw a perfect aerial \nto Dick Johnson in the end zone \nfor the tally. \nThe score at the \nend of the third period was 28-0.\nThe final period was equally \nenjoyable for BU rooters as the \nthird quarter was. Ron Maslanik \nstarted the ball rolling by block\xad\ning an Oliverio punt on the New \nYorker’s 26 yard stripe. \nKen \nTwiford bulled for a single yard \nand two plays later he slipped \nthrough the opponents defense on \na draw play for 16 yards and a \nscore. Faking a kick, Terhes went \nfor a two-pointer after the touch\xad\ndown, by throwing a pass to Twi\xad\nford, who made a spectacular div\xad\ning catch in the end zone. \nAn \noff-sides \npenalty \nnullified this \nplay but Maslanik promptly boot\xad\ned the PAT from five yards far\xad\nther back.\nDoug \nWilliams, \nthird \nBison \nquarterback of the day, continued \nthe scoring parade by engineer\xad\ning a drive totalling 92 yards. \nStarting on his own eight, the \nsophomore signal-caller led his \ntroops through 12 quick plays \nclimaxed by an eight yard toss to \nMarty Pope for the final six- \npointer of the day. \nLooking like \na veteran, Williams ran for 12 \nyards and completed three oout \nof three passes for 58 more.

C. courses.” \nIsn’t it a shame that student \nresponse to these innovations should be negligible during \nthe two weeks that “scholars” are preparing for and re\xad\ncovering from Homecoming?\nAlthough better scheduling of Homecoming with the \nbarrage of tests preceding six-week grades is a partial so\xad\nlution, the conflict between the “Old” and the “New” \nBucknell is yet to be resolved. \nAs students, we cannot \nconsider ourselves members of a university and still damn \nthose who study in preference to stuffing paper napkins.\n', 5, 0), (163.8898468017578, 894.3380737304688, 404.2899475097656, 919.3380737304688, 'Everyone Can Vote\n', 6, 0), (146.38995361328125, 927.3597412109375, 424.46978759765625, 1242.1405029296875, 'On Tuesday, November 1, Bucknellians will, we hope, \nflock to the polls one week before the rest of the nation. \nAn election will be held on this campus in which all stu\xad\ndents and faculty members may vote, regardless of age \nor out-of-state residence.

Ranging from his \n“I know what it is to be poor” of \nthe first debate to his emotional \nconclusion of the last debate, \nNixon has shown his reliance on \nemotion instead of fact.\nEmotional Appeal \nThis style of approach is not a \nnew one for Mr. Nixon. As far \nback as his congressional cam\xad\npaigning, he used the emotional \nappeal of labeling his opponents \nas “fellow travelers” with “Com\xad\nmunists” to his advantage.By dis\xad\ntorting the voting record of Mrs. \nHelen Douglas, he ruined her po\xad\nlitically. He compared her vot\xad\ning record on fairly routine mat\xad\nters with that of the Communist \nparty-liner Vito Marcantonio of \nNew York and inferred from this \nthat she was a communist sym\xad\npathizer. \nIn September of that \nyear, the Independent Review, \nfollowed then by many other \nnewspapers, charged Nixon with \ntrying to defame Mrs. Douglas by \n“falsely accusing her through in\xad\nfamous insinuation and whispered \ninnuendo of being a Communist.” \nHe used the same method quite \neffectively against Congressman \nVoorhis. (For more information \non this, read Costello’s The Facts \nAbout Nixon).\nClever Campaigning \nThroughout his campaigning, \nthe clever use of language helped \nhim to make fraudulent insinua\xad\ntions \nwithout \nbeing \nspecific \nenough to be charged with libel.\nIn the campaign of 1952, an\xad\nother form of his emotional ap\xad\npeal was shown. \nAccused and \nproven to have accepted funds \nfrom some wealthy California \nbusinessmen, \nNixon responded \nwith his now famous “Checkers \nspeech.” \nIs \nthis \nhonest and \nthoughtful campaigning?\nAnd now, as the Washington \nPost and Times Herald stated on \nSaturday, October 15, 1960 in an \neditorial:\nMr. Nixon also was moxe than \na little mean in persistently dis\xad\ntorting Mr. Kennedy's position. \nIt almost appeared as if his ad\xad\nvisors had coached him to get \nin and fight for blood.

When I re\xad\nturned this September I was quite concerned with the problem of \nfinding someone to read to me. \nThanks to your interest, the problem \nof finding readers has virtually been solved. \nI now have an ever in\xad\ncreasing list of people who are willing to read to me, and as some of \nthem know already, reading to me is not quite so hard as some may \nimagine. \nThey are finding such work not only to be helpful to me, \nbut a help to them.\nI hope that this shall continue to be the case, for I like the pro\xad\ncess of reading to be a two sided affair, where both parties benefit.\nTo those of you that are now reading to me, I do not think that a \nmere “thank you” as expressed by these printed words is sufficient, \nbut in many cases, words are often lacking in their ability to express \nfully the feelings behind them.\nSay Hello\nFor those of you who have stopped to make my acquaintance I \nam' grateful. \nAs I said in that first article, I would like to meet as \nmany people as possible and to get to know them.\nFear not, I w ill not, upon you introducing yourself to me, grab \nyou and say “Read to me.”  \nIf you are interested in doing reading, it \nw ill be left up Jo you to say so.\nMy World\n“My World” is the title under which I hope to write, during the \ncourse of this coming year, various articles telling of my world. \nIt \nis true that each of us sees the world in a different way. \nBut, know\xad\ning that to many of you my world would seem quite different from \nthat which you know, I hope that the world in which I live and the \nworld in which you live may prove to be connected. \nFor is not “ my \nworld” also your world?\nOne of the questions which I am frequently asked is: “How doi \nyou get around.” \nPerhaps one of the reasons why this question is \nso difficult to answer is that I myself do not really think about how \nI  get around. \nJust as you, day after day, go from here to there and \nback again Without really thinking about each step, so it is with me. ]\nW e all know how to walk, but if asked how to do it, most of us \nwould probably take a considerable amount of time in forming a \nclear informative answer to this question. \nSo it is when you ask me \nhow I get around; I must stop and think how to answer you as simply \nand understandably as possible. \nJust as each of you had to learn to \nwalk, I too had to learn some “tricks of the trade” of traveling. Many \nthings have become almost second nature now.\nI might as w ell begin with the most obvious of my “ tricks,” that \nis, my cane. \nI took a course at Overbrook in the use of a cane for \ntraveling. \nNaturally as with everything else, most of what I know \nabout using a cane has been learned through experience.\nCane Touch \n.\nAs you know, the sense of touch is very important to me. \nThe \ncane I carry is actually a means by which I am able to feel the \nground before me and know, to a greater or lesser degree, what is in \nmy path. \nThe cane is, in reality, an extension of my finger. \nCon\xad\ntrary to the general belief of most people, the cane is not used, ex\xad\ncept in rare incidents, to make a tapping noise.\nIt is used to tell the difference between the paved walk and the \nground or grass along side the walk. \nThus I use the edge of the] \nwalks as a guide to assist me in my travels. \nNaturally, if I happen \nto misjudge the edge of the walk, I may find myself on another path. \nHere at Bucknell where there is so many angled paths, it is very easy \nto get off a couple of degrees. \n.\nKeeping my general direction is very important also. \nIf you \nwere to transport me to some place completely unknown to me and \njust set me down there, I would have to take some pains to find out \njust which way to go. When coming to a new place for the first time, \nI usually have someone walk me to the various places where I am to \ngo. Thus I build up in my mind a sort of mental direction picture \nof where various buildings, etc, are located.\n", 49, 0), (1272.953857421875, 604.0172119140625, 1345.825927734375, 612.0172119140625, 'BESHIR KASSIS\n', 50, 0), (1239.103759765625, 628.4671630859375, 1381.9676513671875, 657.1170654296875, 'by Beshir Kassis \nOn June 14, 1830, a French ex\xad\npeditionary force of 37,000 men\n', 51, 0), (1380.953857421875, 362.0670471191406, 1537.7938232421875, 654.71484375, 'conquered Algeria after a war \nlasting 17 years. \nFollowing the \nassertion of-French military au\xad\nthority in the occupied territory, \nsteps were taken both in Algeria \narid France to assimilate and in\xad\ntegrate the Algerians. \nBut the ] \nAlgerian masses had clung des- \nperately to their Arabic tradition \nof language and it became ex-1 \ntremely difficult to overcome this j \nstrong attachment.\nThe Algerian National Move-1 \nI ment goes back to the few years j \nbefore the first World War.

The old phrase “Service with \na smile,” and the accompanying connotation of a willing\xad\nness to accommodate customers, seems to be completely \nbeyond the comprehension of the Merit Laundry Com\xad\npany.\nFor instance, the times set up for linen exchange are \nrather restrictive. If you are unable to take your linen to \nthe exchange point at the prescribed time, you incur the \nwrath of Merit’s representative the following week be\xad\ncause you have failed to “exchange your linens every \nweek—soiled or not.”\nThe exchange of linens requires other exactness,, too. \nFor example, be sure the pieces of your “unit” are neatly \nfolded and piled in the right order, or they may not be \naccepted by the linen exchange worker. \nHe may even \nshove the whole pile on the floor and grunt something-to \nyou about refolding them.\nIt used to be so convenient to have linens delivered to \nyour room each week. But now, students not only have \nto carry their soiled linens to an exchange point, but they \nalso run the risk of having their “unit” stolen.

In this short article I shall try to ex\xad\nplain why I like to go to football games and plays. I shall also men\xad\ntion some of those sports and other events of a social nature which \nthose in “my world” like to attend and in which we sometimes even \nparticipate.\nEver since I can remember, I have always enjoyed attending \nbaseball games, football games, or the like, for I can sometimes enjoy \nthese events even more than some of my friends. \nIf the game is \nbroadcast, I usually carry a- radio to save the person with me much \ntalking, since he will not have to do as much describing to me. \nHowever, I often attend wrestling matches or ball games without \neither a radio or a talkative companion.\nI find it quite exciting to sense the emotions which spread \nthrough the stands as the game unfolds before those who are watch\xad\ning. \nI am sure that you feel some sort of an emotional effect on \nhearing the band strike up a march number, or on hearing a cheer \nswelling in intensity throughout the stands. Not seeing what is ac\xad\ntually going on down there on the field, leaves a lot of room for \nimagination.\nSometimes, however, my imagination will get a little ambitious \nand suddenly be halted by the commentary on the radio, or by some\xad\none sitting near me. For example, while describing a play the radio \nannouncer will often exaggerate what is actually occurring. He may \nsay that there just has been a magnificent run. \nI’ll imagine a gain \nof many yards. \nThen all of a sudden the announced will say that \nthe gain was for only a couple of yards.\nThe best example to illustrate the point that there need not be \nanyone to describe What is occuring, is to tell you about a typical \nwrestling match at the school I attended. Naturally most all of the \naudience can not see what is going on out on the mat. Even if some\xad\none is there to describe what is happening, the cheering is so loud \nthat often they can not be heard. Yet everyone enjoys that emotional \nfeeling which is built up during a match. Through just the slightest \nhint of what is occuring, the audience senses what is happening.\nImagination\nThe fact that much is left to the imagination can often be of help \nin enjoying what is happening, whereas you are at times restricted by \nthe fact that you know what is happening.\nFor example, how often have you heard an announcer on a radio \ndescribe something which is overly exaggerated? \nIn so doing he \nbuilds up in the minds of those listening an image which is probably \nquite different from that which is actually happening. \nYou, how\xad\never, seeing what is happening, can not be so easily aroused.\nI guess the best answer to the question “why do you go to a \nfootball game?” is that I find it just as emotionally exciting as you \ndo. and that I can exercise my power of imagination.\nThe same answer would apply to the question “what do you get \nout of going to a movie?” \nAgain I can enjoy myself by trying to \nfollow the plot and imagining what is happening. \nNaturally in a \nshow such as the usual Western type where the main theme is riding \nback and forth across the screen on horseback shooting, I find this\n', 27, 0), (577.4351806640625, 454.9910583496094, 876.201171875, 810.82861328125, 'typé of show rather dull and very hard to follow. I think I am right \nin saying that most of you would also find these shows less interest\xad\ning. Why? \nBecause they are all the same and you know what is \ngoing to happen.\nMajor Sports\nSome of you may wonder what kind of sports and activities the \npeople in “my world” participate in and enjoy.\nThe major sport in which we can participate in on an equal basis \nis wrestling. I do not mean that “fake” wrestling which one can see \nat the eleventh hour of the evening on TV. I know that there are a \nnumber of people on campus who attend high schools which might \nhave wrestled my school. \nWrestling is the big sport because you \nreally do not have to see to participate in it fully.\nWe also swim, do some track events—such as races, jumps, and \nshotput, bowl, play baseball and football, and some sports of our own \ninvention.\nFor the running events in track, the lanes are marked off by \nwires which are used as guides. \nThe runners half hold on to the \nwire as they run. However, most of the good trackmen can run in a \nstraight line without using the wire. The jumps are done the same \nway as you would do them. Naturally there are no running jumps. \nShot-pùtting is performed exactly the same as you do.\nFor bowling sometimes there is a guide rail by which one lines \nhimself up with the alley, but this is not essential. \nI and most of \nmy friends can bowl on a regular alley with no difficulties other than \nhitting the pins.\nBaseball Methods\nWe play baseball slightly different than you. Instead of throw\xad\ning the ball in the air, we roll it along the ground. \nThe batter hits \nthe ball and then starts running for the base. Sometimes the batter \nmay have enough sight to be able to run to the base without assist\xad\nance. However, if this is not the case, than he has a “runner,” that \nis, someone who runs with him to the base. \nThe fielders field the \nball by sound.\nThere was one fellow in my class who had no sight whatsoever, \nbut could run to the bases, field the ball, and peg the ball directly \nwhere it should go.

On \nthe contrary, for counselors are essential in easing the ad\xad\njustment from high school to college. \nThis adjustment \nis becoming increasingly difficult with the “academic \nsqueeze” as yet uneased by proper high school prepara\xad\ntion. Moreover, the men counselors are invaluable in re\xad\ntaining the roofs of Swartz and Kress Halls on weekends. \nThe women counselors lend advice about social situations \nand encourage an academic approach.\nThese ends are appropriate. \nWould that they were \nmerely fulfilled. Instead, counselors serve as built-in tu-. \ntoring services, theme punctuators and quiz kids. They \nrun handy dating bureaus and maintain verbal “dear \nAbby” columns.

Although \nit varies with individuals, we feel that freshman depend\xad\nence upon counselors is merely a reflection of an attitude \npermeating all aspects of Bucknell life.\n-Several years ago, the students rejected an academic \nhonor system because they felt themselves incapable of \nhandling the responsibility of individual honesty on ex\xad\naminations. \nSince then, the cheating problem has in\xad\ncreased in scope and seriousness. Thus, we have foisted \nonto professors a responsibility which is ours.\nLast year, the women students dissolved their social \nhonor system, having proved that they were unable to \nlive without falling back on some method of group en\xad\nforcement. Today, they have that enforcement which, in \nmany cases, fails to function properly because council as\xad\nsistants are afraid to accept the duty of reporting another \nwoman’s violation.\nCompulsory attendance at classes, rather than unlimit\xad\ned cuts is another instance of student dependence upon \nenforced regulations. Professors, on the basis of past ex\xad\nperience, do not feel that students are disciplined enough \nto regulate their own class attendance. The fact that the \nadministration requires an attendance record for each \nclass further emphasizes the lack of trust in students.\nThose courses allowing independent study are intoler\xad\nably few. \nFor most students, the nearest approach to \nscholarly research is a surface-scraping term paper con\xad\nsisting of a collection of footnoted quotations.

But the- cus\xad\ntom of kissing under the mistletoe \nooan.es down to us from the mystic \nrites of the primitive British \npriests. \nIn their faraway age, the \nmistletoe, which means “all heal,” \nwas believed to have magic quali\xad\nties—the power to heal disease, \nneutralize poisons, protect its pos\xad\nsessor from witchcraft, and be\xad\nstow fertility on humans and ani\xad\nmals. \nIf a young couple sealed \nih w  betrothal with a kiss under \nthe mistletoe, they would receive \nwonderful blessings and much \ngood luck for the rest of their \nlives.\n•Wassail’ was how they greeted\nanother in Merry Old Eng- \nlaad when toasting with a cup of \nwine. \nIt means to “be whole” or \n“have health,” the answer being \n“drink hail.” The word came to \nmean any liquor in which health \nis toasted, especially the spiced \ndrinks served as a feature- of \nmedieval Christmas celebrations \nThat Yule Log blazing on the \nhearth looks simple and provides \na wealth of warmth, but the an\xad\ncients were more concerned with \nits mystical associations than its \npracticality. The custom was first \npracticed by pagans in Scandina\xad\nvia, where a huge log was set on \nAre in honor of Thor, to mark his \nfestival at the time of the winter \nsolstice. In many parts of Europe \nthe dragging home of the Yule \nLeg is still one of the big events \nof the year and a source of great \nexcitement, especially to the chil\xad\ndren.\nWe modems envision Santa \nCSaose as a paunchy gent, but in \nolden times he was a complex \nsymbol and many things to many \npeople. Santa descends from the \noriginal Saint Nicholas, a kindly \nman who lived in Patara, Turkey, \nand died a martyr in 342 A. D., \nbeonring the patron saint of chil\xad\ndren.\nThe cult of St. Nicholas spread \nasra» Europe. \nHe became the \npatron saint of Greece, Holland, \nand Belgium. \nMerchant sailors \nsaed his three golden «purses as a \ndevice on their guild flags. The \nRussians passed the good saint to \ntie  Scandinavians, at which time \nlie was still mounted on a white \nhorse according to an old tradition \nof Turkey. \n^ut the Scandinav\xad\nians knew nothing of horses, so \nthey gave him a reindeer-drawn \npV«gVv \nThey also grafted to him \nthe legend of the Norse God, \nThor, who used to ride through \nthe sky in a chariot, and would \nappear in a red coat for the pagah \nfeast of Yule.\nIn the New World, the Dutch \ncalled \nSaint \nNicholas \n“Santa \nClaus” for short. \nOur modem \nconception of him comes from the \nfamous poem, The Night Before \nChristmas. Dr. Clement C. Moore, \na Presbyterian divinity professor \nIn New York State, wrote it to \nplease his children, and modelled \n« . p hero after a little old wizened \nDutch gentleman he bumped into \none night in 1822—a man with red \ncheeks and white hair, smoking \nan old clay pipe. Dr. Moore read \nthe po°m to his delighted chil\xad\ndren, then threw it in the waste\xad\nbasket. \nA lady visitor fished it \nout and printed it a year later in \nthe Troy, New York Sentinel.

The information, naturally, was the same as is given in any I \nbiology course of a high school level. Of course, there was one major j \ndifficulty; the book which we used was so old that the teacher hadj \nto make use of supplementary material in order to keep the course i \nup to date.\nSince it cost so much to put a book in Braille, the same book may j \nbe used year after year. In the case of the science departments, they ■ \nare usually the last to receive new books. I hope that someday some-1 \none will figure out a way in which books can be produced more \ncheaply and so enable such schools to have books which are up to \ndate.\nDid Experiments\n1 especially enjoyed the experiments and specimens which we \nhad to do and to examine both in biology and physics. \nThe teacher \nwould let us do as much of the experiments as was permissible with\xad\nout putting us into danger. \nIf an experiment involved acids, we \nwould do them, but the teacher would handle them.\nWe were fortunate in having a complete skeleton which we could \nexamine. \nEach of us learned all the bones and could point them out \nwhen asked to do so. Every so often we would decide that the skele\xad\nton was not receiving enough education inside the closet. \nSo v\n', 70, 0), (1386.575439453125, 451.1532287597656, 1688.231689453125, 835.7467041015625, 'would find some old clothes, dress him (or is a skeleton neuter?) and \nsit him at one of the desks with a book before him.\nOne day we did this and put the skeleton in a desk in the comer \nof the room with his face covered. During the course of the discus\xad\nsion, the teacher called on our friend but did not receive an answer \nfrom him. \nHe was quite surprised when upon walking to the back \nof the room he discovered Mr. Bones sitting quietly absorbing all the \ninformation.\nOverbrook’s campus is fortunate in having many rarer plants \nwhich have all been labeled in Braille. \nWe would often take field \ntrips and try to identify these plants and trees without looking at 4he \nsigns. There were also bamboo, English boxwood, all sorts of roses, \nand many more interesting plants,in the “cloister gardens”. \n(The \nschool is constructed in the form of an old Spanish Monastery).\nI also found physics class very interesting. There were only six \nof us in the class. \nWe had two boys who could see quite well, and \nso were able to do many more experiments than former classes.\nThere were various motors which we would take apart and re\xad\nbuild. There was a model of how atoms are constructed. We had \napparatus for distilling and an apparatus for separating ^elements. \nOne day the teacher set up the apparatus to make hydrogen. \nHe \nwould fill a glass and then drop a match into it. After the explosion, \nwe could feel the water which had been produced inside the glass.\nElectric Machines\nWhen we were discussing electricity, we made use of the electro\xad\nstatic machine. We enjoyed the “charges” we gift out of the experi\xad\nments which were performed with this machine.\nTo demonstrate how a lightning rod works, we constructed a \ncardboard house which we would place in the electro-static machine. \nWe would use a bit of inflammable substance to soak the roof of the \nhouse and then see what would happen when the machine discharg\xad\ned. \nNaturally, with no lightning rod, the house would catch fire. \nOh, the teacher was there with extinguisher in hand. \nWe would \nthen add the lightning rod and repeat the process.\nOne remark made by the teacher which we all enjoyed would be \nthis: We would be doing an experiment in which water would be \nused. \nOften he wished to demonstrate that the water would be di\xad\nminished or increased during the experiment. \nHe could easily show \nthis by adding a coloring substance to the water. \nWhen he did so \nhe would often remark: “and now we’ll add a little coloring so that \n(Continued on Page 8)\n', 71, 0), (1150.165283203125, 1217.6341552734375, 1641.03125, 1240.6341552734375, '“FIND THE ANSWER, JIM—AND BRING IT BACK\n', 72, 0), (1640.5052490234375, 1211.2467041015625, 1647.4327392578125, 1219.7467041015625, 'i*\n', 73, 0), (965.59521484375, 1517.744873046875, 1100.208251953125, 1583.34375, 'Classes Resume January 4 \nBturfpnfs are reminded that \nclasses will resume after vaca\xad\ntion at 8 a« nu on Wed., Jan. 4. \ncontrary to the information \nprinted in the Bucknell cata\xad\nlogue.\n', 74, 0), (1169.836181640625, 1257.51416015625, 1394.0130615234375, 1339.26416015625, 'When Jim Boardman took his B.S. in Elec\xad\ntrical Engineering at Colorado State, there was \none idea uppermost in his mind.

We must remember that the university exists \nfor us and not visa-versa, and it is with us that the responsibility lies\nfor its well-being. \n,\nUnfortunately this has not been the case with Bucknell. Anyone \nwho has disagreed with university law has been termed a “smart- \naleck” or “wise-guy” and refused support; so, many laws which \nwould have been discarded decades ago at Harvard or Princeton are \nstill in effect here.\' The administration should not be blamed since \nit is primarily a monetary organization which by nature doesn’t ob\xad\nject to any method that increases revenue.\nLet us take an isolated example of University law and investi\xad\ngate its logic. A friend of mine brought his automobile to Lewisburg \nbetween Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations, and parked it down\xad\ntown off University property. \nA  week later, a Lewisburg police\xad\nman noticed his out-of-town plates and the absence of a University \nparking sticker, stopped him, took his name and reported it to the \nUniversity police. \nA  few days later, my friend received notice of a \n$50 fine. It was that simple.\nThe University insists that every student who operates a vehicle \nat Bucknell is required to obtain a parking sticker for the fee of $20; \na quite reasonable law since the school maintains a parking tot and \ncampus roads at its own expense. \nTherefore the premise is that \nsince students use University facilities, they should pay for them— \nquite right. But in my friend’s case, he did not use University road \nand parking facilities; he kept his car downtown. Therefore, theo\xad\nretically, he should have to pay neither registration nor fine (And \nwhat a fine! \nA small fortune to the student who can work only three \nmonths out of the year.)\nYet the Administration would argue that without the deterrent \nof registration fee and fine, Lewisburg would be overrun with stu\xad\ndent vehicles. This is a municiple problem which could be resolved \nin much the same way as Bucknell and a hundred other colleges have \nsolved their problem, and is beside the question anyway. \nIf, how\xad\never, they insist upon this point, the law should be changed to read \nas follows: "Any student who operates a vehicle at Bucknell and in\xad\ntends to use the facilities provided must pay the required fee. and \nany student-owned vehicle apprehended on any University-owned \nproperty without said sticker shall be subject to fine." \nThis would \nbe a sensible and honest phrasing.\n.(Continued on Page 8)\n', 49, 0), (123.60089111328125, 1708.22705078125, 164.42288208007812, 1744.195068359375, 'mSS \nIH\n', 50, 0), (168.7008819580078, 1750.071044921875, 179.12789916992188, 1758.571044921875, '. ■\n', 51, 0), (354.70086669921875, 1625.7393798828125, 415.4328918457031, 1659.7393798828125, 'mm\n', 52, 0), (203.50086975097656, 1673.5185546875, 245.1008758544922, 1693.5185546875, 'H H\n', 53, 0), (203.75086975097656, 1631.7314453125, 359.828857421875, 1707.7852783203125, "■f e : - . .

Many Phoenix folks, on the other hand, \nhave never seen a frostbite.\nThere are, of course, certain difficulties attending a municipal \nshift of this size. For instance, to move Chicago you also have \nto move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents no great prob\xad\nlem, what with modem scientific advances like electronics and \nthe French cuff. But if you will look at your map, you will find' \nthat Lake Michigan is connected to all the other Great Lakes, \nwhich in turn are connected to the St. Lawrence Seaway, which\nC«AMPUS\nLEVIN#!

After spending several \ndays in Rangoon visiting a good friend who formerly had been to my \nhome while studying in America, I went to Muse and Namkham on \nthe Chinese border. \nMy friend pr. A1 Lun met the bus* at Muse, \nwhich is a very small village only 19 miles from Namkham, where \nDr. Seagrave, the “Buripa Surgeon,” works. \nDr. A i Lun showed \nslides from his visit to America, and there was much to discuss. \nHis \nson drove me to Namkham by jeep, and it was a thrill to meet Dr. \nSeagrave for the first tiftie.\nHe was playing baseball with the nurses when I arrived. \nHe \nappeared an old man, head bent low, with white hair, and walking \nwith effort. \nWe played side by side for the rest of the game as he \ndescribed the hospital and school of nursing, the great medical needs \nof his area, and the character of girls whom he teaches. \nThere are \n240 patients and almost 90 girls in training but only one other doctor \nto help him, an unbelievable work load. \nFor the next ten days \nwas to have the privilege of dining and working beside him.\nOur day began at eight with chapel to which all the girls were | \ninvited, Christian and Buddhist. \nEach morning they read about a \nchapter from the Bible, reading together aloud in a musical sing-song \nBurmese. \nThe Hospital is not a mission hospital, but the kindness! \nand concern, the love which is there translated into action makes it j \nstill a dynamic focus of Christianity in Burma. \nThroughout the! \ncountry Dr. Seagrave is known as the ‘‘grand old man,” and it was I \nthe Burmese people themselves who rose to defend and clear him of \nall false charges during his trial for treason in 1950. \nThe effects of I \nhis imprisonment during this time, however, are still visible, for it? \nwas a tremendous drain upon his body and spirit.\nDr. Seagrave taught for four hours each morning. \nI would ad\xad\nmit, examine, and prescribe for the morning outpatients and new \nadmissions, usually eight in number. \nWhen the Indian physician \nthere started surgery, I joined him to assist on the major cases or \nhandle the minor myself. \nIt was a valuable experience in minor \nsurgery to open abscesses, debride carbuncles, remove bullets, and \nassist with superficial lipomas and tonsillectomys. \nI removed one j z \ntonsil myself and assisted with -the removal of a huge ovarian cvst \non a patient whom I had admitted and diagnosed.\nThough Namkham is at an altitude of 3000 feet and has a very \npleasant climate, it is still customary to sleep each afternoon. \nDr. \nSeagrave was forced to live on a strict schedule to conserve his en\xad\nergy. \nWe parted after lunch and I usually studied in the hospital \noffice until coffee time at four-thirty. \nThen began the clinic work \nwith outpatients and the daily review of inpatient progress. \nSince \nDr. Seagrave is unable to walk for ward rounds, the tiny Burmese \nnurses get four to a stretcher and carry the patients down to his office.\nThere we worked side by side, he translating the history while \nI examined the patient and quickly did a brief physical on the heart, \nlungs and abdomen. \nI was fortunate enough to pick up an empyema \nwhich had been missed on admission on a child, and Dr. Seagrave \nsoon said he trusted my ears as well as his own and discontinued \nchecking my findings unless I requested his opinion.\nAt first we discussed the various interesting points of diagnosis \nand therapy so much that it slowed his work. He is a natural teacher \nand can hardly keep himself from sharing knowledge or swapping \nstories, and I saw many new things to question him about. \nBut soon \nwe- learned to discipline our own conversation and worked together \nefficiently as a team. This was a wonderful thing for ,me.\nIn a very few  days I grew in efficiency and speed as well as con-, \nfidence. \nIt was my first chance to do my own therapy with drugs j \nand to perform minor surgery. \nI saw conditions for the first time— \n¡scurvy, typhoid, cerebral malaria, hookworm, and ascariasis. \nDr. j \nSeagrave expressed the wish that I could stay to assist with th e! \nwork, and it was with deep regret that I left at the end of ten days! \nto return via Muse to Rangoon.\nFrom Calcutta I continued on by train day and night, stopping i \nonly in Delhi a few hours fo ra  visa enroute to Amritsar. \nThere for \nthe second time I visited the beautiful Golden Temple of the Sikh \nreligion, and slept outside on the roof of a temple inn, comfortable I \non a string bed with my mattress, and entranced by the warm beauty j \nof the Indian night and misty face of the moon over Hindu temples, j \nI crossed the border into Pakistan by. foot, went on local bus to ] \nLahore, and then by train for two days to Quetta, 6000 feet high on [ \nthe Baluchistani desert.\nIt was a disappointment to learn in Quetta that the weekly train i \nto Zahidan in Persia had just left, for I was racing across the Middle] \nEast (as fast as one cap race by bus and train in the desert) in order | \nto reach Sweden and have time with my friend before sailing for j \nhome on Agust 10.\nBut my frustration turned to appreciation. when I came to know | \nDr.. Ronald Holland, a Royal College surgeon and eye specialist work-1 \ning at the Mission Hospital there. \nI spent three days watching and j \nassisting him at operations, making walking rounds, working in th e! \noutpatient department and talking about the medical problems of the | \ndesert peoples. \nHe is the most distinguished eye man in that part of \nthe. world and each year holds a six-week clinic in the southern part \\ \nof the country to which two American ophthalmologists are invited' \nfor training.\nTogether they do 2000 eye operations, over 50 a day, mostly for j \ncataract. \nDuring my brief stay, I observed more than a dozen o f! \nthes^e. \nWithout complications, it is a simple procedure. \nWith them, j \none must be an expert. \nDr. Holland takes less than two minutes! \nonce the patient is properly prepared. I wondered whether a general' \nphysician working, say, in Burma would be able to do such work I \nwithout specializing in ophthalmology. \nIt seemed as if the blind! \nhad nothing to lose and everything to gain from an attempt at oper\xad\nation, even if the surgeon is not an expert.\nContinuing on by train, bus* and truck, I reached Belgrade, Yugo-\n", 18, 0), (757.683837890625, 354.1521301269531, 887.1318359375, 362.1521301269531, 'FRID AY, FEBRUARY 3, 1961.\n', 19, 0), (739.8848266601562, 384.3550109863281, 866.90283203125, 438.2673034667969, '¡Skiers Frolic \nAt Whiteface\n', 20, 0), (443.98565673828125, 445.6011047363281, 891.4940185546875, 754.7982177734375, 'by Patty Brown\nI \n“What \na \nwonderful \nweek,”\n! agreed 47 Bucknellian skiers after \nspending the mid-semester holi\xad\nday in Lake Placid skiing the \nAdirondacs.\n“Is this a ski clftb or a ,survival \nunit?” wondered the same group \nupon braving 15 below 0“ windy \nweather.

On this day Crimscott had a football game \nscheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football was, \nof course, something of a problem at Crimscott, what with only \nfour students enrolled in the entire college. It was easy enough \nto muster a backfield, but finding a good line—or even a bad \nline—baffled the most resourceful coaching minds in the country.\nWell sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota, \nits traditional rival, a capricious destiny dealt Crimscott a cruel \nblow—in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback, \nwoke up that morning with the breakbone fever. Wrichards, the \nslotback, was unable to start his motorcycle. Beerbohm-Tree, \nthe wingback-tailback. got his necktie caught in his espresso \nmachine.

Crimscott was so out of sorts that they immedi\xad\nately broke off football relations with Minnesota, its traditional \nrival.

But the key word \nhere is “hit”; they could hit that \nupper register, but they could not \nplay there. \nFor whereas with \nothers, such high notes were \nfreakish—squeals to be reached \nand skidded over and then drop\xad\nped—Maynard was able to work \ncomfortably and accurately at \nthat register. \nThe Kenton band \nhad parts written especially for \n, Maynard, because no one else \ncould play them.\n", 13, 0), (270.68280029296875, 444.6488952636719, 433.1357116699219, 1035.0240478515625, "j \nOne of the memorable sights \ni in jazz was to see Maynard, with \n!

For \ndessert I will have melon stuffed with money.”\n“ And you, Sir?” said the waiter to Finster.\n“ Just bring me a pack of Marlboros,” replied Finster, “for \nif ever a man needed to settle back and enjoy the mild benefi\xad\ncence of choice tobacco and easy-drawing filtration, it is the \nshattered hulk you see before you now.”\nSo, smoking the best of all possible cigarettes, Finster watched \nKretchma ingest her meal and calculated that every time her \nfetching young Adam's apple rose and fell, he was out another \n97(i. Then he took her home.\nIt was while saying goodnight that Finster got his brilliant \nidea. “ Listen!” he cried excitedly. “ I just had a wonderful \nnotion. Next time we go out, let’s go Dutch treat!”\nBy way of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with \nher housemother and stormed into the house.\n“ Well, the heck with her,”  said Finster to himself. “ She is \njust a gold digger and I am well rid of her. I am sure there are \nmany girls just as beautiful as Kretchma who will understand \nthe justice of my position. For after all, girls get as much \nmoney from home as men, so what could be more fair than \nsharing expenses on a date?”\nWith good heart and high hopes, Finster began a search for \na girl who would appreciate the equity of Dutch treat, and you \nwill be pleased to hear that he soon found one—Mary Alice \nHematoma, a lovely three-legged girl with sideburns.\n©  1961 Max Sbulman\n*  - \n*  \n*\n",

In order to do | \nthis, they do try to get the best \nmen they can to come to Buck\xad\nnell. \nI very seriously doubt that, | \nif a coach wanted a particular I \nvery good athlete who happened j \nto be a Negro to play on his team, \nwould refuse to bring him here, I \njust because of the social difficul\xad\nties he might face. \nI have been \non the swimming team for four \nyears now. \nGranted, I am tired \narid worn out when I leave prac\xad\ntice. \nBut I am not more tired! \nthan my teammates, solely be- j \ncause I have to bear some addi-1 \ntional pressure imposed upon me j \nbecause of my race as stated by \nMr. Zeller.\nThe social situation has always j \nand will always be a touchy sub- 1  \nject in most interracial relations. I \nNo matter where one looks, on \ncampus or off, people will be \nfound to fit into three classes in j \ntheir \nrelation \nwith \nminority j \ngroups. There are those who truly | \naccept all people as equals; those j \nwho go to extremes to demon- j \nstrate their liberalism; and also j \nthose \nwho won’t even speak. I \nBucknell isn’t unique in having j \nthese types of people, and most \nNegroes will not be suprised to ! \nfind them here.\nMany Bucknellians might ask \nwhy would Negroes want to come j \nto a school like Bucknell with all \nits limitation's. \nWell I’ve been \nclosely associated with many dif- j \nferent colleges. I spent a semes- \nter At \nHoward \nUniversity \nin j \nWashington, D. C. and I’ve known j \nstudents at Syracuse U. for four | \nyears. \nMy sister has attended j \nFisk \nUniversity \nin \nNashville, j \nTenn., Oberlin College as an ex- j \nchange student and now Univer\xad\nsity of Michigan. \nAt each one of \nthese schools students have com\xad\nplaints about the social life. \nThe \ngrass is not always greener.\nHere at Bucknell I know stu- 1 \ndents who have left, because the \nsocial life has not been to their \nliking. \nAnd just think, Bucknell \nis supposed to be one of the best \nschools for “catching a mate” . , \nEven with this ideal mating situ- 1 \nation many Bucknellians do not \ntake advantage of it and go \nthrough four years pinned off \ncampus. \nSo it would be foolish \nfor any mature person to base his \nselection of a college solely on its \nsocial acceptability. Furthermore \nnearly every Negro student ex\xad\npects that in an interracial society \nthere will be inconsistencies. It’s \nwhat you make out of what you \nhave where you have it that \ncounts. \nThose who can overlook \nprejudice and ignorance can see \na pleasant life.\nYes. I do agree with calling for \na \nfavorable \nsocial \nclimate \nin \nwhich the new African s.tudent \n, may live next year. \nIt must be \nremembered that Africans are \nproud of their color, their race, \ntheir nationality and have never \nfelt \nthat \nblackness \ndeserved \nseecnd-rate treatment. \nWhereas \nmost American Negroes are cal\xad\nloused to the inconsistencies in \nour society, Africans are not.\nThis African fellow will be \nsoon living in a new society and \nasking many questions about the \nsociety. \nHe will recall in his \nmind that in the society outside \nthis campus -the Negro population \nis 10%. \nIn cur society on cam\xad\n", 17, 0), (286.5204772949219, 371.5016174316406, 435.2959289550781, 664.3995361328125, 'pus it is presently 0.1%.

The Bucknellian did send a re\xad\nporter to the admissions office last year, he was refused \nthe pertinent information on the basis that it was confi\xad\ndential.\nMr. Zeller made the point in his letter that there is no \nUniversity policy toward Negroes concerning admissions. \nWe sincerely hope that this statement doesn’t imply that \nthere are policies toward other racial or religious groups. \nThe letter argued that there simply aren’t enough “fiinan- \ncially able Negroes to go around.” \nHowever, investiga\xad\ntion shows that the Betty Ann Quinn Scholarship, which \ncontrary to Mr. Zeller’s letter is specifically for Negroes, \nis not being used at this time.\nThe letter made a valid point in its statement as to why \nthere are so few, indeed no, Negro athletes at Bucknell \nHowever a boy by the name of Irwin Roberson who won \na silver medal for the United States in the recent Olym\xad\npics, applied for admission to Bucknell four years ago; he \nwas in the top quarter of his class, and a star football \nplayer and trackman. \nHe is a Negro; he wanted to come \nto Bucknell; he was denied admission.

Also, the soeiaL opportunities for Jews, Catholics, \nKoreans, Burmese and other non-Anglo-Saxon Protestants \nare really not much better. Yet each of these groups is \nrepresented on the Bucknell campus. \nNow it seems, to \nus, unfair to subject these groups to a narrow social life,, \nwhile saving the Negro student from it. \nThere appears \nto be something wrong with Mr. Zeller’s reasoning on this \npoint.\nWe do agree with Mr. Zeller that the absence of a pho\xad\ntograph from the application will not take prejudice out \nof people’s hearts, but it certainly would be a step toward \nattracting more Negro applicants, which Mr. Zeller agrees \nwould be a more desirable goal than having them scared \naway by the picture requirentent.\nAccording to Mr. Zeller’s letter we have been “beating \nthe director of admissions.” We are extremely sorry if we \ngave this impression. \nThe Bucknellian is quite aware \nthat Mr. Walling and his staff are not in the position of \nbeing directly responsible for admissions policies.

We are happy \nto recognize, as a result of figures released last week, that \nthis charge is completely unfounded.\nMoreover, a check of scholarship records shows that the \nBetty Ann Quinn scholarship mentioned in last week’s \neditorial has been awarded to a Negro student every se\xad\nmester for the past five years. At present, it is not being \nused because its recipient withdrew at the end of the first \nsemester.\nIn addition, a check of applications shows that Irwin \nRoberson, the star athlete described in last week’s edi\xad\ntorial, did not apply to Bucknell. \nIt is thought that he \nwas interested in this school and may have been ap\xad\nproached by the athletic department, but no facts are \navailable to corroborate this rumor.\nA clarification of these statements by no means closes \nthe issue; if anything, it should make us more aware of \nthe problems at stake. \nAs we see it, the question of dis\xad\ncrimination is two-fold. \n(1) To encourage more Negroes \nto apply to Bucknell, two steps may be taken: the picture \nnow requested on the application could be eliminated, and \npictures requested only after the applicant has applied \nfor admission. Secondly, the admissions team might make \nmore of an effort to seek out qualified Negroes in their in\xad\nterviewing. \n*\n(2) To make the social climate amenable to Negroes, \nstudents must evidence a desire for real understanding of \nand friendship with those of other races.

The quality of both courses and professors \nhas improved considerably. I think most students will \nacknowledge the successful efforts by the administration \nto make Bucknell wprthy of calling itself an “institution \nof higher learning.” I feel, however, that the administra- \nI \ntion has overlooked one very important fact.\nIncoming freshmen are not aware of this academic re\xad\nform program; and, under the present system, the only \nway they can find out is to go through the rigors of their \nj \nfirst stemester. Unfortunately, some freshmen experience \nmore difficulty than others because they sigh up fpr the \nwrong courses, plan an unbalanced schedule, or take too \nmany courses in one semester that involve extensive read- \n! \ning or writing.\nActually, the difficulty these people experience is unnec\xad\nessary. The situation can be remedied if the administra\xad\ntion, along with its other reforms, will provide counseling \nfor freshmen before they sign up for courses and before \nthey arrive on campus in September. Right now the only- \n“counselor” available to a high school senior, who has \n! \nbeen accepted by Bucknell, is the catalogue. An incom- \nI \ning freshman must select his first semester courses, mak- \n1 \ning his decisions solely on what he learns from the cata\xad\nlogue. .

But \nthe reason for the foreign advant\xad\nage is not what he had anticipat\xad\ned.\n“Until I got on the inside,” he \nsaid, “I thought they had us lick\xad\ned over here because of wage \nrates. \nI know differently now. \nFor every penny they’re saving in \ndirect labor costs, they’ve got us \nwhipped by three cents in gen- I \neral overhead. \nInside the plant, \nit’s about a standoff—but when \nyou get to the office, they make | \nus look like fools.”\nHis company and this European 1 \nfirm are about the same size in \nterms of units of production. The i \nAmerican \ncompany \nhas \nabout I \n1200 hourly workers in its plant, \nthe overseas factory 1300. \nBut | \nin terms of salaried employes, it’s j \na different story—912 in America \nversus 221 in Europe. There’s a \nclue to our basic disadvantage in \nforeign competition today. Here \nin the United States we have the \nmost expensive industrial m an-, \nagement on earth.\nIt starts right at the top. The j \nAmerican firm mentioned has an j \nactive chairman of the board, a \npresident, five vice presidents, and I \nan executive staff of 42 people. \nThe European firm is run by a I \nmanaging director and one key I \nassistant. \nThe top-management | \nstaff totals only nine. \nThe con\xad\ntrast continues right down the \nline. \n“They could pay our wage | \nrates,” the American president \nsaid, “and we still couldn’t com\xad\npete—our overhead would lick us \nhands down.”\n“If you know the answer, why \ndon’t you go home with a big ax} \nand chop yourelf down to size?” j \nI asked. \nHis reply pretty well \ndefined the problem: “How can \nI? \nEven if I were capable of \nrunning our company as a one- \nman show—which is virtually | \nwhat’s happening over here—I’m ] \nnot at all certain that I could get \naway with it as far as our organi- | \nzation is concerned. \nOur second- j \n1 level executives \nhaven’t \nbeen \ntrained to take over in the way | \nthese European boys have.” \nFin\xad\nally, almost to himself, he added, \n“I wonder how we got so far off \nthe beam?”\nOne Explanation \nI have a theory that may be at I \nleast partially applicable. \nThis ! \nman, like so many other corpora- j \nlion heads today, is now in his! \nmiddle 50’s. That means he spent I \nhis formative years during the j \nDepression, as I did, when busi\xad\nness leaders were being violently \nattacked as enemies of society— \ngreedy, grasping, dictatorial, anti- j \nsocial. \nNot all these politically \ninspired charges were true by any \nmeans, but the rising young busi-1 \nnessman of that day saw enough \ntruth in some of them to cause I \nhim to decide that when he got \nto the top. he was going to be i \ndifferent. \nBefore long, we found j\n', 4, 0), (280.764892578125, 423.5753479003906, 429.5230407714844, 835.271484375, 'a word to characterize that differ\xad\nence: “enlightened.”\nAt first “enlightenment” meant \nonly a heightened social con\xad\nscience. \nFairly quickly, however, \nthe definition was broadened to \nimply a businessman who was, in \nall particulars, the opposite of \nwhat the old-style businessman \nwas charged with being. \nIf the \nOld Man was distatorial and auto\xad\ncratic, we enlightened business\xad\nmen would bring democracy into \nthe world of business. \nWe would \nend one-man rule. \nWe would \nemploy group thinking. \nThus, \nthe committee system of opera\xad\ntion came into being—and the top \nexecutive became a sort of super \ncommittee chairman.\nAgain, if the Old Man’s weak\xad\nness was in handling people, that \nwas where the new man would \nbe strong.

This laissez-faire attitude is one reason why other institutions of \nI higher learning have remained static, when in reality they should \nhave been thriving, dynamic bodies. \nThus my first aim will be to \nawaken the student body to their responsibilities as members of the \nI Bucknell society, and to make them keenly aware that as good an \nI institution as Bucknell is, it certainly is not beyond reproach or above \nI revision.\nMinority Groups\nMy second aim will' be to further the advancement of the minor\xad\nity groups on campus. \nBy this I do not simply mean only race or \nreligious groups, but also the independent men and women, who most \ncertainly1 represent aft important segment of our campus.\nMy third aim will be to re-establish the Student-Faculty Con\xad\ngress ts the supreme governing body of the University, and to elevate \nit from the subservient position to which I fear it has slipped, due \nto the overly-emphasized role which our “social institutions” have \ncome to play. \nThis will necessarily mean a concentration of power \nin the supreme governing body and a lessening of concentration in \nall of the other branches of student government.\nThis is not to say that such groups as the IFC, MSG, or WSGA \nwill become stagnant organizations devoid of power, but that their \npower will come from the SFC and will be curtailed by them if such \noccasions should arise.\nLastly, but certainly not the least important of my aims, will be \nan emphasis on the main purpose of the University, the intellectual \nstimulation of its students. \nI would attempt to fulfill this aim \nthrough one or both of two methods. \nFirst, by programs conducive \nto the stimulation of intellectual curiosity and interest, and second a \npossible revision of our present curriculum and semester plans at \nBucknell. \nThis would entail a lessening of the work load on both \nstudents and teachers, and thus allow more time for cpncentrated \nstudy leading towards positive achievement.\nStudent Contributions\nThe part which the students can play in this overall picture is \ngreat. \nSince, essentially, you are the government, a basic stand on \nvarious issues should be taken. \nMake known your views. \nBe ex\xad\npressive rather than complacive. \nBe alive instead of dormant. And \nrealize most of all that what you do not say will not be realized, but \nwhat you speak out about will be heard. \nA  dynamic student body, \none which is sincerely interested in making Bucknell a better institu\xad\ntion, and one which takes positive, strides towards the procurement \nof ideas, will bp the student body that will get results.\nI ask you to think carefully about what has been said, seek Im\xad\nprovement for what you consider lacking, and take an active part in \nyour student government.

One needs only \nto look at the combination of tal\xad\nents used in the making of it to \nknow he is going to see some\xad\nthing different. \nBut what does \none find here? Only a story about \nordinary human beings, all hav\xad\ning faults and virtues; this is the \nmajor problem. We have become \nso used to seeing stereotyped \ncharacters and situations on the \nscreen that when “the misfits” \ncome along, it is difficult to ac\xad\ncustom oneself to them.\nIf the power of The Misfits had \nto be attributed to a single force, \nthis force would be the words of \nArthur Miller, for he has some\xad\nthing important to say.

In the past, Mr. Idzerda stated, \nthe function of the artist was to \ncreate the ethos of a society, to \ngive significance and form to life, \nj and to enlarge experience- Gea- \n! erally the artist held a position of \n¡honor and found patrons among \nj the ruling class, as in the age of \nPericles, the Medici, and Louis \nXIV.\nDuring the last two centuries, \nhowever, “the words ‘artist’ and \n‘alienation* have become synony\xad\nmous.” \nThe artist is generally \ncharacterized by such terms as \n»poor, eccentric, and of low mor\xad\nality. The essence of his aliena\xad\ntion lies in the fact that he must \nstruggle to maintain the integrity \nof his work, and that he frequent\xad\nly lowers his * standards or \nnounces art entirely.\nFour Causes\n| \nDr. Idzerda cited four main \n' causes of this alienation. \nThe \nfirst was the rapid growth of \nscience and its application to \ntechnology. \nThe analytic char\xad\nacter of science, as well as its \n“naive rationalism and naive em\xad\npiricism,” creates an atmosphere \nhostile to art, which is essentially \nunanalytic, ineffable, and intang\xad\nible. \nMoreover, scientific devel\xad\nopment encourages specialization \nof functions and division of labor \nand the artist or craftsman be\xad\ncomes “antiquarian, \nor merely \ncute.”\nA second cause cited by Mr. \nIdzerda was the rise of the middle \nclass.

Thank you for \nyour comments and also for your articles.\nI thought I would devote this article to the reasons for my com\xad\ning to Bucknell and to my future plans. \nI also hope that, after read\xad\ning this aritcle, some of you may have comments or suggestions to \nmake concerning what I have to say.\nAlmost from the first day in school I had a desire to attend col\xad\nlege and to learn as much as I possibly could. However, it was not \nuntil almost the beginning of my senior year in high school that I \nbegan to have any particular preference as to the college .1 wished \nto attend. I knew that I would prefer to attend a small college where \nI could obtain a good education. \nAttendance at a smaller college \nwould also have the advantage of affording more opportunities to \nmeet people. \nI felt that I would like to attend a college where some\xad\none like me had not recently, or perhaps had never attended. As it \nhappened, Bucknell was to be the place where I would continue my \neducation.\nMath Major\nAll through my secondary education, my major interest was \nmathematics. My father’s work involves mathematics and I guess I \ninherited the interest from him. Mother asserts that her interests \nwere no\\ so inclined. \nI felt that if given the opportunity to continue \nmy education, I would major in mathematics. Thus, I now find my\xad\nself as a mathematics major at Bucknell.\nOne of the major aims of the University is to instill in the stu\xad\ndent a desire to pursue knowledge—truth. Already I have found that \nBucknell offers one such an opportunity to pursue knowledge if one \nso desires. However, I am also aware of the fact that four years is \na rather brief time to spend .in this pursuit. I could very easily add \nan additional four years of courses I would like to take, and perhaps \nwith each new course this number would increase.\nHowever, fortunately or unfortunately, depending upon which \nway one looks at the situation, one must also prepare for future em\xad\nployment after those brief four years. You probably wonder what \nI intend to do?\nTeaching Mathematics\nAt this moment I can see two possibilities for me. \nI would like \nto be able to either teach mathematics, or to work with mathematics \nin industry. \nIf teaching should be my future, I would enjoy teach- j \ning higher mathematics. A few years ago there probably would have | \nbeen some opportunities for a teacher of mathematics iin the various j \nschools for the blind in the United States. However in recent years, \nwith the trend of capable blind students continuing their education I \nin “sighted schools,” there only remains, in many instances, the j \nteaching of elementary math in such schools.\nI believe I would much rather prefer teaching in a normal school j \nif possible. \nI realize that there will be many problems for me in j \nteaching in a public school, but I do not feel that the prospective j \nproblems would find no solutions. \nI have already mentioned in a \nprevious article that there have been blind teachers in the fields of | \nphysics and mathematics, and I should like to have the opportunity I \nto join that number.\nI would be interested in your reactions or comments upon such \nan undertaking. \nPerhaps some of you may have suggestions upon \npossible teaching methods I could use. \nIf so, I would appreciate dis- \ncussing them with you. \nI would also appreciate hearing what your \nreactions might be if you walked into a class to find me, or someone \nlike me, as the teacher.\n. \nStatistical W orker\nThe other .possibility for me in the field of mathematics after j \ngraduation is working as a statistician or in some other mathematic\xad\nally oriented employment. \nThis possibility has just recently been \nmade known to me, and perhaps such employment might prove more \nfeasible than teaching. \nI shall be taking my first statistics course \nnext year, and perhaps after this course I shall be in a better position \nfor evaluating the possibilities of employment.\nAnd thus it stands. Whether I shall become a teacher of mathe\xad\nmatics, or work in industry with mathematics remains for the future \nto reveal.\n', 44, 0), (1249.133544921875, 380.7104797363281, 1500.87353515625, 405.7104797363281, '‘ Chez Tchaikovsky\\ \n', 45, 0), (1249.133544921875, 421.5094299316406, 1549.37353515625, 446.5094299316406, 'Disappoint Solov Ballet \n', 46, 0), (1250.0836181640625, 462.5594787597656, 1535.683349609375, 487.5594787597656, '‘ Orpheus’ Performance\n', 47, 0), (1591.8336181640625, 364.82257080078125, 1761.6375732421875, 405.0084533691406, 'Wmm\nesse\n', 48, 0), (1249.1436767578125, 495.5172424316406, 1397.3985595703125, 721.76416015625, 'by Liz Atkinson\nOn March 9-10 the Bucknell \nUniversity Artist Series brought \nballet to Lewisburg.

Don;t \ndiscount the Hawks.\nBison All-Opponent Team\nOne of the All-Teams that receives little recognition is each \nschool’s All-Opponent squad. \nThe Bisons, despite a 12-11 record, \nplayed a very good schedule this year and faced some of the top ball\xad\nplayers in the country. \nFrom a slate that included Cornell, LaSalle. \nPitt, Temple (N IT entry), St. Joe’s, Westminster, George Wash\xad\nington, Colgate, and Penn State, the Bison squad, selected:\nRon Warner—Gettysburg \nJack Egan— St. Joseph’s \nGene Harris— Penn State \nRon Galbriath—Westminster \nBob McAlteer— LaSalle\nas the 1960-61 all-opponent five. \n,\nAmong those considered were Russ Gordon and Bruce Drysdale \nof Temple, Bob Duffy of Colgate, Norm Brandi of Lehigh, Jon Feld\xad\nman of GW, and John Fridley of Pitt.\n", 11, 0), (583.1988525390625, 450.1636047363281, 740.3130493164062, 935.5065307617188, "by Ted Odenwald \nThe first annual faculty-intra\xad\nmural all-star game turned into a \nfun-filled 32-minute fiasco Tues\xad\nday as the faculty “ won” a 51-50 \ndecision. \nGoing into the final \nquarter, the intramural squad led \n44-29, but with the assistance of \nreferee Mike Fadden and Dick \nKniffen the faculty was able to \nscore a tense come-from-behind \nvctory.\nI \nAssistant Dean of Men, Jerry \nGriffis was the game’s high scor\xad\ner, dumping in 23 points. \n“Griff” \nwas aided mainly by Skip Weider \nwho did a fine job in the forward \nposition. \nThe intramural team’s \nscoring was evenly distributed. \nKen Twiford and Bill Emory each \nscored eight points, leading the \nteam. \nDon Olson, Paul Terhes, j \nand Doug Reed each scored six.\nThe first three quarters were \ncompletely dominated by the in -' \ntramural squad except at certain \npoints when Griffis, Weider, and \nStraiano sunk back-to-back bas- j \nkets for the faculty administration i \nfive.\n'Large' Squad\nA t the beginning of the final j \nstanza, faculty coach Spike Jan- \nnides called for a conference with \nthe referees. \nAfter a brief con\xad\nversation, the game was resumed. \nObviously unknown to the ref\xad\nerees, the faculty now had a seven \nman squad in action. \nWith the \nadded help,, the faculty was able \nto tighten up its defenses and \nprevent the younger team from \nscoring while they cut into the \nstudent’s lead.\nGriff Scores\n1 \nWith only bne second remaining \nin the game, the faculty* trailing \n1 by two points, 50-48, called for a \ntime out. \nAs the ball was put \ninto play it was noticed that the \nclock was not running. \nThe final\n", 12, 0), (731.0479125976562, 447.2666320800781, 884.8075561523438, 770.611572265625, 'I one second of the game lasted \nabout a minute and a half and in \nte closing play of the game, Grif- \nI fis sunk a layup with his back to \n| the basket, and with two oppon- \nI ents hanging from his arms. \nThe \n| buzzer sounded, eding the game, \n¡but Griffis still had a foul shot \n! coming to him. \nThe crowd sat in \nsilent \napprehension \nas \n“Griff”\n1 stepped to the foul line. \nThe si- \n¡ lence was broken by Coach Jan- \nnides’ \ncry, “ Come on Jerry! \nGriffis’ foul shot swished through \nthe net giving the faculty a vic\xad\ntory.\nCoach Jannides commented af\xad\nter the game, “They were^ trying \nto give the game away to us, but \nwe didn’t want to take it.”\nFaculty - Administration\nFG \n9\nGriffis\nWeider\nRiley\nElze\nOberlin\nLatour\nStraiano\nRodgdrs\nTufts\nBemacki\nBly\nTotals\n', 13, 0), (794.8978271484375, 667.611572265625, 831.4658203125, 781.209716796875, '4\n1\n1\n1\no\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n21\nStudents\n', 14, 0), (741.3488159179688, 784.7095947265625, 820.9578247070312, 859.406494140625, 'Twiford, PGD\n4\nUeisner, DU\n1\nPlatz, P K P\n2\nReed, SAE\n3\nAltman, SAM\n1\nEmery, SPE\n4\nZubeckis, KDR\n0\nTerhes, SC\n3\n', 15, 0), (740.1488037109375, 860.0565185546875, 822.1578369140625, 934.8033447265625, 'Cowan, TC\n2\nOlson, Ind.\n3\nGibison, Ind.\n1\ni Pedloe, LC A\n0\n, Neuman, KS\n0\n| Moore, PLT\n0\n!

I say desperate problems call for desperate reme\xad\ndies. I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I say \nwe must do no less than go to school every single day of the \nyear.. But that is not all. I say we must go to school #4 hours \nof every day!\nThe benefits o f such a program are, of course, obvious. First \nof all, the classroom shortage will immediately disappear be\xad\ncause all the dormitories can be converted into classrooms. \nSecond, the teacher shortage will immediately disappear because \nall the night watchmen can be put to work teaching calculus \nand Middle English poetry. And finally, overcrowding will \nimmediately disappear because everyone will quit school.\nAny further questions?\n© 1961 Mmc HRultnaw\n', 43, 0), (614.380859375, 1554.9927978515625, 862.9658813476562, 1586.9925537109375, 'Yes, one further Question: Have you tried Marlboro’s newest \npartner in pleasure— the unaltered, king-site Philip Morris \nCommander?

S. Government or \nthrough private organizations and institutions to help \nforeign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled man\xad\npower.” Unofficially, it is a new adventure designed to \nwin friends for the U.

Before they are selected, \napplicants will bethoroughly interviewed, tested and re\xad\ntested, and specifically trained to serve in a particular area \nand in a particular capacity.\nMembers of the Peace Corps will not have an easy job. \nThis statement needs emphasis. Volunteers may find their \nwork tedious and full of frustration. Their living condi\xad\ntions will probably be poor. They will have to learn to \ncope with the deep distrust of the uninformed. Members \nof the Peace Corps will receive no salary—only an allow\xad\nance which is sufficient to meet their basic needs and to \nmaintain their health. \nFurthermore, service with the \nCorps will not exempt volunteers from Selective Service.\nDespite any of the inherent drawbacks of the Peace \nCorps, its potential worth seems to far outmeasure any \nharm which may result. \nWe have an “exciting genera\xad\ntion” of Americans who are willing and capable to aid \ntheir country and world. It seems only fair to-give these \npeople the training and opportunity to play their full part \nin the world community.\nBecause of the facilities available at Bucknell and the \nlarge number of foreign students enrolled, this University \nhas applied to become a training center for Peace Corps \nvolunteers.

If WVBU truly represents that voice, it would \nbe wise for Bucknell to speak no more!\nNumerous weaknesses qf the radio station are apparent. \nFirst of all, WVBU is designed only for Bucknellians, but \nhow can it be at all effective if,many of the students and \nfaculty, who live on or nearby the campus, are unable to \nreceive its broadcasts clearly? Last year, when the sta\xad\ntion was relocated, there was talk about a new surge of \npower for WVBU broadcasts. \nHowever, more powerful \ntransmitting equipment still remains as WVBU’s basic \n| \nnecessity.\nThis one item, although stimulating WVBU, would fail \nto cure its other ills. \nBeing the student’s radio station, \nWVBU should cater to the students’ interests. To do this, \ni \nradio programming obviously needs to be increasingly \nj \nvaried. \nMany students are interested in music which \ntranscends rock and roll and jazz (especially the former). \nThis situation warrants an increased number of classical \nprograms. \nConcerts and lectures given on the campus \ncould be taped and broadcast. \nThus, students who are \nunable to attend or even those who are desirous of a re\xad\nrun could hear such events.\nWVBU could be used effectively in the area of politics. \nFor example, candidates for various student organizations \ncould speak to outline their plans. \nThis would enable \nmore of the student body to becme acquainted with them. \nSports events, especially away football and basketball \ngames could be broadcast when other local stations do not \ncarry these events. \nAll university-scheduled activities \nshould be announced daily. Finally, interviews, debates, \nand programs similar to the television “College Bowl \nwould enable the students to be stimulated on an academ\xad\nic level.\nMost of these changes would not increase the station’s \nexpenditures; the only need would be for more volunteers \nso that WVBU could operate a revamped program sched\xad\nule effectively.\nBy adapting these revisions, we hope that WVBU will \nemerge from its extended larval stage, and that the re\xad\nsults of this metamorphosis will be desirable.\n', 16, 0), (155.29714965820312, 877.5099487304688, 401.07916259765625, 903.5099487304688, 'Four Percent Straw\n', 17, 0), (141.5972442626953, 911.9720458984375, 422.6011962890625, 1385.73681640625, 'A student revolt against the four percent State sales tax \non textbooks and school supplies is snowballing across \nPennsylvania’s 88 college and university campuses. The \ndrive has reached the proportions of a State-wide lobby\xad\ning campaign aimed at the Pennsylvania legislature.\nTemple University is prodding its students to write to \ntheir local newspapers, telephone their ward leaders, and \nenlist the support of parents in bringing pressure to bear \non State legislators. We believe that SFC, the represen\xad\ntative organ of student government here at Bucknell, \nshould sponsor a similar drive against this tax. The State \nsales tax on textbooks and school supplies is an unneces\xad\nsary financial burden on college students in a period when \ntuition, room and board, and prices of texts and other \nsupplies have been rapidly rising.\nAlthough the tax bite on the individual student is small \n—probably no more than an average of $4 a year—and \nmay not seem to be a heavy burden, neither was the \nstraw that broke the camel’s back! \nThe average under\xad\ngraduate spends between $75 and $100 a year for text\xad\nbooks and supplies. This outlay is compulsory since we \nmust buy books in order to remain in school. Today, ed\xad\nucation is a necessity. However, its price is too high for \nmany students, and the tax on texts aggravates the prob\xad\nlem. Backers of the drive point out that the loss in state \nrevenue would be negligible—one estimate fixes the sum \nat approximately $500,000.\nAlbeit the small additional $4 cost of texts may seem \ninconsequential to most of us, there are some students \nwho are required to work their way through school, and \nthey are the ones who bear the brunt of the unnecessary \ntax levy. It is true that these students are in the minor\xad\nity. Yet, we are faced with a situation where the force \nof the majority could provide enough impetus to succpr \nthe cause of the minority.\nSo far, the campaign initiated by Temple University has \nhad little tangible success.

Why? \nWhy, for example, should a master of library science wear lemon \nyellow?\nWell sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to \nMarch 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the \nUnited States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr. \nSigafoos’s neighbors were of course wildly grateful—ail, that \nis, except Wrex Todhunter.\nMr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both \nmen had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had \nchosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr. \nSigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise \nMambo, the Shay’s Rebellion SchottiSche, and the James K. \nPolk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all \nowing to a ivound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans. \n(He was struck by a falling praline.)\nConsumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos’» \nlibrary, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library. \nThis he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr. \nSigafoos. “What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven’t got?” Mr. \nTodhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to \nhim: books.\nSo Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books \nand soon he was doing more business than his hated rival. \nBut Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began \nserving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There\xad\nupon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea \nwith sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with \nsugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving \ntea with sugar and cream and lemon.\nThis, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be\xad\ncause he had the only lemon tree in town—in fact, in the entire \nstate of North Dakota—and since that day lemon yellow has of \ncourse been the color on the academic robes of library science.\n(Incidentally^ the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library \nand moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There \nwere,, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but, \nalas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced \nto California until 1931 by John Wayne.) \n© IM] Maishuim*»\n', 71, 0), (1423.4288330078125, 1540.5452880859375, 1670.0819091796875, 1575.445068359375, 'And today Californian», happy among their Guernseys and \nHolsteins, are discovering a great new cigarette—the un\xad\naltered, king-size Philip Morris Commander—and so are \nAmericans in all fifty states.

On that date the first.'public library in the \nUnited States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr. \nSigafoos’s neighbors were of course wildly grateful—all, that \nis, except Wrex Todhunter.\nMr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both \nmen had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had \nchosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr. \nSigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise \nMambo, the Shay’s Rebellion Schottische, and the James K. \nPolk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all \nowing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans. \n(He was struck by a falling praline.)\nConsumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos’s \nlibrary, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library. \nThis he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr. \nSigafoos. “What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven’t got?” Mr. \nTodhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to \nhim: books.\nSo Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books \nand soon he was doing more business than his hated rival. \nBut Mn'Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began \nserving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There\xad\nupon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea \nwith sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with \nsugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving \ntea with sugar and cream and lemon.\nThis, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be\xad\ncause he had the only lemon tree in town—in fact, in the entire \nstate of North Dakota—and since that day lemon yellow has of \ncourse been the color on the academic robes of library science.\n(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library \nand moved to California where, alas, he failed once more.

Mr. Jacobson, in making this \nattack, aligns himself with a curi\xad\nous group of people at Bucknell \nwho are unwilling to support cer\xad\ntain artistic and creative attempts \non this campus and, instead, try \nto defeat them by spurious as\xad\nsaults that are in no way related \nto constructive criticism. \nMr. \nJacobson’s critical colors have \nfinally come to the fore, and I \nsincerely hope that your editorial \npolicies will prevent him from \nmaking any similar unwarranted \nattacks in the future.\nMary Linn Grossman\n', 33, 0), (503.02880859375, 1791.2633056640625, 555.5977172851562, 1839.0972900390625, 'n\nf|§\n', 34, 0), (582.6777954101562, 1702.7650146484375, 622.9468994140625, 1777.5645751953125, "¡NHSB3\npfpfï'»r\np i i i *\n; i  i\n■■.V\njjsljpití'v\n¡Élifit\nmm |lj§g\ni l l\n", 35, 0), (710.6278076171875, 1675.90283203125, 736.0598754882812, 1684.40283203125, '1 1 1 1\n', 36, 0), (711.3278198242188, 1717.6646728515625, 754.7492065429688, 1743.602783203125, 'f & lp i \nËlllfSÉ \n', 37, 0), (743.726806640625, 1745.749755859375, 747.3477783203125, 1754.249755859375, '»\n', 38, 0), (811.8768310546875, 1658.46630859375, 825.1648559570312, 1680.46630859375, '■\n', 39, 0), (715.4268188476562, 1746.58642578125, 739.954833984375, 1763.319580078125, 'm i\n', 40, 0), (698.1278076171875, 1804.0498046875, 708.0473022460938, 1812.5498046875, '3 »\n', 41, 0), (730.2767944335938, 1755.261962890625, 775.0108642578125, 1799.85888671875, 'ü ¡\n■ \n-,\nmm\n', 42, 0), (985.8677368164062, 152.14967346191406, 1024.4658203125, 198.3026885986328, "'SB\nf|B|\nSISÉ\n", 43, 0), (1095.5577392578125, 211.56214904785156, 1107.9376220703125, 231.56214904785156, '■j\n', 44, 0), (1610.607666015625, 62.536109924316406, 1633.463623046875, 78.5361099243164, 'mss\n', 45, 0), (1590.2076416015625, 117.8088607788086, 1610.0296630859375, 126.3088607788086, 'KM«\n', 46, 0), (1450.517578125, 166.9693603515625, 1452.93359375, 170.9693603515625, '■\n', 47, 0), (1477.8665771484375, 183.35682678222656, 1501.89599609375, 191.85682678222656, 'H H H\n', 48, 0), (1538.3665771484375, 209.75685119628906, 1564.9459228515625, 218.25685119628906, 'H H H\n', 49, 0), (1559.715576171875, 258.4568176269531, 1705.7645263671875, 279.30908203125, 'BH\nBU\n', 50, 0), (1150.265625, 296.5179138183594, 1165.1097412109375, 318.45281982421875, 'U\n', 51, 0), (957.8156127929688, 367.4029235839844, 1698.731689453125, 376.8547668457031, 'FRIDAY, MAY 19, 1961.\nTHE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.\nPAGE THREE\n', 52, 0), (957.315673828125, 398.5169372558594, 1237.8096923828125, 451.45184326171875, 'Debate Society Elects Werner \nTo Post of 1961-62 President\n', 53, 0), (954.6656494140625, 459.3537902832031, 1105.8594970703125, 703.0513916015625, 'At the last meeting for the \n1960-61 season the Debate Society \nset up its slate of offices for the \ncoming year. \nPresident elect is \nJohn Werner, a junior; vice presi- \n- dent for the coming season will \nbe A1 DePrince, a sophomore; the \noffice of treasurer and secretary \nwill be held by Chuck MacDonald \nand Karen Heske respectively; \nboth of these officers are present\xad\nly freshmen.\nThe outgoing officers of the so\xad\nciety \nare: \nMaurice \nNermberg, \npresident; Bill HodgkinSon, vice \npresident; John Werner, treasurer \nand A1 DePrince, secretary.

He \nnever gave his own squad’s score because there.never was any. \nHisi \nteam rarely penetrated the ten yard line—their own ten yard line. \nFinally, because his team traveled so much and was on the road so \noften, a bus was bought, all the students loaded aboard, and the \nschool was closed. \nIt’s now known as the Blue Ridge Bus Line.\nThe Why of Football\nSince those mythical days, Rip Engle has come a' long way in \nfootball, but admitted that until the last two years no one. had asked \nhim exactly WHY anyone should play football or participate in ath\xad\nletics. \nThe question was first asked him by the sponsors of a Euro\xad\npean clinic on the sport of football, as Engle and two other U. S. \ncoaches prepared to teach the fundamentals of the game. \nThe fact \nthat Rip Engle was nationally known, had coached winning teams, \nor had been President of the American Football Coaches Association, \nor all his other credentials were nearly as important as his message \nTuesday evening.\nEngle justified football and sports in general to his inquisitors \nby answering that the material rewards of athletics were insigifificant \ncompared to “feeling” that one receives from sports alone. The feel\xad\ning of exhiliration in a hard fought win. The feeling of running a \ngauntlet of emotion, ranging from despair, frustration, and exhaust\xad\nion to pride, joy, and the indescribable inward satisfaction of triumph. \nThe all important sense of accomplishment. Only sports provide a \ndynamic medium for this “feeling”.\nBoys giving of themselves under strain and pressure, displaying \ncourage, which Winston Churchill described as the “One quality that \nallows all others,” determination to win, and consequently knowing \nthe intense gratification of successfully fighting for some goal, were \nthe points of Engle’s thesis on sports. The “Giving” of oneself, the \nsacrifices, the lessons learned, the friendships made, are all a part of \nthe real rewards in sports.\nThese few paragraphs give only a brief picture of Rip’s philoso\xad\nphy on athletics, but for those who attended, it was refreshing to \nhear not a speech blasting the “Play for Pay” athletic image in \nAmerica today, but rather a tribute to those boys who seek and know \nthe real reward of sports.
