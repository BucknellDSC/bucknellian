Booters Start Practice
Today, Joe Diblin To
Assist Edwards

By John Bush

What dust the Bucknell grid war-
iors fail to kick up in the broad
Buffalo Valley this fall will be stirred
by the Bison Booters (soccer men)
who are expected to give the univer-
sity one of the most formidable
squads to represent the institution in
Many years.

Chief factor in the strength of this
Season's soccer squad is the number
of veterans and reserves from last
gears team who will return when
practice sessions begin today under
Coach Merle Edwards.

The varsity soccer men face a num-
ber of stiff opponents this season in
one of the toughest programs in the
aquad’s history.

An eight-week schedule, marked by
the initial contest with Gettysburg,
gway, on October 4, the day before
the opening football tilt with Penn
@tate, is concluded with the Western
Maryland match here on November
19th.

In the interin
facing a number college team
from all sections of the east includ-
ing Elizabethtown on October 12;

With conscription pigeon-holed for college men until the end of
the present academic year, most of the masculine population, ap well as

the feminine inhabitants, are looking forward to a

@ yeal social season on the Bucknell campus. Buck-
nell's social season is highlighted by three class
dances, featuring so-called “name” bands, which
are selected by their popularity and the size of the
class treasury.

Last year the three big dances were un-
doubtedly the best that Buckygellian have had the
pleasure to swing and sway at in many a year.
Les Brown, Will Osborn, and Glen Miller presented
amooth and subtle rythma plus concentrated jive

e that pleased Bucknellians no end. But just like a
football team that has had a successful season, this year’s class commit-
tees have a record to uphold, and that is going to be a difficult propo
aition iam .

Professor Stillman, who is the faculty adviser for the class
dances, deserves an unlimited amount of credit for his efforts in bring-
ing Glen Miller and his band to the campus last year. This year with Bucknell:
the cooperation of the entire student body and the class committees, he Jones, Glendon, ‘42; Nicolait, Eu

“The Bucknellian” has lost most of its faith in the collective
reasoning power of Bucknellians. We hesitate to conduct a
_presidential straw poll on campus because we do not wish to
prostitute the national crisis of 1940 on our pages, by subjecting
it to the indifference and shoulder-shrugging of a student body
which is too lazy to think.

We of the editorial staff are interested in (analysis), not
(partisanship). We carry no political banners, harangue for no
particular candidate. We think that an honest opinion of a ma-

great news value. But we can only get such an opinion from a

of his 150 pounds into every play.
And the other captain will be Center
Morrie Bessel, who’s so quiet that his
teammates have dubbed him ‘Mouse’.
Playing side by side on the line, they
are being counted upon to develop a
team morale which may compensate |
for part of the Herd’s weakness in
manpower.

Of the two, Plewak, a North Tona-
wanda, N. Y., boy, has had more first
atring experience. At the outset of
his sophomore season, his speed and

inches in height. Last year serious
injury kept him on the sidelines most
of the season. He’s one of the more
versatile Bison athletes, playing cen-
ter in basketball and high-jumping in
track.

George Boner looms ae the Number
One eligible for the fullback job va-
cated by George Kiick. A dynamic
Hine-bucker, he maintains his fighting
spirit during the winter season by
serving as heavyweight on Coach Joe
Reno's boxing team.

Walter Wenrick won o starting as-
signment at the beginning of his
sophomore season and will be hard
to dislodge now. The kind of player
who seldom makes headlines, Wen-
rick is rated as the finest defensive
back on the squad. He tackles hard
and defends his territory astutely
against aerial] raids.

ADVICE TO THE LOVELORN
Dear “Heartbalm” Golden:

My boy friend won't take me to the
big State game this Saturday. He
@ays we hoven’t got a chance of win
ning against those big, bad Lions.
And anyway, he says, they are going
to pull a lot of naked reverse: and |
that would only embarass me

But you see, I'm a good cheerlead-
er and Dwight Milleman said the |
cheerleaders were going to win all |
the games for ua this year.

I just hafta go. What shall I do? }

Alma Mater.
Dear Alma Mater:

It ie obvious that your boyfriend |
dvesn't love you anymore. So ditch |
him and let ‘im get mouse-trapped in
Lewisburg The Lion hasn't licked |
us yet, so go out to route 45 and put
your thumb to work. In case you get
stuck, vour reporter will be out on his
bicycle to pick you up.

Fair damsels who “drag” cadets or

pidshipmen look forward all year to
the Army-Navy game, and so the fai
c»-eda of Bucknell and State look
forward to the Penn State-Bucknell
game. New York, Paris, and Holly
wood stvle setters received stiff com-
petition from the female element at
Beaver Field last Saturday.

Topping off the female costumes
were the huge yellow chrysanthe-
nums, symbolic of fall and football,
and the bright orange and blue feath-
jers of Bucknell, and the purple and

ite of Pen State. Scattered
among the chic tailored clothes of
red, black, and purple were various

ored plaids
very scarce while cordur

YOU SEE THESE TWO WORDS IN
“THIS ARTICLE

HOW OFTEN
THE COURSE OF A DAYS SHOPPING
FOR SALE—AS ADVERTISED.’

A

SHEE

AND THOSE TWO WORDS ARE AS WELCOME AS
THEY ARE FAMILIAR. FOR THEY FORM A BOND OF
CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THE MERCHANT AND YOUR-
SELF. THEY ARE HIS GUARANTEE TO YOU OF WORTH
AND VALUE.

HERE IS AN ARTICLE THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER. ITS MERITS HAVE BEEN TOLD.
YOU KNOW ITS QUALITY, ITS UTILITY; YOU KNOW
HOW IT FITS YOUR NEEDS, AND WHEN YOU BUY IT,
YOU KNOW YOU ARE GETTING NOT SOME UNAPPROV
ED SUBSTITUTE BUT THE SPECIFIED ARTICLE AS
REPRESENTED.

IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY FHAT PHRASE
“AS ADVERTISED” CREATES A FEELING OF CONFI-
DENCE. YOU HAVE LEARNED TO DEPEND UPON CON-
SISTENTLY ADVERTISED PRODUCTS. YOU KNOW
THAT THE MAKER HAS CONFIDENCE IN THEM, ELSE
HE WOULD NOT SPEND MONEY CALLING THESE AR-
TICLES TO YOUR ATTENTION WEEK AFTER WEEK,
AND MONTH AFTER MONTH. YOU KNOW THAT THEY
HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE MOST CRITICAL OF
INVESTIGATORS — THE BUYING PUBLIC. AND ABOVE
ALL YOU KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT BUYING
GOODS “AS ADVERTISED” IS THE BEST INVESTMENT
FOU CAN MAKE.

SCOOPED AND SURPRISED.

After seeing the Bucknell Bisons slow down ao high geared State
team last Saturday, we were in a happy frame of mind, even though a
so-called scoop turned out to be a dud. All of which just goes to show
you that {f you know anything three weeks before anybody else, it just
doesn't pay to keep it under your hat Especially in the newspaper
business, But all that is just so much water under the bridge at present

We did get a surprise out of the band that we didn’t expect, and
that was the three distinctly different uniforms on the Bucknell Drum
Majors. The two white uniforms would pass any critical eye, but not

Our Daddy surely cannot believe that he has a monopoly on EER AO 7 F
his particular brand of campus student appeal. At least three
other establishments render services parallel to his. In addi-
tion to this, these establishments not only endeavor to employ .
student help whenever possible, but can find an extra dollar or
two now and then to increase their business by advertising in
the campus weekly. These establishments know that the good
will and support of the Bucinell news organ can make them;
and that lack of this good-will and support can break them (be-
cause their business ventures are of the kind that must have
complete social approval from the students, and “The Bucknell-
ian” can build thie).
Must Daddy learn from bitter experience that Bucknellians
do not enjoy. being made suckers?

The big thrill of the day occurred

Alas, it was ruied in the negative

again the Bisons held and Knupp!

Dr. Lewis Theiss
Speaks At Sigma
Tau Delta Meeting

A talk by Dr. Lewis E. Theiss,
Bucknell's suthor-profeasor and head
of the Journalism Department, waa
the featured event of the last Sigma
Tau Delta meeting, held Wednesday,
October 9, in the Vaughn Literature
Lounge. eT in i

Dr. Theiss has written over thirty
books including the well known
“Wings Over the Pacific’, and “The
U. S&. Mail”. With the exception of
hie Jatest book which is a tale o sub-
marines, all of his books have had
aviation for their main theme, and
have usually dealt with the Pan-
American Airlines. “

In contrast to many modern novels,
Dr. Theiss explained that his books
have been written with a definite edu-
cational purpose in mind. Fictional,
with realistic detail, they follow the
news and deal with up to date events
in World History

To bring the writing itself closer
to the students, Dr. Theiss displayed
some of his original notes, and ex-
plained the use of other reference
materig In order to further the
effect of reality in his books, he uses
various airplane and
submarine murat charting their

COLLEGE INN ADVERTISING

The COLLEGE INN is an enthusiastic patron of the advertis-

ing facilities of Bucknell’s various publications.

Our average budget

for such purposes is five dollars a week, which, relatively speaking,

is not small change.

We are thoroughly sold on advertising, and get

more than our money’s worth in direct returns from such investmenta.
Week after week and year after year, we attempt to give you fresh
and interesting copy—and, believe it or not, we write our own ma-

terial,

We know that it is not always adequate, but we prefer our

own ideas in our own language; and Mr. Britton, at the Print Shop,

rectifies most of our mistakes.

The editors and managers of the BUCKNELLIAN are our per-
sonal friends and our greatest assets in maintaining a healthful busi-

neas at the COLLEGE INN.

We greet you and salute you, Editor

Crum et cetera, and acknowledge that we owe you a debt of gratitude.
The COLLEGE INN, in her jong history, has never done a better
business, and we place a wreath of thanks on the altar of cumulative

advertising dividends.

Scanning the BUCKNELLIAN will readily

reven! many others who gratefully support Bucknell’s publications.
But we have never had so much business that we would commit eco-

nomic suicide by seorning our advertising friends,

We are not un-

mindful of the Administration that has made Bucknell to grow in
grace and stature and in favor of Phi Beta Kappa and oven its high
priest. We thank you both, and promise to show our continued grati-
tude by becoming servants of al! Bucknellians.

How To Walk The Four Mile:

Advice to the love-worn, gathered
from purely impersonal, unbiased, ob-
jective sources, and approved by Ima
Lovanfuhl, President of the Women's
Congress, and “Skip” Daits, Presi-
dent of the Student-Faculty Govern-
ment Association:

Walk the entire course of the four-
mile well before impending date, so
that you'll be prepared to answer
date's questions such as, “What's an |
armory 2", “What's your fraternity
pin like?', and to describe scenery
a'ong road. j

Don’t cut campus, and don't be
particular who belongs to what park- |
ed car; this rule is restricted to the
Freshmen.

Avoid cross-country men, who are
hitting the road these Fall after-
noons. They're getting in condition: |
don’t demoralize them.

Don’t talk so much; let the Autumn
foliage monopolize the conversation. |
You'll] make 100 percent more head- |
way.

Carry a walking stick It gives:
you the appearance of being virile
and masculine, and dates are allergic |
to dogs. !

Walk facing traffic, on the outside |
(this clause inserted at the sugges- |
tion of Superlative Life Insurances
Company), unless it’s a blind date
and you want to be alone.

(These rules passed on and adopt
ed in the basement of Horticulture
Halli last night).

Tverybody's Doin’ It:

Back in 1846 when a few closely
united trustees were thinking about
founding a college in Lewisburg.
someone said something about school-
epirit Without casting any reflec
tion on the previous ninety-three stu-
dent bodies at Bucknell, we might say
that 1846 was about the furthest this
idea ever got.

The Freshman cheering section
a good idea; the Booster Club has
accomplished its purpose as far as it |
has gone; Bucknell banners are au |
selling down-town, and still a lot of
us don’t realize what school spirit is. |
In some cases school spirit calls for |
singing the Alma Mater and weeping
a few minutes in’ memory of old,
Bucknell; in other instances it re-
quires stepping outside of our own
300 acres for a minute and reeogniz- |
ing the existence of other colleges in
the United States. I refer to an in- |
stance which occurred last Saturday
at the Bucknell-Ursinus Dad’s Day.
game. In the first place, the touch-
down Ursinus scored was made in all |
faith to their Alma Mater: we should |
not have begrudged them the sevei |

would have been the appropriate song. |

editorial arraignment for thi
tion by
whole

It had previously been the belief of this editorialist that the
protection of the interests of minorities is one of the most in-
tegral and primary functions of a democracy, and that suppres-
sion of minorities is usually the keynote for the advent of totali-
tarianism. Yet he finds that this conviction has been a wrong
one, according to this week’s letter to the editor

For one whole week—seven long days—the writer of last
week's editorial watched a scab heal over the sore that had been
opened when Cap and Dagger voted on scrapping ‘““Three Men
on a Horse’ Expectantly he waited for the minority in that
organization who are “activated by a desire for the intellectual
advancement and diversion of the general public to defend their
cause. He listened to disgruntled carping and caviling by a
few dissenters who muttered vague ‘imprecations’ against indi-
‘viduals, and failed to advance one sensible argument in favor of
their convictions. The sore seemed to be healing nicely, from
all outside appearances, but Cap and Dagger’s obvious desire to
“forget and forgive’ seemed to indicate pretty conclusively that
all was not sugar and cream among the dissenters, and that a
scab was forming over proud flesh. So, failing at other forms
of finding out the truth, “The Bucknellian” arraigned the dis-
senters, boldly and baldly.

“What's the matter with the die-hards who formed the min-
ority? Was their vote motivated by mere “‘cussedness” or do
they object to the present functioning of Bucknell student gov-
ment?” This was “The Bucknellian’s” arraignment. It
brought absolutely no reply from the lethargic thespians. It
took a conscientious alumnus, two hundred miles away, to de-
fend his former colleague’s dissension, which he did in a letter

organ, through an
minority, to justify its posi-
xplaining its convictions to the student body as &

INTERFRATERNITY BALL.

During the past week there ambled out of the limbo of things past,
a vaguely familiar idea that has been pushed to great heights in the
short space of one week. Interfraternity Ball. Yes, Bucknell is back
on the old subject. Shall we have an Interfraternity Ball or would it be
best to forget the matter entirely. That is the stage the idea has reach-
ed for several years, but action was never taken to carry it any further.

Not so this year! Fraternity men have come to the realization that
college life just isn’t college life without an Interfraternity Ball. A
committee under the direction of faculty adviser on college social affairs,
Donald Sti}Iman, has placed the idea on a sound basis for the firat time,
with the full support of the fraternities, and plans for the realization of
a dream are now in progress.

Of course there is the little matter of money that always rears its
ugly head over such a proposition. The eleven social fraternities on the
Bucknell campus will have to bear the brunt of the financial burden,
which will really be a burden for some houses to carry.

The plan as it stands at present calls for a big name band to supply
the music, which will be all very good if the fraternities can supply the
major amount of the financial assistance needed. The way conditions
stand at present the very least the fraternal organizations would have
to contribute would be $50.00. The balance of the money for the orches-
tra would have to be made up in the sale of tickets to non-fraternity
members, as all fraternity men would be admitted free.

A date for the dance is also a factor that proved to be a headache
in the past. The college social calendar is generally so full, that another
social event just can’t be crowded in at a suitable time. Last year it
was suggested that the campus Greeks give up one night of their annual
spring houseparty for the purpose of sponsoring an Interfraternity Ball.
This plan met with such denounciation that it was dropped, and after
such a display of disapproval it is unlikely the same suggestion will be

ie again this year

A date that really seems to offer the best possibilities for the affa

e Friday Homecoming Weekend. Not only would it be acceptable

e fraternities, but it would offer an added attraction to alumni and

dded entertainment for the weekénd.

to the editor. That he also censured the campus news organ for
arraigning the dramatists is thoroughly understandable, in view
of the fact that he undoubtedly took it for granted for their con-
victions, even after being defeated by a majority of “two sturdy
votes”. .

“The Bucknellian” maintained that “it would have been a
case of pure suicide on campus, for the dramatic organization,
had it voted to retain “Three Men on a Horse”. This is true,
if Bucknellians at present are victims of intellectual inertia, and
quail at stark realism, as our letter-writer implies. But how
can thig intellectual inerita be evercome, if “the most vigorous
and self-assertive of the campus arts” completely refuses to de-
fend and champion its own philosophy of arts before the student
body?

Studies Union Plan

Will Not Accept Streight’s
‘Union Now’ Immediately,
But Will Consider

The Advisory Council of the Chriat-
fan Association meeting Monday eve-
ning at the Recreation Center voted
to replace the former Peace Action
Group with an active chapter of Fed-
eral Union.

This action was taken because of
the conviction that this plan repre-
sents constructive thinking toward a
new world orderr, and that this plan
represents constructive thinking to-
ward a new world order, and that the
times are urgent for clearer insight
{nto our national direction. 7

Miss Melrose, the chairman of the
Advisory Council made up of 26 stu-
dents, faculty, and townspeople, ap-
pointed the following committee to
initiate the idea: FE. L. Junkin, chair-
man, Allen Halline, Bruce J. Miller,
James Gathings, John Zeller and
Marian Weinberger. A meeting of
interested individuals from the cam-
pus and community will be held this |
coming Monday evening at 7:30 in|}
the President's Home. The American!
Legion members similarly interested
fn this proposal will be present

Recent impetus to this interest ir

Take a tip from the All-Star game.
Tusa Mclaughry proved you don’t
have to have big-names to win ball

games Bucknell doesn’t have a
couple of heralded men like Kiick
and Funair this year, but we think
the '40 edition is a better club. Much
better spirit, more teamwork, better
passers, much better pass receivers,
and more reserve line strength...
When the heck are the morgue-bugs
coming around to make that bet we
offered them three weeks ago—-—~
that the Herd would better the 1939
record ?..........Handicapping the Bisons

acceptable to the Bucknell Social
Committee before any definite ar-
rangements can be made.

Bob Morrison is the chairman of
the Interfraternity Ball committee.
This committee is not under the di-
rection of Mr. Donald Stillman, fac-
ulty adviser on college social affairs,
as was stated in last week’s Bucknell-
ian, but Mr. Stillman said that he
was willing to cooperate fully with
the committee.

A date for the dance is still unse-
lected. The Friday before Homecom-
ing weekend, which had been consid-
ered the most satisfactory, has met
with several objections. Two other
}dates are being considered, however.
One is during the weekend after the
Christmas vacation, and the other is
‘during the weekend after final exams.

Over Station WKOK

Bucknell’s Radio Workshop has on-
tered intoits serond year of radio pre-

| sentations for the man-about-the-

campus and the comely co-ed. Pre-

Co-operative Book Store, under the
‘direction of Bob Fredrickson, ‘41, i
'now operating on a full-time basis.
The “store on the hill”, which start-
ed in the fall of 1938 with the sale
f one philosophy book to a student
in East College, has developed into a
miniature department store handling

to a more normal state, to analyze |
the swing {in collegiate opinion dur- |
ing the months when congress was
debating and passing the conscription
bill.

Comment of the Daily Athenaeum
at West Virginia university is typi-
eal: “Strangely enough, the consen-!|
sus on the campus has changed con-
siderably since last spring. Many
who were then opposed to conscrip-
tion are now in favor of the draft”.
The Athenaeum also observes that
American youth has no argument!
with peoples of any land and would |
rather apend ita energy in friendly
rivalry of sporte—“BUT YOUTH IS
READY”.

At Louisiana State University, the
Daily Reveille urges “a vote of confi- |
dence to our congressional leaders ,
who finally secured passage of the_
conscription bill Why should we
not have selective service when the
imminent black clouds of war are
shadowing every phase of liberty de-
signed by peace-loving peoples?”

At East Texas State Teachers col-

lege, the East Texan believes that the

munitions makers are now satisfied, ;
and that “they smile as they run their
hand in their pocket to feel the place

that will hold those fat, juicy profits”.

But the Texan adds that “from past
demonstrations of patriotism on the
campus, it is evident that all stu

dents will answer the call and that
they will be glad to defend their
country”

While admitting it atural
enough” that some college men should
not favor the draft law, the College
Exponent at Maysville (N. D.) State
Teachers college warns the public
not to “get the wrong opinion of this
college youth. The majority believe
in military training for the defense
of our country. No class of youth is
more patriotic or loyal to these
United States”.

“Conseription should be hated”, de-
clared the Brown University Daily
Herald, “but it should not be shun-'
ned. We should use it in the same
way we use a dangerous and distaste-
fu) medicine when the body must be
protected from the onslaught of a
deadly disease”

Analysis of nationwide collegiate
opinion reveals considerable support
for the view expressed by the Alliga-
tor at the Univ. of Florida: “Con-
scription n sncrifice worth making
so long as the conscripted defend
not offend, invade or seek t m
quer”. Echoing this warning is the
Dartmouth, which fears “there may
be a danger in the spirit that runs
through it all. If we do not intend
to find our own war, we had_ best
keep the fact in mind. If our talk
of war against the principles of fas-
ciam ia sincere, it would do n
to fight it at home with action and
words. A beaten-up Jehovah’s Wit-
ness makes unconvincing copy for an
anti-facism crusade.”

Thus the nation’s student
cepts the principle of conscription,
villing to sacrifice when necessary
but on the alert to safeguard historic
libertier,

D. Garman, who is in charge of the
ground course. Ten students from
the junior and senior classes comprise
the group, which includes one gir!
member, Jean Rockwell.

Flying instruction is given under:

the direction of the manager of the
Danville airport, Eugene Cole. With-
in a short time, the students will be

man's ground course
meets each Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday evening from 7:00 to 9:00.

At present, studies have been tem-
porarily suspended because of a de-
ly in the release of government text-

devoted to a study of civil aeronau-
tics regulations and to the theory of

100,000 “FINS” SHOT:

This is the first in a series of ar-
ticles by the “Inquiring Reporter”
All statements are based on actual
answera, however inaccurate they
may appear They are colored and

reporter for greater effect. No names
or personalities are mentioned in con-

The question proposed to the stu-
dent body this week is, “If you were
te give $500,000 of a hard-earned for-
‘tune to Bucknell, with what restric-
tion would you endow this sum?’

The first reply comes from Ura
Gune, who is quite influential in cam-

'Vd give my money to the construc-
ition of a new Biology Building. My

easual, has this to say: “If TI had

courses last semester, and my pro-
(fessors are awful dumb.”

| Our shifty back, “Speed” Deeman,
offers the following: “I’d build a new
‘at’letic arena, inside, next to da gym.

Iphigenia Farthingale, who entered
jeollege rather late, but who is presi-
‘dent of Beta Tones, music sorority,
hits all the high notes in: “I'd build
a new music school for Bheknell; the
one we have now is constructed so
that whenever [ practice, people
across the street complain. Good

‘lations in my proposed new building,

BUILDER OF FUTURES

This is one of tl
tudents during the

Four years of college, and then what:
foremost questions in the minds of most
days of their matriculation at Bucknell But during the past
four ars an Organization on campus ha tantly been grow
ing in the power to answer that question, positively and sati
factorily. This organization is the Bucknell Placement Burea

Established in the years when a colle ge student hopes of
getting a substantial position upon graduation were as slim a:
are those of Roosevelt for balancing the national budget, the
Bureau proved itself a flourishing, though perhaps undernour
ished infant, and has grown in power and scope in spite of the
economic adversity prevailing in the country at large, until this
year the organization, with a well designed job-securing pro-
gram, has laid plans for the most intensive and effective activity
in its history.

Recently President Marts met with Dr.’s Matz and Peter-
son, of the Bucknell Commerce and Finance Department, and
James Tyson, prominent insurance manager of Philadelphia, to
make plans for Bucknel! alumni to visit Commerce and Finance
classes at Bucknell during the second semester. These alumni,
chosen because of their success in the business field, will speak
to students on advertising, sales merchandizing, accounting,
Statistics, life insurance, transportation, and all other subjects
related to employment activity in the business world.

This meeting between alumni who know the requirements
necessary to satisfy employers, and professors, who are the “em-
ployee builders”, to discuss the practical aspects of putting em-
ployable “raw material” to work, is a healthy sign. It is an
indication that the B. U. Placement Bureau has reached a virile
maturity, when alumnus joins forces with professor and student
in a concentrated effort to make Bucknell not only “A Way of
Life" but also “A Way for Finding a Living

Bucknell’s chapel program on November 21 will be in
charge of the Placement Bureau. At that time, Cameron Beck
one of the greatest vocational and industrial consultants in the
United States will deliver an address. Mr. Beck, formerly the
Personnel Director of the New York Stock Exchange, decided
approximately two years ago to devote his entire time to the
lecture field, and is now doing so. He maintains his headquar-
ters at the School of Business Practice and Speech in Rockefel-
ler Center The “Bridgeport Life”, recently said of him, “A
thousand Mr. Becks going around the country talking to our
boys and girls will do much to untangle our present entangle
ment

Walter Leland, Bucknell University’s Employment Man-
ager in New York City, will be on campus at various time
throughout the year, to counsel students and aid them in shap
ing plans for securing work after graduation

CAMPUS

POLITICAL BATTLEFRONT

With national election day less than two weeks away, there are
thousands of college students, who for the first time in their life can
take advantage of their 21 years, and cast their vote in a presidential
election. But how will they cast it? Do they know who they want to
vote for Does it make any difference to them who wins the coming
election? Are they influenced by their parents as to which party will
receive their support? These are all important questions, and the ma-
jority of college students pass over them lightly, with little thought of
what changes a presidential election may bring about.

But is it entirely the students fault if he is uninterested in the
political -affairs of the nation? It seems that instead of enlightment
for the American public all there is in evidence right now is befuddle-
ment. How aré you going to cast your ballot when you realize that it
is a fact, that both presidential candidates are actually Democrats, and
both vice presidential candidates are Republicans. How can an old line
Republican or an old line Democrat vote for a combination like that.
There is a great percentage of voters, who are old timers at this voting
proposition who can’t make up their minds. Of course you can say,
“Vote for the two best men”, but how many dyed in the wool Republi-
cans or Democrats will cast their ballot for the opposing party leader
because they think he is the better of the two'men. Very few! Even
if many of the old line voters thought their candidates were not as cap-
able as those of the opposition they would sti]! vote for the men nomir
ated on their party ticket.

Students are further confused by the fact that an analysis
party platforms reveals that they are practically the same
spect. In fact there is a professor on the Bucknell campus whc
any member of his class an A for a final grade, if that person
him three distinct differences in the platform of the two major
parties. What the student voter supposed to do in a case like this

Letters to the Editor

Bucknell’s First Citizen

Letter to Secretary of Student Fac-
ulty Congress,
Dear Miss Outman:

I have your note about boosting
attendance at “The Late Christopher
Bean”. I shall certainly attend if 1
am in town that evening.

I appreciate very much the action
which Cap and Dagger took in an en-
deavor to select a play which is in
keeping with Bucknell ideals and feel
more enthusiastic about ‘supporting
them than ever.

With best wishes for a successful
play.

Yours sincerely,
Arnaud C. Marts.

| S. F.C. Chief

Dear Sir:

Recent editorials and letters to the
editor have produced enough arraign-
ments to effectively cloud the issue
of the recommendation by the Student
{Faculty Congress to Cap and Dagger
concerning the play, “Three Men on
n Horse

For the sake of any persons who
may be interested and who are now
somewhat puzzled about the whole af-
fair, let us look at the issues involved.
It seems that S. F. ¢
cized on two counts

1 The Congress itself is to blame
\for the fact that the production muat
be discontinued now, when the dra
group has already spent tw
f work on it Three Men
selected for presen

last spring. Why didn
ate it then

gathered independently by C. & D.
and then to decide for itself the fate
ef “Three Men on a Horse”. The fact

happens when thirst meets

thirsty feeling leaves and a
refreshed feeling comes.
Pure, wholesome, deli-
cious,—ice-cold Coca-Cola
satisfies completely.

THE PAUSE T

Benled ender sutharity of

has been criti-

in the |

| that 23 persons in C, and D. were
hese to abandoning its production
}would show that the Congress’s ree-
ommendation was not considered tan-
tamount to a decree

| It might be interesting to note
‘what Professor Willard Smith wrote
in a recent letter to the executive
‘committee of Student Faculty Con-
gress. He wrote, “In spite of all the
jnovel reporting in the Bueknellian
and the magnificent arraignment, I
still think the 8. F. C. managed its
theatrical debut with dignity and
fairness. The new show is coming
along excellently.”

The tackling of controversial issues
by the student governing body is a
sign of healthy democratic procedure,
we believe But when considering
such issues, it will be necessary for
all of us to keep clear-eyed and clear
headed, retaining our long-range per-
spective

In the meantime, let us all support
with our attendance the splendid ef-
‘forts of the Cap and Daggerites to
produce under a terrific time handi-
cap the play, “The Late Christopher
Bean”

Be seeing you at
weekend.

He actually did it last

Why

“Because I wanted t ee what
jpeople lived like and see what the
country looked like”, said Warner

To give a detailed itinerary of the
trip would be boresome. But
| He was arreste d on a vagranc
charge once and kicked off trains in
railroad yards five or six times

He was badly scratched and torr
when ordered to “get the h of” of
i freight moving at 35 m. p. h

He slept—in school yards ov
and stationary freights, truck cab
hobo jungles, jail, railroad static
platforms, county fai grounds, a
mansion in Zaneaville, Ohio

He endured extreme heat
115 degrees in Barstow, California
and also great cold

college spirit is certain to echo and
re-echo within Memorial Stadium on
\Saturday as the Bison’s face one of
their heftiest weekend assignments

Heroes may be crowned, hopes may
be wrecked and others may flourish

Bill Ramage shot the pellet past
the Sammie goalie two minutes after

made by Warren Baker, Fiji goalie,
protected Phi Gam’s slim lead from

The first ‘o parade were the faculty.
The prize was won by Miss Reno
dressed as a Brazilian woman. Some
of the others included: Miss Derr and
Misa Geil as the last roses of summer,
and Miss Barnhart as a paper-hanget.

Next to be judged were the groups.
Of these the one judged best, was Mr.
and Mra. Alumnus with their children,
all potential Bucknell students, This
was represented by Honor House.
Other groups were the family from
“The Grapes of Wrath”, a blue blan-
ket dragon with it’s keeper, a col-
lection of (grain) bags wearing pos-
tere about the Temple game, and a
group of goose stepping soldiers with
awastikas.

After this, individuals representing
everything from ballet dancers to the
foreign situation paraded. Prizes
were awarded for the most original

towels, and wearing a sign “Even the

Freshmen Supper
Club Held Banquet
At Woodward Cave

The last of six meetings of the,
Freshman Supper Club was a ban-
quet held last night at Woodward's
Cave. The gathering was purely a|
social event, and there were no spe
cial speakers.

The purpose of the club was to’
bring 20 Frosh girls and 20 Frosh
boys together every Wednesday night
for six weeks for o dinner, during
which time speeches were made by
campus leaders and faculty members.

In former years the other Frosh
Supper Clubs got together once dur-
ing the winter to go to Eaglesmere
on a tobogganing party It is ex-
pected that this year’s club will do! pu
the same, although no definite plans
j have been made.

A. Robert Blattner, a future me-|
chanical engineer by vocation, a|
gentleman of the continental school |
by avocation, and a Bison frosh by
designation, is living on Bucknell Hill
this semester.

His room in East Wing is not what
you'd expect a dormitory room to re-
semble. You're at once struck by the
rimplicity of it Straight, plain
chairs, desk and bookcase arranged
efficiently. The bookcase filled with

f all things—books The Bible
biographies, books of the month, a
copy of the Oxford Book of Verse
and several volumes in French

The tousle haired and unassuming
inmate sits with crect posture, his
bearing vibrating an hospitable
charm. Looking up with a touch of
a warm smile and an_ attractively
modulated voice, he answers that most

The parentage of this world-tra\

he was brought into this world under
the Egyptia un four day; after

where he would stay overnight. Then,
with his parents, on to Venice ir their |
Lancia automobile. The three hou
drive is by autostrade, a super-high
way similar to the new Pennsylvania
Turnpike. At Venice, which famour
city is built on 117 islands, the car is
left in the garage—n huge building
which constitutes the city’s sole auto }
parking site

Venice’s “main street” is the Canal
Grande which is navigated by gon-
dolas. The influence of Mussoltni's
modernization has lent what mighr
be judged a more civilized touch to
the ‘aquatropolis’. One can now hail
a ‘taxi’, which is a high-speed motor-
boat, and be comorftably whizzed to
any desired destination. An hour in
a fast boat brings the party to the
world renowned Lido. At the main
lending of the island of Lido, which
might be compared to our Catalina, a
hotel car, completes the journey to
the hotel, the Albergo Excelsior.

Outdoor Cinema in Sunny Italy

Italia, too, has its screen shindigs.
Fach year there is an open-air show-
ing of the year’s best cinematic out-
put, both domestic and foreign which
our friend has attended often. The
Mussolini Cup ia awarded to the film
which is adjudged the best. The af-
fair is complete with interviews and
Vlieg lights as distinguished as any
of Hollywood's ballyhooed premieres.
Attending are many international
personalities, who stay also to bask
at the renowned Lido beach’s warm
water and soft sand.

Another vacation took Blattner to
fierlin, where he saw a demonstra-
tron, unimportant then, in 19382, but
which was impressed upon his mind.
There was 4 scuffle outride the Bris-
{ol Hotel between the police and some
men wearing brown shirts. They
shouted dire threats at the authori-
ties, which since then have come true.

To us the electoral college is an outmoded custom for a streamlined
government, in fact Senator Cabot Lodge has already made the first
move to amend the constitution and eliminate this body. Of course we
realize that the “indispensable man” would still have won the election on
his popular vote, but if his W. P. A. votes were taken away from him
would he still hold a commanding lead? Would he even lead? Without
them we don't believe he would.

Some 21,500 cars aud trucks are in regular day to
day service with the Bell System. The great majority
have bodies specially developed by telephone engi-
neers. Many are equipped with power winches, air
compressors and pole derricks. Each of the many
types is designed to handle particular functivas in the
constraction and maintenance of telephone plant.

Planning, purchasing and operating the world's
largest fleet of commercial motor vehicles is a big
job in itself. Yet it is but part of the far bigger job:
providing the finest, fastest, friendliest servive to
the millions who daily use the telephone.

to many living Bucknellians His
connection with Bucknell as student
and teacher covered such a long span
of years that I doubt if there is a
Bucknellian living that did not know
him. He was a living symbol of the
finest ideals for which Bucknell has
always stood and his passing will re-
move a precious element from our
leampus life which no one else can
lever replace.

I am grateflu that his long and
noble life overlapped the five years in
which I have been connected with
'Bucknell, for he wae an active help
and inspiration to me. On more than
one oceasion T have sought his knowl-
edge and his opinion and have been
aided invariably by his unselfish love
for Bucknell.

CAMPUS

by Walton Cloke
COLLEGIATE MANNERS 7???

Bucknellians were treated to one of the finest Artist Course presen-
tationn ever held at Bucknell, when Mise Gladys Swarthout, America’s
first lady of song, presented her recital in the Davis Gymnasium, last
Monday evening.

Not being ay expert critic on music or musical presentations, your
writer is not in m position to comment on the more technical pointe of
the recital, but the comment from this column is that never have we
heard a more beautiful, sparkling, soprano voice than Misa Swarthout’
Her vibrant, personality, combined with her lovely voice, presented a new
high in Artist. Course.entertainment on the Bucknell campus.

For Miss Swarthout we can’t find enough orchids, but for those most
inconsiderate little boys in the gallery, who thought they were watching
a slug-feat during the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference Championship
bouts, and whistled like three trains passing Tuxedo Junction all at one
time, we have a crate of lemons

We also have an additional crate of citrous fruit for those thought
less, fun loving collegians who applauded when the Bucknell student
assisting the pianist walked out on the platform to arrange the piano.
Of all the childish, thoughtless, inconsiderate, down right disgusting,
things to do, these two take first prize

Taking into consideration the attitude of those students on Monday
night we can do nothing but assume that they would do the same thing
in the Metropolitan Opera House, and that their manners just aren't
what a college students should be. They can be compared to those men
(we are assuming that Bucknell coeds have better manners) who mak«
a woman stand in a trolley car, or sit in the presence of ladies with their
hats on.

But the men weren't the only ones in the wrong. The young ladie
who came to hear Miss Swarthout in saddle shoes and sweaters were
definitely abusing the privilege of attending a concert, presented b

| famous 9 star as Miss Swarthout, dressed informal The correct at
tire for Miss Swarthout's recital was strictly formal, but due to the cit
cumstances this was impossib However it did not

College Inn Corsages

In the long history of the COLLEGE INN, we have always been
favored with friendly business relations from the Women’s College.
We have coveted this business with pardonable pride, because the re-
fining influence of the women students make the best picture of the
Bucknell ‘Way of Life With the coeds in our midst the environ-
ment improves at once. No draperies or refinements can approach
the beauty and appeal of our charming college girl With the sen-
sible and attractive clothing of the modern young lady, the arts of
the hair-dresser and complexior. connoisseur at their present peak, it
naturally follows that Bucknell coeds were never more attractive or
more intelligent

We are grateful for the rare privilege that your patronage be-
stows upon us Now that classrooms in West College and the new
Engineering Building and the offices in Old Main are functioning
again, women students find themselves once more in close proximity
to the COLLEGE INN Those little intermissions between classes
can be profitably spent here, in a friendly little chat, in light refresh-
ment, or in a dance or two. Your next class will find you invigo
ated, and eager for further intellectual achievements

Letters |

November 21, 1940.
Mr. William Crum,
Editor, The Bucknellian,
Lewisburg, Pa.

Dear Mr. Crum:

T have just read the Bucknellian
jand hasten to send my congratula-
tions to you and your Staff for the
recent honor conferred upon you. It
reflects credit upon all of you and
Bucknell may well be proud of your
success. ‘

T am glad to see that you keep
your sense of humor functioning.
'This should help take the sting out
‘of complaints. Don't let it worry
you but remember that there are al-
|ways people whose halos either don’t
fit or are too tight.

Personally | would like to see the
College add three new departments:

A Chair of Humor.
A Chair of Leisure.
A Chair of Imagination

A Chair of Humor might prevent
one from taking oneself too seriously.

A Chair of Leisure might prevent
hardening of the arteries.

A Chair of Imagination could be
combined with Fine Arts and together
with daubing and scribbling one could

ceive a lighter touch—a more tol-
erant attitude toward everyone and
erything So often people are

wbbed when they are alive amt

loudly praised after they are dead,
This is too bad, isn't it? But what
e expect when often the med-
h » people ex aoe
eather
my ngratulations and
e good work

Willard Gore lowt two a teeth
in the game with the Mules. He
went out to look for them Sunday, but
couldn't find them. When asked about

ithe reason, Will says, “T think we had

a fairly thuecethful theathon, I with
we could play Wethtern Maryland
again. I! think we'd theore enough
thith time to beat them eathy”.

To show you how Id it was at
Reading on Thanksgiving, they put
eoal-dust on the yard lines so they
could be seer have used
something else had they known that
George Boner scored the only touch-
down becuse he j wouldn’t stop
when he saw ml in front of him
Fred Kern played with gloves on, and
Nick Priore id that it took him till
Sunday defrosted

Personally, I don't think there is
any truth in ii, but when Johnny
Plewak didn’t come back on the bus,
someone said that he fell in a cleat
hole and that we'd have to wait till
the thaw to see Johnny again. It's a
good thing it was the last game

According our grea itistician
George Boner, the ictor yver Al

each tired quickly, but the surprise

ending resulted in 4 victory for the
Fiji.

165-Ib. Clase

Gus Cadwaller, PKP, punched and
clubbed his way to a three round de-
eision over Randy Campbell, PGD,
For thrills and action this fight
equalled any from either night. Des-
Pite Campbell's hard jabs, Cadwallad-
er’s bull-like rushes won a clean eat
decision for him.

In his precision-like manner Emil
Kordish, pride of LCA, decisioned
“Seotty” Whyte, SX, by a wide mar-
gin. No one doubted the outcome a
bit, but to 2 man the stands gave
Whyte @ great hand for his display
of “guts”, for in entering himself in
thie division Whyte weighed in at
146 Ibe. Kordish’s exhibition in this
fight was by far the best show of
boxing yet seen

175-tb. Class
Marv Gerla, SAM, and Bill Ander- |

son, SX, staged a reni battle royal |
for ‘the fans with Gerla emerging the |
winner on & decision. Each hit one |
another with everything except the}

ringpost, but Gerla’s former experi-
ence proved to be the winning factor.

Earl Thomas, KS, won by a decis- |

ion from Marty Neff, SAE Coming
right on the heels of the Gerla-An-
derson battle, this bout could have
been termed its sequel Not once
was there a dull moment as both men
fought their hearts out in one of the
evening sest fight
Heavyweight
Nagel, KS, won by a K. O
Frank DeAngelis in the
seer 1. Up to the time of the
Knockout Nagel had been getting
much the worst of the fight. DeAn
gelis in losing looked to be one of the
fastest and cleverest fighter seen
this year,

Jim Reichert, SX, made sh work
of Butch Miller, SAM, as the fight
was stopped in the first round. Reich
est had a size and weight advantage
over the game but out sed Miller

In a close fight, Jot Ba an
PKP, took the de n from Fran

Frank Strickland, KS, over Charlie

by Walton Cloke
TWO NIGHTS AT THE FIGHTS...

(—Any similarity. to persons living or dead is purely coincidental—)

Every year, in every way, they get better and better. J mean the
intramural boxing bouts. Not only do the fighters seem to improve, but
the audience itself offers a real show that is missed by some in their
overt zeal to see the fights. Besides watching the fights for the past
two nights and throwing a few rights and lefts from the press table, we
kept a watchful eye on the audience just to see how these fistic combate
emotionally arouse John J. Public. Well, we found out.

At 7:15 the fraternity men arrive to grab off the best seats in the
house, and have a little bull session over the fact that their man in the
135-lb. class should knock the tar out of the rival fraternity man. Be-
sides their man fought in several amateur bouts and won them all. No
need to let the opposition know that though, let’s tear him to ribbons
and throw him to the dogs.

Later the coeds charge through the doors and scramble for seats as
near to the scene of the murder as they can find. Because believe it o7
not they’re a blood thirsty lot. They like to see a bruising battle, and
some of them ,make no pretense at concealing their delight.

The referee and the judges finally come in and the crowd cheers its
head off for the first time, just to tune up their vocal chords. The judges
are introduced and one in. particular, he’s a handsome guy, gets more ap-
plause than the others. . He’s embarassed, and the crowd is happy be-
cause their influence has been felt.

Then up from the locker room smelling of every kind o liniment on
the market, and with too much vaseline smeared on their faces, come the
warriors of fisticuff. Big ones, little ones, tal! ones, short ones, fat ones
skinny ones, and some just fighters. Barnum would have been proud te
display the lot of them. They take their places trying to show a great
deal of complacency, and either falling over the water bucket or having
their gloves put on before they take their robes off, which mposaaible,

“WE PREFER THE BUCKNELLIAN”

LEWI
BUCK

FOR FORTY YEARS THE MERCHANTS OIF
BURG HAVE BEEN SAY!NG, “WE PREFER THE
NELLIAN’

THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS BY PLACING
MORE ADVERTISING IN THE BUCKNELLIAN THAN ANY
OTHER MEDIUM ON THE CAMPUS

THE REASON FOR THIS IS QUICKLY APPARENT

THE BUCKNELLIAN IS THE ONLY METHOD OF
COMPLETELY AND EFFICIENTLY COVERING THE EN
TIRE STUDENT BODY OF BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY

THESE STUDENTS FORM THE TOWN'S PRIMARY
MARKET FOR THE MERCHANTS ADVERTISING, A MAR-
KET THAT IS QUICKLY AND PROFITABLY RESPONSIVE
IT IS INEVITABLE, THEREFORE, THAT THE MER.
CHANTS OF LEWISBURG SHOULD MAKE THE “BUCK.
NELLIAN” THEIR FIRST CHOICE.

Duke is taking Brazil, Bolivia, Ecu-

Under the arrangement, libraries

COLLEGE SONGS BARRED BY RADIO..................

No longer will the radio audience of CBS, NBC, or MBC hear the
rousing fight songs of Americas greatest colleges and Universities, No
longer will the song of the United States Navai Academy, “Anchors
Aweigh”, or the song of the fighting men of Army, “On Brave Old Army
Team” be broadcast over the three leading networks in the United States

Why? Well it seems like a mystery to us to, but os far as we are
able to determine now it is true. The American Society of Composers,
Authors, and Publishers, the organization under which most of America’s
great college songs are published, and who lists under its membership
Thornton W. Allen, publisher of most of America’s outstanding college
songs, is being boycotted by this country’s three leading radio networks.
The reason for the boycott, according to a press release that reached
your writer’s desk this week, is to give a company called Broadcast Music
Inc., which is backed by the three large radio corporations complete con
trol of all music used on the air.

So it seems that the mogole of big broadcasting are letting them
selves open for the biggest lam-basting they have had in their collec
tively short span of oxistence. No longer will “On Wisconsin”, “The
Washington and Lee Swing”, “Fordham Ram”, “Maine Stein Song’,
“Fight On Pennsylvania”, “Hail To Pitt”, “Notre Dame Victory March”,
“Colgate Invictus”, and more than a 1000 other college songe be heard
uver the airwaves. ,

The BLACKOUT OF COLLEGE MUSIC is scheduled to start on
January 1 of 1941. Will the American colleges, if such a thing happens
and to all indications it will, stand by and see their victory songs, their
alma maters, songs that to them rank just below their national anthem,
swpet from the airlanes by big corporations seeking control in music
Or will they fight It is my opinion that they will fight, and if they do,
it will be a battle that I for one won't want to miss

Long before America listened to radios she listened to the alma
maters and victory songs of the colleges and universities that educated
her children, and without a doubt she will continue to demand to listen
to them If radio refuses to bring this music into the American home
the pressure is sure to be applied before long. Can American radio com
panies ignore college music? It ur guess that they can't, because
the people want it and it is the people who support radio

This ban on music that is published under the ASCP won't effect coi
lege music only, it will take from the airwaves such famou ngs as
Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America Perhaps Bucknell students, who
have a definite interest in “Bucknell’s Berlin” would have something to
say about this Others that will feet the axe are “Indian Love Call’
“Sylvia”, “Only For Ever”, “St. Louis Blues”, “Old Man River”, and that
favorite of all favorites “Sweet Adeline”, Alt of these are America
favorites, some of them older than radio itself

Will the dawn of the new year find them and America's college songs

n the shelf for good, or will college students and lovers of America’s
popular music stage a battle for their favorites and return them to their
deserved status on the radio?

to our

MERCHANTS

THE EDITORS OF THE “BUCKNELLIAN” BEING IN-

TERESTED IN ALL MATTERS THAT CONCERN NEWS.
PAPERS, NECESSARILY STUDY “ADVERTISING.” WE
NOTICE THAT THE “MERCHANTS” IN THE BIG CITIES,
WHO HAVE BUILT UP GREAT BUSINESSES THROUGH
| ADVERTISING, ARE ALWAYS HAVING “SALES.” THESE
: SALES SEEM TO COME AT REGULAR PERIODS. FOR IN-
| STANCE, THERE IS THE JANUARY “WHITE SALE", THAT
IS SO WELL ESTABLISHED THAT IT BECOME A TRADI-
TION IN DEPARTMENT STORE MERCHANDISING.

Customers know there will be such a sale, and they plan to

take advantage

of it. They make lists of their needs and stock up

for the year at these sales. The result is that they buy more goods
than they otherwise would, and the merchant sells more goods than

he could otherwise dispose of. Even though his profit is small, the
total turn-over is so large that he nets a worth while return. Both
merchant and customer are well satisfied,

We trust you will not misunderstand us when we suggest that

the time is ripe
dents will soon

in LEWISBURG for just such an effort. The stu-
leave. If you do not sell now, some of the goods

on your shelves, you will never be able to dispose of them. Why
not start the custom of a “CLEAN-UP SALE", when both you and

the students can benefit? Wouldn’t such a sale be of profit to you
if it, too, become a tradition.

WE believe it would.

THE “BUCKNELLIAN” WILL CARRY YOUR MESSAGE
TO EVERY ‘STUDENT’ IN COLLEGE. IN THAT RESPECT
YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER CITY MERCHANTS.
THERE IS NO PAPER THAT REACHES ALL THEIR CUS-
TOMERS. THE “BUCKNELLIAN” GOES TO ABSOLUTE-
LY EVERY ‘STUDENT’ IN THE ‘UNIVERSITY’.

Thy will be done on earth by men of good will; and may their tribe
increasc May good will toward all men bring peace on earth, and
withal, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

division.

The courses, dealing with engineer-
ing drawing, production engineering,
and materials inspection and testing,
started Monday and will continue for
twenty weeks, with the classes meet-
ing for three hours each Monday,
Werneasday, and Friday evenings.

From the total of 166 applications
received from persons desiring the
training, a maximum enrollment for
each course has been selected on the
basis of preparation and employment.
No more applications can be accept-
ed, Dr. Irland said. Enrollment in
the engineering drawing and produc-
tion engineering classes has been
limited to 30 each, while 16 students
will be trained in materials inspec-
tion and testing.

Seven central Pennsylvanian indus-
tries engaged in work helpful to na-
tional defense are represented among
the men accepted. They are: U. S.
Penitentiary at Lewisburg; Sprout,
Waldron and Company, of Muncy;
the Milton Manufacturing Company,
American Car and Foundry Company,

to the federal government for an in- '
| creased quota ef twenty enrollees in|
next semester's course, according to
information from his office this morn-
ing.

| During the past semester, nine
|Bucknell men, and one co-ed have
been taking both flight and ground
training, leading to private pilots’ |
licenses, and have now nearly com-
pleted both phases of their govern-
ment-sponsored course. Ground train-
ing classes have been under the su-
pervision of Dr. W. D. Garman of the |
Bueknel! Engineering department,
\who will give the final examination |
in his course on February 20.

Flight training has been under the
direction of Eugene A. Cole, manager
of the Danville airport Mr. Cole
has been responsible for the instruc-
tion of the ten Bucknellians in hand-
ling a plane in the air capably enough
so that they could solo with safety at |
the end of thirty-five hours of flight
instruction.

Celebrity

Harold Bauer, the internationally
famous pianist with the magic fing-
ers, who plays with a depth o mean
ing and structural symmetry that has
the glitter of spontaneous genius, |
will be the second world known musi-
cal figure to appear on the Bucknell
University Artist ‘Course program
thie year, when he plays a recital in|
the Lewisburg High Schoo! on Jan
vary 18 at 8:15 p. m.

To the general American public
Harold Bauer is an acknowledged
peer of master pianists, as evidenced
by the great crowds that hear him
annually at the New York Stadium,
the Philadelphia Dell, and the Holly-
wood Bowl.

Prior to becoming a concert pian-
iet, Mr. Bauer toured his native Eng-
land as a violin virtuoso He had
played both hinstruments, since child-
hood, but by some trick of chance
had chosen the violin Paderewski
heard him accompany a singer, and
was impressed by the singing quality
ef his tone. Upon his advice Bauer
turned to the piano, giving himself
three years in which to aecomplish
his purpose. 4 1

The result was that within the
stipulated three years, he appeared
with the Berlin Philharmonic Orches-

MUSIC FEUD.

A fellow member of the fourth estate, namely John Bush would like
me to put in a plug here for a new song that he has just written for MBI.
One that is sure to burn ASCAP up because they didn’t buy it when he
offered it to them for a cool ten thousand dollars last year, MBI says
that it will sell a million copies. Maybe we can get Benny Goodman to
play it at the Prom. It’s a smooth tune. Berlin will also have to look
to his laurels as will the guy that wrote “Practice Makes Perfect” who is
quitting the song writing racket because the royalties from the “Prac.
tice” song have netted him a cool million. Oh! The name of composer
Bush's song, why it’s “WHEN THE GOOSE COMES BACK TO MASSA
CHUSETTS”. Nice title Bush.

College Cheer Song
First Written For
Opposing School

Madison, Wis.—-(ACP)—The fam-
ous college song, “On Wisconsin” was
originally written for the University
of Minnesota.

Hard-pressed for money, William
T. Purdy composed the tune to com-
pete for a $1,000 prize offered by the
University of Minnesota for a new
football song. When Cari Beck of
New York, a friend of Purdy, heard
it, he wrote the words and persuaded
Purdy to give it to the University of
Wisconsin instead.

Played for the firat time on the eve
of the Wisconsin-Minnesota game in
1900, “On Wisconsin” was an immedi-
ate hit. Since then it has been adapt-
ed, with changes of words, by numer-
ous colleges through the U. 8.

When Purdy died in poverty in
1918, Wisconsin alumni and friends
gave $2,500 to his family. Later the
state provided scholarships at the
University for the composer's two
children.

The idea was eonceived last year,

campus was greater than ever be

point for the French club and all
French-speaking persons among the

THE EDITORS OF THE “BUCKNELLIAN” BEING IN-
TERESTED IN ALL MATTERS THAT CONCERN NEWS-
PAPERS, NECESSARILY STUDY “ADVERTISING.” WE
NOTICE THAT THE “MERCHANTS” IN THE BIG CITIES,
WHO HAVE BUILT UP GREAT BUSINESSES THROUGH
ADVERTISING, ARE ALWAYS HAVING “SALES.” THESE
SALES SEEM TO COME AT REGULAR PERIODS. FOR IN-
STANCE, THERE IS THE JANUARY “WHITE SALE”, THAT
IS SO WELL ESTABLISHED THAT IT BECOME A TRADI-
TION IN DEPARTMENT STORE MERCHANDISING.

Customers know there will be such a sale, and they plan to
take advantage of it. They make lists of their needs and stock up
for the year at these sales. The result is that they buy more goods
than they otherwise would, and the merchant sells more goods than
he could otherwise dispose of. Even though his profit is small, the
total turn-over is so large that he nets a worth while return. Both
merchant and customer are well satisfied.

We trust you will not misunderstand us when we suggest that
the time is ripe in LEWISBURG for just such an effort. The stu-
dents will soon leave. If you do not sell now, some of the goods
on your shelves, you will never be able to dispose of them. Why
not start the custom of a “CLEAN-UP SALE", when both you and
the students can benefit? Wouldn’t such a sale be of profit to you
if it, too, become a tradition. WE believe it would.

THE "“BUCKNELLIAN” WILL CARRY YOUR MESSAGE
TO EVERY ‘STUDENT’ IN COLLEGE. IN THAT RESPECT
YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER CITY MERCHANTS.
THERE IS NO PAPER THAT REACHES ALL THEIR CUS-
TOMERS. THE “BUCKNELLIAN” GOES TO ABSOLUTE-
LY EVERY ‘STUDENT IN THE ‘UNIVERSITY’.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 16, 1941.

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

by Walton Cloke
COKING AND SMOKING, TSK, TSK, TSK...

“Dissipation reaches a new high at Bucknell as recorded by the
' Bucknellian, We have come upon sad times when a university builds a
place for “coking and smoking”, (ye gods), and a paper published by

the students of that University hails the new monistrocity as something
that “will deepen our traditions”...tsk, tek, tsk. American educa-
tion hite a new low.”

This littie gem was extracted from the Brown and White, the stu-
dent publication of Lehigh University, and after noting its contents one
would gather that the “boys”, we hesitate to call them men, at Lehigh
just don’t go in for cokes, and in general they are against our drinking
them.

Now this seems a little unfair to us. After all do we tell the “boys”
of Lehigh that we don’t approve of foaming bumpers? Not at all.
We're not looking for something te fill up space in our columns.
ing bumpers are all right with us, in their place, Bucknel! men are not
immune. But we get a great deal of pleasure out of smoking a cigarette
and drinking a coke. And if we can do it in company with our coeds, at
a place where Bucknellians gather in mutual friendship, and bull session
to their hearts content, we receive double enjoyment for an evening well
spent.

No we don't have to be told by these “tittle big-shots” who, since
their parents have sent them to school, are now too big for their britches
what we shall or shall not do. If this so-called eolumnist in the Brown
and White stil! possessed the finite amount of intelligence he was born
with he might be able to see beyond the foaming bumpers that he feels
makes him a man of the world on his own campus, and realize that cok-
ing and amoking on the Bucknell Campus WAS NEVER MEANT TO
PLEASE HIM. In short, he would mind his own business, and before |
he steps into a controversy concerning co-educational colleges he would
do a little research work. And after doing his research work he would |
remember before he speaks, that the best and most honorable way to
onceal one's ignorance is to keep one’s mouth shut.

-O—T—
WHERE IS THIS PLACE BUCKNELL?

Tt seems that during the past several weeks Bucknell has been
aken across the coals in several different ways We have also heard
from a reliable source that the Tartan, the student paper of Carnegie
Tech, never heard about Bucknell

During the settling of football schedules immediately
past season, the students at our sister Pennsylvania institution of lear
ng received by way of the grapevine that the so-called mighty team of
Carnegie Tech was scheduled to play some little jerkwater sch
Allegheny Mountains named Bucknell After making quite a joke of
the situation, the Tartan was bold enough to say, “Where this Bu
nel

Foam-

following the

n the

Well we won't quibble over the matter, we aren’h going to play the
boys fr Tech, although we think it might be a good idea to pin their
ears back, but as far as Bucknell being a jerkwater school, we would like
to make an issue of that little matter. We maintain that Bucknell and
her neighboring college institutions are very well known. If you don’t

believe that, just ask Dartmouth where Franklin & Marsha!) is located

have such teams as Sigma Chi, Kap-

Alpha Epsilon, Lambda Chi Alpha,

And now for the finals. Who will

compun last Saturday that was wit-
nessed by far too few of the students.
The occasion was the presence of
‘Amos Alonso Stagg, the famous
Grand Old Man of football, Mr.
Stagg, who was visiting his son, the

coach at the College of Pacific.
(grand old gentleman, Mr. Stagg said
a few words to the basketball squad
and everyone else who wae fortunate

To the keen interest of the

owe the idea of publishing the book,
“TOBACCOLAND, U.S. A.” Jt is a
comprehensive picture story about
the growing, curing and processing

that “the meetings will be very in-
formal and will be more or leas con-
ducted along the lines of a bull-ses-
sion. We will talk about the basis
or fundamental ideas of religion and
try to get a better understanding of
the different faiths, and I believe
that with understanding comes toler-
ance”. In their meetings, the group
will discuss any frictional problems
that arise on the campus between
various groups. Through these dis-
cussions an attempt will be made to
solve the problems as brought before
the group. |

-|Dr. Walter H. Sauvain, Assistant

Professor Of Education, Designs Novel
Schemes Which Tell A Story In Stamps

by John Bush

A man apart from the ordinary run
of stamp collectors ia Dr. Walter H.
Sauvain, assistant professor of edu-
cation and acting registrar at Buck-
nell University.

He is one of the revolutionaries in
the philatelic world and his exhibition
of novel stamp displays which bedeck
his office in Taylor Annex and _ his
home at 1413 Market Street, Lewis-
burg, bear out this statement.

For thirty years Dr. Sauvain has
been gathering stamps from every
corer of the universe The phila-
telic project is his own design and
he claims he gets a big kick out of it.
As his collection became enlarged, Dr.
Sauvain ceased to delight in merely
collecting stamps and pasteing them
in bound volumes. He went a step
ahead and designed nove! schemes
which tell a story in stamps.

Take for example his African
stamp map To complete this he
took a map of Afrien and placed it
in a frame and then added stamps
from everyc ountry on that continent.
Pieces of red thread and red_ stick
pins were used to join the stamps,
tordering the design, to the countries
they represented In one glance 3
geographical story is unfolded before
your eyes via the stamp mart.

Dr. Sauvain’s novel exhibit of
stamp collecting covers a broad field
and is by no means confined to sports.
One display which he prizes very
highly ia the one which tells the story
of education. In a huge frame he
has carefully and systematically ar-
ranged hundreds of stamps which are
representative of the various subjects
and courses taught in schools and
colleges. There are stamps depicting
study in languages, music, and even
child care, His display of stamps
relating to mathematics contains the
portraits of Leibnitz and Able, two
of the greatest mathematicians in

AFRAID TO DREAM:

This is Elimination Week. Just
as theatres observe Sereeno and Bank
Night, and as drug-stores and soda
fountaina signalize One-Cent Weel
and National Milk Week, Bucknell is
celebrating its Semi-annual Elimina-
tion Week. Master of ceremonies is
Grand Eliminator Romain Rivenburg,
aided by Assistant Master Elimina-
tor Martha Henderson.

GIVE ME MY SADDLES:

There seems to be a decided ten-
dency on the part of the fair sex
towards boots these wintry daya. So
far, there are white ones, black ones,
green ones, white ones, pink ones,
white ones, blue ones, and white ones.
Others are white.

Probably the result of one of two
forces; the sheer masculinity of it
(attempt to wear the pants at Buck-
nell), or the pure utility of the boots.
Those white ones are certainly pretty.
DEATH IN THE AFTERNOON:

Everyone trying to dodge the
grippe germ by not associating with
grippe-veteran friends is sort of a
joke. The little bacteria float around
everywhere, and it probably doesn’t
make much difference where you come
in contact with them. (The author- |
ity for this statement is the knowl-
edge of three pre-med students; un
less they missed their calling I won't
have to change mine) |
THERE'LL BE SOME CHANGES

CORRECTION

We would like to take this op-
portunity to correct & mistake in
the Column, Campua Society, of
last week. Caroline Minner, '41,
announced her engagement to
Melvin Cressman, during the
Christmas Vacation.

Jackson's little black books, please

forward to Smiling Jack.

HOW TO GET THE GALLOPING
CONSUMPTION:

The Student Board of Health has
appealed to many Bucknellians not
to date and dance, because “dating
and dancing distributes disease”, say-
ing on top of this that classroom
doors might be closed if enough casea
of the Awful-awful develop. What
two stronger incentives to get the
grippe could be offered.

FAMOUS LAST WORDS:

Lota of groupe like to criticize
others in the light of their own
achievement This leaves a lot of
organizations in the dark most of the
time. The Bucknellian last week en-
gaged in speculation without antici-
pation of precipitation A feature
article entitled ‘Valley has little
Snow and is plenty cold” was a mis-
calculation on the part of Buelmetlian
weather experts (all of them). The
day before last week’s issue appear-
ed, it snowed and sleeted to a suffi-
cient degree to change all plans and

few headlines.

a relapse against Franklin and Mar-

shall and Muhienberg in their first

two Eastern Pennsylvania Collegiate

league battles, Bucknell’s varaity |

courtmen snapped the undefeated
atreak of “Doggie” Julian’s Muhlen-
berg passers from Allentown, last

victory before a Davis gymnasium
audience of less than 300.

Albie Baker and Bob Noian start-
ed the point-adding for the Bisons
a few seconds after the initial tap-

defense, the duo managed to grab |
the ball off the Muhlenberg back-
board and returned it to the Orange
and Blue sector before the Mules
knew what was going on

tive shots through the hoop while the
Allentowners gazed on with aston-|
ishment.

The K. D.’s had a novel and entertaining party Saturday when the

gather that the rink owner was more than glad to aceommodate the

of mopping up the floor for him. By actual count they are supposed to

have fallen down twenty times, tch tch!

Bucknell Men Retaliate
As Coeds Adopt New Fad

|

When the vogue for women's gloves shaped like boxer's mitts reached
the Bucknell campus at Lewisburg, Pa., men students rebelled because the
new fad made hand-holding with their girls impossible. In protest, the
men in turn donned regulation boxing gloves before calling for their
“dates,” with the result pictured above. Taking part in this particular
“boxer’s rebellion" are (from 1. to r.) Marjorie Hopwood from Pittsburgh;
Dan Richarcson, Pelham, N. Y.; Ruth Howley. Drexel Hill; and William

My dear James and Ma: /

I was so delighted to get your letters, } had been waiting what seemed |
uch a long time, but I see by the dates of yours that you had answered quite
on. FT was afraid they had been lost in coming or kept back by the censor
I think, James, what you say about the war is perfectly right and that
we are likely to have o terrible time of it before it is finished. Today there
have been many air raids on Coast towns. I am hoping my home in Brome!
did not have them, I hear one was about two in the night

;friend. It is such a relief for me to get so far away from London, where

| The only sign of war being so many soldiers returned from Flanders and also
| aeroplanes flying low all the time. At this house they listen to the news on
the radio four times a day. TI am getting
wel read some of it in the papers, afterwards. The news is terrible at
present, but our Army is wonderful so we hope for the best. Everyone ix
working now so let us hope we shall succeed. 1 expect you have heard of
the miracle which happened when the Army was evacuated from Dunkirk.
It was marvelous that the Channel should be so calm and a mist rose to hide
our men from the Enemy. It carries out the words written in the little book
[sent you. We had a National day of prayer Just before and there is one of
Thanksgiving on Thureday for the answer.
Fach time you write, your weather seems to be the same as ours. Now
it is “cooking hot”, there has been no rain for two weeks, brilliant sunshine
all the time which is very nice for me.

Engraved plaques Suggested for
Points of interest on the campus:

Over the door of any one of the
four women’s dormitories: “Woman
is the maaterpiece”—Confucius.

On any fraternity house bulletin-
beard: “But what is woman? Only
one of nature’s blunders”—Cowley.
ALL IN FUN:

The University Glee Club, 68 walk-
ing advertisements for Bucknell on
their mid-semester tour through the
Kast (East Pennsylvania) returned
Saturday from the annual week of
advertising. Except for a night at
the Lincoln, private homes accomo-
dated the glee-men on the remainder
of the trip. Despite some of the
ridiculous reports, on the whole the
men stayed jin some very
houses—one had a mattress and a
bed; still another reported a bath.
LINGUISTIC HANGOVER:

(not open to German students).

Hitler, in his last speech to the
German people, said something to the
effect that, “Gieberstromber eck fien
der apheir der krieg”, which trans:
lated means approximately “We have
won the war; all we have to do now
is clean up a few last matters” (such
ar England, for instance).

Dorothy Thompson in her column
(she writes one tooo) in the N. Y
Tribune last week, entitled “Hitler's
Lost War”, said something to the ef-
fect that “ resistance by the Ge
man populus would be laconic; sta-
tistical experts are convinced of titu
bation, claudication, and subjuga
tion”, which translated means that
q Hitler has lost the war; all that
remains is for him to be cleaned up”
WE ARE NOT ALONE:

Tonight, for the first time ‘in the
short series of Post-Exam Jubilees,
the Professors will present a skit
about the student body. The idea is
to reciprocally squelch over-enthu
astic demonstrations where they
formerly have been without any
come-back. Not having done enough
damage separately at the end of the
first semester, they gather like cheer
leaders at the half at a football game
to pep things op and to show the
audience just what the score is
WE'VE SEEN VERSE:

To quote another famous author
“Do not ask if a man has been
through college. Ask if college has
been through him”—Chapin From
the looka ef some of the post-exam
cases in the infirmary, you can gen
erally tell when college has been
through a man; he hasn’t anything
else left in him.

THOSE 68 BUNDLES OF HEAVEN

AGAIN:

The Glee Club sang in more than
20 High Schools between semesters
If some of the performances were
deciding factors in determining the
colleges of the students in those

sector of the clase rather than the

EEE

Bucknell University was the hun-
dredth institution of higher learning
in the United States to receive legal
sanction and a charter. Today there
are only 9 other colleges in the coun-
try that are older than Bucknell, but
there are 1500 that are younger.

eeeses

When classes were first started at
Bucknell University they were held
in the basement of the Lewisburg
Raptist Church. Today 30 modern,
ecientifically equipped, buildings offer
1821 students the best in modern edu-
ation.

seeeee

Since Bucknell University wae
founded at Lewisburg in 1846, more
than 16,000 students have been en-
rolled in classes ranging from art
and music to pre-medical and enm-
necring of all types.

—_— os
During the early years of Buck
rell’s history it was possible for a
student to receive his room, board,

|laundry, heat, and light for the com-

bined sum of $22. Today a student
will pay as high as $300 a yeer for
reom alone.

Why The Merchants of
Lewisburg Say . . .

“WE PREFER THE BUCKNELLIAN”

FOR FORTY YEARS THE MERCHANTS OF LEWIS.
BURG HAVE BEEN SAYING, “WE PREFER THE ‘BUCK.
NELLIAN’.”

THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS BY PLACING
MORE ADVERTISING IN THE BUCKNELLIAN THAN ANY
OTHER MEDIUM ON THE CAMPUS.

THE REASON FOR THIS IS QUICKLY APPARENT

THE BUCKNELLIAN IS THE ONLY METHOD OF
COMPLETELY AND EFFICIENTLY COVERING THE EN-
TIRE STUDENT BODY OF BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY.

Would the University allow its pre-meds and engineers to wan-
der about the laboratories, experimenting with equipment any
way they saw fit, and then decide that such courses were im-
practical because they produced no results? Yet the Radio ;

It is indeed unfortunate that Bucisnell is losing her Radio ;
Workshop. It offered a medium for students to agquire prac
tical experience in one of the largest of modern occupational
fields. Thousands of young men and women find employment liens ¢ i" t down the track
in this field each year Because a group of irresponsible stu- Aw
dents, who had faculty supervision in natne only, have made a
glorious fiasco out of radio work at Bucknell, the University is
losing a laboratory which could play an integral part in fitting
Bucknellians for paying occupations when they are graduated.

Because « group of left-wing: intellectuals thought that
“mood”, “termperament", long hair, and jade cigarette holders
are adequate substitutes for ambition, and has wasted the allow-
ance given it by Student-Faculty Congress to carry on oe
Radio Workshop, the University has lost faith in the practical-
ity of student radio work.

GEORGE HAINES PACES
VARSITY ‘BIG FIVE’

——

Averaging nearly 15 points per
contest in Bucknell’s last three tilte,

George Haines, blonde-haired basket-
taller from Clarion, has stepped up

to first position in individual scoring
among his fellow courtmen, as the
Bisons wend their way into the clos
ing weeks of the Eastern Pennsyl-
vania Collegiate Basketball Confer-
ence.

Haines, sensational ecoring flash of
last season's Bucknell frosh quintet,
got off to a slow atart this campaign
and then suddenly sapurted in recent
contests to outdo Bison veterans in
ecoring honors,

Ed Glass is in neeond position with
Albie Baker, Joe Buzas, and Bob No-
lun. trailing in that order.

lethal right hand swings and counter
ed with a few of his own to make
sure of victory. After the fight, R
man, a true sportsman, spoke highly
of Jordan’s gameness and stamina

C.C. N. Y.'s August Cosolalini won
over Bud Northrup in the 135-divi
fon by scoring a TKO in 1:47 of the
second round. Northrup kept a tight
defense in the opening round, but in
the second Cosolalini broke through
and landed enough effective blowa to
atop the fight.

In the 127-Ib. tilt Art Kleindienst
dropped a clone decision to CCNY’
Al Seakin Seakin’s longer reach
nided him considerably in getting the
best of punch for punch exchanges.
Rleindienat realized that he was be-
hind on points, so he ratlied his
forces for a lont round attack. How

‘Butch’ Goes Traveling To
_ Havana During A Revolution;

Sees Sights But No Fights|Gives Dinner Party

by Betty Miles
Blissfully unaware of tho revolu-
tion seething and churning in Cuba
at the present time, Marion Buchl,
‘41, spent a glorious three days there,
seeing the country and enjoying the
recreation centers while Cuba’s po-

that the police force carried rifles,
Cuban society went on as per eched-
ule at least to Marion’s perception,
and all semblance of a political up-
heaval may have been a million miles
away. The revolution, a bloodless
affair, is at present a struggle for
(power between the warring big-wigs,
|co, to date, affairs in Cuba are being
\¢ arried on uninterruptedly.

knows her, returned on Saturday,

K. D. Jean Shoener spent the weekend visiting at home. A surprise ‘February 15, after a two week vaca.
birthday party complete with trimmings was given by Bunny Bunnell, /tion, during which she visited her
‘48, for her sister, Lorothy on Friday night. Twenty girls helped to arents in Key West, Florida, and

The Sigma Alpha Mu’s have a novel way of rewarding or punishing
the scholarship of the brothers. It’s called a mush and steak meal.
Those members receiving more quality credits than the previous semester
have steak and the boys whose credits lag behind those of last term are
foreed to eat mush. Worth copying say I.

Going into a more detailed descrip-
tion of Havana itself, she described
it to be a city similar to cities in the
U. 8. A. She found the department
stores much more beautiful than they
are here. Marion also thought the
cathedrals to be very beautiful. The
clubs of the city both rich and poor
are very attractive. The streets are
very narrow.

“The homes are particularly beau-
tiful in the suburbs”, said Marion.
She also added that if there are any
traffic laws, they are not in effect.
“They drive like mad down there”,
was her description of traffic condi-
tions.

Giving a more definite description

of the type of homes in Havana,
Marion described them as Spanish,
distinguished by door-like windows,
which are long and open outward
from the center. Since flies and mos-
quitoes are uncommon in Havana, no
glass or netting is necessary in the
windows. Another point of construc
tion foreign to most of us is the use
stone for floors.
‘Because of the termiees”, Marion
explained, “stone is more practical
ithan wood. Quite a bit of marble is
used in the buildings, too.”

In reference to the people, Marion
remarked, “The people down there
feel that the Americans should !earn

Spanish for commercial purposes

tend that the Cuban should learn
English” Spanish the lar age

DO YOU WANT B. U. MOVIES?

Bucknell students know that there is a complete set-up for
sound-movies in the Literature Building. Since we have the
fine equipment, why isn’t it being used? Why can’t we have
good shows on the hill?

The recently-formed Motion Picture Committee, whose job
it is too investigate various possibilities, has found answers to
these questions and many more. We can have a complete pro-
gram of “Class A” movies on the hill; and we can have them at
a cost that is ridiculously small—that is, if the students indicate
their desire for, and willingness to support them, The commit
tee has worked out a plan; now all that remains is for the stu
dents to signify their desire for regular movies on the Hill.
Will students support campus movies? Upon the answer to
that question rests the future action of the committee

The enlarged committee of the Cinema-on-the-Hill is now
considering plans for reviving motion pictures on the campus,
in consequence of the new statute outlawing the old “block-
booking” system which made the exclusive showing of “grade
A” pictures prohibitive to small moving picture houses.

Whereas the old practice forced operators to take half a
dozen “grade B" or “grade C” pictures in order to get one
“grade A” picture, the new law makes it possible for the small
operator to obtain a regular run of good pictures

The committee is sponsoring, for Tuesday, February 25th,
a picture based upon the life of Robert Burns, and the English
Department is cooperating by requiring students in World Lit
erature to attend. The committee hopes that this picture
shown twice on Tuesday, the 25th, (7 and 9 P. M.), will receive
sufficient support to warrant the committee’s presenting a
“grade A” picture sometime within the next month or two, in
order to ascertain how well a “grade A” picture will be patron-
ized without any department's “pushing” the production.

Upon the success of the “grade A” picture (the showing of
which will depend largely upon the support given to “Auld
Lang Syne” on the 25th), the committee can base its plans for
the future. The present status of the plans calls for twenty
showings per year, each to include “shorts”, previews, and other
attractions; and the cost of these twenty showings, it is estimat-
ed by the committee, will not be more than one doilar for the
entire year, based upon the participation of the entire student
body.

In the past, “grade A” pictures have always paid for them-
selves. Some have made a profit which was turned into a loss
by the “grade B” and “grade C” pictures that had to be accept-
ed under the old “block-booking” system. The committee is
convinced that under the new system good pictures may be en-
joyed on the hill at a cost which is almost negligible. —R. G.

and abets this continued cruelty Their habitual attendance on these
things is silent consent, and makes them almost as guilty as Holly
wood iteelf. They become first cousins to the jowers of the
bullfight

In brief, all kinds of animals are tortured to fu
light to cruel-hearted movie fans The slaughter

and our attitudes, like those of a Roman holiday, ar
up or thumbs down—either mercy or continued cruelt
that the tender mercies of the wicked are crue Which reminds vu
of the wealthy gentleman in Texas who, protesting against the cor
poral punishment of prisoners, was assured that it was practically
painless punishment. His answer was the offering of a large sum of
money to any official who would suffer this punishment. His monetary
reward is still begging for a volunteer. Like our college hazers, the
yelloweat and dirtiest one in the bunch is the one with the biggest
paddle

Horees in particular are given a dirty deal Their agonized
death groans are conveniently left out of the picture To one who
has seen at a distance and heard over a mile away the cruel cries of
wild horses as they are “broken” for domesti yze on the western
Kansas prairies, we shudder as we slightly appreciate the death strug-
gles of these helpless beasts. Every time you see o horse fall head
long, stretched out in all shapes of horrid cruelty, you can assure your
self that he has suffered and died for ur entertainment. As many
as six horses are killed in the filming of a single picture, as well as
mistreatment for many others.

There are several methods used in the merciless affliction. of the
animals of the movie world. Spectacular and sensational effects are
produced by hidden pitfalls, the forcing of horses into blindfolded
jumps down precipitous mountainsides, by remote control through
wires attached to their forelegs, and worst of all by instruments of
torture worthy of the Inquisition, to prod on reluctant beasts to their
doom. Many stories are told of various animals. Huskies, the trans-
portation kings of the far north have been starved to force them to
fight wolves, One elephant, forced to cross a bridge against his bet
ter judgmenj, had blood oozing from over a hundred wounds—and
what a thrill we probably got ott of that one!

We are well aware that the Hays office of the movie industry is
constantly trying to raise the standards of the films. Many fine men
are cooperating with him in this worthwhile endeavor for wholesome
recreation. We know that their efforts are often futile, because pub
lic support fe more often in the gutter than in the hills. If we want
cleaner movies, let us cast our ballots at the box office, the only crit-
erion that Hollywood understands. If we desire wanton cruelty t
dumb animals, our tacit consent is atl that is necessary: just keep on
going ,

But let us remember that he who digs a pit shall f e
that even if Hollywood leads the pack on the ipeliathes sad Tas an
to the everlasting bonfire, we too shajl have ringside seats.

Tomorrow night, Bucknellians take their best bibs and tuckers down

the echoes of the Gym since Shaw.

What we want to know is “Will this be the last in big “name” bands

great many Bucknellians that if one of the class dances, hiring a “name“
band, takes a dive into the red side of the ledger, it will be the sudden
death of Bucknel! dances headlined by big names in danceland. In short
if tomorrow night’s dance is a financial failure there will be a shortage
of such names as Glen Miller, Glen Gray, Will Osborne, Kay Kyser, Artie
Shaw, and Benny. Goodman at Bucknell’s class dances.

If for instance one of the class dances turns out to be a dud, and
after the last theme song is played the committee can’t possibly put

supply the necessary funds? To ask any other organization or even the
college to stand back of a rubber check is something that just isn't
cricket, besides if you can find just such o Santa Claus you've solved a
lot of problems for campus organizations.

It is entirely up to the student body. If Bucknelliana want to con-
tinue with select bands for the big dances, the patronage wil! have to be
excellent to keep the financial results out of the red.

GRAIL OF MERIT

One of the principal aims of any college fraternity is to
serve as a rounding influence in shaping and coloring a young
man's college career. Fraternity has as a primary purpose the
task of discovering a host of diversified interests 1n the men it
pledges each year, and uniting these interests into a workable
and well-balanced pattern which will contribute to the prestige
and advancement of the fraternity, but which will, in a larger
phase, give added meaning and significance to the ndividual’s
four years of college experience

What fraternity at Bucknell best itself, its na
mater, ar ts men in furnishing thi ding influence
Which one of our 11 Greek brotherhoods contributes most t¢
Bucknell each year by encouraging its men to shap¢ their col
lege activities so as to broaden their interests, increas¢ their ca
pacities for the duties of responsible campus citizenship, and
motivate their ambitions toward constructive service to the
Bucknell community

A group of men from the Interfraternity Cc uncil is coope
ating with Dean Page and Mr. Paul Hightower this sernester in
an effort to determine which social fraternity at Bucknell is most
outstanding in the above respects. Dean Page's group has
drawn up a “table of merit” which will be used in ascertaining
which fraternity contributes most to Bucknell during the course
of a year. Each house will be judged on a point system, includ-
ing such things as scholarship, athletics (both intramural and
varsity), scholarship, number of men in honoraries, and the
number of outstanding men in extra-curricular activities.

The primary purpose of this judging will be to pick a fra
ternity winner for a new trophy which is being awarded next
fall by Rush Kress, prominent Bucknell alumnus, “to that fra
ternity group which has contributed most to Bucknell during
the course of a year”. The cup will be presented at the first
chapel after convocation next fall. This year’s activities will
serve as the basis for awarding the cup.

The new “Rush Kress Cup” represents the most worth-
while trophy which has ever been offered to Bucknell fraternity
groups. It is true that our fraternities are often considered to
be “cupped to death”. This may or may not be the case. How-
ever, here is a trophy which seems to emphasize the achieve
ment of the most vital function of fraternity.

It is a common tendency of fraternities to “specialize”, and
-neglect a diversity of interests for concentration upon one activ-
ity. Thus we have “athletic houses “scholarship houses”, and
“gocial houses”. This tendency narrows and cripples the ideals
upon which true fraternity is based, It has been pointed out
that fraternity is supposed to present a rounding factor in a col-
lege student's career. If too great an emphasis is placed upon
one phase of campus activity, this primary function of fraternity
is completely lost.

The new Kress Trophy will be a step in the direction of
eliminating this activity-specialization evil. It will be a level-
ing influence, motivating all Greek groups toward a diversifica-
tion of interests which will in turn lead to a more valuable sys
tem of fraternity life at Bucknell.

‘SUGAR AND SPICE’

When the final celebraters of Bucknell University’s g5th
Birthday trooped out of the huge dining room of New York
City’s Hotel Astor late in the evening several wecks ago, they
ieft behind them a very beautiful but unfortunately very perish-
able monument. The gigantic birthday cake, more than three
feet high, which had been concocted especially for the gala occa-
sion by one of the city’s greatest chefs, stood forlornly on the
banquet table, its gaudy icing and elaborate spangles reflecting
sadly the glory which had been its destiny but a few minutes

ago.

The festivities were over, and the great mountain of pastry
had served its purpose efficiently. It had had not one crumb of
jts delicious interior nibbled, | But that had not been its desig-
nated purpose anyway. It had been a symbolic addition of
color to a great American university's celebration of its g5th an-
niversary.

MORTAR BOARD
CHAPTER TAKES REINS

The ‘‘Rec” Room in the basement of
Hunt Hall, a newly-created ‘coking
and smoking” center and the result
ef four months of planning and in-
terior decorating, will be opened to
general use at a “surprise” ceremony
this Saturday afternoon at 2:00
o'clock.

The room will offer a number of
fucilities to both men and women stu-
dents, among which will be ping-pong
tables, bridge-tables, a fire-place, at-
tractive Venetian blinds. the sale of
food, and a lately-installed coca-cola
enachine.

The committee, consisting of Dean
Dyer, Janet Cristadora, ‘41, and Elsa
Butterworth, '41, began plans for the
room early last November. Princip-
ally through the close cooperation of
President Marta and Dr. Mary Wolfe,
of the Board of Trustees, the task of
setting the room up has been accom-
plished so rapidly.

The new recreation room will be
furnished in the very latest in play-
reom furniture. The opening cere-
mony is being planned as a rea) occa-
sion for Bucknellians. It will have
all the pomp and ceremony of New
York's “First Nighter”’ combined
with the collegiate atmosphere of
saddle shoes and ankle socks.

Interior decorations, consisting of
maple panels for the walle and appro-
priate fixtures for the soda bar are
being handled by John Wanamaker,
Ine. More than $1,000 worth of fix-
Sores will be installed in the room by
the opening time thie Saturday.

The “Rec” Room, as it will be
known, wiul be placed under the di-
rection of Dottie Derr, '41, a member
of the C. E. A. and of the local chap-
ter of Mortarboard. This will be the
first project under the recently-initi-
ated chapter of the national group.

Appropriate tags for all Bucknell
“first nightere” attending the opening
ceremonies will be given out at the
door. After the official opening the
Ree Room will be open to all Buck
nellians at all times, for their use and
eonvenience.

BUCKNELL’S LENTEN SEASON

With a majority of the world’s greatest countries in arms,
and ripping their own economic, social, and political vitals apart
with the fangs of war, the observance of the Lenten season, al-
ways such a sacred part of every Christian nation’s religious
doctrine, seems almost ironical in the face of the adversities
with which civilization finds itself beset from every side.

But it remains the sacred covenant of any nation and group
within that nation which is capable of so doing, to preserve the
spirit and meaning of the Lenten season, that period in the
calendar of the Christian Church which is undoubtedly more
filled with meaning and significance than any other

Such a task is worthy of the spirit and ambition of Bucknell
University, and the students on this campus have accepted this
responsibility with a vigor surpassing that of other years, be-
cause they have come to the realization, that the United States,
one of the last surviving democracies, must not only preserve
the political and social philosophy for which our country stands,
and upon which it was founded, but it must also carry on the
heritage of the Christian faith, must bridge the gap which has
been torn in the culture of the world by the ravages of sense-
less war.

, The Bucknell Christian Association has planned an exten-
sive program of addresses by some of the most prominent
speakers on religion in this country during March and April.
Mr. Roy McCorkle will be the first of these speakers on this
Sunday morning, and he will be followed by men of the same
calibre. Dr. John W. Thomas, successful worker with urban
and ethnic groups in New York City, Chairman of the Federal
Council's Committee on Cities and New Americans, and a con-
ference speaker of note, will speak the following Sunday. After
him will come Dr. Albert W. Bevin, famous author and lecturer,
and one of America’s most distinguished pulpit orators. Dr.
Paul E. Sherer will speak the next Sunday. He has often sub-
stituted for Dr. Fosdick on the latter's radio sermons over the
NBC hook-up, and is known for his writings, teachings, and
lectured not only in this country, but abroad as well. Rev.
Clarence Cranford will also speak during Bucknell’s special
Lenten program. Rev. Cranford is the author of the famous
boys’ book, “Larry”, and a speaker who has proven to have a
great appeal for students in his past Bucknell chapel lectutes.

The Lenten season at Bucknell has a greater significance
this year than it has even had before. Realizing this, the ad- |
‘ninistration has sought to bring to the campus during this |
time, men who will give Bucknellians assurance, confidence in
their religious heritage, inspiration to carry on the task which
has been so miserably flouted by those men who consider
themselves gods above all other gods, and who have forced upon

IT DID HAPPEN HERE

One of our fellow columnists says in his own copy this week “Any-
way they certainly pick nothing but the top-notch bands around here”
and believe-youeme he certainly handled a mouthful with that line.

Yea sir, we certainly know how to pick 'em at old Bucknell, in
fact we're running a close second to Bing Crosby, in fact we didn’t
even place, in fact we didn’t even show, in fact ave were left at the
post holding a slight deficit of $200, which ain’t fodder at any man’s
university.

Ob there won't be a scandal. There are not going to be any rub-
ber checks passed to cover the obligations incurred by the committee
It seams that the class treasury haa held in its mercenary maw the
not so nominal sum of $700, and all will be right with the world. In-
cluding Benny Goodman.

So everybody relaxes, and the Senior Ball Committee jumps on
the band wagon and waves the name of Tommy Dorsey under the col-
lective noses of the student body, not to mention Mr. Goodman and his
band, and once more tradition is saved at Bucknell for the nominal
sum of $1,750.

“So What?" says you. Well just this. Why in the name of com-
mon sense doesn't a class dance committee save itself a lot of head-
aches and hire a band that charges @ reasonable price? Why don’t
Bucknellians come down off of their high horse and admit that they
can dance to the music of a band that costs $800 as well as they can
dance to one costing $1,750. Why must Bucknell class committees bow
down and pay top notch prices to the mightiest mogols of danceland?

The answer to these last questions is quite evident. The Bucknell
dance committee even suggested a name like Raymond Scott or Johnny |

We have nothing against Mr. Goodman or Mr. Dorsey and we

WHY NOT DRAFT THEM

When the men on the Bucknell campus get their annual break
from the coeds on March 15, it would be a wise idea for the young
adies to bring their big night of the year up to date by “drafting”
heir datea instead of just inviting them.

The men are playing the part of the conscripted army anyway,
80 why not let them feel at home by dafting them. At least this is
one draft they won't try to dodge. Each young coed should have a
draft slip which she could present to the man of her choice, and after
he once receives it there should be enough strings attached that he
would be unable to slip the halter. At least this idea would put it on
a modern footing, and right in tune with the times.

But no matter how they are inducted in to the service for the
event the Bucimell male population is all agog over a big evening.
The part of the contract that calls for the young lady to pay the bill
eapecially appeals to a great majority of the men. Many of them will
make an all-out attempt to be as expensive as possibice, and we do
mean an all-out attempt.
change dances during the course of the evening. That will be one of

We understand that the young ladies have arranged for several ex-
the greatest things that ever happened to Bucknell lads and lasses
alike. Stag lines and cutting are unheard of at this institution and
even exchanging dances witha fraternity brother is frowned upon. So
we say more power to the coeds and their exchange dances. There is
no better way for Bucknellians to meet Bucknellians, and that is some-
thing this camptus needs,

the world a strife and orgy of suffering which has never been
paralleled in the history of the world.

Bucknell students must realize that this is the most mean-
ingful Lent in the history of civilized democracy, and must con-
tribute toward its significance with their hearts and minds
through their thoughtful consideration and interpretation of the
situation as presented to them by some of the world’s greatest
religious thinkers.

“What's in a Name?”

The Bard of Avon was right about the rose—its name
is unimportant. But if he'd had anything to do with
naming telephone exchanges, he'd have learned a lot!

Names must be easy to pronounce and transmit—niust
not look or sound like other exchange names—must
not use the same dial finger spaces,

Take MUIR and OTIS, for example. Fine!—exeept
they dial alike! For the first two letters of each appear
in the same finger spaces on the dial. =

Often hundreds of names are listed, studied, discarded
before one is found that mects all requirements. Such
care in every phase of Bell System work helps to make
your telephone service the world's finest.

Why nottelephone home often? Long Dis-
fance rates to most points are lowest any
night efter 7 P. M. and all day Sunday.

ASTRONOMERS ARGUE
OVER LARGEST STAR

Minneapolis, Minn.—-(ACP)—It’s 4
controversial world, and even the as
tronomers are having trouble agree
ing.

Recently a University of California
student came up with new figures to
show that Ras Algethi, in the con
stellation of Hercules, is the largest
star in the heavens. The astronomy
sophomore, George H. Herbig. said
his figures upset the previous theory
that the largest star was Antares, in
the constellation Scorpic

Now, however, comes Prof. William
J. Luyten of the University of Min
nesota astronomy department, who
says Herbig’s figures are not entirely
correct. Acually, he says, @ much
larger star is the binary “supergiant’
companion to the star Epsilon Aurt- |
gae, discovered in 1938.

There was considerable question for
a time about whether the supergiant
“rhost” actually wae a star because
§t emits only dark, or infra-red, rays

_|DR. DAVIS EXPLAINS
SUMMER PROGRAM

by Dr. F. G. Davis

For fifteen years Bucknell studente
have been taking practice teaching
either in the public schools during the |;
regular school year or in the demon-
stration school in the summer. Those
in charge of this work have felt that
a combination of summer schoo) and

lerable to the work in only one of |
these institutions.

After considerable study of the}
problem the department of education
‘has decided that beginning with the
class of 1944 the program of practice
iteaching will be as follows: Practice
teaching for everyone in the demon
stration school at the end of the
junior year followed by further ex
perience in the public schools during
the senior year. Thirty or forty
hours of actual teaching will be re
quired during the senior year. This
work will be done under close super-
vision and will involve conferences
|with the supervisor as well as with
the training teacher.

A more thorough training will be
available those who remain for th
fifth or master’s degree year In
this case, although the additional
practice teaching and seminar are at

that further experience would be
advantage to the student
There are two other reasons for
- program not heretofore mention-
Pennsylvania has set the require-
_ for practice teaching at 180
hours as compared with 90 hours
which was the requirement unti
about two years ago New Jersey

Pennsylvania requirements will be

eses it will be possible for studenta

The second reason for this progran

To make a long story short, they couldn't attend Coed Night if they
wanted to. They’re the Cinderella Boys of the school. In West College,
West Wing, Old Main, East Wing, East College’and in many of the fra-
ternity houses, they’l} bury their head in a book of organic chemistry, or
cry in their cokes at the “Rec Room”.

Once every year they have a chance to forsake their books and see
the bright lights at the expense of Bucknell’s coeds. But alas and alack,
there are only 400 coeds to take care of 900 men, so some poor guy will
have to sit at home. Not because he is a social outcast, not because he
isn’t a BMOC, (there are times when we wonder about that last one),
but because Bucknell has a shortage of women.

These fellows who, mathematictlly, don’t have a chance to attend
Coed Night are looking forward to March 28, you know,—Senior Ball.
That's the weekend every available Bucknell male will be in great de-
mand. Strange, isn’t it? We wonder how many of our coeds would sit
at home on March 28 if these 500 men set-apart imported dates for the
Senior Ball. Nasty thought, isn’t it? But wouldn't they have a very
good reason for such a procedure?

It seems that in one of the men’s dorms the boys have formed a
union that compels every man in the group, who gets a bid to Coed Night
to demand that his date also take one of his best friends. If the young
lady says, “No”, then the young man must decline her invitation. It
may smack of C1O, but they tell me it has points.

During « workout in the gym this week, your colum heard a
group of the boys who have received bids to the big event by Bucknell
coeds, discussing the matter. It was quite apparent that the boys not ed

“DO UNTO OTHERS”

A young American newspaperman was standing beside a
mud-slogge id in Poland when a boy no older than he, and
dressed in a few ragged remnants of what had once been a uni-
form, staggered up to the newsman and fell down upon the
ground to rest. As he lay, he told the American his story. He
had been a student in a university when war had struck. With
his class-mates he had been called to defend his Now
that country »t only been beaten but her peoy e beir
tortured by all the henic vhich could be devised by
the devilish mind of power-drunk tyrants The American's
eyes fell upon the boy's bare feet They were cracked and
bloody from miles of walking over frozen ruts. The boy, notic
ing the American aze, said simply, “I s and I

It is probably safe to say that no one in the world more
skeptical of so-called “missionary” fund-raising drive
American college student. None of us is endowed with a su-
perior brand of idealism which will compel us to empty the
spending money out of our pockets to be shipped away to bib]
pounders on some foreign strand whose avowed purpose is to
bring Christianity to a handful of head-hunters. But the great
majority of us construe every humanitarian attempt to give ma-
terial and practical aid to suffering peoples of our own rank and
station in life as a “missionary movement”, and hence excuse
ourselves from participating.

The Polish boy without shoes who whimpered until he met
a man without feet is only one of the million or more college stu-
dents who are either wandering along deserted roads in the war-
raped countries of Europe and Asia, or are starving and freezing
in concentration camps where they have been herded by the in-
vaders. It may be shocking to American college students to
realize it, but science has proven that the young men and women
in Europe and Asia today feel pain just as acutely, hunger just
as severely, and cold just as sharply as those of us who are for-
tunate enough to live in nations which are at peace. Because
they have been forced into a conflict they never wanted, have
been driven from their class-rooms and bombed until they can
scramble to the nearest shelter like rabbits, does not make them
any more insensitive to suffering than we ourselves are. Is it
“missionary work” if we contribute to feeding, clothing, and
preserving the lives of these unfortunates? If so, let us cast one
large, unanimous ballot in favor of missionary work.

than an

Can our individual nickles, dimes, and dollars be delivered
into the hands of the suffering students in Europe and Asia
without being dissipated away in organizing committees and
propaganda campaigns before they ever buy a loaf of bread or a
pair of shoes? The answer is YES. The way is open, on the
basis of reciprocal agreements so “airtight” that even Hitler and
his mob cannot destroy them, to help prisoners of all belliger-
ents.

This drive to solicit aid for students who are suffering from
the effect of war in Europe and Asia is being conducted by a na-
tionwide group which calls itself the “World Student Service
Fund Committee”. Aid to students and professors in prison
campa abroad is the special task of this group.

Today a group of ambitious Bucknellians, with the enthusi-
astic approval and cooperation of Dr. Marts, and Dr. Homer P.
Rainey, National Chairman of the World Student Service Fund,
started a concentrated four-day drive to raise a sizable Bucknell
donation to the cause of student refugees and prisoners of war in
Europe and Asia. Their job isa difficult and thankless one.
They have planned their money-raising campaign for weeks,
and they have piles of propaganda. They are attempting to
create an appeal to Bucknell students to aid suffering fellow-stu-
dents abroad. Need there be any greater campaign appeal than
a plea to Bucknellians to “DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU

WOULD BE DONE UNTO?”

While DuP has been making every-

CAROL BRUCE — If I Feel This
Way Tomorrow and I Should Have
Known You Years Ago. (Decca 3566).

Carol Bruce, currently appearing in
Broadway's “Louisiana, Purchase”
has a voice that ehould have appear-
ed long ago on records. As evidenced

on these sides it is delicate, lyrical, |

and relaxed, and has a very appealing
euality. If 1 Feel This Way Tomor-
row is an excellent tune and is almost
ture to be a hit if handled right. It’s
one of those songs that can best be
performed vocally. The other side is
a new one by Hoagy Carmichael from
the picture “Road Show”.

WOODY HERMAN — Boogie
Woogie Bugle Boy and Bounee Me
Brother With A Solid Four (Decca
a617).

Bounce Me Brother With A Solid
Four is another one of those things,
but it’s much better than most of the
scrub me, beat me, and bounce me
epice; and this despite Muriel Lane's
bad vocal. The other side is really
good. It's on the cute side, but
Woody's voca) and the band's drive
ere well worth hearing.

a percentage on the commission of a

Experts in Battle of Wits
There’s an old saying “Beware of

exsily be modernized into “Beware of
salesmen bearing gifts” You may
think you’re getting a bargain but
most likely you’re not. Just remem-
ber you’re up against an expert in
the battle of wits and he’s not going
{to give you anything for nothing. If
a salesman seema@ over anxious to
sell you one object in preference to
another, most likely it means that he
derives a higher commission from
that object Of course the higher
the price the higher the commission
--but also higher commissions are
given on things that the shop is try

most recent meeting Monday, March |

in the event of an imminent defeat
of Great Britain would our men be
sent across to the fields of fighting.

BADMINTON GROUP TO

MEET PENN NEXT WEEK

A group of six or seven Bucknell
boys interested in organizing a Bison
badminton team will demonstrate
their wares a week from this Satur-
Davis Gym when
they will meet a very good team from
the University of Pennsylvania.

Lending the badminton group is
Dan Richardson, outstanding member
of the varsity tennis team Other
members of the team include another
tennis player, Johnny Cronk, Tom and
Kill Rogers, and Stan Marshall.

The team is not supported by the
school and in their only trip of the
year, when they went to Philadelphia
to meet the U. of P., the boys paid
their own expensen Attempts are
now being made to have Temple Uni-
versity’s team visit Bucknell

For the first time in Bucknell’s his-
tory, one of the University’s lovely
seniors will be crowned queen of the
Senior Ball, when that annual event
takes place on Friday, March 28, in
the Davis Gymnasium. Until she is

Heckler, Inza McNabbe, Virginia
Engle, Janet Cristadora and Rachel
Carringer.

New Dresses In Order

A variety of color, style, and ma-
terial will be in evidence among the
gowns of the contestants. One will
model a striking gown of gold taf-
feta, with the bodice, which features
a yolk of white lace and epalets of
the some material on the sleeves,
swirling out into a very full skirt
with a small hoop. Light blue chif-
fon is the choice of another, with an
“all-the-way-round” tucked bodice, a
square neckline, puffed sleeves, and a
rather full skirt Another of the
finalists will wear a formal gown of
light orange velvet, with the draped
skirt set off by a slight train, and the
bodice finished by wide shoulder
straps, and a square neckline.

A heavy white taffeta, studded
with rhinestones, will also compete
for top honors, the full skirt molding
into a tight-fitting bodice with a hal-

will serve to set off the dress. “Deep

THURSDAY, MARCH 27, 1941.

by John Bush
FACULTY FLEETFOOTS____

Not to be outclassed by their
juniors, @ representative group
male faculty members have been
gathering in Davis gymnasium one
evening a week for the past several
months to demonstrate their athletic
prowesa and to recondition their phy-
sical frames for competition against
intramural winners on the campun.

Conceived by Bus Blum, the idea
of forming faculty teams is growing
in popularity among the professors
and administration members. Before
April rolls around, gym-master Blum
expects to have a volleyball team and
a handball team to pit against the
student teams.

Paul Hightower is the star of the!
volleyball team. Blum says that Paul
performs well near the net and is val-
uable in setting up plays on the of-
fensive. Hightower’s team scrim-
maged with volleyball team headed
by Harold Hayden on Tuesday night
with the former aggregation emerg- |
Ing victorious.

Dean Ralph E. Page had a small
audience during his performance with
the Hightower Holdovers. The Dean’s

team, it is understood, is anxious to

POTPOURRL.

While drilling indoors last week,
Chet Podd, Bison back, collided with
Al Kazary, a member of -the 1940
frosh team, incurring a slight frac-
tare of the right hand. It was the
first injury of the spring football
training workouts.

Bob Nolan is the only member of
the Bucknell varsity basketball team
who has elected to transfer his ath-
letic activities to the baseball dia-
mond this season.

Coach Humphreys is devoting the
initial spring drills of the ’41 football
condidates mainly to exercise rou-
tines. More than 40 aspiring grid-
men have learned that these workouts
are “real conditioners”. Several hours
of each day’s drille are highlighted by
relap races, rope-climbing, and cha-
riot-racing. Coach Humphreys finds
the rope-climbing drill especially
beneficial to linemen in strengthening
their backs and shoulders,

The boys play “piggy-back” too,
Johnny Waroblak got the assignment
the other day to carry Tom Rodgers.
Both ladé are heavyweights plus.
Waroblak dropped Rodgers after,
trudging several feet. Rodgers then!
attempted to transport Waroblak and
both fellows toppled to the floor. :

GREEK OPEN HOUSE... ~ a

If seeing is believing, then the crowd at last Saturday’s Greek Open
House, held in Tustin Gymnasium, is a positive sign that next year Buck-
nell’s fraternities can plan for their first real Interfraternity Ball. Prov-
ing to be a success far beyond the wildest dreams of Bucknel! Greeks,
the “open-house” really packed them in and the “Bucknellians” did ther
selves proud with an array of swing versions that were fashioned to
please the severest of swing critics.

The committee, handiing the first attempt at an interfraternit )
cial get-together, is to be complimented upon the succ t achieved.
To each fraternity on the campus should go the plaudits of the commi
tee, for the splendid cooperation the individual houses gave the central
committee heads. To make possible the arrangements for a separate al-
cove for each Greek society represented on the campus, the central co
mittee had to turn to the individual houses for furniture. In this respec

HORGUE EDITOR __..._.......___._-___._.—— Betty ‘Miles, This affair should truly prove to be a flying wedge to greater thing:

next year. There has long been a need for a social affair sponsored by
the united social fraternities on the Bucknell campus. Something that
could really be classed with the I-F Balls of sister schools and the tradi-
tional Ivy Ball that is the pride of Pennsylvania. Next year Bucknell
should be able to make its firat play for recognition in this field. Fror
now on the I-F Ball should mean as much to Bucknellians as Junior Pron
or Senior Ball, for the experiment has resulted in exeeptional success.

Dining Halls Hold Movie-On- The- Hill Presents -

‘The Howards Of Virginia’ in
Literature Auditorium, April 1

“The Howards of Virginia”, a pro-
duction of Columbia Pictures Inc.,
starring Cary Grant and Martha
Scott, will be shown in the Literature

7 and 9 o'clock in the evening; the
picture will be the second presenta-
tion this year by the newly re-organ-
ized Movie-on-t h e-Hill Admission

Directed and produced by Frank
Lloyd, the story of “The Howards of

Martha Scott playing as the Howards,
co-stars Sir Cedric Hardwicke and
Richard Carlson take the parts of o
rich colonist and of young Thomas
Jefferson, respectively.

In the filming of this revolutionary
war story, Columbia personnel and

equipment were transported from
Hollywood to Williamsburg, Virginia,

jwhere the setting for the historic

drama would be the actual acene of
the original action. Williamsburg,
Capitol of Colonial Virginia, was re-
stored through ® monumental twenty
million dollar project by John D.
Rockefeller, Jr., a few years ago, act-
ing through a corporation known as
Colonial Williamsburg Incorporated.

Scenes of the picture are taken in
the restored Capitol. the Governor’s
Palace, the Raleigh Tavern, and in
the homes and streets of the revived
Colonial town.

Rated as one of the outstanding
pictures of the year, “The Howards of
Virginia” is playing currently at ur
ban theatres all over the United
States. It has gained universal praise
for its accuracy in representation, its
comedy, ite picturesqueness, and its
brilliant acting.

thing and coupled with petty prejudices and superstitions, it readily
develops into a murderous complex. It didn’t begin or end in the first
century and anyone who tries to explain away or defend the dirty work
of his own church, in substance, is approving that foul chapter in its
history, and proclaiming himself as a member of a murder ring, born
out of due season. But whom the Lord loves he rebukes and chastens
and we personally regard it as a fine precedent We don’t want to
misjudge any institution or anygody, but facts are facts and by their
fruits we shall know them. “Am 1 therefore become your enemy be-
cause IJ tell you the truth?”

Someone is always taking away our Lord, and we know not where

to find Him. When we are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,
we lose our Lord; when we fail:to seek first the kingdom of God and
His Righteousness, the Lord fades away out of our lives. When the
lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eye, and the pride of life predomi-
nate. the Lord cannot exist in such an environment and finally when
Sunday is primarily a day of Sunday papers and feasting and sleep-
ing off the dissipation of the night before, some of our previous re-
ligic virtues will pass away.
_, But despite all the skepticism of our day, regardless of our real-
ists and unbelievers, the more substantial professions are constantly
bowing and saying “Robboni”, where dwellest thou, and what is the
solution of our problems, The pedagogue can never find better meth-
ods of teaching than those of the Christ. The psychiatrists and phy-
siclans are returning to religion for their best wisdom, and even theo-
logians are finding their Lord again. A strife-torn world of capital
and labor, and narrow nationalism have found no solution for their
problems except in their Lord of Love and of human worth. There
alone will they find their Lord and not in labor acts and leaze and lend
bills and propaganda.

Baseball Team | Johnny Cronk Wins

Prepares For
Season Opener

Tentative Line-Up Picked for

Susquehanna Game; Doenges
Is Probable Captain

by Dick Cassoff

With but. five days of practice re-
maining before the Easter vacation,
the Bison baseballers are now going
through their paces with the spirit
and jostle characteristic of Bucknell
athletes. As the baseballers drill un-
der the watchful eye of mentor John
qualities are
coming to light. In fact, Johnny has
a fairly accurate estimate of his ma-
terial and is prepared to issue a ten-
tative starting lineup for the Bison's
opener against Susquehanna’s Cru
saders from Selinsgrove

The probable lineup will find Phil}
Stamm on the mound with Forrest
Chilton behind the plate. Holding
down first base will be Harry Rey- |
nolds, q veteran of past encounters,
and Will Ronk will be at the key
etone sack. Filling out the double
play combination at shortstop will be
the veteran Harry Doenges, another
of the few veterans remaining from |
last season's starters Rounding out
the infield at the hot corner will b.
ERob Keegan. The Rochester lad, who
displayed his talents on the freshmar
basketball squad, is highly touted as

days after the F. & M. meet, the
team will open ite home season by
playing host to neighboring Susque
hanna.

A series of trial runs are being
held this week to determine who will
mepresent the team at the Penn Re
lays on April 25 and 26. The tear
fs entered in the mile relay on both
days. Four men compose the select
group and each man runs 440-yards
before passing the baton to the next
man. Last year’s team placed only
fourth, but with such a representative
lot to choose from, this year's quar- |
tet should fare much better. Con-|
tenders are: Capt. Ray Armor, Paul |
Damon, the intramural 440 winner. |
Farle Thomas, Bob Shaffer, Dave’
Culp, Carl Moore, George Good, Jack
Wilson, and Charley Schrieber, the
intramural cross country champion.
Of the group, Armor, Thomas, and
Shaffer. represented the team last

hoping for:

that th

year; Vic Cannestro, the other run- |j

ner, has been lost through gradua- |
tion. Armor is the only one who
seems to have assured himself a place
while any of the others have a good
chance to qualify.

For the past few seasons now, the
team has depended largely upon the
performance of the men in the run-
ning events, but this season the men:
entered in the field events have shown
exceptional promise. In the weight
events, are Cv Trecartin, Bill Palmer,
dim Reichert, and Frank Serrao. Mat
Weinberg. Farle Thomas, and Gil Un-
Tue are the hurdlers and Fd Glass is
the best of the high jumpers. The
Haug twins, Dick and Lou along with
Gus Cadwallader are the outstanding
pole vaulters.

Oh yes, the eats. Thanks to the
8. A. E. house, all the food was sup-
plied gratis. (In all, about a half-
dozen servings for too, Jeeves!)

Up to this time not a single penny
had stirred from the coffers of our
Bucknell sportsman. Since this par-
ticular athlete is a former employee
of the Hotel Lewisburger, the present
manager generously offered g room
in the “Burger” for the sweetheart’s
lodging.

Here's where X490 made the big-
gest discovery. The couple got into
the dance via a “service ticket” (that
lis an Annie Oakley or “free”, see).
That was all above board and in line
with the best ethical standards since
the host had served on the gate at
many dances in his eight semesters
of matriculation

I knew you'd start to wonder about
ithe corsage sooner or later. The ath-
Iete worried about it, later—and it
only cost him 25c. Just the same as
the other boys bought for their gals,
cnly his arrived at 11 p. m.—sorry,
he went after it.

They both enjoyed the dance, so
the story goes, so much in fact that
they didn’t have time to grab a sand-
wich or a drink of pop. (The water
was delicious)

Our athletic playboy re ally eplurg-
ed after the affair, however. Yes sir

to the tune of 10c—all for two coca
colas (with lemon)

Add up all the expenses and you'll
get a total of 35¢. Wow! How can

WHAT IS SO RARE:

Sitting in the Inp, the last lap, of
the grind now, everyone around Buck.
nell becomes interested once more in
the sun, Burpee’s gardens, and the
roof of the Women’s College. Spring,
bringing with it spring fever, hay
fever, and colds, is coming down a
one-way street into Lewisburg from
the South side.

Placement Bureau News

To aid Bucknell seniors in securing
positions after graduation, the Place.
ment Bureau announces that two vo-
cational advisers will arrive on cam-
pus next week.

Mr. Walter W. Leland, coming on
Monday, will speak to those seeking
accounting Jobs in the New York
area, while Miss Mary Townsend on
Tuesday and Wednesday will discuss
prospects with seniors wanting jobs
in the Philadelphia district.

Miss Townsend also wishes to meet
students who are trying for summer
employment. ‘

that everybody likes

With the stars, and with every smoker
who enjoys Chesterfield’s Definitely Milder,
Cooler, Decidedly Better Taste, Chesterfield is
known as the smoker’s cigarette.

Its famous combination of the best tobaccos
from our own Southland and from far-off Turkey
and Greece makes Chesterfield the one cigarette
that truly satisfies.

Campus Timepieces
Show Discrepancies
Reporter Observes

Best excuse in the world for some,
tut anathema to others, are those
varied types of mechanisms more
commonly known as clocks on the
Bucknell campus and in environs bor-
dering the 800-acre greensward.

For those late for engagements—
fine!

Ah, but for those who miss classes,
arrive downtown after the bank doors
have closed, or put in a late appear-
ance at the beauty parlor—well,
that’s different.

By observation, the clocks which
sre located in the popular spots on
the campus, haven't been right since
classes resumed after the Easter va-
eation.

Sometimes the timepieces, usually
bedecked with advertisements which
hide the hands, have been an hour
Jate, sometimes as much as two hours
behind time.

Very often they have been stopped.

SOS to campus business managers:
Step those clocks up into pace with
the progressive business you repre-
sent——or, pull the switch.

TENNESSEE CLAIMS TITLE

Knoxville, Tenn.—(ACP) — Scores
of colleges have been observing Sadie
Hawkins day, but the University of
Tennessee claims to have the original.

Al Capp, creator of Sadie Hawkins,
Li'l Abner, and other characters of
Dog Patch fame, and United Fea-
tures syndicate, have given Tennessee
sole claim to the title of “Sadie Haw-
kins Days Originators” on college

campunes,

As a feature of the recent obser-
vance at Tennessee, the campus pool-
foom was open only to women one
afternoon.

the civilian pilot training program by
June of this year will have given
more than 90,000 flight courses to
about 70,000 individuals. About fifty-
five thousand of these are college stu-
dents, since it is felt that advanced
education is an important advantage
in learning to operate a scientific in-
strument as complicated as the mod-
ern airplane.

Started originally to stimulate the
growth of private flying, the CPT

of favorite artists. Three represen-
tative samples may be cited when the
question of favorite selections is
brought up: “Black and Tan Fan-

tasy”, by Duke Ellington and his|

band; “Rocking Chair Blues”, with
Bessie Smith and the Mauch Chunk
Stompers; and “Serenade To A Shy-
lock”, featuring the Windy City
Seven.

Talking about this matter of fav-
orites—you might, of course,,

program was tremendously enlarged | tempted to ask if Lambert likes the

last June as Congress recognized its |“classical” music

new significance in the national emer-
gency as @ reservoir of pilot material
for the armed forces. More than
2,600 of its trainees have volunteered
and have been accepted for service;
and it is expected that many more
CPT students will offer their services
in June, when they have finished col-
lege.

Officials in charge of the program
point out that when the country re-
directs its energies to peacetime pur-
saita, the presence of 100,000 private
pilots (in contrast to 15,000 five years
ago) will furnish the basis for a vast
expansion of commercial and recrea-
tional flying, and predict that the
airplane may play somewhat the same
job-giving role as did the automobile
in the 1920's.

We Feel Bad
about Violets

ports always call the violet the shrinking violet.
We feel bad about anything that shrinks — but
chiefly shirts.
So we've spent our life
making the shirt that doesn’t
shrink, the ARROW shirt.
It’s Sanforized Shrunk, which
means fabric shrinkage less
than 1%. Its Mitoga figure fit
is superb and its collar is the
world’s finest. College men
everywhere prefer Arrows,

“_--As Advertised”

HOW OFTEN YOU SEE THESE TWO WORDS IN THE
COURSE OF A DAYS SHOPPING: “THI8 ARTICLE FOR
SALE—AS ADVERTISED”

AND THOSE TWO WORDS ARE AS WELCOME AS
THEY ARE FAMILIAR, FOR THEY FORM A BOND OF
CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THE MERCHANT AND YOUR-
SELF. THEY ARE HIS GUARANTEE TO YOU OF WORTH
AND VALUE.

HERE IS AN ARTICLE THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER. ITS MERITS HAVE BEEN TOLD.
YOU KNOWITS QUALITY, ITS UTILITY; YOU KNOW
HOW IT FITS YOUR NEEDS, AN WHEN YOU BUY IT, YOU
KNOW YOU ARE GETTING NOT SOME UNAPPROVED
SUBSTITUTE BUT THE SPECIFIED ARTICLE AS REPRE-

SENTED.

IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT PRAISE
“—AS ADVERTISED” CREATES A FEELING OF CONFI.
DENCE. YOU HAVE LEARNED TO DEPEND UPON CON-
SISTENTLY ADVERTISED PRODUCTS. YOU KNOW
THAT THE MAKER HAS CONFIDENCE IN THEM, ELSE
HE WOULD NOT SPEND MONEY CALLING THESE AR-

TICLES TO YOUR ATTENTION WEEK AFTER WEEK,
AND MONTH AFTER MONTH. YOU KNOW THAT THEY

HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE MOST CRITICAL OF
INVESTIGATORS—THE BUYING PUBLIC.

AND ABOVE ALL YOU KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE
THAT BUYING GOODS “—AS ADVERTISED” IS THE BEST
INVESTMENT YOU CAN MAKE.

Netmen
Up Win Over
Lafayette, 6-3

Victories in Three Doubles
Matches Clinch Tilt
For Visiting Bisons

by Sy Berger

Playing the superb brand of tennis
shown in their opening match, the
Bison netmen went on to chalk up
their second victory last Friday, April
18, when they downed the Lafayette
courtmen 6-8, on the latter's home
eourt. But before the weekend was
over, the Bucknell lads were taken {n

hand, and dropped a 3-6 match to the |

racket-swingers from Rutgers. As a
result, the Bisons have two victories
to one defeat for their young 1941
intercollegiate tennis season.

The lads from Easton were perfec
hosts, enabling the Bucknell squad tc
fnsert another marker in the victory
eolumn Freddy Griffin, our No. 1
piayer, met some tough competitio
fn Lafayette’s Jack Quinn, but afte
a hard-fought first set, which Freddy
finally took, 9-7, he disposed of Quinn
in quick-fashion, 6-3.
racket in the No. 2 slot, Joe Culbert
fon was no match for Spence Danby
and despite Joe’s best efforts, the La
fayette stylist took the match, 6-0
6-2. Johnny Cronk’s game seemed t
lack its usual polish as he went down
to defeat at the hands of B. Stuhler.
Johnny battled his formidable foe
but is game just couldn’t reach its
par as he lost, 6-3, 6-4

Bob Rink tied the match up at
three-all with a beautiful three set
victory over 8. Bluestein. Bob garn
ered the first set, 6-3, but the Lafay
ette No. 4 player came back to cop
the second, 9-11. Bob finally turned
on the pressure taking the next set
¢-4, and also taking the match. Dan
Richardson showed some of his old
form in winning a gruelling three-set
victory from R. Sahadi. The blonde
Bucknellian dropped a stubborniy
fought first set, 7-9, but came back

take the next, 6-3. The third set was |
nip-and-tuck, and with Sahadi ahead, |

5-4, Dan rallied to take three games
in a row and win, 7-5. Representing
Rucknell in the No. 6 slot, was Tow
Burne, who was outclassed by Kadish
fn straight sets, 6-2, 6-0.

The score stood at 3-3 when the
doubles began. But, the Bisons swept |
through and raised it to 6-3, as a re-

Amid many errors and plenty of
hard hitting on the part of all the
teams, Intramural softball leagues
opened week. Lack of practice

However, when the season get well
under way, a few of these teams,
with some of that much-needed prac
tice, will prove to be heavy contend-
ers for the finalist trophy

SAM H—SC 9 |

In a very important game, the S.
A. M.’s took the measure of the Sigs,
y getting off to a very good and fast
tart by scoring six runs in the first
inning. The Sigs tied the score at
6-6 in the fourth, but the Sammie
ball players bounced back with 7 tal
hea in the fifth canto to “ice” the con
test.
PKP 14—MDR 13

Hard hitting on the part of both
teams, with a surprisingly small
number of errors, was the chief char-
cteriatic of this “pitchers battle”.
The outcome was never certain until
the very last inning, when Wilkinson

crossed the plate with the winning |

by Ralph Bolton
In their opening match of the year
the Bucknell linksmen started the
season off right by defeating the

West Chester State Teachers Cottage

four-man squad 6-0. Bill Johnson,
Bill Ramage, Jack Britton, and Wil

jbur Bloete did the honors for Buck-

nell bringing in four victory cards.
Paced by Bill Ramage's low scores

of 39 and 39 for the two nines, the

Bucknell men brought in the entire

lsix points of the match,

In the first foursome, Bill Johnson
won over Geinrich of West Chester 5

jand 4. Bill Ramage took his match

8 and 7. Johnson and Ramage took
the best ball match 6 and 4.

In the second foursome Jack Brit-
ton took hie match 7 and 6. Wilbur
Bloete won his from Paul Phillips 4
and 2. The two Bucknell men took
the best ball combine 4 and 9.

Ordinarily, the teams should con
sist of six men each but the West
Chester team brought only four men
to tangle with the four top men of

|Kucknell’s squad.
|

The fifth and sixth slots on the
Bucknell team would have been filled
last Tuesday by Fritz and Jackman.
The other prospects who have been
shooting good cards jin the practice
sessions are Bud Vanderbilt, who
played some varsity matches Iast
year, George Foster, Banks Brown,
and Bud Blair. All of these men

jhave been shooting in the eighties

and are hoping to lower their scores
and step into varsity posts with the
coming of better weather.

Nothing unusual happened through-
out the match except for an incident
on the eighth green when Will Bloete
was in a trap off of the green in two,
wasted a stroke, and then came out
of the pit to hole out on the blast
halving the hole.

The match this Friday with F. &
M. here on the Bucknell course is ex-
pected to offer stiff competition. F
& M. gave the Bucknell team one of
the two defeats it has received during
the past two years. The starting
up for the match is expected to
be, Bill Johnson, Bill Ramage, Jack
Britton, Will Bloete, Herman Fritz,
and Ross Jackman.

MEET JUNIATA TEAM
HERE THIS SATURDAY

by John Bush

Battling uphill from the opening
innings, Bucknell was forced to sure
render the lead in the season openers
with Susquehanna and Dickinson last
week, and the Bisons dropped two in
a row, 4-8 and 7-6.

For the greater part of each game
it looked like Bucknell all the way,
but Susquehanna U. and Dickinson
bunched effectively enough hits to
eke out @ one-run margin of victory.

| Phil Stamm did a commendable fob
jir silencing the Crusaders’ bats for

seven innings in the curtain-raiser at

|Memorial Stadium field last Thursday

afternoon.

The Crusaders managed to push
ecross a single run in the fifth inning
ind returned in the eighth frame to
rather three more rune Al Zava-
rich’s grounder to Harry Doenges
turned into a hit and the batter mov-
>d to second on a stolen base.

With a lone runner on the bags,

arry Ieaace planted the ball in the
Memorial Stadium cinder-path for an
automatic home-run Georgie Zue
yack followed with a double over the
ence in left-centerfield and then stole
hird. A “squeeze play” brought Za-
sack over the platter with the win-
ning run as Ford settled down a per~
ect bunt along the first-base line.

Bobbie Keegan opened for Bucknell
with a cireuit clout into deep center
n the fourth inning. Harry Reynolds
worked a free pass to firat and stole
‘econd. Cook solved the offerings of
‘Lefty” Krouse for a double and
Reynolds raced home with the second
un of the ball-game for Bucknell.

Both teams scored one run in the
ifth inning. The Crusaders got an
mearned run after Krouse was hit by
a pitcher ball, advanced to second on
1 ingle by Zavarich, and galloped
rome on a single by Isaacs.

Harry Doenges landed a safe single
in the Bisons’ half of the fifth canto.
thilton’s sacrifice moved Doenges te
vecond, then the veteran infielder
stole third. Bob Keegan singled to
‘ight-field to score Doenges with the
Bison's third and final run of the

game.
Bucknell led for two additional inn-
ngs only to experience a Susquehan-
na three-run rally in the eighth canto
and the loss of the contest.

To at least one player, however, the
change from battling the minors to
taking on major-league pitching
means nary a thing. Guisseppe Paul
DiMaggio (Daniel of the New York
World-Telegram calis him ‘Yussel’)
has not been stopped since he first
went to bat in Florida We don't
know in how many games he has hit
safely, but as of Tuesday his batting
average was .528. Unfortunately, we
confess that a great deal of it was
done at the expense of the Athletics,
and even Connie Mack admits they
don’t have any pitchers. Incidental
ly, what the Yankees have been doing
to the White Elephants recently
shouldn't happen

There are yme very peculiar

In the “We Love Our Veteran

Tex Carleton, who at this time last
year was pitching a no-hitter against
the Ciney Reds, has been released by

the subject, we feel very sorry for
Doctor Prothro ‘way down there in
his bomb shelter. Last year the Phu-
tile Phillies won about 50 ball games
Over 20 of these were taken by Mul-
cahy or Higby, and a few were won
by Marty’s hitting. Now Mulcahy is

from C. Pine by the tune of 6-4, 7-6.
But, Tommy Burns playing in the un-
familiar No. 2 slot put up a great
battle in forcing Norman Geller all
the way before losing, 6-3, 7-6.

Still smarting from his defeat at
Lafayette, Johnny Cronk displayed a
champion’s touch as he walloped E
Robinson, 6-0, in the first set, and
then easing up, but still managing to
win the second, 7-5. Bob Rink made
ft two weekend victories when he
easily trounced lanky 5. Sewitch by
the scores of 6-1, 6-4. Dan Richard-
eon experienced quite a lot of trouble
in 1. Megarger, and came out on the
ehort end of a 6-3, 6-8 score.

Carrot-topped Joe Culbertson came
up against Slobodien, who was a per-
fect double for Lon Budge. The Rut.
gers lad copped the first set, 6-4, but
Joe came back with a sparkling, 6-1,

John L. Collyer, president of B. F.

buseball campaigns, is an extremely
valuable man in the Sitaraky line-up.
| Though amall of stature, he has been
a consistent .300 hitter, and his field-
ing both at shortstop and third base
has always been outstanding.  Al-
though it is reported that there is a
possibility of his getting back into
the game in about two weeks, it is
feared that he has been lost to the
squad for the remainder of the year.

“Union Now” is a tide in the affairs of a great democracy, which,
taken at its present flood, will Jead on to a great victory for mankind.
Neglected, it will lead to dictators and totalitarian states and enslave-
ment. Let the dead bury their dead, but we who believe in democracy,
let us close its gaps with a united front.

There are hardly as many obstacles in a United Democracy ae
there are differences in the Protestant church. When Protestants
agree on the Lord's Prayer, whether we shall forgive our debts or for-
give our trespasses, about ninety percent of their differences will have
dissolved themselves, In the light of New Deal history, now is the
time to compromise on the word “debts”. And whether democracy is
a 1941 model or a model T, they all have similar engines, and rubber
tires and some kind of a body. Let's forget the gadgets and agree on
the essentials, for they that are not against us are for us. We are
traveling in the same direction. Let’s give them a lift We might
need one ourselves someday.

The good Lord made our body with two ends and a few append-
ages. One end is to think and act with, and the other is to sit on and
grow conservative. Which end are we going to use? Are you going
to wait your turn for a good swift kick, or are you going to unite
while there ia yet time? But in any case, you can bet all the scrip-
tures you know, that heads you win and tails you lose.

Houseparties Start

by Betty Miles

It’s really terrific! Or so we've been told. So we frosh gals are
looking forward with great anticipation (that’s putting it . mild), to
Houseparties, that event annual, and legendary, which will assail the
Burknell rampus with @ vengeance come Friday noon. Seems as if, how-
ever, no future event, be it ever so exalted, can slow the wheels of activ-
ity at B. U., so let’s cast a glance at the doings of Bucknell’s hopefuls
during the past week

—t87 (C9) a__

The members of Delta Delta Delta celebrated their Founder's Day
last Sunday. Everyone, or almost everyone, arose at 7:90, and a picnic
breakfast took place at Red Rock. A grand time was had by all, even
by those seniors who threw each other in the lake. Of course the pho
tographer hounds took many snapshots. A meeting was held in the
euite afterwards, and the story of the doings of the sorority for the year
was read. Everyone received a corsage of pansies a8 a finale.

The Tri Delts held a tea in Hunt Living Room last Friday afternoon
from four to six Members of the glee club sang several songs, while
Billie Poling rendered a group of solos, accompanied by Carolyn Minner
at the piano. The patronesses of Tri Delt were the guests at the tea

DOWN-BEAT:

The Intersorority Sing is next
Tuesday night. They're going to or-
ganize the noise that comes from the
sorority suites every day into a few
rollicking verses of “Going Home”
towards a cup for the suite mantel-
piece.

Seriously, the probability of future
{ntersorority and interfraternity sings
depends upon the support given this
one. The Phi Mu's, defending cham-
pione who captured the cup in the last
sing two years ago will, from the
sound of all four floors of Hunt Hall
every afternoon, have to meet stiif
competition to keep the cup on the
first floor suite (probably some one
wants to know how the Buecknellian
staff found out the Phi Mu suite was
on first floor!)

HUGE STUDENT AUDIENCE

B Club Aided by Hightower
As Minstrel laterlocutor;
Glee Club Performs

The Varsity Show, which was spon-
sored by the “B” Club, proved a big
success before a large and enthusias-
tie audience at the Lewisburg High
School last Thursday night.

The show opened with a gala en-
trance of the band, Glee Club and
minstrels from the rear of the audi-
torium. After the company had
taken their places, the show swung
into action with the minstrels keeping
up a eteady stream of jokes, songs
end dances. Paul Hightower with
his Texan draw] was the interlocutor.

Bob Morrison as Rastus and Bob
Teter as Andy put on @ very amusing
barber shop skit satirizing the barber
talents of Hank Peters, The audi-
ence especially enjoyed the cracks
that were aimed at the students and
faculty members. The big hit of the
evening, however, was the May pole
dance by Al Humphrey's Beef Trus-
ters. These fellows, dressed as chorus
girla, nimbly danced and sang about
the pole, becoming more entangled in
the ribbons the longer they danced.

The Glee Club and the University
Quartette sang several numbers, fen-
turing “Casey Jones” and “Frankie
and Johnny”. The show ended with
the full cast singing Irving Berlin's
“God Bless America.”

Townsend Discusses

stands now for a forgotten peace and
foreign policy We face today the
first alliance ever made against the
American people. Since England is
fighting our war, we must join with
her in a federal union to preserve our
nation.”

Agreeing that United States is in
the most dangerous period of its his-
tory, Dr. Schuman asked the audience
two major questions: (1) what ie our
stake in this war, and (2) who will
eoon have to fight it?

“First”, he declared, “this is a
death struggle between totalitarian-
fem and democracy; secondly, ‘we’
and ‘they’ confront each other. ‘We’
will presently be reduced to the
United States alone and ‘they’ already

f their lution for

consist of the aggregate whole of the ,

world.”

It is a purposeless effort among the
democracies, according to Dr. Schu-
man, that may lose our war for ex
istence. Dictatorships, on the other
hand, wield more force because they
have a fixed purpose—that of enslav-
ing the globe—and therefore are
fearless. Britain sees in victory but

a chance to re-establish the former ,

halance of power, while it rests with
America to construct a system of in-
string the safety of the democratic
peoples, a task Federal Union can ac-
complish.

In reply to objections that the plan
{a too idealistic, Dr. Giddens, of the
political science department at Alle-
gheny College; Dr. Vernon Nash, na-
tional director of Federal Union; and
Pr. Ernest Meyer of Bucknell in a
conference Saturday morning stated
that it is no more so than was the
consolidation of the early American
colonies 150 years ago.

Preceding adjournment of the con-
vention late Saturday afternoon, came

VARSITY SHOW PLEASES |. Francis Lybarger, Bucknell
Alumni Secretary, Is Orator, =
Lawyer, And ‘Contact Man’) Masic Arranged by Professor

by Shelton Barnett

In 1928 a group of students repre-
senting 650 American colleges tra-
veled westward to engage in the
finals of the National Intercollegiate
Oratorical contest held at Los An-
geles. Among this group was a
young Bucknell student who was rep-
resenting Pennsylvania at the con-
test. When the winners of this na-
tional contest were announced, this
student brought honor and prestige
to Buckaell by coming out in fourth
place among the top collegiate ora-
tors fo the nation.

Today, some thirteen years after-
wards, this man {s still representing
Bucknell, but now in a different ca-
pacity. He is Bucknell’s Alumni Sec-
retary, I. Francis Lybarger. Mr.
Lybarger is Bucknell'’s “contact man”
He is continually on the move, tra-
veling for the college, presenting to
hundreds of prospective Bucknell stu-
dents scenes of Bucknell! life that he
has recorded with his camera. Mr.
Lybarger’s pleasant manner, and his
natural, native ability to present in
word pictures the facts, truths and
advantages awaiting them at Buck-
nell have produced results which are
now reflected in the fact that the col-
lege is filled to capacity this year.

Mr. Lybarger was born in Mifflin-
burg and attended achool there. His
father was for twenty years a noted
speaker on the Chautauqua circuit
until he retired to practice law in
Mifflinburg Among Mr. Lybarger’s
circle of friends was included William
Jennings Bryan. For eight years the
elder Mr. Lybarger maintained a sil
ver trophy that was presented to the
winner of the local high schools de
bating contests.

From his early boyhood Mr. Ly
jbarger, Jr. interested himself in pub-
lic speaking While {in high schoo!
he participated in debating, and suc
ceeded in winning his father’s award
while still a sophomore. In 1924 he

ity was quickly recognized by Profes-
sor Coleman and Roy Howes, who
were then coaching debating. Under |
their expert tutelage he became one
cf Bucknell’s foremost orators. At
that time debating received almost |
as much attention as football does,

that when debates were held, old
Convention Hall would be packed, and
crowds of people turned away. For
three years Oxford University sent a

In 1928 he graduated from Bucknell
with an A. B. degree. After college
he became assistant to his father in
his legal practice at Mifflinburg. He
became prominent in civic affairs,
and was elected Justice of the Peace,

by Betty Miles

Seems no time at all since mother was decked out in a budding cor-
sage, ad presented with a picture for “that certain empty corner”—and
yet, a glance at the calendar tells us that its Spring Festival time once
more, and time for Bucknell mothers to be the guesta of their cherished
offsprings at the annual Mother’s Day celebration. So here’s “Hello” to
Mother’s Day weekend, and, just by way of “Goodbye to houseparties”,
lets turn the clock back, and look over last week’s events on campus.

— 6.

Howard Gale and his orchestra played for both the formal and semi-
formal dances at Kappa Sigma, and a buffet supper, held on the back
lawn, rounded out the festivities. The tables carried out the theme of
Kappa Sigma colors in scarlet, white and green. The favor given to the
guests of Alpha Phi was a brown leather compact with the Kappa Sigma
crest stamped on the cover, This favor was autograpable,

Guests at Sigma Alpha Mu were presested with a gold brooch, mono-
grammed with the fraternity seal. Bruce Bell and his orchestra sup
plied the music for the house. Jack Schechter, chairman, Harry Tuman
and William Roos, constituted the social committee. Returning alumni
were Donald Robinowitz, '89, Manny Pearlman, ’39, Leon Berke, '39, Paul
Alpert, '39, Norman Tractenberg, ’39, Marty Alpert, ’40, and Floyd Van-
derwart, ’40.

The Sigma Phi Epsilon’s ushered in their houseparty weekend with
a formal dinner dance Friday evening Banquet tables were set in the
den, which was decorated in a traditional motif, displaying the fraternity
seal and colors, with a large banner as the center of the display On
Saturday afternoon a picnic was held at Half Way Dam, and Saturday
night the dance was informal. Louis Phillips and his Lycomians provid-
ed the music on both evenings.

Kappa Delta Rho celebrated houseparty weekend with Ralph Wright
and his orchestra providing the music for dancing both Friday and Sat
urday night. One section of the house was decorated as a summer gar
den, with a large arbor covered with vari-colored rose buds. The other
side was decorated as a ball room, with a revolving mirrored ball. Half
Way Dam was the scene of a picnic for guests Saturday afternoon

Natural leather compacts and cigarette cases, bearing the fraternity
insignia, were the houseparty favors of Sigma Chi. The house was at-
tractively decorated with a laurel covered canopy leading from the porch,
and the spring theme carried throughout the decorations. Chet Lincoln
and his orchestra played for the Sig houseparties.

It's stilla mystery! There are few secrets that are ever kept in this
world, but the identity of Buckneltl’s May Queen certainly appears to be
one of them. The powers that be on the matter are closed tighter than
any clam could ever possibly hope to be, so it looks as if this is really one
time when we'll really have to see for ourselves, (Plug).

Kappa Delta “Tats” McLeavy visited her sister in Newark, N. J.,

Marie Roversi, all '40, visited the chapter this past weekend.

A gold plated jewel box, lined with velvet, and bearing the fraternity
seal in gold, was the gift of each Phi Gam to his respective houseparty
date. They, too, used a South Sea Island theme, with the guests enter-
ing through a grass hut with a thatched roof, which graced the front
porch, and the same motif carried oat inside, with caricatures of the
Fiji's throughout the house.

A spring scene furnished the background for the Lambda Chi house-

leyball and hiking a» the chief diversions, was held at Cowan Saturday

So goodbye to honseparties. Goodbye to swishing summer formala,

Goodbye to houseparties, a fitting climax to a social season that swept
from September to May in one grand, spectacular whirl.

Reporter Reminisces
Over Houseparties;
Weekend Round Of Fun

It’s over now, and all that remains
of the big weekend of houseparties
is memories, It was indeed a gala
affair and one that could not very
easily be surpassed. Fellows and
girls alike had a grand time tearing
here and there, and doing no work for
three days. (That is a rare event,
elthough the professors often won-
der).

Friday night, there were a few
dinner-dances, but for the majority
of Bucknellians, the big weekend did
not begin until 8:30 or 9:00 p. m.,
when dates were scheduled for danc-
mg at the house. It was on Friday
hight that the girls received their
favors, which, in every case, were
beautiful gifts that would very easily
srouse fond remembrances of house-
parties at Bucknell, May 2nd, 3rd, and
4th, in '41.

On Saturday, there were numerous
rienics. At this time, Bucknell men
and women wandered into the wilds
(anyway there were a few bushes
around), and enjoyed the blossoming
beauty of nature in the springtime.
Then, some returned to the campus
for the track meet against Dickinson,
which neidentally, Bucknell won.
A baseball game against Drexel was
an additional drawing card at the sta-
aium, and many houseparty couples
watched Bucknell down the team
from Philadelphia to the tune of 5-1

Saturday night, co-eds and men
gain danced at the house. The eve
hing was drawn to a close at 12:80,
when Bucknell women had to be back
at their dorm

The majority of houseparty dates
had dinner at the respective houses
on Sunday, and in the calm beauty of
a quiet Sunday afternoon, the week-
end came to a perfect close. There

no doubt that the '41 houseparties
were a success, and few Bucknellians
will soon forget the fun they had last
weekend,

LOVE IN DEATH

Never shall death and darkness hold
for me

The terror of a melody that stops,

But when the bird of death from
heaven drops,

From ‘neath its jet
shall not flee.

Across expanses mournful, to
jaws,

O sooty shades, O perilous stretch of
sharp

And bristling dangera—to the golden
harp

Across whose atrings an unseen hand.
sweep draws.

black wings I

thy

The quaver of a deep-toned twang
will sound,

Its sulfur-yellow tinkle pour through
space;

The saffron straina of mortal love,
new-found wil

Amid thy murky net will interlace.

Oh, if in death, thy gilded trillings
bound,

I shall through clouded, veiled night
gladly pace! —Hope Briggs.

Onginal Paintings
Of American Artist
Will Be Exhibited

An exhibition of original paintings
and sketches by Henry Varnum Poor,
one of the best known contemporary
American artists, is being held in con-
nection with the Spring Festival at
Buckne!l University, from May 8 till
May 15 in the lounge on the second
floor of Roberts Hall.

Several of the chief stages of the
artist’s development are included in
the exhibition, from early still life
and later figure subjects to recent
landscapes done in Colorado and
Pennsylvania. The pictures admir-
ably reveal his technical virtuosity
and the wide range of artistic media
he has at his command. The exhibi-
tion is of particular interest to Buck-
nellians because of the portrait of
President Marts which the Class of
1939 commissioned Mr. Poor to paint
and which will soon be completed.
The show has added local interest be-
cause of the fresco that Mr. Poor re-
cently completed for the Old Main
Building of the Pennsylvania State
College which has been acclaimed by
many critics as one of the finest
murals in America.

Tea will be served at the opening
of the exhibition by students of the
Bucknell Art Department. The paint-
ings will be on view to the public
throughout the Spring Festival, and
afterwards, from 2:00 to 6:00 p. m
éaily, until Thursday, May 15

Floral Theme,
Colorful Costumes

by Betty Miles

To the usual whacking of the
racket against the ball, the whipping
of the ball through the basket, ths
flying of the arrow toward the bull's
eye, and the sight and sound of num-
erous other activities, Tustin Gym-
nasium has added the whirr of the
sewing machine, the echoing of vari-
ous folk tunes, and the beat of danc-
ing feet. In brief, preparations for
the 1941 Spring Festival are definite-
iy under way.
Mies Derr, assisted by Miss Geil,
is centering thie year’s festival
around a floral theme, with the girls
cleverly costumed in accordance with
the flower they represent Tulips,
(amgiias, holly heoks, peonies, sham-
rocks, Scotch thistles, and a wide
variety of flowers will be in evidence,
sporting skirte of vari-hued crepe
paper petals, and hats that carry out
the flower motif. The girls will do
dances typical of the country which
one would associate with the flowers
they are portraying.

With the advent of spring, the May
| Day participants have taken to the
great outdoors just beyond the girls’
| tennis courts, while several rooms in
Tustin have been converted into sew-
ng rooms, turning out some 96 fin-
ished crepe paper products that would
| be suitable rivals for Schiaparelle
| Molyneau? and the gamut of the de-
igning world. Whatever may be the
design or pattern of the costumes,
Tustin Gym Sewing Shoppe can
| handle it

This weekend will mark Bucknell’s
| 27th observance of May Day. In 1934
the Spring Festival as it is known to.
day was inaugurated, a May Day pro-

jgram only being presented previous
to that time.

For the seventh consecutive year,
Miss Sylvia Derr will put the Festival
through its paces. Since the presen-
tation of the Rip Van Winkle pageant
in 1934, she has produced a succes-
sion of colorful May Day pageants,
which have been presented each year
to the Que and her court Thia
year’s festival does not bid fair to be
an exception

So once again its Maytime—and
that means the May pole dancing, the
pageant, the entire festival, the tulip
beds and the green, green lawn, the
sunny summer’s day (we hope), and
the crowning of the Queen herself.
Pack we go to the dream days of our
very early childhood. Its Spring
Festival time at Bucknell!

An investigation disclosed some of

and sitting through an exam with
one’s legs crossed.

College seniors are supposed to be

seems that “Old Man Superstition”
plays an important role in their
school lives. One graduate-to-be

BUCKNELL U. WILL OFFER

NEW GEOLOGY COURSE

Professor Louis C. Peltier Will
Teach Course in Physical
Geology in September

Avalanches and earthquakes wil!
visit the Bucknell campus in Septem-
ber when Professor Louis C. Peltier
cffers the new course, Physical Geol-
ogy 103, wherein students will use
miniature models to watch at first-
hand nature’s processes in creating
rivers, mountains, and other geologi-
cal formations.

Because of its practical, illustrative
methods, the course is so unusual that
elready Clark and Harvard universi-
ties have commented favorably on it.

Students will work with small-scale
modele, as for instance one using oil,
sand, and water so combined as to re-
construct an oil well, that will elim-
inate mathematics and simplify the
phenomena involved in the develop-
ment of geological and topographical
structures.

By means of these working models,
the purpose of the course is to clarify
the evolutionary steps followed in
jondslides, glaciation, drainage, de-
rosition, earthquakes, ground-water
movements, and the forming of oil
wells and mountains. For example,
a model will operate to show in a few

From One To Five

With this issue the new staff takes over “The Bucimellian”.
The year before this the working editorial staff of the paper
numbered one; this past year five people have been truly active
and now there are fourteen persons in new positions on the
masthead.

During the year “The Bucknellian” was edited by Bill
Crum, a man who did his best to improve the paper and to make
it a cooperative staff venture. The genuine pleasure of his as-
sociates in working for him prove better than words how well
he succeeded. Student interest in the paper grew and during
the two collegiate press conventions this year “The Bucknell-
ian” carried off the major portion of the cups.

But an eight-page paper cannot be put out every week of
the school term by a working editorial staff of five persons
Sooner or later mistakes creep into the news stories, the copy is
inaccurate sometimes and the headlines get incoherent and dull.
Putting out a good paper becomes impossible and the work is
sheer drudgery when carried on by so few people.

In the coming year the masthead is not going to carry
names known only for their promises. If on it there are people
who shirk and show no responsibility, these names will be re-
ported to the Board of Publications and then dropped.

Every single person on the new staff has proved so far he or
she can work, and well, The staff is pledged to a paper of ac-
curacy and interest. Everyone knows his job and we sincerely
hope that the results will show in a new and better paper.

The Year’s At The Spring

The ancients had true wisdom when they set aside a day
each Spring for the celebration of the vernal season. Originally
a pagan rite, May Day festivities have come to be regarded as
really joyous and Christian customs.

In England the traditional Spring dances and collection of
flowers for May baskets began many hundreds of years ago. It
is with a feeling of nostalgia that we must realize now that only
here in America have we the opportunity to carry on this pleas-
ant, peaceful custom. Instead of May flowers, the English are
gathering up the remnants of their homes, instead of listening
to folk music, the populace of Britain is listening to a harsh and
more terrifying tune, made by air raid sirens: and shrieking
bombs.

We have so many things to celebrate in America this
Spring that our annual festival here at Bucknell should take on
a new and deeply significant meaning. Perhaps it isn’t quite
proper to bring up such serious thoughts on a gay occasion like
this, but let us rather look at it in another light. Spring means
re-birth of all those things that we hold dear, and our festival
commemorates this. It means the re-birth of our values, our
ideals and our faith in God and nature and ourselves. For this
reason we should reflect a little as we view our green and lovely
campus this Festival Weekend.

EVELYN DAY TO SING

FOUNDED ON CAMPUS |

The “Bucknell Graduate Club” in-
cluding all the graduate students of
Bucknell University was recently or-
ganized following a popular demand
for such an organization.

A constitution and by-laws were
drawn up at the organization meet-
ing ond the following were electtd as
officers of the new group: Lacille
Cook, president; Bob Stanton, vice
president; Alice Moore, sec.-treas.;
and J. A. Ramer, program director.

Primary purposes for the organiza-
tion of a graduate club as outlined by
Bob Stanton are to promote an inter-
est among undergraduates in grad-
uate studies and to gain recognition
and privileges from the Bucknell Ad-
ministration.

TONIGHT AT 8:15 P. M.

In one of the two major individual
concerts of the month, Evelyn Day,
‘41, will sing tonight in the Baptist
Church at 8:15 in a senior recital
sponsored by the Bucknell depart-
ment of music.

Accompanied by Darina Tuhy, she
will sing four groups of songs; they
are German songs by Franz Schubert,
kussian selections by Rachmaninoff
and Stravinsky, four numbers by
English and American composers,
and two arias, one from Thomas's
“Mignon” and the other from Puc-
cini’a “Tosca”.

Stolz Comments
On Song Contest

Declares Mu Phi Epsilon
Staged Song Contest
With Success .

by P. G. Stolz

The campus is very much indebted
to the Mu Phi Epsilon musical or-
panization which successfully spon-
sored the Inter-Sorority Song Con-
test at the Baptist Church on Tues-
day evening. Six of our sororities
competed in the contest.

Delta Zeta, the first to appear, is
a small organization and gave evi-
dence of hard work with splendid re-
sults. The Phi Mu’s appeared next
and were the fortunate organization
to receive honorable mention by the
judges. Their results were commend-
able but improvement can be brought
about by stressing tonality. The Tri
Delt organization, which was the win-
ner of the plaque, showed evidence
of detailed attention to the various
voice parts. They are especially to
be commended on their dynamics.
The Alpha Chi’s were inclined to be
ragged and sluggish in their attacks
end releases but there was evidence
of fine balance, Pi Beta Phi had ex-
cellent material but unodubtedly fail-
ec to apply hard work. They lacked
spontaneity. The Kappa Delta’s ex-
celled in genera] fine spirit and show-
ed careful thought and training.
They were probably on a par with
Phi Mu who received honorable men-
tion and undoubtedly had the best
soprano section.

The judges who graciously served
in the contest were Mra. Mary Rich |
of Northumberland, and Miss Kath-
erine Reed of Sunbury.

More power to Mu Phi Epsilon to
make possible such encouraging mu-
sical competition on our campus. May
we expect a fraternity song contest
next year? How about it, Alpha Mu
Beta ?

Day program on Saturday morning
at 11 a. m. The push-cart race has
always supplied its share of thrills
and spills during past years. The
rivalry developed over the annual
race haa led to the improvision of a
varied assortment of racing carts to
be manned by eight of the fleetest
pushers from each fraternity. The
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity are the de-
fendihg champions from last year.

The race will be divided into two
different heats. The racing cart hav-
ing the lowest time will be declared
the winner. The judges for the race
will be Bernice Henry, Paul High-
tower and Dean Page. A large cup
will be given to the winners.

The committee in charge of the
festivities consists of Dr. Gregory,
chairman, Ruth Braden, Bud Vander-
bilt, and John Kingsbury. The course

SPRING FESTIVAL, 1941

During the years that have passed since its inauguration in May,
1934, our annual Spring Festival has become the symbol of one of the
important aspecta of our life on the campus. ‘The central motif ef ths
Festival is the traditional May Day celebration in honor of the Queen
and her Court of Beauty. We have accepted the suggestion of this
charming ceremony to set aside each year a few days appropriately to
celebrate whatever gifts we may have for making life a more enjoyable,

and @ more abundantly creative experience.

Roselle, Armor, and Shaffer
Again Take Firsts As
Team Wins 8 Events

by Joe Barber
H nity weekend was the occa-
Dickinson was the opponent, and
a Buc! victory was the result, as
tne Bison track team overwhelmed
Dickinson 77-49 last Saturday after.
noon at Memorial Stadium for their
econd win In three starts Buck-
nell’s complete dominance in track
events was the key to their easy vic
tory. The Bisons accounted for seven
first places in the running events, as
Thickinson received only one first
place.

It was fortunate for the Bisons
that they did so well in the track
events, because they were outclassed
in the field events, where Dickinson
had a 28 to 26 advantage. Dickinson
won four of the six field events, while
Gus Cadwallader, who won the pole
vault, and Cy Trecartin who won the
javelin, were Bucknell’s only winners
in this department.

The meet was not without its sur.
prises. Ted Roselle, the Bisons’ Frosh
sprint ace, scored a double victory
when he won both the 100 and 220
yard dashes. Roselle annexed an un-
expected victory in the 100-yard dash,
when he defeated Cap. Ray Armor by
inches in a powerful, driving finish.
A little later, Roselle won the 220 by
shout a yard, in the good time of 22.8,
fo account for his double victory.

If anyone had the idea that Armor
was discouraged by his loss in the
100, they were mistaken, because the
lanky blonde speedster returned to
the track 15 minutes later and ran a
fine race to win the 440 by 10 yards
from his team mate Bob Shaffer.

Shaffer also served double duty to
win the half mile; but before he com-
pleted those 880 yards he had to do
quite a bit of fancy stepping. Shaf-
fer led until the last 220 yards, when
Len Smith of Dickinson challanged
him and passed him on the laat turn
Smith held the lead until the two
swerved off the turn into the straight-
away. Then Shaffer unleashed a ter
rific drive that brought him a 10-yard
triumph In the excitement of the
last 60 yards, Smith foided up eom-
rletely and Bucknell’s Bob Snyder
passed him to finish second.

The two mile run was won by Carl
Moore in the fair time of 10 min.
49.6 sec. Groh, of Dickinson set the
pace for a mile and a half, but Moore
passed him on the seventh lap, and
never let up until he had a 25-yard
lead at the finish.. Jim Ham trailed
Groh by 12 yards to assure Bucknell
of third place.

Stamm Hurls Three Hitter Against Drexel

To Give Bison Nine First Win Of Season
Kappa Sigma Softballers Take

First In League

I; Sammies, Sigs,

And §.A.E.’s Tie In League II

by Eldridge and Culbertson

With the annual softball league
drawing to a close it looke like the
outcome in League 2 will be as close
as a traditional National League fin-
ish. At the time of this writing only
two days of playing are left before
the playoffs begin and a three-way
tie exists in the above mentioned
league. By virtue of their victory
ever the Sig Eps on Tuesday the 8.
A. E.'s were automatically lifted into
a first place tie with Sigma Chi and
Sigma Alpha Mu. In League 1 Kap-
pa Sigma'’s powerful team continues
to dominate the play and has clinch-
ed first place honors for the season.

According to the way that the
schedules were made out none of the
three tied teams will meet each other
before the playoffs. Each team has
one game remaining on the schedule
with the S. A. E.’s and S. A. M. fair-
ly certain of copping victories. How
ever, should the Sigs defeat the
strong 8. C. C.| aggregation an addi-
tional playoff will be necessary to
decide the winner of the league.

In the archery tournament, Bob

ship with little trouble. His eye was
keen, and his aim was true.

The golf matches are still being

Huge Co-Recreation Program
Planned For This Weekend

As part of the immense Spring
Festival program, the Bucknell coeda
will have an opportunity to display
their athletic prowess against the
stronger sex. On Friday afternoon,
May 9, amid the blaring of the band
offering the spirited Bucknell tunes,
the Spring Festival of 1941 will be
initiated.

The lads and lassies will take them-
selves to the various corners and
nooks of the campus and participate
in one of the largest co-recreational
programs ever witnessed on the
Bucknell campus. Out on the rolling
greens, the shuttlecock swatters will
pair off and see Row it is to cooperate
with the coeds, and vice versa, in bad-
minton. Tennis will be another fea-
ture of the program, and there's a
possibility that it might turn out
some men-beaters similar to Buffalo
University’s woman tennia star.

The disciples of William Tell won't
be called upon to put an arrow thru
an apple atop someone's head, but
the targets do have bulls eyes which
can be pierced by the skilled archer.
The tossing games, such os quoits
and horseshoes, will be another fea-
ture of thie grand  co-recreational
performance.

It is hoped that the intramurai
baseball tournament will reach the
semi-final stage by Saturday, May 10.
therefore giving the parents an op-
portunity to watch their sons go
through their paces on the diamond.

The committee is doing their ut-
most to make the Spring Festival and
Mother's Day a gala event on the
ever-busy Bucknell eporte program.

Frosh Star Also Contributes.

Heavily on Offense
in 5-1 Vietory

MEET MORAVIAN
HERE TODAY

by John Bush

Bucknell’s basebaliers won their
first game this year when they
trounced Drexel at Memorial Stadium
on Saturday, but that wasn’t the big
news of the ball game.

The things that counted were Phil
Stamm's superb mound work in al-
lowing Drexel only three safeties and
the gallant comeback of the Sitarsky-
men after the Philadelphia's early
one-run lead appeared as a safe mar-
gin of victory.

Drexel’s sole counter came in the
second frame after Capt. Bob Clyde
reached first on an error, moved to
second via the illegal route and then
bounced over the plate when Bud
Landis singled into right field.

In the fifth inning, Phil Stamm
opened the Bison bat-barrage with a
single. Stan Schilder hit a red-hot
bounder to shortstop Landis who had
dificulty in handling the pill and the
Brooklyn mite reached first safely,
Stamm moving all the way to third
curing the sequence. Schilder stole:
second but Stamm, one of Bucknell’s
speediest diamond stars, rested com-
fortably on the third-sack.

Eugene Cook selected Hal Evans’
initial offering and pasted it over the
short left field fence for a double,
driving in Stamm and &childer.

The Bisons insured victory by a
wide margin in the eighth canto with
three more runs. Bob Keegan's clout
was good for two bases and a few
seconds Jater he scampered home on
Will Ronk’s sharp single to left field.
Forrest Chilton, batting for Harry
Reynolds, reached first base on an
error. Both runners advanced a peg
and then Stamm took his turn at bat.
He lifted a high fly into left field and
three Drexel ballplayers permitted
the ball to drop to the turf. It was
an expensive error since Ronk and
Sehilder scored on the miscue.

Notes on the Geme

Coach Sitarsky’s smile has return-
ed and there's a healthy glow in his
cheeks—all because our Bisons won #
game. (P. 8—The skipper lost s
pound with each Bucknell defeat;
that’s six Ibs.)

eseete

When the track handlers started to
place the low hurdies on the cinder-
path, which splits the right and cen-
ter gardens, Coach Halas of Drexel
immediately thought of subversive
ectivities and ask for an explanation.

Bisons To Run In

Middle Atlantics

Eleven Men Stand Fine Chance

in Meet To Be Held This
Weekend at Allentown

The Bison track team will have its
hands full when they travel to Allen-
town to compete in the Middle At-
jantic Championships tomorrow and
Saturday. Last year’s championships
~were held at Easton, the home of La-

fayette, the winner being Rutgers.

This vear the Bisons should do
much better than they did last year,

when they placed low in the stand-
ings. The team is very much strong-
er than last year’s outfit. There wil!
be twelve other teams competing be-
sides Bucknell. They are: Lehigh,
Lafayette, Rutgers, Ff. & M., Dickin-
son, Alfred, Haverford, Juniata, Dela-
ware, Washington University, and
&t. Joneph's.

In three starts, the Bisons have
‘won two meets, and lost one. Sus-
quehanna and Dickinson have already
fallen victim to the Bison forces,
while F. & M., the perennial jinx, in-
flicted the only defeat.

It is not yet certain who will make
the trip, but according to the form
shown so far this season, eleven men
awill probably make the journey to
Allentown, Sprint men Armor and
Culp; distance men, Moore and
Schreiber; field men, Serrao, Trecar-
tin, Thomas, Weinberg, Knupp, Shaf-
fer, and Snyder, 440 runners, will
probably compose the select group.

Armor in the 440, and the sprints,
end Shaffer in the half mile, look like
Bucknell’s best
ehampiosships.

With five victories and but one de-

quer. On Wednesday, May 7, they
met the Dickinson squad, and on Sat-
urday, May 10, they come op againat
the highly touted Muhlenberg net-
men, who boast some of the best in-
tercollegiate players in Pennsylvania.

Sr

Earle Thomas has been bothered
considerably by a pulled tendon, but
if he is in shape by Saturday he
thould place well in the hurdles,
which is his speciality.

Unfortunately for the Bisons, the
freshmen are not allowed to compete
in the meet. This means that the
services of Ted Roselle, in the sprints,
Gus Cadwallader in the pole vault,
and Frank De Angelis, in the broad
jump will be sorely missed.

Queen, the annual pageant is present-
ed to Her Majesty and her Court.
This year's pageant tells no definite
story, but rather is a Festival of
flowers. Between 90 and 100 girls

‘are participating in thie festival,

which combines color with quaint
charm. ‘The musical accompaniment
of @ 28-pieco orchestra is under the
direction of Professor Charles Stick-
ney. Miss Sylvin Derr directed and
planned the May Day Fete.

At the conclusion of the pageant,
the May Pole dance is given. This
dance is presented by 28 junior girls,
chosen for their grace and ability to
perform the intricate steps involved.
One of the time-honored features of
all Spring festivals, this event lends
a good deal of color and beauty to
the occasion. d

With the performance of the May
Pole dance, the festival will draw to
its clone, and the crowd will disperse
only to assemble again at various
spote throughout the weekend.

In the event of rnin, the pageant
will be held in the Davis Gymnasium.

and

Bucknell The Mother Of Us All

Bucknell, the foster mother of ali Bucknellians, iz highly honored
by the visitations of Bucknell mothers on this weekend. We trust as
you witness, the unfolding of your dreams, that you may recall the
travail of your soul and be satisfied. No one but mother knows
the anguish, the vicarious sacrifices, and the anxiety for a child that
will never bring reproach or sorrow to its parents.

Bucknell frankly admits its inferiority complex in ce ntrast with
the filial affection of the student body toward their blood-related
parents, but it makes no apology, whatever, once it has assumed a ma-
jor role in their adult education. The preliminary role of # mother's
affection and guidance and character building is « foundation pillar
which determines the degree of success that Bucknell can import to
her foster children. We acknowledge this day, the indespensable part
that Pucknell mother’s have already contributed, and we promise on
our part to carry on to greater perfection the task, so well begun by
yourselves.

Year in and year out the spirit of motherhood of Bucknell watches
over your sons and daughters and leads them on the path of achieve-
ment and success, They are acquiring characteriutics of responsibil-
ity and serious purpose, and before you will realize it, trey will be
occupying important roles in life.

Now that the German government

from America will proceed through

Since Spring Festival, Bucknell’s last really big weekend has whirl-
ed itself into a state of complete oblivion, we Bucknellians have settled
down to what promises to be a comparative lull in the campus machine,
pending the dawning of exam week, hanging over us in much the same
manner as the pendulum over Mr. Poe's very black pit. But, being reso-
lute optimists at all costs, let’s turn the clock back to last weekend, when

all was very rosy—(in a purely literal sense)—and take o look at
Mother’s Day Weekend—’41.

Delta Sigma alumni brother James Duchine, 40, who ie now working
at Heidelburg College, in Ohio, returned for Spring Festival weekend.
John Koehler, '44, visited Bloomsburg State Teachers’ College over the
weekend. Demies who were visited during the Mother’s Day weekend by
their parents and relatives included: Bob Fredrickson, Dick Nutt, Les
Whitney, Bill Carson, Don Hopkins, Harry Johnson, Don Scholl, Bill Con
ger, Al Ashman, Billi Hauk, Curt Clump, Bernie Hieber, and Bill Trick

More than thirty mothers, fathers, and friends were entertained at
the Lambda Chi House over the weekend. Jim Schuessler, '42, and Yank
Anderson, 42, visited their homes over the weekend. Bill Crum, '41, er
tertained Jean Levan, ’40, over the weekend.

Sororities Fete

Mothers During
Festival Week End

The mothers of the feminine
Greeks on campus were feted by the
sororities of their respective daugh-
ters to Sunday breakfast in some
cases, a tea in another, and a banquet
in still another as the local sorori-
tiea added their own touch to the
Mothers’ Day festivities.

Eta chapter of Alpha Chi treated
the Alpha Chi mothers to a breakfast
at the Lewisburg Inn at 9:00 o’clock
Sunday morning. The singing of
sorority songs added to the merri-
ment. A special feature of the break-
fast was the traditional presentation
of a corsage of violets to all mothers
and guests. The violets are gathered
oy the pledge group each year early
Sunday morning. Helen Roberts, Le
Anne Boyle, and Marge Corwin con-
tituted the committee in charge of
the affair.

An informal breakfast was held on

nday morning in the Tri Delt suite
for mothers of the local Tri Deltas.
Each mother received a red or a white

| carnation, and songs were sung by
the girls. Betty Hyde acted as chair-
| man n charge of the breakfast, and

nmittee consisted of Lois John-

n, Izzy Kent, and Didi Mitchell.

Gay Colors, Stripes,
Polka Dots, Favored
In Spring Campus Wear

As spring continues to awaken na-
ture’s beauty on the Bucknell campus,
co-eda have once more turned their
attention to what they should wear
this season. Already definite trends
are noticeable as light materials of
gay color have pushed aside more
sombre clothes universally worn in
winter.

This spring, as in almost every
other, eyelet and seersucker materials
are again popular. Sharkskin and
silk-jersey are still good, and hand-
kerchief linen has become a widely
admired material for blouses. As for
designa, stripes and polka-dots are
very good, as is exemplified by their
wide use on the Bucknell campus,
Flowered prints are in for afternoon
dresses, while materials without de-
sign are better for play outfits.

Many dresses, this spring, are
trimmed in ruffled lace, and there is
also a wide use of embroidery. The
sleeves are, for’ the most part,
straight and plain, witrout any puff.
Skirts are of a widely varying type.
They are flared, pleated, or plain nar-
row ones. Collars, also, are varied.
Peter-pans, broad shirt collars, and

In Near Future

Greek, calculus, and Latin are defi-
nitely not the only accomplishments
which one may attribute to the aver-
age Bucknell coed. This is evidenced
by the engagement and wedding
plana that have been announced by

Crossgrove, daughter of 8. J. Cross-
grove, 125 North 4th Stree, Lewis-
burg, to Howard Hartzell, was an-
nounced at Christmas. Mise Croas-
grove plans to be married Saturday,
July 5, in the Lutheran Church of
Lewisburg. Vivvie Dyer, Betty
Hitchcock, and Martha Rice, all Buck-
nell students of the class of °41, will
act us bridesmaids. Following the
wedding, the Hartzells will reside at
Crozer Seminary, Chester, Pa., where
Mr. Hartzell will continue his studies
in his chosen profession, that of the
ministry.

Cobaugh—Matchler

June is the probable date set for
the announcement of the engagement
of Miss Helen Cobaugh, '42, of Un-
dercliffe Road, Millburn, N. J., to
Charles Mutchler. Mr. Mutchler was
formerly a student of Bucimell, and

Fire Down Below

Just a few nights ago there was a devastating fire here in
town that left a desolate pile of smoldering ruins out of what
had been a large and prosperous business concern. Years of toil
and effort have gone into building this enterprise. The firm has
a position of repute and dignity in the commercial realm of the
community.

Then early in the morning a tiny blaze broke out some
where in the building. It was only a flickering, creeping finger
of fire and smoke at first, but it slowly spread. An alarm was
sounded and from sleeping households emerged the Lewisburg
Volunteer Firemen. These civic minded citizens serve the best
interests of both their community and their fellow men by turn
ing out any time of night or day to aid in quelling fires, and as-
sisting in time of disasters. Activities such as these always
have been in the American tradition—doing one’s best for those
who need help.

A small group of sympathetic on-lookers gathered as the
fire gained headway and flames licked out the windows The
spectators, mostly youngsters, and men who were attempting to
help the firemen, pressed closer to the building. Then an ex-
plosion rent the smoke-filled air and the peace of a Sunday
morning in May was broken by the crashing of glass, the sound
of falling bricks, and the dreadful thunder as a three story wall
crumbled into the street. Out of the wild confusion that fol-
lowed came the toll; two dead and twenty-one injured—yet all
of the victims were present out of a sincere and worthy desire

help.
- Have we a moral here? Have we a parallel to this com-
munity tragedy? If you care to think about it, there is a paral-
lel and a serious one, which must be faced with strength and
fortitude. ;

In Europe the inferno-like fires of war are blazing. We
cannot watch our fellow men, thus engaged, with indifference
and lassitude. A large portion of the youth in American col-
leges and universities are against any volunteer-firemen work
away from our own shores. Other groups violently assert that
we must go abroad to stop it

There is a decision which must be made by each of us, as
individuals; made slowly and with deliberation, But like the
gallant, sincere men who tried to help their neighbors at the fire
here in town, we must not wait until the entire structure ex-
plodes and our walls of state tumble down.

A fire wall kept the Lewisburg fire from spreading to the
rest of town; our national defense program aims at a similar
goal as regards the foreign situation. There is no time to get
emotional, more than ever we must remain logically minded.
We must think for ourselves, and when our minds are made up,
abide by our convictions.

Picture On Campus

Psychologists Work on Film
| Concerning Hypnosis and
‘Color-Blindness’

| by John Bush

| The Bucknell campus was recently
the seene of the filming of a motion
tieceure relating to “color-blindness”
and the creation of this condition by
the use of suggestion in hypnosis.

The movie, first of its kind ever
produced on any college campus, is
entitled “Hypnotic Induction of Color
Vision Anomolies” and has been re-
leased by the Psychological Cinema
Register to universities and colleges
| concerned with instruction in this
thase of psychological experimenta-
tion.

Work of producing the movie was
1 in charge of L. Francis Lybarger, di-
‘rector of admissions and alumni sec-
| retary at Bucknell Dr. Milton H.
Frickson, noted psychiatrist from the
Eloise Hospital in Michigan, and Dr.
' Philip L. Harriman, professor of psy
| chology at Bucknell, originated the
{idea for the film. They also created
|the ‘‘set and arranged f the

hooting” of the scenes and action

The entire 500-foot film is colored

order to distinguish the chromatic
| colors, such as reds, greens, ete. from
the achromatic colors, including blae'
| and white

Dr. Erickson and Dr. Harriman are

een in the movie which has as its

ther main characters, LeAnne Boyle
0 Bucknell student from Freeland.
and Gladferd Machamer, Bucknell
| craduate and a resident of Lewis-
turg.

The action for the film was entire

unrehearsed. Dr. Harriman per

formed the hypnosis, and Dr. Erick-
{ron tested Miss Boyle for red-green
| blindness.

While in the state of complete am
j}nesia, Misa Boyle had been told she
would forget everything imparted to
her by the operator, but the film dem-
onstrates that the
color-blindneas presented by Dr. Har-
rman carried over when Miss Boyle
awakened and attempted to solve the
| teat of worsteds as administered by
Dr. Erickson.

The subject confused grays with
zreens, grays with blues, and browns
with reds. It is supposed that red-
green blindness caused by some
deficiency in the retina, but the Buck

{nell movie presents evidence that
uch a condition may be brought

Fd. note: This is a portion of a letter '
sent to President Marts and it's

| contents are pertinent to the stu-
dent body here at Bucknell. We
publish it in the hope that every |
student wilt heed it’s message. |
To University and College Presidents:

I wish to say an additional word |
to your students. This has to do;
with the tendency of students to en
rull in short defense training courses
instead of completing their regular
ollege curricula. The defense train-
ing program operates under the jur-
isdiction of this office I therefore
have a keen interest in the effective- |
res of the program. It should be}
| raid, however, that the demand of in-
| dustry for fully trained professiona!
— in all flelds related to na
tional defense is already greater than
|the supply and the need for these |
fully trained men is going to be
greater with the passing years.

It would be a mistake
for a student who is competent to
complete a full college course which

related closely to defense to drop
out of that course and complete some
short course in order to engage in in-
dustrial employmen at lesa than a
full professional level. The first ob-
ligation of college students is to fit
themselves for the highest type of
service; they should not give up the
chance to prepare for their unique
service in order to render a service
en a level which can be rendered by
a much larger number of men and

B.U. Band Plays
For Faculty Dance

Bucknellians Complete
Engagements for Year;
Whitcomb Leads Band

When the “Bucknellians”, eampus
ance band led by Howard Whitcomb,
“44, played for the faculty dance on
‘Tuesday night at Tustin Gymnasium,
it concluded a year’s work of thirteen
engagements, of which the two at
Penn State fraternity dances were
the most successful.

Featuring mostly trumpet and
trombone, the “Bucknellians” pattern
their music after the colored style of
Chartie Barnett. Through acquaint-

ance with Barnett’s arrranger, Bud |

‘Estes, leader Whitcomb secured a
dozen arrangements which the band
uses for fashioning ite own distine

tive rhythms. With those by Estes, |

arrangements by Simond, Bill For:
man, Wald Smith, and Whitcomb, too,
total about forty, making up the

_ band’s special repertoire.

The band strugglled against two
obstacies this year One was that
players seemed to lack a professiona!
attitude, and the other, that students
were prone not to acknowledge that
the “Bucknellians”, who are a semi-
professiona] group, could offer music
comparable to that of other bands
which have appeared on campus
Members fee! nonetheless that they
improved over performances of last
year.

Furthermore, they are proud that
audiences at Penn State, where very
many musicians play currently, de
clare the “Bucknellians” to be at
Jeast an averagely good dance unit
aThe players hope that next fall cam
pus prejudices will disappear.

If plans for next year materialize,
the “Bucknellians” may occasionally

NEED GOOD LEGS IN ARMY
Minneapolis, Minn.—(ACP)—She
on Beise, physical education instruc
tor, believes army life would caus
“pronounced physical hardship” for
90 percent of the University of Min
esota men of draft age.

Examining results of the unive
ity’s program to give prospective
craftees bady building routines, Beise
aid that “poor physical condition”
would make the transition from cam.
pus to camp difficult.

“They are weakest in’ the legs”,
| heise observed, “and legs are what
| they will have to use the most.”

Tents of prospective draftees show-
ed that they averaged 75 seconds for
the 440-yard dash, about 26 seconds
tlower than the time of trained track-
men. One youth took 245 seconds,

BATTING STATISTICS |

Although the Bison nine got off to
slow start, the past three games
have pre en that with good batting
und fielding, we can wir games also.
Although there are only really
three hitters batting above the .800
mark, many of the players hitting
less have come through with timely
hits that have driven home runs. |
With only seven more games re-

linaining on the varsity schedule, the

players have averages that demon-
strate their batting power. Leading
the field is Phil Stamm, pitcher —
outfielder, who has the healthy aver-
age of .5679. Bob Keegan is second
with .457. Third is Iarecci, who has
crly been to bat eight times, and has
a mark of .375.

In the base hits department, Kee-
gan has four homers, three doubles
and one triple, Cook and Ronk have
(hree doubles apiece, and Ronk also
has one home run to his credit.

dash, Fritechman eased their stride

With a two-run lead, the Bisons
faced their greatest difficulty of ths
game in the fatal sixth. Bill Sinton
reached first after being “poked” by
Stamm and went to third on Dave
Griffith’s double. Johnny Compardo’s
one-base clout contributed two runs
for Moravian with Sinton and Grif-
fiths handling the honors.

The Greyhounds placed two more
men in scoring positions in that inn-
ing. Stamm’s strikeouts staved off a
possible defeat and when the rains
really came the tilt rested at a stale-
mate, 4-4,

Notes on the Game

Tom Walker, playing the initial-
bag for the first time this campaign,
handled four chances without a single
miscue. He went down in the dirt
after one of Iarocci’s throws from
third and exhibited a 7 a. m. stretch
to etop a toss from Keegan in the
third inning.

The sporting pages of the big
newspapers go on their merry way,
telling In one column what happened,

think about what happened. A
charming oxample of this was the
Overlin-Soose taffy-pull in Madison
Square Garden last Friday. Happily
cr not, we didn’t listen to it over the

judges, in their own mysterious way,
gave the decision to Soose. The

All sorts of queer things happened
that evening. The price on Soose
suddenly jumped sky-high a few
fhhours before the fight Overlin’s
manager went to the judges and de-
manded fairness. Jaime Powers of
the New York Daily News said that

by Morty Silberman

Well, it looks like thie is the wind-up of the 1940-1941 Sports season for
Bucknell._.It’s been m mediocre yenr as far ae won and lost records go...
We've had lots better years, and also lots leaner ones Beat team perform
ance was turned in by the thus-far undefeated golf team, while individual
laurels go to Mel Knupp, Johnny Plewak, and “Mouse” Bessel on the grid
fron; George Haines, Ed Glass, and Bob Nolan on the basketball court; Frank
Garro and Marv Gerla in the ring; Bob Morrisson and Dick Kauffman on the
soceer field, Bob Keegan and Phil Stamm on the baseball diamond; Bob Rink
and Johnny Cronk on the tennis courts, Ray Armor and Bob Shaffer on the
cinder paths, and Bill Johnson and Bill Ramage on the golf links Out
standing event of the sports year was the signing up of Joe Buzas by th
New York Yankees.

In a bit of retrospect now lets take a ‘quick look at the performance
each of the Bison teams uf this past year, and see what the prospects are for
the coming year here goa

are the boys Coach Humphreys is going to have to get along wi t next
year: Bessel, Plewak, Priore, Reed, McElhan McGlincy, Haye Duege
Eyster and Serrao.......Prospects for a good campaign next year depend mair
ly upon two thing (1) that Mel Knupp, ground-gaining back id Fred
Kern, hefty tackle, are not taken inthe draft, and (2) whether Al Hu rey
can develop a center and two guards to plug up the middle of his line left va

to be the most successful of Bison teams of the year. At the present tin
they possess a record of nine wine as against but tw sse Most cons

team and an ali-win season, Delaware and Cornell, the latter being the cru-
cial test. Pacing this fine squad have been the two Bills, Johnson and Ra-
mage. Right behind these two aces come five more fine shooters, Johnny
Britton, Wilbur Bloete, Ross Jackman, Herm Fritz, and Bud Vanderbilt. The
prospects for next year are only fair, as the cap and gown will take from the

swallow, losing out on this prized award in such a manner after they had led
the field for the entire year, but the Kappa Sigs, who put up a great showing
in the last three sports of the year, basketball, volleyball, and baseball, must
have found their success sweet revenge for the manner in which they lost out
on the all-year trophy last year. However, the Sigs with a great freshman
class coming up should make things very interesting in the intramural ranks

for the next three years.

"| President Marts Discusses Deferment

Because out of 892 a earei the men at Bucknell, 240 are registered
in the draft and 113 will be eligible in June, “The Bucknellian” prints
this message from President Marts to the student body His re-
marks as to remaining in school to get every semester of education
are extremely important

Ed. Note:

tee of which Dean Page is chairman, to consider and endorse all application
for deferment which appear to fall within the intent of this new communica
tion, Local draft boards have been notified by national headquarters to give

due attention to such endorsements from Bucknell and other colleges.
I am enclosing a memo which gives details as to how you should proceed.
if you desire to apply for occupational deferment I am sending a copy t
; your parent (or guardian) so this new provision regarding some college men
and the draft may be completely understood. It is an extremely important
provision—important to the nation and to the individual—and I trust i

We are in one of the most dangerous periods in the history of our Repab
hic We must ali do our utmost in service to the nation, where each of us
can serve best. Our government at Washington is making the plans and this
new communication indicates that they feel the need for the service of many
college men in industry and certain professions
I hope each Bucknell man will continue to get every semester of educa
} tion here he poasibly can, until he is drafted, and that then each of us will
give his utmost in whatever form of service the nation decides to summoi
{ him.
