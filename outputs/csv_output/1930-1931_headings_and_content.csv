PERMITS,Rumors to the effect that permits for automobiles would have to be .se- cured from Harrisburg were di.scredit- ef' today when Dean R.

"""Xo","student will be allowed to drive a car unless he has secured a Bucknell license."" Discoveries of tremendous import- ance to the .scientific world have been mH<le during the past"
summer,by Dr. William
IL,"Eyster, professor of botany and genetics at Bucknell. Professor Eyster admitted that fact yesterday"
when,a Bucknellian reporter located him
among,tiu wav- ing com.st:ilks in his experimental field northwest of the Engineering Building.
He,has cultivated the field in conjunction with his .stu<iies in p^enetics and after eight years cross- breeding and in-breeding different strains or characteristics he is able to point out to scieme just where in the
chromosome--,the micro.scopic lie- tirminer of heredity-- the ultra-micro- scopic genes are which produce a given chiiracteristic.
"""No","one has yet reported this .d<<- covery,"" said Dr. Eyster."
He,"pointed out that the new findings were of ex- ceptional importance ^""efaunp they nre applicable throughout the whole field of genetics. Their influence on plant and animnl raising can not be e.sti- ' mated."
As,"the interviewer walked through the field with Professor Eyster he ' I saw an amazing variety of corn. In some plants the leaves .shoot up par- '. illel to the stalk. In others they ex- tendi outward. .Some leaves are thin and narrow; others, broad, thick, and leathery. In size they range from dwarfs to giants."
One,"whole row is devoted to the development of a pmctical agricul tural plant. Here stands a line o{ broadleav(Ml, healthy stalks, mo.st of them bearing two plump ear.s. Thi^ strain, developed from a small inbred plant and a normal plant, can stand against the forces of extended drought."

The,staff positions on the Bel'e
Hop,are
won,"entirely by competition liur- ing four years, and tho.se"
members,"not eligible for posts are pre.sented with keys, if their work throughout the year merits rewird. Staff posi- tions are awarded to the upper cla.ss- nien, with the"
men,of the lower classes taking a place in the different <lepart- ments until they step up to a position.

The faculty committee i.< to work with him in forming a more in imate relationship between students and profes.sors. This fact Dean Miller thinks is very important. Profes.sors do not always understand students and the students do not always under- stand professors. The freshmen committee is to be compo.sed of 20 or 25 outstanding"
members,"of the class is to be the head of a group of 10 or 12 fre,s,hmen."

way,"Dean .Vliller ho|)es to show the cla.ss that the group is responsible for the actions of the individual and that the individual is responsible for the showing of the cla.ss.

--,Yolanda K. Frank. '2^. Psychologically Writing To
The,Editor:
On,"Wediie.sday last, when a fresh-"
man,cea.sed to be an independent in- dividual and became a commodity for the
humor,"of the more dignified class- men, it occurred to"
me,that irony played more of a part than on pre- vious occasions of this reversion to the primitive. It is lamentable enough that young men and
women,
who,have
come,"to college in an efl'ort to submerge that high .school complex, should meet cus- toms that are reminiscent. But that the.se same jiien an<l"
women,"should be made the victims of a psychological ""faux pas"" is an error that should bt rectified, in order that the powers that l>e"
may,at lea.st seem consistent. I speak of the fussing rule which I was imposed upon freshmen follow- j I ing a gala week in which fussing was i j encourage<i to the extent that the
men,", land"
women,"dined, danced, and enjoy-' ; e<l themselves together without re- I .<!erve."
Why,were these people brought i together during Freshman
Week,if | I not to become acquainted with one ' another?
And,"if that was the pur- pose,"
why,"are they barre<l from con- I tinuing those acquaintances now?! These measures .serve cross purposes, and one defeats the other."
Why,"not be consistent ? j Neither should the fact be neglected j that the.se young people need social contacts with the opposite sex just as do other college clas.ses. It is too late to deny them these contacts, for they have already become .sex-con- scious. Doesn't this warrent a fare- well to anti-fussing? *An Abolitionist."

FRESHMAN,
POLL,"Simulating the Literary Digest, Culliver wa.sted the whole of Fresh-"
man,
Week,"in the throes of a .straw I vote. Feeling that things in general j are always open to improvement, he spent several hours in the arm.s of I Morpheus and was rewarded with a glittering dream of the"
Freshman,
Week,"ideal. Awakening enthu.>iastic, he plunged forth with a be'v\'ildering ballot. Every Freshman was privately approached at the end of each day of Freshnutn"
Week,"and asked what, in the light of his experience, he would have liked best on that day. The results were surprising enough and are here pub- lished in the hope that the proper authorities will notice them."

The,senior
who,signs himself
"""An","Abolitionist"" has pointed out another phase of the question which has come in for little consideration thus far. It is true that freshman"
men,ami
women,were brought together as
much,"a.s po.ssjble during Freshman Week, and that"
now,the new
men,
may,not date the

From,"an in.stitution as laige as Bucknell, you"

my,expectations. It is .so well-written in its every fea- I ture and its
humor,is .so laugh-pro- vcking that I
made,"a friend of it right away! It is al.so full of ideals, | as can easily be discerned from the j Platform. { .Such a paper has"
much,"more free- dom,"
much,"more power, and"
much,
more,"courage than a high .school paper of a similar ty|H' and size, fori at the high .school"
we,"would have been sorely and .severely reprimanded for the publication of anything at all against the .school system and its au- thority. But I was more pleased with ' than surprised at your platform. You | certainly have great possibilities; you' are cognizant of them, and you are making u.se of them. Perhaps you might be interested in the point of view of a frosh regard- j Ing freshman rules. Well here goes: I think that I have passed through ' the most puerile stages of"

my,"chlldhoo<l, to revert to and react the antics of"
my,"pre-.school days. I have not come here for a lot of hooey, a lot of tinpanny fanfare, and to be ibo.^sed about by a crowd of wild, hectic hoodlums."
My,purpose is and has got to be serious.
And,all of this unnecessary soph silliness does rot aid or add one iota to
my,"a<lvance- ment,"
my,"progress in the great un- explored expanses of knowledge. For some reason or other, the col- lege seems to be prejudiced against a freshie's having a little bit of conceit. Well, from"

know,"fully well that it will not l)e the i sophs and the freshman rules, but the profs and the real pursuance of knowledge and intellectual training that will deflate the expanded chests of us yiping youngsters, and only too emphatically <lisplay to us how little"

may,"enjoy great wealth."" Dr. Strayer's address in part fol- lows:"
An,"applicant for ailmis.sion to one of our Eastern colleges, let us say Bucknell L'nivur.sity, a boy sixteen years of age, gave as his reason for <<lesiring to enter the college the f-act I that, in his judgment, the be.st"
men,of his community were graduates of the institution and that lie felt that the.se graduates were
men,"of indomit- able spirit. Using the boy's words, he .said: ""I wish to enter Bucknell University because the best"
men,in
my,"community are Bucknell graduat.'s ami becau.se of the indomitable spirit of Bucknell men."" I wonder whether any philosopher could have given a better reason for the choice of a college than did this sixteen-year-old boy? Surely prepa- ration for a worth while life can best be accomplished"
by,as.sociation with
men,"of high ideals. If an in.stitution is properly characterized in the life and work of its alumni as one that has turned out the best men, it is a splendid place for a young"
man,"to spemi the most important four years of his life. If going to college de- velops a spirit which will not admit of failure, the time devoted to a col- lege education has been mo.st profit- ably .spent. I"
know,that I express the ideals of this institution
when,I propose to all of you
who,are assembled today for the beginning of a new year's work that those re.sponsible for your work here desire for you that achievement which will lead inevitably to the plac- ing of you in your .several communi- ties
among,"the be.st in accomplish- ment, in character, in service, and in the attainment of all that makes for the"
common,"good. Your life here in classroom, library and laboratory and in associsition with your teachers and your fellows should open up to you the paths which lead to a life worth living. Whether or not you lead such a life will ibe determined by the choices which you yourself make."
A,higher type of service requires that
we,have respect for the truth ami that
we,recognize that in the world in which
we,"live truth is dy- namic, changing, and developing, rather than static and complete."
Our*,"is an obligatiotT not pritiiarily to in- doctrinate others with our j)oint of view, but to help them insofar as"
we,can to think for them.seves in onler that they
may,get the joy and .satis- faction which cotnes from this type j of experience.
We,who have had the opportunity of education must Ix- our- selves free from prejudice and from hypacricy.
Our,greatest joy and sat- isfaction in working with our fellows should be in the discovery
among,"them of novel iileas, of points of view which are diflferent from those which"
may,have prevailed.
We,"shall not serve others, nor live the mo.st worth while life ourselves, except as"
we,are devoted to the truth and have faith j that the truth will
make,us free. I But it is not enough that we un<ler- stand our fellows and that we strive to have the truth prevail.
We,mu.st b<> willing to work with others for the
common,good.
A,"life devoted to a .search for truth mJiy conceivably be a very selfish one. It is only as one works in hearty cooperation with his fellows,"
now,"as a leader and then aa a follower, that he"
may,hope to con- triute in tmy significant fashion to the
common,gootl.
The,
men,of high ideals in every community mu.st attack the economic problems which confront our
modem,society.
We,cannot rest satisfied with a situation in which large groups of
men,are unemployed becau.se of waves of pro.sperity and depression in business.
We,cannot continue to tolertite a situation in which hone.st and indu.strious
men,and
women,find themselves herded into poorhou.seg during their old age.
We,need to examine and to recon.struct the eco- nomic situation which exploits the majority of the
members,of the com- munity in order that a few
may,en- joy great wealth.

Up,"after having gone to the trouble of dying, and finds that he is no longer appreciated, so he sets out to adventui-e. The au- thor, Douglas Durkin, philo.sophizes humorously through these adven- tures and turns out a book that can be read without digging. Seed, by contrast, is deep and lengthy, but vigorous. In it Charles Norris makes a thorough-going picture of birth and its control. His novel laments the contingency of large families. R. S. S. Margaret Fuller, that aixlent champ- ion of woman's emancipation from fos.sil customs, has a most compre- hensive biography by .Margaret Bell. Simply, but critically told, this life story is interesting read- ing. It is one of the best Paper B<K)ks. Doctor Serocold was a"
warm,weather publication from Kngland about Englishmen in the suburban dl.-?- tricts. Helen Ashton makes it thoroughly uni(|ue by telling of an absorbing 24 hours in an old doc- tor's life.

Sam,"Stern, '32, and Secretary,"

We,can hardly expect to repeat the record of last year's team.
W,iiat
we,"do need is some .support from the i-tudent boily."" Bucknell football prospects aren't f!(> bad. Coach Snavely is not prone to makintf rash predictions concern- ing: the cominjr season, yet he is con- fident, ami has confiilence in his men. Havinjr lost an entire varsity line. the coaching .staff hiis had its anxious"
moments,"conceminjr the outlook this fall. Thin(?s arc shaping up after three weeks of drilling, and while it would be too"
much,"to expect an un- defeated season or a record to com- pare with that of la!<<t year's jfreat irachine, yet Bucknell"
may,be assured of a creditable .season. Strong P'orward Wall Line coaches
Max,Reed and Carl Truxel have been working to develop
A,strong forward wall. Present in- dications point to anoiiier powerful Bison line. With
"""Andy""","Lobel and Merle Stonebreaker at the wings. ""Cy"" Marter and ""Steve"" Trudnak at the tackles, ""Ijou"" Mutzel and Clyde Miller at guard, ami ""Tex"" Coo.lwin at center, Line Coach"
Mar,Reed has a forward barrier weighing 1S!>> pound.s. Rpsen'es of ability are ready to enter the lineup at a moment's notice.
A,fine quartet of ends
"""Tom""",
Cum-,"mings. ""Beaver"" Williams, ""Bill"" Gos.se ami ""Ken"" Miller, is getting better every day, and should see a lot of action. Cummings, Gosse ami Mil- ler are big rangy boys. All lack experience, but they nnike up for this in speed and fight. ""Beaver"" Williams Speedy ""Beaver"" Williams has the makings of a great end. His greatest as.set is that of speed, for he can outsprint anycKiy on the .squad at 100 yards. Williams Is short and .st(K:ky, but packs IhO pounds of bone and muscle. At present his main weakness has been in blocking, but once that has been ironed out, the Bisons will have a good"
man,"to replace the regular ends in case of injury. ""Joe"" Crowe, .switchp<l from tackle to center, is putting up a irreat fight to displace Goodwin at center. Buck- nell has been well fortified at center for several years, with ""Ted"" Mit- (Cnntinuc'l o"" }'""il'i- T I The first buzz from the Frankford Yellowjackets"
camp,"has floated into town ami it's good and bad news. The bad news is that Coach Wally Diehl, '2K, is the only disabled player on the Jacket scjuad. Diehl was hurt in scrimmage"
durmg,the past week and ha.s had to stay out of the lineup for a few days.
To,"offset this alumni setback comes the word that .Manager Haines ami Shep Uoyle, the president of the Frankfonl .Athletic Association, are highly pleased with the work of K<ldie Halicki, star back and captain of the Bucknell 1928-'29 team.

Instead, the secret sessions are to be held merely to pre- vent possible interruptions on the part of spectators. Last year at times the spectators diverted the at- tention of the players.

Howard,"Harpstcr, Geneva mentor ar\d former Carnegie Tech star, regards Bucknell as only one item in a hard sche<lule which he meets with a team worthy of its spurs. With a veteran backfield, and a Wealth of oth>>r material from which to mould a good team, he has become the first potential .stumbling block in the long line of difficulties which will confront the Thundering Herd this season. Three veterans, Ca|>tain ""Johnny"" Knapik. Joe Preece, and Karl Ewing. will form a nucleus for the Geneva backfield. Alyman, an Ohio State transfer, will probably be quarter- back. Besides the.se men, Harpster i."". said to have adequate reserve strength. Line po.sitions are equally- well filled with experienced"

men,"will be ^iven October 27, it wa.s an- nounceii here tmlay by John Plant, director of the men's Physical Educa- tion Department. The tests will not be given until the"
men,"have com- pleted six weeks more work in phy.<?- ical education. If the tests are pas.sed to the satis- faction of Director Plant, and Fresh-"
man,"Coach Malcolm Musser, the soph- omore.s will be excuse<l from further athletic work with full credit. Thi.s"
move,has been
made,necessary by the inadequacy of the pre.sent equipment.
The,coaches have found it impossible to gnve worth-while
gym,courses under the prevailing conditions. Mr. Plant contended that the
new,eystem will not defeat the depart- ment's purpose of developing the un- derclassmen as
much,"as possible phys- ically, since it eliminates only tho.se"
who,"have alre.idy received adequate training. With the resulting greater freedom, Directors Plant and Mus.ser will be able to center their attention on the still very large group of underde- *veloped sophomores and the freshmen. Candidates will have to pass a thoroughly rounded test .series. This series includes work with posture, bar vaulting, running broad and run- ning high jumping, push ups, pull ups, medicine ball throwing, running of the 440 yard dash, tumbling, exer- cises on the bars and the horses, the 100 yard dash, the shotput, throw- ing and punting the football, ba.seball throwing, boxing, rope climbing, and general sports intelligence.

men,on the sijuad as there are

men,"coming out every day. The mo.st re- cent arrivals have not been .^ingled out as yet, but"
many,"of them are showing .some real football ability. Coach ""Mai"" Musser says, ""The boys .>ieem to have real spirit, but nothing <lefinite concerning"
the,"strength of the team can be deter- mined for at least .six weeks."""
From,ob.s<rvation of the work whicii the boy.- have been doing with the varsity it is apparent that Coach Mus.ser is very modest as to his team's pros- pects. There aie some very promising
men,"from some of last year's best high .school teams. Williamsport, Sunbury, Harrisburg, Steelton, and York are all represented on the Baby Bison squad. The .squad as it shapes"

Plan,
Innovations;,
Frosh,
Promising,
The,plans of Directors Grace Jen- kins and Ralph Hartz for the coming year in the men's and women's glee clubs are extensive and include sev- eral innovations. The
new,"freshman material which has been trying out for positions in the clubs has proved (luite ade<|uate for following the plans closely. The men's club held their fir.st meet- ing on Thursday evening in Bucknell Hall, and work on an entirely"
new,program for the .season was begun. Director Hartz
was,engaged this sum-
mer,in taking several courses in music in order to widen his field of activity.
As,a result he has arranged a pro-
gram,of exceptional numbers. Vacant positions are few because of the fine return of the older
men,"to the club, but any .student interested in cultivating his voice and touring for Bucknell"
may,try out with Direc- tor Hartz in his studio at the School of Music.
Two,"Exlennive Trips Extensive trips will \h' made at Thanksgiving an<l Easter, both of which will be extended to ten days. Formerly the Thanksgiving -trip has been only four or five days. The men's club will also enter the Inter- collegiate Song Contest, and in addi- tion there will be numerous short ex- cursions. The"
women,are also planning- to
make,a
number,"of short trips. This 'ii a fresh idea, as the women's glee (iub has never atteoipted overnight trips before. The great success for the past two seasons of the combined clubs has prompted a repetition of that activity. Plans for this have also grown in extent, and several pro- grams are promi.sed from this group this season."

Hy,"(iladyH Haatu', '32 John Goufrh wa.s one of the patron <<aint.s of the temperance"
movement,of the nineteenth century.
He,"was an EnKii.<<hman, who, cominK to America"
when,"he was a boy, .suffered jfreal hard.ship-s, took to drinkinjf, and ex- perienced the utter degradation of a drunken bum."
By,"hi.'^ own .sheer will, he draKKed him.self from the clutches of the Tijrer (.Alcohol) only to relap.se into it.s power twice again until he wa.s through with it."
He,became famou.s in the United States and England a.s u temperance lecturer. John
Gough,seemed to be one of those persons that have an in- ner loadstone that attracts other people to them.
He,"began with the idea that temperance was merely a moral movement, one apart from any religious influence. However, after his relap.se into the clutches of the Tiger, he realized that something more than ju.st moral force was nec- essary to keep a"
man,"from the power of alcohol. He became a stong sup- porter of the religious temperance movements, and also of the legal, the prohibition movement. -Although John"
Gough,"must have been an interesting character, he does not seem .so in this book -in spite of the obvious sympathy with which Honore"
Morrow,has treated her sub- ject.
He,does not appear in the pages of this book to be the
man,
who,by hi.<< very voice could
move,"thousand.s of people. Perhaps, it is because he possessed some Inner charm that can- not be painted by mere words."

G.,R. J'tewart during his stay on the campus resulted
when,"he attempt- ed to alight from the heights of a pullman on ""Tht- VVilliamsporter,"" Tuesday morning. At the luncheon given the inter- nationalist on our campus, an inevit- able train whistle burst in upon his words to the assemblage. His apt conjecture was that it had been blown by the same engineer"
who,"had halted ""The VVilliamsporter"" where no sta- tion platform existed. It 19. a bit ironical that a"
man,
who,"I has traveled the wastes of Russia and been intimate with the adventures at- tendant to that troublous country, should meet nnshap in the quiet sur- roundings of lewisburg. Urging all .students of instrumental music to take advantage of the ex- peiience offered"

Monday,evening at seven o'clock in the school of Music. Those interested .should report with their instruments. Former Director of the
Academy,"of Musi( of Heidelberg and conductor of major concerts in the internationally fiimous Bach-Reger Fe.stival, Profes- sor Gies offers a wealth of experience to his understudies of the orchestra.

Three ndnutes later it was all over and, while most of Phil .'iwett's co- horts were either safely across the line or well on their way, there re- maineil a little' knot of .sophomores vainly trying to present their dignity."
An,"interested throng from the ""Sem,"" the Hill, the town, .aid the various fraternity houses, watched the struggle from the safety of the side- lines, which were patrolled by"

"""Two","philosophies of life compete for the interest of every man,"" was the contention of Dr. George R. Stewart, noted internationalist, in a brief address in"
Commencement,"Hall Tuesday morning. ""Work,"" the internationalist main- tainbd,"
"""may",be employed squeezed dry of every personal profit; it
may,"be employed exerting every power. In it each can express the inner genius of his nature."" One view is that of the man, who, whether he is a college graduate or not, is uncultured and uneducated; the other, that of the genuinely educate<l. .Seven factors contribute to genuine *ducation, according to Dr. .Stewart. First of these is a respect for author- ity and tradition."
He,"sai<l, while ad- mitting respect for the incon.sequen- tial phases of tradition was foolish, that the great temptation to be a fad- list should be avoided, maintaining that truth once discoveretl is always truth. Loyalty To Technique"
A,"second factor he characterized as loyalty to the technique and dis- cipline of one's vocation. Whether doctor, or lawyer, scholar or arti.st, a iKirticular technique mu.st be learned, a peculiar discipline must be obeyed for true success. The eminent divine stated that the learning mind is the e.ssential of every calling. Though the journeyman has"
more,"skill than the apprentice, he must preserve the same receptiv,- mind if he is to maintain his position. Similarly, he intimated that one mu.st have continuous development of suppressing a democratic press, and stiffling individual enterprise,, the country is, as a whole, decidedly un- happy. The farmers, suspicious of the machine government with its fatal combination of firing .squad and trac- tor propaganda, are grudgingly sub- mitting to their fate.

Howard,Hirpstrr and his Geneva gridilers will come to Lewisburg primed to give the Bisons a severe te.st in the opener of Buck- nell's hard schedule. Geneva will be no set-up. This
game,will not be one of those tradi- tional soft spots.
Howard,"Harpster has moulded tojfether a strong team to ttst the metal of the Snavely ma- chine. Captain Johnny Knapic will lead the Geneva eleven into action. Knapic is one of the cleverest hacks in Westf-m Pennsylvania and will have to be watched closely. The rest of the Beaver Fails backfield will also be experienced.

The Bisons look fine on paper and the result of the Geneva fracas will g:ive Bucknell followers a good ]ine on the strenjrth of the team.

The,work of Hinkle will be watched with
much,"interest by Bucknellians. Last year Hinkle ran wild against all opposition. Here again the work of the line will be scrutinized, for the big fullback had a great forward wall in front of him last fall to open uj) the holes. If Bucknell fields its usual strong line again this year, Bucknell's hardrunning backs"

We've crushed the inter- Aociety antagonism that's hindered our (advancement in previous year.= to #t<<rt Jv year of unprecedent accom- pliBhiYient. ""We're trying to put student dra- matics at the hea<l of extra-curricular Activities."

we,have sub- ordinated everything in our efforts to have a successful .season that will /unilsh

The,"meeting was held for the purpo.^e of <liscussing plans for the National Student- Faculty Conference to be held in the Book-Cadillac Hotel . I at Detroit (luring the Chri.stmas re- cess, December 27-31. ' Professor Bond is one of a commit- tee of twenty"
men,and
women,from various sections of the country
who,have been at work for more than a year in laying the groundwork for the | Detroit Conference. Faculty-.student PSroap5 are at work at
many,"colleges, | including Bucknell, in making pre- j llmlnary ob.sei-vations regarding the! relations of college life and religion. ' The propo.serl area.s of conversation for this vacati(>>n time conference"
number,.seven an<l are as follows: (1)
The,.ulministiative policy; (2) The educational system; (3> The .social and organized groups of the campus; (4) Moral standards in a ilay of relativity; (5) Social attitudes and] responsibilities; {(\) Personal counsel- 1 ing and vocational guidance; (7)
The,"place of religion in higher e<liication. j Attentlance at the conference will not be restricted to college adminis- 1 trators and teachers alone, for stu- [ dent.** wiill'be privileged to attend and: present their viewpoints. Of the eight chemical engineers graduated from Bucknell last year, one of"
whom,"received his Master of Science degree, six have employment with well"
known,"concerns, one has not yet accepted an offer that was"
made,"him, and one is back in school working for his Ma.ster of .Science de- gree. All of the"
men,working had their jobs before
Commencement,and went to work .'Won after being grad- uated.
The,graduate student
who,"received hi.s Ma.<<ter of Science degree last year is Henry B. Stere, '29, who Is"
now,research chemical engineer for the Alumnium
Company,"of America. Mr. Stere's immediate superior is Kalph B. Derr, '17,"
who,"is head chem- ical engineer of the development de- partment. .\. Henry Reismeyer, '28, is also working with the same com- pany whose plant is located at"
New,"Kingston, just outside of Pittsburgh. Five Have Positions The five other new chemical engi- neers are: Donald N. Brown, attached to the chemical <level<)pment depart- ment of the Corning Glass"
Company,"at Corning,"

who,"sj)ent last year at Syracuse Univers- ity, is also back .studying for his"
M.,"S. <iegree. l>ast year two companies sent rep- resentatives to Bucknell to imiulr..' about senior chemists, and four com- panies have indicated to Dr. S. C. Og- burn Jr., head of the department of chemical engineering, that they will have"
men,here in the spring to inter- view the .seniors. These companies are: Uu Pont Co.; The Carnegie Steel Co.; The American Telegraph and Telephone Co.; and The Imperial Color Works. This year there is
a,ten percent in- crease in the enrollment in chemical engineering. This has been the aver- age increa.se for the past five years. About half of the freshmen in the chemical engineering cour.M* are from
New,"Jersey, two are from the"
New,"England States and the rest are local students. Three freshmen in the course arc brothers of graduates in the department of chemical engineer- ing at Bucknell. ""Literature is the la.sting expres- .sion of life in words,"" declared Pro- fessor James P. Whyte, Friday even- ing to a large audience in Bucknell Hall in the introductory lecture to the course in World Literature offered by the department of languages. ""Only in world literature,"" he con- tinued, is literature truly felt."" Quot- ing Tennyson, he said, '""We are the heirs of all the ages in the foremost files of time.' Con.sequently"
we,"are the heirs of all the literatures of all the ages."""

He,"pointeii out that life is the basis for all literature and that life it.self is everywhere essentially the same. Citing the Hellenic and Hebraic literatures as typical examples of the misuse of great treasures, he showed that in both ca.ses the wrong attitude? for their appreciation has been adopt- ed."
He,"contended that in the ca.se of the Greek and Latin classics a critical study of the mechanics of ver.se and of syntax has obscured the iwauty of the work.s, while with the Hebraic contributions, controversy and miscon- ception have clouded the great na- tional book from true appreciation."
"""What","we need,"" he concluded, ""is the evolutionary attitude towird lit- erature, not the judicial or the critical .ttitude."" Professor"

A,"thesi.s is recjuired by the department of all seniors before graduation. The .students must submit monthly reports as to the progress of the work or; their problems, and in addition have frequent conferences with the profes- .sor in charge. Problems assigned are either new ones or .some undeveloped pha.se;. of old ones.

The,
whole,"fabric of advertising rests on public confidence,"
which,
may,be likened to a vast natural resource to be conserved for the benefit of all ad- vertisers
and,not
abused,
and,destroyed by the few. the vandals of business. Public Confidence is
weakened,
by,all dishonest advertising.
While,the
law,is able to take care of the coarser
and,"cruder swindles, there arc de- vices far"
more,destructive
which,
can,be reached
and,restrained only
by,an enlightened public opinion
on,the part of advertisers
and,agents
who,
work,for them.
"However,",public opinion has
been,steadily crystallized
and,business i.s tending to get better in its observance of ethical distinctions because it
has,learned that in the long run it pays.
The,"millenium is not yet here, but gross breaches of"
good,faith are apt to react
on,"the advertiser responsible, as the opposition stirred"
by,the advertising tactics of the
American,
Tobacco,
Company,has
shown.,
No,practice should be followed
by,
one,agent
which,if followed
by,all
would,demoralize the practice of advertising
and,render it unprofitable to all
engaged,in it. Professional
men,
must,stand
by,one another to the extent of preserving their profession as a whole.
Doctors,"are competitors, but"
do,not acquire patients
by,
undermining,each other's methods.
The,"practice of advertising, like the practice of medi- cine,"
depends,largely
on,"faith, the faith of the patient in medicine, the faith of the"
manufacturer,in advertising.
When,"patients lose faith in doctors, medicine suffers,"
and,
when,"advertisers lose faith in agents, advertising sufiFers."
An,agent is
bound,to believe other agents capable
and,honest
and,see to it that they are.
by,cooperative establishment of tests
and,standards. If
we,cannot
have,collective faith in our collective efforts
we,"cannot procure the confidence of the individual advertiser in our individual efforts. After all. advertising, like medicine, is greater than its exponents"
and,practitioners.

^,Cancellation of the plans to dis- continue two trains on the Reading railroad on which
many,Bucknell students are dependent was announc- ed recently in a letter to Dean R.
H.,"Rivenburg from Victor B. Fisher, general superintendent. The trains which the Reading plan- ned to discontinue were the 8:47. northbound, and the 6:11, southbound. Several students would have been un- able to attend the university had the service been discontinued. The letter to the Dean from Mr. wisher follows. ""Your favor of the 18th instant re- lative to proposed change in our pas- senger (Service effective September 28th, 1930. has been the subject of very careful consideration and while our patronage on the trains in ques- tion has decreased to an alarming de- gree and our"

MaOe,Senior Council Fails to
Act,

Every,Fraternity
Becomes,"Involved as In a series of six meetings during inen'8 rushing season, the Senior Council discussed allege*! violations of the rushing rules by several fr;i- ternities, but failed to take any action to either punish the freshmen for breaking the rules or to censure th<<> fraternities involved."
As,"far as the Council is concerned, the rushing sea- son charges have been dropped. The niiitter was taken before the faculty, but nothing has been forth- coming from that move. The ques- tion of"
who,"to punish was so involve<l that even the faculty was able to offer no suggestions. Charges of breaking the rushing Tules were levelled against one fr\- temity at first, /)ut subsequent dis- cussion revealed that almost every fraternity in the university had vio- lated the retrulations in one res|)ect or another. The Council meetings were full of hidden threats and coun- ter-threats, and in such an atmos- phere, accoiding to one Council"
mem-,"ber, it was impossible to come to any just decsion. While campus opinion is divi<<led on the matter,"
many,"stuilent.s and facul- ty members are of the opinion that the rules this year proved more suc- cessful than in any previous year. 'The greatest weakness in the rushing rules this year."" .tiid"

Bucknell students and partisans of the Bis<<m ftsttball team will find"
much,"in it that is of interest, for this ar- ticle sets forth Coach Snavely 's basic principles for the development of foolb^ill plays."
--,I'he Editor. The basis of pood football is soundness.
A,sound offeni^e is based upon sound plays. Sound plays are based upon sound fundamentals; and >>40und fundamentals are assignments which the players can execute against <<)pponents
who,are their equal in >>'very respect. Ba.-*e your plays upon what you
know,your
men,"can do against .strong opponents. See that they do tho.se things, and don't ex- pect more. Freciuently, if not usually, the play which attracts the attention of the younger couch is not a play which i.>> strong in it.self. Often it is merely a check play, a variation of .some"
more,"basic play, and is designed to"
make,the defen.<e a little cautious. Often it
may,"be an inconsistent, ground gainer, but occasionally it"
may,produce a spectacular run if it catches the opponents deploying lo fttop the stnmger play which it re- sembles.
A,"collection of tricky maneuvers, such as thi.<, without their key plays, would look great if"
we,only could haMe the opp<ments ether- ixe<<l while
we,operate. But again.st wide-awake opposition
we,"usually will find that a successful offen.se, while it"
may,be embellished with a few bruin .-storms ju.st to show the folks how- smart
wf,"are, must be based upon Tjower plays which (an he woiked without the aid of iiiiraclos <>n the part of our players. I believe that a piay, to be classed as a strong play, mu.st pos.sess botli o' the following (|ualificati.ir.,;: First, the"
men who,execute it ipu.-t have more
--,con.iiderably more
--,than an <<-vpn chance to block every de- fensive player
who,"is in such a posi- tion that it might be possible for him to reach the bull carrier before th<<' lattfr cros.'ics the line of sciimniage. Second, after blocking the oppo- nents"
who,"are on the line of scrim- mage, the play mu.st provide at le ist <me interfei-er preceding thfc- ball car- rier to protect him from the defensive backfield men. IKyeplion Employed by all Coaches Dn-reption, for the purpo.^e of fa- cilitating blocking or in the hope of * lecoying opponents entirely out of position, is employed by all coache.^. Sometimes it is overdone, but when"
H,"can be secured without violating the principles of sound play, it is of v.hat if he doesn't charge?"
We,had a couple of the.se plays that
we,used one season until
we,"met a good guard, Sometimes he charged; sometimes he drifted along the line of scrimmage; and sometimes he stood still, holdinur off tlie offensive linemen with his hands, all of which was good football. He just wouldn't do what we wanted him to do, and as a re.sult these plays showed a net loss for the afternoon, I dropped them. Plays Depend on Defense's .\ction Of course, all plays depend in a measure upon the defense following some expected course of action. But in"
many,"cases, the defen.se has no alternative, or at least"
we,"can govern its behavior to .some extent. Vor example, if a defensivie tackle wen* to play four or five yards out beyond our end it would be entirely impos- sible to run outside of him. But i)y hitting inside him once or twice"
we,could quickly compel him to come in

The,"plan U&s not yet bet'n put to a vote by tlie entire .senior class, the group that has been picked to raise the fund.'.."
When,"the matter is voted ! upon,"
we,"feel confiilent that it will be defeated, for surely the m.ijority , of the class ha.s not forgotten that j Bucknell takes a.>"
much,pride in its j dignity and refinement as does any i university.
To,"adopt the famed | slogran of two yeitrs back, ""Is Buck nell a University or a Business Col- lege?"" Bucknell has been and continues to be"
known,for it.s high stamling
among,I educational institutions; it needs no ' garish sign mounted on one of !* s historic buildinifs.
The,sign idea | seems like some liigh-preswure sales- j man's dream come true.
A,better use for the
money,"of the class of 1931 would be a sizeable contribution to our library. That would be a i gift that would last for more year<< than any sign, a gift that would | further the purpose for which Buck- [ was established"
--,"the dissemina- , tion of truth."
The,one logical argument .set forth I in favor of the sign is that it would I be a means to distinguish the Uni- iversity from the proposed feder i I penitentiary.
On,that piece of rea- soning
we,"offer no comments. However, if the .seniors feel they must"
mar,"the Union county landscape by erecting the sign,"
we,have one small request to make. Cji\e the other institution .so near Ka.st College

Temple,"has been following :i policy of working out only once weekly under the lights in order that th.>> opposing team might have a fair chance. Bucknell has also in.stalled lights on her playing field In Memorial Stadium. The Bison.s have been practicing daily since the Albright game, ;ind have become somewhat ac- customed to playing undei- artificial light.*. Night Foot ball Popular N'ight football i.s popular in Phila- delphia, and Temple his been draw- ing a goo<i crowd in her opening"
games,with Thiel and .St. Thomas.
The,"cla.sh with Bucknell should jam the Temple stands because of the in- tense rivalry between the colleges. Last year Carl Truxel,"
who,is
now,"coaching the Bison ends, and Clark Hinkle starred in the \:i to Buck- , nell win."
The,
game,"was played on I treacherous footing, for rain soaked 1 the stadium throughout the game. Temple has niade additions to its coaching st iff since that day. Heinin | Miller still guides the Owls, but he j has adde<l capable assistants to his *taff. Bert Bell, former backfield coach at Pennsylvania, has been coaching Temple's backfield. Bell is the"
man,
who,inventeil the hidden ball plays whih maile P^nn famous on the plays which made Penn famous on tiu' his term as coach. Bell
playd,in the backfield for Penn under the same system that Heinie .Miller wa.- grounde<l in. Bell hns been teaching the Temple backs how to work the hidden l>all tricks. Temple has been thorough in de- veloping her backfield candidates for Bell has brought with him to the Owl practice .sessions Al Wa.scolonis
who,
was,"largely responsible for the .suc- cessful working of the hidden ball plays at Penn a few years back. Bell and Wascolonis have developed their system to a nicety at Temple and their plays are working to per- fection. La.st week against St. Thomas, Temple gained yard jifte* yard through their successful execu- tion."

many,faults of the Albright game. Bucknell will jhave full .strength on the fteld for it I is thought that Stonelireaker's injury ! in Saturday's fuss is not serious j enough to keep him out of the Temple jgame. Ciiptain Tony Slate should be ' ready to go full sHeed by next Friday nighl. His bad leg stomi up well un- der the .strain of the pla.\ again.st the Lions and he should be the Tony of old by Friday night. Both coaching staffs are anticipat- ing a hard
game,"and no stones are being left unturned in the efforts of the opposing camps to field their best po.ssible combinations at game time. Whether Temple will be able to work her hid(4en ball plays success- fully is a matter of conjecture, Thev vorkiMl against St. Thomas, but Buck- nell"
may,"b<' a <lifferent proposition. If the Bison line can he whipped into shape by next Friday night, fans"
may,look for a very close
game,"with the lesiiit a toss-up. This is F'ordham's eleventh straight win. The Fordhamites .seemed to have no trouble after the first quar- ter, although the recovery of fumbles and the interception of passes were directly responsible for the large , score. As"
Fordham,"has yet to go up against a team of her owi> caliber for | n teal test, the first two victories are , no reliable indication of her ability. I"

Romeyn,"H. Rivenburg announced in his office to- il ay. Rhodes left his rooming house on December 8, after his parents,"
who,"were visiting him, reprimanded him for excessive cutting of classts. De- vising a rope of be<Ming, the Blooms- burg boy climbed from a window and left. Companions, searching for him later, learne<l that he had cashed a check at Wainies. Following clues given by townspeople, his friends con- tinued to the Montandon station. Here they learne<l that Rhodes had purcha.sed a ticket to Philadelphia. Communication with Philadelphia authorities failed to find word of the missing student."
A,.search was car- rieil on by city and stat* police in both Pennsylvania and
New,"York, while radio stations and newspaper-^ joined in the hunt. Photographs and detailed descriptions were sent to the police in major centers. Samples of his handwriting were distributed to the officials of nearby communities. In January, his parents"
made,"a futile visit to Frackville, near"
Mahoney,"City, wherte he was repoi-ted to have been .seen."

W.,"Potter, '17, was men- tioned in"
The,"Williamsport Sun of October S, for havinp served eleven years as supervising principal of the"
Montgomery,"borough schools, as an educational leader, and as an active citizen and church worker."
The,out- atamiini? achievement of his years of
work,in Montgomery was the impetus
he,gave to the
movement,"which re- , suited in the buildinff of the"
new,| school which is
now,the pride of the borough. Mr. Potter was graduated from Bucknell Inixersity in 1917 with highest honors.
He,"became principal ^ of a Westmoreland county high school after graduation, and later was"
made,superintendent of the Mount Plea.-^ant school-. For some time after this ;
he,"worked with the government, tak- ing up vocational work with the"

Buckets of blood, senile fruits, and :i conglomerati' mass of decayed mat- ters weiv cast without the least lii.-j- crimination for age or beauty upon the writhing bodies of -iome o3d, very odd, hundred neophytes. This is, no doubt, Dickinson's con- ception of a class .scrap; it looks more like the freshmen received the .scrap, in.stead of engaging in it. The *line of demarcation separating the hordes 'of frosh and sophs was a rojie stretch- |ed between the field gates."
Time,"and again the first year gentlemen hurled themselves upon the stout hearted brutes of the .second class, only to be repulsed under a shower of refuse. 'The novel i<iea of stretching the rope coupled with the characteristic ba.-<h- fulness and retiring nature of so"
many,"frosh cau.sed them to suffer far more than was necessary from nasal exhau.sti(m and stench. It is reported that the newly installed shower rooms stood up bravely under alistio and shut the beer spigot. It's all off, so beer self. But, aa we of the intelligentsia well know, ""every cloud has a silver lining."" It i.i rumored that"

Long,"forced to air his wit in the privacy of his home, always hounded by that evil"
maxim,hurled at him by disgruntled enemies
--,"""The pun is the lowe.st form of"
"wit""--",the punster has led a hard life these
many,"years. Now, however, the day has dawned for his emancipation, and we gladly join in the"
movement,"to introduce his brain-child, the pun, into the best circles. Undoubtedly,"
we,"argue, a pun of the best grade cannot be formulated on a moment'.^ notice."
On,"the con- trary, it must be mulled over mental- ly"
many,"times before it attains tho right flavor. Then, its spon.-or must await an auspicious"
moment,before he hurls it at his unsuspecting victims.
A,pun of this type is truly a work of art and is used by
many,"of the na- tion's well-known figures. This pun's little brother, the com-"
mon,"pun, is ju.st as potent an in- fluence in the country's humor. Any- one can produce a common, ordinary pun but just becau.se it is the proper- ty of the butcher, baker, and candle- stick maker is no reason"
why,"this pun should be looked down upon. The.se two types of pun reach more people and cause more laughter, of- ten genuine, often feigne<l, but never- theless laughter than any other kind of humor. This, alone, is an over- whelming vote in favor of the pun. The confirmed pun.ster, in contrast to other humorists, is privileged to h.ugh at his"
own,"wit. Y'our other humorists are reciuired by convention . , .. ,, ., , ,,,, ,,,.,,,,,,_, to present severe countenances while mo.st inevitable that all present . ' ,, , ,"

Some,humorists of the other school often fail to do this.

D<<an,J. Hillis Miller spoke on the
modem,trends in religion at vesper services at the
Women's,College Sun- day. His purpose
was,"to stimulate thought in the direction of religion. ""To get college people to think about religion and to get anywhere in their thinking a most difficult an<l discour- aging task."" he .said."
He,"critized the article that appear- ed in the ('hristian Century on Oc- tober l.'S, which was a parable of tho ""Safe and .Sage."" It was written in connection with the opening of Dr. '"
Emerson,Fosdick's church in
New,"I York. ! Christianity, according to the edi- ' tor, is on the defensive. Dr. Fosdick is building his church at the foun- tain head of .scepticisni. It is situ- ated very near Columbia University in which"
many,courses are taught *which encourage scepticism.
New,
York,"itself is one of the most irre- i ligious cities, and furthermore, the ' church is being erected by John D. Rockefeller Jr., which makes it rep- ( resent capitalism. The editor con- tends that education, imiifference, and j"
e^sT,
COLLEGE,

from,an exterior view.
Nothing,has been slighted that

was,the forerunner of several local

whereby,the

game,should be a good one. lUicknell'.s frosh eleven have hit a fast pace so far thi.s cam- paign and are anxious to annex thi
game,"on Friday. It i.><< hoped that, by then, ail tho cripples will be back in shape and that the team will be able to .start *with its full .strength. Kddie Meyers' knee is expected to be in shape and Demp.sey,"
who,"has been out with an injure<i hand, will be in the lineup again. It is not known whether Fox will be *able to play or not a.s his injury ir the Bellefonte"
game,was of a rather serious nature. ' Th** pleai<ure of seeing a night
game,"at the Bucknell stadium is de- ferred by this change in plans. Both varsity and frosh teams have been practicing under the lights, and the plan was to initiate night football here with this game."

member,of the Inter-collegiate Soc- I cer Association. I'enn State
won,"the title last year and has alwuys put good teams on the field. I The Bucknell team has shown ! steady improvement in practice, and shf)uld be in good shape for the en- counter with the Nittany Lions. There have been"
few,"serious injuries on the Bison S(|Ui<l during the past ' week, while some of those hurt earlier in the season are on hand again. Fleming is Back .Alex Fleming, veteran halfback,"
who,
was,"out with a twisted knee is in shape again, and has been work- ' ing out with the .squad the pa.st few days. Captain I'ederson's h g injurs ' is also resp<m<ling to treatment, and he will be in good shape by the end of the week :is well. The greatest improvement in thf team's play has been the work of the forwards, which was lather weak in I the Stroudsburg encounter. The fir.st team forwards have been scoring con- sistently in the .scrimmages this week and by the time of the State"
game,"should have hit a fist stride. Parsons and l.ongstreth at fullback have been showing great booting abil- ity ami defensive work of a highly satisfactory nature. Gl izier, at half- back, is also playing a heady, con- sistent game."

The,matter is of interest to Bucknellians Ix-cause of the great up- roar over the smoking problem here lost year. The following is taken from the Swarthmore I'hoenix: The rule of the Board of Manager which forbids
women,"to smoke was repealed recently at the November meeting of the Board. At the .same time the petition of the Women's Stu- rlent Crovernment .A.<<sociation for h smoking room on the campus was de- nied. The Board resolution is as fol- lows: ""For"
many,years the Society of Friends has dl.scouraged the use of tobacco. The Board of Managers of Swarthmore College believe in this view and wish in every
way,to uphold it. It has been the tradition of the Society that concerted opinion is often
more,"effective than definite rules. With this in mind the Board of .Man- agers urges the students at Swarth- more College to avoid the u.se of tobacco, but proposes to leave the de- cision to each individual. ""The Women's Student Government bas petitioneil the Board to abrogate the rule against smoking by women. Acting under the belief that by con- certed effort to discourage the use of tobacco greater progress can be"
made,"in that direction than in other ways, it is resolved that it i.s the sense of the Board of Managers of Swarth- more College that the Board ride against smoking by"
women,be re pealed and that the petition from
Women's,"Student Government be re- ferred to the Faculty and Adminis- ttative Officers of the College. 1 ""Be it further resolved that the re- <juest of the"
women,"students for the designation of a speciilc room for smoking be denied."""

game,".^aturd.iy to the Chicago Cards, 34-7. The"
game,was played in the tcieth of a gale which
made,"the going hard for both teams. Th"" Jackets' one touchdown was the r< -ult of a short pass tossed"
by,"""Eddie"" Halicki over the ji^oal to Lrnst. Kostos, '2(t\ Jones, '30, and Hali(ki, ""SH, played through tin- en tire came. The Bucknell team was defeated by Penn State 3-0 in a hard played"
game,.Saturday that was featured by th * offensive work of the State team and excellent goal tending by .Stern for Bucknell.
The,"Bisons, playing their .second"
game,"of the .season, were unable to cope successfully with the swift pass- I ing attack of the winners."
A,".stiff , northwest wind aided the .N'ittany hooters considerably in their assault I on the Bucknell goal. With the win<l behind them, th"" local team had the ball in State's t<< rritory almost the entire first quar- ter, but were unable to convert any s'hots into tallies. In the second quarter, .State took advantage of the wind and continually threatened to push through a .score. Their efforts were succe.ssful toward the last of the quarter and the half ended ]-(i. BiHons Take Off'ensive During the third quarter the Buck- nell team again took the aggressive, but were not able to keep Anderson, State center forward, from getting his second marker. The Bisons braced from this point until late in thv , fourth quarter, when Holmes scored again on a centered ball from Bat- j tersby, outside left. ' Bucknell rolled up 14 first downs to two for Gettysburg in Saturday'.^ great victory. Bucknell's backs I smasheil through the highly touted : Getty.sburg line at will. Three Bison bucks, Hinkle, Ross, and Mezza ac- counted for l.'>8 yards"

was,"woefully weak in her I overhead game, completing onl\ two pa.s.ses out of nine attempts. Get- tysburg completed three of six, for ' 00 yai-ds, the longe.st, of 45 yards, I coming in the la.st period."

made,"to have the noted Byrd explorer present hi.s lecture and motion pictures in the Lt wLsburg High School auditorium. Doctor Liould will rank with ftremo.st explorers of all times, and because of hi.s being next to"
Com-,"mander Byrd in the recent expedition, his .story of adventure will have spe cial appeal. Doctor Gould is a form- er profe.ssor of geology at the Uni- versity of Michigan. He had charge I of the geographical work of the Put '"
nam,expeditions to Greenland and U) BafTenland. Admiral Byrd
say,"si that Gould's geological work with his { expedition is one of the most notubl*: features of the entire exploration. Popular as Lecturer ""I^rry"" Gould, as he was"
known,"to the Byrd group, i.s a popular lec- turer, for he is a popular person young, adventurous, colorful, with a decided flair for expre.^sing his scien- tific observations in a frej*h and un- usual way. It is said that no one except Admiral Byrd himself coul<I give .such a comprehensive view o^ the rxpedition to the Antartic. Gould is a photographer as well is a geologist, explorer, and lecturer."

SKATING,"By Harold \. Robb, '31 Bucknell students have never been privileged to enjoy well-developed outdoor winter sports becau.se the University has not felt able to provide the necessary facilities for such recreation. Bucknell's environment pos- sesses possibilities for winter sports, however, and it ought to be possible lo develop the.se possibilities and enable Pucknell"
men,and
women,"to participate in these healthful winter activities. This article suggests that it would easily be possible to develop several difTei-ent outdoor winter sports, and provide tentative schemes for their development. Penn year. Critici.sm directed at Harvard in re- cent years for the mass of .substitutes that have entered football games with relatively small opponents"
may,yet be answered by the Crimson. In the Haj-vard Fre.shman-Exeter
game,each team was restricted lo the use of 25 players. The system
may,"l>e extended to varsity games. * * * * Carnegie students were treated to four outstanding si)eakers not long ago when Clarence Harrow, the noted criminal lawyer, told"
why,he is an agnostic; Rabbi Samuel
H.,"Goldis- man, of Pittsburgh, told"
why,"he is a Jew; Quin O'Brien, Chicago attorney, supported his position as a Catholic, and Dr. Albert E. Day, of Chri.^t"
M.,"E. Church, Pitt.sburgh, upheld his be- liefs as a Protestant."
The,"student body has enjoyed prac- tically no skating privileges.Proro^al have been made to enclose Ix)omis Field with embankments, and flood it lor .skating and hockey"
when,"freezing weather comes. The expense that would be involved in this scheme is a barrier to its realization, though wi- believe l.oomis Field would give lis :*, very good skating pond. The west side of the field is .slightly higher than the ea.st, necessitating consider- I able work and expen.se in building an 1"
embankment,to compen.sate for thr? \ difference. For the present it seems that plan will have to be laid aside liS a possibility for the more distant ' future. \ Plans for Skating I'ond La.st winter I'rofessor F. E. Burpee tried to
make,a skating pond by flooding a
meadow,"west of the sta- dium. Results weif encouraging, and the flooding of this meadow, which is on college property, is a promising possibility. The pond is on the right side of the road to the golf course, and is just beyond the stadium, ""the stream traversing this ground fur- nishes sufficient water for the pur- pose, and is enclosed by embankments or. three side*."
\,
dam,"built across the fourth side high enough to back up the water would be the only sig- nificant item of expense involved in the project, and the cost would be rela- tively little at that. .\"
dam,could be built so as to provide for an overflow \ and controls to regulate the watei supply
when,flooding became neces- sary.
A,"good -skating pond like thi<< would be excellent for hockey fori both girls and boys. | Thus far skiing has received little j I support as an accepted sport. Par- I ticipation In it has been very slight. , Several of our students have hevn seen skiing down the hill from"
Main,"College to Loomis Field, or from the Eiology Building towards the Sigma Chi hou.se and circling around to- wards the Chemi.stry Building. Never- theless, skiing offer.s good prospects for development."
Would,Provide Thrills The angle of the incline
down,the hill to Loomis Field is sufficient for small jumps which couhi be
made,"of wooden platforms set on the slope of the hill. If properly planned, these wouhl supply sufficient thrills for .mateur jumpers. The incline on the north side of the golf course is .steep I noiigh for beginners at the sport, as the contour Is fairly even and an ascent goes up on the opposite side to check speed without turning at the bottom. j Snow.shoeing is a dead issue, while tobogganing has scarcely received mention as a pos.sibility. In"
many,of the
New,"Englan<l states winter golf is the vogue, lied balls are used to contrast with the snow. The surface must be hard to prevent the ball frem being buried under- neath the snow and lost."
Snow,that has remained a long time and has be- come wind-beaten fills the require- ments. Bucknellians
may,not be en- thusiastic enough about golf to be in- tere.sted in its winter possibilities. Suggests Snow shoe Parties Students and faculty in colleges in our northern states and the provinces of Canada that have enough snowfall have snowshoeing parties.
When,"these snowshoers have traveled far enough Into the country and through the woods to develop a healthy ap- petite, a big fire is"

A,"freshman has usually lived some seventeen or oighteen full years before she pre- .<*ents herself to a university for ex- periment. If in that time she ha.- acquired nothing stable upon which to base her college experiences, her university is not entirely to blame for the result."

may,be a tfreat team next Saturday or she
may,"be just another football team. Bill Roper, Princeton coach, praised the WiMcaLs highly at the beginning of the season, after they had run up three touchdons on his Princeton Tigers in the first half of a practice S^ame. But Roper's praise ha.-n't meant a .successful .sea.son to the Main Line force, and Princeton's sub.-^equent work in her jrames has not"
made,"V'il- lanova's practice-game showing too sfKH'taculai'. Gettysburg Win Costly Gettysburg's vi<<tory was a co.stly one for the Wildcats, for the senices of Morgan and Highfield, star backs, were lost for the season."
\ew,"York University's powerful team rolle<l up 20 points the next Saturday to .squelch the Wildcats. Villanova followed these reverses with two brilliant vic- tories. Boston College fell under a 7 to clawing. Temple lost a close one-point decision to the .Main Liners, but Stuhldreher's team played small ami alert football and de.served to win. Villanova will take the field Satur- day with a determination to win, for a Bucknell defeat will not only re-"
move,"some i>f the bitterness of last year's 9 to reverse but it will also redeem to a large extent an otherwise <ireary .'*-eason. Casey, Captain BifT (Gardner, and Peterson played stellar ball for th * Cats against Duke last Satunlay. Gardner"

game,"in good shape, they have an excellent chance of breaking the"
New,"Yorker's winning streak. The halfbacks on the loctd team are all und( r treatment for injuries incurred in the State ami Gettysburg frays. The play of Koster at wing has been of high calibre and he will, in all probability, start at a wing post. The choice in the goal is undeci<led as Yust and Stearn are both playing the I'Dsition in great .shape. Cornell is a"
member,"of the Inter- collegiate Soccer Association, and"
Navy,"is also. Through playing teams of the league, it is possible that Buck- nell"
may,be made a
member,of thi- as.soclation. The
game,"at Ithaca is to be played a.- a preliminary to the Cornell- hobart football game, at which the Bucknell team will be guests."

Two,of Brumbaugh's dashes meant Orange and Bine scores. Clark Hinkle clicked off
US,yards for his after- noon's work and accounted for Buck- nell's other tally. In fir.-.t downs the Bisons led
KJ,'o 0. Ten of the.se Ifi ten-yard advance -i came in the first half when th<- Bisons swept everything before them in their lush for victory. Penn .State was penali/.e<l almost as

now,Buck- nell.
He,"spent his boyhood in Lewis- burg and is remembered by a few of the older resident."". In 1916 he was given the degree LI.. l>. by Bucknell. General Bli.ss was the war-time chief of staff and a one-time com- manding general of the army, and leW an active career for"

member,of the Supreme
War,Council of the great
war,to die. Colonel iHouse being the survivor. The other
members,"were President Wilson, Robert I^nsing, and Henry White. Prominent in Bucknell's history"
was,"General Blis.s' family. His father, George R. Bliss, was the fir.st pro- fe.s.sor to teach at the Univer.sity and at one time was acting president. The Bliss family"

He,
was,"initiated into the Phi Kappa P.si fraternity in 1x70, becoming the 154th"

sided,a short time later. This
was,"due to the fact that the president of the University at that tim<<. Dr. Justin R. Loomis, was violently op- pose<I to fraternities and would admit no one to classes"
who,
was,a
member,of any Greek letter society. In 1871 Genei*al Bliss received an appointment to the

Victorie> over GettysburR. Penn >tate. and \ iUanuva have made Buckneil- ians forget that Temple night game, and the Owls one-point victory. The fact thai Bucknell has never beaten the Presidents has been for- gotten, as Bucknell fans have watch- ed one of the great Orange and Blue teams bowl over sturdy opposition. If grid followers were disposed to think that the current Bison team's streak of wins was just a re.sult of breaks of the game, their opinions hold no weight after what happened at Scranton Saturday. Bucknell proved her fighting qualities, proved that she could come back in the face of defeat. Pittsburgh alumni are planning a gala time, for this will be the Bison's first football %isit to the"
Smoky,"City in ten >ears. Buck- nell is confident of victory, and Washington and JeflTerson ex- pects tu repeat their 1929 win. Washington and Jefferson is re- puted to have another strong team this year, although its record to date has not been impressive. Temple was barely able to eke out a victory over the Bisons in Philadelphia, but the Owls had little difficulty in slip- ping under the wire ahead of the Prexies, 20 to 7."
W.,"and J. defeated Lafayette in the Atlantic City audi- torium by a 7 to score. Lafayette played a scoreless tie with Penn State and Bucknell defeated Iht Lions ly to 7. All of which proves nothing. Bill Amos, former All-.\merican back is coaching the Presidents. (Continued on Page 7.)"

26-6,Bucknell's freshman eleven con- tinued its long string of victories at the expense of the highly touted Dickinson Seminary team in an
Arm-,istice
Day,struggle at Williamsport. The score was 2<<) to <!.
The,"Seminary team scored first, but the yearlings, not at all daunted, continued to put on the pressun', with the result that they rolled up four touchdowns before the encounter was over. The varsity s(iuad, taking ad- vantage of a day of rest, traveled to Williamsport to watch the frosh do battle. .\ feature of the"
game,was Peters' return of a Dickinson kickoff.
When,"it looked as if he was about to break free for a score, he"
ws,caught on the Williamsporters' fifteen-yard line.
A,"score followed clo.sely upon this ad- vance, however. Priest Gets 2 Touchdowns The .scoring honors went to Prie.^t"
who,garnered
two,"six-pointers. Meyers got another, while Endler snared a pass to tally the other."
The,"scoring was evenly divided, with the yearlings tallying a touchdown in each quarter. James converted tw^o extra points to bring the score to 26. James did alnio.at -ill of the kicking for the frosh, and on one occasion cros.sed the opposition by tossing a pass to Endler for a gain of some 25 yards. There was"
onh,one bad feature that m;irred the
game,"and that was that four of the regulars were in- jured. Karina had his had ankle as wa.s The full extent This hospitality extended on part of the co-eds is a direct result ' twisted. Vehrey was hurt, of a .similar custom .started during"

""The basic rea.son for choosing the subjects of. the lectures entered in the course thus far has not been their literary jrreatness, -but rather their effect on the types of world litera- ture. ""Paradise Lo.st"" differs in this respect since it influenced world i thought rather than world literature. It has inspired no great epic poems .'^ince -Milton's time. In general, the theological and cosmological theories of the civilized world today, with only a few e.sceptions, are tho.<<e of Milton,"" .said Dr. Robbins today. ""Milton, however, exerci.sed a pro- found influence in the u.se of blank verse forms. The type of blank veise which he used differs from th>> Shakespearean form and has been"

named,"I/edbetter and With golf courses to right of 'em, golf courses to left of 'em, and golf cour.ses in front of 'em, both standard size an<l dwarfs, it is no wonder that Buckneli students are becoming ""golf minded,"" and th;it they are interest- ed in knowing all there is to learn about golf. Concerning ""grown-up' golf there is little to tell that is not already commonly known It is a"
game,"as old as the hills. Scotchmen havo played it for generations, though other peoples have di.scovered its charm comparatively recently. So old is tills game, in fact, that its origin is shrouded in the mists of the long ago. But the story of iiiinature golf is another thing. There are two inter- e.>5ting and out.stamiing facts about this"
pygmy,"form of the game: first, the swiftness with which the vogue for in.stalling these tiny courses and playing them has swept the country; and, .second, the barriers that had to be overcome before the provoking obstacles to .successful putting could be built. MacDonald Has First Course Bob MacDonald,"
a,"famous golfer and instructor, years ago put in a tiny putting course in a building in Chicago, for his pupils. There were perhaps a half dozen other intloor courses scattered over the country, but none of"
them,proved to be very successful financitilly becau.se the putting surface was either a carpet or hard packed sand or some other unstaisfactory material.
The,"idea wTas merely a curious toy which, play- ed once or twice, had little or no , harmful to good golf and it has been said, ""in a few years this country is ' * *>..*,,* ."" amount of interest. However, they ran into some hard luck, for the elemtns sometimes destroyed their course; but every morning they would carry up more .sacks of .sand and clay and rebuild it. They finally"
won,"such a success that they were able to build two more courses, at Columbia and Dreamland Parks in"
New,"Jer.sey. TI.ese also were sand and clay cour.ses and presented the >>ame difficulties as the skyscraper course. Convinced of Future Led better and Delanoy began to ex- periment, being firmly convinced that there was a future for this dwarf pastime. They tried everything from sawdust to feathers, but found noth- ing altogether satisfactory."
One,"day someone asked if they had ever tried cotton.seed hulls. They hadn't, but tiiey did, and they were disappointed. Til.' crushed hulls were lumpy, oily, and unsightly. .4fter"
many,"experi- ments, they (ILscovered a green dye tliat was .satisfactory und at the same time acted as a binder. Success was theirs, so a company was formed. The next big step came when Mr. Carter,"
^,"hotel owner in Tennessee, walked into the offices and said that he thought that a little course would help his hotel business. Also he had an idea that real obstacles on the little ftiirways would add to the play- er's perplexities and enjoyment. This idea, once it"
was,"put into practice, proved to be universally popular, and fin.intially, was a .small gold mine. There is"
much,that can be said both for and against the game. It is guests of the

man,
--,a
man,
who,"was not only .-killed in the machination!* of war, but"
who,
was,also a leader in time.>; of peace and who
knew,
how,"to best bring about peace. Certainly, .such a personaKe is a rarity in these"
^ays,of cymbal-clafihinjf militarists
on,one hand and idealistic pacifist.s on the other.
On,"this account, the United States will feel General Bliss' loss more keenly as the passing of time permits a view of his notable career I jfi retro.spect. j"
The,happy combination of war lord and peacemaker in General Bliss
was,"keenly recognized by that great hu- manitarian President,"
Woodrow,Wil-' Ron. It
was,"probably for this reason | more than any other that Wil.son j chose him to represent arms on the American delegation of the Supreme,"
War,Council.
One,
who,was .singled j out of a score of other military lead ers for such a delicate task must have had genuinely great and desirable- qualities. Bucknell should be proud to have contributed something to the educa- tion and background of Tasker
Howard,Bliss.
MUSIC,
WITH,
WORDS,All future musical jn-ograms at Bucknell
may,"be censored by a com- mittee composed of the entire faculty of the School of Music, according to; reports from that department. The; idea is a good one, though not a"
new,"; one. Since it will tend to raise the' .standard of all'mu.sical offerings to come, it ^should be lauded. This"
new,idea was Inaugurated Tuesday evening
when,Professor Paul Stulz and his committee met in Buck- nell Hall and listened to the entire program which the men's glee club v/ill present on its annual Thanks- giving tour. Although the notice foi the glee club performance before this group
was,"received only 24 hours in advance, the"
men,acquitted them- selves very well. They receive<l
many,"valuable suggestions for the improve- ment of their concert, and the criti- cisms of the Scliool of Music were well taken. 1( is sincerely hoped that this committee will continue to func lion in regard to the"
many,<<)ther musical activities on our campui*.
man>,"of which, like the ),dee club, represent Bucknell awa\ from home. Through this means, per- haps the band will be induced to increase its relatively small rep- ertoire of numberii. If this can \w done before the trip to"
New,"York to play at the F<<>>rdham game, fans will be spared the m<<motony of hearinu Bucknell sonKs repeated time and again. The inadequacy of our band's repertoire was keenly felt in Scranton when the Villanova bandsmen exhibited a well-bal- i anced organization which play>>-d I snapp> select i<m> that inspired the r<<M)ters and nl the"
same,time displayed real musical ability. I ll is to be regretted that thv School of Music committee
was,not organized before the
Symphony,Orchestra was permitted to play before the visiting teachers
who,"attended the conference on education held here recently. The renditi(m.< of the orchestra could have been markedly bettered had the com- miitee been functioning as it has been in the case of the men's glee club. j If the committee insi.sts upon cen- ' soring the series of Sunday afternoon I concerts which are to be presented in ' the Baptist Church, it"
may,"see fit to 1 criticize the instrumental portions of I these entertainments. In that case, ! it will bo possible to really hear the I vocal ensemble of the performance. Radio broadcasts will naturally come under the supervision of this committee if it adopts a fair policy of ruling upon all musical programs that repre.sent Bucknell"
away,from home. The committee will doubtless have
much,"work ahead of it, and it if. to be congratulated for its initia- tive and courage."

DIRT,"If any more coinmissi(ms or com- mittees are to be appointed at this ] .University, the first one ought to be j in.structe<l to investigate the living conditions in the men's dormitories, with especial emphasis on sanitation. Conditions are bad, not extraordi- narily so, but just enough to warrant a little attention and subsequent im- provement. Cognizance of this matter was taken"
when,the students living in Old
Main,"decided to get up their petition ri-questing that the present .state of plumbing, etc., be bettered. The .stu- dents cho.se the right"
way,"to go about the matter, and the petition deser^-es not only attention hut a fulfilling of the re<<|uests"
made,"therein. j While .sanitation in Main is the worst on the campus, the tw<<) other, dormitories should not be neglected, i East College, with the washroom and lavatory on the first floor directly op- posite the ever-open main entrance,^ presents a problem. So does West College, with its cave-like shower room in the basement literally pol- luted with spiders an<<l dingy with v;hat apT>ears to be a decade of dust; <<>>ven .^0 minor an item as a coat of white paint would improve the .shower"
room,"in the sunset dorm We're glad this matter is going to be aired, and"
we,"feel confident that improvement will be the result, mennliness and g.nlliness, if"
we,"re- call our proverbn correctly, bear a distinct relation. Facilities for clean- litiess could be bettered."
Personal,
Opinion,
To,the Editor: It would seem to
me,a great .step in the right direction if Bucknell should adopt a
new,"policy in regard to fraternity rushing for women. At ^ present, rushing at Bucknell comes I"
down,"upon us with n .swoop, an<l be- fore"
we,"can realize it,"
we,"have .sud- denly acquired within our fraternal bonds, an\-where from five to twenty- odil persons, of"
whom,a month pre- vious
we,had neither seen nor heard.
We,"return to school each fall anvl fmd firmly esUibli.shed here, a new class, quite at home by that time, and already"
many,"firm friendships have been formed. With the fir.^t ilay of classes, a mere ""Hello"" is all that"
may,.break the silence between fresh- j
man,"and upperclassman. This .strain- ed existence continues for about two weeks,"
when,it is partially termin- ated by that grand institution
--,"""The Pan-Hellenic Tea."""
We,meet
new,"people on all sides, treat them like oldest friends for a"
few,"moments, and by the end of the tea, are so com- pletely exhausted that there is only a !*ea of faces before us."
Nor,is it any more beneficial to the freshmen '
who,are meeting about twice as
many,"more as we. In the two weeks fol- i lowing, during stated hours only, is ' there communication between rlas.'ies. At the end of that time, choice is"
made,which will directly afTcn-t the j remaining years in college. '
Some,".say that if we wore to wait one semester before ru.shing and i pledging, there"
wouM,be too
much,'dirty rushing.' But is one semester's so called 'dirty ru.'^hing' in any .sense equal to four .years of undesirable companion.^bip^
When,
we,"cornel right down to analyzing the phrase 'dirty rushing' as it is used at Buck- nell, it means having communication | with freshmen"
when,such communica- tion is forbidden. If
we,"were to wait | until the second semester before rush- | ing, the first semester would be one j in which natural relation.ships would | exist, both old and"
new,"clas.^es see-. ing the other in its natural setting. I There would be no chance for 'dirty 1 I rushing' and the advantage would 1 I be equal for all. ' --1938. ''*-'m<^ H.B. VIDAL. Ctnltal Sutun Sail' Niagara l.ilu, N. > I niivniiy 0/ ColoTtdv, '.'-'"

An,"establi.shed course on our cur- riculum is to be given over to a new interpretation. The cour.se is Pro' fessor Jame.s P. Whyte's ""Studies in Drama,"" numbered 332, which is given the second semester each year. In the 1929-30 catalogue this course is described as follows: ""analysis of dramatic masterpieces and practice in dramatic int<<'rpretation."" In addi- tion, the study of play production is to be become an important consider- ation. The ""play production"" phrase has been added to the de.scription of this course in answer to those on the campus"
who,have said that Bucknell does not provide a branch of study of this nature.
The,"study of drama techni(|ue was introduced into Knglish 332 last se- mester,"
when,the class voted to de- velop that line of activity.
The,stu- <lents contributed to the class hour upon their
own,"inftiative, and several of the .students engaged in directing two plays presented by the Lewis- burg Parent Teacher's Association. Practical experience in make-up was engaged in by one"
member,"of the class. Next semester this class will bo carried on in the same manner. The students taking it, will study the j features in which thoy are individual- i ]y interested. \"

win,would be greatly appreciated by Bucknell fans. The
Navy,"is report- ed to be unusually strong, so the"
gBme,"i.s .sure to be an interesting one. With a ten day rest, the Bison hooters .should be able to go into the"
game,"with full .strength. Captain Pederson's hip will have a chance to heal, and Glazier's knee injury will be .sufficiently well to enable him to get back in the line-up. Ko.ster will not be at his wing po.st due to the"
Navy,eligibility ruling which does not permit freshmen to play against their teams. Biando or Caballero will probably fill this place in his stead.
To,"date, Bucknell has"
won,"one game, tied one, and lost two."

The,"Wildcat's potent paw, loaded with two big touchdowns in the first half, could not stop an enraged Bi.son which countered with two Orange and Blue scores in the second half to clinch a 20-14 victory j>>t Brooks Field in Scranton, Saturday. Villanovans were confident of vic- tory at half time,"
when,"everything seemed rosy, but they bad not counted on facing Clark Hinkle, nor had they met, as yet, the fighting team which"
WIS,Bucknell's as the .second half opened. Psychology had its rounds on the gridiron Saturday.
Ammerman,"went off left tackle for 7 1 yards ami a touch- down on Bucknell's first offensive l>lay of the game, but Bucknell didn't do a Notre"
Dame,"as might have been expected. Rather, VilUinova"
came,"back and played the Bisons off their feet, using the aerial"
game,"to .score twice. Hinkle Inspires Bisons Bucknell played football that fir.^t half, 'out .she failed to play great foot- ball. With Clark Hinkle in the lineup as the second half opened, Villanova faced a"
new,Bison team which became n mighty machine before
many,min- utes h;ul j)assed. Hinkle hurled pas.ses and scatterc-l Wildcat fur all over Brooks ?'ield as he slashed through the
enemy,"line. The big Bisnn fullback's play was in- spirational. Bison forwards began to push their opponents out of the way, as the b;icks pickeii the holes which meant first downs and victory. Bucknell's first and last scores were"
made,on the
same,"type of play, an off-tackle slice. .Ammerman's 71 yard first-play gallop"
was,a sensatioml bit of running which aroused the Villa- rova Irish. Brumbaugh's last period canter of 28 yards
was,"unexpected ilso. for Bucknell had been hitting the line for a yard or two at a time, and tho.se 28 yards seemed a long distance to traverse as the Wildcat line stif- fened."
H,inkle's plunging produced the .second tally. Reverse Play Gives Touchdown Bucknell's whirlwind score in the first quarter was
made,"on a reverse, in which"

was,unable to gain :md
was,"set back by pcniltiey. Fry kicked to the Villanova 16-yard line, and an- other exchange of kicks followed, Villpnova gaining 20 yards. Villanova put the ball in play on her"
own,".3H-yard line. Ted Casey dropped back to shoot a 20-yard pass to Captain Clete Gardner,"
who,
was,downed by
Brumbaugh,"on Bucknell's 14-v:ird line, after a .30-yard run. Nikodem nailed Gardner for a .3-yar<l loss on the next play, but Casey went out wide around right end to the Bucknell 4-yar<i line where"

Downs,It took the Villanova backs four downs to
make,"those final 4 yards, with Ca.sey finally worming his"

men,started their second successful attack from their 4f>-yard stripe where Casey intercept- ed a pass from Ross. Gardner
made,two yards at the line. Casey passed to Peterson for a 16-yard advance.' Bucknell
was,"penalized for offside, and .successive thrusts at the line ad- vanced Villanova to the Bi.son 21- yard line."

we,sym- pathize with it.
We,"have not been unawan? of conditiims there, and it has been our purpo.se to improve them at the earliest possible date. This last"
summer,several thousand dollars
was,spent in makinff tho.se dormi- tories
more,comfortable. This only

We,pro- pose to reach it as soon as posisible. It will be obvious that it is ex- tremely difficult to accomplish such change.<* while the building is in con- stant use. It
may,be nece.sisary to wait until next

A,"uni(|ue feature in debating at Bucknell will be introduced December 15, when the men's team meets the Scottish debaters. For the first time in the history of the University, Buck- nell's team will split with the oppos- ing team on the question for debate. The question for discussion will be: *'Resolve<l, that the principles of na- tionalism afford the ideal basis for the organization of world society.""

man,"on the affirmative side, while Mr. Wilson will take the nega- tive side with another"
member,"of tho Bucknell team. McCormick, or ""King John,"" as he ii; utfectionately known the length and fcreadth of Scotland, has had a re- markable career. Graduated from Glasgow University in 1927 with a Master of Art* degree and receiving an I.L. B. in 1929, he has had a defi- nite influence on Scotch political life. Started"

made,him dissatisfied with the position of his
own,"country, and he became convinced that only through a revival of Nationalism and"
by,the establishment of self-govern- nient could Scotland regain a proud place
among,the nations of the world. It
was,McCormick
who,"founded the Glasgow University Natlonali.st A.ssociation and became its fir.st presi- dent. The As.sociation's candidate at a reient election came within 66 votes of defeating Statdey Baldwin, then Prime Minister of Kngland.

A,"great variety of nationalities, trades, and profe.<8sions was represented. Every"
man,
was,"trained to do a specific task and to do it well. As a result of this modern drama will be the subject of Professor Frank R. Hamblin's lecture tonight, the ninth of the world literature series. Que.stioned as to"
why,"the dramas of Euripides had been chosen as the subject of one of the series of lec- tures, Professor Hamblin .said that Euripides"
was,"the first realist. "".Aeschylus, the first of the great tragic poets, dealt with the stories of the gods and his"
human,"characters' are grand, almost superhuman. So- phocles, under"

vx\xxx\xxxx\xxxxxxxxxxxxx*,Prior to Wyant's time the center'.s nuun function had been to pass the ^iall back on the offense and to hold his position on the defen.se.
Wyant,"became the originator of the ""roving center"" type of play. Elected Captain in '9.3 Chicago's first football captain was Stagg, but"
Wyant,"was elected to the captaincy in 181K3, and would have .served in the .^ame capacity the fol- lowing year, if his mates had had their way. After the Chicago-Stanford"
game,"in 1S94, the San Francisco Kxaminer ccmmented on his play as follows: ""Wyant, the center of the Chicago j mu.scles are tougher team, was a conspicuous character. Strong as an ox and with the emlur- anc"" of a mule, he pushed his"
way,"through the line, scoring frecjuently yards of advantage for his team."
He,is considered tiie cleverest player on the t>>'ani.
He,"is tricky and sharp, u.sing his head at all times."""
Andy,
Wyant,"compiled this un- smashable record in the days when football was asstx-iated with ""batter- ing rams,"" "" flying wedges,"" and formed,"" he .said, ""and so they have ""tackle back"" plays. Football was to be taught"
how,"to take care of not child's play in those days. thcm.selves. They are iilways on the Today, Dr."

New,"York Exchange, in an addre.ss delivered to students and faculty members, In the Biology Building, Thursday evening. Mr. Westerfield also pre.sented in conjunction with his interesting ad- dress a film entitleil, ""The Nation'.s Market Place,"" which depicted the"
many,"operations of the Exchange, and the transactons performed when a single individual buys or .sells se- curities. Not .Aristocratic"
"""We",are not trying to
drum,"up trade, but simply tryin;^ to"
make,our in.stitution better
known,"and better understood,"" said the grey-haired publicity director in explaining the purpose of his visit."
"""Many","people have the idea that the stock market is an aristocratic organization, con- trolled and operated by millionaire financiers, but nothing could ho farther from the truth. .Men drawn from every conceivable walk of life are"
members,"of the exchange """
"""When","making an Investment,"" Mr. Westerfield .said, ""con.><ult your broker the"
same,"as you would your lawyer or doctor, because it is impossible for the ordinary"
man,"of the .street to be acquainted with all the intricacies of the market. IL is a life's work, thoroughly understood by only those"
who,
make,"it a profession."""
When,"asked about the present busi- ness depression, Mr. Westerfield !5tated that business like a sick person is on its back, looking up, and hoping to be well and strong again. ""But at present"
we,"are between two ex- tremes, one of shouting optlmi.sm, and another of crying pessimism. It has left us in a state of uncertainity and relief will not come until the ma- jority take an optlmi.stic view."" ""Wi.<<e is the"

we,"look at ""Local Track-"

a,"great deal of gootl,"" he declared, *""both for its"
members,"and it.s in.stitu- tion. It can also do a great deal of harm. ""The ideal of every fraternity is to place the college fir.st. Fraternity"

now,that she ha<i been
away,for a time. She told of the interest that her people are taking in politics.
Two,"solos were sung, one by Miss Falkenberg and the other by Madeline Waldherr, '31. Afterwards, Dr. L. L. Rockwell greeted the two"
German,"girl.s and told of some of his memories of his student days in Germany. Tn conclusion, several songs were sung by the whole group. Then, re- freshments, truly"

was,"held in Bucknell Hall hist Wednesday even- ing. I^aura Coene, '.34, gave a read- ing in French. The remainder of the meeting was spent in singing French songs."
The,"French Club was org.inized a month ago iby several French stu- dent.s with the assi.stance of Miss Florence C. Hall and Miss Gladys <^alkins. Its purpose is to give stu- dents practice in speaking French, and to help them gain more knowl- edge of the French language. Following is the .schedule for the taking of group pictures for L'Agenda by the White Studio, official photo- grapher, which will have a repre.sen- tatise on the campus the entire week of December I to i'>, the week immedi- ately after Thanksgiving recess. This is the last time groups will have the opportunity to have photo- graphs taken iby the official photog- rapher; the expen.se of having pic- tures taken later in the year will be"
bom,"entirely by the group. Organi- zations not on the following list should get in touch immediately with Frank Koehler,"
Kappa,Delta Kho hou.se. Individual junior pictures will be taken all week in the sun parlor of Larison Hall. The sitting time will be from 8:30 to 1 and 1:30 to r. every day.
A,"sitting can be had by the payment of a $L50 fee to the White Studio repf-esentative. There are about 1(>>0 individual photographs to be taken, so it is imiwrtant for ji.niors to have their pictures taken early in the week to avoid the la.st- niinute rush.

\2Ah,"p Har. ""1 think the spirit of the"
German,"people was to blame for the World War,"" .said Paul Gies, assistant pro- fessor of music, in a recent talk on his experiences in the war, before the Lions Club of Lewisburg. Mr. Gies was a captain in the Ger-"
man,army.
He,told of
many,"inter- e.sting experiences, and presented the side of the .story as a"
German,"saw it. In .speaking of the war Mr. Gles said, ""I never dreamed I'd get out of it alive."
And,"1 thought that even if I did get out I should always have to be a .soldier. For conflicts such as the recent one cannot be settled by war, and there is no nation as yet .i.dvanced enough to"
know,
how,to settle conflicts othei-wi.se than by war. KstimateM Kaiser Professor Gies' estimate of the Kal.ser was particularly interesting.
He,"said, ""The"
German,people don't
know,
whom,to blame for the war. There are so
many,"parties, and the parties all disagree with one another, and they can't agree on their idea as to"
who,was at fault. I don't believe the Kai.ser ever <lid all he is
common-,ly credited with doing. 1 don't be- lieve he
was,"intelligent enough to do it. The military party took care to do what it wanted to do, and did it under the"
name,"of the Kaiser."" In closing his talk, Mr. Gies spoke kindly of the treatment he has re- ceived in this country. ""I like"
Amer-,"ica immensely,"" he .said, ""I have had nothing but good treatment. There is every opportunity here."
You,"can do a lot in America, but you have to b<< fair and square. That is"
why,"I like to live here."" David Evans, '.32, was elected presi- dent of the Sociological Society at a meeting of the"
members,"held last week. Harriet Wilson, '31, was elect- ed .secretary, and Eleanor Farquhai', '31, was"
named,treasurer. The society voted to
make,a socio- logical .survey of Lewisburg. Other activities will be carried on but will be subordinate to this main endeavor. This decision was reached after a number of the
members,
who,had been interestetl in particular problems in the local community concluded that any approach to their solution should be preceded by a comprehensive study. Will Appoint Committee According to the plan outlined. President Evans will appoint a cen- tral committee to outline the work and to sugge.st different specific prob- lems that
may,"be stu<tied. They will include the industrial and business life of the community, its schools, churches and other social institutions, and the relation of 'town and gown' together with numerous other phases of the community life. The"
members,"of the Society will be divided into small committees each one devoted to a study of some spe- cial problem. Their reports will be given before the entire group, meet- ing on the first Wednesday evening of each month. Professor R. E. Page and Profes.sor R. L. Sutherland will act as advisors for the group."

A,certain ill-famed lady of ancient history is characterized as loud
and,"stubborn, a"
woman,"subtle of heart,"
with,"office hours in the twilight, in the evening, in the black"
and,
dark,"night ; her feet abiding not in her house,"
now,"without,"
now,in the streets
and,lying in wait at every corner.
The,igoo
model,has
changed,very little.
The,prize fighters saloon
was,"her habitat, her"
fadeway,skirt
had,almost risen to present heights
and,to her progressive habits the tobacco industry is
under,deep obligation.
She,introduced cigarettes to her
own,sex.
Hold,everything.
No,
sudden,inferences.
The,slang of yesterday is
good,usage today.
By,a process of evolution the
modern,
woman,
smoker,is of
much,higher type.
She,has
moved,
up,
from,the
Bowery,to
Park,
"Avenue,",
from,
New,
York,to Paris
and,back again.
Through,the prostitution of the art of
ad,writers
and,artists she has
been,
welcomed,into the best society.
So,far. so good.
But,a
few,old fashioned folks including 89 percent of Bucknell
mothers,arc still dubious.
When,the greed of the filthy
weed,advertisers begin to advocate pipes
and,
chewing,tobacco for
"women,",we're
wondering,
what,out- cast of society will
do,their dirty work.
Unthinkable?,
We're,not so sure. Cigarettes in
your,dainty
mouths,
were,just as repulsive at
one,time.
The,College
Inn,has everything to lose
and,nothing to gain
by,
women,smokers.
An,excursion in religious faith has
always,barred the sale of cigarettes at the Inn.
You're,not doing us a favor
by,"polluting the atmosphere, scarring"
up,the furniture
and,littering
up,the floor.
When,you're
tempted,to reach for a

Musser,After
Thanksgiving,.An undefeated frosh team will meet one of the .strongest prep school elevens in the East
when,the Bison- ettes line up at Scranton in the an- nual Keystone
Academy,"encounter, on Saturday."
The,"yearlings, with an eleven-day rest since the Dickinson game, should enter the fray at nearly their full strength. It"
was,"somewhat doubtful whether Peters, a back, would be in condition, but the opinion of the trainer is that he will be available for sei-vice by game-time. Farina and"
Dorman,are also back in the line- up. There is no doubt that the
Baby,"Bisons will be extended to the limit if they are to defeat Key-stone. Coach Mus.ser,"
who,"has seen the F'actoryville tiam in action, assured his squad that the prep school outfit will be hard to down. Practices this week have been long and hard with a heavy workout .sched- uled for tonight. The team is to"
have,tomorrow for Scranton. With the season swiftly drawing to a close the chances for an undefeateii Irosh team look quite bright. Win.- over Key.stone
Academy,and
Wyom-,"ing Seminary will bring about this fqat which, here to fore, has never been accomplished by a yearling team."
A,football carried on the field during the
W.,"and J. game, in a between-the-halves feature by members of the Pittsburgh Police"
Drum,and Bugle Corps turned out to contain as
many,"surprises as ""Pop"" Warner's well"
known,bag of football tricks.
Two,"very clever little dancers, aged about six years and dre.sse<l in the colors of the two schools, relea.sed eight pigeons which flew about the stadium"
trailing,"orange, blue, red and black rib- bons. While the birds continued their aerial maneuvers the juve- nie performers proceeded to en- tertain the crowd with some really clever dancing. They executed handsprings, flipflops, and cartwheels with a surprising degree of skill. As a grand finale they did a Swedish Roll completely around the football field."

The,"fre.shmen kicked off to the sophomores and In a .series of first <lowns the sophs had advanced to the goal line. I.ou Husso, .-oph quarter- back, rushed the ball over, but failed to"
make,the point after touchdowri.
The,remainder of the half
was,"played | in the center of the field with no large gain for either team. Op. the third play in the .seconi half, ""Don"" Willis, frosh halfback, broke loose for a lowchdown from hi.;"
own,thirty-yani line. Willis left his intei-ference and bru.shed (jff half of the sophomore team as he ran
down,the right side of the field. Joe Kielb pa.ssed to Willis for the extra point.
The,frosh's second score
was,
made,by Jack Jett. when he intercepted a paiis in mid-field and ran the ball to the three-yard line.

The ball rolled to the 5 yard line, where .Arm.strong gathered it in and came back to his 13 yard stripe. Wil.^on's powerful booting kept pushing the Bi.<<on.s deeper into their"
own,"terri- tory. After .several exchanges, Ross finally picked up one of Wilson's boots on the Bison 5-yard stripe."
He,"was nailed on his 7 yard line. Hinkle wa.>4 forced to kick from behind his goal line. Arm.'>trong caught the ball on the Bucknell 40 yard line, and starte<l"
down,"the field in a beautiful run which Hinkle stopped on the 2- yard .stripe. Wilson scored on the next play. With Port holding the ball, Wil.son kicked the extra point. Buck- nell resorted to the overhead"
game,"and completed several passes for sub- stantial gains, but neither"
team,did any more scoring in this half. Hilton ChargeH Begin Washington and Jefferson's goal line was threatened for the first time at the beginning of the third quarter. Wilson kicked out of bounds on the Bucknell 43 yjird line. Hinkle and
Ammemian,in three plays

Ammer-,

make,"tho.ie final yards, but the Prexy line could not prevent the score. Fry failed to kick the tjnng point."
Ammerman's,26-yard run and short gains by Hinkle and
Brumbaugh,brought the ball
down,to the

''Red,
Devils',"By Sarah Grace Martih, '31"
"""How","to get rid of ants"""
may,"seem to !><<-' a queer .subject for a eoUege pai>er, but thiss article is an attempt to aid those ""coeds"" whose mothers did not jriv<< them household hints before tliey"
came,"to college. Of ail the an- noyitnces which might face her daugliter in college, however, even the fondest mother would scarcely think of ants. Vet ants there are,"
m,practically every
room,"from the iourth floor of the new dormitory to ""Lari.son elevation."" \i Bucknell the soune (if these .><mall red ants, technically"
known,"a.-. '*Pharaoh's ants"" but popularly called on the campus ""little >>-ed devils,"""
was,"the postoflice in lari.son Hall, though"
how,"ants jfot into the postofflce is not known. Perhaps they were brought in on packages sent by parcel post. At any rate,"
many,"a ""coe<<rs"" heart has been bioken upon di.scovering .smiiill red ants skipping merrily over the marshmallow icing of the devil's food cake that her mother had just sent her. Since the Larison Hall post- office is the central point of distribu- tion in the"
Women's,"College, it is easy to see"
how,the tiny pests spread to Harris Hall and the
new,"dormi- tory. Originated in Tropics ""Pharaoh's"" ant is the best known ot hou.se ants and has been domesti- cated so long that its exact origin ran not be determined, except to place IT in the old world tropics. In wan.i countries the red ant lives in the soil, but in temperate regions it must live in heated hou.ses in order to survive. Lndoubtedly, commerce is to blame for bringing this in.sect to North America, ju.st as commerce is doubt- less U) blame for introducing the pest to Bucknell. Red ants are not so destructive as they are annoying. They get into fuod especially sugars, syrups, c&ke.s, candies, and cooked animal food. Whenever ants discover ar- ticles like these, the news is .somehow immediately given to the colony, and ir. a remarkably short time the place is .swarming with ""rod de^il^."" l'<<>>od Ban Needed In order to drive the ants from the girls' dormitories, the first step would be to keep all food out of the normitocies. But to bring such ;; re.striction about would be difficult and, in fact, almost impossible. Since Nve"
know,"what food substances at- tract these insects to the dormitories, i the ideal solution of the problem *would be to prevent the importation of such foods. However, it is prob- able that not all of our four hundre<l I Rirls would abide by such a rule. Rut it would reme<ly the situ<tion if they would clean up promptly all -crumbs scattered on floors, and put .all their food supplies in metal con- tainer.<<, which .sihould be placed above vessels containing water. Popular cures for getting rid of artts are camphor and naptinlene fakes, powdered moth halls, or sod-"
ium,"floroxide powder, scattered about th< runways of ants. The.se remedies * often ruin the food itself however,"
and,"bring comparatively little bene- fit. If the ne.sts of the ants can be dis- covered, an effective"
means,"of ex- trrmination is to spray a little di.sul- phlde of carbon, kerosene, or gasoline into the opening with an oilcan or small syringe. .'>'ince thcs^-substanciis are inflammable, some caution is im- portant. Baits, such as"
sm,"ill sponges moist- ened with sweetened water, can be used to attract the ants. Put in places where they can easily be jeached, the sponges will prove to In? an irresistable bait. They should be collected .several times daily and the ;'.i:ts on them destroyed by being ini- mer.seil in hot water. These baits are most useful, however,"
when,"the pres- ence of the ants is first di-scovered, and the colonies are still few and small. Poison Syrups Effective Poisoned syrups, which are also poisonous to"
human,"beings and do- mestic animals, are the most efficient means of destroying red ants. The United SUites Department of Agri- culture has prepared some formula.-^ for the.se syrups, such as the fol- lowing: ""(1) One pound of sugar dis-solved in a quart of water to which should be added 125 grains of .sodium arsenate. The mixture should be boiled an'l strained, and on cooling use<l with sponges, as al- ve^idy described. The addition of a small quantity of honey is said to add attractiveness to ants. Other syrups gain their effectiveness from I sodium arsenate, thallium sulphate, ! anil tartar emetic. The idea behind i all the.se .solutions is th.it the ants will collect the sweet flui<ls and con- vey them to their ne-sts; then the colonies will also die after feeding upon them."
Some,"of these destmctlve com- pounds are, of course, too complex I to be prepared in the kitchenettes ' of the ""Sem;"" but surely the ""coed"" chemistry ""sharks"" should be willing to lend a hand and help to get rid of the.se pests. The simpler meth- i ods, such as preparing sweetened water, any ""coed"" can follow for herself. If all would unite in a determined effort to wipe out the ants, they could be exterminated. I"

many,"points of lmportanc(. were questioned and discus.sed by lea<iers of the Jews, Catholics, and Protestants. SufiTgrestions for solution of the <|uestion, ""The Kxtent of Ueligious Discrimination and"
What,"Can Be Done .About It"" were: ""that a pro- Ifnon of religious education be in- au^rate<l in our public schools;"" ""that every community should have public talks given in the form of a I lecture series by"
men,from the trades j and professions
who,are
members,"of the various religious faiths;"" ""thati American children be taught"
how,the ! children of other nations and faiths live so th;it the 'foreigner feeling' might be done

The,Catholic viewpoint

""That a liberal education is of the utmost value to students expecting to <lo newspaper and magazine work,"" is the belief expressed by Dr. L."
E.,"Theiss, writer ami professor of jour- nalism,"
who,"has been a contributor t<<> more than 40 magazines, and is the author of 19 books. To understand the wants of the iiiodein reader, the present day writer must have a broad background from which to draw his material. Dr. Thiiss says that newspapers and magazines are read by people of edu- cation and culture whose tastes de-"
mand,"reading of a high quality. ""In this respect,"" he said,"
"""we","have passed beyond the age of the mono- sylbble and of monosyllabic thought. The more educated we become tho more complicated are our ideas and our speech."" Dr. Theiss says it is true that ""style is the man."" In other words. as a"
man,"is, so does he write. Edu- c;-tion, experience, self, all go into the st\ le of the work. Culture"
Forms,Character
"""What","is absorbed of culture and knowledge becomes a part of one'.^ character,"" he says. ""In thi.^"
man-,"ner literature, art, and music become a part of us. These factors are like- ly to be passed on at any time through thought expression in either written or spoken form. ""The individual raised on the street and bred in the ways of vice, thinks of everything in a wrong, licentious manner. * So it is natural that the speech and writing of such an indi- vidual is tainted with viciousness an<l licentiousness."
On,"the other hand, if the person is reared under cultural"
and,"educational influences, h i * thoughts are on a higher level. Tiie products of this individual will almost cortainlv be clean and decent."""

made,by any pitcher. Connie .Mack in selecting his team has words of hfghe.st praise for his pitching selection.
Mack,is unstint- ing in his prai.se of the
man,
who,started his brilliant career on the Bucknell campus.
He,"writes of Christy: ""I pick Chri.sty Mathewson for"
my,pitcher because he showed th;>>t divine power from the minute he entered the majors in 1901. More than ten year- passed and he
was,still the mightiest pitcher of the Giants and the beau i(!eal of National I.EURague flingers.
WaH,"a Winning Pitcher ""Matty"
was,always u winning pitcher and at his best when
much,wa.s at stake.
As,"a matter of fact, he was unbeatable in his prime in an important"
game,"or series. '^He shut the Athletics out three timers in the World's Series of 1905, a pitching feat that has never been matched and"
may,"never again be equalled in this classic. ""Cool and brainy, his control was remarkable. Nobody ever waited him out. His curve ball was unhittable. ""Matty had size, build, peisonality, everything in his favor. There never has been .euch a pitcher before or since."""

"Coates,",'12 Left halfback I at Pittsburgh in the
W.,"and J. game, Alvin ""DofiTRie"" Julian, '23, head coach of football at Albright College, has resigned as grid mentor at the Keadinf school. Julian gave no rea- sons for his resignation."
The,former Bucknell star resigned his post before the ifame with W<<st-
em,"Maryland last week, in which his"
t<<am,"tied the powerful Maryland eleven. Julian has been head coach at Al- bright since 1925. His teams have compiled a successful record of 34 victories, 17 defeats, <<n<l two ties in that time. Under his guidance Al- bright has built up quite a reputation among^ small Ea.<!tem colleges. Under his tutelage, Albright has scored .sev- eral notable victories, that over"
Temple,"in '28, and that over Davis Elklns last fall, being especially prominent. This year the Lions tied the great We.stern Maryland club, which had been undefeated and untied this fall in"
Hastem,"football. only to aggravate his injury. It looked as though Shan had play- ed his last game, but .several had not given up hope; two of these were"
Ammerman,himself and Dad Hoskins. Hoskins was the doctor and .Ammer-
man,the patient for a good
many,"hours in the days preceding the f\>rdham game. Hoskins was rather <lubioiis about the result, but"
Ammer-,
man,wasn't and
Fordham,had to face the slippery Snavely back. Becomes Ground Gainer
Ammerman,ende<i his ten years of football by becoming one of the most consistent ground gainens that Buck- nell has had in .several .sea.sons. Shan played football at Tyrone High School and the
New,York Military
Academy,before enrolling at Bucknell.
He,was a pupil of Mai Mus.ser as .i fresh- man.
Ammy,
made,"the varsity squad in his second year. I^st year the injury jinx was on his trail, and"
Am-,
merman,was unable to play the greater part of the schedule.
Much,of Bucknell's grid success this fall has been due to the fine ball carrying of this 165 pound dynamo. .\mmerman's .specialty is picking
up,yardage on off-tarkle plays.
He,is seldom stopped short of four or five yards on his off-tackle slants. Temple had more trouble in stop- ping the Tyrone XaA than they had with any other Bison back.
The,"Owls were unable to stop his .savage thrust"", until a severe ankle injury laid him low."
Ammerman,"was de- clared to be out for the season, but the following Saturday he appeared with a slight limp, but as good a.4 ever at piercing an opponent line. At Scranton,"
Ammerman,broke loose for a 77 yard dash off-tackle on Bucknell's first offensive play.

At,half time the Kingston teiim was leading the Bi.son Yearlings by a 6-0 count.
A,rejuvenated BuckneL team came out of the dressing room in the second half to run up a 20 point lead.
The,

well,"fought throughout, with the frosh line per- forming in great shape from end to end. In the third quarter the em- battled fro.sh held the Kingston out- fit on their four-yanl line, for one of the be*t defensive stands of thi V.arae."
The,"entire backfield was clicking in great shape throughout the second half. Peter.s, Vehrey, Meyers, Priest, and Heydrich were the most con- sistent ground gainers."
On,"the line there was no out- standing performer, but the"
work,"of the entire"" forward wall left little tf> Ik. desired. F'arina at center ana Donniin at guanl were in every play."

Next came the occu- pation of the Turkish port of Smyrna,"

whom,to the Turks were the most despised of the allied nations. The third was the Treaty of Sevres which virtually me.int the destruction of the Otto-

That reRular chapel exer- cises have KTii&i value for students wonder, his humility, in ways other than religious is point- ed out in a recent issue of the Yale Nfws. which devoted two tolumns t'> reporting a discussion of the matter by the Rev. Elmore McKee, chaplain of Yale University. Chaplain McKee, in the light of his years of experience at Yale, says that one of the jrrcat values of col- lege chapel is its unifying effect upon the student body. In his last two services before the Christmas vaca- tion he gave two addresses on this general topic, the first, which is here quoted, in part, being on the subject ""Yale's Diversity and Religion as Its Unifier."""
"""We",become riveted to 'dw frag- ments of a university before
we,be-
come,"conscious of underlying uni- tie.s,"" Mr."
McKee,"said. ""Students find them.selvcs separated from their fellow-men through the fragmenting effects of intellectual divisions sug- gesteii by the course of study. Grow- ing out of separate departments of study and tlie .separate intellectual interests which they stimulate, there wise sepaiate ))rofesslonal interests. Interests Cause Fragments '*There are the fiagments liased on .*^*cial distinctions - fraternity and flub and society groupings, quad- rangle and <iormitory divisions, and in some univer.sities even national or racial separations occur in spite of efforts to minimize them. ""There are fragments caused also by the different pursuits a"
man,en- srages in during the time
when,"study and club life and professional inter- ests are not in the forefront. ""There is one great word which viands for a great experience which binds us all together. It is the word '.Seeker, and its derivative. Search. ""We"
may,be unaware of a
common,"goal to our quest, but we must r<H<>>g- nize a"

Can,
we,not see what a splendid quest is
summoning,"us in each fragment, and what zest it can bring? But is there nothing which can bind to- gether our fiagments into a whole?"
Yeg_the,Search itself unite.s us.
We,"are all seekers, a.sking. 'What is"
my,"chemistry,"
my,"engineering,"
my,"forestry,"

What,is

What,is

As,together
we,".seek, is there some"
common,good which
we,"glimpse, even from our .separate vantitge points?' ""Thus our ho.st of seekers, each treading his lonely mountain trail marked, 'a .study in spruce seed' or 'the gasoline engine' or 'the amoeba' or 'Chaucer' or 'unemployment* or j.mntg'abnge ieo'tehel iea'sonhreo'niF *cancer' or 'Beethoven' or 'the Gothic arch* or 'rowing' or 'Alpha Delta Phi,' finds his footpath leading him and other dissectionists to a country"

"""And",so
many,of us have been looking forward to the day
when,"a n e \v chajud, jjresumably Gothic, would be erected at the center of Yale's busy highways and depart- mentalized life as the great unifying vorship center, to which all the deeper levels of our academic <iuest lead us."
We,"do not want a building just for the sake of having a build- ing, but because it would be the logi- cal outcome and the crowning glory of the university's deepest purposes."
The,building would
embody,"in its architecture the academic spirit, the Yale spirit and the Yale heritage, the"
New,"England and the .A.merican spirit, and the still wider .sweep of the religious spirit and the Christian spirit through history. It would truly be a hou.se of prayer for all people."" Because the graduate manager of! 1"

IS,"$1,662"
The,more education an advanced American
womnn,"get.s, the more she tends to devote her life to social ser- vice instead of makinjf money, is the startling revelation"
made,by the bureau of Business Research of the University of Michigan at
Ann,"Arbor in a recent survey of 14,073 business an<i professional"
women.,"Three-fourths of those iin.swering the questions put to them by the bureau were employed in commer- cial, educational, and manufacturintr organizations. The annual income of the"
women,"wa.s found to be $1,<)62, a\jj f.\\y 0.7 peixent earned $3,000 or nijre. College"
Women,Earn
More,
"""Women","who have been graduated from a college or university,"" .says the report, ""are earning more in evei-j' kind of work than"
women,"with less education. ""They tend, however, to concen- trate in lower paid fields, such a^ teaching and clerical work. They do not tend to select occupations where chances of high financial rewards are l>e<<t. ""Seventy percent of the.<<e college"
women,"are in the employ of educa- tional, social or welfare organizations."
Why?,Ls it because college
women,can afford to overlook questions of earnings ? Are the Inherent satisfac- tions of the work itself more import- ant to them than financial returns?
May,it be that teaching and welfare
work,seem to college
women,more socially approved ways of earning a livelihood ?
Or,is she unaware of the opportunities in these newer fields of
work?,"Perhaps the true an.swer is a composite one."" !"

STEWART'S,
REPORT,
IS,
PUBLISHED,Professor
N.,
H.,"Stewart's paper, the ""Preliminary Report of the Oc- currence of the Nose Fly in the Deer of Pennsylvania"" was published early this"
week,"as part of ""The Pennsyl- vania Deer Problem,"" Bulletin No. 12, of the Board of"
Game,"Commis- sioners. Dr. Stewart's work of the no.se fly is published in conjunction with an explanation of the antlerless <<leer season and a report of the work of State College on the poisonous effect of a laurel and rhoddendron diet on the deer. Another fact which only goes to prove that the coming generation is not (juite as bad as it is .sometime-^ depicted has come from the depart- ment of physics here, as one of the results of an experiment done"
by,"John C. Hostetter Jr., '34, a .student in chemical engineering. It seems that young Hostetter's father, John C. Ho.stetter, class of 190J<, performed an experiment back in 1906, the records and data of which have been kept by Profe.ssor Frank"
M.,Simp.son. The experiment
was,on the radius of curvature of a spheri- cal lens as measured
by,"means of a spherometer, and not only did Pro- fessor Simp.son keep the results, but he also pre.ser\-ed the equipment. This fall the .second John Hostetter came here to enroll in physics 111, tsiught by"
W.,
N.,"Lowry, assistant | professor of physics. Accordingly, j"
when,it came time to do this experi- j
ment,"on the spherical lens, the idea I"
was,"conceived to have him use the .""same equipment used by his father. Professor Simpson finally located this, and the experiment"
was,per- formed.
"Now,","the moral to all this is that John C. Hostetter Jr., got a decidedly better result of his measurements than did his father. At fir.st, the alibi was put up that the difference in results was accounted for by the wear and tear on the e<<iuipment, but the experts seem to think otherwise. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that this younger generation can- not be quite as useless as some of our elders would have us think ."
A,"Job Instead of a Diploma According to Nuci.t I'erlinutter, re- search assistant in Teachers' Collejre at Columbia I'niversity, in a recent radio talk as recorded by the ""Stu- dent \Veekly""of Franklin and Marnh- ull, Soviet Russian Students are given jobs instead of diplomas!

M.,C.
A.,"Older Boys' Conference, which was being held in the Lutheran church of Mil- ton over the week-end. Dean Rivenburg gave a detailed an<l interesting histojy of the Uni- versity to the assembled boys in Bucknell Hall, after the session con- vened at 3:30 p. m. The visitors were then conducted around the cam- pus by student guides, under the di- rection of Chester Owens, '33. All of the buildings on the Hill were inspected by the boys, also the infirmary, gymnasium, fi-atemity houses, the homes of President"
Hunt,"and Dean Rivenburg, and the build- ings of the women's college."
The,visitors then returned to Bucknell Hall.
From,"here, they were taken by automobiles, which townspeople of Milton had donateri to conduct the boys to Bucknell, to Memorial Sta- dium, which completed the tour of inspection. The boys were driven souvenir photographic post cards of the University. The .student guides were: Chester Owens, '33, David L. Grifl^ths, '33, F."

Years,
Ago,
An,"illu.strated lecture, ""Glass and Glass Products,"" was given by J. C. Hostetter, '08, director of the re- starch and d>>*velopment department of the Corninjf Glass Co., in the crowded lecture room of the Chemis- try Building,"
Monday,evening.
A,"similar addre.ss was given by Mr. Hostetter in 1910, two years af- ter he"
was,graduated from Bucknell.
At,"that time he was connected with the BuroHu of Standards. Fur the la<<t 15 years .Mr. Hostetter has been with the Corning Glass ('o. at Corn- ing,"
New,"York, and from experience and information gained there has en- larged the hnrture. The lecture was illustcited with 100 slides and there wa.s a display of about 4r>U .samples of glass products, .\fter an hour and a half lecture. Mr. Hostetter"
was,"kept busy for another hour an- swering student's questions. Beginning with a perimi 3000 years ago, the Bueknell chemi.st traced the history of glass nnd its u.se along with the development in the processes of manufacture. The change In de- sign bf furnaces used in the making of glass leading toward a continuous. Icrfpe .scale production, and the auto- matically controlled furnace, capabK- of handling several hundred tons at a timte,"
was,"shown. Traeeii Ghtas Hiiitury Different types of glass, colorless and colored, including stained and decorated window panes, plate and optical glass; glass used in the trans- mission of ultra-violet rays and a"
new,glass to absorb tho.se rays were described. Mention was
made,of light bulbs and radio tubes. There
was,a slide shown of a machine which
makes,"400,000 r.idio tubes in 24 liours, or 2(M>,000 light bulbs in a like perio<l of time. Mr. Ho.stetter are fully explained the process of fro.sting the inteHor of light bulbs, accomplished by an etching device.

Bessie Snyder's colorful portrayal of the effervescent Dulcy has been widely discus.sed."
When,"George Kauffman and Marc Connelly con- ceived their .satiric comedy, they placed the primary responsibility upon tile title character. .Miss Sny- der realized that fact. Except for an over-emphasized line or two, her Interpretation of the role was charm- ingly realistic and aglow with per- sonality. She is entitled to"
know,"that a more convincing Dulcy could not have been found. Characters Range Widely The potpourri of charactt.rizations provided by the Kauffman-Connelly wit ranged from the lovable, innno- cently-interfering Dulcy, who charit- ably hired a butler with a pri.son ncord (Robert Walsh, '34,"
who,"gave an admirable exhibition of facial con- trol by remaining entirely immobfle at all times),"
down,"through an as- suming, talkative advertising agent who has"
made,"the country ""Forbes- (on.-^cious,"" un<ler the gui<lance of Philip Ro.scarell, '32. Of the guests at Dulcy's party, Vincent Leach, played by John James, '.12, was decidedly the most prominent, not only becau.se lie \ie- canie most annoying to all of tht"
men,"folks concerned, but l>ec.iuse his contributions to the action of the play were done with such perfect finesse. His clever imperstmation of the celluloid genius was superb from the"
moment,"he burst into the Smith living room with a huge box of candy under his arm, until he disappeared, eloping with .Angela, his ""dream girl."" Two Loving .Martym John Anderson, '31, and James Lees, '34, both injected into thteir roles the desired amounts of disgu.st and martyrdom to"
make,"convincing the f>>cl thai wives an*i business can't be mixed. .Anderson, as the gruff, rheumatic capitalist,"
made,"the best of ina<>equate make-up by af- fecting a business-like tone which was always conv-incing. Lees, as ""Gordie,"" displaye<i *;! proper degree of rciterve in speech and action, a trif?e too"
much,"of it at the outset of the play, but later he created a pleas- ant contrast to the excited pace key- noting the plot."

The ability he evinced at the ""grand"" was another feature which colored his part. Lawyer Patterson, George Abernethy, who took Van"
Dyke away,"v.ith him, provided the play with an- other contrast by his deliberateness of speech. Freshmen Plea.ne Virginia DunkU-, '34, spoke with a spfendid full and modulated voice, and is capable of more difficult roles. The step-mother, Kllen Wolfe, '34. was able to h(dd her"

who,"finally married .Angela, mis.^efl fire from no fault of its very youthful portrayer, Harry Fithian, '34. The part cried out for some D'.Ales.sandro nonchalance, and choice saracasiii. Fithian could no doubt do himself more justice with a more collegiate character. C. Willard Smith, faculty advii>>er, and the technical staff are in no small"

By,H.
G.,P. Coates. '32 Bucknell's record of six victories ar<l three defeats
was,
made,against seme of the strongest teams in the Kast.
Fordham,was perhaps the strongest grid outfit in the East this year. Certainly Major Frank Cava- naugh's
Rams,"must be rated on a par with Colgate, Dartmouth and the .\rmy elevens."
Temple,"and Villanova had their u.sual strong teams. Villanova's strength was denion.strated very ef- fectively in the latter part of the season, when the Wildcats defeated Georgetown, 13 to 0, and lo.st a close, hard-fought"
game,"to the Washington State team, champions of the Pacific Coast Conference, by the low score of 13 to 0. Temple conquere<l"
W.,"and J., conqueror of the Bisons, and also ran up a large score on Lafay- ette, a team, which had a rather dis- mal record. Lions l..ose To Kisons Albright did not taste defeat once after the clash"
with,Bucknell. Julian's
men,were the only team to tie the strong Western Maryland team which had been undefeated and untied until the .*Vlbright game. Gen- eva roller) up eight straight victories pfter her Bucknell catastrophe.
W.,"and J. did not enjoy a very suc- cessful season until the Bucknell game, which resulted in her first big win of the year."
West,Virginia was also downed by the Presidents. Kach of these strong elevens ha<l individual
men,
who,were outstand- ing. The teams picked above have been chosen from
men,
who,"have played against Bucknell. Their se- lection has been based not only on their play a<<:ainst the Bisons, but on their performance all fall. Captain Jack Bonner of Temple and Mike Terrj- of Villanova have been selected to flank the line. Both are big, rangy, and fast. Their play has been outstanding throughout the seascfn. If"
Adam,"EUewicz, Fonl- ham's star wingman, had played against the Bisons, however, Bonner might have been relegated t<> the second team. Conroy, Foidhain's other regular end was also a very tine foot)ball player and there is very little to choose between him and Terry and Bonner of the first team. Meyer Kaplan of Penn State i.s given the other wing post on the secon<l team because of his fine play on a weak line. Terry, the Villanova star, playeii aggressive bail all season for the Wildcats. Fordham's Tackle Good Fordham's fine tackle^,"
Frank,"Foley and Mike Mi.skinis, proved to be as fine a pair of tackles as any team could boast of in the country. Foley, weighing 210 pounds,"
was,"one of the be.s.t of this year's tackles. Miskinis, on the other side of the line was almost as effective as his brilliant colleague. Efiwards, Vil- lanova tackle, wai> one of the bul- warks of the scrappy Irish line. Villanova's fine line play .staved oflT the savage thru.sts of the Washing- ton .State backs so eflfectively that the Coast Champions were held to a two touchdown victory. Klinger, the other tackle choice, played a consi.>*t- ent"
game,"throughout Temple's diffi- cult .schedule. Wisniewski, 202 pound Fordhann guard, was the out.standing guard to free Bucknell all sea.<<on. His work entitles him to a first team post."
Demas,of
W.,and J. played a great
game,in the President's defeat of Bucknell. His fine work in this
game,"entitles him to prime consideration. Bannak, of Temple, and Tracey of I-'ordhani were other guards"
who,played good football all season. Tracey's fine
work,on the stalwart
Fordham,"line, entitles"
Km,to
much,"consideration, but"
Demas,played a great
game,against Bucknll in Pitts- burgh and his
work,in that contest gives him the preference over the
Bam,"guard. Siano Center Choice T(>>ny Siano, Foniham's candidate for Ail-American center honors, stands out as the best center to face Bucknell. This, de.spito the fact that he was outplayed in the Polo Grounds, by Tex Goodwin, Bucknell's center. Rigney of"
W.,and J. takc.^ over the snappei-back post on the second team over such
men,"as Dono- van, of Villanova, and Kgner, of Temple, W-cause of his fine work against the Bisons at Pittsburgh. Fisher,"

One,"of the least of Coach John D. Plant's worries this winter will be the filling of his right forward berth, for the po.st will be well taken care of (by ""Steam"" Chenoweth, flashy forward. Chenoweth led the Bison.<; in scor- ing last winter, rolling"
up,159 points in 18 games. Chenoweth at 148 pounds is one of the fastest forward.- Bucknell has had in a long while.

more,successful than the first. While the percentage average of the
team,"did not look so good, the lmpn>ve- mt'nt over last year was remarkable. Last year two games were played, and both Were lest. This .sea.son one of the teams that beat Bucknell last year was defeated, and the other"
was,"tied. In the other three games, the Bisons weix> pitted against"
much,better coached teams.
The,"soccer team here had no regular coach, for while Mr. Plant gave all the time he could to the team, he could not give it all of his attention."
Uat,To State The Penn State
game,found th>> Bison hooters on the
wrong,"end of a 3-0 score. At Cornell the score v^as doubled, 6-0. In the closing"
game,"of the .season, at Annapolis, the team came through with a very fine attempt to take the lead in the second half, after"
Navy,had .scored twice. There
was,"not quite enough punch tq accompli.'>>h the task, how- ever, and the final score .stood 2-1 with the"
Navy,ahead. In the last
game,"of the year, the Bisons flashe<l a brand of .soccer which they had not displayed all year."
The,"punch which had been missing before, was there and the team functioned in great style."
The,passing
was,coordinated and the iJe- fense
was,"impregnable throughout the .second half. All these indications lead to the belief that next year, Bucknell will be represented by a very goo<l team. There will be only three"
men,"lost to the team through graduation, and there are .several freshmen"
who,"are expected to fill the gaps thus created. The .schedule for next year Li a good one, with nearly all of this year's opponents and .several addi- tional foes. The team will meet Temple in Phila<lelphia on the same day as the varsity football team plays there. They will clash with Cornell at Ithaca iin<i with"

swung,into the earlynseason grind. Last year's varsity
men,and the
new,recruits are working out daily in the
gym,"under the tutelage of ""Lou"" Marchesano, this year's cap- tain. With the"
new,"material on hand and all of last year's veterans, except Frank Lepore, hard at work, the outlook for a successful season in the ring is exceedingly liright. The interest in bo.xing is increasing steadily as is evidenct^d by the turn- out for the team."

member,"of the Bucknell team. ""Re<l"" Wilken.son, last year's 160- pound class fighter, will be"
down,to l4r) this year.
He,"is expected to fill the gap left when Lepore grad- uated. .Bienus, another"

was,a reserve in this weight.
He,"fought a very nice fight at George- town last year, coming through with a win in a tough setto. ""Lou"" Mutzel, la.st year's capt;un and a mainstay on the Bi.son team for the past three years, will l>e ad- vanced to the heavyweight division this .sea.son. Mutzel has gained weight and is"

Jimmy,"Murphy, of Fordham, and Larry Hatton. of .Albright, are the first string halfbacks. Murphy was truly great again.st Bucknell as he ran the ball to the bewilderment of the Bisons. Hatton was the spark plug of the scrappy Albright eleven, which out.scored Bucknell in first ilowns, though it was defeated by a .'^i/.eable score. Hatton was one of the chief reasons for Albright's suc- cess on the gridiron this fall. Hat- ton receives the preference over Janis, of Fordham, and Swede Han- sen, of Temple, becau.se of his fine work with a .small college team. Janis,"
who,"played part of the Ford- ham-Bucknell game, lived up to his srbriciuet of ""Jolting"
"Johnny""",throughout Fordham's arduous sched- ule. Janis
was,"one of the high scorers of the Kast in addition, so it is hard to keep him off any All-Op- ponent team. Swe<le Hansen had his greatest year for Temple. His play- ing against Bucknell alone entitles him to a berth on the .second team, but the big ""Swede"" featured in other Temple victories, and was out- standing in Owl defeats as well, as was r<<>cently demonstrated by his play against Drake University and Carnegie Tech.

who,"died recently in Washing^tnn,"
D.,
"C,","was one of the first advocates of post-war disaima- tnent. It was he who broke Marshal Foeh's plan to destroy the Bolshe- vists under the might of an allied army, a plan which he believed would brinv: about the resumption of the war."
At,"a meeting: of the Big Pour in March, iyi!>, Marshal Foch brought forward his proposal to use the troops that had been sent into Rus- sia, not only as a wall against the throateninjf ""Red"" invasion, but as a militai7 base from which to"
make,extensive operations against ti^e Soviets.
The,"situation in Kurope at the time was acute. The Soviets influ- ence wa.s threatening st:irving Ger- many, and under the direction of Bela Kun had already entered Hun- gary. Foch intended to prevent the further spr<<?ad of these doctrines by drastic measures, hoping to destroy the Soviet.s in Hungary."
When,called in by President Wil- son that he might hciir this proposal
made,"by Focli, General Bliss gave his opinion in forceful fashion."
He,"maintained that it was im|)ossible to *supress a revolution that had spiri- tual force by the strength of arms, that the world was to counteract the influence of Bolshevism, the only method that it could use was educa- tion."
The,"advice of General Bliss was followed, and instead of an"
army,"of inter>-ention, a peaceful mediator, General Smuts, was sent to"
Hungary,to deal with the situation there.

E.,Theiss' Class in Special Feature Articles
An,"illustrated lecture featuring slides of hunting and camping life in Canada were shown by Professor Nelson F. Davis to the commuters club at their meeting Ia.st Wednes<lay afternoon. The pictures, about which Profes- sor Davis spoke, represented a fine collection of wild"
game,"life taken several years ago when, accompanied by Dr. Hunt, he spent a"
summer,va- cation in the Canadian wilds in pur- suit of
game,"and fish. "".After the last outpost,-- of civiliz- ation are reached,"" declareii Dr. Davis, ""all travel is either on foot or in a ramH' accompanied by .sev- eral Indian guides. The"
camp,"is in an isolated section of northern Que- bec and about the only connection is an occasional thirty mile canoe trij* t'l the postolfice."""
On,recent trips Dr. Davis reported a plentiful supply of fi.sh and
game,were found. One
member,"of the party alone caught more than seven- ty-two trout each weighing two and u half )iound.: cluring a six weeks visit. Several fine specimens of moose and bear al.so fell prey to the s|>ortsman""s camera and rifle. The .section in whicli the Lt^wisburg n.'tuialist's"
camp,"is, is owned by a sportsmen'> club of the United States and Canada and covers a territory of ir.ountain and lakes over a five hun- <<)ied mile area. ""You'ie going home,"" .said Presi- denl"
Emory,"VV. Hunt in his address to the freshman chapel Tuesday niorning. ""There you will have the opportunity to .-^how that et^ucation is a really good thing for a"
numan,life. If it seems nothing but froth in you
who,"adverti.se it, *r if you g-ive a know-all impil^sipn, you will be hurting its r(fpuwtion. li a deeper, more genuine and earne.st spirit is manifested in your bearing and in what you .say or do, it will be the finest commendation you can make."
"""When","you go home, you will be subject to the appraisal of your family. Be careful of your attltutle towards home, and homefolks, and"
home,"ideals, all of those homely ([uaJities, which, after all, are the * best ami richest things in life. ""Try to realize that the greatest satisfaction is gained in giving, rather than in getting. Notice your high school friends. Kncourage them to"
make,something of tliem.selves. See to it that they .seek the oppor- tunity to climb to the highest point in per.-onal preparation for life. It will be a good result of the Christ-
mas,"spirit, if you can give .such im- petus to some -spirit."" Pi-esident Hunt concludetl with the words, ""Merr>' Christmas and a"
Happy,
New,"Year to you all with th"" recollection that Christmas means not getting, but rather the reverse, to see what"
we,"can give of comfort and inspiration to those at home."""

The Tribunal is a necessary cog in the pre.<;ent disciplinary sy.stem at Buck- nell, but it should be careful not to overstep the bounds of its authority, as it has been doing in the pa.st with"

The,"Bucknell boxers are rounding tnio excellent shape as the fight sea- son draws nigh. With a fine .<?tart and unusual enthusiasm, the squad ifi training daily in anticipation of a hard .season. Their workout consists of a four- mile jog, periods with the weights, sand-bag and leg exercises, and a few rounds of sparing. Stnce last year's capt;iin, ""Lou"" Mutzel,"
who,"wa.s to fight in the heavy- weight clfiss this year, has given up boxing, the squad is in rather a quanflary as to"
how,"to fill this place. The other classes will have no trouble in turning out a first-class fighter. In the I l.'i-poiind class e-pecially, there is keen rivalry, an<l ""Trip"" Terpolilli will have to show his best form to hold his position r.n the te m. After gra<luating from Coughlin High, Boerner secured a seaman'.-> job on a coa.stwi.se steamer, which dropped him ofl"" at Mobile, Louisiana. There, once again, he took up th(! noble art of self <iefense. Every port of note has its Seaman'.s Insti- tute, a pliice where sailors gather to have their recreation."
A,
gymnasium,end athletic facilities are usually a major part of the e<iuipment of one of the.se sailor's retreats. It was in Mobile that Bucknell's 12r)-pound boxer gained a wealth of experience in working out in the gymna.sium. Trains
Down,"Boernei weighed 147 pounds when he entered Bucknell two and one-h;iIf year's ago. .Not even his best friend would have believed that he would be fighting in the 125-pound class for Bucknell that same winter, but ""Mickey"" trained hard that fall."
When,"he entered school, Boerner had a ba<i hip which handicapped him ()uite a lot. Not being able to play soccer with his classmates in physical education periods, he werft into the"
gym,and exercised with the weights. His leg condition improved.
He,traintd
down,"to 125 pounds in five months, but his battle was not over yet."
The,rianger of taking pn weight always lurked around the comer. Before
many,"of his bouts, Boerner had t>> be extremely careful of his eating, so that he would not weigh in over the limit. Fre<iuontly in the days preceding a bout, he would eat just enough to give him strength, for overeating or even moderate eating would send the dial of the .scale whirling around above the limit. After his bouts the flashy little Bison would eat to his heart's content. It was no fun in tho.se days, for ""Mickey"" to fight for Bucknell. La.st year, the Wilkes-Barre boy did not have this weight handicap staring him in the face to .such a great extent. This winter, he is in great shape ami gives promise o*"" having his best year. Although ""Mickey"" is short on reach, he is long on punching power. In in-fighting he excels for his thudding fists jolt an opponent to the heels."
He,is a cnreful boxer and is quick to t'k< ndvantage of an opening. Bucknell fight followers ar;> looking forward to seeing him having his best ycir.

D.,"Marter, '.32, was elected captain of the 1931 Bucknell varsity football team at a meeting of the lettermen la.st Friday afternoon at the lewisburg Club. Marter, a former Haddonfield,"
N.,"J. High School stiir, has played two years of varsity ball at Bucknell at left tackle, l^.st year, ""Cy"" broke into several games, replacinjf ""Ed- die"" Bollinger, the regular left tackle. In his freshman year, the Haddonfield boy held"
down,".i tackle berth under Mai Mus.ser. Marter Is an aggressive player. Although he weighs around 200 pounds, he is one of Bucknell's fastest linemen."
The,
new,"captain is also a good basketball player, having played a guard position on the Bisonettes in his freshman year, and having been It regular 'on Coach John D. Plant's varsity last winter until his with- drawal from .school. This year the genial husky is"
making,"a determined bid to win his old place at guard. While attending Haddonfield High School, Marter played four years of varsity football and two years of v;ir- sity basketball. In his senior year he captained both the grid and court squads. Alpha Chi"
Omega,"defeated Pi Bet.. Phi in the women's inter-fratemity hockey finals and will retain the hockey placjue for the fourth consecu- tive year. The first game, the finals between the.se two teams, was played on Frl- <lay with the Alpha Chi's victorous by a score of 4-0."
The,"second game, which"
was,
more,"closely-contested, followed on Saturday with the Alpha Chi's again the winners by the score of 3-1. Alpha Chi"
Omega,
won,to the posi- tion of leader of Ix>:igue

Kappa,"Delta, 2-1, Delta Delta. * D(;lta, 3-0, and"

Non,sorority
won,"one game, tied one which"
was,"counted a win for betK teams, and lo.st <me, making the non- sorority team tied for first place with Pi Phi."
A,play-off

making,"a great stab at, the center position, and his tapping will aid the team greatly in its coming season."
The,"guard positions are still open, and all the candidates for that berth have been giving their best in an effort to Re- cure the position."
The,
men,trying for the positions are all experienced and have been holding the varsity team
down,"to a comparatively low .score. Cyril Kritzer, e\-'28,"
who,"was on the sports staff of the Bucknellian, is already getting a ""by line. """

"Army,",
who,"played in the first .Army-Navy football game. In 1890. Kritzer was unable to finish his college work at Bucknell, on account of low finances."
He,"regretfully left l.ewi.sburg and entered St. Bonaven- ture, where he had been given a scholarship and an opportunity to di publicity work for the collegfe. After his graduation there he at once .secured a newspaper job,"
and,has forged rapidly ahead in journal- ism.
He,"started on one of the small- er papers near Wilkes-Barre, an<i"
won,his
way,"from paper to paper until he landed on the Buffalo Kvon- inif New<<, a pubflcation with a cir- culation close to 200,000."
To,"write sports news had always been Krit- zer's ambition, and he attained it"
when,"this newspaper placed him on its sports staff, which consl.st.s of seven writers."
Though,"he did not grraduate hero, Kritzer is very loyal to Bucknell, and says that the newspaper work he did here is the foundation of all the suc- cess he has had in journalism."

Heim,"(Continued from Page 1.) 2S, 1867, and received his early edu- cation in the schools of that"
commun-,"ity, loiter, he attended the"
Muncy,"Normal .school and Key.^tone aca- demy. In 1889 lie entered Bucknell, and was graduated with the cla.<s of 1893, receiving his Bachelor of Arts de- gree"
summa,
cum,laude and winning the first Herbert Tu.-<<tin prize in psychology and ethics.
He,
won,"other distinctions in college, in his junior year receiving the Junior Oratorical prize. In his freshman year he"
was,initiated into the Phi
Gamma,"Delta fraternity, and was always deeply interested in that organization. First Taught At Bucknell Dr. Helm's first teaching position was that of inHtrurtor in I.<atin at the Bucknell"
Academy,and Institute.
He,took this job immediately after graduating from Bucknell. In 1895 Dr. Heim was granted the first Charles Miller graduate fellowship at the University of Chicago.
The,fellowship was open only to grad- uate.s of Bucknell. The following year he was reappointed to the fel- lowship and was given the privilege of the house and library of
Mward,
Hermann,"von Hoist, eminent consti- tutional historian, during the latter's absence in Germany. In June, 1897, he received the Master of Arts de- gree from Chicago, and later in rhe year he returned to Bucknell and be- came insti-uctor in"
German,and Latin.
A,year after receiving his
M.,"A., Dr."
Heim,was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by his alma mater. * In 1898 Bucknell first offered courses in economics and in that year Dr.
Heim,became an in.structor in that departnwnt. The following year he was
made,"full professor an<l head of the department of economics, a position he held until his death, or for 31 years."
When,"the Charles P. Vaughan chair of economics wa.- ereated in 1925 during the endow- ment fund campaign, the first to oc- cupy it was Dr. Heim. Dr."
Heim,"was always popular with students, and he haii in his classe-* approximately 3000 of Bucknell's .500O alumni. He had literally thou.>-ands of friends"
among,Bucknell
men,and
women,when he died.
He,was next to the oldest active
mem-,"ber of the faculty in point of service at Bucknell, having 33 teaching years to his credit. Interests Varied His interests at Bucknell were"
man>,and varied. With the help of Professor Frank
M.,"Simpson, he started the fir.st University Bock store, later acquiring sole intere.<<t and then turning it over to its pres- ent owner, Joseph"
M.,"Wolfe. In 1922, Dr."
Heim,was one of the leaders in the Memorial stadium project and
was,
made,treasurer of the St idium commission.
He,
was,one of the pioneers In th- East in insisting that business coui-ses be
made,"practical, and tiii.- insistence finally led to the organi- zation of the commerce and finance course at Bucknell. The dep:irtmei>>t is the faste.>^t growing one at tho -ini- versity. Professor"
Heim,was married to Elizabeth E(idelman in 1898. Mr.^
Heim,die<l .seven years ago. She
was,a teacher in the Bucknell Institute. Three sens and a daughter survive:
Edward,"Heim, of Provo, Utah; Uobcit, of"
New,York City; Mr.?. Charles Williamson of
Mount,"Union, and Herbert, a .-tudent at the Cornell Medical college in"
New,

Ip,The Ladder of (Jold is more than the usual- novel of mystery and adventure that
we,"expect K. Phil- lips Oppenheini to write. In this latest of his novels, which is by no means la< king in excitement, the author advances a theory for the i"
*,prevention of war that
may,indeed f be practicalde.
He,"has as his hero, a"
man,"of enormous wealth and power, whose sole aim is vo work towards the abolition of war."
He,"brings this plan to :i successful conclusion by securing a corner on the gold of the world, and forcing;!^., the politicians and financiers of the countries of the world to accept a treaty, the terms of v.diich would"
make,"any of them ijankrupt. should that nation start a war. With u charming love plot to add the nec- essary interest, one doesn't find a dull"
moment,while reading the book.

Minimized,"Carl G. Snavely, varsity foatball coach, has b"
-n,granted a patent for a hip pad to be used for protection of the hips and sides of football play- ers. Manufacturing rights have not y?t bci'n granted. The pad has been used by Buck- nell players since the Gettysburii
game,"of 1928 when there were .^^ev- eral bad hip and side injuries. Since the Bucknel! squad has u.sed the Snavely pads injuries of this natur.' have been minimized. Eight distinctive features of the pad are listed by the iwtent othee as follows: -'A body protective apparel compromising a hip belt of flexible cushion. material, rigid hollow spher- oidal sector shaped guard members positioned on .said belt .so as to cover the hip portions of the body, means for securing th.^ guard"
members,"to the belt, the base edges of said"

Now,the college student knows what to think of his professors. Mencken has told him. Speaking of the opposition
many,"young writers have had to overcome in .\merica, he .said i-ecently: ""In the seventies all the profes.sors warned their charges against"
Whitman,and to this day he is under the ban in
many,American colleges
....,But this opposition is of no Importance.

Being,
Eliminated,"Cry. s tall izinfr the consensus of opin- ion of student h-aders from coilejfe campu.seK of all scction.s of tin- coun- try, tho answers to a ((uestionnaire, presented by the student opinion committee of the Sixth Annual Con- jrress of the National .Student Fed- eration head(Hl by Lewis Powell of Washington and J.,ee University,! drew national attention from the| press."
A,".summary of the poll evinced the fact that 57 believed that ""college drinking"" was increasing, 47 thought^ that it"
was,"remaining static, Hi be- lieved it decreasing, while no one | felt it had been eliminated. Stu<lent| reaction in the questionnaire on pro- hibition was consistent with this trend of thought, since <><? favored ] nKxlification, .""^8 voted for repeal and 23 endor.-ied rigid enforcement. ] Reaction Brought Out I Reaction to the tariff problems' which was the topic of consideration, under the national and international j aspect of the program was clearly | brought out in the poll. Seventy- j .seven vote<l for moderate protective i tariff with 21 favoring free ti-adei and 25 remaining undecided. More- over, in answer to the question, ""Is | there any fundamental difference be- tween the so-called platforms ftf the two major political parties?"" 71 voted no, with .33 believing the af- firmative."
On,the desirability of a thir<l party and government owner- .sihip of public utilities the vote
was,-split.
The,"(luestionnaire further brought out that the bulk of the .student lead- ers present favor United .Statt;s tak- ing a position of world leadership in the cau.se of disarmament, and the adherence to the World Court on the basis of the Root formula. While a great number favored United States"" recognition of .Soviet Russia if a settlement of debts could be reached by the two governments, al- mo.st half of tho.se voting were un- decided. Approval of unemployment insurance and disapproval of the ""dole >ystenr' weie brought vut iii the .survey. R."
O.,
T.,C. on a com- pulsory basis was rejected by the vote and favore<l on an elective plan.

He,was aged 76 years.
He,"at- tended .school in Wellsboro and was graduated here in lsH4, with the de- gree of Bachelor of .Arts, In 18S7 he received his Master of Arts de- gree from Bucknell. The deceased was for"
many,year.> a representative of the C.
Howard,"Hunt Pan Co. .After ten years of service he entered the .Methodist mini.stry and served pastorates in southern .N'ew York .-late until his wtirement on account of di.s;ibility. Miss Flizabetli Kates,"
who,"was graduated from the domestic science department of Biirknell University in 1917, has resigned her position as assistant superinten<lent of the Stat< Industrial"
Home,for
Women,"at Muncy. to work at the State Indus- trial P'arm, Nimtis, Connecticut. Miss Kates will organize two"
new,de- partments in that institution.
The,"department of chemistry con- siders its departmental library one of the principle parts of the e(iuip- nient used in studying both pure and applied chemistry, according to Dr. S. C. Ogburn Ja., head of the depart- ment of cheniieal engineering. Volumes in this library are not only used for the preparation of spe- cial a.ssignments, but also in cover- ing the allied fields of work which are not a part of regular courses, in the preparation of laboratory re- ports, and in investigational work. Graduate students find the library a prime necessity in research work. In the chemistry library students become a.squainted with information of a popular nature and of highly technical subjects which are not con- .>-idere<I as regular work but which are profitable and broadening in the matter of general knowle<ige attain ed. Through the library the .students u.-e and become acquainted with cur- rent chemical literature and learn the source of most current informa- tion. I.ibrai'y"
Work,".A certain amount of library work is refiuired in junior, senior, and (graduate work. In the lower clas.^es reading that can be found in the de- partment library is reconimended and in"
many,ca.ses the recommendations are followed.
The,"library is housed in a separate room of the chemi.stry building. Be- sides being a place for the storing of books, the library serves as a club room for chemi.stry student.. and smoking"

how,"to enter a rumble seat. This is really a distressing ques- tion at times. For one thing no one ever wants to ride in a rumble seat anyway. What, then, to do,"
when,a party of four prepare to tour in a roadster?
Of,"course, the old advice to use your"

manner,"to enter a rumble seat? Shall you exclaim, ""Look at the air- plane."" and sneak in while no one is watching, or brazenly risk modesty and dignity by performing the feat before the eyes of all?"
Or,should you try the

What,are .some accepted topics of conversation for rumble seat talks? 3.

Where,should a

Now,
^,The heirs of the late Profes.sor Ephraim Heim have presented the Library with his collection of books which number more than 1000. They include
many,"authentic works of eco- nomics, history, iiml allied .subjet-ts and form a valuable addition to the Library, as they greatly extend its re.-iources. One of the most significant changes in the Carnegie Library of recent years took place during the <^''i''i^"
mas,"holidays. More than 10,000 volumes of governmental documents -were moved from the upstairs west stack room to"
new,"steel shelve.s in the basement, which were installed by Professor F'rank K. Burpee. Miss Eliza Martin, librarian, said, ""This is about the most difficult task that"
we,have undertaken. The shelf space down.>;tairs had to
U-,exactly nvasurcil and each volume had to be ciirefully checked before being put into it>> new place.
We,"had our en- tire force at work, and were forced to rely upon the assistance of two janitors when u.-ing the elevators."" Even as yet, there is insufficient room for the proper handling of the rows of Geographical Surveys and"
the,"Congressional Records. ""In fact,"" continued Miss Martin,"
"""we","have just begun, but the mass of books that was con.suming our floor space is now, at least, placed upon shelves."" Education students wishing to -eii- roll with the teachers' placement bureau are urged to do .so at once, i according to a .statement issued from j the education office today. Enroll- i ment is taking place every day from ; 8:15 a. m. until 12:30 in the education office, and in the afternoon in the ^ exten.sion office. Both offices are | located in Main. ""It is important that each educi- tion .student .seeking placement en- roll immediately, since after ho ha.s enrolled,"
we,must secure le'.teu; from bis references. This require.^ some time. It is impossible to give the student intelligent ecommendations until
we,"have the.se letter.^. Ih"" time for placing teachers for next year is drawing quite near."" df lured Professor F."
C,"Davis. Enrollment should be completed within the next ten days. In conjunction with placement of t< nchers. Prof. Davi.s* will speak on ""Getting a Job"" Tuesday afternoon :M four o'clock in"
Room,"I(i3, Old Main."

No,depreciation is permi'^sible at all if the

Four,"times in fifteen years, the"

some,very
modest,
equipment,occupied this
room,until the bulding
was,extensively enlarged in 1922-23.
when,the present furniture
was,installed.
About,1926.
we,
changed from,"a service type of Restaurant to the Cafeteria plan, our"
main,kitchen being
moved,to the
basement,
and,the extra space
used,as part of
our,recent layout.
A,fifteen year old
wooden,"floor, with all the ailments of age"
and,"wear,"
and,with that sweitzer cheese
appearance,that is the diabolical de- light of all
plumbers,has recently necessitated a man-sized patch of
new,flooring.
With,all the
heavy,
equipment,"torn loose for a better foundation, it"
was,not difficult to relocate ir to
somewhat,better advantage.
Our,
Democratic,convictions evidently led a
number,of students to
assume,that
we,
were,
running,a free
soup,kitchen in recent years.
Now,that the followers of
Mark,
Hanna,

have,"discovered, for the first time, that confes- sion is"

game,"of basketball. So thought Captain Lou .Marchesano and his boxing colleagues. Accordingly Demp.sey was inveigled into trying on the glove.s and he's been at it ever since. Lou Mutzel's decision to drop boxing this winter left the heavyweight rung on the team lad- <ler open. ""Jack"" Demp.sey"
may,"be the one to fill the po.st, for depite his 2(X> poundj^ and huge frame, the ""riddler"" is very fast on his feet and is a will- ing pupil. ing and secure more scoring power up front. Chenoweth and Ross were Bucknell's .scoring lights against the Lewi.sburg troopers la-st week, so the veteran mentor has decide<l to try the Gloucester skipper up front. Hepler's presence in the lineup will not re<luce the guarding ability of the team at all, for the Willams- port boy is very clever in handling the ball, and keeps tabs on his"
man,"very effectively. ""Bill"" Smith will be the center choice as the Bisons embark on another strenuous col- legiate campaign. * ***(*lUttl !(>* *********< KItllKlllll i>t**>(ll*<<<<ltll<<*l **(((*****It ***(i<<tititii<<i<<<<ii<<(iiiiMii<<ciaiit|i||t)|<<|<<<<<<(a>>fl ri'l' '^''""u ^'j' '*''""''r""'^ .^^'* '^""""'*^!"

Tomorrow,"evening, Bucknell will launch out on its fourth inter-col- legiate boxing campaign. Intir-class Sigs bouts will be conducted in Tu.stiu"
Gym.,"-Attention Please These bouts Vill be run off under the existing Inter-ccdlegiate boxing rules, which permit of no noise of any form while the"
men,are fighting.
Any,cheering is to be <lone in the one minute be- tween rounds. Start th<' spectator's boxing .sea.son out right by refrain- ing from n(d.>e-making except be- tween rounds. Your failure to comply with this rule
may,lose a Bucknell boy a bout later in the season in an inter-collegiate contest. So time vour v<<dls. * * >> i^ Hockey
And,"""IJttle Kva"" In a hot radiator league discussion with two prominent Bucknellians the other day, the subject of ice hockey"
came,up and the <iuestion was broache<l whether or not there could b*' enough Interest stirred up in a liockcy team to warrant a sextet. It's a matter of
common,"knowlwlge that the Su.squehanna is flowing under a foot or more of ice these days and the town.^people are mar- veiing at the tin-- condition of the river's ice. If it's a hockey team that Bucknell needs,"
now,is the time. << * * * *< Welcome Lafayette Once again two <<)f Pennsylvania's leading educational institutions will meet on tiie fiehl of athletic endeavor.
When,Ijifayettf and Bucknell meet on the court toniifht. ten

men,"were unconscious of that fact. About a wtM'k after the game, C/oach Plant if'ceived a letter from the West Point authorities commend- ing his team as being the finest j:roup of"
men,to represent any visit- ing .school on the
Army,floor that winter. The letter further stated that liiicknell had risen to a highly e.st<<>omed position atliletically ii.s a result of that Bucknell-

Rose led the vic- tors' otfen.se, with nine baskets. Ber-"
ky,and Wheeling each tallied eight points for the losers.
The,"""Sigs"" jumjM'd into the lead at the out.set, giving an exhibition of fine team play. The Delta"
Kappa,"Phis played gamely but seldom brought the ball v.-ithin scoring dis- tance. At the .start of the second <iuarter, Sigma Chi sent in an en- , tirely"
new,"team, but this combiiia- ti<m(lid not show the finished team | play of the fir.st team. !"
The,S'igs were leading

Five years ago the mortality rate of college graduates lost to industry through misajiplication was .^O per- cent. This has"

Harwood,Childs Wiis the speaker of the evening at the Jan- uary dinner meeting of the Business and Professional
Women's,Club of l^wisburg. Dr. Childs spoke on citizenship in some of its modern relations.
He,saiil that
we,"are losing the value of our franchise because of increasing population which gives ecach individ- ual a relatively smaller place in gov- ernmental affairs; because of the complexity of political such as public utilities; because of the increasing activities of the gov- ernment, Pennsylvaniii, for in.stance, having about twenty committees in 1850, whereas it"
now,has
more,"than forty; hecau.se of increasing propa- ganda which makes it difficult for people to judge a question ac""urate- Increase in OrganixationH"
Our,"exercise of franchise is, how- ever, less needful, due to an increas- ing: number of oiganizaions such as associations, leagues, and service or- iranizations of all sorts. Fach of these organizations has an inform- ant in Wiishington acting as an eye. Today, leaders feel that it doesn't matter"
much,
who,holds office in the government as long as pressure can be brought to bear to pass needful legislation.
He,.-aid that
some,"rulers think tin- re<'o\eiy of influence is not desirable, | as for instance in the case of Italy. Other writers, feeding that it is de- sirable, suggest that it can be ac- ' complishtMl by study. They advise, people to devote two hours u week \ to study and another two hours to di.scussion. Walter"
Lippman,.say.^ ! that !)eihaps the most effective u.-e \ of sufferage today is in establishing: !<tandaids by which
we,
may,judge the probable efficiency of
men,and policies. I

We,"have just tiiiisbed a pvausal of the newly-printed booklet, ""Life at Bucknell."" This bit of propaganda i ^-^ ^^^d, ""Her for the home .school is amazingly well done."
The,"average parent and the average high school student, af- ter leatling it, will probably"
come,"to the conclusion that, hidden"
away,"from the world in the town of Ii<<!W- isburg, there is an institution with none of the evils and all the benefits of a college. Therefore, inasmuch as this accomplishment is its excuse for e.\i.stence, the booklet is a really excellent advertisement. However, for the edification for those"
who,"read the pamphlet and are in the know,"
we,"suggest the re-word- ing of several statements which, as they stand, are hardly plausible. For instance,"
we,"read, ""In thi- from our cots hourly throughout the long nights. I Next comes, ""On the main ""oor I (of the women's new dormitory) are I reception rooms that are both ^cner- I ous in size and charming in api)ei.r- iance. HtM-e"

BURMA,
The,history of the local chapter of Phi
Kappa,Psi runs al-
most,"concurrently with the parent chapter, organized at Jef- ferson College in 1852. It antedates the first official president of Bucknell"
by,several years.
For,a decade it
was,the only fraternity.
Of,the
two,southern colleges entering the Phi Psi fold
ahead,of
"Gamma,",both entered the
same,year.
That,Bucknell prececded so
many,bigger universities is a source of pride indeed.
For,fifth place in fifty-two active chapters is quite a rare
honor,for
any,fraternity.
The,prestige of
Gamma,chapter has been built on the solid foundation of notable
members.,Unfortunately
an,ar- ticle like this is liandicapped
by,lack of space in presenting a roster of its distinguished
membership.,
Only,a select
few,
can,be
mentioned,"in passing. In reading a collection of old L'Agenda's, a"
most,"striking fact is that ""Billy"""
Owens,
and,"""Billy"" Bartol arc the only"
two,
members,"of the Bucknell fac- ij ulty, sons of"
"Gamma,",
with,a teaching career of half a century.
/,a record that will
probably,never be excelled
by,
any two,fra
^,ternity brothers again.

crown,it all. Dr. Bartol is still

END,"Bucknell came through in its first inter-cidlege basketball tilt of ' the season and outscored l^fayette his end of the round, which was' quite even. In the final two minute pericKl ""Trip"" was the aggressor and"
won,the round and fight with a last minute attack which flustered his somewhat inexperienced opponent. Boerner (Wtn Nod
A,"thrilling first round, followed by a slow second, and another fast one for the wind-up, gave ""Mickey"" Boerner the judges vote in the 125- pound class. Here again it was a case of experience against a comer. Kielb is a willing boxer and a good mixer. He has a good punch and looked as though he was going to"
make,the evening a busy one for Boerner. until the veteran threw a right to the button which dropped Kielb iust a second before the bell ended the first round. Prior to this time the round was very even with an edge in favor of Kielb. He
was,"hitting hard and making Boerner miss. The second round was very lu;tle.sf5. Boerner did not seem anxi- ous to nut (m the steam, and Kielb *was still feeling the effects of the blow which dropped him at the bell. This round went to Boerner by a wide margin. .Another two minutes of pretty punching and ducking on the part of both fighters added a flourish to the finish of a well con- tested battle. Boerner was the win- ner. Bcrley Overcomes Brown Affgressiveuess. coupled with a hard right"
won,"the decision for Ber- ley over Brown,"
m,"a scrap in the l.'i.^-pound class. Brown is a novice at the game, it being his first .])- pearanre in a boxing ring. Berh v had the advantage of adde<l weight, and of hitting harder. The fir-t round was very little more than an I'xhihition of sparring, with the aecond and third stanzas a little morf active. Brown countered well and remained cool at all times, but Bei- ley"
wfm,"l>y a comfortable margin. Captain "" Marchesano gave a plai.i (Continued"

2L,To .Meet West Point
A,trip to West Point to engage the
Army,in fistic combat is the order of the day for the following Saturday the 2Hth of February. This is thi- first time Bucknell has
met,the
Army,in boxing and the meet shouM be a good one.
Army,"has the repuUtion for turning out fighters. Buckn.ll will repay West Vir- ginia's visit of last year, by journey- ing to Morg^antown on March 11 to meet the Mountaineers in their own ring. Last season the Bisons defeat- e<i the Morg-antowners by a five to two score."
West,Virginia has almost the same
team,which
came,"to Lew- isburg last year. Capt-nin Kregs,"
who,"fought in the one sixty class, being the only"
man,"lo.-t to them by graduation. In view of this fact, the meet shouhl be an interesting one. Temple. Bucknell's oldest fi.stic rival, will be met in lewisburg on March 14. The Philadclphians are always repre.sented by a strong box- ing team and they put on full steam when they encounter the Bisons. Another"
Home,"Meet There will be another meet in the home ring but as yet a suitable op- ponent his not beifn selected. This will be announced in the near future, and it has been rumored that the Cameffie Tech"
team,"of Pittsburgh had been approached on the subject. With this attractive .schedule, ami the bright outlook for a .strong team, Bucknell should have a highly suc- cessful .season. It is hoped that in the near future Bucknell"
may,"be in- vited to enter the Intercollegiate 1 Boxing Association, There are"
men,on the Bison team who would have a very good chance in their weights in thi.s competition.

down,to the long training grind of the season. Most of the

The,lower weight seeme<I weakest In the one fifteen bout both Terpoli'li and ('ohen .seemed to slow
down,"con- .siderably in the early part of th*"" s< cond round. One feature which ha.-N affected Bucknell's boxers in the past is being remedied. Heretofore it"
was,neces- sary to do all boxing and sparring on the cement floor downstairs in Tustin gym. The result was that
when,the
men,entered the ring they were not accustomed to the give of the mats under their feet. This caused them to tire
much,
more,quick ly than should have been the ca'^e
Now,"a ring is under con.structioB, and in a few days the"
men,"will hate it for >>laily workouts. This will bo a d(cid<<'d advance over the previoija conditions, and it .vhows a growing interest in the .step-child of the Ath- letic Council. Bucknell alumni from all parts of the tri-state district will l>e able t# Kee the Bison.s in action this year, as the schedule calls for an apfwanance in West Virginia and"

may,be ar- range<l for Pitt.sburgh as well. RuHHO Ix'aves

w,"and popular coach, Joe Reno, during the past summer. He .-showed iir- proved form in taking an extra round <lecision from ""Red"" Wilkenson in the inter-class bouts. Another difficulty which confroni-.d ""Lou"" was the question of making the weight. He has been training for some time, and still exceeds the limit by several pounds. This mat- ter of taking: off weight is a tougrt one, for one must be careful not '.o sacrifice strength. Captain Marfhe.-*ano will have a chance to get even with the West Virginia"

was,"thrown out when V'ogt was lead- ing a bard right to bis opp meiit's heail. .A technical knockout termin- ated what promise*! well to be a sweet combat.

The,iK'td for raising the standards ot vocational i-ducation in the high schools
was,"the subject .liscusse<i at the mt'i'tiMsr of the Kducation Club in the playroom of the new dormi- tory last night. Marie Trunk, '31, president of the club, presided as chairman of the group for the last time. She will be succeeded by Charles Morris, '-.n, president for the coming semester."
As,"an example of stamiards of vo- <-ationa! education that might be im- proved, the commercial teacher's pre- paration"
was,offered. In the course of the discussion it
was,pointed out that a commercial teacher is insuf- ficiently prepared to give her stu- dents ill high school all that tlu-y re- quire.
The,
members,"of the club agreed that a commercial teacher, in- .stead of the year .md a half prepar- ation"
now,"accorded him should be given two years of teacher training, which include subjects beside com- mercial studies, i)lus commercial work, or two years of normal school inclusive of commercial subjects."
The,
home,economics department of the high school was also considered in the meeting. The constantly ch;inging needs of the iiKKiern home was u.sed as an argument that a
home,"economics course should be kept in a state of flux, and prepared to keep pace with the latest develop- roents in that field. The utilization of an income to its fullest buying power was mentione<l as one of the newe.st studies in the field of home economics. unusii il number of fellowships and',, . /-<<i.,u c.,^<<^^.-^ 1?^,^^.... a.<<si.stant-ships offered this year by I"

Wo-,
men,in
Burma,"were considered just a n.ce.-.-ary nuisance not so long ago, l)iit now the attitude is changing, ac- cording to Miss Hunt. Miss Hunt explained how the edu- cation of"
women,"is carried on in the various provinces of Burma, and gave I resume of tlie courses taught the.-c women. They are graded veryi <litfe)enlly from our .sy.stem, forty] percent being the averaire passing grade. The stu<lenls are Biarked ac- cording to the person being gradeil, j experience, and per.serverance. ' The Burmese"
women,"work in the I fields all tiay, although the average j temperature of that country is ninety <legrees.

With,"Dr. Childs In Bucknell will try to tret back in winninjf form Friday night,"
when,Coltrate appears at the Lewisburg Hitrh School
gymnasium,"in what should be a clas.^ic battle. Colgate has one of the .strongest teams in p:a.stem college circles and boa.sts of a victory over F'ordham. Bucknell will meet an experienced team in Colgate. ""Cy"" Sullivan, a guard, captain.s the visiting five. Sul- livan played an end po.sition on Col- gate'.s great grid machine this falli"
Two,"other Colgate grid stars will al.=o be in the lineup in ''Tommy"" Dowler and ""Johnny"" Orsi. Dowler *will be remembered as the Vrick"
who,"ran Clark Hinkle .such a light race last year for Eastern high snoring honors. Orsi is an end on the var- sity squad. Dowler will be a for- ward and Orsi will do the tap-off honors Friday night. Nichols at Guard ""Ray"" Nichols will probably be at the other guard position with Cap- tain Sullivan. Nichols is also i base- ball letterman. Harold Anderson, the remaining"
member,"of the quin- tet, will team with Dowler up front. Bucknell will regain"
much,of the *coring power it .so sadly missed on the
New,"York trip, with the return of ""Steam"" Chenoweth, the sharp shotyting forward. Chenoweth will be ready to go full speed against Colgate. Captain"
"""Norm""","Ross will be. at the other forward berth when the two teams lineup. ""Bill"" Smith, lanky sophomore, will be at center again. Smith Is a good shot, but has some faults in footwork which Coach John"
D.,Plant is trying to iron out. Smith goes through a daily 15 min- ute .session at the Tustin
gymnasium,"under the direction of Joe Reno, coach of the boxing team, in an ef- fort to improve his footwork. ""Jim"" Logan and ""Bob"" Hepler M'ill probably be in the back court for Bucknell, although Hepl.T"
may,be forced to do bench duty because of a bad knee. Hepler played a great floor
game,on the
New,"York trip, being particu- larly brilliant at the"
Army,"where he gave a great exhibition in handling the ball. If Hepler is unable to play, ""Cy"" Marter, football captain-elect, will get the call."

M.,Bond. Professor Bond calls his article
"""A","Cooperative Que.st."" In it, he speaks of Bucknell's Y."
M.,C.
A.,"as ""a defi- nite forum for the .sharing of relig- ious experience, and a field for active participation in activities tending to relea5e and direct forces which give promise of achieving character."" This is Professor Bond's idea of the"
way,a Y.
M.,"C. A. .should supplement college classes in carrying out one of the main purposes of the modern educational process, that of building character. The Association gives a chance for an exchange of ideas by faculty"
members,and students.
An,attempt can be
made,"to evaluate calmly and frankly those conflicting view points of youth and age, the one often un- developed, the other biased. Thus the Stuilent Christian Move- ment, which includes the"
Y.,
M.,"C. A., the"
Y.,
W.,"C. A., the Student Volun- teer"
Movement,"and the denomina- tional groups, becomes a ""joint stake"" and a ""cooperative quest"" in which the faculty"
member,"is given an opportunity to join hands, hearts, and mimis with youth In a"
common,que.st for the realization of the life of
God,in men.

AWAKE!,"Thi.- morning the papers r.irried n dispatch from Spain rclatinj!: to stu- -lent (listrubances there in connection with tho revolution. The students oi the University of Granada are re- ported to have caused some damafro study, which after all is the main object of our presence in college. As it is now, ii student"
may,"have a committee meeting at noon, a sport in the afternoon, and organization _ meetings two or three nights in tht' week."
As,"a result .study is accom- plished in between, or wlienever there is nothing else to <io. The aditptiun of the point sys- tem will"
mean,that the people Mho hold executive positions will be better able to carry the re- sponsibility than if they had sev- eral jobs to di\ide their time l>e- tween. There is always som<<*one
who,"can fulfill the various open- ings in activities, and candidates will tend to contest for positions better suited to their talents and capabilities rather than every op- portunity that"
may,present it- self. The Student Council will welcome to property in an effort to
make,their i any .suggestions or critici-sms which sentiments on the subject clear. the student body
may,wi.sh to make.

who,"seek an education. The enroll- ment of any college includes types answering to both descriptions. But both types upon graduation are ex- pected to tiike the responsible posi- tions that must be filled in national circles, to be prepared to have opin- ions on the larger problems that in- evitably present them.selves for solu- tion."
How,can we fulfill these ex- pectations after four years of .seclu- sion and absorption in minor ques- tions of the social campus life?
An,encouraging sign comes to us from the research work two Buck- T.ellians are engaged in with the Wickershani commission. There ar those
who,are not wholely uncon- scious of the life that eddies about them even though tiiey are register- ed university stu<lents. Yet the
number,of students
who,have attain- ed a truly cosmopolitan attitude is far too small.
Campus,"nonchalance *may be fashionable, but it certainly isn't stimulatintr."

many,extra-curricu- lar activities since there is no limit to the
number,in which they
may,vngage. It has been suggested that J^enior Council is the logical body to i <<levise some system whereby a stu- dent could be kept from taking upon l himself the bunlcn of too m-iny ex- [ tra-curricular dutie> which leave him with no time for .^itudy.

A,forked tongue of flame Darts through a labynnth of glooin;
\,"crescendo of thunder -arry. .At the do.se of his soi>ho- more year at Lafayette, Larry Foster went to speiul the"
summer,"on a ranch in Arirona. There, in the midst of the rugged life w-hich he came to love, he met with a fatal accident. The l>ook ""lArry,"" is a collection of diary jottings, letters, English themes, and po- etry, whicli were tjathered after his death by those"
who,"had been inspired by his life. It is an unusual volume, that pro- vides a fascinating story of a red- blooded college boy. The com- ments upon athletics, fraU'rnities, girls, profe.ssors, and religion were ma<le without any thought of their being published and, therefore are frank. The book's vitality comes from the fact that it is built upon the everyday experiences of a mod-"
em,"collegian. It is possible to criticize I^iiiry for a certain nai vete, but only if one is unaware of what college .students i-eally JWe. The thing you will like most about Larry's writings, is his faculty for searehin^f into the core of things. ""Larry"" is enjojing a wide read- ing on our campus."

The,"opening announcemont of tht* bouts with Catholic University, Feb- ruary 14,"
may,".surprise Bucknell rinjf followers, for Jackie Kielb, freshman boxer,"
may,"usurp the place of ""Jim"" Terpolilli,"
who,"represented Bucknell in the llS-pound class last winter. Kielb foutrht ""Mickey"" P.mrner in the inter-class bouts a few day.s ajfo, and was soundly thrashed, but tiie PlainfieJd yearling .showe<l lots of right ami a good punch in either hand. After a workout the other day, Kielb stepped on thf scales to find he had come"
down,to \>\ pounds.
The,"youngster did a lot of think- ing. There is ""Mickey"" Boenier, a very clever and husky 12.') poundui- ahead, and the lower division is only two pounds away. If Kielb can"
make,"119 pounds, he will be given a chance to show his wares against Terpoliili,"
who,
came,"out of the inter-class bouts aucce.ssfully. In tho meantime .Mex Cohen isn't altogether out of the running, for he picks up and makes u.se of advice quickly. This ll.^>-pound situation, it .seems, is still in a muddle. Buck- nell ha.s been"
weak,"in the division. Competition is becominir keener. Out of it all, under C'oach Joe Reno's guidance,"
may,come a consistent win- ner in the llu-pound division.

was,as- sistant office manager of the l>>s Angeles bureau of the
U.,P. ! Beale's start in the newspaper world came
when,"he got a job on the PIttHburRh Sun about six weeks after his graduation from Bucknell. His first experiences were in getting photographs for his paper to print, and in rewriting news stories. His <<?xp<<'rlences should be of interest to | pro.spective"
Bucknell,journalists.
They,are best told in his
own,"word> <<o we'll let George do it. Here are some of the things he wrote Pro- l fessor Lewis Theiss, soon after he got his first job: I Workft on Follow -up The first week 1 was liere 1 hadn't <<vcn located the various parts of the editorial room before they had"
me,working on a follow-up; it was a Huicide ca.se. After handing this rf- ftrt to the city editor I sat in front of this typewriter with nothing to do for about three hours.
Then,came
my,first experience in getting pic- tures. Understand the situation
--,it
was,a \-ery hot day an<i the uir wa.s clo.se. .Some
woman,had murdered her husband by cutting his jugglar vein with a butcher knife.
Now,it happened that they lived in a very sordi<l tenement drstrict.
The,"city tKlitor had .said, ""(Jo out ami get .i picture of this"
"woman""-",and that wa.-> his entire sixh'co to me. Diij I g.'t that picturi
--,of cour^- I di<l
NOT.,If 1 hadn't been in excellent running condition 1
am,afraid that family would have had two murders to its credit that day. 1 hung around that tenement house for the matter of | .ibout an hour. 1 was afraid to go near the house again and I
wa,afraid to go h&cV. to the office with- out the picturi (1 did not
know,"then, that they only get about one out of every 2.') pirtures they go after). I tried the neighbor.s"
--,"^everyplace I could think of, hut did not get any picture. Finally I worked up enough | nerve to go back and face the city editor,"
who,by the
way,"is .i ""hard boiled"" old cuss. After all"
my,"wor- ries all he said when I reported that '* I had no picture was, ""It sure took you a deuce of a long time to find out about it."" Gets First Scwip In a later letter Beale wrote: .lust a shnil twii weeks ar<> I had"
my,first scoop. It was appropriately dedicate<l with a streamer head i across the entire first page.
The,reason that the story was of such | import was that it ha<l just happened '
--,a friend of mine
who,"had .seen tho accident, for such was the story, hud phoned it in to me."
When,I had all the details there w.is ju.st three min- utes until dea<lline. I <lidn't even
know,what they meant
when,they told
me,"there was only three minutes till deadline, but I figumi it out that it was probably neces.sary to hurry. Well when they started to pull the sheets out of"
my,"tyi>ewrit>> r as i wrote a line or two at a time, I realized wh;it one of the biggest dif- ference- between the Bucknellian and a citv newspaper was. 1 want to tell you that 1 was so excited I couldn't find the keys on this"
ma-,chine. I hailn't any idea what any part of the story conti'ined. All I
knew,was that I
was,to

--,what I
mean,is that it
was,"a big story in Pittsburgh. (Always renKmb.'ring that Pittsburgh papers cater to a peculiar class of p<'ople an<l accordingly feature mostly mur- ders, robberies, etc.) In this partic- ular ra.se a young Polish girl >>'as found dead on one of the concrete foundations of one of the piers of a"
much,traveled Pittsburgh bridge. There was ab.solutely no clue a.s to who she
was,or
how,"she h.ad met death (at least Pittsburgh police and detectiv(*^, as usual, could finii none). It wa.s a big .story for tlie papers and they all had numerous"
men,working on it-- :i
man,"in the morgue, city detective, county det>>H;tive, etc. <;amplw'll. a Sun reporter"
who,"had been staying with the b<Kly in the i morgue for alwut two days, was the"
man,who
dug,up the first tip. One of the morgue visitors saying that he thought the girl's
name,"was Rosy ; and that he thought she live<i in a '. certain section and that he thought I that she worke<<i at such and such a ; j)lace. Well, about live cabs left our office .limultaneously, bound to run <<lown the different tips. In one o'' , the.se cabs was the in.^pired young ri'porter Beale. your correspondent.' It ju.^t liappened that being the youngest and greenest memiMM of the staff, I was on the trail of th * i least promising of aM the clues. I was sent to the district where it was thought that she might live. It hap- i;ene<l to be a pretty largo district ; .ini! there were Polish by the thou- sands imil the only ti)) was that sh.> had b(>l>>l>ed blond hair, w.s about 20' years old, and her first name might i he Rosy. Finds Famil> Well, 1 left the cab to wail for"
mo,"' and started to inquire around --for no rea.son at all I turned north on I'enn avenue -I might just as easily h.ive tuned east, south or west or just as easily not have gone near Penn avenue."""
To,"make a long story short, I"
was,"the first per.son to fimi the family -ther.' was I, the young- est and greenest, where tbe olde.-l and most experienced might have been. I want to tell you th:it with all tlu)se rehitives crying and shout- ing in Folish and only about 2n min- utes until d<<'adline fnr the liiiai edi- tion I ha<<l"
my,"work cut out t'or me. I didn't g<<'t a scoop on the story - with more expeiience I might have (I did not tell the city inlitor th.-^t) in fart 1 think I couUl li.mdle an- other situation sitnilar to that to the 'queen's taste."""
We,got the story as ; soon as any other imper liid and our .story was more authentic than theirs I .>-;nc.' I had about a ten minute start on tho other newspaper men. If newspaper work is always as inter- esting as it seems to be
now,I

CLUB,"Dr. Lewis E. Theiss, profes.sor of journalism, talked to both the Lewis- burjf Lions Club and the Ijewisburj? high school, on"
Monday,"and Wed- nesday respectively, about L'ncle Sam's dirisibles."
To,"give his audiences an idea of the huge size of the Navy's dirigibles, the Los Angeles and the ill-fated Shinandoah, which"
was,"wreckeii in Ohio in a line storm, the speaker said that both of these ships were ;'p- proxiniately 200 yards"
long--,"which is twice as long as Old Main, plus 20 feet. In thickness the Ix)s Angeles is 90 feet"
--,"easily twice as thick through as the wings of Old Main are high. Professor Theiss described the dur- alumin structure of these ships, and displayed photographs that .showed their structure."
He,also had a pic- ture of the frame of one of the new-
Navy,"dirigibles now building at Akron, Ohio, which will be 05 feet longer than the Los Angeles and"
much,"larger in diameter. E.\hibits Specimen Exhibiting specimens of the fine fabric used for making gas cells, and of the gold-beaters' skin which is in- corporated with the fabric. Dr. Theiss described the actual process of building up this laminated gas cell material, and of making the cells themselves. Another exhibit was a piece of the exterior covering or ""skin"" of the airship. This i.s"
made,"of tough, tightly-woven cotton"
made,"into ob- long panels, with eyelets along the re-enforced edges, so the various panels can be hooked together. Over the .<<eams strips of fabric ;ire glued fast, and the exterior of the ship is given a coating of acetate dope, which .shrinks the fabric tight over the frame."
The,"talk closed with the display of an artist's drawing, picturing a giant dirigible attache*! to the mooring mast atop the"

gram,committee in
New,York City the pa.st week. Dr. Thornton Mer- riam of Cornell University is chair-
man,of the committee of which Mr.
Brown,is a member.
The,"committee of the IntercoUeg- ian makes a .study of programs given on various college campus, with the purpose of arranging better Christ- ian programs for schools. Mr."
Brown,"i^ writing one of the next program papers, using as his subject, ""The Use of Books and Literature in the Projframs of Student Christian As- sociation."" Profes.sor Harwood L. Childs, head of the department of political science, talke<l to the"
Women's,"Club of Mil- ton on ""The Insignificant Citizen,"""
Monday,evening.
The,insignificant citizen is one
who,"goes to the polls, casts his vote, and then forgets all about politics until the next election, according to Prof. Childs. The average citizen is a"
man,
who,"has little influence on the government, and to"
"whom,","with the increa.se in population, will come a lessening of even this small influence. Another reason for the decrea.se in the control of the average citizen, cited by Prof. Childs, is the fact that .so"
many,"functions have come under government control. Then, too, this is an age of propaganda, and the citizens are ruled by it. >>"

who,"will play here February 24 in th<<' fifth concert of the Artist Course, has had an unusually diverse musical career. While best"
known,for his
own,"musical works, GrainRer has done MTvice of ine.stimable value in fa- miliarizing the works of other com-"
poMTs,"to r.mtinental, Australian, and American audiences. Between the years of 1901 and 1905, he intro- duce<l the piano compositions of De- bu.'-sy. Ravel, Cyril Scott, and Albeniz into Au^itralia. Scandinavia, Great Britain, and other countries."
He,"was first to perform the piano concerto of Frederick Delius, the Enjrli!<h composer, and the concertino of John Alden Carpenter, the Ameri- can composer, in this country. Popularizes Anglo-Saxon Music"
What,popularity
Anglo-Saxon,"mu.'^ic enjoys in En>>fland an<l Amer- ica has been due, in a large measure, to the effort of this artist, for to England he has introduce*! the best of American compo.sers and to Amer-"
oecretary,"jc4t, those of England. His"
own,"compositions are of de- cided merit. While his short, lyric compositions such as his ""Countr>' Garden.s"" and"
"""Gay","but Wi.stful"" are; more familiar to American au<<li- *nets, he has written works of more! profound nature."

A.,
Robb,The College Inn was literally
bam,"in .- peddlef's basket That attrac- tive eating house just at the edge of the campus, where Bucknell"
men,"like to jfather, after their sisters at the"
"""Sem""","have been locked up for th( night, actually had its beginning in the little basket that"
swung,"from it.- owner's arm, as he went about selling confections to his fellow students."
The,owner rff that basket ami the proprietor of the College Inn are the same
person--,"Giiy Payne. 1909, whose styli.stic ""ads"" have"
made,him
known,"to all readers of the Bucknellian. The story of his achievement is a fascimit- ing one. Step by step his accomplishments have grown with the growth of the University. Indeed, the College Inn's expansion"
may,well be considered as an accurate gauge of the growth of Bucknell it.self during the last decade and a half. WTien
Guy,"Payne entered Bucknell in 1905, ho hailn't a cent to pay his way."
By,pcddlmg sandwiches and ciindy he built up a business that paitl most of his expenses for the first two years. In the third year he opened a canteen in room 8 '2 East
Wing,"of Old Main. Here he had a bar and car- ried a full line of confections, including ice cream, soft drinks, cumiy, and chewing gum."
As,a matter of principle he never sold any form of tobacco. training table the previous year. This department
was,"operated on a j lease by three students until 192fi, | when it was"
moved,upstairs and in- * corporated in the inn proper under the direct
management,"of the pro- ' prietor. Installs Barber Chair HLs business increased to such an extent that in 190S ""Mr. Payne leased from Dr. George G. GrolT, then a profes.'sor in the University, the tri- angle of land"
now,"occupied by the College Inn. Here he built his first structure-- a mere, one-story, woodei shack. The plans for it were drawn by Mr. Payne's roommate, Hiitry Bastian, 191(>>, an engineering stu- dent,"
who,"also stlper^'ised the con- struction of the building. Mr. Bas- tian, incidentally, was the first stu- dent at Bucknell to receive an advanced degree in electrical engi- neering. The"
new,structure contained only two room.s
--,"the kitchen ;ind the counter room. Although the first College Inn was small, the volume of business done here was soon so great that the ow^ier foun<i it necessary ti> hire three student assistants. They worked in shifts. The busine.ss hours were from 7:00 a. m. to miiinight. Also Participated In Track Despite all the work ami wcrry in- cident to conducting his business, Mr. Payne was able successfully to carry his academic work and to hold a place on the varsity track team during his entire four years in college."
He,"wa.- graduated with the degree Ph. B. In 1909, Mr. Payne left"
Uwisburg,"and worked until 191.') in the South- west, first as an employee of the Fred Harvey dining-car and restau- rant system on the Sante Ff Rail- road and later under the similar sys- tem of Jfchn G. Grier, on the Park Island Railroad. Prior to his retui""n to Bucknell jn 1915 he had business experience in several leading hotels in Kan.sas Crty. The College Inn during these six years was leased and operated .^ucces-sfully by several stu- dents."
Upon,"his return, Mr. Payne re- place<I the little shack with a larger and more substantial brick cottage."
The,
new,"place of bu?<iftess consisted of five room.s-- a living-room and bed- room at the rear right, fountain and lunch counter at the front right, a kitchen at the rear left, and a pantry running out through th^ middle as far as the fountain, which occupied its present location. Built Present Inn in 1923"
The,up-to-date establishment tha the College Inn is today was created in 1923 by building around and over the Irfick cottage.
When,"it was fin- ished, the"
new,
home,"consisted of forty rooms, including four conoplete apartment* nn'l four lines of Busi- ness"
--,"tailor shop, barber .shop, sta- tibnery .stor^, and cafeteria."
The,"tailor shop was operated in its pre.sent location by Ray Farley as agent for John Prowant until 1927. Tlien ""Al"" Brushwiller from Indian- apolis leased the plant from .Mr. Payne. Under his"
management,"the tailor .shop ha.<! become a live and succe8.*ful business. To help him take care of the rushes that come a few days preceding every large all- rollege or fraternity dance, Mr. Brushwiller recently"
installed,a second pressing machine.
The,"stationery .store had its be- ginJiing in 1924 in a <lownstairs room on the south side, which had been outfitted to care for the football In the room left vacant by its re- moval upstairs, I.iorenzo Scotti, '28. in.<talled a barber chair and there operated the first College Inn barber shop. Morris Ring, the present Col- leg>>>> Inn barber, moved the equip- ment upstairs in the fall of 192rt. With the .sub.stitutlon of an up-to- date chair, the removal of an inside stairway, and"
some,"interior decora- tions, he"
now,has a first-cla.ss barber shtip in what had formerly been the faculty dining-room. The larire vacant room below had
now,become a
home,"for several stu- dents, rental for which Mr. Payne has"
made,very .small. During the la.st three years this
home,"has be- come a tradition of the College Inn; each time one student moves out, his privilege.'- are pissed on by him to some other worthy, homeless Buck- nellian. .Approximately one hundred people are serve<l daily by the cafeteria. Dining-rooms equipped with electric victrolas for dancing"
command,a very pleasant view of the Su.squehanna on the east side. Every year numerous bancjuets are served to cla.ss gather- ings at
commencement,"time, to the"
Y.,

H.,"Briston, as.sistant director of secondary education in Pennsylvania, and John"
H.,"Eisenhauer, of the Buck- nell department of education, were the principal speakers at the meet- ing. The president of the Associa- tion pre.sented th<< results of a recent ((iiesUonnaire filled out by"
members,"j of the Association which will be the basis for the work of the organiza- tion for the remainder of the year. Disucsses Problem Director Briston di.scussed the prob- lem of ""promotion"" .standards, read- ing letters from a"
number,of out- standing .school systems.
He,"em- phasized the importance of setting up .specific objectives for each high school subject and the careful or- ganization of any course of study on the basis of objectives, activities and materials, procedures, and expected outcomes."
He,recommended commit- tee organizations for the
work,"of the a-ssociation ami a choice correlation of the principals' groups in the vari- ous parts of the .state. Prof. Ei.senhauer spoke of the cur- riculum organization in the Reading high school an<l discussed in some detail the published English manual. Arthur L. Brandon, director of de- bating, has chosen Jud.son Ruch, '33, Charles Owens, '32, and Charles BideLspacher, '33, for the team to represent Bucknell in the"
home,"de- bate with Bowdoin, February 14. Our team will uphold the affirmative side of the question, argruing that the states should enact laws providing for unemployment insurance. They will propo.se sy.stema similar to those already in effect in England and Germany, emphasizing the famous $25,000,000."" This topic is of especial interest at present because of the concurrent de- bates on the same question, which are taking place in numerous promi- nent debating circles. It has been the subject of"
manv,"authoritative ar tides in large magazines all over the country, and it is at present a heated issue in the"
U.,".S. Senate. The <iebate will be held in Bucknell Hall, and will be free to the public. ""Becau.se of the unusual interest in this topic,"" said Prof. Brandon, ""we are expecting a record crowd to at- tend."" **"

The,"third ""manless"" dance, held by"
Waynesburg,College co-eds as a puni.shment to
men,"students for es- corting non-college girls to school functions, lived up to its promise ta be bigger and better this year, ac- cording to a United Press dispatch. Despite protests of the youths that with two ""di.scipline"" dances they had been punished sufficiently, the girls of the college went ahead with plans for the affair which was held"
Wednesday,evening.
The,"""war"" between the sexes at the college took a different turn thi.s year."
When,"male students voiced their protests at the ""manles.s"" dances, the co-eds retaliated by in- sisting on having a girl cheer leader. Miss Kathryn Magolotti, of Ma.son- town,"
was,"electe<l to represent the girls before the cheering sections af- ter the feminine students refused to cheer under male guidance. More than one campus romance has been shattered by the strange e<lict and the walks about the college grounds, ideal ""lovers lanes,"" are almost deserted."
The,"girls asserted their independ- ence at the first ""manless"" dance two years ago. Last year the second was held and both were pronounced suc- cesses. The thini exceeded the pre- ceding functions in brilliance, accord- ing to the girls. .Miscellany Half the world does not"

E.,"Thelss, professor of journalism, pave the students of the I^wisburff hijfh school .'fome definite suggestions concerning literary work, in a talk to the entire student body at the high school chapel exercises last"
Monday,morning.
A,"week previously Professor Theiss had talked to the same audience about Uncle Sam's dirigibles, the Los Angeles and the ill-fated Shenan- doah. In that talk he described the"
work,"of constructing a dirigible, and told .something about the various ma- terials that go into the making of a lighter-than-air flying craft."
Making,"use of the background he had created in his first talk, Dr. Theiss described the (liferent sorts of material that go into the making of a book, such as characters, inci- dents, setting, and other items. Then he showed the students"
how,"to get these materials. Camera is Useful Settings can often be recorded by the camera, and where it is possible to bring"
home,"material in the form of photographs, .such pictures are useful in refreshing the memory."
A,few photographs will do what
many,pages of notes might not do any bet- ter or as well. Facts can be secured and recorded ea.sily. They should be jotted
down,"while .still very fresh in the memory. Probably the most difficult ma- terial to as.semble, said Professor Thei.ss, is that which consists of in- cidents and characters. Real hap- penings, though not always used lit- trally, prove most helpful to an au- thor in what they suggest. But be- fore a writer can secure material of this sort, he must first win the con- fidence and good will of those from"
whom,"he hopes to get his material,"
and,he mu.st use tact and discretion In his efforts to
draw,people out. Probably the be.st
way,"to accomplish this, he said, is to feel and show a genuine interest in what each per.son is doing. rharacters Hard to Find Characters are even mon- difficult to find. Just as real occurrences"

In this connection, Dr. Theiss called attention to the death, a few days ago, of the southern mountaineer"
who,suggestofl to John
Fox,"Jr., the principal character in his ""Trail of the Ivonesome Pine."" Should Study People The best"
way,"to get convincing characters, the speaker .said, is to study people, to v/aU-h their action.^, to listen to them talk, and to try to get at the mainsprings of their ac- tions. Inevitably, in studying a given field and the persons in that field, the writer comes acro.ss persons of di- verge temperament and"
varying,"habits of action,"
who,"sujirge.st char- acters that ""bebmg"" to the story. ""Perhaps nothing Is of greater u.se to a writer than a pleasing person- ality,"" said Dr. Thei.ss. ""If you can"
make,"people respect you and have confidence in you and like you, they will go out of their"
way,to .serve you. .A.n<l if you don't
know,
how,"to culti- vate a pleasing personality, I might suggest that honesty, sincerity, sim- plicity, and friendline.ss are basic. F^ch is a simple virtue, and easy to cultivate. But when you get all the.-e (lualities combine<i in one character, you have a mighty fine character, and one that will take you a long way. If you want to succeed as a writer, or grocer, or a business man, or in any other field, you will find -that a pleas- ing porsonaiity is of the greatest help to you."""
By,Harold F^ Mitchell Someone has estimated that the annual cost of unnecessary noise is greater than the yearly losses to the nation from fire. This fact immedi- ately conveys to our minds the need for making some drastic changes concerning the uncontrolled din that is running up business costs and in- juring health. In
many,places the present bed- lam of sound has reached a point where the
human,nervous system is hmling it extremely difficult to bear up under such a continuous .strain.
Many,corporations and other places of business often find a decided in- crease in their liabilities and are at a loss to
know,"where the blame should be placed. Without a doubt, a large portion of this deficit might be attributed to lo.ss of efficiency <iue to unnecessary noi.ses, which"
make,"concentration difficult and hampers important work. For a long iime, the nuisance of noise has been treated as a joke, but city people,"
who,"have had thrust upon them the fact that the inter- ludes of silence are becoming fewer and farther between, are commenc- ing to rebel."
They,have found it im- possible to get
away,"from riveting machines, automobile horns, street cars, and the roar of machinery of one type or another. P'or this very reason a"
new,"type of pnjfession is becoming popular, mainly that of*de- vising of ways and means whereby the.se ""devils of din"""
may,be elimi- nated. Direct
War,".Against Noise Today, the war against such noises is being directed by trained technical minds which understand the serious mental and physical defects resulting from conditions whi(h permit soumi waves to beat conlinvously against the ear, draining the nervous energy, confusing the brain and reducing the accuracy and quality of work. It .seems strange that the ear Is the only organ of sense which has no legal protection, and yet .such is the truth. The law forbids offensive odors, protects vision, etc. But the ear, which is the .shortest avenue to the brain, -is unable to attain immun- ity from sounds. Perhaps .some of the most serious and universal effects of noisp Is the effect It has upon the individual"
who,"is trying to get a (focnl night's rest. Reports of physicians tell us that every sound that is registered in the brain effects the body. Outside noise which enters a sleeping room with- out awiikeiiing occupants, not only"

GAME,"increases muscular tension,"
but,"rai.ses the blood pressure of the >leeper nearly to the waking level. To gain a more local aspect of this, let us consiiler for the"
moment,"a fraternity hou.se. During the day there are numerc^us things being done which, although not really harmful, tend to detract from one's ability to apply one's .self to the utmost"
when,an attempt is be- ing
made,to study.
Many,of these could be eliminated providing the in- dividuals
who,are the offenders woulfi be a little more thoughtful. But one cannot expect too
much,from a group of approximately thirty young
men,
who,have much of their time to do with as they plea.se.
To,"go to sleep in a fraternity hou.se or dormitory is also another problem, for it is seldom that there is not a ""bull session"" or radio going at full blast. The fraternities"
make,"such legislation as should properly govern their respective noise problems, but to enforce these rules is another mat- ter entirely. The chairman of the house committee is usually the one delegated to see that tjuiet hour is properly enforced but his attempts are"
frecjuently,"accompanied by ""birdies"" from the intelligentsia,"
who,"have, or better, yiink they have de- voted sufficient time to their studies. To -stop noise in a fraternity house is a man-sized job, but it must be re- membered that not aB noises effect different individuals in the same way. Conducive to Slumber"
Some,"noises, such as soft music or the breaking of surf upon the shore are especially conducive to sound slumber. In order to"
make,"a practical ap- plication of the principle of sound quieting, the modern acoustical engi- neer not only keeps in mind the type of noise, but he must understand"
human,physiology and psychology. He must U-ar in mind that fre(|uent- ly it is not the intensity of a noise that is so disturbing as it is the sig- nificance it has on the in<lividual. With a
new,"semester just starting, it will be well for all students to iso- late themselves as"
much,as possible from the outside world so as to get off to a gowl .start.
A,word to the wise should be sufficient .
We,have all recently experienced the need to study hard' for the first .semester final exams.
We,can recall sharply what a difference it
made,"to us when the house was really quiet, and"
how,much more efficiently
we,.studied undi-r those conditions. Motion pictures of the Bucknell- Penn State football

way,"is the best way. But let Bucknell begin the step soon, so that she does not have to"
make,the radi- cal change Penn found neces.sary.

FAVORITE,"""That the best things of life are not passed from one generation to another by formal teaching, but are pa.ssed by contagion,"" was the theme of the lecture, ""Contagion of Life,"" delivered by Dr."
H.,"T. Colestock at Bellefonte, January 29, before the Convention of Directors of Center County. ""Contagion is usually looked at as , '4u II- I '^ 1^ "" .something undesirable,"" said Dr. from the Kigueda, generally consid- j Colestock, ""because"
we,"think of it ored the mo.st important of the along abnormal lines, but looking at _ I it on the other side,"
we,.<<ee it as one *
*,"I J f,f ^),p niost beneficient factors in life."
The,"abnormality of it is only a drop in the bucket as compared to the normality. I ""One of the be.st hopes of the race i i.s this contagion of life. But just I what does this"
mean?,"It means that education, formal education, cannot pass on"
many,"of the most valuable things that life has to give, that there are"
many,things that
we,"can- not get by books, and that these things are learned by contagion. ""This contagion of life is a method by which some of these things are pas.sed on to the"
human,"race. First of all, there are manners. Manners are the lubricant to .society, the oil to your motor, and one of the finest assets to life. .And manners are learned by contagion. Morals Transformed ""An<l then there are morals."
How,[ incomplete morals are in books if
we,"can't have honor, truthfulness, loyal- ty, or patriotism in everyday life? These are all tran.sforme<l from one life to the next by contagion, as are"

The training course, leading to the scouter's key, the equivalent of the Kagle rank, will be comprised of a series of two hour .se.sslons, the la.st in each season in the out-of-doors. The cost of enrollment in the course will be one dollar and fifty cents. The fir.st course will include the fundamentalls of scoutma.stership. Beginning with troop organization and the patrol system, the student .scouters, under Mr. Hosterman, will learn the essentials of the .scouting program from the tenderfoot re- quirements to the work of the first class .scouts. The work of the .second cour.se will consist of more intensive"
work,"in nature .study, .signalling, first aid, and"

When,the Inter-collegiate Boxing Rules Committee met last week they
made,the most drastic changes ever
made,.since the introduction of the manly art of self-defense into the college realm.
The,"three principal changes were: The elimination of judges, giving the referee sole power to decide the win- ner of the bout. The fighters"
may,take this out of the referee's power hv knocking their
man,out. The elimination of the extra round was another important change. The third was Uie reduction of the entrants into the Inter-collegiate Champion- ships to five schools. Un<ler the
new,"rules the referee makes all decisions and decides the winner. There are no extra roumls, the l)out being declared a draw, if, at the end of the three rounds, there is no choice between the men. In this ca.se the points are split up be- tween the two teams. There are to be no more invited teams in the In- ter-collegiate Championships."

game,"of the sea- son with Blue Ridge College, out of a total of 51 for their team. The work of Wellinger and Clar\ at the guard positions is very nearly air- tight. Coach Stahley has several goo<l"
men,to back uo his first-string lineup. Coach John Plant will send hl3
men,"on the floor with only two prac- tices of not more than an hour each. Even under this handicap the Bisons will put on a betU>r show than the last affair with Colgate, since the un- sf'ttiedness of examination week and registration will be a thing forgot- ten. Smith is .steadily improving in foot"

Bream,and his Gettysburg Battlefielders will furnish the opposi- tion for the Bucknell court team on Saturday night at the Lewisburg gym.
The,Bisons will be somewhat ham- pered in this encounter through a lack of practice and the fact that Western Maryland is
met,"on Friday. There has been no time during the last two weeks when the entire squad has been as.sembled for a workout. Last week examinations conflicted and this week registration and en- rolment played havoc with the prac- tice sessions. Gettysburg has the usual good team which they put on the floor each year, and a fast"
game,"is antici- pate<l. Both teams have jrames on the debit side of the ledger, but each is on the upgrade Bucknell should be at full strength, as Hepler has had an opportunity to give his m- jured knee a rest, and all the rest of the"
men,are in good shape.
A,"win over Gettysburg will be greatly appreciated by the student body, as Gettysburg has had a habit of being rather troublesome to Buck- nell basketball teams in the past few- years. Chenoweth."

STARS,Colgate University ran around Bucknell in a rather slow basketball
game,"Friday night in the high school gymnasium,' winning by a .score of 37-26. Nichols tallied 12 points for the visitors while his teammate, .Ander- son, collected 10. Captain Koss"
wa>,"outstanding on the Bison aggrega- tion, piling up five field goals for a total of 10 points. Colgate got the"
jump,on Bucknell from the start and had annexed a total of 18 points to Bucknell's one in the first twenty minutes.
The,"Bisons then began to pUiy better ball and by half time had brought the gap down to 10 points, scoring 12 points to their, opponents five."
The,.second frame
was,"more even, Buck- nell getting 13 points to Colgate's 14, and the"
game,"ended, 37-26. Gets Ball Bucknell got the first tip-off but lost the ball."
When,"it was regained in a few moments, Hepler and Cheno- weth both missed tries. Orsi scored the fir.st points, making two foul shots good. Smith then found the net for one point before Colgate grabbed the ball and started her bar- rage on the Bi.son goal. Nichols and Anderson led the scoring attempts at this time and in twenty minutes had run up a 17 point lead. Ross then went in on a counter attack and garnered eight points in the next t<<n minutes. At the half the totals stood 23-13."

worked,smoothly and held on to the ball a great<<i' part of the time.

named,as there are too
many,team.s tied for the top berths in each league. In League One the out.standing teams are Theta Upsilon
Ome^a,and the
Campus,Club. The
game,between these two teams
was,a thriller with the T. U. O. ag- gregation finally coming through to win by the narrow margin of two points. The
Campus,Club five was hampered by a lack of reserve ma- terial. League II is equally scrambled with the
Sigma,"Chi and Sigma Alpha Ep- silon teams contending for the domi- nance of that circuit. The ""Sig"" team took the Delta"
Kappa,Phi team into
camp,"with ease, scoring almost at will when the first team was in the game. The S. A. E.'s had an e<|ually easy time in disposing of the Alpha rhi Delta representatives. There are four teams in each league which have"
won,and four that have l)een defeated. This gives the dopester little to go on in picking the leaders. The competition is very keen in all ca.^es and the sea.son should fiiselose .some very interesting encounters. Following are the league stand- ings: League I

A,.surpri.ee awaited the students
who,"line<i up before the door of the Recorder's office, Tue.sday, in quest of last semester's gra<<les. Instead of the usual pocket-sized report, they were handed a large tinted sheet >*'ith an all-inclusive grade record upon it. Registrar"
H.,
W.,Holter explainejl ttet this
new,"system of recording student curricular activity had been adopte<i from the plan as it is being practiced at other colleges. .Since Bucknell has not yet installed means for making the sheet.** by the Ozoalid method, tho.se di.stributcnl this week were made at Penn State, where the method has recently been establish- ed. The reports of all students, grade> covering their entire .stay in college, have already been sent to the vari- ous home>. This has been done in an effort to acquaint both the parent and student with actual collegiate standing 'f the individual. Dean J. Hillis Miller will give a t;dk in freshman chapel"
tomonow,"morning on ""Life Purpo.se."" In his lecture he will emphasize three points: that ^nc must find a life pur- pose, that one must foster it. and finally, that one must guard it. Professor P. L. Harrlman, head of the department of psychology, will"
taU,"to the freshmen at Tues<<iay's chapel period on ""The Origin of Col- lege Degrees."""
He,"will di.scuss th:? u.*e of the college degree from the middle ages to modern times, touch- ing upon the origin of the ae.idemic degree. In ad<lition, he will consider the early st-atus of the Bachelor of .Arts ilegree, and th<<' .significance <<)f degree.s as repi-esentlng a departure from medieval customs in the univer- sities oi EXirope. In"
many,"of the Euroix-an univer- sities, according to Profes.sor Harri- man, the .Masters degree stands for little more than the .\. B. degree in this country."

much,"justice as they have with previous produc- tions. ""Captain .\pplejack"" was given last year and .scored a huge success. These annual presentations of the local fratemity have become an in- ^ stitution on the campus largely be- cause of the acting ability of the ca.sts, and because of the arrange- ment of the settings.

W.,"Gates, the topic for con- sideration will be ""The Causes and Consequences of the Current Eco- nomic Depression."" David Davis. '32, is to preside, and George Aber- nethy, '32, will be the speaker. The Forum, .according to Professor Gates, faculty advisor of the club, ""has a dual role to perfomv; first, that of an international relations club and second, that of a liberal club. These clubs generally have separate organizations but it"
was,"thought best to combine them at Buckmdl for a time in order to avoid too much duplication and to enable all persons interested to attend."" Tlie purpose of the"
Forum,"is to study :5omo of the more pre.<<;Ring problems of the day such as the causes and consequences of the cur- rent economic depression, the racial minorities In Central Europe. Euro- pean dictatorships, the American policy of recognition toward revolu- tionary governments in Latin .\meri- rn. lindtation of armaments, recent tariff legislation, the unemployment problem, and similar questions."

new,"dormitory. Miss Hlavaty, ol"
whom,"Bucknell- ians had i)reviously been afforde<<l only inadetiuate <<:i>>mpses, showed herself to hv possessor of that qual- ity of touch, and of color free"
from,"mere nu-cluinical skill, which distin- }juishe> the pianist from the piano player. Her numbers were of romantic eharaclei, compositions which only a pianist of Miss Hlavaty's ability"
may,render with succes.-^.

and,"arn.nged by Bruhm.-,, was the opening .selection."
Two,"contemporary numbers. ""White Peacock"" by C.ritfes and ""Island Spell"" by Ireland, were well de.<5ijrTied to show the talent of th<<- artist.

won,the prolonged ap- plause of her hearers.
Her,"response A-a.s another of Chopin's l)eautiful compositions, ""Nocturne in F-.sharp major."" While the auditor miprht well have wi.shed for Mu<s Hlavaty's ren.lition of one of the classical masterpieces, the n-cital in its romantic unity wan ondoubtedly well designetl to show iho pianistic ability of the artist."
Her,"choice of numbers showed a fine ap- preciation of romantic literature 3n<; .->>f propram balame. ChanKe in rrouroni Albert Weitlens.iul's substitution of Franz Schubert's ""Der Wanderer"" for the Gounod aria, ""Avant de quit- ter ces lioux"" decidedly improved the progri-ani, in replacing it with one of the linest works of all ""I.ieder"" lit- erature. The beautiful lyric i|uali- tie.s of Mr. WeiA'nsaul'^ voice are well"
known,"to the I^ewisburK .ludi- i-nce. Of le.s.scr significance were the lyric.^ of his .second appearance on *he program. Mr.-. Vera MiRCr>>adi>>- showed, without the tendency to"
come,"into the foreground which distinguishes the ! inexperienced accompanist, her pian- istic ability. Her accompaniment blended beautifully with the voic<<' of the soloist. John V. I.esher, '^7,"

game,"with Western Mary- l;;nd la.^t Friday nigljt. Chenoweth was ""on,"" and that made a big difference. In the last two games ""Steam"" had been off on hi.- marksmanship, but against the Western Maryland aggregation he sudilenly got the range in the second iialf and reeled off four spectaiular baskets to provide the Bisons with their winning margin. At no time during the encounter was the .scoro at a variance of more than five points. Bucknell jumped off to an early load, and after five minutes of play, led by four points. Tills was due chiefly to the work of Hepler,"
who,dropped in a pair of field goals shortly after the first toss-ui>>. Western .Maryland came light Ijark and whittled the lead
down,"until things stood even once more. Not content with this revival, the yellow-shirted visitors took the baci and maintained it throuirhout the remaimler of the half, the score at the end of the first canto being, lit- 1.5.

pym,on Tuesday night. The fii-st t:ame. scheduled for February 17. will fStarl at 7:1.5.
Due,to the fact that the
gym,"is available only on Tuesday nights, there will be three games played -very Tuesday until the spring va- cation. It i- thought that enough game.-^ will be either forfeiU'd or"
moved,up to permit the playing ol the semi-finals before F^.ster.
AW,teams int^-nding to forfeit game** must notify Miss Melchor on the day before the'
game,"is scheduled. As the .""schedule"
now,stands the tinals and semi-finals will be played as early as pos.^ible in .^pril. In the Msmi-fmals. the two leading teams in i one league will compete with the two j heading teams in the other.
The,two leagues which opposed i 4.ach other last year have U-en slight- ly roanangcd and have receivtMl two j

He,has conducted a .series of experiments with
com,"in order to study its inheritance, and recently has published a scientific treatise on *'Vivipary in Maize."" This article treats of the genns in the .seeds of"

Omar,
Khayyam,"will be the subject of Mis.s Lois .\. Stevcn.<<on's lecture tonight, the third of tht World Literature course this semester. The philosophy of"
Omar,
Khayyam,first received its vojjue from the tran.slation of Fitzgerald. Undoubt- edly the
poem,"gaine<l much through his interpretation. .\s a student of languages, and Oriental languages in particular, Fitzgerald came across the almost cnidf original form of the |)oem. Seeing its possibilities, he worked long and earnestly over the ""Qua- trains,"" which is the meaning of the word ""Rubaiyat."""
As,"a result, his careful translati(m, his poli.shing of ItF phra.ses, and his interpretation of its philosor)hy are so markedly su- ptrior to the Persian version as U>"
make,it almo.st his
own,poem.
The,
poem,"expres.ses IwautifuUy the purely Oriental philosophy of ""eat, drink, and be merry, for tomor- row"
we,"<lie."" That philosophy, which gaine<<l popularity with a certain group, and the sheer beauty of the' phrasing of the quatrains have made the"
poem,"most valuable in English literature. Fitzgerald's lalwis wire not com- plete<l. There are almo.st a thousand quatrains in the original, and he was able to translate only a few h'lii- dred of them. Saturday. February 21 | 12:30-- .Mu-ical program f r o"

At,"tomorrow's meeting of the stu- dent'.- Religions .Seminar, a profes- .sor. whose"
name,"is being withheld, will speak on ""Discrimination."" -At the meeting last week, Robert E. Page, assistant profes.sor of political science and -^ociologj', spoke on the ""Background of Prejudice."" The talk ami discu.ssion centered! around the development of ran .-. the anthropometrie criterion for classifi- cation of races, and the influence of environment upon prejudice. Members of the .semmar are read- i;ig various artticles on ""Prejudice,' and in this"
way,"are obtaining a ba-is for discussion. ""Eddie"" Halicki, well-known Buck nell athlete, has returned to Bucknell to complete his work, after an ab- sence of almost two years."
Upon,"leaving Bucknell, Halicki continued to play football and ba.se- ball. During the .seasons of 1929 and 1930 he was a"
member,of the Frankford Yellowjackets
footbal,"team, which was a"
member,"of the Professional Football League. In season. ""Eddie"" pitched for the Blue Riilge League team in Wayneslwn). While in school, ""Eddie"" wa.^"
known,as the
"""Man","in the Iron .Ma^k,"" due to the special protective devise he wore over his face during the grid campaign. Thi.s handicap did not prevent him from becoming one of the i)Ut.<<tanding figoires in j Bucknell sport history. .At this time Halicki has returned to get a few credits which are neces- .sary for his graduation. He expects j to have enough hours to be graduate i | with the clajv- this June. j It |ja\-s to advertise.

now,in the hands of Dr. F.

among,education students.
The,"booklet, whicli is bound in aii. attractive light blue paper cover, contains all the speeches"
made,"at the general sessions held Friday after- noon and evening of October 31 at Bucknell Hall, and those"
made,at the .sectional meetings the following morning. The main speakers of this year'c conference were
Max,"McConn, deari of I.*;high University, and William"
W.,"McClelland, professor of educa- tion and director of the Training College, at St. .Andrews University. Scotland. Dean .McConn's contribu- tion to the general subject of the conference, ""creative education"" were two characteristically good add resse--, ""Is The .American Arts College an Anachronism?"" and ""Democracy and Higher Education."" Profes.sor Mc- Clelland brought the Scottish view of the subject on ""Creative FMucatior and The Teacher Student."" anc ""Changing Values in E<<lucation."" Dr. Davis hopes that Bucknell'.- next education conference, which ha.s been planned for October 23 ami 24 of next fall, will bring as prominen* speakers to the campus as its las', one.

AMONG,
THE,
BOOK,
STALLS,"Grand Hotel i.- a title which is known to theatre-goers and book readers alike, for the book, as well as a play adapted from it, are"
now,cur- rent. Originally it was written in
German,by Vicki
"Baum,",
who,gathered the material for her novel while working as chambermaid in a large
German,hotel. Her char- acters are those which might be found at any fashinoable iiostelry in Europe. Their lives intertwine to produce an exciting melodrama. Miss
Baum,"has told her story a.* one would tell of a trip at its com- pletion, .-^nd she tells it with such straightforwardness, that her hotel visitors take"
real,"proportions. Most particularly will the reader remember Kringelein, the sickly, ovtrworked bookkee|)er,"
who,"is tasting life on his savings, and Flainmchen, the lovely stenograph- er,"
who,"satisfies the desire of the pitiable Kringelein. The publisli- iiig of the book at this time affords an unusual chance to its readers, in that they"
may,vivify the story by taking in the dramatization in
New,"York. Boners, by those"
who,"ma<<le them, is a book for the moment, but a mo- ment filled with uncontrollable ^ laughter. Teachers here a n d | abioad have gathered together a i lot of misinformation which school- boys have seriously recorded on j twt papers and such; a few illus- ^ trations have been drawn to amuse , those who couldn't read, and as a result we have a volume which I iihould prove interesting to colUg- ] ians. I"
Some,of the prize boners are: ; Solomon had 300 wives and 700 i porcupines; an epistle is the wife of an apostle; the Acropolis was I the .she-wolf that nursed
Romeo,"| and Juliet, and .so on. .Sealed Mysteries is one of the clever- j est advertising plans ever invented by a publishing house. For two years Harper's have been guaran- teeing money back if their myster- ies are not satisfactory to the reader."
A,"seal is placed over the last portion of the book. If you can keep from breaking the seal to find out what happens next, you get your"
money,back. The latest plav- <lining

way,of .i little side show sell some .station- ery supplies.
We,have a couple of tenants
--,probably a reprehensible act on our part
--,
who,choose to run a barber shop and a t.iilor shop. To covet desirable tenants is the unpardonable -in of real estate dealers.
How,much mouoi>oly <<lo
we,enjoy? We'll tell you.
We,hiliev. in frankness even if it huits.
We,have three dormitories where for several hour* a day wt draw our main business.
We,invite the
Com-,merce and Kinanct Department to
come,up some day if they want to =He business that's gone over with a fine tooth comb. Almost every fuior has its
own,"canteen. That's only a begipiJwT- Every third guy of the hifl is agent foi some merchandise, mostly branches from"
down,town. Student tailors and h:irbers are continually going and coining.
Some,"of Prof. Hunnn-'s chamhermalds play wtt nurse by selling milk, others take in waj^hing and"
manage,canteens. Like the ftllow
who,"swallowed a watch, they're tryinir to pass the time aw.iy. But veu ain't seen nothiijg yet: Wait till tiie shade- of ni^'ht brim; the basket parade from all <iuarters of Lewisburg. apple vender . .^antlwich venders, ice cream vender.-, coffee venders, and candy kid ad intinitum. We're .supposed to prosper on what is left. It .seems to uk the picture isn't quite complete yet. .Might w. i.ot suggest that the main entrance t)f the"
Commerce,Departnieii -hould b<> i)ainted a bright reo in honor of their chief apostle of chai-i stoi<<' propaganda.
As,"an incentive to honor students in Bucknell' Business College, there is .<<till the first floor of Old Main where thi cry of the hawker has not di.-.tiirhed the classical atmosphere. The; should be given the concessions that we connote with the Hectm Street Eords."
A,nice long pus>>hmobilo overflowing with bananas arci a-sorted fruits would be one of the finishing touches to this pictui- just inside the entrance.
A,"peanut roaster hy the Registrar's oHic would catch a lot of business. The finishing touch would be a dainl.. maid, her tray loaded with Luckie.^ and Camels, hovering near"
wheK,"t1-,e faculty is wont to loiter."
From,this we can gather that th germinal seed of the
Commerce,"and Finance Department has brouir!i' forth a hundre<<l fold. In other words, Bucknefl is a home for Chrisi ian education"
--,"that is. what can l>e squeezeti in between peddlers aivi agents. Did .""^omeoiie say that the Dean opposed"
W.IBU,because o' its commercial features? Wouldn't it be a shame? So unlike th- lest of the institution. In discouraging mooils
we,have often regretted that
we,enlarii^i the Inn. Experience has fully persuaded us that the student ho- 1. favors a multitude of road house stands on the campus rather than more pretention- place. They wouldn't want a
new,Hotel for Lewi burg. They would take the
Cameron,"House,"
The,"cream of thei: bu.siness is goinjr to support mediocre joints. Monopoly, did you say ' Of course, hut its only the skim milk variety, about enough to ke< afloat."
We,wonder if our critics have surveyed the enii)ryo
Wanamakci,
down,town. Have they ever heard of a shoe shine parlor that sei!
new,"suits, dry cleans and pres.ses, sells soft drinks, candy, tobact > nnil pop coi-n? Do they"
know,"of a soda fountain that don't include fiairp of children's. There were llOJ^ lunch and magaeines? Di<l they ever hear of a combination mea, women's undergarments. 78 dres.ses,|^ and grocery storey hardware stores that sell electrical goods and plumbing; clothinjr .storet* that sell shoes, a sporting goods store that almost rivals Heine's variety?"
What,about National Banks witli trust p<<wrer.<>>? Drujr stores that handle everything but drugs. \\ * even know an undertaker and gas
man,
who,"warble on Sunday, Quit r. few, it .seems,"
who,don't put all their eggs in one basket. For which
we,"offer no criticism^ just an alibi for ourselves. Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter, whence come, this criticism? Probably frohi some one"
whom,
we,beat to town about fifteefi years. Or perhaps .some native is sore because .i .'tranger came in and discovered acres of diamonds in his town that he overlooked.

A,colorful note wa^ added to the throng Df spectators .lue to the presence of
many,"person.^ in evening clothes. \11 ..f ihe bouts were interestmg. and for the most part very evenly >>onte..ted. In the one-fifteen pound -las<<, Terpolilli came through with one of the best e.vhibitions of boxintr which he ha.-* treated the fans to"
m,"Tiis three year.^ of competition. Bo^rner l,ost'<< ""Micky'' Boerner met one of th'- oe<t one hundred and twenty-five pound boxers in amateur competition. Di Pasquali"
won,"a <lecision from *Bat"" Battleino,"
who,is
now,"world s champion in his weight. During the first two r..und.- <.f the fight, Boerner 'ooked very g<iod, carrying the fii>t nnd getting at lea.^t a draw out of the second. In the third canto Di Pa.*- quali landed numerous hard rights *o the head which did not <<io Boerner any troo<l. It wa.<< this .strong finish :n the third round which enabled the Catholic"
U.,fighter to get the nod. Captiiin Marche.-^ano did a bu.M- ness-like job in disposing of Di Gia- como.
whom,"he defeated last year, as well as on .Saturday night. ""Marchy wa.'>> not in top form, and it was ap- parent that he was tiring during the . closing round. The Catholic Universitj one-foityj pounder drew with Bienus of Buck- nell"
The,"affair wa.s very closely contested, and Bienus could have jnit the bout under his belt if he had been a little more ageressive during th"" final round. Blasi's Kxperience Helps i CapU.in Bla.-i, an experienced ling- man, had little trouble in taking the lecisicm from Kubacki, a newcomer"
m,the Bison mi^ team. Kubacki was
game,"and put up a very good fight *""or his initial appearance in the rin-. In one of the best fights of the eve- ning"
"""Xorm""","Egel be.sted ""Jimmie Lyons in the light-heavy cla.ss. Kgel nas been showing marked improve-"

m,*he onlv knockout on the program. Pyne
was,just a little bit too good for Russo
who,was fighting out of his cla^s by almf)st two .iivi.sions.
The,knockout came shortly after the bell for the second round had loing. Rus- so crossed the ring and met Pyne as he camo out of his corner. The blow which dropped the Bison contender
was,a hard right to the head.

W.,
&,J. basket- ball team met a
much,impr.)ved Bi.son (luintette and went
home,"on the short Pnd of a 2<? to 19 .<<corc, after a rough and poorly-played"
game,"last Thurs- dav night at the I.-wisburu: g\mi. The Bi-ons jumped oft' to an early U-ad and were ahead at ..11 stages of tiu> game. The scon- at half time V as 13 to 'J, but with the advent of the second seme.ster Was. and .leff. took a turn for the better, and pulled up to within two points of BuckneU."
M,this time the
game,"got somewhat out of th"" han.ls of the ofiicials ami became a rather rouxh an.l tumble affair. Captain Ro.-s and ""Bill Smith were <<m the flo.>>r innumerabl- limes, and little good basketball was played. K<<mhs Ik .Vccurate"
The,"absence of Chenoweth was compensated for by the accurate marksmanship of Ross. The ""Glou- ce.sterman"" had a large evening sink- ing three goals ami netting thrt-e fouls for a total of nine points. Hep- lei slipped four double pointer- through the hoop to take second scor- ing h.mors for the locals, i^ft for- ward Joy of"
W.,
&,"J., turned in the largest total for the losers with ten points."
He,scored three goals in rr.pid succession .shortly after the be- ginning of the la>t period.
W.,".S: J. Joy, f Hamilton, f ..; Smith, f Butler, c Martin, <<* McNeill, g Johnsem. g ShatTer, g Totals Bucknell boxer of their .showing University Saturday, ought to defeat Cornell, a new roiiu-r on th<< Bucknell .schedule. One of the big surprises of the .sea- son is the tremendous improvement of Terpolilli, the Bison mite. Again.st, his C."
U.,"opponent, ""Trip"" displayed such an unorthodox style of boxing that his opponent"
was,"greatly over- whelmed and decisively beaten by a barrage of punches, which landed while ""Trip"" worked his"
way,"in, out, and around the defense of his be- wildered opponent."
He,"has develop- ed .such a deceptive .style that he ought to baffle any of his future op- jionents, and should become a main- stay on this year's team, if his la.st week's performance is to lu* ctmsider- ed as a criterion. ""Mickey"" Boerner, according to hK- ' showing against Di Pas<iuale, C."
U.,"1 ace, and one of the best feather- : weights in collegiate circles, should win at C.inell in a rather decisive fashion. Is .Sure Winner Captain Marchesano, one of the i cleverest and speediest boxers .-ver i developed at Bucknell, and one of the best inter-collegiate light-weights in ! the country, should be a .sure winner at Comtdl ami a good bet against any I <<)f his coming opponents. Although "".*tan"" Bienus is some- what inexperienced, he is a .sturdy ' and rugged fighter; he ought to give a irood account of him.self against ' the Cornell 14.')-pounder,"
who,"is also .somewhat handicapped by lack of ex- 1 perience, but"
who,"is a willing mixer. One of the best examples of grit ami i-ourage was displayed la.st week v.hen ""Lou"" Russo. (me of the stiflFest punchers in his weight, voluntarily ' assented to fight in the unlimitinl cla.ss, thirty-five pounds above his ; natural fighting weight. ""Ixm"" was ' a victim of hard luck in his tussle heavier opponent in the first round, Russo was knocked out by a ""fluke liaymaker"" in the second round. This wefck Hius^o will fight in the 155- pound class, and he is expected to defeat his"
man,"by the decision or knockout route. Willing To Fight Kubacki, although ""green"" in the art of .self-defense, lias displaye<l his willingness to fight and by gradually improving his offensive attacks, should give the rest of his opponents plentv to worry about. I.a.st week, as expected, ""Norin"" Kgcl easily defeated the C."
U.,en- trant. Egel has shown a tremend- ous improvement in his daily
"""gym""","workouts; but in his first ring en- icagement of this season he did not look as well as in <laily training. Probably, this"
was,"due to ""Norm's"" ffieat sportsman.shii) and the weak- ness of his opponent,"
who,"was un- able to extend him to the limit, a c<mdition in which Kgel is always at his best. However, I pick him to be a winner at Cornell. Cornell will not be represented in the lT."")-pound class, but will have an entrant in the ir).')-pound class, in which weight ""Lou"" Russo will se.> action. Although ""Otty"" Neid ha-- not yet fought, he has possibilities of ht-coiiiing a good prospect for the luavy weight class; and after .several werks of coaching in the fine points of t!i<' game, he should be a consist-"
cm,"winner. ""Otty"" poses.se.s unusual -ir.nKth and stamina, plus ""dyna- mite"" in either hand. He should be ablf to u.se the.se qualifications to his (,wii advantage and to his opponent's disadvantage. j;illt""r'i<< Ni.li-- TliU li>> 111.'

LAFAYETTE,"(jn .Monday the ba.sketball team goes to Penn State, where the weak- cr-than-usual State team will be met. pt-nn State has had a very poor season, with the results of the ma- jority of their Kame.-r located on the red .side of the ledger. Lafayette beat the Lion the night before Buck- nell def>>'ated Ufayette. There is one factor that must be taken into consideration, and that i- the fact that Penn State is alway> a dangerou.^ rival for Bison teams."
The,relative strength of the teiims!_ on paper is never any criteri>>n as to the sort of an encounter that will take place. The
games,"are always goo<l. Bucknell will go to State with only a single <iay'.s rest after the Albriglil game, which is a disadvantage, as"

ART,".Appearing in the dual role of a lecturer and reproducer of music Percy Grainger, the greatest charac- ter"
who,"has as vet n.-^en from the great country of .\ustralia, revealed him.-self a.-* the .synthesi.st, the com- poi'er, Tue.s<tay evening, in thi' final presentation of the Entertainmen Course. Playing and lecturing before the large.st audience of the season, the Hole mu.sical off f ring of the entire course, the artist presented his con- ceptions of composeis ami composi- tions of various musical epochs. Hi* musical philosophy was built about a tripod of which the feet were the melo<lic songs of the tribal gather- irg.s, the polyphony of Bach ami hi< rontemporarie.-, and the homophony of his successors. It is interesting to note, that in the present trend upward to Bach, Grainger used the work of this Ba- lock master as the keyst>>ne of his Hi.seu.ssion, comparing or eontra.sting the music of other periods with the polyphonic works of the gient Thur- ingian. I*lays Bach Fugues Building up to Bach through ""folk"" and ""popular"" melodie.<<, the opening of the concert really came with the presentation of the lively ""Fugue in"
A,"Minor."" In this and in the fugue which followed it, Grainger .showed his remarkable talent as an instru- mentalist, reaching in his playing a point so near to the ch.Tracteristics of the harpskhord, for which the compositi<ms were written, that one could scarcely realize that the same instrument was to be used in the colorful romantic numbers that were to follow. Quite unlike the first fu<<ue was the .sedate, ""Fugue In"
C,"sharp minor,"" unquestionably one of the very highe.st peaks in all the realm of music."
We,"regret, indeed, that Mr. Grainger did not include the sublime Prelude to the fugue in his program. Tt was in the fugues, taken froni the ""Well-tempered Clavier, Book 1,"" rather than in his rendition of the aria. ""Sheep"
may,"graze In safety,"" that the pianist .showed himself a masterful interpreter of the Zopf composer. In them he left no doubt af to his thorough comprehension of the spirit of the Barock, and of a niee appreciation of the polyphony of (Continued on la?t page) Three committees were appointed by the student comini-ssicn for the revision of women's rules at their first meeting held last night in the library of the new dormitory.

Women's,"Col- lege dining room, to plan for the con- ference next fall. .A constructive pnigram was out- lined, which revised the Saturday morning meetings of the conference, by the addition of one hour. Gen- eral session.*; with an outstanding speaker will .be held between 11:00 and 12:00 a. m.

New,"York, and the American public off its feet had to fight for life two years ago."
A,"small company of London actors, on the point of di.sbanding because they could not get an opjKirtunity to pre.sent their play. ""Journey's End."" has since .seen the English-speaking world emotionalized Wfore its ter- rible truth. Sheriff's i)lay started its great career"
when,the

was,an immediate success.
What,
New,York thought of it is voiced by the
New,York papers. Such is the nature of the play that Delta Sigma will present to celebrate her thirty-second Founder's Day. Sound efTects and scenery design- iiig are of great importance in auc- c>>>ssfully producing the play.
A,"war- time atmosphere is always present, for the action centers in a dugout in the front line trench. Burt C. Pratt. '32, will have charge of sound efTects John"

Men,Coach Carl
C,Snavely explained his vicw.s of two very pertinent cam- pu.-^ problems at the Friday sei-vice] jn frtshman chup>>'l.
He,"attacked the Bii<-kntllian*8 platform favoring a women's smoking room, and also the fact that thi.>; paper agreed with other coUeKes on the point that foot- ball"
was,"being over-empha.sized. ""In speaking of the smoking room afTair, I think it would be just as sensible to include companionate marriage, repeal of the Volstead act, and the unrestricted u.'se of narcot- ics,"" he .-iaid. .\ttackis Smoking In continuing, he declared the t;moking habit a ""filthy"" one, which ""ages quickly, and decreas* s the will power, the reliability, and the de- pendability of thf individual. It"

OVEREMPHASIS,The Bucknellian regrets that Coacn Snavcly Coiiml s<<. little time in fresh-
man,chapel last week really to dis- j cuss our
Alma,"Mater's football ques- , tion, especially in regard tf) overem- phasis. Most of his time was taken { up by a dis.sertation on the evils of smoking, and kindre<l subjects, but j toward the close of his speech Mr. ;"
S,"navel y did reach his subject and re- mark. ""I certainly admit that foot- ball has its evils, but overemphasis I is not one of them. The evils lie in dirty plays, the lowering of school standanls to admit football ])layers, ' the ever-present gambling, and the concurrent dirty tactics."" But are not these evils caused by overemphasis? Would football in moderate doses give ri.se to them ? j And of course it is the normal thing to l>egin spring practice the last week j in February and run it right up to Faster vacation. |"
On,this last point the Bucknellian . feels quite .<<trongly. Is it right that ! the school which produced the great- est baseball player of all time should stress football t..) the detriment of baseball ? Most ba.seball players are football
men,as well. Spring football priic- ticp benefits them physically and in this
way,"prepares for the baseball season, but when the practice seasim almost overlaps with the opening of ba.<<eball .season, the ba.<<eball team i<< bound to suffer. It takes longer than a few days to work a batting eye anil a pitching"

we,live in an interde- ' i)cndent world in which there are dynamic international and economic' relationships.
Our,"foreign inve-st- . ments and trade are increasingly en- 1 tangling us with the rest of th<- world. To ignore this development, and stay out of the World Court is I the height of folly.

During the process of building a more intelligent approach to the problems of world peace and internaticmal exi.stence, the World Court will have an important func- tion to fulfill. Our acceptance of the Root pi-oto- col and memberhip in the World Court in the very near future would do a great deal to lessen the enmity which is daily growing against us in Europe because of our uneonceni id'.ut the"
common,"problems of th'"" world."

Yet the politicians continue to sit liy and do nothing. Let us bring renewed pre.ssure to bear upon the politicians to face the realities of our interna- tional, social, and economic respon- sibilities today. ^......***. * .nil... ....***i Coranado's Children"
make,"ui) a very large family children in ((uest of secret mines and burie.l treasui""es, which Coranado first sought four hundred years ago. In some way, lonjr ago. a legend got .started, tell- ing of fabled golden cities such as that ol Kl Dorado,"
known,"as the gib led man, l)ecause he was sup- posed to have worn nothing but a coating of"
goM,"du.st. Karly in the fourteenth century, the i-'pani- ar<<ls set out to look for these won- drous cities. Coranado spent"
many,fruitless years in our southwest country .searching
for,"hidden wealth. Men have been searching ever since; they have found little, hut still they go on searching. In some respects"
human,"nature is ?< determinj'd thing. J. Frank Dobie's Coranado's Children is a collection of tales, beautifully told, of these"
many,ad- venturers since Coranado.
He,has
made,"a thick volume out of them, a volume full of adventure and idealism. However, since"
the,stories all point toward the
same,"theme, they lose some of the vividness toward the end of the book. Green (Wow the Lilacs makes a very interesting play both to see and read."
As,seen in
New,"York at the present moment, the distinctive featUH' is the aspect of panorama, which is afforded by looking at the buildings from the outside, one wall having been removed. This Lynn Riggs drama will also read well, for its philosophy is promii^nt, ' and its dialogue is smoothly writ- 1 ten. The theme is not important, con- ; cerning a cowboy in quest of a girl ! in the .lays when Oklahoma was ' young. But the dialect, and the i mannei of speakina: are rather ' faithfully don(^. The"
author,creates an atmosphere of realism which will
make,"the reading of , this play stick in the memory. Bird Life at the Pole is another of those charmingly irreverent iron- ies, after the manner of Peter"
A,mo. done by Wolcott Gibbs.
The,"; voyage to the pole, slapsticky in ! parts, is pretty generally amusing all the way from the christening of the good ship Lizzie Borden, and her laborous passage through the"
Panama,"Canal, to the arrival at , the wffmg |M)le up in the northern j regions. There are so"
many,"of ' thcM^ bo.jks lately, that"

when,the Bison ring Unim meets
Army,"at West Point on .Saturday afternoon. Kielb, of dynamite right fame, will don the leather in place of the vet- eran Tcrpolilli, while 'I^)U Russo will replace Kubacki for the one-sixty berth. These changes were brought about in an effort to bolster the en- tire team. Russo and Kubacki fought] a, three-round decision fight yester- day afterno.m to .settle the question Hs to"
who,should fill the position. The battle between these two
men,
was,as fine a fight as <<'ither
man,has ever fought.
At,"the end of the three rounds of milling, there was a ques- tion in the minds of"
many,"of the as- sembled ""railbir<<ls"" as to"
who,"should have the decision. The judges award- eii the light to Ru.ss.), although from the ringside it looked as if another roun.l would have been in order. Kubacki showed a"
much,improveii ring technique over the exhibition which he gave in the Catholic
U.,meet. Russo had the advantage of
more,"experience, having fought on the team during the past two .sea- sons. The one-fifteen- tHjund class will be in good hands, as Kielb has been improving steadily, and at the pres- ent time i.s in fine .shape."

was,"elected piesident, and Stanley Thomson. '34,"
was,elected secretary-treasurer.
The,next meeting will be held at the
home,"of Profes.sor Gates, Tuesday ut 8:00 o'clock. The topic for Tuesday's discussion i.-, ""Tariffs "" and will be led by ""Dave"" Kv;ins, "".i2. IJist week's di.scussion on ""The World Wide Economic Situ- ation"" was led by George Abernethy, '32. It was estimated that there are b< iween 10 and 12 million unemploy- ed in the United States, Germany, and England."
One,"of the chief cau.ses assigned to this problem was the decline in purchasing power over production. The entire situation, it was pointed out, has been coming on for 20 years and centers around the struggle for iTiarkets. Production in foodstuffs has outgaine<l the rise in population, while trade on the whole has decreas- ed. The nations of the world are"
now,"finding out the importance of small markets, and are bargaining for them. Bruce Curry, noted theologist,"
who,"will be on thi' campus tomorrow. Sat- , urday and Sunday will speak in up- ).u rclass ehupel tomorrow morning."
He,"is expecte.l t.i pre.sent his views on moilern religion, and campus proh- j lems. Mr. Curry's talk will be an inter-, esting comparison to the views ex- pressed on ""The Changing Concep- tions of fiod"" as presented Tuesday in this chapel by Prof. J."

The,spirtual theme thus presente.l ii. chaiH'l durinsi- recent meetings of the group was begun in Dr.
Norman,"S. Stewart's talk. 'The .Souls of Men."" given Friday. February 1.'!. Dr. .Stewart contends that"
human,beings do not really know each other. since men's souls lie deeper their gestures and words. than The six occupants of the
German,table in the dining room of the wo- men's college will entertain Dr. Leo L. Rockwell of the department of
German,"at dinner Wednesday eve- ning. His ho.stesses will be Miss Dorothea Shultz, assistant nurse at the women's infirmary, Eunice Sam- son, '32, Evelyn Andrews, Margaret Schafer, Louise MacClaren all of '33 and"
M.,"R. Mish, '34. The"
German,table is occupied by students stmlying German. In an effort to perfect their use of the lan- guage they restrict themselves to tht u.>e of
German,"during meals. The dining room has catered to the desire of language students to sit toi/ether at meals for the purpose of tonveising in a foreign tongue. At the present time, Miss Gladys Cal- kins, of the department of French conducts a table in that language."

Drug,"Act prohibits mi.^representation on the wrapper of a medicine bottle, it does not prevent false and mislead- ing advertising. Taking advantage ot this fact, the makers of patent medicines put out so-called ""cures"" for numerous really incurable dis- eases, the same so-called remedies being either worthies.* medicinally o'- poisonous to the individual"

He,"should bf elected by the direct vote of the peoplfr. But changes should also t; ke place in our e<lucational meth- ods. ""It is not proper to say that the education that our fathers re- ceived is good enough for us; for to- day"

Ubanon,"is coming hero with one of the strongest eoint team> in its history. Albright succeede-i ,n beating I^banon Valley by only one point, and at present Albright is reputed to have one of tlie finest teams in the east. According to several"
members,"of the Albright team, Lebanon has a fa.st and ag- gressive team combined with i strong defense. Starting Line-up lloub'ful"
The,"starting lineup for Bucknell :.^ doubtful, but in all probability it will be the same as in the past two games. Marter, who has ben ijla^v- 1ng a whale of a game, will be .^een a the center po.st in place of Smith; and MiU.-^ seems certain 10 start in place of Chenoweth. Chenoweth lias been ill lately, but if his passing and floor work are any criterion, he is well on the road t orecovery. Captain Ross,"
who,"has an average of twelve points per game, will be at the other forwanl po.Mtion."
The,guard positions will be ably atten<<l- ed to by Hepler and Logan. HeplerV- fine guar.ling has been over.'^hadowe.l by a tendency to foul; if he refrains from this practice Bucknell has a fine chance for two virtorics in its final
home,games. *'^1^'*

The,"Battlefielders seemed at a loss as to how to stop the Orange and Blue of- fense, which was registering steadily iind holding the local hope to a mere handful of points. The work of Marter, big Bison center,"

The,toughe.st assignment (>>n th-' Bison boxing .schedule will be under- taken
when,Coach Rem* takes hi- team to
West,Point next .Saturday t.> fight the Army.
The,Cadets have a very impressjv.:^ string of victories so far this season and as yet have not lost a decision.
To,"date they have .lefeatcd Temple Western Maryland,"
West,"Virginia, and"
New,"York University. In every case their winning has been by a de- cisive margin. In thi' one forty-five class, the"
Army,"is iepresente<l by Mr. Roller, a hard hitting fighter"
who,"has wor. all of his fights so far, and knocke<- out Crosby of Western Marylanu holder of the int^'r-collegiate chan - pion.ship in that weight."

Hagan,foTight a draw with Ixvy of
New,York C. last we<<4; The Bison team is training
bar,for this meet and expects to go t-
Army,in the best of con<iition.
The,"hi av\ weight a.ssignment has not bee <<l,-ci(ied upon as yet, .md it is quit* likely that it will not 1^"

the,"contestant. ""Micky"" Boerner will undoubtedly be in shape to"
Uke,"over his duties in the one iwenty-five <livision. There i* also a cjuestion as to whether Russ< 01 Kubacki will be picked for th. one sixty class. Rus.so, on tht; strength of his work .so far, seem.^ 1(> be the logical"
man,"for the posi- tion. This is the first time a Buckiiel lioxing team has ever met the West Pointers in the ring, and the opening of this relationship is looke<l forwan: to with a great <leal of pleasure by those concerned with the progress of the sport at Bucknell. proven that he possesses courage, j;rit, and other essential qualities that are needed to becon'c a gn-at ring performer.

Boxing,"In the first meeting ever staged bt^tween the Bison ringmen and the ""Big Red"" boxers representing Cor- nell, the Bucknellians came through to win four to three list Saturday night. The meet wa.s a no-decision affair, but various newspaper repre.senta- tives, an<i other persons who saw the meet, gave decisions as to the out- come of the contest. In the Cornell team, the Bisons met with greater opposition than they had anticipated from the Ithacains. This is really the first year of organize<i boxing at the"
New,"York State .school, and in view of thi sfact they have a very good team. Coach Reno was obliged to le^ve ""Micky"" Boerner, one twenty-fives, at"
home,"because of illness. In his place Kielb, a"
new,
man,"on the squad, defended the one twenty-five clas!<< and came through to win handily. ""Trip"" is Steady TerpoliUi fought his usual good fight and had seemingly little trouble in disposing his opponent. ""Trip"" has .shown a marked improvement over his previous work, and is becom- ing one of the mainstays on the team."
He,"has mastered a deceptive stylo of attack and is very hard to hit. Keilb, filling Boerner's .shoes,"
came,through to contribute a win to the Bi.son cause. His
man,was
new,"at th game, thus making tho affair even as far as experience went. : Captain Marchesano did not fight I his usual fight seemingly holding I himself in at all times."
Due,"to this I lack of aggiessivene.ss, the Cornell I"
man,"pik<l up enough of a lead to an- ! nex the decision had one Ijeen given. BienuK Unlucky j In the Cornell one forty-fiver, I ""Stan"" Bienus met a tough boy and | i was unable to stand up under th*- | [barrage of hard punches which were! ' thrown his way."

down,"as a technical knockout for the | ' Cornell team. ""Stan"" wa.s hampered '. somewhat by a cut lip. which be sustained during the encounter. In' Bienus"

In several instances the relation lias l>>een anything but cor- dial, and has hampered good teaching results. The alumni survey was surprising- ly succes.sful. Of the two hundred awakening, graduates to"

"""WhutlS",factors on the campus helped most to
make,"friendships with the facul- ty?"" and"
"""What","factors hindered most?"" the alumni indicated that piactically all of their number had formed some vital friendships in this connection."
Many,"even insisted that these friendships were the most valued trea.sures of the time spent here. , One graduate wrote, ""Having been out of school for two years, I would gladly trade any facts 1 might re-"
member,for moi-e intimate friend- ships with the professors
who,"taught them to me."" Would Trade Facts"
An,"impoi-tant factor that hindereJ the formation of real friendships, ac- ( ( rding to the alumni, was the wide- spread belief that a student actin,: friendly toward a professor is trying to ""cultivate a drag."""
Many,con- fes.-;ed that a fear of this prejudice dominated their relationships with professors during
their,college careers. Those in charge of the alumni sui- the boys and girls of Colgate proved tlial gill- lire superior to

Rebuttal,I
have,
made,
up,
my,
mind,to say
my,say. I shall
do,"it kindly, distinctly: but I"
am,going to
do,it. I
know,there arc
many,
men,
who,substantially agree
with,
me.,but
who,are not in a condition to express their thoughts.
They,are poor: they arc in business:
and,they
know,that should they toll their honest thoughts
--,persons will refuse to patronize
them,
--,to trade with
them:,
they,
wish,to get bread for their little chil- dren : they
wish,to take care of their wives; they
wish,to
have,
homes,
and,the comforts of life.
Every,
such,person is a cer- tificate of the
meanness,of the
community,in
which,he resides.
And,yet I
do,not
blame,these people for not expressing their thoughts. I say to
them:,
"""Keep",
yous,ideas to yourself: feed
and,clothe the ones
you,love: I will
do,
your,talking for you.'
Quotation,
from,
Robert,Ingersoll.

But,solid food is for full

have,their senses exercised to discern
good,
and,"evil."""
From,various reactions to a previous article
we,evolve a
Bucknell,translation to a familiar quotation
--,
"""You",shall
know,the truth
and,the truth shall
make,
you,"sore."""
The,
honorable,

conveyed,to us that the verbal entrees
were,a little elaborate : that the dressing for the piece de resistance
was,too highly seasoned.
We,
assum-,ed that
an,"occassional roast, sauce a la satire,"
would,
add,
some-,thing to a liquid diet.
We,
found,the
assumption,
wrong;,

were,not
accustomed,"to solid foods, quite a part of the"
campus,not
having,treminated their Mellon's

The,"negative further stated ""that his letters"
were,
weigh-,ty
and,"powerful,"
but,his bodily presence
"weak,",
and,his
speech,of
no,"account."""
"""That",I
may,not
seem,that I
would,terrify

and,for reasons of discretion
we,will return to a

we,shall let both
grow,together until the
time,of harvest.
We,can't afford to
gamble,with other people's
"money,",to risk investments that friends
have,entrust- ed to us. We'll play a
game,of watchful waiting until
more,
normal,times automatically help us all.
The,next time a
melancholy,
mood,"requires a safety valve, we'll write the ar- ticle"
and,refer it to that well
known,"mortuary, the faculty"

who,re- et'ntly inspected it. The x-ray ma- ehine is located in room 18 of Kast CollcRe. Several very tine pictures have been taken of the hand and wrist by Prof.
Lowry,and his assistants. One .student had an injuiod wrist x-rayed at Dr. L. P. Fowle's re>>iuest. This
was,"the first case in the therapeutic history of the x-ray machine. Al- thouffh x-ray pictures will be taken in ca.se of need, as has already been done, it is planned to charge a rea- scnable fee for this senice."

According to Dr. Robbins, the ""Ccmimedia"" is an encyclope<iic treatise on medieval learninjf, moidd- e<i into sublimest and most cxiiuisite l)oetry with consummate power and beauty of language. ""The 'Comm<<'ili I,' as Dante called ii, is the mo.st characteristic piece of literature of the Middle Ages. .In a v.ay it summarizes all preceding lit- erature, religion, and culture. ""The .story deals with the visit of Dante through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven."
He,"is guided by the poet Virgil, sent to his aid by Beatrice, his unrewarded love for"
whom,"per- vades the whole poem. Literally, the work"
may,"be interpreted as the actual spiritual experiences of Dante himself. Allegorically, i< repre.scnts the progress of the soul ami the pro- gress of humanity."" Professor Robbins believes there i.- a note of universality in Dante's work."

Monday,I'vcninjr
when,"the (ombined ulee dubs, di- rected by Ualph V. U:irtz, presented their annual concert in the Baptist church."
The,"success of the interesting pro- gram, which was broadcast through Ptation"
"WJBU,",
was,"due largely tr) the etrorls of Miss Grace Jenkins, director of the women's club, and Mr. Hartz,"
who,"carefully jirranged the numbers months in advance. Most outstanding of the groups sung by the combined chorus was the ""Anurican Ode,"" the final number in which Kllen Kvans, *.'iS, was feature.l, and in which the audience also took part. The splendid shiiding, and the balance disi)layed in the choral"
num-,"bers was a tine achievement for im- mature student voices. Applaud ""Italian Street Song"" The nunibci piomjited the audience to the gi'eate.st applause"
was,"Her- ""bert's ""Itali:in Street Song."" given by the men's club ami Constance Williamson, '32,"
who,rendered a group of well-reetived n u
m,b e r s earlier in the program.
Of,"the two groups of .-elections given by the gill's club ""The Little"
"Dustman""","and the ""Choi-us of Sera- phim"" showed the voices to the best advantage."
"""Bow",
"Pown""","and ""Goi.'i* ""Home"" were outstanding :imong the men's selections. This concert, one of the leading musical productions of the season, will be given in nearby towns accoi-il- jng to the plans Vof the directors. It is the belief of Mr. Hartz that the puccess gainetl by these organizations through this presentation will lead to 'greater musical triumphs in the future.."

He,"is a fir.st class fighter, having had"
much,"experience before entering the Ac;:demy. ""Stan"" took the ""bull by the horns"" and fought Roller at his"
own,"game, which probably surprised that individual more than it did"
any,one else. In the .-econd round after Roller had things moi-e or less hi.s
own,"way, ""Stan"" planted a l>e<<utiful risrht cross on the"
Army,"m.in's chin, sending him to the floor."
He,"<iuickly recovered, however, ami after this, it"
was,his experience that carried
him,"through to a victory over the Bison welterweight. KuKso Gets Dra* 'Lou"" Kusso was next on the pro-"
gram,"with McAleer, the .-\rmy 160- pounder. .\t the bell both boys stepped to the center of the ring, but ""I.ou"" stepped fa.-ter, and punched harder to gain the edge in this round. The second round found Russo try- ing hard for a knockout, but he only Kucceeded in sending his"
man,to the canvass for no count. This knock-
down,.seemed to spur the .Army
man,"on, for he came back with a rush to even the round. The third round started with ""Ixju"" again shooting ""his guns in all directions,"" and again he sent the .Army"
man,"to the canvass, but he got to his feet some- how, and the bell found Russo beat- ing a merry tattoo on "".Mack's"" face and boiiy. This bout"
was,a draw.
"""Norm""","Egel fought OKson, the"
Army,"17.^-pounder to a standstill, hitting him with everything except the bucket and the stool. Olson"
was,"out on his feet at the end of the third round. This bout was ;d.so a draw^. ""Dick"" Selkirk, our"

was,"<<lefeated by Coughlin, of"

OUT,

we,have uncovered some very .startling facts.
We,"havf foun.i that our campus is one of the mo.'<<t blessed in the country, for it has"
among,"it.s .students no less than 60 ""gracious gifts of God."" For those high-minded lads of astronomy, it provides 24 ""stars of the .sea."" Times have no need to be dark around here, for"
we,"have 24 entrancing ""lights."" Ah, idle readen?, the answer is this: all names have meanings. Thus far"
we,"have (luoted only the originni significances. For all practical ap- pellations, .John, Mary, and Helen, re- .-peetively."

The,near future of American busi- nes.s was not painted in rosy tints by Dr. Colston K. Warne. professor of economics and labor problems at
Am-,"herst College, in his talks Tuesday on unemployment In the survey of a small city it was foun.l that 4*; percent of the popuhi- tion was employed part time, XI per- cent full time, and 21 percent n(>>t at all. The metropolitan figure of the total unemployed is 21 percent. -According to Dr. Warne, the solu- tion lies in a reorganization and in the finding and fixing of an ideal ratio of production and consumption.

The negro, according to .Mr. Bag- nal, followed the general trend .)f migration in moving to the cities. At present there are six cities in th^ north with a negro population of 100,()0n or over. In asurvey"
maUe,"in Detroit as to the efficiency of negro labor it wa- fi un.l that 80 percent of the manu- facturers thought the negro more ef- ficient than the foreign w.)rkei, but not as efficient as the native white; 10 percent thought they were as ef- ficient as any worker; and 10 percent believed that if they couM hire any other labor they would not hire negroes. There have b>>;en A,'W'> lynchings in .America. Not all of the.se liave been negroes and S8 of this number have been women."
An,important factor in lynching is race prejudice. This ))rejudice leads to
mob,action and

was,"the opinion of the speaker that segregation in the eompulsor>' sen.se is an es.<entially evil thing and is one of the great causes for 10,000 negroes ""going white"" yearly. "".So Icmg as we have an eco- n.)mic system which allows a small group of lieople in posses- sion of wealth to control the government, present liusinesy conditions will go on."" * * >> ""If it were not for the great Iliads of our good ciii/en>"

The two teams have met for the pa.-t three years, the Biscms tak- ing two of the matches. Temple is determined to even the .score and ha- been i)ointing for this fight all .sea- .son. Coach Ueno. heartened by the team'.s .showing against the Army, jiredicts a win unless several"
mem-,"bers of the team fall to mak.' the weight. However, Bucknell follow ers should have no fear on that score since there is a cap:-ble substitute for every"
man,on the squad.
One,oi' the l>est fights of the even- ing should he in the 115-pound class. (^iddin of Temple was the
New,"Kng- ktnd champion in his weight two years ago, but through some injury last season he was forced to leave the boxing"

Wher,"l.epore visited our eanipu.^ recently he stated that Kutcher was the smartest boxer h"" had met in three years of b.^xing. In fact Frankie had to go four rounds to get the de- cision. Like Cuddin, Kutcher was liandicapped by an injury last year and did not fight here. ""Stan"" Bienus' showing against Roller of .Army proves him capable of meeting the be.st"
men,"in the weight, and his tight with Kulcher should be <n- tiemely intere.sting. Bucknell rooters will remember Haubrich of Temple who fought such a thrilling bout with Mutzel last year. Thus far this .-eason neither ifaubrich nor"
Norman,Kgel. Buck- nell's 175-pound

game,of the eveninv on Tuesday.
The,Pi Phi-Delta Zeta
game,wa- interesting only as an example o gooil sportsman.ship. The Delt. Zetas continued to fight against thei: hopelessly superior opponents long after a .score had been plied ui- against them which would have ju.sti- fied their easing up in the game. The

humming,"in the two intci -fraternity leagues, as"
much,of the old-time bas- ketball spirit is being revived the.se wintry evenings in good old Tustin gymnasium.
The,
Lambda,"Chis have bowled over teams right and left in their league, and having <lefeated the Kappa Sigs on"
Monday,"niglit, they should mast througii to the pennant. In the other league the Sigma Chi and Sigma .Alpha Epnilon teams hav' scattenMl things highly and mightily both trams havin'r a dean slate to date. The Bi.Min courtnun dropped the final"
game,of the .season to the St.
Thomas,"five Friday night at Scran- ton by the score of 3X to 27. .At the half the Plant-coached quintet led 20 to 17 as the result of some spectacu- lar basket shooting by Capt. Ross and Chcnoweth, but this lead"
was,soon disj>er.-ed in the second half. Chenoweth was generously ap- plauded for his brilliant playing
when,he was forced out of the
game,"in t'le second canto via the personal route. Zlmler and Petrini, guard and cen- ter respectively of the"
"Tommies,","led the attack in the second half and completely upset all hopes for a Bison win. Capt. Zinder w.is high scorer of the game, sinking four fieM ).oals and three gift shots for a total of 11 points."

Editors,Believe School Football Is Professional
A,recent survey of student editors ii! the south brought forth some in- teresting statements on the hue and cry that has been rai.sed of late re- garding overempha.-is of college foot-' ball.
The,
comment,"of all wa.- surprus- ingly alike in opinion. For instance,' editor"
Dungan,"of the North Carolina Tar Hetd says, ""I think college foot- . ball in general i- tending very defi- nitely toward the professional,"" and I this from editor Moore of (ieorgia'a j"
Bed,"and Black, ""college football is bc-coming professionalized gradually which is certainly unfortunate be- cnu.se of the ill feelings aroused be- tween non-subsidized athletes and| subsidized athletes, scholarly athletes; and the morons."" j Better Coaches j The editors are unanimous in their, desire for the best possible coaches."
They,"are divided on the que.stion of! ""player control."" The majority favor a shortening of the long schedule, and also favor a continued method of letting the public view the games."
Some,"of the editors, however, are in , favor of moderating thi.s somewhat,' mainly by eliminating the high prt's- sure methods used in dispensing tickets. }"
To,
sum,"up, they want the .""iport a* their o\\-n game, with the best coach- ing but without alumni interference: j they want goo<l teams but teams of student-, without .;ubsi<lized player.<>>; they don't ban the public from view- ing their games, but don't care to have the"
games,played primarily <<s public entertainment.

We,"went to see tho Delta Sijfma players interpret ""Journey's Knd"" havinr beforehand witnessed that spectacular performance on Broad- way. Hut unlike"
many,"of the guests Saturday ev.ninK, we did not go with the motion of comparing the two pro<<luction<."
We,wanted to see
how,"a group of inexperienced collegians would handle K. C. SherriflF's gripping drama of lif<' and death in the trenches. Without reser^-e,"
we,can say that Director William DiLancey and his cast staged a drama that surpasses any other production of its type given heie within the last four years.
And,"in addition, at least three"
new,"per- sonalities with acting possihilities have heen discovered. Frederick Votaw, ""M. John Mel- huish, '.S2, and Frank (Jerlitz, '34, were -so consistently fine as to over- balance the remainder of the less- nkillfully handled <haractcrizations. Votaw Interprets ( haracter Well While the subtle undertones evi- dent in the character of Stanhope were not completely brought out by Votaw, his interpretations of the war-worn, nerve-shattered officer"
was,done with a resei-\e that
was,pretty thoroughly convincing. If he had risen to more stnnuous fits of anger and more intense
moments,"of de- pression, he could have ;rivfn"
more,variety to the life of the
moody,.Stanhope. Melhuish
made,"Lieutenant Osborne the (|Uiet, unhunie<i schoolma.ster called for in hi.s lines. But"
somehow,it seeme<l as though his tone was a bit too hirsh for us to grow to love him a.s a fatherly gentleman.
The,"big lump in our throats was strange- ly absent when he failed to return from the attack. Trotter, ns done by C,orUV/.. gained his audience through .-heer amiabil- ity. Tliey liked his optimism and his utter complacency."
He,might have gotten
many,"more laughs had he consistently employed his cockney ac- cent, but he suggested it at times, j and that was enough to suffice. StaKe Setting Natural"
When,"Jack Younghusband, '32, was in full possession of his lines hi? rharacterization was brilliant."
The,scene in which he expressed his eajferness to b<<' off for the attack sparkled with a heart-felt enthusi- asm. Younghusband's greatest tri-
umph,"was the setting of the dugout, which he designed imd executed with complete naturalness. To this .set the play owes no small mea.sure of its success. The speeches in the"
drama,"were written to be said in a staccato man- ner, just like the staccato voices of the guns."
The,cast was not well enough acquainted with its lines to permit of this. Therefore
many,of the talkative scenes (and the
drama,"is very taikativ>>) were slow. The mechanics of ""Journey's End,""j such as the intermittent fl;ire of I Very lights on the dirty .sandbags i outside the dugout door, the rise of | the morning sun, and the cannonade ( oi large and small guns were start- lingly well done. Only once did they , Interfere with the spoken words. Burt Pratt, "".VJ, was largely rcspon- ' si hie for the success of this feature. With the staging of .such un in tensely ambitious production as this, \"
we,find an indication that the better plays can be made convincing to <<;tudents without demanding a semi- Tirofessional cast to present them.

H.,"Cook, alter- nate, all of '.'W, repre.sented Bucknell for the affirmative, while (Jeorge Copeland, Hicks Epton, and Walter Kniery, alternate, upheld Oklahoma. Uobert Cook, the first speaker, painted the evils of the present high taiiff systems by demonstrating that they are wrong in principle and do not conform to the laws of economics. Hicks Ept<m, in introducing the aiguments of the negative, pointei out that if it is ever proper to adopt a policy of free trade, ""it certainly isn't now, if world conditions, es- pecially American conditions, are to be considere<l at all."" Charles Bidelspacher mamtained that the policy of free trade would cori-ect our faulty economic procesises and that <>ur goods would be jiro- dueed nearer the source of raw ma- terials and capital.

Willard Smith, assistant pro- fes.sor of English, in his lecture on the ""Faerie Queene,"" tiie seventli of the world literature course. That the sixteenth century poet and the twentieth century ptiiloso- pher both strove for the same end in different ways, is a point which Pro- fes.sor Smith will"
make,"in his lecture ""Spenser, the greate.st representa- tive of the Klizabethan age outside of the dramatists,"" according to Pro- fessor Smith, ""intended in his"
poem,to give moral instruction and to por- tray the perfect gentleman.
He,"drew his inspiration from Malory's 'Mortt d'Arthur,' the source of .so"
many,"great poets and writers. ""Spenser was undoubtedly a great poet."
He,"showwl love of beauty, beauty of .sound and color, beauty of body an<l mind, and beauty of .'pirit- ual pei-fection. The poem is great as"
much,for its musical beauty as for its morality. There is
much,"in- terest shown in the religion and philosophical questions of his day."""

"'M,","managed to elicit both emotions with enough j over-balance of the dour aspect tn emphasize the c> ntr.d theme. Could i any one fall to sympathize with thei bewildered Mr.<<. Craig,"
who,"moved, trance-like about her living room *itrewing hated ro.-e petals aft.i h<r?

The only trouble I with Miss Snyder's interpretation! *was that ""Dulcy"" showed through even though .sh>>' strove to subdue the vivacity of that earlier role."
Some,"of her uncertiiness, however, was due to a slightly inadeijuate mastery of lines. The steps leading to the slow awakening of a trusting husband were ably trod by Frederick Yust, '31. His portrayal of Mr. Craig was the best individual p<<'rff)rmance of the evening. But then ""Fritz"" al- ways does"
manage,"to plea.se his au- <lience. His reserve and poise are what attract us. This re.serve stood him in good stead as Mr. Craig, for it would h.ivc been very easy to over- do that crucial scene where he coa.ses to be a puppet and becomes himself: a free man,"
who,can smash vases and drop cigarette ashes without asking for con.sent. At least two other characteriza- tions contributed to the succe.ss of this
Cap,"and Dagger presentation. The first of these was Italia Ber- tngni, '*'?1,"

was,outstanding as Miss .Au.stcn. At first she was a bit timid. But when .she

The College Inn, awjire that a distinguished visitor is in our midst, is embarassed at times because someone pulls a boner.

We,mu.st advertise our little vices.
We,"for- get that as dead flies cau.se the oil of the perfumer tu send forth an evil odor, so does a little folly out-weigh wisdom and honor. Buck- nell's endowment fund.s"

The,"<;<<M>>d Karlh, by Pearl S. Buck, ends with the reader vacillating between horror at the materialism portrayed"
and,"with pleasure at the discovery of real story-telling geni- us. This novel, which was the"
March,"""book-of-the-montH,"" tells the story of"
Wang,"Lung, a Chinese peasant,"
who,"rises to be a great lord. Chine.si' provincialism and that blighting force, materialism, are painted in colors <iuite depressing. The misery resulting"
from,a con- centration of wealth in the hands of a few is all too evident
when,one thinks of America's
own,prob- lems in that field. The rich be- come too .lemoralized for culture and the poor cannot afford it. The middle class is absent. The good earth fostered
Wang,Lung in honesty and clean living; wealth ruintnl him. His days were rarely peaceful after he became rich.

Coach Reno's charges .le- feated Temple by a 4':; to 2' 2 score at the hJKh school j?ym Saturday niKht. All of the bouts, with the exception of the ItW-iwund cla>s, were cdosely fontesteil, with the niaru'in of victory' coming only after the hottest com- petition. Clever boxing ability and hanl hitting combine.! to"
make,"the ex- hibition extiemely inter, sting from the spectator's point of view. The first fight, in the ll.'i-poiind class, was a torrid affair from the first bell until the final punch wa.s thrown. .Joe Kielb,"
who,"has sh<iwn constant iin)ir<>venunt with each bout, drew with D'Allesandro, an ex- perienceii and clever boy. D'.AUe- tsandro's experience was matche<l by the aggressiveness and willingness to *mix it up of the Bison mitt . Wins I)e<>>pHe Handitap Hoerner, competing under"

thmugh,"his over-anxii'usness, Bucknell's o n e- twenty-fiver was able to fend off a third round rally and conv through to take the decision. Captain Marche.-anu displayed ex- cellent form and a mastery of the art of boxing in winning from Fischhoff, the Owl's ime-t:hii-ty-fiver. ""Marchy""' bad his"
man,in serious difficulty in rvery roun I. although he la'k;d tli * final punch which would have i>>ut his opponent
away,"for the count. Fisch- hoff fought with an unorthodox, left- handed style, which was net enougli to prevent Marchesano from com- pletely outclassing him. hutcher 'lake's Bout Captain Kutcher, one of the best Tiien on the Philadelphia team'- squad, found Borella no competition, and the"
gume,"but inadequ;ite ^uck- Tiell representative was forced to wj- tire at the close of the- initial round. ""Stan"" Bienus wai<< unable to tight due to ail injury sustained in the en- count<<.'r with '""ajttain .^^tunkavd of ""We.st Virginia. In the l()0-pouiid cla.'-s, IJu.'-so, re- turning to the line-up after an en- forced iayotr, handled the situation admirably, disposing of Guerny with the least trouble of an.\"
man,on the
home,"team. The fight was stopped in the seconii round, when it"
was,"ap- parent that Guerny was in no condi- tion to continue. ""I.ou"" fought very aggic.ssively ,alternating a hard right and left in effective fashion. Kubaiki lost to Haubrick in the light-heavy class, after giving an ex- cellent account of himself. Haubrick js a veteran scrapper and Kubacki's showing against him gives promise that Bucknell will be admirably rep- resented in that division when "".John- ny"" has gained m little more experi- t rcc. HeaxvweiRhl Battle Climax The battle in the heavyweight di- vision was a fitting climax for so ex- citing a meet."

won,"by a wide margin, ilropping his opponent to the floor several time for short counts. Hanson got up rach lime and continued to throw wicket! punches. It was only his toolness and great staying power which prevented ""Swede"" from being put away. The third round went to Kffel as well, and the light ended with the Temple"
man,"rapidly losing ground before "".Vorm's"" determineil attack. Un(|uestionably, Coach lieno's"
men,"exhibited the best form they have displaye<| in any m.itch this yeir, with the po.ssible exception of the meet with the Cadets at West Point. Improved punching and ring general- ship was apparent throughout, being a mute te.stimony to the tutoring of <<'o;ich Ueno."

Sigma,"Chi's team in a crucial game, 27 to 10. The ""Sigs"" kept pace with the winners throughout the first half, and the"
game,"was closer than the score indicated. The S. .A. E. team started early and grabbed a lead in the fir.-l min- ute of play which they never relin- quished. Sigma Chi fought back despeiately, and the .score at half time was 9-7 with S."
A.,"E. <m the long end. With the resumption of play in the second half, Harry Yty, .-tar Sigma Alpha Kjisiion center, eage<l several baskets and put the"
game,"l)eyond the ieach of the oppon- ents. Itose and Miller accounted for most of the Sigma Chi score,"
mak-,"ing H ))oints between them. (Jains Firht Place Beiause of this victory, the S."

whom,Professor R. 1.. Sutherland re- ported to have disappeared forceful- ly from his very doorstep last Wed- nesday night. Until the sophomore president ap- peared on the floor of the

was,"a mystery to all but a very select few, and his friends at the Cotillion con- srratulated"
him,as thougii he had been missinjr on a polar expedition.

who,"had lived it, was"

new,"president for the occasion of the Cotillion, we print the story in detail as told to William Liming, chairman of the Cotillion. Rutledge ""Tells All"" ""After being whisked"

To,The Editor: It seems to
me,that editorials such as your recent one deploring the lack of student interest in current events are a waste of time.
You,.suppose that the purchase of a few more newspapers and magazines would help the situation. Evidently you have not spent
much,time in the li- brary.
The,"funnies, sports, and ro- togravure .sections are about all that interest the average student. The only students"
who,regularly read magazines are tho.se taking the courses in current hi.story. Of course a few
new,additions to the library would give them a wider se- lection.
Why,i.s it that only one percent of our students consistently follow cur- rent events in newspapers and more important weeklies?
One,reason is that our educational .system here i.s so org;mized that important matters =^

Broken glass I (surely not anything but milk bot- tles), orange peels, paper, boxes, j junk, trash, and other articles too numerous to mention (as the sale bill reads ) certainly do not adrl to the beauty of what was once a lovely lawn.

A,quartet of
women,"consisting of Constance Williamson, '32. Ruth Taylor, ';W, Ruth Baker, ':;.'J. and Ruth l.rf'yMei.ster, '.'U, opened the pro"

The,meet i.s a fine thing in that it provides another outlet for the ener- gies of .sports-minded students.
The,"greater the number of sports and sports events Bucknell can have, the better both for college and for stu- dent."
The,ideal behind it all is to ir

LOVL-NEST,"The way.s of the generous are pecu- liar. The benefactor, who recently offered"
four,"American colleges $25,000 apiece if they would advocate the ""return of"
woman,"to the home, "" liceived his due publicity."
Monday,the
New,York Times presented to its readers the story of a London philan- thropist
who,"desires to grive one mil- lion dollars toward building a ""pet- ting palace"" for the use of lovers in inclement weather. The First"
Com-,missioner of the
Works,"in London is in sympathy with the project for ho believes that ""courting in the parlor or kitchen is sometimes embarass- ing."" If all cities slTimld build such ""pet- ting palaces"" a dangerous phase of the traffic problem would be solved at least in Inclement weather. Bui the question remains whether this standardi^.ation will appeal to the younger generation. ALso, would it not be rather obvious to arrange to meet a girl at the ""petting palace"" at eight o'clock sharp?"
How,will the parents react to such a
commun-,"istic encouragement of a ""dangerous diversion?"" As for the furnishing of the palace"
we,believe it might be plausible to build the booths with automobile in- teriors in order that the .surround- ings might seem comfortably realis- tic to the occupants. \ horn so placed that it could be accidentally honked would create the nth degree of familiarity.
The,"TitneH concludes by remarking that ""it should be a great success if it does not beccmie so popular and the palace so thronged as tc defeat its"
own,"purpose."" At Princeton"
we,"solve our tennis and squash court problems by allowing their use for only a limited length of time previou.sly assigned. ""Pardon us, Mr. Astorbilt, for disturbing you and Mazie, but"

The,"annual task of picking an All- fraternity basketball team is an ex- tremely difticult one this year as the race for the championship was a free for all affair with four or five fra- ternities all having a chance at the) play-off. This situation brought ui large number of excellent player.^t into the limelight, and made the job; of .selecting any five"
men,for the first team an unu.sually hard one. j In picking this team the value of i the
man,to the team as a whole wa.- ^ considered as well as the individual brilliance of the players. }
At,the foi-ward posts
Ammerman],and Borella were given the places of honor. Borella
won,his position forj his uncanny ability to score. It was | largely due to his work that the i Lamb<la Chi Alpha team entered the finals.
Ammerman,was undoubtedly j the b<<st choice for the other post.; His floor play
was,"consistently good,; and his timely passes to other"
mem-,"bers of the ""Sig Alph"" quintette ac- counted for a great"
many,"mor>>' i points than ""Shan"" got himself. Fry Selected as Center"
The,"pivot position went to Harry | Fry without any question. His i height gave him an advantage not only on the tip-off, but in taking the j ball from the backboard and drop- ping it through for a goaj. Second choice w.nt to ""Ken"" Miller"
who,"j jumped center for the ""Sig"" team. | Miller would fit very well into thej first team line-up. but Fry play.s a j"
more,experienced and .<moother type of basketball. 1
The,"guards presented a hard prob- leni to solve as there were far more ; good guards in the two leagues than there were forwards. Eastburn, Beckley, Stonebreaker. and Grudkow- *ki present a (|uartette of guards"
among,"which there is very little choice Eastburn and Beckley are ^ placed on the first team because of I the .stabilizing influence which they exerted over the re.st of their i-espec- live teams, at the .<<ame time that ^ they were playing a brand of bas- ketball that is hard to beat. East-"
"bum,",in addition to his floor game! and guarding found time to run up a nice string of field goals in every game. (Continued from page 6) la lent will be uncovered by means of this meet in which any
man,in .school

Ark,and the Floo.l.
we,"have found no connection between the bnal Mater eompanv rates and the public ser%ice they ren.ier. Probably somewhere between .\dam and Noah, the Pennsylvania I>ublic Senice Commission have discovered that there are some very distant rela- tions. Through some queer reasoning"
we,are compelled to support them in
much,greater lu.\ury than our neare.st of kin. Kvery time this

The College Inn ha.s not forgotU-n tiiat not .so long ago, through inability to pay such outrajfeous charge.s, out water was cut off. ten ants were inconvenienced and the life of our business threatened.

We,"recently installed an automatic water system, using a hundred foot well, twenty feet of casing and eighty feet of solid rock."

May,"2 and 3. The subject for the meet- ing in for research upon pressure group* and propaganda. The pnrpo.se of the convention is threefold: to assist in clarifying the fundamental conceptions, to review the existing sUite of the research, and to recommend methods and prob- lems which appear to offer the most promise for further Investigation, should a con.sensus arise in the course of the deliberation. Kach of the"
men,"attending this meeting is asked to submit a .state- ment of his working conception of ""pressure groups"" and ""propagan- da,"" and a provisional delimitation of this field of research."
Women,students woik for grades more often than do men. .Such is one of the conclusions Dr. Frederick
H.,"Lund, former head of the depart-"
ment,"of psychology, reached after a study of students here. Dr. Lund read a paper dealing with this an<l allied subjects on .Saturday at the .second spring meeting of the"
New,York branch of the .American Psychological as.<<<Kiation at Colum- bia University. The following ac- count of his report appeared in the
New,"York Herald Tribune on Sun- day, April 19:"
Women,
IW,Rote Dr. Frederick
H.,"Lund, professor of psychology at Temple University, pre.s<<>>nting the result of the first at- tempt ever"
made,to measure
memory,"over a long period of time, reported that"
women,"students master school subjects largely through rote and verbal facility, without any genuine understanding, and that after a lap.-;e of three years they have forgotten far more than"
men,students. Te.sts of the entire freshmen class of Bucknell University showed that
women,"had forgotten more than T^ percent of their science and mathe- matics after three years, as com- pared with less than 40 percent for men, aeording to Professor Lund,"
who,suggested that
women,"were in- terested primarily in grades, whik | potentate of Arabia,"
men,were more interested in attempt- ing to conquer their physical environ- ment.

Banquet,In a meeting this morning the Sociological Club voted to terminate activities for the season by having a tour of inspection of Lewisburg in- dustries and .social organizations fol- lowed by .1 dinner to which represen- tative business
men,would be invited. It has been the opinion of the group throughout the season that there is not a close enough relation- ship exi.sting between the .students and the business
men,of town and it is thought that the propo.sed program will create more contacts. The so- ciology department intends to
make,u.se of the community as a labora- tory for .ntudy uiid to do this there must be a number of possible con- tacts. The dinner which will b<<> held in the dining room of the
Women's,Col- lege and the other details of the pro-
gram,are to be arranged for by a committee with Professor Robert L. Sutherland as faculty advisor. The debate .scheduled with the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania for yester- <lay afternoon has been postponed at the request of the Pennsylvania de- baters until tomorow. The debate will be hel<l at 8 o'clock tomorrow- evening in Bucknell Hall. The meet with the
U.,"of P. debat- ers .will complete the schedule for this year for the men's team, and will be the feature of the entire .sea- son. The Bucknell team for this debate on the question of free trade will ((,n.sist of Charles Bidelspacher and Franklin Cook, both sophomores. Bucknell will have the affirmative side of the question."
The,"U. of P. team will be compcsed of Harry David.son and Harry A. Taklff. Ches ter Owens, '33, will serve as chair- man. The debate will be conducted in informal style, each speaker being allowed twelve minutes in which to present his main speech and seven minutes for rebuttal. The freshman frolic to be held in the"
gym,"Saturday evening is u.sually considered a .sort of freedom party for the college in general, since it is the first -port dance of the .season, and the restraining bonds of cold weather have been thrown aside. This year the weather bids fair to permit of white flannels and sleeve- less dresses, which is unusual for the Freshman Hop. Decorations of green and white for the occasion will reflect the atmo.sphere of spring. The committee in eharjr-^ has also an- nounced that there will be no pro- grams for the dancers. Chaperonage for the freshman event will be under the .supe\-ision of Professor and Mrs. Ralph Page and Professor and Mrs. Frank Burpee.

NOTES,
From,bubbles to boars and then to babies is the lonjf distance record held by the members of the women's natural dancing classes conducted at the
Women's,"College by tht"" depart- ment of physical education."
When,
we,"last heard from the gauze-clad sisterhood, they were in"
mad,pursuit of bubbles.
Now,"it'.s boars they're chasing. With slow and mea.-iured movements they creep up on the wily beast three times a week. In the order of things, they occasionally make a lunge at him and pierce his hide with their ^^pears. Then they circle around the prostrat*' creature with little skips, giving the impression that each dancer is suf- fering from pains in the feet and i.-. seeking to alleviate the suffering by lifting first one foot and then the />thfr from the floor. Spear Throwing Obstacle The only difficulty in the death of the h*'&>>i is the"
manner,of throwing the spear which causes his demise. Being composed of mere
women,the *clat!<< is in some doubt as to
how,to
throw,its spears. Usually the victim
IS,"given a short reprieve while th>>> <<pear throwers debate over the prob- lem, but he never esca}H's the Buck- nell .\mazons. In order to culm the savage in- stincts aroused in the feminine breast by boar hunting, the class follows the chase with an exercise in matern- al instinct."
To,the sound of a lullaby played on u nearby piano each
mem-,i<<er of the class cradles one
arm,"in the other, gazes soulfuUy at it, rocks the fir.st"
arm,back and foi-th and then plant.s ;i gvntle and presumably ma- ternal kiss on her elbow.
The,class i^ then dismissed until the next stalk- ing party is called. I

Neverthele.ss, he has an enviable reconl of achieve- ment, and, if he should run for presi- dent again, would be elected by a greater majority than before. Dr."
Mary,"Wolfe is an ardent Re- publican and was recently a'.ipointed chairman of the north-central divis- ion of the state council of Republican women, a district which includes twelve counties. Dr. Wolfe was graduated from the Institute in 1891 nation for Judge of the Union-Sny- der counties district.

man,"of the committee on game, he introduced"
many,"bills of great value to sportsmen of Pennsylvania,"

N.,Saturday morning. Leaving at 9:00 a .m. a motor caravan will take the party to White Deer Creek where the party will
make,observations on the bird life of the valley. The
damp,woods of till lofiion
make,it a favorite haunt o;' the- migratory bird>>. That group of <irama-lovers which migrated to State College Friday an<i Saturday to offer Chris
Kam-,"mire'.'? ""Jeeves"" in competition for the annual prize of the Pennsylvania Inter-collegiate Dranvatic Associa- tion, returne<l with an award for the nianu.<<script of the play a.s well as honorable mention for the direction and presentation. The award of $25 was presented to the Bucknell group as first prize in the play writing contest, which was held in conjunction with the dramatic contest. ""Jeeves"" was without a doubt the sprightliest comedy"
among,the six one-act plays offered during the two evenings. Dr. Walter
H.,"Stainton, of the Cornell department of speech, was the sole judge for the contest. In his ju<lgment the be.st play was of- fered by Franklin and Marshall,"
who,gave an adaption of the screen scene from
"""A","School for Scandal."" Penn State was awarded second prize for a melodramatic bit entitled ""Prayers for Pa.ssel."""
Cap,"and Dagger and Frill and Frown's presentation, under the di- rection of C. Willard Smith, received next mention. ""Jeeves"" was well- fitted to repre.sent th<>> final offering of these"
two,"organizations as sep- arate groups. The entire ca.st of <<ix was perfectly chosen, and the per- formance given by them Fridr.y eve- ning occasioned more audible pleas- ure than any other production offer- ed. Cast"
Works,Together Well The sparkling
humor,provided by the lines
was,preserved at its maxi-
mum,"height by the splendid KnglLsh reserve displayed by John Jame.<<>>, '.32, in the title role, and by the hap- py-go-lucky ease of John Anderson, ""31, as the young fellow with a na- ture that is a hangover from his col- legiate day.s. The remainder of the cas, consisting of Franklin Bower, '33 Louise Ziegler, '32,"
Mary,"Smith, '32, ami James I^ees, '.34, supplied a well- balanced background for the compli- cated lovt' affair, which"
made,"the ac- tion quick and convincing. So enthusia.stic is the cast for ""Jeeves"" that the players"
have,"agrreed to respond to student demand and will present the piny on this campus during the latter part of next month. Director Smith,"
who,ha.s worke<l with the author of the come<ly to
make,"the dialogue as spontaneous as po.ssible, has also achieved a smoothness in staging which more nearly approached pro- fessionalism than any dramatic of- fering given here this season. Present plans of those interested in"
drama,"here call for .m evening of one-act plays, one of which is to be ""Jeeves,"" which will be sponsored by the recently consolidate<l organiza- tion of Cap and Dagger. Sigma Tau Delta, honorary English fraternity, will sponsor another of the plays, and Mr. Smith's class in drama will spon por the third."

who,"recently tried to gyp their bootleggers and imbibe some alcohol at the expense of the chemistry department were speedily brought to justice. Prohibition must be working! Instead of abandoning boxing at Bucknell,"
why,not promote a bout be- tween Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis ? The gate returns would be so heavy that free boxing bouts could be held here for years and perhaps a
new,

The biography suffers from over-emphasLs upon the hi.n- torical background, though perhaps the rigors of pioneering could h*i presented in no better way. Adventure has ever been the patroness of the Ursuline nuns and Marie de I'lncarnation was faithful to the tradition. She arrived in Quebec in 1G39 and"
was,soon .straining every resource in an at- tempt to relieve :i smallpox epi- demic which was ravaging the In dian tribes of the region.
For,over 40 years .she lived in Quebec and strove to improve the religious and the everyday life of the In- dians.
Her,"life was one long battle against ignorance, dirt, dis- ea.se, starvation, and cruelty."
Her,efforts were always hampered
by,lack of funds and her hard-won gains were seltlom free from thf^ shadow of the fierce Iroquois. It was characteristic of her that she always got what .she wanted in the end. The thriving Ursuline con- vent in Quebec is today a sub- stantial proof that she did.
The,gentle mystic and her sister nun* played a vital part in the develop- ment of N'ew France.

TALK,
TO,
Lewisburg,
Merchants,
Newspapers,used to tell their advertising
on,the basis o: circulation alone.
Thus,it
was,considered that an advertise-
ment,in a
newspaper,"of 2,000 circulation"
was,
worth,twice as
much,as a similar advertisement in a
newspaper,"with 1,000 circulation."
That,contention
was,a fallacy.
Newspapers,
now,recognize
and,
admit,it.
The,thing that
makes,a
news-,paper valuable as an advertising
medium,"is not the size of its circulation alone, but the quality of that circulation."
Papers,that are read
by,people
with,
money,to
spend,will sell
more,for the advertisers
than,papers that circulate almost entirely
among,
poor,people.
The,thing that
makes,"the ""Bucknellian "" so valuable as a business getter is the quality of its circulation. It reaches every"
one,of the iioo students
on,"the Hill,"
and,
most,of the faculty
and,administration forces.
Repeated,investigations have
shown,that Bucknell students
spend,"about $1,000 a year each."
Where,
can,
you,find
any,other large
group,of people in or near
Lewisburg,"that spends $1,000 per capita per"
annum?,
There,is
no,"such group. Furthermore, these spending stu- dents are gathered together"
"""Here",in
"Lewisburg.""",
They,are not scattered over a
wide,territory or one entire county.
They,
do,not
have,to
make,
any,eflfort to reach this town.
"""They","are here."" If"
you,
want,to get
your,share of the million dollars
Buck-,nell students
have,"to spend, the"
way,is easy.

Afternoon,Gettysburg's ba.seball team came to Lewi.sburg with a big reputation an<l left town Sunday morning with a trreater one. For they not only beat Bucknell in a
game,"last Satur- day afternoon, but also bi-at one of the best college pitchers"
when,they kicked Trudnak all over Loomis field and finally
won,out V.l-^y. In the fir.st six Innings Gettysburg .scored six runs on the .same
number,of hits. .\t this point Trudnak left the
game,"and the Battlefield Bullets kept up the assault on Kenny, scor- ing seven more runs in the final three innings. Four"
home,"inins, two by Enders, and four errors by the Bisons, aided Getty.sburg in its bat- ting rampage. Dutchak and Wil- liams, bore the brunt of Bucknell's attack, securing five of the team's nine hits. Snavely will have to get a better combination if he hopes to ^^^n"
many,
games,this year.
The,
game,"was the first of the .<<eason for the Bisons, but it is evident that Trudnak must have a sub.stitute or two on the trip-s."

WELL,"The varsity track team, handicap- ped by a weakness in the sprints and showing considerable strength in other events, is working out daily in enticipation of what will undoubted- ly prove a tough sea.son."
A,"meet every three days for three weeks is the program, with such teams as Dickinson. Gettysburg and Lafayette to be met. Captain Henry Coates will undoubtedly find this quite tiifficult, as he is the main.stay of the team in the middle distances."
"""Bud""","Wells,"
who,"vaulted for the freshman team la.st year, is develop- ing and should account for some points in every meet. Gene Sulliv;in,"
who,"vaulted for the varsity last year, is again out so that the vaulting as- signments will be pretty well cared for. ""Ken"" Miller and ""Sid"" Lintz are showing the be.st form in the <|uarter, M-ith the exception of Coates,"
who,
may,"run in this distance. In the half mile, Randall is an almost sure running mate for Coates. It is in this distance that C.iptain Coates is expected to .show his be.st form, and it would not be surprising if a"
new,"school record were hung up. The weights will find the Bisons rather weak, but if some of the"
men,
who,"are expecte<l to come out put in a belated appearance, this will be taken care of fairly well. Kresiimen at Wheaton used a novel method of iinnouncing class elections Kive ""e.scaped <onvicts"" were round- ed up by an ""einergemy police"" .stjuad and led to ""pri.son"" in Science Hall. ""Sentence.-."" were pronounced on each"
new,officer. To
make,"it ;nore realistic, the enthusiastic frosh ended the ceremony with a ""prison riot."""

"Do""","with , a package of Camels are giving"
way,to this
new,game. Most everyone has been asked to find the
man,"in' the picture, or locate the lion's body on the Camel (it is not very clear, but can be made out if one recognizes ( that the Camel's tail is also the ! lion's tail). Then, too, counting the' number of e's on the back of the package and choosing the coin that will just cover the word ""cigarettes,"" .ire other standard Camel parlor tricks. ( Here is the"
new,"one, conceived with the advent of the cellophan"" wrapper. Place a wager with any of your friends that you can .stand with Camels and not break it."
You,will i vour full weight on a package of' win and your cigarette.- will not he damaged. The obviou.s secret is that the package is airtight. Experiment with this trick before putting up your month's allowance and you will .see that it works everv time.

when,a student petition de- manding the abolition of the present \ system Jtnd the substitution of the' pass-fail system was presented to acting-Dean George
W.,"Mullins. Thf Rnlletin, the undergraduate publication, ha^ for some time been carrying on editorially a campaifni i in f^ivor of the pass-fail system, an<l finally a student curricular commit- tee drew up the potition con<lemningi the system in use. That the giving I of definite marks leads students to; concrntrate too much on trradfs alone and that the ilistribution of A's iind B's varies disproportionately in the N'irious classes is the basis on which the signers of the petition place their, argument.

Wom#n,"Prove Better SIfepert* Tlian Men. Recent Fxperiments .Show Girl.s are far better sleepers than men, according to Dr. Donald Laird, ""expert"" on the subject of sleep and professor of psychology at Colgate University, where a recent sleep .sur- vey was held."
An,inter-collegiate good sleep con- test was held between the
men,at Colgate and the
women,"at Skidmore college. Resulting figures showed that girls have less trouble going to sleep,"
wake,"up fewer times during the night, are less restless, and have fewer dreams. In addition, fewer girls have to be called t^ice in the morning and in general feel"
more,peppy and less grouchy and are leita foggy mentally in the morning. Prof. I.<<ird attributes this to the theory that
members,"of the feminine sex are neither as active physically or mentally as men. ""Only four hours"
may,"be .sufficient to recuperate phy>>ically,"" he main- tains, ""but mentally"
may,"need eight hours more to be completely re.sted."" (Continued from Page 1) and received his"
M.,
A.,degree from
Duke,University. Since then he has completed work for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Univer- fity of Virginia. At present he is engaged in special research for the Rockerfeller P'oundiition. Other changes will be
made,"in the departments of sociology, French, ami chemistry. Dr. Meyer F."
Nim-,"koff will return next fall as asso- ciate professor of sociology and poli- tical science. Professor Ralph E. Page,"
who,"has held a similar posi- tion, will next semester devote all of his time to political .science and will serve as head of the department. T'rofes.sor Robert L. Sutherland states that an effort will be made to arrange the work in sociology no that Professor Ninikoff"
may,"continue his major Interest in the sociology of the family, in which field ho ha.<< done"
much,"research. Miss Florence Hall is leaving at the close of this semester and her place will be taken by Miss .Majel Brooks, an instructor liere last year. Ralph"
W.,"Harris will also leave, and Bruce Miller, '27, previously an in- structor here, will become instructor in biological chemistry. Professors George"
M.,Kunkle and William
H.,"Coleman, who have both had a leave of absence, will return for the fall term. ""There's entirely too"

The Poly tcchnic lleporter was the host paper ot the convention. Entrance of the Bucknellian into the national association, besides of- ferinp; splendid contacts with col- le^ate new.spapers in the United States, also means that national ad- vertising, hitherto quite meager in the college field, will be amplified through the coverage which the na- tion-wide association will have. , VMnners .\nnounced The winners of the editorial and new^s contests were announced at the formal banciuet held Saturday even- ing at the Hotel PieiTepont. They are as follows: Editorial: Stevens In- stitute of Ti>chnology Stute; second place.

W.,"Han-ison, noted author and missionary, gave in freshman chapel"
Monday,"in his .-peech on ""Methods of Missionary Work."" Dr. Harrison gave a vivid descrip- tion of missionary life in Arabia, .stressing the point that cooperation is one of the essentials of a success- ful missionary life. ""One cannot force religion"
down,"a man's throat,*' he said. ""Missionary work depends upon making oneself one of the people with"
whom,"you are working. ""The missionary learns his duties by being one of the crowd. Arabia can most certainly cure one of such a thing as pathological fa.^tidious- ness. Eating roasted locusts helps to rid one of this so-called fn.stidious- ness."" Dr. Harri.son concluded by stressing the importance of mission- ary work to the moiiern world. T>r."

This is an admonition Irom a writ- er who ha.s (fathered a va.st amount of interesting r<<;iterial which will prove invaluable to campers this"
summer,and every summer. The ar- ticle takes up the story of the
num,erous camp-sites that have been pro- vided by almo.st all of the states for these transient visitor.'!. Dr. Theixs has provided ii guide for travelers
who,carry their houses with them.
He,"is very well e!|uipped to I (id so, for he is a lover of the ()i>en road. This article illustrates his versitality in the field of writing."
From,"the three contestants in the freshman .leclamation contest for *men, held during Friday chapel, Clarence Otto has been selected to receive the prize to be presented at the Convocation exercises in Sep- tember. The other speaKers,"
who,"were chosen for the final contest from a group of nearly 20 entered in the preliminaries, were"
Owen,Saddler and Sidney Sagel. Both of these
men,gave poetical selections of a difficult nature. I Otto's declamation was a eulogy | on
Abraham,"Lincoln. It was an en- tirely new selection, and was done in an excellent manner. His diction and his clear delivery"
won,"for him the decision. Professor J. 1'. Whyte,"
who,"was in charge of the contest, remarked that the event this year was the best he had seen in some years. The inter- est, he said, was displayed in so un- UHual proportions that the contest proved vastly .successful."

who,"was the real or- ganizer of the early British Labor Party. The most notable work of Harie was probably done at the time of the war. Always a pacifist in policy, he struggled to keep the workers of his country from joining the war, and becau.se of this, was of- ten unjustly criticised. The Forum, working under the auspices of the Carnegie Endow- ment for International Peace, has at its disposal a number of ino<<lern book.4 in various economic and poli- tical .situations. \Mien the books have been ilefinitely placed, they will be available to all students and fai ulty members."

war,"in Turkestan."""
When,"the story of the pa.<<;t catches up with the story of the present, the effect gained is more than a subtle illustration of the fact that a man's past and present are not entitles, but in reality, exist side by side, influencing one another.

human,"needs which gave them birth. Dr. Aubrey di.s- cusses God, prayer, and worship from a"
new,and

A.,
He,"is the last speaker on the .schedule of that organization for this year. Dr. Harrison spoke at freshman and upperdass chapel, and at a gen- eral assembly in Bucknell Hall, Mon- day evening. With true, witty anec- dotes and .stories, he illustrated the hidden great importance of Arabia."
He,statetl that th.- most profound influence that the Arab has
made,"on the world is ""simplicity in opposi- tion to the present, needless complex- ity of the"
modem,world. Explains Mititiionary Methods He explained the various methods of the missionary in e.<<tablishinif him.self con.structively
among,"thi> Arabs, and sai.l that ""we Americans have the idea that w.- have been born with a silver spoon in our mouths, whereas, in reality,"
we,have been born with a silver spoon in our brains. It is ti-ue that
we,".ire su- perior to the Persian intellectually, I but believe me, he is our superior in more ways than I have time to men- j tion."" I Ha>>* Humorous Manner Dr. Harrison vivified all of his 1 talks with gestures, grimaces, and I individual twinkles of his large grey ! eyes. .Always speaking in a natural tone, he expres.sed himself in a cun- ning, humorous way. But in .spite I of his affable appearance, he is a 'man"
who,has .seen life. iHe tells the I story of
how,his wife my.steriously I disappeared from shipboard while I they were on their
way,to .\merica. '
He,"has never discovered whether she I was thrown overboani, or whether , she fell into the ocean. In January, after Dr. Harrison ha.- provided proper .schooling for his [children here, he will return to , Arabia, where he will continue the work to which he has devoted his life.

many,dlflferent ways.
No,team was able to ama<<s enoujfh of a lead to feel safe at any time during the proceedings. Tin- wtather sonie-

An,unproj?rameci event furnisht'<<l the Kue'<ts at the Interfraternity Hall with unique entertainment during in termission Friday evening.
A,"new- Chevrolet cnupe, caught between the Reading tracks at the crossing be- hind the gymnasium, was crushed by the fast-travelling Willianisporter, southbound at lk:39 p. m., before the eyes of scores of dan<'ers."
Few,of the eye-witnesses of the accident saw the lone occupant of the doomed car escape a few
moments,before the crash occurred. Only
when,the train had been stopped
more,than ;i hundred yards from the scene of the crash was it ascertained that the machine was empty. Harper
Owns,Car
The,"coupe was owned by William I,. Harper, ex-'SH. Prior to the cras'h, however, it was reported to have l)een <<1 riven down Brown street by a friend of Harper's from Lewis- town. The driver evidently failed to notice the narrow width of the cros-;- ing, for he slipped off the road, be- tween the track upon which the Wil- liamsporter was at that time ap- proaching. After a frantic effort to drive the mf.chine from the path of the train, the firiver realized the futility of his action and jump<<'d from the car. .\ few moments later the Williamsport ""The rapid increase In the l<<Komo tion of the library books is astound ing,"" says Mi.ss Kliza J.

away,"in some remote place where Miss Mar- before she can find them. Sometimes they run down from their shelves,"
when,"nobody is watching, and hide behind radiators, ni other eciually remote corners."
Some,"of the books even leave the library and come back when they feel like it, and it seems that they always mak>>' them.-elves scarce just at the time they are wanted. Strange as it"
may,"seem. Miss Mar- tin feels tiiat students are putting the.se books up to their naughty loco- motive pranks of leaving their habi- tat. At any rate, the books are still going strong, and the"

They,"are fresh, moving, and full of stirring life. And since it is the first poetical volume which combines all these attributes, it is well worth your having. Soon this $2 book will be sold on the campus by a .student represen- tative. If you are still in lioubt as to whether you should indulge in a copy, just borrow one and read Christopher Morley's preface. It's K^reat! In an enchanting paragraph con- ci'rning the experience of the writ- ers in this book he says: ""They have visited"
museums,"and librar-' ies, seen 'the curving backs of trains,' and cattle with frost on their chins, said goodbyes, cursed God, and thought a good deal about death and corruption."""

The,"first prize offered in the con- test will be given to Dave Evans, who.<<m conte.st selection was outstand- ing"
among,"the speaker.s. This award, which will be presented with all other such prizes at the time of Con- ^ocation, is the largest amount offer- ed for a single presentation. .Since the judges could not come to a decision concerning the winner of the second prize, they agreed to di- vide it between Arthur Guldin and Georgt' .\bemethy, both of"
whom,were excellent in the delivery of their arguments.
X,"third prize was also awarded as Third Prize Awarded << result of the contest. It i.s the Gret- /inger prize, which will be given to David Davis for excellence in oratory. Those"
who,"judged the en- tire event were Professors I^eo Rock- well, .Arthur Brandon, and .Iame.=? Whyte. I Topics for the four arguments pre- .rented were varied. Those of Evans i and .\bemethy were concerned with more tangible subjects, such as dis- armament and world peace respec- tively. Guldin and Davi.s, on the other hand, devoted their time to dis- cussion.s of"
"""What","Does the Future Hold"" anrl ""Klements of .Success."" This is the first time that the con- test has been hebl in chapel before a greater portion of the student body. The success of the venture prompts Professor Whyte, who is in ch.nrge of all public speaking contests, to con- tinue thi.s method in the future."

At,the .same time that the varsity track team is in action on

men,"from the same schools, .Su.squehannn and Oiekinson. In each of these encounters th*- frosh should have things pretty"
much,to themselves as they have a very good team. The defeat at the hand.* of the
Wyoming,.Sem team gave Coach Titus an opportunity to .see where the weak points in his team jire and will enable him to take step<< t(; fill these gaps.
The,"frosh are coming along fine, and will \m^ a big help to tiu' var>ity next year. With their help and the n.en"
who,"are h-ft from this season'.*; varsity, a goml team should result.

Many,"large colleges frtqutntiy hold such sings, which are lookeii forward to by the majority of the student body. It is hoped that the sing on this campus will create a greater interest in outdoor singing to the extent that better cooperation"

when,
Lewisburg,so- ciety lets its light shine for the swivel chair patriots of the
American,Legion.
For,the sake of the gray squirrels about town. Bucknell fraternities put aside a
week,for nuts
and,call- ed it Hell
Week.,
As,"a sort of sympathetic approval, even the"
Women's,College smelled of fire
and,
brimstone,last week. Tradition tells us that Hell
Week,originated
with,an in- fant prodigy.
By,precocious
development,"along the line of fraternity initiation, he started this institution."
But,the fruits of Hell
Week,
proved,that his intelligence flowered ton soon.
The,brilliance once
admired,in
him,
had,long ceased to exist. Still
hungry,for the acclamation that
was,
once,his. he conceived
and,carried out acts
which,
were,indicative of either a
low,grade of intelligence or a lack of mental balance.
The,"fraternities themselves, in a sort of chronic adoles- ence, still cling to this"
custom,born in the mentality of
swad-,dling clothes.
A,slave of tradition. Hell
Week,has reached the saturation point of its Satanic significance: a
week,of in- terrupted scholastic activities for
everybody,; the initiation of
freshmen,"into the putrid cesspools of the upperclass mental- ity, the inane quest of notes"
and,"signatures,"
and,the
crowning,tomfoolery of all. the dedication of a holy
day,to a
minature,
Noah's,
Ark,at each fraternity house.
The,presence of a goose or
two,
and,
some,farmer's ass is
good,circumstantial evidence that
some,of the
boys,
were,
homesick,for their
remote,ances- tors. Hasn't this
marathon,distinction of choice idiocy set a record for all time? Let's destroy this
worship,of imbecile tradition
and,build a
new,altar to originality
and,decency.
Perhaps,there is another
prodigy,in
our,midst not yet
gone,to seed.

was,"the fact that the sorority cliques held to party lines. Pi Beta Phi, Ilelta Delta Delta, and Alpha Chi"

More,"votes were cast in the class of 1034 election than were cast in the two other class contests, but the class of 1933 had the greatest per- centage of its membership voting. (Continued on I.ast Page.)"

Yester- day afternoon the members of the club, together with students of sociol- ogy cla.sses visited the Evangelical Home, the Lewisburg National Bank, the woolen mill, and the chair fac- tory. Following the afternoon's visits, the club held a ban<|Uet in the"
Wo-,"men's College dinir.g room, to which various business"
men,"of Ix-wisburg Were invited. The tour and dinner were conduct' ed as a fitting wind-up to the various surveys of Lewisburg which the members of the club have made as a part of the activity of the year. In the tour of the afternoon, inter- est in both the technical and social aspects of the institutions visited \va< evidenced hy the students. P'acts heretofore unknown or unthought of were impressed upon the vi.sitors. Features of the banquet in the eve- ning were the reports from the com- mittee's which have"
made,"studies in Lewisburg, and short talks by Dr. Winters, superintendent of the Kvan gelical"
"Home,","and by Dayton L. Ranck, comptroller of the L'niversity. Committee reports V'fre given by Mildred Walton, '32, Klizabeth Wil- son, '31,"
Myra,"Grigg, and Glen Rol- lins, '32. These reports proved of great interest to tho representatives of the town present. Dr. Winters gave a brief de.scription of the"
Home,and its operation and pointed out that this

Coates, to lie con.^istent with all of his preceeding performances, came through with firsts in the ndle and half mile. Sti-ength in the weight event- caused the preponderently large total in favor of the Battlefielders. In the 220, broad jump, and javelin they scored clean sweeps, while Bucknell's only grand slam came in the two- mile inin.

mem-,"bers of the .senior and junior classes as the swingers of paddles. The .sophomores will pull the tra- ditional disappearing act, leaving town to find secret hide-outs, since it is the custom that, after the fresh-"
men,have
nm,"the gauntlet and have become sophomores, they .<<eek any"
member,"of the class of '.33 and mete out puni.shment accordingly, usually in the form of a convict-haircut. E<lward J. SmaLstig, '31, president of Senior Council, announced today that all freshmen will assemble at Tu.stin gymnasium tonight at"
S,"o'clock, bringing with them regula- tion-sized paddles. Freshmen must wear their dinks an<l black necktie*."
A,"large crowd is expected to witnes.<< the traditional celebration, as the"
members,"of the claaa of '34 become .sophomore.s. This morning and afternoon found an increasing exodus of sophomore men, and as the Backnellian goes to pi-ess, very few members of the claRs of '33, remain in Lewisburg."
How-,"ever, several decorative haircuts arc expected to grace the"
campus,"tomor- row morning. It is expected that the juniors and seniors will, a.s in the past, form a double line across liOomis Field, throufh which the freshmen will run. .After this ordeal, the freshmen will di.scard their dinks and other fresh-"
men,"accessories, and set oat in search o< the seci*etive sophomores. It is hoped that the datiiaice and destruction of former moving-up nights will not be repeated this year, since the freshmen will be propor- tionally assessed for the amount of"

E,"Believe it or not, some of the most superstitious beinRs in existence live right here on the campus. Not all students are superstitious, and prob- ably the percentage of the supersti- tious is small; but nevertheless there are"
many,
who,"actually do believe in >;igns and |)ortents. In an effort to discover just what such superstitious students believe, an inquiry has been"
made,"concerning these superstitions, and each of those included in the following list is be- lieved in by at least one Bucknell student."
Some,of these beliefs are accepted generally by the credulous. The list of superstitions that has been gathered on the campus is a> follows: If one sees a
woman,"driving an automobile, one should pull his hair three times or bad luck will follow. * * >> Talking about having a flat tire on one's car is apt to ha.sten the advent of a puncture * * * << * Dropping a knife is a sign that a female visitor will arrive soon; a fork, a male visitor; and a spoon, mixe<i company. * * << << * One sliould never count the num- ber of cars in a train one is riding, since this"
may,cause a wreck or other disaster. * * << >> * Laughter at night will brimr sad- ness in the morning.
One,"should never cut his hair be- fore the full moon unle-s he is not afraid of becoming bald-headed. * << * * * It4>lieve That Wart If one finds a penny, rubs it on a wart, and then throws the penny over his left .shoulder, but >>loesn't watch where it goes, the wart will vanish. * * << << * If one bathes a persistent wart in a stagnant pool of water in an old stump which has not been intention- ally .searched for. the wart will soon f'isappear. * * * * * If one is bothered with warts, one should cut a potato in half, rub it in the morning dew, and conceal it in a rftin spout. As the potato rots, the warts will disappear. * << * * * IlV Bad Luck"
To,It is bad luck to count one's win- nings in a poker
game,until the
game,has been finished.
*****,Lighting three cigarettes from the same match will bring bad luck.
*****,Breaking .i mirror will bring one Brenner. '29 seven years of bad luck of the worst kind.
*****,To carry a corpse head first from a hou.<e will cause bad luck. * * * * * Never lock a bird up in a room since bad luck
may,"come. * * ii >> If one sees a foreign license plate on an automobile, one should stnke I the person near him three times or bad luck will come."
*****,If the first visitor in the
New,Year is a
"woman,",it is a sign of bad luck. * * * << << Never tell a bad dream to anyone before eating a breakfast or bad luck will befall one.
*>><<**,Baseball BeliefH Walking around the
home,plate
when,at bat will bring good luck to a baseball player. * * * * * If a baseball team on the
way,to a
game,"sees a tixick-load of barrels, it is a sign that the batting average of the team will be doubled. * * * * * It is good luck for a big league baseball team to be in the lead on July 4 since that team will have the best chance of winning the pennant. * * >> c * .Marriage Will Ueitult"
When,"one does not blow out all the candles on .i birthday cake, it is a sign of an approaching marriagf."
*****,
To,fall up the stairs is a sign that one will be
manied,before the next vear. << << * * * If on<' crosses hands with another
when,"passing something at the din- ner table, it is a sign that a mar- riage will take place soon. * * * * * If a girl and fellow are out walk- ing at night and one of them sees a star over the left shouhier. it i^ a sign that the couple will be married in the near future. * * * >> * Kain Hath tharms*"
To,"get married on a rainy day is to in.sure one's happiness during the, lomaindfr of one's married life. i * * * * *"
Whenever,one dreams of a beloved 1 friend
who,"has been dead for a long, time, it will be sure to rain the next j day."
<<,. I * * * >> * If the initiation of a
new,"under- taking is begun on a rainy day, es- pecial good luck is tipt to accompany the enterprise throughout its career."

Professor,"Sprague. ""is not Cahleron at his best, by any means, but is interesting as an attempt toward liberal thought. The play is not notable for any deep penetration of thought, but consider- ed against the background of the universally Catholic Spain it is a de- cided effort toward freedom of living. Professor Robert L. Sutherland'- Sociology class fn ""conflict"" tried a"

Monday,evening.
The,class met in Professor Sutherland's
home,at 7 o'clock for a two bour .session.

X*XXXX%%%%%%%%%%%>>3kXXXXVx5,That the 1931 coUeg*- graduate will be seriously handicapped in his se- lection of a position because of the current bu.siness depression wa.s re- vealed in a .-survey of key industtjii organizations by the National Stu- dent Federation of .America. Only one company of those reply- ing to a form letter addressed to per sonnel directors of 50 lirge corpora- tions reported that it would employ the same
number,of college grad- uates in 1931 as in 1929 and 1930. R.
H.,.Macy
&,"Company, large New- York department store, will add"
SO,college
men,"to its staff this year, the same as in the two previous years."
W.,"T. Grant Company, chain store organization, has taken on 26 college graduates <<iuring the first three months of this year, as compared to 34 in the same periixl of 1929 ^md 20 in 1980."
One,Reduces 90'-
One,of thf nation's Iradinx employ- ers of college an<<l university grad- uates will reduce the
number,en- gaged this year by more than 90 per- cent of the number hired in 1930. and about 93 percent of the
number,in 1929.
An,"important industry will fmploy 50, as against 460 in each of the two previous year.<."
One,"of the largest chemical concerns of the country reports a 20 percent reduc- tion, and a leading utility which em- ployed 7(>> college graduates in 1929 engaged none during 1930 and will not recruit any additional material this year."
One,of the principle cor- porations in the oil Industry will em^ ploy 11 this year as compared to 37 in i929 and fi7 in 1930. In every reply except one where a
*,curtailment of an expansion program w;is deeme<l necessary the chief rea- son for the reduction in the
number,of college graduates to be employed was not the failure of those
men,"hired in the past to meet expecta- tions but solely economic condition:^. In reviewing the replies to the ,,UPstionnaire. Chester S. Williams executive secretary of the National Student Federation, pointed out one of the .statements of the situation as **The Proper Attitude"
Toward,"Truth"" will be the subject of a ten- minute talk which Dr. J."
W.,"Rice, profe.s.*or of bacteriology, will give tomorrow in freshman chapel. This will be the last of the serie.s of talki* on rational religious attitudes which J. Hillis Miller, dean of freshmen urrange<l for the last ten chape periods. ' Dr. K."
W.,
Hunt,and Profesiiors
C,
M.,"Bon.i, I-. 1.. Rockwell,"
N.,"H.i Stewart, and P. L. Harriman have already spoken before the freshraen^^ on religious attitudes."
Dean,
Miller^,chose these
men,"because of theii: ac quaintance with the subject of re liglon. Professor Ualph F. Hartz is sched- uled to direct a song est Tuesday similar to that given in freshman chapel la.st February. .Ail freshmen will join in the singing of, old-time airs, the word.s of which '^III be flashed upon a screen arranged for the purpose. According to"
Dean,"Miller, the last program of this kind met with"
much,approval.

SUNBURY,Thirty
members,"of Sigma Tau Delta, honoi-ary English fraternity, banqueted at the Home.stead in Sun- bury, Monilay evening, ha a final event of an active season. Trennie"
E.,"Eisley, president,"
was,"in charge of the proceedings. Aside from the student members, five of the faculty were present, Pro- fe.^sors Harry"
W.,"Robbins, l.eo I.. Rockwell, Jennie"
D.,"Phillip- S. Robinson, and Byron S. head. Mrs. Hollinshea<l"
wa,"puest of the organization. Favors for the banquet consisted of attractively bound booklets, con- taining 26 original poems, one for each letter of the alphal)et, written] by Nancy L. C.riffith. This collection i of poems is perhaps the be.st ever, published on this campus by a single i author. j BncourageK Writing i During the past year"
Sigma,Tau Delta has been very active in en- couraging literary endeavor
among,the .students. JIany of the contribu- tors to the book of Bucknell Ver>><< are
members,"of the fraternity, and several of them arc actively engaged in writing for the Bueknellian. Al.so this year the fraternity is fponsoring: a play written in coUab- oraton with one of its members. This is the first venture into this field that has been"
made,"by the organiza- tion .""rtnce it was instituted here over four years ago. 1"
--,Strike One
A,petition from the stuilents of the University of St. Lawrence to the df-an with the threat of a .strike if their demands are not met reads:
"""We","petition that all fraternities ,in<l sororities, including clubs, b Riven the privilege of June parties which .shall hist until 2:30 a. m. and that the girls shall not have to be in their rei^pective homes until 3:00 a. ni. (This .seems a modest enough re- <<iuest; not a great deal can happen in half an hour, you know). ; Furthermore,"
we,petition that the recent ruling forbidding the parking (if girls on fraternity porches during! the daytime be abolished.
(Why,"the! faculty should object to thi.s is in- conceivable. Is not sunshine prefer- able to mo(mlight, at least to the j minds of the older generation where fiaternity porches are concerned?) 1"
The,"dean apparently didn't even] find the parentheses interesting.: Says he, ""I wi'l fight their demands' to the finish."" I ( Cuts Not So Unkind ; Absences and cuts from classes have been decreasing over an aver- aKe of five to eight percent a term for the past five years, acconlin^ to the excusing officer of Michigan State. Kxcuse absences for the year of 193(1 showed a total of about 3,013 a term, which is a drop of seven percent over the figures for 1929. This number i.s slightly less than the number of excused absences. This indicates a sizeable decrease in cuts."

Courw,at .Michigan The third ann\ial short hotel course iinder the joint .supei-vision of Michi- gan State College and the Michigan Hotel Association opened ye.sterday with one of the largest enrolment- since the beginning of the course. The projfram for the cour.se include- noted persons from all branches of the hotel industry as well as Michi- gan State College professors.
*****,Coed
ModeU,Not model coeds.
When,"a large department store of Baltimore, Mary- land, presented a fa.shion show of spring and"
summer,"apparel at West- ern Maryland College coeds were used as models. They displayed cos- tumes of all degrees of fonnality, from the simplest of tennis frocks to the most elaborate of evening en- .sembles."
*****,College Rah Rah The rah rahism of college life is satirized by
Dean,
Max,
McConn,"of T.ehigh in his second book, ""Stuiiie-; are not Everything."" It is a diary of a"
"""dumb""",freshman
who,"attends Hig- gins College and leads a hilarious life there. The novel has everything from hip flasks, road.sters, and ex- pulsion fi""om college."
*****,Pick and Choose That's what the editor of the Duke University newspaper mu.st do at the Junior
Prom,to be held there. Hf must pick and choo.se the best look- ing and the be.st dressed jrirl at the event. Then he will probably go into retirement. If he has any com-

"""No",matter
how,"much knowledg- you possess, you profit by nothing if you have no love."" This i->> the opinion of Dean Uivenburg,"
who,"in his talk on ""Mother's Day"" before the freshmen in chapel ?>iday, .show- ed the relation of this fact to every- one existing. "".Someone has .'<<aid that a mother's part is a small child's idea of Heaven,"" he continued. ""One can- not over-estimate the value of the mothers of our nation."" Dean Rivtnburg cited .Abraham Lincoln and"
Thomas,Edison as true examples of mother love.
He,"cjuoted the former a.s .<<aying, ""All that I"
am,and all that I ever hope to be I owe to
my,":ingel mother."" The latter announce*! that his mother was th<* making of him. In concluding the Dean .<<aid, ""I trust that no one of you will bring pain or shame to your mother."
Show,"your affection toward her before it i '^ too late."" The newly-organiz.'d string orches-j tra, which has appeared so success-' fully on the campus under the direc-| tion of Miss Charlotte Armstrong,! gave .several .selections in freshman chapel Tue.sday. ] The fino amount of applause which] followed each offering testified t(c) the popularity of this group. Miss Elizabeth Kinney, knox^m here for her violin Indent, also did outstanding >o!o work on this program."
Many,requests have been
made,"to .Miss .\rni>trong for future program- on the campus this year. These, however, cannot be gratified this .season due to the lack of sufficient time to assemble another program."

--,Important meet- ing i.f the
new,"staff Friday at 4 p. m.. at the University Print shop. All memb<<>r* must be present. Nancy L. Griffith, '31, has created quite an enthusiastic stir in poeti cal circles on the campus this week with her Philosophic Primer for Morons. The author had previous- ly written a number of short stories, a one-act play and .several poems. V)ut refused to submit any of them for publication. The inii- tor of the Bueknellian finally per- suaded her to collect her latest ef- forts and the first editions of the collection were given as favors at the Sigma"
Tau,Delta banquet
Monday,night. The resultant anthology has a
poem,"for each alphabetical letter, and the thesis of them all is found in Nancy's preface: ""liet us con- cede that morons do have their philosophy"
and,"philosophy its morons."" There is a devil-may-care air that seems to iiccompany each poem, yet .some are whimsical, some ;ire romantic, others are more material, but nearly all have a clever twist that raises them far above ""just student poeti-y."""

A,large neon sign displays the exterior of the show house and carries the announcements of shows. This sign is one of the large.st of its kind in this region. The decoration of the house has been done in a modified modernistic manner. The lamps lianglng on th<<' walls are distinctly modernistic.

"""DOCKIE""",
LAWSON,
Philosopher,
and,
Friend,
What,shall it profit a student to
have,"a pleasing voice, to be a"
good,"mixer, to"
have,"repute as a school politician, to"
make,a fraternity
and,"attain social distinction, to"
win,his
B,
and,"all that, unless"
he,has
some,
good,specifications
and,plans
about,life.
The,only motivation that can coordinate
and,synchron- ize his gifts
and,callings is a philosophy of the
Golden,Rule.
Following,"one life trail,"
he,will leave the
world,"a little better place to live in ; but if selfishness, raised to the"
Nth,"power, is the other destination, he will"
hcxk,his soul
beyond,the price of redemption. Dr.
George,
B.,
Lawson.,"professor of philosophy, has in- .spired the motivating force of"
many,students. His
moral,blueprints are directing youthful
minds,into the pleasing ar- chitecture of
harmonious,neighbors.
Probably,
more,than
any,"other professor, he is continually interviewed on the vital"
problems,of life. Students
have,
found,in
him,a sincere con- cern for their welfare.
His,recent illness
and,enforced vaca- tion has been a severe loss to this institution. Dr.
Lawson,enjoyed the rich heritage of a cultured Christian
home.,
His,distinguished
and,scholarly father
many,of us
knew.,
Almost,ninety years old. he had retained
much,of his old-time fire
and,"zeal,"
and,reflected as in a mirror the kindly look of one
who,
throughout,life
had,gone about doing good. Dr.
Lawson,reflects in himself the best features of
an,"older school of philosophers,"
and,yet he possesses a
keen,
and,searching
mind,that has rhade
him,
one,of the
modems.,
He,"is a product of metaphysics, philosophy, mathematics, history, the classical languages,"
and,English literature.
Modern,"study along psychological lines, pedogogical"
methods,
and,the
newer,sciences have kept
him,in the
vanguard,of latter
day,teachers.
We,
have,built
up,a tradition
around,the older college professors.
They,
had,
become,"a distinct type in our art, liter- ature, gossip,"
and,caricature.
Their,figure
was,unique in our imagination if not in fact.
They,
connoted,
profound,
thought,
and,absent-mindedness. Let
us,be charitable to our local
owners,of plug hats. Their thinking
--,of themselves
--,
had,
made,everything else oblivious.
Big and,little
Dicks,just na- turally get that
way,
--,
somewhat,stiflT
and,stuck-up.
The,old professor has been regarded as
slow,
and,"impractical,"
more,"particular about his accent than his dress,"
more,
concerned,with clear thinking than
with,
homelly,duties of
everyday,"life,"
more,in love
with,his
many,manuscripts than the needs of his up-to-date family. If Dr.
Lawson,
has,ever
attempted,to be a
dreamer,his
good,wife
and,family
have,kept his feet
on,the ground.
While,he
may,"porV""ay"
some,"of the characteristics of an older generation,"
he,has retained only the best.
This,
good,professor is likeable in
and,out of the class room.
His,ability in the use of the English
language,has
marked,
him,as
an,outstanding patron of the art that encour- ages
and,speeds
up,
American,slang into
good,usage.
With,plenty of strength in his adjectives
and an,"occasional mild ex- pletive, his conversation does not lack spice"
and,pep.
He,has
shown,justice
and,
sympathy,
toward,"his students at all times,"
and,likewise
an,appreciation of the student viewpoint.
Un-,derstanding
human,"nature in general,"
he,is a congenial
com-,panion with a cheerful disposition.
He,is
open-minded,
and,
mellow,in his charitable
judgment,
and shows,a
wide,view- point.
He,reflects a tolerance
toward,
non-academic,pursuits
and,all religious
and,political beliefs. Just
human,
enough,to keep
from,a sour
and,"repulsive piousness, with a"
keen,
and,ready sense of
"humor,",
he,has
shown,himself capable of con- tinuous intellectual gowth.
One,of the beliefs prevalent in the
day,"of ""09"""
was,that the selection of a professor
was,
more,important than the sub- ject matter.
When,Dr. Harris
became,
annoyed,one
day,at
some,frivolity
and,authoritative traffic signal
--,first at the of- fender
and,then at the
main,exit.
Thereby,the writer really slipped
one,over
on,the
good,Doctor.
By,his
own,"potent suggestion,"
we,
had,the privilege of taking the term's
work,"over again,"
under,Bucknell's best qualified teacher of all time. If
we,
were,trying to get
through,college again. Dr.
Lawson,
would,
head,the list of all our electives.
He,
has,
come,nearer than
anyone,else
we,
know,in taking the place of Dr. Harris in the teaching
segment,of his
many-sided,career.
And,"further,"
we,
would,place
him,
with,Clarence
Johnson,
on,the pedestal of
new,
Bucknell,professors as
one,of the
two,choicest spirits discc/^ered by Dr.
Hunt's,administration.
His,
independence,"in thought and speech, his"
"humanity,",his un- erring
judgment,
--,speaking
with,authority
on,the deeper
meaning,
and,
worth,while pursuits of life
--,all these proclaim
him,a
good,disciple of Christian Philosophy.

members,"of Pi .Sigma Alpha, national honorary political science fraternity at a dinner, Friday evening in the Fireside Coffee Hou.se."
"""Many",irimcs are committed un- intentionally by people
who,are not criminals.
The,"real criminal never reforms,"" the speaker continued."
Mr,"Hoffman said that environment ami faulty education are the factors that: lead to the existence of criminal' characters. If< Fingerprint Expert The chief of the uijreau Is a finger- print expert, and he showed to the"
members,of the fraternity specimens j of criminal finKerprint-s explaining the method by which they could bej identified. Mr. Hoffman .spoke in the after-! noon to the
members,"of the fratern-j ity, and others intere.sted, at a meet-! ing in Bucknell Hall. There, too,"
he,"Kpoke on the methods of identifying, criminals by means of finger print-' ing. Illustrating his points with, tAle.s of his personal experiences, Mr. 1 Hoffman seemed the per.sonification ' of a good detective story. Kven the| brief ca^e that he c<<rrie<i with him | had a bullet-hole through it. Several"

*****,Sleuths at .Antioch College
men,in ovemlls from An- tioch College have recently completed a survey which shows that laboring
men,"are inclined to slow up produc- tion in order to maintain wages. The survey was made by Stanley B. .Ma- thewson, personnel director at .An- tioch, with the help of six students. These"
men,donned overalls and worke<l as
common,"laborers while trying to find out whether lalxir real- ly does its be.st.

FRESHMEN,"""Do you know that you are equip ped with a magnificent mechanism which you are allowed to operate without a license?"" Dr. J."
W.,"Rice put this <iuestion before the so-called ""embiyonic sophomores"" Friday in chapel in the course of his talk on ""Rational Attitude.- Toward Truth."""
"""When",
we,"consider truth as an ideal,"" he said, ""we discover that"
we,are dealing with a dynamic pa it of civilization.
We,"have not yet com- pletely gone out of the borders of the Dark Age.s."""
"""By",tracing back to primitive times it has been found that there arc three ways to .solve the problems which have been in the world from the
dawn,of
human,"existence to the present time. In the first place, there is the level of instinctive ac- tion. Then we have the growing up level, and finally the level in which the conduct of a person is modified by an id<<'al."
On,the last mentioned level
we,"meet our mo.<<t intelligent individuals."" In closing Dr. Rice stressed the fact that where there is a desig.i there is a designer."
He,sugge.sted that everyone follow the
way,of good designers
--,"^that of truth. Perhaps the greatest factual edu- cation in the world can be gained by standing behind a cii-culatinj^ desk in most any library. College libraries are particularly good, since the col- 1>> ge student is accustomed to asking anyone any <|uestion he cannot settle for him.self. Mr-. Elizabeth Wright, assistant iiVirarian at the Carnegie library, has been particularly interested in Ibis type of education, and with the idea of passing on the knowledge ac- quired by her within a single 24 hours, she has made a list of .some of the more choice (juestions.

An,"other question that once stumped a bibliographer at the Congi-essional Library was: ""^Tiat is the value of the gold fillings in the teeth of the dead buried in .American cemeter- ies?"" The assistant librarian says that she will be glad to as.sist any pro-"
uram,committee in getting up a list of problems for (juestionnaires to tide the party over that dull moment. *

Warren,"Sweet, profes.sor of the history of American Christianity at the Univer- .sity of Chicago Divinity School comes forward with Religion on the .Ameri- can Frontier."
He,gives us a hi.story of the American frontier in terms of religious movements. It is the first of a series of volumes which will cover the period from the close of the Revolution to the '30's of the 19th century.
He,"intends to deal with the territory which lies between the Allegheny Mountains and the Mis- sissippi river, the mo.-^t significant of the frontiers as far as the westward expansion of the American churcbea is concerned. This first volume deals with the Baptists, and tells entertain- ingly of the early .\merican whoopee which took the form of revivals. Procee<ling to a later period in American history, we find ""ConsM-ien- tiouH Objeclors in the Civil"

He,"traces the steps taken by the groups of re- ligious objectors to cope with the situntion created by the calls for troops in the North and South, and describes their claims for exemption, memorials to the authorities, and the experiences of individual objectors. Religious objectors were exempt*^! In the World"

Baby,Bisons will wind up their fhort 1J>31 ciimpaign Saturday
when,"they engage Penn State's yearlings at Ixximis field. Although the .sea- son has not been a great success, the freshmen are better than thfir .scores would indicate, and, with"
any,"break in luck, should take the Lion frosh into camp, Heydrich will probaVdy receive th hurling assignment for the JJ^usser- men. ""Irv"" has been pitching good ball of late, but poor fielding by hin tfam-mates has ruined his efforts Ruch will be the other part of the lottery, having shown himself to b^ fully capable <>f performing the catching duties. Coach Mussel has worked durintf the past week to iron out the rough *pots, so the freshmen .should be at their besJt for this contest."
No,doubt the frosh will try to be in top-notch condition in order to complete their Feason in approved style. Coach Snavely's tossers will en- deavor to improve their winning column tomorrow and Saturday
when,they meet Juniata and Penn State in their last trip of the current season.
The,"team has not been very success- ful this year, and two victories this week-end will help materially in keeping the campaign from being a total wash-out. Juniata has al.<<o had a rather poor -eason, and the Bisons .should uin at Huntingdon. ""Nick"""
Kenny,will probably take the
mound,"for Buck- nell, since Trudnak will in all prob- ability be kept fresh for the Nittany Lion.s. The Penn State outfit has had an indifTerent ye^r, and prospects for a victory at State College are good. Bucknell's"
team,"seems to have im- proved in the last three games. Hold- ing Albright to a close score, as the Bi.xons did Saturday, is no little feat, since the Reading aggregation is reputed to have one of the b<<st east- ern inter-collegiate teams."
The,
game,"did show that Bucknell's bat- ting punch is still missing, and if the teams expects to take the games this week-end, it will have to improve Its stick work. enny for Bucknell, were the slug- gers of the game, each securing two hit.<<."

DR.,
HUNT,
RETIRES,
On,CommencL-ment
Day,th*- re.'^iK- iiation of the
man,
who,"ha.-* led Buck- nell through twelve of its nioi<t event- ful years will take effect. It iy with real regret that The Biitknelliaii views Dr. Hunt's retirement, and this sentiment is doubtless that of the faculty, the administration, alumni, and all friends of the university The faculty's regard for Dr. Hunt was partially expressed by the pre- sentation of a medal to him this eve- ning; the esteem in which he is held by undergraduates and :ilumni can- not be expres.-(ed in so concrete a fashion, but every"
man,or
woman,
who,ha.s been a Bucknell student in the pa.st twelve years will testify that no president could have had greater respect ;ind admiration than Dr. Hunt. It is difficult for students fully to realize what Pr. Hunt ha.< done fur Bucknell.
The,difficulties are tho.--e i which arise when an attempt is
made,"to evaluate any period of history j without waiting for the passing of | time to lend the proper perspective, j However, a better idea of the great | value of Di . Hunt's services will bt^ | had when the information containe.l in ""Memorials of Bucknell,"" a historv of the university for the past decade which will b<<' piiibli.she<l on Com- mencement Day, is"
made,"known. Di-, Hunt came to Bucknell during! the critical post-war period"
--,"critical because the rapid expan.-ion of the ^ university, an expansion"
common,to j all in.stitutions of higher leaitiing af- j ter the war
--,was just starting to take place. Serious problems that never before confronted a Bucknell presi- dent had to l>e met and solved. Pre.':- sure brought to bear by
many,diver- sified interests
was,"great, and it took an excutive with boundless patience and acute insight to maintain hai mony. I Dr. Hunt .saw to it that BuckneH'.- growth was along the lines that the founders laid"
down,
--,"thoughtless ex-i pansion might have been mere mush- room growth, perishing in a short time, and hit-or-miss development might have resulted in just a second- Tste college. It took careful plan- ning and expert guidance to see that Bucknell's growth wa.> straight and true in an upward direction. Thus it can truthfully he said that"
Dr,Hunt is principally responsible for the better Bucknell of today.
May,"he carry into private life the realization that his .sacrifices are ap- preciated, even though Bucknell's debt to"
him,"is so great that it never can be fully paid. J.

Tau,Delta play was not as well re- ceived as the other two. This
was,"not due to the authors, nor to the I c>>st, but was the fault of the :iudi- I ence.

It was a serious drama, revealing the been at- t;iined this year. The drapes gava the setting an effec-t of vastness, totally in keeping with the atmos- phere"" of this play. Not possessing very"
