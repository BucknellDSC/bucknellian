The idea of breaking the fresh-
man class up into many smaller
groups was initiated the year be-
fore last so that the entire orienta-
tion experience would be more
meaningful to the freshmen. Also
initiated that year was the idea of
the freshmen taking part in the
program instead of just listening
to lectures.

One deletion of last year’s pro-
gram is the English Qualifying
exam, given by the English De-
partment, for those freshmen enter-

Hall Directors

Urge Campus Communication

By ERIC RIESS

“We are in the business of doing
what we can for people to allow
them to sort of do their own
thing.’ With this premise Miss
Judith A. Judy is beginning her
first year as director of Univer-
sity Residence Halls.

Miss Judy replaces Miss
Suzanne K. Herman, who has been
named Assistant Dean of Studants
at Lafayette College, She went on
to add that, ‘the biggest obstacle
to this end seems to be artificial
barriers that arise between the
students and their resident as-
sistants (R. A.’s) and between the
R. A.’s and the professionals or
administrators.”

Miss Judy emphasized that com-
munication is the only way that
“the neccessary” feeling of trust
and countenance can be establish-
ed between students, R. A.’s and

administrators.

The new director formerly served
as a residence hall director at
Illinois State University in Nodm
Ill. and will work closely w
Leonard P. Smolen who was named
associate director when the Office
of University Residence halls was
created last year.

When asked about the difficul-
ties she has encountered in her
new job, Miss Judy stated, “de
spite of the switch to coed living
and the fact that some sophomore
men will be living in makeshift
quarters, we haven’t had any ma
jor difficulties. My major problem
has been getting myself adjusted
to the surroundi and meeting
the people that I'll be working
with.”

handling student problems, recent-

Faculty Group Presents
New University Senate

By ERIC RIESS

The University faculty will meet
in special session Monday at 7:30
p.m. in Coleman Hall Auditorium
to discuss a new proposal for the
reorganization of the University’s
governance procedure.

The proposal entitled, Proposal
For A University Senate, was pre-
pared over the summer months by
a special faculty committee ap-
pointed last May. Dr. John A. Pe-
eler, professor of Political science,
Dr. Ralph Spielman, professor of
sociology, Dr. Edward Stiano, pro-
fessor of Computer Science and Dr.
Charles Walker, professor of elec-
trical engineering were appointed
at the final University faculty
meeting last year.

At that meeting the faculty de-
feated another model for a Uni-
versity Senate prepared by a fa-
culty governance Committee. That
proposal was the subject of debate
in the faculty since it was released
last February.

After the first Senate model
failed to receive the necessary two-
thirds majority by an 80-54 vote the
faculty decided to continue their
attempt to restructure the govern-
ance by appointing the new com-
mittee.

In a cover letter with the new
proposal, Dr. Spielman, speaking
for the committee says, ‘You will
note that the proposal is not a
mere compromise of old positions
but includes innovations that make
it a new proposition requiring a
new judgement.

In a personal interview Dr. Speil
man emphasised this view saying,
“this is not a rehash of the old
Senate model, it is new, and must
be considered in that light.”

Along with the proposal for the
Senate are recommendations for

staff members and anyone in-
terested in working on the paper
this year are asked to attend.

necessary revisions in the structure
of the faculty committee system.
These suggestions are not part of
the proposal but are necessary to
provide for the smooth function-
ing of the Senate if it is adopted.

Spielman commented, ‘‘this is
only a proposal that we are pre-
senting to the faculty. We hope to
encourage debate to improve the
document wherever possible, be-
fore final action is taken.

Congress Outlines Program for Coming Year

ABS Discusses Elections

By SUSAN PRESTON

The upcoming elections of living
unit representatives and sugges-
tions of concentration for the com-
ing year were the topics of Wednes-
day night’s Association of Bucknell
Students meeting

Craig Eby, ABS vice-president,
began the meeting by explaining
the election procedure to the pres-
ent members, who visited upper-
class hall groups and fraternity

houses last night to solicit candi-
dates.

Each living unit i. dormitory
or fraternity house, will elect a
certain number of representatives
based on the number of students
in that unit, to serve on the ABS
for one year. Students interested
in running will contact the Resi-
dent Director of their dorm or the
Dean of Student Affairs Office of
the Assistant Dean of Fraternity

Experimental College Organizes Plans;
Interim Board Forms Future Activities

By JAN WILLIAMS

The Interim Beard of the Ex-
perimental College today announc-
ed its plans for the future of the
Experimental College in letters
sent to the entire university com-
munity. The letters state plans for
holding another Experimental Col-
lege this January, and for the for-
mation of an official Experimental
College Board.

The January Experimental Col-
lege will be generally conducted
along the same lines as was the
first perimental College last
January However, the Interim
Board stresses that this is not an
exact replica of the first Experi-
mental College, since the nature
of a college of this sort depends

“entirely on its members.”

A meeting of all students and
faculty interested in being mem-
bers of the January Experimental
College will be held September 20
in Coleman 102A at 8:00 p.m.

Members of the university com-
munity can read the prospects for
the January Experimental College,
in the reserve room or student
lounge of the library or by con-
tacting any member of the Interim
Board.

The Experimental College Board
is being created to officially take
over all future planning and ac-
tivities concerning the Experi-
mental College here. Four faculty
members and four students will be
chosen for the Board.

Inter-departmental Program

Report Offers New Arts Major

The creation of an Interdepart-
mental Major in the bachelor of
arts program was the major order
of business at the College of Arts
and Science’s first faculty meeting,
Wednesday.

The program, similar to the one
already in effect for bachelor of
science majors, was proposed by
the curriculum committee, “In

Sweet Memories

By TERRY ELLIS
Tomorrow the Class of 1971 will

‘ have one of its last chances to re-

live the past during “Old Sweet
Shop Day.”

Only seniors will actually re-
member “The thrill of . . . the
first Sweet Shop date,” as quoted
by their freshman directory, but
the remainder of the campus will
have a unique opportunity to attach
their own interpretation upon a
past tradition.

The Sweet Shop was, until 1968,
the campus hangout, although fi-
nancially independent of the Uni-
versity. It featured an escape from
the cafeterias through regular meal
plans and a variety of foods.

One specialty, the Clydeburger,

was named after the Sweet Shop
owner, Clyde Kirkland, who retired
in 1968. At that time, the brothers
of Theta Delta Chi purchased The
Sweet Shop for their house and
have since revived its old tradi-
tions to raise money for various
charities.

This year, in conjunction with
Phi Mu Sorority, TDX has chosen
the medical ship U.S.S. Hope as
their charity with profits and do-
nations going toward this fund.
From 11 a.m. until 1 a.m. students
may order such items as pizzas,
hoagies, Clydeburgers, and sun-
daes while listening to ‘oldies from
the jukebox’ as they revive the
past in order to help the present
during Old Sweet Shop Day.

order to better serve those stu-
dents who seek to concentrate in
areas which transcend depart-
mental lines,” according to the
committee prologue to the recom-
mendation.

In order to take part in the pro-
gram, the student must consult
first with the chairman of the de-
partment where he will be taking
the most courses as well as the
other department chairman involv-
ed to develope a proposal.

The proposal will consist of a
topic statement, a detailed list of
courses to be taken, a statement
of reason by the student, and a
statement by the cooperating fac-
ulty members that they have re-
viewed and approved the students
program.

The proposal will then be taken
before a committee on Interdepart-
mental Majors, composed of elect-
ed faculty members. The commit-
tee will review all proposals, as
well as provide advice for continu-
ation and evaluation of the pro-
gram.

The committee will report to the
Curriculum committee every two
years.

In other orders of business the
Arts and Science faculty author-
ized the creation of a major in
classics. Previously the classics
department could only offer de-
grees in Latin or Greek. Now the
department will offer a classics
major with the possibility of con-
centration in Greek, Latin, or
classical civilization.

The faculty also provided for the
organization of a freshman advisor
seminar committee, composed of
three faculty members and two
students.

The committee will take over or-
ganization of the freshman advisor
seminar program instituted this
year. All members of the com-
mittee will be elected by methods
established by the ABS or Faculty.

In a final move the faculty voted
to reorganize the structure of the
Curriculum Committee.

Students must submit an apr
plication of their own creation, ex-
pressing their reaction to the idea
of the Experimental College and
their views on the future of Experi-
mental College. Both students and
professors must be interviewed by
several members of the Interim
Board.

All applicants should familiarize
themselves with the evaluation of
the first Experimental College, en-
titled Structures of Learning: A
Fundamental Enquiry into Bucknell
Education and the Bucknell Ex
perimental College. The ev aluation
may be obtained from the reserve
room or student lounge of the li-
brary, or any member of the In-
terim Board

The Experimental College has
gone through various stages of de-
velopment since the Academic Ad-
visory Committee fir presented
the perspectus in May, 1969.

Members of the College were se-
lected, and the actual experiment
started with the first organiza-
tional meeting of the community
in October, 1969. Throughout all of
the planning during the first se-
mester of last year, as well as the
actual living situation in the SAE
house in January, the experiment
was officially in motion.

During the second semester, a
course sponsored by the depart-
ments of psychology and educa-
tion did the evaluation of the ex-
periment. It was printed in May,
1970.

Since the evaluation strongly rec-
ommended that the idea of the Ex-
perimental College should definite-
ly be continued a group of students

Men by Monday and a preliminary
slate will be drawn up Tuesday.

Primary elections will be held
Monday, September 21. Final elec-
tions are slated for Monday Sept-
ember 28 from 7-9 p.m.

Off-campus students w elect
their representatives by mail ballot
and representatives from the fresh-
man dorms will be elected in early
October.

The representation on ABS is be-
ing increased from 14 to 31. At
present the membership includes
the 5 officers elected in March, 5
at-large members elected last
April, and the 4 class presidents,
ABS hopes that the increased mem-
bership will strengthen communi-
cation between the ABS and the
student body and make the ABS an
effective voice of student opinion.

The remainder of the meeting
was conducted informally with the
members discussing areas needing
consideration by the ABS this year.
A suggestion was made that the
ABS set up a “hotline” telephone
system which would enable a stu-
dent to procure information on who
to contact about any subject from
drug information to who to call
about getting a refrigerator.

They also hope to range a
meeting with town officials to dis-
cuss the Universit relationship

Senior Class Plans
Reunion Gift Drive

By LAURIE BUTCHER

The past two years heve seen a
change in scope of the traditional
senior class gift here.

Instead of simply collecting
money to buy benches or a mem-
orial gateway, the Classes of ‘69
and ’70 plegded yearly contribu-
tions to a fund which would be in-
vested by a committee formed of
members of their respective clas:

that time, will be a considerable
sum for the University.

Center Construction
Progresses Rapidly

By NANCY GRDEN

The construction of three build-
ings on and near the University
campus has progressed ra idly
over the summer. The University
Center is scheduled for completion
in September 1971, with the new
Sigma Alpha house and the added
wing on the Tau Kappa Epsilon
house scheduled for use in the
next few weeks.

According to Walter C. Geiger,
chief engineer of the construction
of the Center, the construction of
the building is about on schedule.
The brick and stone work on the
front of the building which faces
Seventh Street House, is 100%
completed. Within the next two
weeks, the finished roof will be
constructed. The concrete work
for the flaws has been done, and
the instal’< ‘on of heating, electri-
cal conduh ir conditioning units,
and other ‘& ‘facilities in now in
progress. %,

The kitchen\ ‘ties are sched-
uled to arrive around October 1,
and they will be installed through
November. Also, by the end of

November, the exte
should be finished.

The driveway is up to its per-
manent elevation in order to tie in
with the entrances to the building,
The sidewalk is presently lower
than the driveway, but it will later
be raised to its permanent level.
The final grading is not done, but
some of the work on the rough
grading has been started

The added wing of the TKE house
and the new SAM house are both
scheduled for use by the end of
September.

All of the facilities in TKE’s new
wing are installed, except for the
enlarged party room downstairs,
which is scheduled for completion
by September 19. Landscaping will
be done at a later date. There are
45 brothers now living in the house,
15 of which live in the new wing.

SAM expects to sleep 16 of its
brothers in the house before the
end of the month. Several weeks
later the dining facilities should be
in readiness, and the recreation
facilities should be completed three
of weeks later, in November.

A Campaign in the Spring

By JACK SCHMIDT

It had been a long, hot June day. As I got out of my car early
that evening, I felt myself wanting to sprint into headquarters to see
how we had done. But I held myself back, walking slowly, thinking
back over the past few weeks’ hoping for the best...

It seemed that people were inning to listen, and that a grass-roots
campaign might just have a ct e of succeeding. People began realiz
ing that they were goings ea real choice between candidates, and
it seemed that many voters would even go to the polls to make that

choice.

As the weeks went by, the student ranks swelled. Rutgers and Doug-
lass students began to work at nine and would finish in the late evening.
Students from other schools, whose homes were in the district, began
working soon after unpacking their bags. High school students manned
the twenty phones, calling strange homes, trying to get out the vote on
June 2. House wives were calling friends, and soon the search began for
poll watchers and baby sitters.

And we thought we had a real chance. We even began to talk about
getting together again in the fall for the general elections. On primary
day two busloads of volunteers arrived for the day from New York, all
veterans of past Lindsay campaigns, and now working for candidates
with names like Eikenberry and Abzug, and for state senators I can’t
even remember. They had all given up a day for a man they had hardly
ever heard of but had been told was on “the right side.’’

“New Jersey Must Do Better
Lew KADEN for CONGRESS”

. But as I rounded the corner that night I looked anxiously at
some familiar faces, I could see that we had lost. And we had lost badly,
by a two to one margin, winning only three towns in the whole district.

Although we had received as many votes as we had thought we had
needed for a win, the heaviest voter turn-out in ten years had swelled
the Patten vote. In canvassing the entire districe, we had at least
sparked interest in many more voters although we had not actually con-
vinced them to vote for our candidate. People had decided to vote for
the incumbent, but for the first time, they had been forced to confront
issues in a primary election.

Although Lew had lost badly, his student workers had done well
in their own right. Most people were interested in what we had had to
say, and were quite surprised that we were giving up so much of our
personal time to work for something we believed in We were really work-
ing for a cause, rather than a candidate; we were working for peace
through democratic means. We were going out and talking with people,
telling them their vote really did count, and asking them to listen to
what we believed in and what our candidates stood for. Although we
didn’t win, we were listened to, not despised and shouted down.

The people all hand an opportunity to vote in this election, those who
took advantage of their right chose to vote for the incumbent by a large
margin. But the power was there for all those who wanted to use it. We
won a small victory in that we had begun to work at a personal level.
If we hadn’t won, we at least had brought an unknown peace candidate
and his views much closer to the people he was seeking to represent,
People had begun to listen. If change is to come in this nation, it must
come on a personal level. The campaign showed that a new idea and a
new candidate has a real chance if people are willing to work for what
they believe. We didn’t win, but we were heard and listened to. And
we'll be back.

An experimental, ‘write your own” insert will be newly featured in
The Bucknellian this semester. On the assumption that there are groups
of people who feel that the “establishment” newspaper cannot meet
their needs, The Bucknellian is seeking to afford them an opportunity
to create their own.

The cost of a two-page insert, The Bucknellian’s newspaper facilities
and expertise will all be available to an interested group once a month.

Groups that make application for these services will be asked to
present The Bucknellian a general outline of their proposed project by
the middle of each month. As this is an experiment in the people’s fre-
edom of the p the priorities for consideration of competing proposals
will be established and published when proposals are in-hand.

The deadline for submitting proposals for the first experimental pub-
lication is September 18. Those interested are asked to contact Paul
Osher at 1263 or at The Bucknellian office, 523-4221

THE SIDESHOW

Tradition

By DAVID WEINBERGER

Many of you are Freshmen, too young and too immature to under-
stand the meaning of a breakdown of tradition, but you can trust your
elder upperclassmen when they tell you it is happening to you here and
now. The Freshmen are running around like mold in an old cheese store.
And it’s time something was done about it.

First of all, and most of all, the women must be moved from Roberts
Hall. It brings a soft tear to the hard eye to think of all those girls
showering under faucets that once spiritized such B. U. football greats
as Russel Muscle and Roger Crashlodger. It brings moisture to the lips
to think of all those women running around the halls of that esteemed
building with their soft little bodies clad in less material than needed
to make the stars on the colonial flag (God bless it!).

This is what we mean by “lack of tradition”. One’s identity is all
of one’s past actions. Although he is nasty today, for example, his
identity is not nasty because in the past he has been more often nice
than rotten. In the same way, the identity of a people or college de-
pends on its past. The identity of Roberts Hall is male and can never
be female. Oh, sure it can be temporarily inhabited by females, but
so can jockey shorts and jockey shorts will forever be male (it is
comforting to know that some things just never change.

But meanwhile, an identity crisis is beimg forced on our buildings.
What is Roberts Hall to think? Was Roberts ever consulted? No, a
lynch mob of crazed students and administrators castrated it. Bear in
mind that this was no Myra Breckinridge sex operation but a brutal
and savage ripping at the very masculinity of established institutions.

Perhaps this will give some clue as to why our buildings are acting
so sluggishly. The corridors seem to squeak a little more, the faucets
dribble instead of gush. Some might say that this is due to nothing
more than advancing age, but any competent doctor will tell you that
the Will to Live is the most important component of our survival kits.
Take that away and a leaf turns to brown, a grape into a rasin.

A word about these two phenomena is necessary. The leaves turn
brown in autum to maintain their free will in the face of their realization
that the winter will inevitably come anyway and will turn them brown.
The grapes, however, have for the past few years conscientiously re-
fused to turn into grapes to support the grape boycott. The grapes knew
that if they turned into rasins many would eat them, not aware that
California rasins were also being boycotted, and so the path of grapes
was clear. You'll never find a strike-breaker grape. This year, now that
the strike is over, we can expect to see many tired grapes relinquish
their grips on juiciness and head into that bowl of bran flakes waiting
for us all.

And that should be a lesson to us all. If only we had the wisdom of

members of the University com-
munity to engage in activities ad-
dressed to our national crisis.’ The
faculty and the student leaders of
the strike emphasized that it was
a strike WITH the University
rather than against it... . The
student resolution calls for: im-
mediate withdrawal of U. S. troops
from Cambodia and Laos, perma-
nent cessation of bombing of North
Vietnam, and withdrawal of troops
from Southeast Asia by Decem-
ber.”

It is not difficult to find students
who believe themselves superior in
wisdom and knowledge to the Com-
mander-in-Chief, his cabinet of-
ficers, and the high ranking pro-
fessionals charged with America’s
security. The gravity with which
adolescents undertake to provide
instant ions to international
problems baffling the most experi-
enced of men, becomes a source of
humor to themselves when they
grow older. (At 17 I published an

ticle entitled ‘‘The Riddle of the
Universe,” which dissipated the
riddle in 1,000 words-)

But maturity —or at least post-
adolescense — expected of fa-
culty members. For them to “‘su-
spend normal academic functions
to enable the members of the Uni-
versity community to engage in ac-
tivities addressed to our national
crisis,” is as arrogant in attitude
as it is pompus and sophomoric in
language.

This is the behavior of a pseudo-
intellectual lynch mob enforcing
conformity by strangling dissent.
It silences dissenters by ignoring
the very existence of their point of
view. It extinguishes the right of a
student even to be non-involved —
to attend classes instead of playing
international politics. It says with
the brutal directness of a totali-
tarian ‘‘people’s” (slave) state:
“Not only may you not disagree;
you MUST AGREE!”

In condoning such faculty action,
Bucknell abdicates its function as
an institution of enlightenment and
becomes an instrument of crowd
tyranny. While it continues thus to
distort the purpose for which it was
founded, I must refuse to raise
money for — or to give money to—
an Alma Mater of which I have be-
come ashamed.

Thundering Herd Hastens
Toward Long Hard Season

By BOB WENDEL

As the University begins a new
year, the average college student
immediately has thoughts of the
“big game,” but judging from this
year’s football schedule, that game
probably will never occur.

One football rating organization
has chosen the BU Bisons to lose
nine of its ten games, with the one

remaining contest, against Temple
on September 19 in the season’s
opener, to be a ‘‘toss-up.”’

Although pegged to lose nine
games, the point spreads in these
contests are not large, making way
for some really exciting battles.

The biggest reason for the sea-
son’s rather dim outlook can be
contributed to the schedule. Pren-
der’s squad has two games with
tough Southern teams: Davidson
and The Citadel.

The Citadel, a military school,
has had good football for a number
of years, and is a possible confer-
ence champion

No one will ever forget the Wit-
tenberg game, played here last
year for Parent’s Weekend. This
year’s opponent from the Ohio con-
ference is Baldwin-Wallace instead,
which is the team which yearly
fights it out with Wittenberg for
their conference title.

Although the MAC no longer ex-
ists as a football conference, the
schedule has retained the usual
MAC rivals. Heading the list are
Delaware and Lehigh, both of
whom beat the Thundering Herd
last year, and figure to be stronger
this year.

Finishing up
Rutgers

house

With all this power lined up
against the Herd, it would seem
quite a task for the Bisons to put
up a good showing. However,
Coach Fred Prender is optimistic.

“The guys are in the best po:
sible shape they could be in phy
ically. My staff and I are now
working on the mental readines
of the club.”

“‘We feel we have a much better
ball team than at this time last
year, and we’ve had very few in-
juries.”

The three boys who have been

injured are all sophomores and all
have had leg problems. Roy
Churchman and Rich Zentd both
required operations on their knees,
and will be out for the season.
Gerry Solomon should be back in
the line-up shortly.

How well the team will actually
do still remains to be seen. Praac-
tice this year has been limited due
to early matriculation, and the 50
man squad is smaller than last
years.

However, Coach Prender feels
that he has, “the nucleus of a very
good football team; they are big-
ger, quicker, more dedicated, and
more mature than last year’s
squad. If we get a few breaks, and
stay healthy, we are going to upset
a few teams.”

Concerning this years probable

One wonders in this same vein
whether The Herd will follow the
lead of the Fighting Irish and de-

accepting a bowl bid.

We feel certain that when and if
the opportunity presented itself
for the Bison gridmen to journey to
a post season tilt, the sophistication
of the BU organization would be
put to the test.

John Newman at the halfback

On defense, four familiar names
are indicative of a strong return-
ing attack. Tarras Onishencko and
C. B. Mansfield will be holding
down two of the linebacker spots,
while Gene Depew on the line and
Gene Lucarelli at safety round out
the quartet.

Last evening, in a closed scrim-
mage, the Bisons showed a rather
potent offensive attack, as they
scored four times. Two of the tal-
lies came on long pass plays,
while the other two were short runs.
Looking extremely tough on of-
fense were end, Bob Ciperson, and
fullback Mitch Farbstein.

‘As far as cross-country is concerned, Gulden says that he will carry
every one that comes out. The only harriers who will be cut are those
who cut themselves by not coming to practice. In return, all men who
stay on the team will compete in the five meets this season. In the case
of meets where the team size is limited a second team will be entered

This replacement of the mascot
is necessary for two reasons. First,
Penn State has a lion, and second,
we are cetain that the current mas-
cot would be distracted by the
halftime entertainment. It would
be unseemly to have a mascot dro-

Another deficit that would have
to be remedied would be the hel-

We think it would be clever to in-

helmets. Our first thought was
that a buckeye flower would be

This summer has been an eventful one for Bucknell athletics. It
saw the end of the highly successful coaching career of Henry Peters
when he collapsed at a tennis match in August. It also saw the beginning
of two new coaching careers at Bucknell with the appearances of Richard
Schumacher and Arthur Gulden.

With the passing of Hank Peters, Bucknell lost a venerable, colorful
coach. Not only did he compile a magnificent won-lost record during
his coaching years, he astablished that elusive winning tradition
tennis. Coach Peters supervised 158 wins while sustaining just 126 de.
feats in building that tradition, Last year’s team was undefeated in 14 9
matches and brought home a second consecutive MAC championship,
With this type of tradition, his successor, Craig Reynolds, will have an
easier job recruiting and maintaining the quality of tennis at Bucknell,

Arthur Gulden will assume the responsibilities of track and cross.
country. He comes to BU after coaching the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers in
these two sports for the past three years.

Coach Gulden started practice for the 5-meet cross-country schedule
on Wednesday and promises to hold work-outs for track and field men
beginning in the next couple of weeks.

Gulden sees lots of promise in the material he has to work with and
expects to develop a significant track program at BU. He says the work.
outs this fall ‘‘will be non-competitive in nature, to work on fundamentals
and to have fun.”’ Later on in the winter meets will be scheduled to test

The second new addition to the coaching staff is Richard Schu- #
macher, who will handle the matmen this winter. Schumacher is a re-
cent graduate of East Stroudsburg State where he put together an im-
pressive collegiate heavyweight wrestling career. His overall record
was 60-2-1. He won in the Pennsylvania conference three times, and

s AA college division heavyweight champ.
This type of performance earned him All-American status in 1968 and
1970. Schumacher finished fifth in an effort to represent the US in
the ’68 Olympics.

Coach Schumacher insists that wrestling was his least favorite
sport when he entered college, but the opportunity to wrestle on one
of the best teams in the country soon changed his mind.

The new coach is convinced that he can build a successful wrestling
team at BU. A proponent of conditioning he asserts “that half the
matches can be won by conditioning alone” if the wrestler is mediocre
with respect to his other skills. é

Schumacher also believes that a variety of intricate moves are
unnecessary to make a successful wrestler. If a man knows three or
four moves well and can set them up effectively, he will win most
of his matches. He says this was the philosophy that carried him to
his showing in the Olympic trials.

With his eyes on the future, Coach Schumacher has tabs on a
number of high school grapplers who would be able to make a big “
contribution to BU wrestling.

So, it looks as though the Bisons have managed to procure two
coaches who will greatly aid the Thundering Herd in the contests to

Schmidt Takes Post
As Associate Editor

By ELAINE WALLOS

In an attempt to inchease the
scope and relevance of The Buck-
nellian’s editorial page, the edi-
torial board and its policy are now
in process of being completely re-
vampel

Jack Schmidt, a junior who has
been involved with the newspaper
in various capacities in the past
two years, has been named as-
sociate editor. He is assuming the
position previously held by Heddy
Matthias.

The duties of associate editor in-
clude heading the editorial board.
which determines the editorial
policy of the paper.

Another change which has been
implemented this semester con-
cerns the requirements for mem-
bership on the editorial board. In
the past, this membership was
drawn from The Bucknellian staff
of editors.

Membership is now open to any-
one who indicates his interest by
attendance at three meetings as a
non-voting member and by submis-
sion of one editorial

It is hoped that the open-editor-
ial-board policy and the greater
number of people involved will re-
sult in a broader e for interest-
ing, relevant editorials.

In an interview Schmidt com-
mented, “I think there has been a
problem of creditability on the edi-
torial board, and we will seek to
increase the information bank from
which we work’ Seventeen people
showed interest by attending a pre-
liminary editorial board meeting
Sunday night:

Schmidt considers more investi
gative work an absolute necessity
for the new board Editorials will
be based on original research,
rather than merely reaction to
news stories. Their scope will also
be expanded to include national
and world events as opposed to the
ABS orientation of the past.

All editorial board meetings will
be held at 6:30 Friday evening in

New Dorm Pit. Any member of the
university community is welcome
to attend and express his opinions.
One additional change of policy
this semester will result in the ex-
clusion of events listed on the uni-
versity campus calendar from
“Happenings of Note.”

The rap sessions will be offset
by more structured activities, such
as workshops. In some ¢.
workshops will involve phy:

workshop involving the practice of
the basic Hatha Yoga principles.

Four Major Dramas

By EUE BOLSTRUM

The university community can
anticipate a busy season in drama
this year.

Beginning with The Alchemist by
Ben Jonson Cap & Dagger will
stage four major productions, in-
cluding the Serpent by J. C. Van-
Itallie, The Trojan Women by Euri-
pides, and The Glass Menagerie by
Tennessee Williams

Besides its major productions,
the theatrical group will continue
the Cocktail Theatre series and
will perform two Children’s plays.

Although the major plays are
selected by faculty and Theta

Fifth Trax Vacated
Smolen Announces Housing Crisis End

By NICKI DREW

The housing crisis which forced
thirty-two students to spend their
first two weeks in open rooms on
Trax’s fifth floor is now over, ac-
cording to Leonard Smolen, Assis
tant Director of University Resi-
dence Halls. As of yesterday,
rooms have been made available to
all undergraduate students.

This announcement follows sev-
eral months of work by the resi-
dence hall staff to find adequate
housing facilities for an excep-
tionally large freshman class. After
reactivating previously unused
rooms, such as lounges, and trans-
forming singles into doubles, the
staff still found itself with thirty-
two sophomores without rooms.

During the summer, these stu-
dents received a letter informing
them that they would be living in
temporary quarters for the first
two weeks of the semester. Upon
arrival, they were placed in fifth
Trax until rooms could be found
for them in areas vacated by other
students, fraternity houses, and off-

campus rooms and apartments.

Thirteen sophomores were
housed on the second floor of Judd
House, a small house on University
Avenue across from the University
Cafeteria. The remaining six are
living in enclosed rooms on fifth
Trax and will be moved as soon
as better facilities become avail-
able.

Panhell Announces

and will be designated informal

man Carol Garbarino has placed

Referring to the interview with
the residence of fifth Trax publish-
ed in the September 11th issue of
The Bucknellian, Smolen noted
that the article semed to stress a
lack of interest by the housing
staff. He attributed this to the
unfortunate timing of the inter-
view, which took place over Labor
Day weekend. The staff, he ex-
plained, was unable to do anything
until those students who registered
late returned to their rooms.

During the past week, Smolen
met with these students daily and
housed several of them each day.
In the meantime, they were made
as comfortable as possible under
difficult circumstances. But the
two week commitment was met.

“If people would stop and look
at other campuses’ housing prob-
lems,” claims Mr. Smolen, “‘they
would see htat Bucknell is not
alone in its housing crisis.”’ Lafay-
ette, for example, was forced to
place students in rented trailers,
which was considered here, but re-

GUEST COLUMN

Nest Fouling

By RICK VANCE

Ignoring the new concrete complex of smokestacked progress, he
turned onto Meadowlark Road and drove rapidly toward the utopian
merging of waters. Eight years. The return. The Panglossian rebirth
of a boyhood. His mind lingered on the memory of mirrored water
bursting with life, bubbling unerringly, endlessly into the welcoming
ebb of its larger, swifter companion, Pine River. Summer. Rafting,
Camping. The majestic mixing of gurgling water and little boys’ half-
hushed voices accompanied by a raw, frightening, forestal symphony.
The sunny relief of morning with its aroma of fresh, fried trout swim-
ming in butter. Fresh. Freshness. What was it that Wordsworth had
said? The freshness of a dream . . . and something about the earth’s
seeming apparelled in celestrial light .

He reached the bridge, shut off the ignition, and stepped out of the
the car. Noting the disappointing treelessness, he descended the sloping
brown bank of decayed grass and began following the creek, expecting
it to blossom suddenly, shockingly into the wreckless, raging challenge
that had once stubbornly refused waded crossing to all. He recalled its
rigid impartiality, how it had tripped his girfriend and how her fall had
caused his. Then they laughed and held each other tightly, defying the
water’s cold by generating their own warmth. He was sixteen at the

. A decade. One-seventh of his life. Could it have passed

He continued walking, kicking aside strewn remnants of man’s mas-
sive intrusion. Beer cans and paper. No-deposit and plastic made im-
mortal by the genius of its inventor. Where was the dense, verdant
foilage? And the fish, were they still there, hiding desparately some-
where beneath the crawling murkiness? He caught a darting glimpse
wildlife: rats. Wildlife or civilized life? The unthinking,
beneficiaries of man’s nest fouling, destined to outlive their
y htless providers. Stagnation. A sign extending from amidst
a debried earth into the vastness of space. UNIVERSAL DUMP. Death.
The e ction of extinctors

He quickened his pace, conscious of the roar of nearby generators
and noted the ironic spectre of murderous, hand-saving detergent suds.

1e killers. Chain breakers. He envisioned an advertisement: Don’t die

hands. Buy Sexo Suds today . .
, standing to the left of the once awesome jointure
across the river and observed the new milennia of like
s then shifted his gaze to the black horror of belched carbon drift-
g across the sky, awaiting an opportunity to vent its choking revenge.
He hesitated then looked down at the line merging. Puke puking its puke
into puke. A boyhood dissolved in the finale of his stomach-turning ordeal.
He turned and ran, fleeing against time to the futureless fantasy of an
apathetic now. He would get away. He would go to his cabin in the
mountains only thirty minutes away from his new home. That would

always be there. Always.

From the Editor's Desk

With the possible exception of a few Tibetan ascetics all men,
by now, have viewed the movie ‘“Z.”’ The time has therefore ar-
rived to question the authenticity of the events depicted therein.
And so a brief sketch is here given the historical events upon which
the movie was based.

In 1963 Grigoros Lambrakis, a leftist deputy in Greece. was
murdered as depicted by thugs hired by the police. The incident
occurred in Salonica. Subsequently the murderers received light
sentences and the six policemen associated with the act were ac-
quitted. The incident, however, was not an immediate catalyst for
the ascension of the junta led by George Papadopoulos, as the film
suggests, but rather aided. George Papandreol in outstanding con-
servative administration of Karamanus,

As for Christos Sartzitakis, the actual prosecuter, he received
a judgeship for his comprehensive investigation. (But when the
colonels finally did assume power, he was one of thirty judges to
be dismissed. This occurred some five years after the murder).

As a final note, the colonels later not only reinstated the six
police officers earlier dismissed, but promoted them before retiring
them with pension.

azine. 8-17-70.

A Recommendation
To the editor,

I call to the attention of your
readers the forthcoming Campus
Theatre showing of the movie
“Patton.” At a time when the
armed forces are increasingly the
subject of passionate polemic, this
movie is a must; it depicts a way
of life which has stood for many
men as an ideal. The movie is,
in my estimation, objective; it can
and does speak to people of all
ideological persuasions. In addi-
tion, I find it to be a substantial
artistic achievement. To quote
Miss Judith Christ, I recommend

atton’’ ‘‘without reservation.”

Sincerely.
William J. Mates, ‘71

CAF

The Congressional Action Fund
is a non-partisan, non-profit organ-
ization which, as an affiliate of the
National Coalition for a Respon-
sible Congress, has accepted re-
sponsibility for conducting a major
fund-raising effort on college cam-
puses across the country. CAF’s
national campus goal is to raise
one million dollars for distribution
to peace and new priorities candi-
dates for Congress.

CAF’s Board will soon be nomi-
nating for funding support approxi-
mately forty candidates who share
the Fund’s commitment to a
nificant reordering of national pri-
orities. The CAF’s goals include
withdrawal of all combat and com-
bat-support troops from Southeast
Asia by March 1971. a reduction in
military exf itures by $20 billion
in the next fiscal year. welfare re-
form, elimination of hunger, re-
duction of environmental pollution,
elimination of discrimination and
Congressional reform

Although there are more than
forty candidates who support its
goals, CAF will be selecting those
candidates involved in the close
races, where their opponents differ
significantly on the issues, and
where contributions can change the
outcome of the election. Funds
raised through this nationwide ef-
fort are disbursed through CAF’s
two-step proc The Board nomi-
nates the candidates, and then the
nominees are submitted to the con
tributors who, by their votes, will
choose the candidates to receive
funding

At Bucknell, various fund-rais-
ing activities take place dur-
ing the next three weeks. All con-
tributions will go to the candidates,
as no percentage is taken out for
CAF expenses. For information

HE JAUNDICED EYE

Half of the Problem

By KENNETH DOWST

Geoff Blood, cigarette in hand, surveyed the assembled multitude,
and sadly noted its two most salient characteristics: (1) It was rather
a small multitude, even by Union County standards ‘(perhaps 35 souls);
(2) It was a slightly freaky multitude. Jack Blyskal, small and slightly
freaky himself, looked disappointed, too. That which the ‘Campus Calen-
dar” had listed simply as “Drug Program” was attended by too few
people; and even fewer ‘‘straight” people. Inadequate publicity had again
taken its toll.

There exist today in God’s green Commonwealth two drug prob-
lems; and the aformentioned sad-looking persons, some other persons,
and your friendly neighborhood university have been working on the
elimination of one.

One Problem

This group wants to help (not lecture to, rat on, or conyert) those
students who are having difficulties of various sorts with monprescribed
drugs: psychological or physical dependence, a bad trip, mild paranoia,
neglect of other aspects of life, whatever. They want also to dissemi-
nate some relevant information. Tuesday’s “Drug Program’”’ dissemi-
nated some information through the vehicles of a rather excellent film-
strip on marijuana and a discussion.

Additional programs are planned, dealing with other classes of drugs
and other aspects of drug use. Working with drug users and potential
drug users in this manner ought certainly to cause a decline in bad
drug-related experiences, and, ought to assuage the intellectual-medical-
psychological drug problem.

The other drug problem in these United States is considerably more
dangerous, in terms of its effects on users’ lives. Naturally enough, no
one is doing much about it.

The Yahoos

While doctors, psychologists, liberal students, and four or five clergy-
men tend to concern themselves with the medical-psychological aspect
of drug uses, that creature which the great taxonomist H.L. Mencken
classified as Boobus americanus creates (in his own image) yet another
problem for the drug user: criminality, apostasy, “immorality,” and
frequently incarceration. This problem is more difficult to treat, because
the remedy must be applied not to drug users, but to 175 million law-
abiding, right-thinking, conservatively-dressing, patriotic, conformist, in-
tolerant Yahoos; to whom the Founding Fathers, apparently in a moment
of drunken stupor, granted the rights to bear arms, reproduce, and,
worst of all, write laws.

The Yahoos have established laws to suppress things and actions
they find offensive: pornography, drunkenness, homosexual relations, in-
tegration, nudity, miscegnation, certain drugs, and other earthly de-
lights; but the laws against all but two of these items, if not exactly
humane, fall short of total ruthlessness. For example, though they prose-
cute those who write, publish, distribute, or sell pornography, the Ya-
hoos more often than not observe the Supreme Court’s ruling that mere
possession is not grounds for arrest. They usually allow profane words
to be printed, provided that the words have no sexual connection.
Drunkenness is tolerated ‘at New Year’s Eve celebrations, Irish wedd-
ings, and everywhere in private. Only with regard to homosexuality
and the use of certain drugs do America’s burghers come across worse
than Ivan the Terrible.

Take marijuana (figuratively speaking), for instance: The Fraternal
Order of Police, Odd Fellows, Wesley Fellowship, Benevolent and Pro-
tective Order of Elks, PTA, and Jaycees have seen to it that one is a
criminal if one sells it , buys it, possesses it, transports it, grows it, is
in the company of anyone who possesses it, or fails properly to weed his
garden. Like, wow.

If a seed, blown by the wind, lands in your back yard and takes root,
blaming God will not even reduce your sentence (and you might get
busted for blasphemy).

Not all drugs on the Yahoo taboo list are dangerous, and not all
dangerous drugs are on the list. One is seldom busted for possession of
most amphetamines and barbituates, because they are widely used by
such Great Silent Majority heroes as truck drivers, nurses, and prosti-
tutes. Alcohol is even more widely used; and caffein and tobacco, even
more so.

Marijuana, mescaline, LSD, and STP (to name a few) are forbidden.
though some of these have slighter medical and psychological effects
than legal drugs.

What criteria, then, determine whether the user of a certain drug
will be embraced by the Yahoos, or jailed by them?

Secular vs. Religious

One hypothesis is that it depends on whether or not the drug expands
the mind. Alcohol and barbituates dull the senses; caffein and ampheta-
Wines stimulate the senses; nicotine is merely carcinogenic. None are
hallucinogens or psychedelics. They may speed up or slow down (or
kill) one’s mind and bod, but they do not create another dimension. When
Yahoos want an estatic experience, they find it (if at all) in some of
their religions. A secular estatic experience must be suppressed, lest it
interfere with the religious.

A more likely distinction is as follows: Lawful drugs are those which
most of the Yahoos like, and unlawful drugs are those which most Yahoos
haven't tried yet. “‘. . . it is the distinguishing mark of democratic so-
cieties,” writes Mencken, “‘that they exalt the powers of the majority
infinitely, and tend to deny the minority any rights whatever.”

A user of drugs, whether alcohol, grass, or acid, may or may not have
medical or psychological problems; if so. a doctor counsellor should be
available. His problems can be made only worse by constant guilt. fear
of arrest, arrest, and Yahoo hypocrisy (viz.: feigning concern for his
health because “‘we don’t know what the long-term affects are,” while
allowing others to drink, smoke, and pollute themselves to death). Any
serious efforts to eliminate ‘‘the drug problem’ must treat both the drug
user and all those who irrationally despise him.

Meanwhile, Blood, Blyskal, et. al. are tackling one half of the prob-
lem; which is a helluva lot better than doing nothing at all.

By LINDA DIETRICK

“Miles changed the world. More
than once . Whoever comes
after him. whenever, wherever.
they have to take him into con-
sideration. They have to pass him
to get in front.

“This music is. This music is
new ... and it hits me like an

ary music Miles defines the
terms. That’s all. It’s his turf.”

That is how jazz authority Ralph
J. Gleason puts it, writing about
Mile’s Davis’ new album, ‘Bitches

The album. which marks Mile’s
recent shift toward rock, sold 200,-
000 copies in its first four weeks.

With that kind of record, it is
perhaps appropriate that Davis and
his quintet should headline the con-
cert for a weekend with the theme
“Human Potential.”

Inexperience

Seek Second MAC Title

By BOB WENDEL

Another soccer season is at hand,
and Craig Reynolds will be making
an effort to duplicate his 1969 sea-
son, by winning his second straight
MAC championship.

For those of you who saw last
years team in action, it can only
be said that coach Reynolds has
his work cut out for him. Last
years team was composed of nine

Soccer Coach Craig Reynolds is
putting together a team to defend
last year’s championship.

seniors, one junior, and one sopho-
more. Thus, to say that this is a
building year is an understatement.
However, Coach Reynolds has
considerable talent to work with.
This year, the NCAA ruled that
freshmen may play varsity ball
and this has provided Reynolds
with more quality ball players to
choose from
“In the past, in order to have
enough players to have interspuad
scrimmages, it was necessary to
retain some ball players who would
just never get to play an appreci-
able amount of soccer.
‘This year, however, with
aquisition of freshman e
1e possible to cut

the
dility,
the squad
who I think, have

d Booters

a good chance of someday playing
varsity ball.”

What will the consequences be of
freshman eligibility be? Reynolds
feels that it will strengthen his
team considerably. “For one thing,
there is only one practice. In the
past, the freshmen have been sep-
arated from the varsity, but this is
no longer true. I expect this to
make the squad more cohesive, as
well as making the transition from
freshman to varsity smoother.”

Although the soccer mentor
doesn’t foresee many freshmen ac-
tually playing for the varsity,
many will be playing on the ‘B’
team. This is a newly instituted
‘jv’ team, which will be playing its
own schedule.

Reynolds is very gung-ho about
the existence of the B team, since
it will give those varsity players
who would have been sitting on the
bench last year, a chance to gain
valuable game experience.

The fact that this years squad is
young and inexperienced, has
caused some considerable prob-
lems. The major one being which
formation to use. Last years
championship team played using
a 4-3-3. However, Reynolds doesn’t
feel that this allignment would uti-
lize his best 11 men.

“I’m experimenting with an en-
tirely new 5-1-2-2 formation. I real-
ly want to make use of a five man
line, but the team is inexperienced
defensively. Except for Greenwood,
who is a doubtful starter due to a
back injury, all of my potential
starters have had little varsity
background,” explained Reynolds.

Concerning the teams record,

Reynolds is optimistic. Although
the teams in the MAC are all older
and more experienced, the Bison
booters start off the year with four
non-conference contests, and “al-
though it would be nice to win at
least two of them, the games
should give us the opportunity to
‘gel’ as a team, and I feel that we
have the personnel to win another
MAC championship.”

By ALAN GROCHAL

With high hopes for a successful
year, Senior quarterback Greg Do-
viak is returning for his second
season as the starting varsity sig-
nal-caller.

Greg started as a quarterback at
(Mount Carmel High School in
Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania, in
his sophomore year.

He was switched to flanker his
junior year, but returned to signal-
caller his senior year.

“Making the adjustment to Col-
lege football wasn’t too difficult
for me because we used a similar
offense in high school.” he said.

Doviak’s freshman team finished
with only a 1-4 record, but showed
much talent, as 11 players won
starting positions on the varsity
as sophomores.

Greg was shifted to defensive
halfback his sophomore year as
well as backing up Ace passer Sam
Havrilak.

“I was put in at quarterback in
one game when Sam got hurt and
I didn’t even know the plays. The
Coach had to keep yelling them to
me from the sidelines.”

As a junior, Doviak started the
first three games, but was injured
in the Lafayette game with the
Thundering Herd trailing 20-0.
Backup passer Don Giacomelli
came in and led the Bisons to a
come-from-behind 21-20 victory.

Greg and Don alternated quar-
terbacking duties the rest of the
year.

Doviak’s junior statistics includ-
ed a 50 percent completion per-
centage on 191 tosses for 803 yards.

This year he beat out Co-Captain
Don Giacomelli and Howard Burke,
a transfer from Holy Cross, to re-
gain his starting position.

“The competition with Don and
Howie definitely made me play
better,” Greg said.

According to Doviak, the fact
that the Bisons are playing inde-
pendents instead of in a confer-
ence, should pose no problems to
the team’s desire.

“Previously, we’ve gotten up for
non-conference games as well as
conference games and so we
shouldn’t have any troubles this
year

Greg called his 5 foot 11 inch 180
pound frame a small disadvantage,

especially troublesome against big- ®

ger teams. He _ noted, however,
that the offensice line has been do-
ing very well at opening up path-
ways of vision,

“We'll do more passing
year.”” Greg predicted. “Last year
our passing was very ineffective
and most of my completions were
only for short yardage.”

Doviak, who considers himself a
better passer than runner, expres-
sed confidence in his receivers

“Jim Cassidy, Paul Gilewicz, and
Jay Griffin are all fine pass cat-
chers. With the running backs
coming out of the backfield, 1
should have 4 or 5 fine receivers
on each pass play.”

“We have an extremely tough
schedule with Baldwin-Wallace,
Rutgers, The Citadel, and David-
son, but their leagues are only a
little stronger than the teams in
our conference last year.”

Greg called the team vastly im-
proved over last season. He thinks
that the offensive line “is 100 per-
cent better.”

All in all, Doviak expects ‘‘a very
fine season.”

this

of the Bisons will get a big boost.

A new dining hall arrangement
calling for the integration of fresh-
men and upperclassmen was sub-
mitted to the Dining Hall Advisory
Committee last Tuesday.

Authored by committee member
Pete Holmes, the plan responds to
the “need of acquainting upper-
class and freshmen students.”

A December (1969) survey indi-
cated that while 57% of the men
favored the present plan, 43% of
the women disagreed with seg-
regating the freshmen.

Taking this into account and the
fact that upperclassmen down the

ABS Approves Student Judicial System

A review on judicial procedures

is now pending approval by Presi-

Students Formulate
Lectureship Series

By LINDA ANNE CAPUTO

In an attempt to provoke intel-
lectual stimulation outside of sched-
uled classes, a formal lecture series
is being proposed by a group of
interested students, headed by Bill
Greaves and Len Clayton.

Although specific speakers have
not been contacted as yet, these
students hope to bring such opinion-
makers as F. Lee Bailey, the de-
fense attorney for Sam Sheppard,
and Gloria Steinam and Dorothy
Pitman, feminists involved in Wo-
men’s Liberation, to the campus.

This series is being prepared for
the 71-72 academic year, but plans
are underway for one or two lec-
tures which will be offered next se-

‘“mester on a trial basis. It is the

intention of the organizers that no
charge will be made for these guest
lectures.

According to the student organ-
izers of this project, Greaves and
Clayton, ‘“‘such a program would
bring well-known speakers, rep-
resenting contrasting fields of con-
temporary thought to Bucknell.”

(Continued on Page 3)

tions and enforcement of university
disciplinary censures. Disciplin-
ary action will be taken on viola-
tions against the academic com-
munity such as interference with
the academic freedom and in-
fringement on the rights of others.

The committee also has jurisdic-
tion on cases involving damage to
University property, academic dis-
honesty, illegal use of firearms and
alcoholic beverages, and violation
of state and federal laws.

While the authoritative power
rests with the committee, the in-
terpretation of student violations
is up to the offices of the Deans of
Men and Women.

When a student is charged with
a violation by anyone in the Uni-
versity community, the dean con-
ducts a preliminary investigation,
and informs and advises the stu-
dent violator.

A preliminary investigation com-
mittee which consists of two stu-
dents from the Student Conduct
Committee and both deans will
decide whether official action or
counseling is necessary.

If the official action is necessary
the student has his choice of having
his case heard by the Committee
or having it taken care of adminis-
tratively by his personal dean.

In the course of discussion, an
amendment to decrease the num-
ber of faculty members failed for
lack of a second.

Before the recommendation to
send the review to President Watts
was passed by a 12-1 vote an ex-
planation was given that there are
two levels of review on student
cases, the Dean of Student Affairs,
and as final recourse, the Presi-
dent.

Also on the Wednesday agenda,
the ABS passed a resolution urg-
ing changes in the present dining
arrangement. This will be sent to
the administration and service
personnel for investigation.

The resolution urged that fresh-

men living on the freshman quad-
rangle should take breakfast at
Swartz Hall, upperclassmen should
have a breakfast-dinner meal tick-
et option, and that integration of
freshmen and upperclass students,
should be attempted.

The ABS also passed a resolu-
tion urging the offices of Univer-
sity Residence Halls and Fresh-
men Residence Program to delay
creation of an Inter-Dorm council,
consisting of all hall vice-presi-
dents.

The ABS resolution stated the
council objectives and those of re-
lated organizations such as AWS
and MCC should be reviewed to
avoid possible duplication of func-
tion.”

In order to review the situation
to the fullest extent, ABS would be
willing to establish a special com-

hill feel dining at Larison-Harris
Cafeteria more logical than at
University Cafeteria; the following
proposal was submitted.

University Cafeteria would be
come the freshman dining hall,
serving approximately 540 students.
The remainder of the Class of ’74
and all upperclass students down
the hill would eat at Larison-Har-
ris, with about 50 upperclass stu-
dents dining at Swartz on a Volun-
tary basis, thus assigning some
800 students to Larison-Harris.

Of these, the upperclassmen
would remain at Larison-Harris on
a permanent basis while the fresh-
men rotate between U.C. and Lari-
son-Harris,

The approximately 365 upper-
classmen at Swartz Cafeteria
would remain there with the pos-
sibility of freshmen eating break-
fast at Swartz.

This plan would keep almost the
same number of students at each
cafeteria as is presently there.

“I think its really necessary be-
cause the way its set up now, I’ll

Series of Programs
Probes Drug Usage

By SUSAN PRESTON

Dr. Thomas J. Risch, dean of
men, and a group of interested
students have initiated a drug in-
formation program on campus.
The aim of the program is to
explore the effects of drug usage
in a culture such as is found at
this university and to encourage
students to sponsor panels, discus-
sions, and lectures regarding
drugs and their usage.

This program is a result of the
University’s new policy regarding
drug usage. This policy aims at
discouraging use of illegal drugs
and eliminating their misuse by

students through drug pro-
grams and counseling. According
to Dr. Risch the series of pro-
grams already planned is only the
beginning of a “multi-faceted drug

education program” that will
eventually give rise to a permanent
drug information center.

At the present time five nights
have been scheduled for drug dis-
cussions. The first two nights con-
sisted of film strips on marijuana,
stimulants, and sedatives followed
by student-led discussions. On
September 22 a filmstrip concern-
ing psychadelic drugs will be
shown with discussion to follow.

The AWS Challenge Committee is
bringing three lawyers to campus
to discuss the legal aspects of
drugs on October 7. The September
30 program is as yet unplanned
and suggestions would be welcom-
ed by Dr. Risch.

According to Dr. Risch the film
strips try to present an objective,

create a learning experience for
those involved.

Dean Dunlop, chairman of stu-
dent dining plans for the Dining
Halls Advisory committee, called
the Tuesday meeting to review the
dining situation in its present per-
spective.

No decisions for altering the ar-
rangement were made at the meet-
ing; rather student and faculty
opinion was heard and the current
conditions were discussed.

Miss Mabel Plumacher, Director
of University Food Service, report
ed on the overcrowded dining con-
ditions which resulted primarily
from the larger freshman class
and the number of uppedclass stu-
dents buying meal tickets.

At this time, the three dining
halls are feeding more students
than they can comfartably accomo-
date, and any shifting of dining ar-
rangements would change the over-
taxation of facilities.

An Afro-American ™Mposium
will be held here November 15 and
16

The Sub-committee on Black
Studies, who is sponsoring the Sym-
posium, announced that the main
guest will be Dr. Charles Hamilton,
a well known author, from Co-
lumbia University

Events planned for the two days
include the main address given by
Dr. Hamilton and discussion groups.
Monday, November 16 Dr. Hamil-
ton will attend classes on appro-
priate subjects.

Dr. Hamilton while a professor at
Columbia University, in coopertion
Stokley Carmichael wrote the book,
Black Power: The Politics of Liber-
ation in America.

The Afro-American Symposium is
part of a proposal by the sub-com-
mittee of the faculty of the College

Movement for Peace Plans Campaigning and Community Action

By JAN WILLIAMS

During the past week a group of
students have formed an ad hoc
&committee to plan peace activities
for students here during the fall
elections. Calling itself the Student
Movement for Peace, it now has
formulated plans for working in
two different directions: political
campaigning and community action.
The political aspect, headed by
Jack Schmidt and Dave Logan, is
already in action. The group has
decided to concentrate its support
behind two candidates: Milton
Shapp, a Democrat running for
governor of Pennsylvania, and Ar-
thur Berger, a Democrat running

(ero scemymccimncayremtnenagcenetnajtecoameratan nmap eit

; .

for Congress from the 19th Con-
gressional District.

Shapp, being a gubernatorial can-
didate, would seemingly have little
place in the peace movement. How-
ever, the committee feels that as
the leading Democratic candidate
in the state, he will lend support
to other peace candidates. Shapp,
who has dovish tendencies, is cen-
tering his caampaign around en-
vironmental issues and a tax re-
evaluation.

Berger, who’s district is located
around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,
has been endorsed by the Move-
ment for a New Congress and Ref-
erendum ‘70 both non-partisain
peace groups. He is the only such

candidate running anywhere near
the Lewisburg area. The commit-
tee hopes to receive funds from the
Movement for a New Congress to
assist with Berger’s support.

Campaign activities are already
moving, as Shapp will be traveling
through this area in a train Mon-
day. Leaving Harrisburg on Mon-
day morning, Shapp will make
stops in Sunbury, Milton, and Wil-
liamsport. The Student Movement
for Peace here is in charge of or-
ganizing rallies for all three
points, to be held when Shapp ar-
rives.

The group emphasizes that they
need a lot of help with these ral-

Aer RL CRE RREGA IRERIRAMN SCREAM Arete wen

lies. All students who are interest-
ed in working for peace are urged
to help. If there is enough student
support, transportation will be sup-
plied to Sunbury and Milton. All
those who are interested should
call a member of the committee
immediately, as plans are already
under way.

The non-political, or community
aspect of the group has no definite
plans as yet. Geoff Blood, who is
in charge of this area, says that
the main purpose of this aspect
of the Movement is to improve the
relationship and communication be-
tween Lewisburg and the univers-
ity. Although this has been at-
tempted before, the group feels

that it is vital to keep working
in this area.

Members of the committee and
their phone numbers are Jock
Schmidt, 3372, Joe Steinmetz, 1545,
Larry Donn, 1526, Suzie Grant.

1388, Bob Nachshin, 1771, David

Is There Any Doubt?

The continued existence of curfews
for freshmen women is unjustified.

To restrict the hours of freshmen
women and not those of freshmen men
is to imply that the women are somehow
less capable of self-discipline. To allow
curfews to continue is to take the res-
ponsibility for personal decisions out of
the hands of the individual.

Obviously, the simplest and quick-
est way to eliminate freshmen curfews
would be to ignore them. If “en masse”,
the freshmen women were to disregard
the curfew regulations, the rules would
effectively cease to exist. Simply and
quietly, responsibility for the student’s
personal life would be returned to the

student.

At It Again
To the Editor:

Well, we dirty hippie commie
fagot snobs were at it again last
(Monday) night — presenting B.U.
with its first major confrontation
of the new year. For those who saw
and enjoyed the show, be forewarn-
ed that you’re now all the proud
owners of 2I files in Washington
for subversive, disorderly booing
and hissing.

It all began when outside agita-
tors moved some tables together,
obviously grouping for a united-
front-for-action against existing
moral and social traditions. From
this central base, terrorists in-

trated the stirring, surrounding
crowd and managed to completely
baffle authorities by actually turn-
ing up the juke box so it could be
heard more than 10 feet away (an
unmanageable task for amateurs,
implying a professional job). Stun-
ned, cashiers and short-order cooks
stood in silence, awaiting the in-
evitable events to follow.

Suddenly, from out of the masses
two youths jumped to the center of
the floor (hitherto untouched by
any but shuffling feet) and — to
the utter amazement of all — ac-
tually began dancing! One could

> the result: the red alert
went up, summoning law enforce-
ment officials from surrounding
communities; all small-talk ceased
as eyes focused on the liberated
floor planks; people snickered, un-
til they caught the eyes of the
dancers (whose number increased
to six!) — after which there were
obvious withdrawal symptoms on
on the part of the onlookers (eye-
to-eye confrontation is terribly dif-
ficult to cope with); and more and
more propagandized filth belched
from the juke box (including fa-
miliar, scorned garbage goodies).

(We pause in our report to an-

Editor’s note: This is the first
in a series of articles by a
fermer federal prisoner. The
following is Part I of a two-
part essay. Part II will be run
in nevt week’s BUCKNELLIAN.

By A REVOLUTIONARY

In one sense, everyone in
jail is a political prisioner sim-
ply because they have interfer-
ed with the national purpose (i.
e., the production and accum-
ulation of wealth). That is to
say, their crimes against per-
sons and things have created
obstacles to the normal flow of
business, thereby affecting —
it is presumed damagingly —
the normal flow of business.
From this viewpoint they are
enemies of the state which ex-
ists primarily not for the social
good of citizens, but for the eco-
nomic, and indirectly, the mili-
tary communities.

The second category of polili-
cal prisoners has to do with
those inmates who through as-
sociation and/or study have

nounce that the dancers were defi-
nitely too involved with having a
good time to notice the ensuing con-
frontation).

Then, backed by the notorious
Bears (you guys were beautiful!),
the officials moved in to disperse
the crowd. But the tables were
turned, because the Bears knew us,
and since they weren’t out to has-
sle us anyway, they simply re-
quested relative calm (fear not,
all ye booers and hissers, your ac-
tions were not unnoticed — though
your k of dancing was). A
special thanks to the Bears (and
the Glorious Greek Baby Bear) for
extreme “cool” throughout the
heat of the battle.

At any rate, all went back to
normal and a satisfied, happy crew
of revolutionaries drifted onward.
One final note, however:

Those who began the dancing are
not students — they’re new friends,
unfamiliar with the fact that we
can dance to music anywhere on
campus except the hallowed
grounds of the Bison (custom?
tradition? status-quo?), score one
for all who follow natural instincts,
and welcome the non-indoctrinated
minority.

Today the Bison, tomorrow the
Bulkhead !!

Christmas Boycott
To the Editor:

We see as hypocrisy the extrava-
gant celebration of Christmas when
there is no peace on earth. So our
group feels it. is time for a Christ-
mas boycott. We are not going to
buy presents this year, nor are we
going to receive them. We will do
without decorations, and may be
fasting on Christmas day instead of
feasting.

Editor

Instead of spending, we will work
for peace on earth by giving our
money to help make amends for
the suffering we have caused —
such as by financially adopting a
Vietnamese child, and by giving
our time to stop war. We are call-
ing for people to put peace back in
Christmas — what better way to
observe the birth of Christ than to
bring an end to the war this year?

We are counting on college
groups to do most of the local work.
Here are some possible approaches
for organizing the boycott:

1. Contact local clergy — many
should be receptive to taking com-

THE SIDESHOW

‘To Work’

By

DAVID WEINBERGER

“Well, sure we lost the election, but we'll be back next year, you
can bet your pure gum booties!” The fighting spirit of the canvassers
of the Seventies is on the rise, and their battle cry is “Just Wait Till

Next Year!”

It is at least a bit unfair to criticize those with hope for not achiev-
ing immediate effects. After all, worthwile revolutions are not accomplish-
ed in a day. But this is also not a reason for not being upset by failures.
How can liberal canvassers show incredible zest for all aspects of the
campaign except for the outcome? Failure today does not guarantee

‘success tommorrow.

Part of the ethic by which America lives is that you must invest to
make money, you must suffer to produce greatness, you must work to
get your reward. But this ethic may be bankrupt. The canvassers seem
to be living by it. Today’s setbacks are merely the price for tomorrow’s
victories. In fact, today’s step backwards will probably be followed by an-

other step backwards tomorrow.

A liberal, a moderate, is someone who insists that he can cross the
ocean by wading. He does this because he thinks that only if he admits
the possibility that the water is over his head can he be in danger. They
want to change some things, but they still want a toe-hold on something

icozy and conservative.

A good scientist is better than a good liberal. A good scientist has
immoderate expectations that lead him to immoderate discoveries. A
good scientist breaks from tradition, looks again, and accomplishes the
foolhardy. A great scientist, an extremist, explains to his test tubes why
science can lead to little worthwhile, packs up his bags and goes for a

walk somewhere.

Test tubes are transparent recepticles that fill up with whatever is
poured into them, and then assimilates these new pourings so well that
the pourings assume the exact shape of the test tubes.

Extreme liberal revolutionaries are out chanting in the streets, burning
things, trashing things, all the time trying to capture the common
medium that unites conservative liberals like Nixon, moderate liberals
like Fulbright, and extreme liberals like Rudd: Power.

Maybe something concrete would help: It is hard to say things in typed

been radicalized into political
critics.

This type of inmate does not
usually have at his disposal suf-
ficient advice from others to
make his convictions viable
upon release.

The third category involves
those who have broken a law
to oppose state policy—usually
military—for moral and/or po-
litical reasons. Even here, how-
ever, the term tends to have a
loose application since some
people of this category were
not motivated by bona fied po-
litical reasons e.g., a draft re-
sister who opposes induction be-
cause he dislikes military reg-
imentation.

Protects the Capitalist

The federal penal system
must be analyzed within the
framework of what is loosly
called the Establishment, or the
governmental side of it. The
Federal Bureau of Prisons is
an agency —like the Federal
Bureal of Investigation — of the
United States Justice Depart-

PAGE TWO

THE BUCKNELLIAN

SEPTEMBER 18, 1970

ment which is headed by the
United States Attorney General,
a member of the President’s
Cabinet.

To the Justice Department is
entrusted custodianship of the
law, which primarily protects
commercial interests, and the
rights of citizens under the
overall scope of national well
being, ie., national prosperity.
The law is fashioned, and even
more importantly, is adminis-
tered by WASP echelons of
power, and as such cannot be
imagined as equally for blacks,
Puerto Ricans, Chicanos or
rebels.

In the Capalist West, and to
a sobering degree in the United
States, power is synonymous
with wealth Officialdom at any
level cannot help but react to
the challenge of its fundamen-
tal assumptions. And this it
does by exorbitantly punishing
the poor prisioner for not being
passively poor, and exorbitant-
ly punishing the political rebel
for not being peaceably, or
legally, rebellious. (Read
peacebly and legally as inef-
fectually).

Again, it is no mystery why
the United States Government
is among the most conservative
in the world and becoming
more so.

It is an administrative and
diplmatie agency protecting the
exploitative interests of a cap-
italistic empire—conglomerates,
banks, and insurance compan-
ies. Now, what is most de-
manded of a bureaucracy is
that it be logically consistent
with its purposes. Therefore,
the administration of any fed-
eral agency cannot run counter
to policies of the parent bureau-
cracy. The federal penal sy-
stem intends to refashion crim-
inals into good capalists, or
failing in this (as it usually
does) to discourage them from
future incursions against the
status quo by what Menninger
calls the “Crime of Punish-
ment.” It usually fails in this
also, but not for want of trying.

(To reduce the present 60% -
70% recidivism now flowing
from federal penal institutions,
budgeting and/or the quality of
personnel would have to im-
prove markedly. But such a

step would run at odds against
the “thing” (property) domin-
ated mentality of the public,
which underlies the severe pre-
judice against criminals who
are feared more than the poor,
more than the blacks.)

To conclude, therefore, fed-
eral policy toward prisoners
has implicit discrimination
written into it — men in prison
are criminals, unfit to live with
“normal” people. This discrim-
ination becomes more pro-
nounced against those who
voice opposition to national
policy and purpose. And it be-
comes particularly pronounced
against those who have pub-
licly acted (illegally) in oppo-
sition to native immoralities
like racism and_ especially
warmaking.

Prison Bureaucracy

Penal personnel come from
limited (and conservative) edu-
cational backgrounds; a high
school education is no longer
required. Very often, they come
from rural backgrounds and
military service. Not infre-
quently guards first embarked

Lectures
(Continued from Page 1

This series would provide an in
formative program comparable to
those being conducted on many
leading university campuses.

“Secondly a formal lecture
series, open to the entire com
munity, would integrate the various
departments of the university

“Frequently, individual and de-
partmental lectures are largely ig-
nored by students whose interests
are not in such restricted fields
Also, it would tend to alleviate the
feeling of isolation which exists on
this campus.”

Besides conducting a formal lec-
ture in the evening, any guest
speaker would be contracted for a
half-day appearance. Ideally, he
would be present at a luncheon
with the faculty and at an informal
afternoon discussion with interested
students.

After the evening lecture. he
would be available for a question
and answer period

Clayton and Greaves hope that
this lecture series will be supported
by any available funds that the
university can allocate, supplement-
ed by co! utions from interested
organization -ampus: honorary
departmental, and social

Approximately 95 of the stu
dents who responded to the ques-
tionaire, did so favorably. Consider.
ing the need and demand for this
program, it is hoped that it will

many moments where the man can
only arouse feelings of disgust and
hatred in observers, owing to his
incessant ruthlessness and seem-

him

Patton does not overlook even the
most ute incident involved in

lies in the fact that it stresses only
the man, without glamorizing him,

B: Do you think students could

F: I think they could—it could
be spontaneous. But I think a riot
would be caused by reaction to

F: We all carry a blackjack—for

have tear gas pens. No one carries

B: Is the University a problem to
patrol?

F: I feel we've got the coopera-

factor. In that sense, it’s not a big
problem.

B: As Chief of Campus Security,

lines. The best one (I) can do is try to provide places in sentences where
people can jump off to get into the real meaning. Writing a column makes
‘one a liberal because it is an attempt to achieve the near impossible
through moderate means. A liberal uses a typewriter to write to people.
A liberal who regrets his moderation enough to acknowledge the regret
but not enough to cut himself loose from it, writes to his typewriter and

lets other people read it.

All of which is to say that there is no point in being coherent when
what one has to say is not coherent. The world is not coherent. It is not
that the world is now insane and must be brought back to sanity, but
rather that the world is now, always was and always will be insane. In an

insane world, sanity is madness.

Now for a second concrete statement: Agnew is now saying that it is
a faction of the Congress that is inciting the minority of trouble makers.
The government itself, he is saying, is the betrayer of America. Just what
America is becomes totally lost in a haze when we can’t even identify a
government by its institutions. Agnew is saying “We are America” and is
excluding legitimate American Government from America. And Strom
Thurmond told a recent conservative youth congress that guerilla war-
fare has started in America. In one year we will accept that, and then its

acceptance will establish its reality and cause its growth.

So we should all go out and canvass for a system ( for one cannot
politically canvas for a person; at best one can canvass for a ‘‘worth-
while” representative to be included within the American system: it is
impossible to both work for people and work for politics). That the system
itself is denying is legitimate? Work for it? Work for him? No, the answer
may be to stop working. Or, to be more coherent, to stop putting an object n
after the verb “to work.” Work, but do work that is play and play that times marked brutality emerges |
is work. Then maybe we can begin to stop splitting ourselves up as in-
dividuals, as groups, as races, as species, as objects in a world of abjects

both animate and inanimate.

to the less wholesome attitude to-
ward political prisoners is the self-
perpetuating nature of the penal
bureaucracy. (The nation is well
familiar with the resistance of

they rely for support.) Something
directly parallel exists with penal
institutions. If the evonomic life of
a community would be threatened

or by budgetry dificiencies, then
active resistance by large and pet-

There are high incidences of medi-

of this clashes with the rather re-

It is terrible to contemplate in

“The team is fairly big for a col-

the coach. ‘The interior line av-
erages about 205 Ibs. but it is not
basically a heavy team. It is a tall
team, with a lot of boys on the line
about six foot one. There are plenty
of tall, rangy boys and lots of tal-

ant on this squad.”

feels that ‘“‘the passing of-

have good prospects at quarter-

We'll probably have a limited run-

ball a great deal.

The defense should improve as
the season progresses. Until now,

Thus far, the team has escaped

of the frosh program is to prepare
players for the varsity. Unlike
many other sports, freshmen can-
not participate in varsity competi-
tion.

They help the varsity by practic-
ing with them every day and by
providing competition for them in
scrimmages. This will be true this
season even more than last year.

The team still plays a 7-game
schedule of their own, which is a
very extensive schedule for a frosh
team. Said Coach Lane, ‘The whole
purpose of any freshman program
is to produce players for the vars-
ity. The school’s schedule for the
freshmen is much larger than other
universities.’ We hope to send 30
players up to the varsity next year.

It would be unfair at this time to
begin making comparisons to last
year’s team, which compiled a fine
5-1 record, but the coach would say
that “this year’s squad is compar-
able to last year’s in enthusiasm
and spirit. This is a larger squad
by ten men and both teams are a
real pleasure to coach. It should be
a lot of fun coaching these boys.”

“School spirit is still alive no
matter what anyone says, especial-
ly when it comes to football. There
is a lot of enthusiasm and emotion
connected with it because football
is a very emotional game,” con-
cluded the coach.

Phi Lambda Theta Builds House;
Construction Begins January, ’71

By NICKI DREW

The alumni of Phi Lambda Theta
have announced plans for the build-
ing of a new house on Fraternity
Row between Sigma Phi Epsilon
and the University Observatory.

Construction work, which is
scheduled to begin in 1971, will go
on for approximately six to eight
months. It is hoped that the new
house will be ready for habitation
by next September.

Funds for the building were ob-
tained by the 514 members of Phi
Lam’s alumni chapter after an
extensive period of money-raising.
F Priority will be the actual
living area, which will be designed
around the needs of an entirely
new active chapter. Because it is
probably the next-to-last frater-
nity to build a new house, Phi
Lam will have the opportunity to
benefit from the living problems
faced by other fraternities.

The question of women members
is another which the alumni are
considering with respect to th
building of the new ho Although
Phi Lambda Theta has been open
to women for the last few years, it
will pledge only men this fall. How-
ever, the alumni are open to the
question of inducting women in the
future, and are interested in de-
signing the physical facilities of
the house around the possibility of

Survey Seeks Ideas
On Black Proposals

By STEPHEN WYATT

The Black Studies Subcommittee
of the Curriculum Committee,
chaired by Dr. Harvey Powers, is
issuing a questionnaire to univer-
sity students and faculty concern-
ing their opinions on the unfolding
Afro-American Studies Program

Devised by the committee as a
means of discovering the various
attitudes toward black studies with-
in the campus community, it will
determine the amount of knowledge
already present and collect sug-
gestions for future improvement in
the curriculum.

The questionnaire is to be divid-
ed into two parts, one primarily
concerned with the faculty and
the other with student response.
The faculty questionnaire, which
will be returned to the committee,
is basically an inquiry into the
number and types of courses pre-
sently offered and where possible
other openings may be found.

The student questionnaire will be
circulated by the ABS and will
concern itself with the degree of
exposure to afro-american courses

To review, therefore, the nation-

enriches 6% of the world’s people
by controlling nearly 60% of the
world’s wealth. That is the dom-

there underlying culture, education,
religion, local and national political
life. Not only are profits politics,
profits are mores, ethnics, morality
and religion.

be forgotten ‘‘Moan of 69”. The

“Moan of 69’, you may remem-
ber, began in New York and spread
uncontrollably throughout the East-
ern Seaboard until it was delayed
by a traffic jam in Hackettstown.
But think of your country friends,
and our present dilemma with the
kids of today. Do you think we
want to hear your moans? Do you
think that at 10:00 next Thursday
we want the restless moan of to-
day’s youth to disturb the sleeping
minds of Tomorrow’s Republicans?
Surely there must be some other
way you grungy little rich kids
can express yourselves. How about
taking over the Student Union (be-
fore it takes over you)... .

Really, friends, is this the time
for moaning and groaning? I say
bring a little laughter into the
world- Be creative, don’t follow the
crowd and moan like all the other
Ivy League guys. Try to snicker
when people ask you about the
Student Union or the University
Housing Staff. . .pretend you have
great sympathy for ignorance. . .

And about this dope situation.
Well no need to moan it from the
rooftops. Our buildings aren’t so
thick that we can’t smell those
moans rushing through the pipes.
Just keep it out of the public
rooms, and in the high schools.
At least there are no worms in my
house for all you Fraternity men
to moan in.

The American Flag is still fly-
ing high, regardless of who’s tug-
ging at the cord. So the next time
you plan on borrowing an ALL
CAMPUS MOAN from _ another
school think about the little guy
who brings the New York Times
to your door, and what’s going to
happen when your selfish moan-
ing upsets his rickety red wagon.

“An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,” is one of Ambrose Bierce’s
short stories which will come to the Hilltop screen this Friday. Partly
because Bierce goes down as a saint in my book, but mostly because
this film version of his story captures some beautiful moments in life,
I recommend it highly to all. Written and directed by Robert Enrico, the
movie has won the Cannes Film Festival Grand Prix, Journees Inter-
nationales de Tours, Rencontre Internationale de Films pour la Jeunes-

se, and the Academy Award.

Quote of the Week - “It should be a good year for fraternities; this
freshman class is conservative.” - overheard at an Interfraternity Council

meeting on Tuesday, September 15, 1970.

Editorial Board meets on Friday at 6 p.m. in the Pit of New Dorm.

THE DAY OF THE DOLPHIN By Robert Merle Translated by
Helen Weaver 318 pages. Greenwich: Fawcett Crest Paperback. $.95

“Saigon, January 4, 1973 (UPI) The U.S. cruiser ‘Little Rock’
destroyed by atomic explosion off Haiphong. No survivors.”

Couched within a fascinating story of Man’s discovery of an-
other species of intelligent life (in the least expcted of all places -
here on Earth) is a fictional yet frightening account of the American
reaction to the above telegrammed event. Robert Merle has skill-
fully illustrated the inadequacies of Man’s evolutionary vestiges in
the age of atomic energy. His appraisal of American reactions under
pressure is particularly noteworthy since Merle is a Frenchman.

Day of the Dolphin concerns the efforts of a cetologist, Profes-
sor Sevilla, to establish verbal communication with the Tursiops
Truncatus — the Bottle-Nose Dolphin. Aided by the mammal’s ex-
treme friendliness and the similarity of the dolphin’s brain to that
of the human, Sevilla is able to train two dolphins to speak. The
dolphins are eager to converse with men whom they consider their
gods. The dolphins, who love Man and believe in his goodness, are
distressed upon their discovery that Man also dies.

Although Seville’s interest is purely scientific there are, in-

evitably, other U.S. agencies concerned with the military exploita-
tion of the dolphins. It is their eventual use in underwater warfare
which teaches the dolphins that men kill. The ensuing despair of the
dolphins borders on the existential. But before the dolphins realize
the plans of Man, they unknowingly plant the atomic bomb with
which we begin this review.

The American reaction to the crisis was, as Merle sees it,
typical: “A race of omnipotent gods attacked on their Olympus by
an inferior species could not have been more suprised, more hor-

rifed oo. .

or mor certain of annihilating their assailants in short

order.” The destruction was attributed to the Red Chinese. There

was, however

Merle’s counterpart of a southern demagogue stated, “‘I won’t sleep
peacefully until our rockets have turned Communist China into one
big parking lot.” And typically, few voices were raised in intel-
lectual search for a reasonable solution.

an aversion to thinking of the Chinese people as
human beings. The cry was for immediate reprisals aimed at ‘Vital
suggested the millions of people
about to die. The ‘‘Chinks’’ and ‘‘Yellowbellies’” were guilty of
three fundamental sins: They were yellow, they were little, and

became unassailably patriotic.

In summation, Merle has produced a perceptive piece of fiction
which can be analyzed on a number of different levels. Being both
light and quick, I especially recommend it for recreational yet

educational reading.

Former Inmate Speaks Out
Political Prisoners in Federal Prison

pose it by civil
(revolutionaries) .
The penal atmosphere into which
a political prisoner steps is coercive
to a high degree. No longer does
he possess rights of free speech
and association—talking responsible
politics or acting responhibly poli-
tically will outlaw him. Ordinarily
he cannot seek out or meet with
those sharing his views or open to
them. Authorities censor his mail
both ways and frequently limit it
to members of his family. Visits
from those militants with whom he
might have worked outside are
strictly forbidden. He cannot write
politically without censorship, an
unfreedom he invariably rejects. In
effect he is a citizen without rights,
a man temporarily without a coun-
try — he who has performed the
lofty service of unflinchingly and
expensively pointing out his coun-
try’s crimes aand mistakes. He has
dared to be his nation’s conscience
and its reward for that has been
ostracism, a moratorium on his

disobediences

liberty and very likely a stigma
which he will bear indefinitely.

Pragmatically, the power struc-
ture and the society cannot allow
any other fate for its serious cri-
tics. Morally it must, or history
will write its epitaph. Yet this na-
tion gives no evidence that it will
allow itself the salutary luxury of
serious political criticism. When it
becomes serious to the point of be-
coming threatening, it is simply
crushed — by police action, by the
bench, and in prisons.

Periodically, the federal penal
system boasts of the liberal char-
acter of its policy, of the steady
progress ‘‘rehabilitative’’ measures
— educational facilities, opportuni-
ties for skills and trades, outlets
for earning power in industry and
work-release programs, etc.

But in these key areas of human
rights without which men stagnate
and grow in desperation, the reality
is frozen and depressing. And in
application to political prisoners
the net effect of policy and practice
is to break the will of all except
the most hardy.

More to the concrete, the social

deviant in prison cannot read what
he prefers — “radical’’ journals
are not allowed; he cannot talk
freely with others or with those
of similar persuasions; he cannot
hold political meetings, even of a
speculative nature let alone of an
organiationzal type; he cannot see
visitors of suspect political belief,
nor can he write them legally; he
cannot write what he thinks or
publish his convictions. He is a
ward of Mother State and subject
to her power, vulnerable to her
whims.
CONCLUSION

To paraphrase the cultural, in-
stitutional and political reality to
which political prisoners must re-
late — —he has rebelled, or prom-
ises to rebel, against the most pow-
erful and cohesive bureaucracy in
history, which despite its surface
ideology of human rights, is radi-
cally conservative. He has, by his
intentions, words and actions, be-
come an enemy of the State and
not merely its political side since
the superstate today is economic
and military as well as political.

ee

Now, we have previously assum-
ed the role of institutionalied jus-
tice is ultimately to preserve and
enhance the economic life of em-
pire — it is to preserve property
and people insofar as they contri-
bute to commercial health.

The political prisoner has chal-
lenged the assumptions of capital-
ism through a very basic position.
“Justice’’, therefore can react to
him in two possible, if unlikely
ways: (1) it can recognie non-vio-
lent civil disobedience as a right
implicit in the Declaration of In-
dependence and in the Bill of
Rights; (2) it can punish political
prisoners while making concessions
to their unique qualities, making
penal provision for partial expres-
sion of right and conviction; it can
do what it now does — punish them
extravagantly for their beliefs and
service.

Practically, it can do nothing
else, The capitalist state has too
many inherent contradictions to be
uncontradictory relative to those
who point out, at great expense to
themselves, its contradictions.

of the City of Boston’ and ‘Director of the World Ques-

tion Center,” is an artist in residence at Jurson Institute
in New York City. This exciting man posesses an un-
inhibited imagination and fantastic energy, which have
helped him to create various experiences at the univers-
ities he has visited.

Byars’ projects require student participation which
he needs during his stay at Bucknell. His visits to the
University of Minnesota and several other schools pro-
voked great excitement among students, who then made
their committment to his projects. We of Colloquy Com-
mittee and James Lee Byars think this experience can
happen here.

The best way for Mr. Byars to communicate his ex-
citement to you is to meet you personally and to talk about
his project. If you’re interested, call Barb Gladding at
1778 or at the CA at 1217 this evening or tomorrow. Mr.
Byars is arriving Tuesday afternoon and will meet with
you sometime on Wednesday.

Help.

Help make Colloquy. The Colloquy Central Committee
needs your help. If you have time, and energy to give,
stop in the CA or call 1217.

It was at this point that the

passing was a bright spot as he completed 20 out of 36 attempts.

Jim Cassidy: Sophomore Asset

By JEFF QUINZER
One of a trio of excellent var-
football receivers, with sen-
aul Gilewiez and junior Jay
is sophomore flanker-de-

Jim, one of the few Bisons to
play both ways, recovered a fum-
ble on defense and made several
i catches offensively in
ay’s loss to Temple.
His defensive recovery helped
set up the Thundering Herd’s lone
score.

Cassidy doesn’t find playing of-
fe and defense overly taxing.

“The coach usually gives me
plenty of rest. I really like to play
both ways,” he said.

Jim didn’t begin his football
career ag either a flanker or a
defensive halfback. In fact he has
only played these positions one
year previously.

“In high school I was a tight
end and a defensive end, but I was
switched to a wide receiver as a
freshman due to a lack of size.””

He also played defensive half-
back for the first time his fresh-
™man season.

Cassidy doesn’t consider speed |

Jim represents an imposing target
for quarterback Greg Doviak. He
thinks that his size, especially his
height, is more of an aid on de-
fense, however

Jim Cassidy

ANY ONE INTERESTED ;

Cassidy credits Assistant Coach
Larry Landini and senior Paul
Gilewicz with being the most help-
ful in teaching him the job of a
receiver.

The Bison offense uses receivers
much like running backs. Most
pass plays are designed to gain
five to ten yards.

“We don’t use deep patterns of-
ten, except in desperate  situa-
tions,” Jim added.

Cassidy expects to find more
zone defenses than man-to-man this
year. In each defense, he feels, the
receiver has a different objective.

“In a zone, my job is to find
open spaces, while in man-to-man
coverage I try to beat my man.”

Despite a successful game statis-
tically, Jim was not happy with
his performance Saturday.

“When you don’t win you can-
not be satisfied with your play,”
he said.

Frank Dimaggio did the majority

The question remains, what about
the rest of the season. A few things
seem rather obvious. Doviak’s pas-
sing was the only thing that kept us
in the ball game offensively, and
unless the University develops a
running attack, our successful pas-
sing days could be over.

And as concerns our passing,
anyone who saw the game will be
hardpressed to recall more than
five or six pass patterns which
were productive. Although this was
sufficient opening day, by the time
B.U. meets Baldwin-Wallace this
Saturday, their defense will know
those plays by heart.

It can only be said that unless
Doviak can mix his plays better,
and the line can provide the backs
with more running room, it could
be a long season.

James Hammerlee Reflects on Various Aspects of Colloquy ’70

By DAVID HAMMER
Feature Editor’s Note: Mr.
James Hammarlee, Director of the
Office of Student Programs, is this
Week’s interview guest. Despite an
ever-changing schedule, Mr. Ham-
merlee took time to offer some
candid opinions on subjects as di-
verse as Colloquy, last year’s strike
activities, his backgroung at Yale
Divinity School and his work at the

University.
BUCKNELLIAN: Based on past
experience, by what criteria would

you distinguish a successful Col
lequy from a failure.

HAMMERLEE: Colloquy, for
many people, has been judged
somewhat on involvement. But
that’s trickey, because it isn’t
that people just attend something
or show up. Rather, the idea be-
hind Colloquy is for persons to be
confronted with some new ideas
and to test them in the light of
some others, If that happens, it
could be judged successful.

B: What do you consider the
main theme of this year’s Fall

Colloquy?

H: The theme of Colloquy has
been expressed by the committee
in a number of ways, and it’s still
a little vague, I’m afraid. The
phrases ‘Human Potential,’ ‘The
Affirmation of the Positive,’ have
been in the minds of the committee
since the beginning. And, to a cer-
tain extent, many of the visitors
do represent a background of a
training which indicates the ways
they have seen human strengths,
potentials, realized.

students have set up a center to

not have a physical location on

Leshner Continues Research
Psychology Prof. Receives Foundation Grant

Dr. Alan Leshner, assistant pro-
fessor of psychology here, has been
awarded two research grants total-
ing more than $40,000 and will ad-
minister a third grant of $6,900
made to the University

A long-term grant of $35,343 was
awarded to Dr. Leshner by the
National Science Foundation for the
study of behavioral mechanism of
energy regulation. The grant will
be used for the purchase of equip-
ment and supplies and for provid-
ing undergraduate students with the
opportunity to work on the project.

Professor Leshner’s work con-
cerned with determining why or-
ganism exercises and why it cho-
oses its food the way that it does.
The theory on which this research
is based suggests that animals en-
gage in these two behaviors pri-
marily to control. the amount of fat
in their bodies.

Among the undergraduates who
will work with Professor Leshner
in this research are Donald H.
Cohen, a senior John Gardner, a

junior
senior.

The second grant to Dr. Leshner
is for $4,740 from the National In-
stitute of Mental Health and is for
a one-year study of the role of the
endoctrine system in behavioral
mechanisms for energy regulation.

The funds from the grant, which
are intended to determine the long-
term feasibility of the project, will
be used for the purchase of equip-
ment to set up a biochemistry lab
at the psychology laboratory and
for engaging undergraduate stu-
dents in the project. The same
three students will work with Pro-
fessor Leshner on this project.

Professor Leshner will also di-
rect the administration of a $6,900
grant from the National Science
Foundation to the department of
psychology. The grant is for the
purchase of equipment to aid teach-
ing and student research in the
fields of physiological psychology,
child psychology, animal behavior,
and human vision.

The following is a list of this weekend’s Colloquy events:
FRIDAY

3:00 p.m.

“The Value of a Clean World’—seminar with Euell Gibbons

and Murray Durst—Acadamic Quad (if rain Lambda Chi)
followed by Gibbons’ ‘Discovery’? color film (24 Min.)

The funds from the grant, which
are matched by the University,
will provide students with the op-
portunity to work with highly so-
phisticated equipment. Among the
special items already installed are
a three-field tachistoscope, two
neurophysiology lab stations, and
closed circuit television cameras
and recorders.

what it isn’t than what it is. It
was an attempt to get away from
a complete emphasis on the topical
and political issues and to get into
the more personal questions.

B: In that light, do you consider
this Colloquy less ‘political’ than
past ones, and is that a good di-
rection to take?

H: It’s hard to say that it’s a
‘good’ direction, if that is the di-
rection. In this time when the tre-
mendous issues are still very much
political—the issues that have been
with us for what seems like forever

i.e., the war, our internal politics
and all of these questions which
are still such overriding ones—it
would be easier to get people in
and re-hash some of the same
questions. The intention of this
Colloquy, though, was not to avoid
those questions, but to bring, in a
sense, a di ant perspective—to
get a person ready individually to
meet some f these problems.
Therefore, it is not so ‘unpolitical’
as one might think.

B: The argument has been for-

Organizations Award
Teaching Fellowships

By GINA SMITH

Two scholarship organizations,
the Woodrow Wilson National Fel-
lowship Foundation and the Insti-
tute of International Education,
have announced annual scholar-
ship competitions for graduate and
undergraduate students.

Established in 19
Wilson Fellowships attract outstand-
ing young people to careers in col-
lege teaching. This year the foun-
dation will award Fellowships to
250 American and 50 Canadian stu-
dents. In addition 700 finalists will
be designated and recommended to
graduate schools of their choice
for financial aid.

An anticipated 10,000 students
will be nominated for this honor by
their professors. Students in the
humanities and social sciences are
eligible, as are those in the natural
sciences and mathematics who
demonstrate a clear interest in col-
lege teaching.

Committees receive and read the
nominee’s application materials, in-

Woodrow

also administers grants offered by
various foreign governments, uni-
versities and private donors. Ap-
proximately 554 awards will be of-
fered for the acalemic year 1971-

award must be US citizen at the
time of application, have a bache-

This alteration of yearbook ar-

reasons. First, the L’Agenda staff
feels that a yearbook should have

inclusive coverage of the aca-
demic year. Secondly, there has
been a financial deficit accumulat-
ed over the past three years. The
late summer edition provides fi-
nancial savings over spring de-
livery, even after mailing costs to
seniors. “This allows the staff to
maintain the high standards of

A Radical Reordering

The community of this University The
must commit itself to increasing the di-
versity of its student population.

It seems rather obvious to point out
that it is in the best interests of an ac-
ademic community to have its students
come from various backgrounds. With
different experiences come different
ideas, and out of an exchange of those
ideas comes a better perspective of life.
The arguements go on, but the fact re-
mains that this community is far from
achieving any sort of diversity.

Let us take a brief look at the Class
of 1974. 81% of the students are from
the Middle Atlantic states while 9% are
from New England. Most of the students
are from suburban schools; there are
probably as many students here from
Westfield, New Jersey as there are from
New York City. Eight black freshmen
enrolled this year in a class of 800, and
one would have to look hard to find any
Chicanos, Puerto Ricans or other minor-
ity groups. Yet we glide blissfully on; all
fine at Camp Bucknell.

THE ABC OF RELATIVITY By Bertrand Russell 144 Pages. New
York: Mentor Books. Paper. $.75

Bertrand Russell believed that “everybody knows that Einstein did
something astonishing but very few know exactly what it was that he
did.” When ole Bertrand had thoughts like that he usually wrote a book
about them (he wrote more than forty). So way back in 1925 he penned
The ABC of Relativity.

Russell reasoned that the layman’s inability to comprehend the theory
rested in the fact that accounts of the time would “generally cease to be
intelligible just at the point where they begin to say something impor-
tant.” Accordingly his version suffers from the opposite flaws, mainly
due to excessive simplification.

How simple is it? Well, he gives a consise account of the develop-
ment of scientific thought leading to relativity beginning with the Egypt-
ians, throug Galileo and Newton, Michelson and Morely to Einstein. In
the meantime he covers and expounds the standard questions that are
raised by relativity, for example: space-time, the expanding universe,
the velocity of light, the abolition of force, etc.

So the question now arises as to whether or not you should trouble
yourself by reading ABC. Generally if you can’t answer the following
questions pick up a copy. If you’re capable then pass it up.

(1) Q. What is the 47th therom of Euclid and what is its origin?

A, The Pythagorean Theorem. According to Russel, it was de-
rived from an Egyptian rule of thumb: a field measured in
the proportions 3, 4, and 5 formed a right triangle.

Q. What is the shortest distance between two points?

A. A line? Wrong. Now it’s a geodesic (consider the great
circle route).

Q. Does a scale give you your weight?

A. Obviously not, strictly speaking it gives you your mass.
To find out your weight you’ll have to consult a spring bal-
ance.

Since the book was ritten nearly fifty years ago it has undergone a
number of revisions. If you look closely you'll be able to spot them.
Illustrations are adequate and supplement the rudimentary mathetical
theory, which can be overlooked to avoid confusion. Finally, it should
not be forgotten that the account has been written by Bertrand Russell.
As usual when reading his works, you feel as though you’re communicat-
ing directly with the man. When the topic is relativity (even its abc’s)
this helps.

MAN
VICTORIOUS OVER NATURE

The Doctor’s Bag

Editor’s Note: IT’S ONLY ABOUT HEALTH, SEX, DOPE, INSANITY...
. . ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE COLLEGE LIFE WORTH THE
BULLSHIT.

Dr. Arnold Werner, the young head of Michigan State University’s
psychiatrist and student health services, has been writing THE DOC-
TOR’S BAG for a year now, answering student’s questions every Wed-
nesday in MSU’s paper, the Michigan State News.

For his efforts, Werner has been denounced in the State Legislature.
His column was labelled ‘indescribable filth’ by right-wing, anti-smut
forces in the halls of government. But to students at Michigan State,
Werner’s weekly column has provided an entertaining, informative, ac-
curate counsel for the kind of problems that uptight legislators just don’t
run into much: drugs, the body, birth control, sexual techniques, phy-
siological and psychological problems, nutrition—the whole bit.

Werner is a certified psychiatrist, a medical doctor. He’s barely
past thirty. He also has a sense of humor.

If our readers find this column interesting and informative, we'll
continue it over the course of the year - let us know how you feel.

QUESION: I am bothered by the habit of masturbation. I try to fight it
off and am sometimes successful, but never entirely. Could this be harm-
ful to me in the future, and what can you suggest to help me with this
problem?

ANSWER: Feelings of guilt, anxiety and depression accompany mastur-
bation for a great many men and women. Disturbing feelings of this
nature often begin in childhood and are another reflection of the
way misinformation and repression has guided us in the development of
sexual attitudes. The vast majority of men, and a not much smaller
percentage of women, have masturbated for varying periods of time
during their sexually mature years.

Not only is masturbation harmless, but it is beneficial in situations
where intercourse is not available or not practical. The ability to mas-
turbate without feelings of guilt, anxiety or depression provides safe re-
lease for sexual tension and does not lead to any harmful effects. In fact,
women who have achieved orgasm through masturbation have a greater
tendency to achieve orgasm in sexual intercourse. The need for sexual
release is a highly individual matter. The person who experiences guilt
with masturbation might have problems of loneliness and fears that con-
tribute to his or her lowered self esteem. Help with these problems are
advisable.

Considering the long years of sexual maturity most of us spend single,
society should have stopped frowning on masturbation as a form of sexual
release a long time ago. This whole topic dealt with in greater depth in
a book by Albert Ellis called ‘‘Sex Without Guilt’? published in paper-
back by Grove Press. While Dr. Ellis goes overboard in parts of the book,
the chapters dealing with masturbation and petting are especially good.

QUESTION: I have an embarassing problem: I perspire heavily. I have
tried everything and have even perspired after taking a shower! I’m
afraid this is nervous perspiration. Can a doctor give me some sort of
pills? I’m ruining all of my clothes. Help!

ANSWER: There is considerable variation as to how much a person per-
spires. In addition to temperature, individual idiosyncracy plays a con-
siderable role. In certain medical conditions, perspiration is increased.
We've all experienced this with a fever, but people with hyperthyroidism
also perspire heavily. A visit to your doctor can usually rule this out.

Anxiety often causes increased sweating (perspiration always struck
me as being a little too dainty). If you are suffering from severe anxiety
you might waant to talk with a professional mental health worker. I
understand that Arrid extra dry is a particularly effective underarm de-
odorant. A word of caution: use it only under your arms or you run the
risk of skin irritation.

* * *

QUESTION: If the birth control pill is “medication,” are its effects any
way altered by the consumption of other medications such as aspirin,
cold tablets or perscribed drugs, such as penicillin, or by the consumption
of a alcohol which supposedly has increased effects when taken along
with medication?

ANSWER: None of the drugs which you mention will affect the action of
birth control pills. It would always be a wise move to tell a doctor you are
on the birth control pills at the time he is prescribing any new medication
for you. Certain medicines which have an effect on hormone production
might be contradicted if a person is on birth control pills. Incidentally,
it is probably not advisable for the nursing mother to be on oral contra-
ceptives, as the drug comes through in the milk.

ticle was written for The Bucknel-
lian last semester by Ken Wernick

and Lee Law School.

By KEN WERNICK

“We do not have a financial aid
program.”

Mr. Fritz Walling, director of ad-
missions, may have been partially
kidding when he said that, but in
actuality, the financial aid pro-
gram here for freshmen (and all
undergraduates) is quite deficient.

How many students need aid?
How many get it? How is it deter-
mined? How much money is there
available? From where does it
come? What are the particulars of
athletic grants-in-aid? How does
the University compare with other
schools in financial aid opportun-
ities? Could the University be-
come an “‘elitist’’ school in the
future?

The answers to these questions
paint the bleak picture of the Uni-
versity’s aid program. They also
pose new questions not only about
the future of the University, but
about the futures of all small pri-
vate colleges in the nation.

There were 1,770 students ac-
cepted here for the Class of 1974.
Of these, 751 needed financial aid
(based on the College Scholarship
Service Report recommendations).
The University offered only 187
students some form of aid (loan,
scholarship, work) for a total of
$338,500. But of course that doesn’t
mean that the University has $338,-
500 to give.

It is estimated that $175,000 of
that aid will actually be granted,
since not all of those students
awarded aid will confirm their ac-
ceptances.

The statistics are there — the
University offers aid to only 25%
of those students needing it; only
15%-20% of the student body will
receive aid next year.

Not Enough Money for Everyone in Need
University’s Financial Aid Picture Bleak

The determination of who ac-
tually receives aid is often a com-
plicated problem. Walling stated,
“The money goes as far as it can
go to the students with the best
academic promise.” Need is used
to determine the ‘‘pool” of poten-
tial recipients. The amount offered
then depends on academic quali-
fications rather than the degree of
need.

By action of the Board of Trust-
ees, the University has ‘‘coach-
recommended grants” for athletes.
These are based on the coaches’
discretion and need (which must be
shown by. the CSS form), and are
allocated once the student has been
accepted by the admissions office.
The yearly amount of these grants-
in-aid is sixteen times the tuition.
fees, and room costs. Twelve grants
are awarded for football, and four
for basketball. The awards, how-
ever, are only awarded consistent
with the financial needs of the stu-
dent, and could be spread among
many (more than 16) students in
athletics.

But in addition, the determina-

1969

tion of aid is a “political game.”
“We usually watch the pattern be-
tween the different departments,”
said Mr. Dick Skelton, associate di-
rector of admissions. “We try to
give the money to the best stu-
dents with respect to the needs
of the degree program.”

However, an outstanding class
of math majors could be awarded
significantly more money than a
mediocre class of civil engineers.
However, last year, the aid per
degree program (arts, sciences,
engineering, business) ranged from
21% (business) to 34% (sciences).

In the class of 1974, there has
been a cutback in financial aid,
due to overspending in aid during
the past two years. In addition,
no jobs will be available to in-
coming freshmen, because they
will have already been filled by
upperclassmen.

There is $610,000 currently bud-
geted for undergraduate scholar-
ship aid.

The income for aid is received
from two sources: unrestricted
University income (which is allo-

VERBAL SAT

cated to “scholarships” in the bud-
get), which accounts for 65% of
the total; and endowment, gifts
and federal programs, which make
up the additional 35%.

The University currently has an
endowment (i.e. funds that are in-
vested to produce income and to
which extent only the income can
be spent currently) of $20,000,000.
Two million dollars of that is des-
ignated for scholarship, of which
only $75,000 is income received on
that principal — only the income
received is actually used.

Endowment is a good estimate
for realizing the financial worth
of the University, and in compar-
ing the University with other
schools financially. But endowment
per student (endowment divided by
number of students) can give a
better idea of how financially-able
a school is to give aid to its stu-
dent body.

Yale, for example, has $47,508
endowment per student. Brown,
Cornell and Lafayette approximate
$15,000. Lehigh and Colgate ap-
proximate $10,000. Bucknell fol-

1969

lows with $7,500. Other schools,
like St. Lawrence, Dickinson, Tufts
and Virginia have approximately
$5,000 per student. An analysis of
these statistics shows the Univer-
sity on the low-end of the schools
with which she is competing for
students, many of whom need fi-
nancial assistance.

Compared to other schools, the
lack of sufficient financial aid here
is obvious. At Ivy League schools,
any student who demonstrates need
is awarded aid—here, only 25% of
those needing money get it. At
Princeton, Hamilton, Yale, Dart-
mouth, Amherst and Brown, better
than 407 of the total freshman
class receive aid. Wesleyan, Ro-
chester, Tufts, Penn, R. P. L.,
Lafayette, Trinity and Bowdoin
range from 30% - 35%. Ohio
Wesleyan. Carnegie Tech, Wil-
liams, Oberlin, Swarthmore, Col-
gate, and Franklin and Marshall
offer 25% of their total freshman
class aid. At 20% are Gettysburg,
Lehigh, Colby, Kenyon, Dickinson,
and Hobart. The University ac-

CA Initiates ‘Contact’

By JUNE CAFFREY

A new lecture-discussion series,
“Contact,” has been developed by
C.A. Its purpose is to promote the
exploration of topics not normally
discussed in class.

“Contact” differs from Firesides
and Livingroom dialogues in that it
is more flexible. Brevity and in-
formality will characterize all of
the sessions which are held every

Tuesday, alternating between New
Dorm and Swartz.

The program, initiated by Mary
Beth Pames, is open to any mem-
ber of the University or Lewisburg
community who wishes to speak on
a topic of interest. According to
Miss James, ‘‘the series is sup-
posed to get people who don’t have
much contact with students, to
share their knowledge and experi-
ence with them.”

Tristram’ Changes
Magazine Format

By MARY ANN BRANDT

The purpose of “Tristram,” the
literary magazine of the Univers-
ity, is to give creative students a
chance to see their work published.

With this in mind, a group of
students have reorganized Tristram
so that it will be published regular-
ly, at the end of each semester.

The Tristram staff is presently
looking for material for this se-
mester’s issue. Students are invited
to submit original poetry, short
stories, short plays, photographs,
and drawings. The due date for
this semester’s issue is October 21.

Materials can be submitted at the
English Office in Vaughan Litera-
ture Building or to Andrew Kraft
at B373. There will also be a box
in the library.

Tristram will award two prizes,
one for the best poem and one for
the best short story, in May. Each
prize will be $50. A panel of faculty
members and students will judge
the entries.

warded that, as a person becomes
more informed, whether it be
through a newscast, other media
or an event like a Colloquy, he
consequently feels as if he is act-
ually participating in the event—
finding solutions. With the theme
of Colloquy ’70 being “to think,
to question, to talk, to act. . .”,
do you feel that the ‘acting’ will
be shortchanged in view of this
reasoning?

H: I’ve heard that debate by
some very able people, and I don’t

think that it is the case of that
it has been the case. It can happen
that we can be so busy discussing
something that we feel that we’re
accomplishing something—but how
much worse to act. on something
before various angles have been
discussed?

B: I understand that you at-
tended Yale Divinity School. Any
fond recollections?

H: That’s been quite a while ago,
by the way. My recollections now
are certainly of the Divinity
School; but they’re also of New

Haven in general. It was the first
time, for an extended period, that
I had a chance to live in an urban
environment and work in various
aspects of city life.

Also, I worked in connection
with the undergraduate school at
Yale, and this combination of
thing i till very much in my
mind. Even in those days, Mayor
Lee had started different kinds of
urban renewal and plans for the
city which involved a lot of stu-
dents. I will say that some of the
interests that were spawned in

Blacks Provide Comments
Regarding Special Housing

By KARL BLAKE

Of 41 black students who are full-
time students at the university this
semester, twenty-three have chosen
to live in two houses in which the
priority in choosing rooms was
given to blacks. Thirteen black
men are living in Edwards House,
and ten women in Seventh St.
House. The first part of the follow-
ing interview was conducted with
three black residents of Edwards
House. The second part was con-
ducted with a black student who
lived in Edwards House for a week
and then decided to move into a
dormitory.

e & &

BUCKNELLIAN: What were the
conditions on the University campus
which led black students to feel
that this new arrangement was
necessary?

W: I’ve lived most of my life in
a black community, as have many
others here. Even regardless of
what your social status within that
community is, things are set up
very differently here.

X: I guess it’s a different set of
values and what you like to do, how
you like to function: music, danc-
ing social lingo all play a part.

W: When you come here, every-
thing you've been brought up with
just goes bdank, as if it had never
existed.

Z: A lot of the people up here
aren’t unfriendly; it’s just the cul-
tural barrier.

W: There are more cases of in-
difference than hostility.

X: It all involves so much it
would be very difficult to specify
any one item.

B: Why did you choose to come
to a school set in a rural environ-
ment like this University?

W: Well, personally, I came here
to get an education. I get the im-
pression that a lot of people have
come here to mess around for four
years at the “country club on the
Susquehanna.”

X: I heard it was a good school.
I figured I was going to get in any-
where I applied because I had'a
pretty good record in high school,
so I wasn’t really too concerned
about what college I picked. I’m
very sorry now that I was so pig-
headed. But the situation is prob-
ably pretty similar in any small
school.

Ww: Another thing is that this
place is supposed to have the big
reputation in white communities. I
don’t think any black people came
here for social reasons, whereas a
Jot of white people did.

X: I don’t know. Social life is
very important in order to keep
your academics up also.

W: Another thing this place offers
is that you get to see white people
in their natural habitat.

B: Everybody here is watching
tthe football game on television,
and many people on the hill are
watching the same game. Aren’t
small things like this some basis
for communication between the
races?

Y: Nobody’s talking about that.
It’s the cultural barrier, differences
in entertainment and things like
that. There isn’t anything to do on
a Friday or Saturday night.

W: Everybody has that problem
to a certain degree.

Y¥: Whites, though, can usually

relate to something like a fra- |

ternity band party.

X: You have to realize that this |

campus represents a specific set of
beliefs and values that are differ-
ent from ours. You know, people
ean watch foetball, but still every-

body doesn’t have the same tastes
as people at a fraternity, or as re-
presented by the kind of speakers
they invite to the campus. When
you add this to the fact that there’s
nothing for anybody to do up
heresy

W: There’s just no one thing you
ean put your hand on.

X: There’s just nothing that re-
minds you of home, absolutely noth-
ing.

B: Has this new housing arrange-
ment improved matters?

X: The main thing this place
offers is a more relaxed social at-
mosphere so that we can do what
we want without being made to feel
abnormal.

W: Definately the atmosphere is
much looser.

X: I’ve herd people say that no-
body up here is natural. One big
advantage of this house for any-
body would be the more relaxed
atmosphere.

B: Don’t fraternities offer such
an informal atmosphere?

W: In a sense we are a fraternity,
mainly for blacks.

X: A fraternity to me is kind of
an artificial place. I mean, do those
people take themselves seriously
I certainly can’t speak for the white
suburban student who comes here
and joins a fraternity, but believe
me, it would be impossible for me
to feel at home in a fraternity.

B: What more could be done to
improve conditions for black stu-
dents?

W: The sooner the University be-
gins to “integrate” the cultures and
bring black people and other mi-
nority groups into the mainstream
of campus life, the sooner this type
of thing won’t be as necessary. As
far as curriculum is concerned, in
many of the English courses, for
example, there is no literature by
black writers at all.

I mean, it’s nice to study Shakes-
pear in English history, but I'd like
to find out what’s been happening
in Africa, or in the non-white
nations or the world at times, be-
cause I’m sure that the culture of
those nations is very rich too.

X: The admission of more black
students would also help, although
it wouldn’t cure everything. As
things are, we just have to create
for ourselves a reasonable alterna-
tive to this campus.

W: The thing that the university
could do is to develop some type of
Afro-American studies. It’s aca-
demic and it’s very relevant at
this time, and it’s also very neces-
sary if we are ever to have any
true integration, culturally and
otherwise.

People have always spoken about
integration, but it’s only meant in-
tegration of black people with white
people. How about integration of
white people with black people?
White people don’t have to be pro-
Panther to integrate with black
people, or tell us how much they
love us or anything.

B: Why have some black people
chosen to live in dormitories?

Y: Some of them work up on the
hill. It would be very inconvenient
for them to get up early in the
morning and walk to Swartz Cafe-
teria.

X: When we had the meeting,
everybody, regardless of whether
or not they wanted to live in the
house, said we needed a house.

W: You’d have to ask everyone
how they feel. We can’t speak for
everybody

B: Why did you decide to leave
Edwards House?

Z: Well, I agree with the basic
idea behind it: the University be-
ing so overwhelmingly white and
apathetic that blacks could possibly
want to live together off the hill.

The atmosphere here is terribly
hard if you’re black and not used
to it. If you come from a black
neighborhood with black schools
it would be incredibly hard. The
idea is, you have to live here, You
realize that when school is out for
the day, you can’t go back to a

lack home or a black neighbor-
hood. The problem is always with
you; there’s no base to touch upon.

But the trouble is that the house
is not entirely black. Actually, Ed-
wards is just as dormant as any
place else. It isn’t completely
black, so there’s no overwhelming
spirit really, which is what I was
hoping for.

Even if every brother on campus
lived in Edwards House, there'd
still be a great deal more room,
and they couldn’t afford the loss of
space with the housing shortage
Anyway, federal law requires all
university housing to be integrated.

Also, I couldn’t hack the noise at
all. The guy in the room next to
mine played records constantly,
and the train went by every two
or three minutes. I can get more
work done here.

those years have continued.

B: Such as?

H: Maybe ‘interests’ is a poor
word there but, for me, the experi-
ence, there, was touching rather
early on some of these tremendous
issues that almost defy solution
and, yet, which we all have to work
on even if we’re not in the setting
—in one specific way, maybe my
experience there helps me (in the
essentially rural setting of Lewis-
burg) still be able to empathize
with the problems of the city and
even a large university.

B: How long have you been at
this University?

H: This is the beginning of my
fifth year. ‘

B: Generally, have you seen any
change in students here over that
time?

H: That’s an impossible question
to summarize an answer to, be-
cause it’s hard to know whether
student bodies have changed as a

coup or whether one’s circle of
acquaintanceships: or friendships
changes as he is here longer.

More students, though, do care
about more things. I despair.
sometimes, that we’re all
up in so many tough problems t
we sometimes seem to go in circles
in our thinking.

B: Do you think human morals
are changing?

H: You know, I used to have
real quick opinions on that kind
of thing, but I don’t think I do any
more. The morals haven’t chang:
as much as some of the su
ficial ways that people express
what they feel more deeply.

B: Returning to a line of Colloquy
thought, are speakers given any
broad guidelines before arriving
for the weekend? Are they told
what to say or how to say it?

H: In a meeting like the Inter-
national pr am, there are very
few speakers, and each
knows exactly what his a
is. In the f meeting, though
where there are any-where from 30
to 70 people attending, the people
have relatively less direction. They
do get a theme and more or less
work on it for themselves.

B: Do you think that the Fall
Colloquy, because of its great
number of speakers, is weaker
than the Spring, International Col-
loquy?

H: No. The Fall program is a
distinctive one and, with all its
weakness, it has been inquired af-
ter and adopted by many schools
around this part of the country
Some of us involved in the first one
(in 1966) felt that it should be the
last because it was a unique ex-
perience. The student interest and
demand, though, caused it to be
repeated—that interest was even
stronger in the next two years and,
now, we’re in our fifth year.

H: Possibly a more specific
theme and more of a sense of stat-

A stranger clad in a short-sleev-

‘Reluctant’ Success Puzzles and Disappoints

Survey Raises Doubts Regarding Frosh-Week Impact

By LAURIE TYNAN

Features Editor’s Note: Fresh-
man Week “‘isn’t all it used to be,”
or so one gathers in this survey of
opinion from those who took part
in all its various activities.

Radical changes have swept the
Freshman Orientation Program
over the last four years from the
“weeklong drag’’ seniors describe
to the overwhelming success soph-
omores experienced. An enthusias-
tie Orientation staff expected that
the Freshman Week Program,
drawn up for the threefold purpose
of introducing freshmen to other
freshmen, to upperclassmen, and to
the ‘University experience,’ would
be as much of a suc s last
year’s. Instead, the ‘“‘reluctant’”
success that materialized puzzled
and seemed to disappoint those

volunteers who worked toward cre-
ating a stimulating Freshman
Week.

The timidity of so many fresh-
men impressed many orientation
leaders, such as Schley Wraight
who observed, ‘‘They’re so hung-
up!” during the Introductory
Micro-lab, August 31. The enthusi-
asm of the upperclassmen never
seemed to wear off on the fresh-
men, who came away from the
Introductory Session with the im-
pression that something “‘silly” had
happened.

The three scheduled discussion
groups went from bad to worse as
freshmen listened to dull presenta-
tions by faculty speakers and found
themselves ‘‘discussed to death”
by week’s end.

Tim Hornbrook found the discus-

sions overdone when, by Thursday,
they covered the ‘‘same old thing.”
Many freshmen deemed the Satur-
day session useless since it requir-
ed freshmen to try to compare
High School to College on the basis
of one Friday’s worth of classes.

Of the minority of students who
came, Karen Olsson called # “‘un-
fair’’ to expect freshmen to be able
to comment on classes after such
a brief encounter with them. Most
freshmen, however, had already
dropped out of the activities by
week’s end and opted not to bother
with the final session.

Freshman Bill Bohlen thought
Freshman Week was too long and
became unnecessary as freshmen
came to feel more oriented to the
campus. Apparently many other
freshmen agreed and drifted away,

Orientation Satire Jabs
Frosh-Week Adventures

By JACKIE STUBBA

Yes, Virginia, there really is a
Freshman Orientation. Even here
in downtown Lewisburg, where
you’d least expect it, there lurks
that traditional curse-an orientation
program designed to totally confuse
innocent young freshmen. This year
being no different from the past,
we freshmen courageously under-
went four days of strange adven-
ture.

It all began one dark cloudy night
while incoming freshman slept

comfortably in peace, naively un-
aware that somewhere several Uni-
versity staff members were secret-
ly creating another orientation pro-
gram .Carefully planned and elabor-
ately organized, they knew just
what they were doing on that fatal
night.

The first day was ‘‘arrival.” Ner-
vous freshmen hurried in to meet
their roommates, anxious to be-
come best buddies-that is, after
conniving their way to grab the
better bed. Moans and cheers echo-
ed through the halls, reflecting our
feelings toward the rooms. Mys-
teriously, there seemed to be an
s of moans.

As we lunched with our parents
we were pleasantly surprised to
discover the good food produced
by the cafeteria. The parents com-
mented frequently, approving the
fine quality of food that we would
be eating over the next four years.
Yet many freshmen could not help
sensing a forewarning doom, for
this meal had all the markings of

guessed what he was creating. All
went fine until one Michaelangelo
wouldn’t stop molding until he had
finished it to his satisfaction, des-
pite the fact that we had already
guessed his object five minutes
before that.

At intervals during this session
we talked in groups relating our
personal feelings about the ex-
periences. This was to develop sen-
sitivity and release our inhibitions.
However, at one point, someone
became so open and revealing that
it turned into an hour of “True
Confessions.”

Also scheduled for orientation
was a picnic and meeting of the
deans at Cowan. Other groups had
informed us that it was great, so
my group became anxious for it.

When our turn finally came we
noisily boarded the buses under
foreboding dribbles of rain. In time
everyone was settled for the long
trip, chatting happily with possible
date prospects. The buses took off.
Three minutes and four blocks
later, we found ourselves piling
out into Tustin Gym. Of course by
then the rain was pouring down.
As if that weren’t bad enough, once
inside the gym they segre:
girls from the guys into different
rooms. It was quite an experience
eating a picnic lunch on the gym
floor desperately trying not to
notice the basketballs bounce past.

Thursday morning freshmen re-
ported to Vaughan Lit. auditorium
for a series of tests designed to re-
veal important information. The at-
mosphere was tense, we were anx-
ious to do well on our first college
test. The questions were tricky:
“Do you walk faster or slower than
most people? . . “Do you usual-
ly, sometim or never go up
stairs taking two at a time?”... .
“Do you like your carrots cooked
or raw?”. Some freshmen worried
in depth about the implication be-
hind each question, the hidden
meanings threatened subtley.

The fifth day was indeed mome-
tous, for the upperclassmen had
finally all arrived and college had
officially begun. Did the freshmen
class show signs of alarm or su-
spicion?. Did we panic on that first
day of regular classroom routine?
Indeed we did not! Ready and
aware, we fell into the college pat-
tern quite easily; for within us lay
the great confidence that if we
could survive four long days of
freshmen orientation, we were
ready to conquer the world.

making poor attendance one of the
problems facing the Freshman
Week Committee.

Geoff Blood, a committee mem-
ber, attributed some of the disin-
terest to mistakes and inexperience
of the orientation leaders and to
activities that were not as ‘novel’
to freshmen as expected. Many had
already experienced sensitivity ses-
sions and some, such as Tim Horn-
brook, felt that aspects of inter-
personal relationships were already
a familiar thing. He felt that he
was not being informed or stimulat-
ed to think about aspects of the
University.

Many other freshmen felt that
they would rather have spent their
time meeting people, and indicated
that this should have. been the
major objective of Freshman Week.
Geoff Blood explained that, since
the University is people, this part
of Freshman Orientation was im-
portant. Unfortunately, certain
types of activities set up for this
purpose failed miserably, as in the
case of faculty speakers.

Indeed, many of the activities
the freshmen enjoyed were those
which did encourage freshmen to
meet people. Both Hornbrook and
Bohlen praised the introductory as-
pects of Freshman Week, and Rick
Varner considered the second
Micro-lab so effective that he ex-
pressed an interest in holding other
Micro-labs throughout the semes-
ter.

Generally, the events that fresh-
men liked most, such as trips to
Cowan, dinners with Lewisburg
families, and the WVBU Special,
all tended to be unstructured ac-
tivities that encouraged people to
meet.

In viewing the Freshman Week
Program from the stance of an up-
perclassman, it is difficult to under-
stand how the background of the
new freshmen affected their at-
titude toward the activities during
Freshman Week. The act of going
through the ‘‘college experience”
can create a “generation gap’ of
sorts between upperclassmen and
freshmen, causing an Orientation
Program to look good on paper but
fail to measure up to the degree of
sophistication of incoming fresh-
men.

Geoff Blood indicated that if any-
one comes up with an ultimate
Freshman Orientation Program, it
is probably by chance. Relying on
previous successes can be mislead-
ing, for the very activities which
last year’s freshmen praised, were
generally panned this year. Ap-
parently, the liberal portions of
luck and change which created
last year’s success failed to com-
bine in quite the same way to
create a stimulating Freshman
Orientation Program for 1970

‘Woodstock’ Review Renders
Economic-Social Commentary

By DEAN LANDEW

Features Editor’s Note: One
learns that “Woodstock” is more
than a movie in this semi-review
of this week’s Campus Theatre
feature.

It’s been over a year since the
world was shocked by the unique
reality of counter-culture in Ameri-
ca-the Woodstock Music and Arts
Festival. We all know about the
mud, the dope and the music, and
whether you think that Woodstock
was the greatest humanity trip or
the most disgusting display of he-
donism ever is now passed. Even to
ask why it happened is unimpor-
tant.

The fundamental questions about
Woodstock which are important con-
cern far greater economic and so-
cial issues. Regardless of the ideal-
ism of those 350,000 people, certain
pragmatic limitations were  in-
herent and can now be viewed
rationally. Primarily, the festival
was finite. Everyone knew that
they would be there for three days
and thus, the rain and mud be-
came tolerable circumstances, as
did the limited sanitation facilities.

No matter what is said about the
universal nonviloence of Woodstock,
the expert work of the imported
doctors kept a passively drugged
crowd in good order by taking care
of the bad ‘trips.

Economically, Woodstock has
proved to be one of the all-time
financial coups. Between posters,
t-shirts, bumper stickers, a three-
record album (with a 2-record set
probably on the way) and a movie,

the four producers plan to stand
well in the black after predicting
a 1-2 million loss.

Yes, it was the best of counter-
culture, at least the biggest. But
to be sensible, two general obser-
vations about Woodstock should be
acknowledged: that it could’ve
never come off without the help,
regardless of degree, of the out-
side Establishment; and that Wood-
stock now is a name synonymous
with dollar, and let’s all be thank-
ful when the economic exploitation
of this middle-class, white pheno-
menon ends.

Since this is a movie review,
I'll say a few words about Wood-
stock (Warner Bros.). I liked it.
On the levels of joy and sensuality,
it’s good stuff. Most of the movie is
devoted to the music, which is gen-
erally pretty fair. In terms of the
medium, the Who come off the best.
Their audio-visual impact is tre-
mendous. Country Joe’s “‘Fixin’ to
Die” rag is a classic performance,
and Crosby, Stills and Nash add an
inspiring dash of aesthetics, even
though they’re a bit out of tune.
You get flashes of skinny-dipping,
dope, Port-o-Sans, mud slides, and
interviews with freaks and town
folks along the way. What else can
I say? Taken at face value, it’s
highly recommendable entertain-
ment. As a documentary, partic-
ularly in light of what we now can
infer, it’s one-sided.

So when you see it at the Campus
this week, just think of all the free
love, humanity and togetherness
you'll be paying for:

Aid Increases Unlikely

(Continued from Page 3)
cording to these statistics compiled
by the CELB Freshman Class Pro-
files (1965-67) has only 13% of its
freshman class on aid.

Carnegie Mellon had a freshman
class‘ of °800 last year—one hun-
dred more than here. Yet they of-
fered more than $1,000,000 in aid to
that class (compared to $338,000 by
the University), and were able to
put 80% of those students needing
aid on their assistance list.

But what does this mean in
terms of the future? How can we
relate the lack of adequate finan-

LENA POOPY

cial aid to the University’s future.

An article in the New York Times
stated that Ivy League schools are
beginning to have financial dif-
ficulties and that they are fearing
that they may become “elitist uni-
versities’—only for the very rich
and the very poor.

Mr. John Zeller, vice president
for business and finance, said
“There is a real danger of Buck-
nell becoming elitist. But if we put
the emphasis on giving money to
the best qualified students, who are
spread out on the economic scale,
there is a lesser danger. If we use

= AR RITE ATE I

our money, however, to bring in
disadvantaged students solely on
that basis, we run the risk of cut-
ting out the middle class.”

The future is not bright. Zeller
said, ““The demands on the budget
are so great that it is unlikely that
there will be substantial increase
in scholarship. This is primarily
due to inflation and other costs.”

The richly-endowed schools are
beginning to worry about their lack
of aid for all students needing it,
and “elitism.” The University has
been there for years, and the fore-
cast is that it will be there for some
years to come.

Bison Receiv

er Works

In Defensive Backfield

By KEN DOAK

Although the Herd dropped a 10-3
decision to Temple Saturday one
bright spot was the all-around play
of senior Paul Gilewicz. He hauled
in seven passes at split end, and
turned a good effort at corner-
back on defense.

Paul felt that “we hurt ourselves
more than Temple hurt us,” and
hopes that the mistakes can be re-
duced for tomorrow’s game with
tough Baldwin-Wallace. ‘“‘We’ll be
put to the test this week,” he said.

Gil will have his work cut out
for him at the corner as he will
be covering Tom Graham, a 9.6
sprinter and a fine receiver. And
because the Bisons use only three
deep men, there won’t be much
help available.

This is the first year Gilewicz
has been used on defense, and he
feels it is more challenging than
offense. ‘‘There’s a lot of pressure
on the corner.”

Due to his lack of game experi-
ence at the position, he’s having
some trouble at reading plays
quickly enough and reacting to
them.

Paul credits Coach Larry Land
ini and safety Gene Luccarelli with
speeding his development (and
soph Jim Cassidy’s) on defense.
According to him, ‘‘Luccarelli helps
us quit a bit. We're actually ro-
okies back there. He’s taught us a
fot.’’

On offense, he prefers the three-
end offense the Bisons are employ-

ing this season over the three-back
formation of previous years. With
Gilewicz, Cassidy, tight-end Jay
Griffin, and back-up receiver Bob
Ciperson all catching the football,
there’s less defensive pressure on
each man.

As Paul commented, ‘“‘It’s better
having three really good receivers
in there. We complement each other
well.”

He also gave a share of the credit
for the passing attack to improved
pass-blocking and to QB Greg Dov-
iak. “I think Greg’s throwing the
ball well this year.”

In preparation for tomorrow’s
game, Gilewicz is working on get-
ting off the ball quicker, and on
improving his deep patterns. He
realizes that a deep threat is neces-
sary to loosen up the defense.

After starting as a running back
his freshman y: Paul was moved
outside early in his sophomore sea-
son and found he enjoyed the role
of a receiver better.

Despite the injuries which have
victimized Gilewicz in his first two
season’s as a Bison, he has been
the workhorse of the pass catch-
ing corps

He has led the Bisons in recep
tions the past two seasons, and
judging from the opener, he is well
on his way to a third straight team-
leadership. If Bucknell is to put to-
gether a successful season, a lot
will depend on the pass-catching,
and defensive play, of Paul Gile-
wicz.

We really don’t think you'll need
a dictionary or a copy of Who’s
Who’s to read our first top 20 of the
1970 season. Most of the fecas are
probably all too familiar.

Texas is still unchallenged for
that Number One position, and the
Longhorns will solidify the top spot
with a 28-point spanking of Texas
Tech this Saturday. Sixth-ranked
Notre Dame will be waiting to boil
the Fifteenth-rated Riveters of Pur-
due, the only game the Irish lost
during the regular 1969 season. The
“spoiler” will be played in South
Bend, and it looks like a 5-point re-
venge victory for Notre Dame.

Though a little late in appearing
onstage for the 1970 football season,
the Ohio State Buckeyes plan to
make up for lost time. Texas A & M
is the first guest, and they'll be
treated rather poorly. The Bucks
will whip the Aggies by 22 points.

Baldwin - Wallace Gridders

By RICHARD VROON

The Bison gridmen are preparing
to face one of their most difficult
opponents tomorrow, Baldwin-Wal-
lace. Not much evidence is needed
to confirm such a statement, for
BW has lost only two games in the
past two years. They yielded an
average of only 66 yards per game
last year, while gaining an average
of 431 yards. Baldwin-Wallace’s ex-
plosive offense, primarily of the
wide open type, averaged about 40
points a game. To compensate for
their only weakness, lack of size,
BW has tremendous speed which is
difficult to defend against

Head Coach Fred Prender plans
to send the same starting squad
that fought Temple against Bald-
win-Wallace. According to the
coach, injuries so far have been
mostly confined to the bumps and
bruises evpected from a_hard-
fought football game. The coaches
and the team have been working
very hard in preparation. While
improvement is sought in all phases
of the game, Coach Prender feels
it is especially necessary to im-
prove the Bisons’ offense. The Bi-
sons need to get the ball to the
outside on runs, which they seldom
accomplished against Temple’s
zone defense. Meanwhile, the de-
fense hopes to hold opponents to
ten points or less, as they accomp-
lished in the Temple game

Coach Prender feels the Bisons

ayed hard and never gave up

t Saturday, and with the team’s

ale and desire holding up well,

he feels that his squad will put

forth the same hard effort and
spirit against Baldwin-Wallace.

/ Players of the Week

ee

John Klenovic of Niles, O. and
Joe DiOrio of Somers Point, N. J
were named Bucknell players of
the week for outstanding play in
last Saturday’s 10-3 loss to Temple

Klenovic, a center,
offensive award for his excellent
blocking against the Owls. The 5-10,
200-pound junior received a high
grade on the films and put in a
top notch game against much larg-
er ponents.

Coach Fred Prender said, “John
did a tremendous job. He was our
regular center last year, but has
been pressed for a starting berth in
pre-season. John worked hard to
keep his slot and it has paid off.

DiOrio was cited for outstanding
play at defensive tackle. The 6-2,
210-pound junior played the entire
game on defense and was in on a
great number of tackles

Prender said, “Joe played a
great game. He gained a lot of ex-

‘It’s A Beautiful Day’
Tries to Save Concert

By MICKEY SINKUS

Amid heat, lightning, sweat and
paper airplanes, Miles Davis and
“It’s a Beautiful Day” poured out
the initial sounds of the 1970-71 Uni-
versity concert schedule. The two
performances, so different in style,

nevertheless had one thing in com-
mon—their music was refreshingly
unique

Somehow, Miles Davis found the
stage and led his group in a 46
minute jam session. For ten min-
utes, shared by his trumpet, a sax,
and an organ, an alien form of
jazz, (probably termed progressive)
fell upon a startled but agreeable
audience. But after the same ten

minute shift was repeated another
four times, a much too sophisti-
cated Davis found his way off the
stage amid cool or even cold ova-
tion that he barely deserved.

As is quite possible when two
persons write on the same subject,
opposing views present themselves.

Free Conversation Keynotes Colloquy

By DAVID HAMMER

One tends to generally character-
ize a Colloquy’s ‘‘success’”’ on the
basis of involvement; but perhaps
Resident Colloquy 1970 is best de-
senibed in terms af active partici-
pation, for it was this trait which
especially marked the fall weekend.

One innovation which sparked
such participation was the lack of
panels and long-winded lecturing,
and the presence of professional
guests with few stated gnments
and a real interest in fielding ques-
tions from an interested audience
or performing in such a way that
one could sense they enjoyed their
work.

Dr. Herbert Puryear
inquiries in his ‘ ience and the
Psychic Mind’’ seminar ranging
from the analysis of dreams to the
workings of the ouija board, while
other speakers like Professor Tran
Van Dinh of SUNY likewise left
ample time for open, diverse, ques-
tions on such topics as involvement
in Vietnam and revolution. Both,
thus, advanced the theme of “free
conversation” to all who attended
and, as did the other guests, added
to an atmosphere which can best
be described as ‘‘open.”

Food Committee Recommends Veto
Of Proposed Dining Arrangement

By TERRY ELLIS

Based on findings of Sept. 22, the
Dining Halls Advisory Committee
has recommended that no change
should occur in the present dining
hall arrangement
The decision was made following
an informal student opinion survey
and an examination of a proposed
dining change submitted by Pete
Holmes.

In a memorandum responding to
an ABS motion recommending a
possible reassignment of dining ar-
rangements, John Dunlop, Dean of
Student Affairs and chairman of
the Committee, stated: “I am sat-
isfied that the Committee has done
its work well, and based on their
findings, I cannot encourage a re-

Faculty Deliberates Senate Plan

Another stepping stone was cross-
ed early yesterday evening when
the faculty met for a continuing
discussion of the Senate proposal.

The motion on the floor is to con-
sider the entire proposal as a unit.
In essence, President Charles
Watts said that after the October
5 vote next week, there would still
be more discussion on the proposal.

Before the floor was opened for
questions, President Watts an-
nounced that the Andrew Mellon
Foundation had granted $200,000 for
the “enhancement of the faculty”
over a three year period.

For 75 minutes, the 80 odd faculty
members and 5 ABS representa-
tives sat and followed Roberts
Rules of Order as the floor was
open to questions.

Semantics and correct wording
were the main concerns last night
and even President Watts agreed

The four-man committee headed

ROTC Enacts New
Options for Cadets

By NANCY GRDEN

Two changes in policy for ROTC
cadets have recently been enacted,
announced Captain V. J. Tedesco,
Jr.

As of September 1, all ROTC
graduates will be permitted to de-
lay active duty up to two years for
the purpose of earning a Master’s
degree.

In the past, ROTC cadets ac-
cepting a commission in the reg-
ular army had difficulty in getting
approval to go to graduate school,
and those with ROTC scholarships
had to rank within the top 5% of
all scholarship cadets to receive
permission to go right to graduate
school without serving at least two
years in active duty.

in the doc-

thority” of the University. Presi-
dent Watts said that it “tends to
follow reasonable action and wis-
dom. We are dealing with a kind
of constitutional document.’’ He
saw the need to be precise where
the word authority was concerned.

In the necessity for faculty mem-
bers to have a voice, Professor J.
Peeled said ‘it would not be de-
sirable to burden the faculty as a
body with increased responsibility.
In practice, it’s going to depend on
willingness to make it work.”

Professor Spielman commented
on the question of division of labor.
He said, “Here is a matter in which
this organization will have a ten-
dency to worry about conflict.”

In answer to a question concern-
ing the ABS role in the studying of
the Senate proposal, ABS Presi-
dent Dave Lacey said that he
wanted to wait until the procedure
had been deliberated in the faculty.

However, Lacey said he was dis-
appointed that the Senate proposal
is not the original one. ‘One of the
original concerns is that it was not
clear how much patticipation the
students had except on some of the
committees. One concern among
the students is that we might have
too many students involved . . .
We do need more time to consider
it.”

Lacey mentioned that it was dif-
ficult for ABS to deliberate on the
Senate proposal because of the one
week time deadline before the fac-
ulty comes to a vote on the motion
and because of the difficulty of
procuring the document on a wider
basis.

ent evidence that such a move
would go against the apparent
wishes of upperclassmen and fresh-
men.”

Results of the Committee’s sur-
vey seemed to indicate that of the

of La

Many freshmen in Roberts also
recommended a change enabling
those on the hill to eat break
in Swartz. Miss Pluemacher, Di-
rector of Food Services, indicated,
however, that it would not be pos-
sible to accomodate more people
in Swartz without an equal number
leaving.

Among upperclassmen _ polled,
were many women in Hunt Hall
and students in International House.
The general conse was that a
change would not greatly increase
interaction and that there
seemed little need for reassign-
ment.

In regards to the proposal submit-
ted by Pete Holmes, the Committee
felt that the disruption of the stu-
dents caused by a change would be
greater than possible interaction
between upperclassmen and fresh-
men.

Because of the number of stu
dents involved and the present ratio

‘Bucknellian’ Receives Honors
For Second Semester Issues

The Bucknellian, has been award-
ed a first class honor rating by the
National Critical Service of the As-
sociated Collegiate Press.

The award is based on the an-
alysis of the newspapers published
during second semester of the 1969-
70 year, under the editorship of
Paul Osher with Eric Riess as ex-
ecutive editor.

This is the third consecutive se-
mester that the newspaper has
achieved the first class rating the
highest rating possible on the basis
of scorebook points.

In addition to the ratings by
points, the student newspaper was
awarded marks of distinction for
outstanding achievement in the cat-
agories of content and coverage
and editorial leadership.

It was the first time that The

Bucknellian received marks of dis-
tinction in any catagor:

Based at the Univers
nesota, School of Journalism, the
NCS-ACP rates collegiate news-
papers from all-over the country.
After classfying publications ac-
cording to the number of times the
newspaper is published and the size
of the schools, all entries are
judged .comparitively with first
class ratings given to the best in
each group.

Newspapers are judged in the
major catagories of content and
coverage, writing and editing, edi-
torial leadership, physical appear-
ance, and photography.

Points are awarded in each cata-
gory with marks of distinction
awarded for “outstanding achieve
ment.”

The Meaning of Commitment

This University needs to commit
itself to reality. We need to leave our
world of illusions and confront the real
world which we have been artfully dodg-
ing for so long.

More than anything else, this Uni-
versity needs to make itself emotionally
aware of the fact that there is a world
beyond these hallowed halls, which does
affect the(University’s affairs and ought
to affect its structures.

We must widen our recruiting ef-
forts and end our competition with
schools like Harvard and Princeton for
equally qualified black students. We
must look harder for the qualified stu- an
dents, searching them out. Funds for
scholarship aid cannot be diverted from
a white student body which now only re-
ceives aid for thirteen per cent of its
numbers. We must realize that we are
not an elitist institution, but are on our
way to establishing a sort of second-
string aristocracy. We must begin to
meet the real needs of the University.

In denying ourselves the stimulus of the hive.

ee eI IE SS I SE

a faculty and student body drawn from
diverse backgrounds and cultures, the
University is depriving itself of an im-
portant source of cultural development
and intellectual growth. By failing to
adapt its structures to deal with the real
problems of American society, we risk
losing experiences beneficial in future
dealings with reality. The greatest loss
will be suffered by students who, raised
all their lives in white, upper middle class
bastions, will not be able to deal with
the complexities of people.

It is high time that we open our-
selves to all the possibilities inherent in
expanding,
must realize that $600,000 in scholar-
ship aid is far too small a sum for a
school which prides itself on its academic
capabilities. We must make a real effort
to change structures and procedures de-
veloped solely for suburbia. We must
meet the needs of the rest of society.
We should aspire to something more
than being the most WASPish school in

diversified world. We

Saber Rattling

By RICK VANCE

Ya know, the strangest things happen to me at night. It was two
in the morning. I was strolling leisurely between the botany building and
Kress, and suddenly there it w a flashing, disc shaped slivver of light.
It hovered overhead then landed not thirty feet away. A little creature
about four feet tall in his unstockinged feet, one-eyed, large-eared, and
orangish-green in color, emerged from the craft, walked confidently to-
ward me, and commanded in perfect English, “Take me to your leader.”

h ader?”’

‘Yes, Earthman. I'd like to see Richard, ah let me see now, Richard
Dickens.”

“You mean Richard Nixon.”

“yeah, that’s the name. Take me to see him.”

Make up your mind. Do you wanna see Nixon or our leader?”’

‘| wasn’t aware there was any difference between the two.”

You haven’t been here very long, have ya buddy?”

‘No, Ig s not, “he replied, and so saying, he motioned me to enter
the craft utes later we were hovering over the White House, and fi-
nally, having spotted Nixon’s office, we glided through its open window

it was 2 } window) where we discovered the President de-

vouring his nightly snack of Wheaties and prune juice. He didn’t appear

t surprised by our sudden intrusion nor was he shocked by the

rather singular appearance of my companion. (He did, however, examine

me thoroughly then ordered me to leave. My beard and sideburns, I im-

agine, were disturbing to the man.) I did manage to hear most of their
conversation from the adjoining room.

“Ym from the planet Pluto. I’d like to ask you. . rs

“How many do you desire?”

“How many what?’

“Troops, my esteemed companion.”

“I didn’t come here for troops. I just. . .”

“Listen, I am the President. You can rest assured of that. As Presi-
dent of these United States, I can spare only fifty thousand at the present
time. The remaining portion of America’s finest young men are tied up
all over the rest of this planet. Where did you say you were from?” He
grabbed a pencil and pad off his desk.

“Pluto.”

“Would you please do me a service of spelling that?”

“PLU-T0.”

“Are you quite certain, quite sure, that there aren’t two t’s in that?
_. . Pardon me one moment. I’ll ask Spiro. He’s across the hall viewing
television . . . Ah Spiro, Mister Agnew. Does Pluto have one or two t’s?”

“Huh?”

“J said does Pluto have one or two t’s?”

“J dunno. I’m not much of a golfer.”

The President turned toward the alien. ‘‘You'll have to excuse the
Vice President. He’s watching this movie entitled, “John Doe Goes to
College” and it’s understandably upsetting for him to watch as a good
American boy turns into a bum like the rest of those college youngsters.”
He reached into his desk drawer, pulled out a miniature plastic American
flag and pinned it over the planet Pluto located on the right extremity of
the wall map situated directly behind his desk. “Gee Whiz,” he exclaimed,
“T wasn’t planning on getting our boys there till my third term!”

Course Guide
To the Editor;

The following is a copy of a me-
morandum sent to all faculty mem-
bers. I would also invite comments
from any interested students.

ane

As Editor of last year’s Bucknell
Course Guide and a member of the
Committee on Professor and Course
Evaluation, I believe that in some
way the students at Bucknell should
have a clearer description of cour-
ses, especially in relation to dif-
ferences in presentation and cover-
age of material by various mem-
bers of the faculty. Our effort last
year produced a mediocre result,
due in great part to limitations in
manpower and the fact that this
was a first-time effort, without the
benefits of previous experiences. I
do believe, however, that the Buck-
nell Course Guide was a useful doc-
ument which was fairly presented.

By general consensus of the Com-
mittee on course evaluation, the
effort put into such a major produc-
tion is too great to try and produce
another version of the Guide this
year. However, I would still hope
that something along these lines
can be done. While discussing this
problem with Professor Santulli, it
was suggested that instead of stu-
dents trying to critique classes, our
efforts might be more profitable
directed in assembling faculty
opinions of courses.

If each professor were to write a
summary of how he or she planned
to present the course material, the
coverage for the subject offered by
the course, and possibly a partial
listing of what is expected of stu-
dents (prerequisites and assign-
ments during the semester), the
student would then have a more
rational basis upon which to choose
courses and professors, and the
professors would, most likely, have
classes more responsive to their
expectations and teaching methods.

I would sincerely appreciate all
reactions, comments, encourage-
ment, and/or criticism of this plan.
Thank you for your consideration
of this matter.

From the Editor’s Desk

It has been postulated that 6 million murders had little of the
expected impact on the German people, because the Nazis man-
aged to transform the act from one of horror to that of the com-
monplace, the banal, the trite.

This week fifty Americans will die in Vietnam (for America),
yet if you look closely at your newspaper, any newspaper, you'll
be hard pressed to find even a column on Vietnam (THE TIMES
9-24 had none). After six long years fifty boys/week has become
commonplace, almost banal, dare we say trite.

GUEST COLUMN

Here We Go Again

By STEVE BECKER.

Nixon is ready to do it again. As of the writing of this article (9/23)
Nixon has been talking of sending American forces into Jordan on the
pretex of evacuating the 400 or so Americans (including the 38 hijacked
American hostages who are apparently hidden in Amman) that are now
in that country. The fact of the matter is that except for the hostages,
the Palestinian commandos have offered to give the Americans safe pas-
sage out of Jordan. (It is the Jordanian troops that are endangering
‘American lives by shelling Amman, in addition to their horrible and in-
discriminate shelling of refugee camps and shooting of civilians in a
vain attempt to flush out the commandos).

There must then be other motives for the U.S.’s sudden interest in
the fate of Jordan while still maintaining a strong alliance with Israel.
The first thing that comes to mind is U.S. business interests-OIL- that
would hardly be secure if the commandos did actually gain full control
of Jordan. Then, too, Nixon does not intend to stand idly while the pos-
sibility exists for the formation of the first Arab Marxist state, and he is
apparently thinking about stopping this formation by the usual means -
force.

Peculiarly enough, Russia and the U.S., (as well as Israel and some
of the Arab nations), have a common desire to see that Hussein stays in
power (Hussein, in his long time precarious, moderate position, insti-
gated this new civil conflict by firing his civilian cabinet and installing
a twelve-man military cabinet, which then set out to crush the com-
mandos). What possible interests could the U.S. and U.S.S.R. have in
common? Power and influence in the area. An independent Marxist
regime would benefit neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union: in fact, it
would only benefit the Palestinians (who make up over 60% of the pop-
ulation of Jordan).

Israel, too, would like to see the commandos squelched and not so
much because she fears their military might but rather because Israel
would then be forced to deal with the Palestinians. But Israel is not ready
to make concessions to the Palestinians. (There will not be peace in the
Middle East until the refugees are readmitted to Israel as full citizens
or at least until Israel and the refugees reach some acceptable agreement.
Agreements with Arab leaders such as Nasser and Hussein will never
solve the basic problem).

There is another way, more cynical though I believe partially ac-
curate, to look at the whole Middle East problem. That the U.S. strongly
supports the Arab nations, which might lead us to the same conclusions
about their actions. In addition, the US., U.S.S:R:, Israel, and theU:A:R:
are all (in varying degrees) desirous of keeping the commandos from
gaining full control in Jordan In short, the above considerations might
lead us to believe that the Palestinian commandos are doing something
right.

Even though many of the Arab leaders are not happy about the civil
war in Jordan they have stated definitely that they want no U.S. involve-
ment. Apparently they have learned the lesson of the times; there is no
such thing as a temporary U.S. involvement. If the Nixon Administration
should sent troops and/or arms to Jordan to settle the civil conflict, it
will yet be another example of the United States imposing its greedy will
on others.

eee et Re

P.S.: The events of the last few days don’t change in the least Ad-
ministration philosophy in the Middle East (apparently arms commit-
ments to Jordan have already been made). If at some later date the
commandos’ threat to Hussein’s power should increase, it is becoming
clearer that the U.S. would not hesitate to intervene in a more dramatic
way.

Gleanlings Discuss Art;
Stress Bodily Freedom

By LAURIE BUTCHER
‘We want to live our philosophy
the way man did before life got
all fragmented,” says Sonja Zarek
of the Gleanlings, who was here
last weekend for Colloquy.

Miss Zarek studied piano, then
voice and considered a career as
an art song singer, but felt there
was little opportunity for communi-
catian in that field. At a camp in
Washington State she wrote her
first folk song and decided she liked
it better.

James Clouser, her husband, had
an urge to dance but at first didn’t
recognize it for what it was. The
son of a football coach, he went to
the Eastman School of Musie and
studied composition and dance. He
disliked dancing with classical com-
panies because repeating the same
dance every night lacked any real
communication.

“We met two and a half years
ago teaching summer school,”
James said. “I was lecturing on
music and dance - she was ac-
companying him on the piano. She
also plays the guitar, so I danced
to folk songs for the first time. I
changed the lecture to Religion
and the Dance and we were mar-
ried during the lecture.”

They elaborated the wedding ser-
vice, took it to an agent and began
performing at colleges. He is now
teaching at Connecticuit College.
He said, “We used to have goals,
but not now, we do whatever
evolves.”

They have no children and do
not intend to have any. “Bringing
up a child is a career and it’s not

our career,” said Jim. ‘‘We’d have
to give up our career and so be-
come bitter, which would be re-
flected in the child. Besides there
are too many already.”

Miss Zarek added, ‘“‘I never grew
up with kids and don’t know how to
relate to them. I couldn’t give my-
self-I’m selfish with my time. Our
neighbors in New Jersey just breed
kids and all they do is talk about
what their kids do, or complain
about them. You’re placed in a
financial bind and take a job only
because of the money. We don’t
have the responsibility of another
life on our hands and can do what
we want.”

They discussed making people
more aware of their bodies. Sonja
felt, “There’s a real change in most
young people, partly because of
Eastern studies. Deep inside we
know our culture’s denial of the
body is wrong; subconsciously,
naturally we feel the body is beauti-
ful. We just have to have the con-
fidence to let it out.”

“J have to help others, and my-
self, rediscover feeling for move-
ment that most modern man has
lost, with the advent of technology.
We work with our hands and so
feel any movement is unnatural yet
we all have the urge to dance. It’s
a long struggle to make people at
ease with their bodies. You work
with a group, get them to open up-
they return to their normal sit-
uation and lose ground. It’s not
happening as fast as people would
like to believe,” said James.

One of their lines from their
songs says, “Art is the affirma-

tion of life.’ Clouser said, “It’s an
affirmation, but what you and I
get out of it is different. We try
to comment what we feel about
life. There are various ways of
gaining knowledge, but the more
you can know experience, the rich-
er the whole thing is. We want to
break down the esthetic barrier be-
tween the performer and audience
that exists in the theatre.”

Miss Zarek believes art is the
greatest force for social change.
“The artist first discovers things
that others don’t realize until
later.”

Concerning their participation in
Colloquy, Clouser said, “I’m going
to try to make my teaching more
like it. This is what a college edu-
cation should consist of all along.”

“It’s a Beautiful Day’’ brought

again, that the group revolved
around the unipue sound of Lafuam-

“Tt’s a Beautiful Day” closed the
evening with a fast blues number,
which brought many to their feet
in dance. The performance left no
doubt in anyone’s mind that “‘It’s

music today.

Feeling quite different on the sub-

very different, less popular view
of the “It’s a Beautiful Day” half
of the concert.

Herd Drops Close Contest
To Baldwin-Wallace; 29-21

By JEFF QUINZER

Despite a tremendous second half
effort, the Bisons lost a_heart-
breaker to the Baldwin-Wallace
Yellow Jackets by a 29-21 score.

The Bisons had difficulty in
handling the Yellow Jackets in the
first half and the scoreboard over-

Later, they capitalized on an in-
terception and another fumble to
add another touchdown and a field
goal to their score.

If the first half had been all
Baldwin-Wallace, the momentum
quickly changed to the fired-up
Bisons. After receiving a BW punt,
they drove 57 yards in 12 plays for
a score.

Second string quarterback Howie
Burke completed passes to Jerome
Griffin for gains of 11 and 15 yards
to keep the drive going. Mitchell
Farbstein scored the touchdown,
going oved left tackle from 1 yard
out.

A pass to Griffin was good for a
2 point conversion, With 5:52 re-
maining in the third quarter, Burke
hit Greg Wright for a 15-yard scor-
ing play.

The score now stood at 23-14 and
the Bisons were back in the game.

The Thundering Herd, with mo-
mentum on their side but time
running short, closed the gap to
23-21 with 4:17 remaining in the
game as Burke scored on an 8-yard
run around left end.

Burke had engineered the 89-yard
drive with four complete passes
for 48 yards and was aided by a
pass interference penalty.

On the ensuing kick-off, BW con-
trolled the ball for 3 minutes and
21 seconds before right end Tom

very pleased with the play of the

“The first two losses were frus-

also the fans. I hope that the team
is untracked now. In the future,
the starting lineup is wide open. In
Saturday’s game, Burke was just
learning the system. I expect im-
provement in him and the team as
a whole.”

Howie Burke Sparks
Big Blue Comeback

By ALAN GROCHAL

Substituting for faltering senior
quarterback Greg Doviak, junior
Howard Burke led the varsity foot-
ball team to three second half
touchdowns in their 29-21 loss to
Baldwin Wallace.

Howie had mixed emotions on be-
ing put into last Saturday’s game
in the second quarter.

“I was somewhat leery. We were
being beaten pretty badly,” he said.

Burke was very successful how-
ever, in his first varsity action for
the Thundering Herd. He complet-
ed 17 of 34 passes for 206 yards and
ran for 69 additional yards on roll-
outs.

“Our main problem in the first
half was that we weren’t attacking
the corners. We started to drive
when we ran outside in the third
quarter.”

Howard’s effective running on the
rollout also helped his passing
game.

“The linebackers had to watch
me for the run as well as the pass.
This kept them from moving im-
mediately into a zone.”

Burke credited partisan Bison
fans with helping the team to its
second half surge against Baldwin-
Wallace.

“Tt was gratifying
gave us a standing

that the fans
ovation when
halftime, al-

though we were losing 23-0,” he
said.

Howard is beginning his first year
as a Bison after transferring from
Holy Cross after his sophomore
year.

“Most of the reasons that I trans-
ferred to Bucknell were academic,
but I do think that football is put
into the correct perspective at BU.”

“T like the coaches here and I
feel that the fans are strongly be-
hind the team. Overall, I think
there is a better football program
here than Holy Cross,’’ he added.

Burke did not lose a year of
eligibility by switching schools
since he went to a Junior College
for six months. F

As to his future amount of action,
Howard felt that the time he played
would be dependent upon the type
of teams that the Bisons play and
the success of senior Greg Doviak.

When questioned about his run-
nig as opposed to his passing
ability, Burke modestly replied, “I
really don’t do either well.” Cer-
tainly, Bison fans who saw him
play last Saturday will disagree
with this statement.

Frosh Nip

By DAVE COULTER

Friday afternoon Coach Bill
Lane’s Baby Bisons powered their
way to a 18-0 victory over Lycom-
ing in their season’s opener.

It was what Coach Lane called ‘“‘a
fine team effort,’ with 43 members
of the squad seeing action. The
coach further noted that “each one
was important and did the job.”

Defensively BU’s frosh held the
opposition to 70 yds. total offense.
Coach Lane had nothing but praise
for the job done by the ‘‘whole
front seven and secondary.” The
defensive line of Baker, Carlisle,
Nosal, Blokus and Denne with line-
backers Spirk and ‘“‘Hondo”’ Dailey
held Lycoming to -44 yards rush-
ing.

This devastating unit also alertly
grabbed two fumbles and snared
a stray pass in their debut.

On offense Coach Lane comment-
ed that while the team was some-
times ‘erratic’ it showed. that it
could “move the ball when neces-
sary.”

Led by “‘promising’’ Quarterback
Will Pike, who passed for 16 com-
pletions in spite of a broken finger,
the frosh rolled up 17 first downs
and 260 yards. Bill Stein Pike’s
leading receiver with 6 catches for
67 yards.

Frank Torok pulled in 4 and Joe
Bering 3 key receptions as _the

Bisons scored TD’s in the first,
second and fourth quarters. :

The running power was primarily
supplied by what the coach termed
as two “strong, fast, tough” full-
backs, Paul Perik and Jim Gregor.
Further development of the offense
is expected by the coach as the
season progresses, but he was e€x-
tremely pleased over the “fine

Lycoming

spirit and desire” of his team.
Having started the season on a
winning note, the frosh must now
look ahead to this Friday’s home
contest against Lafayette - a team
they have never beaten. While look-
ing for a “tough game” both coach
and team are “‘full go” and feel
“the time has come to win.”

VOLUME LXXIII — NO. 7

By SUSAN PRESTON
John Zeller,

will mean fewer dollars
year’s operating budget.

Some of the reasons for the defi-
cit include the increased costs of
higher
salaries for administrators, faculty
and physical plant staff, fewer and
gifts, fewer fed-
eral grants, and the additional cost
for campus security during last

operating the University,

smaller alumni

Vice-president of
business and finance, announced in
an interview this week that the
University’s financial deficit for the
academic year 1969-70 is approxi-
mately $300,00. Because the Uni-
versity has had surplus funds in
other years, the financial situation
is still not critical, but this deficit
in this

year’s
scares.

Looking ahead into the future,
Zeller noted that the cost of op-
erating the University Center and
larger scholarships to meet tui-
tion raises will continue to make
the financial picture tight for the
next few years. He projected that
if the spending pattern remains ap-
proximately the same for the next
five years, the University will have
deficits for the next three years
and break even the last two years.

“The best source of income for
the University is tuition,” stated
Zeller. “Consequently tuition will
continue to rise.” Other potential
sources of income include increased
enrollment, larger monetary gifts

strike week and bomb

and endowments, and more federal
government grants.

Speaking about the larger enrol-
Iment possibility, he said that un-
expected increase of 100 students
this year will provide added income
and a possible reduction of this
year’s deficit. The University is
beginning to explore the ramifica-
tions of increasing its enrollment to
2800-3000 students.

“There are problems to be dealt
with if more students are expect-
ed,” said Zeller. ‘How many more
faculty members will we have to
hire? What degree programs have
not reached their limit as to the
number of students they can hand-
le adequately? What about over-
crowded physicel facilities? Will we

Doscher Announces
Disbanding of MCC

By SUSAN HELM

The Men’s Coordinating Council
officially announced its decision
to fold last week, Peter Doscher,
the chairman, stated, “The major
impetus for the decision to dis-
band came from last year’s Coun-
cil, but the actual vote was taken
last week.”

MCC included a_ representative
and alternate from each of the
men’s residence hall councils, from
the Interfraternity Council, and
from the Independent Men’s Or-
ganiation, as well as one member
at large elected by and from the

Youtgoing council. According to
Doscher a lack of interest in last
year’s Council contributed to the
decision to fold.”

MCC’s original purposes were to
coordinate activities of men, to
promote activities beneficial to
the male members of the student
body, to act as a medium through
which male student opinion could
be presented to college authori-

China War (see page 4).

ties and to allocate the funds col-
lected by the University for the
Men’s Coordinating Council.

Doscher evplained that last
year’s Council had definite prob-
lems finding activities appropriate
to the men’s interests which didn’t
involve the entire student body or
conflict with the jurisdiction of the
Associated Bucknell Students.

Doscher stated, “MCC spent the
second semester of last year re-
flecting on their own purposes and
projecting a view of what the sit-
uation would be this year.’ MCC
members decided their function no
longer existed. They found them-
selves discussing the same topics
as the ABS.

MCC realized the absence of tan-
gible programs as only one project
had been successfully completed
during the first semester. This wag
an investigation of the University’s
hair policy for men participating
in athletics. There was an un-
successful attempt to compose a
letter to the parents of students
concerning the moratorium.

More students could also have
an effect on the education pro-
grams offered by the University.
“Hopefully we have enough fat in
the budget that we can cut back
without hitting any muscle,”’ he
Stated, “‘but the University may

It may have to cut back on the
number of courses offered in each
discipline or increase the enroll-
ment in seminar courses. He hopes
that a new governance system will
be devised that give both the fac-
ulty and the students a chance to
help make curriculm decisions.

“The question one must ask,”
he said, “is upon what does the
quality of education depend?”

Concerning the possibility of
larger alumni gifts and endow-
ments, last year the University did
not make its alumni fund budget
by $9000. In the past few years
fewer alumni have been giving
University money and the gifts
have been smaller. Zeller attri-
butes this to the fact that the eco-
nomy is in a state of recession and
possibly that the alumni are some-
what disallusioned with today’s col-
lege students.

Other potential sources of income
for the University are the state
and federal governments. The Uni-

The surveys are questioning how
many private schools are facing
a deficeit, the means they are em-
ploying to combat it, and the effect
it is having on the quality of the
educational programs they offer.

The private schools are prepar-
ing to go to the state legislature
as happened in Connecticut for
money, according to Zeller. He
thinks, however, that the possibil-
ity of procuring funds from this
source is unlikely, mostly because
the state has limited funds to give
to institutions of higher education.

‘Hotline’ Officially Sanctioned
Students Broaden Information Service

By NICKI DREW

The ABS has formally recognied
the Student Information Service as
a University organization, a status
which makes it eligible for financial
help.

During the past year an infor-
mal “hotline” has been taking
shape on campus. Devised and run
by a few students, it was a phone
number which could be called
when someone needed help for
problems dealing with drugs, birth
control, or pregnancy.

But because the ‘‘hotline’ was
not sanctioned by the University
and received no money from it, it
remained an underground project,
unknown to the vast majority of
students.

The Service, which is made up of
a central committee of about seven
students in addition to several
other general members, will deal
with many of the current problems
facing college students in several
ways.

This week, carving by Bill Bennett
is one of the pieces in the exhibit
by the students of William Lasan-
sky on display in the second floor
gallery of the Ellen Clarke Bert-
rand Library.

The core of the Service’s work
will deal with a telephone line that
will be open to all students on
campus and to anyone else who
feels the need for it.

During the day, the phone will be
an information center and will be
manned by someone who will ans-
wer questions regarding the cur-
rent workings of the University,
such as scheduled events, campus
news, current proposals, and in-
formation dealing with administra-
tion and faculty members.

At night, from 8:00 p.m. until
6:00 a.m., the line will become a
“Crisis Intervention Phone” and
will be open to any sort of prob-
lems.

Two students will be available all
night to offer assistance for drug
problems and bad trips, questions
dealing with birth control methods
and problem pregnancies, and for
severe depression due to anything

from illness to male-female
lems. The caller m;

Athletics: An Alternative

Due to the financial crisis at the Uni-
versity, scholarship funds for the 1970-
1971 academic year were cut back. In
spite of this, grants to athletes remain-
ed at their previous level of $216,000
(16 scholarship/class @ $3350). This
constitutes between 16-26% of the year-
ly scholarship aid offered by the Univer-
sity.

Robert Latour, director of athletics,
maintains that the intercollegiate athlet-
ies budget cannot be cut since it is al-
ready at rock bottom. The underlying
assumption here: in order to uphold the
University’s present caliber of intercol-

year. This, however, has been more than
offset by an increase in primary expend-
itures to $248,000/year, more than $100,-
000/year greater than five years ago.
The per centage of cost not recovered by
income is 68%; this per centage of loss
has also increased.

The Bucknellian Editorial Board con-
curs with John Zeller, vice-president of

The Queen

To the Editor

I freely admit to liking Home-
coming weekends. The building of
the floats gives me an annual ex-
cuse to be sc ble with my fellow
workers. The introduction of the
old-time Bison football heroes
(Class of ’21) sends quivers through
my trick knee (from my Class of
67 high school football days).

But most of all, I suppose, I like
gazing at the Homecoming Queen,
voted fairest of the land by one
and all. But, alas, this crown, fair-
est by popular acclaim is but an-
other of my delusions (my first
delusion being that a Northeast jet
crashed over Bucknell; its yellow
tail section falling into the quad.
The Physical Plant set me straight
when I called them to remove it.)

The Queen and her court are not
indicative of any such thing. It

merely indicates who is a member
of the largest sorority. I discover-
ed this while innocently wandering
through Hunt Hall. On a door in
the Delta Zeta suite was a sign
which said “Let’s go DZs, Every-
body vote ten times for u

This shocked my young mind, so
I walked through the other sorority
suites to see if this was standard
procedure, this stuffing of the ballot
box as a part of sisterhood. If it
is standard. no such flagrant evi-
dence as above was to be found
elsewhere. Girls talked to on other
suites said they didn’t know who to
vote for.

I was left in a state somewhat
like the boy who hears for the first
time that there is no Santa Claus
(even though he is 21 years old.)
Then it occurred to me to view it
all another way. Maybe the DZs

FEEDBACK: ‘Miles’

Con...
To the Editor:

I am seldom moved to attack an
individual’s views on an artistic
performance, but the review of Sat-
urday’s concert (especially the re-
view of Miles Davis) pissed me off
enough to write a letter.

Enough  subjectivism—let me
plunge into the matter at hand.
The blame of the failure of Mr.
Davis’s performance lies not with
“the much to  sophisticated..:’’

is, but with the totally un-
audience.

worked cliche) in Davis Gym that
night were terrible. One of the im-
portant vehicles for a good jazz
performance are the vibrations—
the give and take between musician
and musician, between individual
musician and the group, and be-
tween the musician and the audi-
ence.

The artist uses these vibrations
to construct his music

Maybe it was the fact that Davis
Gym is and will always be a gym
complete with its extremely poor
acoustics and its non-concert at
mosphere. Maybe it was the fact
that Miles had the spot normally
reserved for the lowest billed
group. Maybe it was the heat and
humidity. I’m sure that all of these
were contributing factors to the
‘bad vibrations’ present that night.
But, the most important factor
which made the concert what it
was, was the audience.

The group of pseudo-hip, Wood-
stock children was just not ready
for any real music of the caliber
that Mr. Davis is capable of pro-
ducing. I doubt if the majority of
the audience (sepecially the re-
viewer, assuming that he was at
the concert) had ever listened—
and I mean really listened—to any
of Miles Davis’s albums (especial-
ly Bitches Brew).

One can not just fall into his
music as one can to the music
(here I use the term loosely) of
“It’s A Beautiful Day.’’ One must
let Miles work on you by devoting
your self totally to what Miles is
doing. You have to empty your
mind (a seemingly easy task for
some of the members of the audi-
ence) of any and every precon-
ceived notion and let Davis and his
music into your mind as what dom-
inates your being. Once he’s got
you and is putting you through his
changes, you’ll find that it was well
worth the effort on your part. Miles
was trying to reach for something
that night and, to my mind at least,
the audience kept him from reach-
ing it.

I must agree with the reviewer’s
suprisingly astute observation that
the concert lacked something. But
what it lacked could not have been
remedied by a “‘better” (if that is
possibde) musician thanMr. Davis.
What it lacked was audience par-
ticipation. It lacked, on the part of
the audience, any receptivity to

weeny

and respect for Mr. Davis’s music.
This ultimately was the reason why
Mr. Davis did not come off.

Miles must be approached cere-
brally while that other group can
be approached animalistically be-
cause of its rythmic primitivism.
What this concert reaffirmed in my
mind was that Bucknell, for all its
faults, can make a good animal
out of a human being.

For those who first taste of Miles
came on Saturday night, I would
like to make a plea not to give up!

Listen to his records, starting
with the 1947-1948 Charlie Parker
dates on Savoy (although here
Bird’s contribution is more interest-

THE SIDESHOW

The Big Lie

By DAVID WEINBERGER

Agnew is at it again. On the David Frost Show he said that he is
“against allforms of violence.” The Big Lie is at work, and we had better
watch out.

Hitler, of course, was the man most famous for the use of the Big
Lie. Say something loudly enough and with enough conviction, and the
people will believe it.

There is a crummy movie in which a man is caught by his wife with
his mistress. he sits there calmly as his mistress gets dressed and
leaves the house, answering his wife’s shocked. question of “Who is that
girl?” with ‘What girl?”. ‘That girl,” the wife says pointing. “What
girl?,” he answers again innocently. He wins. The Big Lie.

Agnew says he is against all forms of violence. We point to the war.
“What war,” he says from his machine-gun nest. The Big Lie.

Agnew’s big lie, of course, is not quite comparable to the one in the
movie. The wife believes the husband because she trusts him more than
she does her own sense perception. We believe Agnew, if we do, beeause
his Big Lie is our Big Lie. It rolls so easily off the tongue. It has been
said so many times before. We have never doubted it. It is equivalent to
our sense perceptions. If the Big Lie is inconsistent with our actions, we
deny our own actions.

Even if we want to interpert Agnew’s statement so that it is true—
that is, we could say that violence is any offensive action and the USA
is acting defensively in Vietnam—we still have to swallow an even big-
ger lie: take away an evil sounding name and you take away evil. Don’t
call it violence and no one is getting hurt. Call it pacification and we can
accept tarture. We begin to live in a world of words.

Our world is so full of Big Lies that we have to really keep on our
toes. Nixon says that the message of Kent State is that violence breeds
violence, ignoring the reality that it was not the students who were vio-
lent. The Chicago demonstrations were not a police riot. Nixon tells us
to forget what we saw on the set and to believe him instead of our eyes.

If the Big Lies are consistent with each other, if we can fit them into
a meaningful view of the world, then we live in a world of generalities,
of gross sentences, which have no relation to a real world. This is one
form of insanity, to live in one’s own world, to disbelieve that you know
sensibility.

Where do Nixon and Agnew think they are? Do they really believe
that we exist? The Big Lie of the Silent Majority. What clever one the
is, for itslack of substantiality by definition cannot be proved for it is
silent. It i8 just like an invisible playmate. “It’s not there,” you say to
the little kid who believes in it. ‘‘Oh, he’s there all right,” the kid will
reply, “‘but/you can’t see him because he’s invisible.”

The Big Lie of Middle America of the 1900's life-style. Is that where
our “leaders” live? If so, they’ve forgotten that they created that section
of town. To be sure, that neighborhood has bécome somewhat real be-
cause of its fictional existence, Middle America reads about itself in
Time magazine and for the first time says ‘Hey, that must be us!” Jerry
Rubin would say that this makes them Yippies, except the Yippies know
that as Yippies they are fictional. That is what keeps them sane and
Heartland USA insane.

It would be nice to just free ourselves of their Big Lies, but I know,
for example, that me and many of my friends live by our own Big Lie:
We are peaceful. It’s always so much easier to see their big lies than ours,

the federal budget under control,”
Zeller stated

The federal government also has
laws concerning student conduct
and the financial status of the
University. The University has a
tax exempt status under section
701C3 of the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice act because it is a non-pro-
fit organization. Any texpayer who
contributes to the University there-
fore can deduct that sum from
his income tax return.

“We must maintain this tax ex-
empt status if we want to continue
receiving gifts from the alumni,”
Zeller said.

The catch in the IRS law is that
universities may not devote any
substantial portion of their act-
ivites to lobbying or trying to in-
fluence the course of legislation
or participating in the election of
a political candidate. In other
words the school year may not be
shortened for participation in po-
litical activites nor may the Uni-
versity use its assests for this pur-
pose

“We have not yet devised guide-
lines in this area as have Prince-
ton and Williams nor decided or
not to bill people engaged in po-
litical action for the use of Uni-
versity facilites. But we have not
violated this rule as yet. We will
only be in trouble if anyone decides
to sue to take away our status,” he
stated

The University is not yet in the
financial crisis faced by many in-
stutitutions of higher edu ion
across the country although it does
have deficits. Though the methods
outlined above, especially through
continued tuition rises, the Univer
sity will hopefully meet and defeat

By SUE BOLSTRUM

Cap and Dagger will present this
year’s first dramatic production,
Ben Johnson’s The Alchemist, on
Oct. 16, 17, 22, 23, and 24. Dr. Den
nis Baumwoll, professor of English,
is directing this Jacobean comedy.

“The play, written in 1610 by one
of the greatest satirist of the tim-
es” according to Baumwoll, “is a
‘period’ farce. Its language, Cos-
tumes, and technology gives one a
sense of the time separating use
and Ben Jonson, but the theme and
humor of the p makes a modern
audience feel its contemporary
character, its universal flavor.”

All of the action takes place with-
in the house of “The Alchemist,”’
played by Charles Pollock, or on
the street immediately outside the
house. Along with his two accomp-
lices, Face (Snoozy White), and
Doll Common (Sandy Martin), the
Alchemist attempts to dupe sus-
ceptible individuals who some to
him for his services. He claims the
power to change any metal into
gold, and to tell fortunes as well as
other magic powers.

“Clients, upon entering the
hous leave the complexity of
their characters behind, and ex-
hibit all the greed and lust within
them without the cloak of hypoc-
risy usually masking these baser
qualities. ist as the alchemist
strips away the inessentials of
metals and gets to their heart of

Alchemist’

gold so the playwright strips
people of their hypocrisy and poses
their greed and lust under the
masquerade,’’ Baumwoll said

“Besides the complicated inter-
actions between the con men and
their victims, these three import-
ant characters are pitted against
each other,‘ he continued.

The difficulties involved in pro-
ducing the play result mainly from
the complexity of the characters
and the lan ge employed by
them. Though all of the con games
have actually been descrit
documentaries of the times
are easily comparable to some of
the quackery of modern times, a
major challenge to the actors com-
es in convincing the audience that
they believe in alchemy.

Another problem arises with the
changing of roles for each new vic-
tim that enters the world of the
Alchemist. Then too, although the
victims are often seen as one di-
mensional, they must be treated
realistically.

The Jacobean blank verse also
makes it hard for characters to
speak and act naturally while at
the same time retaining the
rhythm.

Because of the nature of the
work there as a tendency to play
for broad slapstick laughs and
sight gags. Director Baumwoll tries
to get the actors to preserve the
style of the speeches without get-
ting static or artificial.

A pregnancy test is in the process
of being set up by the Student In-
formation Service in a clinic inside
a near by doctor's office.

The clinic will be operated two
nights a week by a young register-
ed nurse. For a nominal charge,
she will administer a very simple
test that will determine pregnancy,
and she will talk to each girl about
any physical or emotional problems
she might be experiencing.

The Service is, at present, look-

to house the service all night long
and be equipped to deal with any
emergencies that arise. It is hop-

One difficulty of the Service lies
in determining the training pro-
cedure for those who will work at
the headquarters. The committee
members have been working with
the Williamsport Telephone Hot-
line Service, although they are
making many changes in the pro-
cedure.

The success of the entire project,
according to Sengstack, one of the
leaders of the Service Committee,
“means one telephone call a day,
or just being able to help someone
who hasn’t been helped before.
There is no question that it will
succeed.”

FEEDBACK

(Continued from Page 2)
doubtedly the most exciting record
produced by them is the famous
Kind of Blue album on Columbia
dating from 1959. Miles as ‘a soloist
against the backdrop of first-rate
big-band arrangements is typified
by his cooperation with Gil Evans
on Miles Ahead (Columbia).

Finally, of his more recent work,
I recommend also on Columbia,
Miles Smiles.

These records represent the great
Miles Davis. Don’t write him off
without having heard them. Once
you have heard them you won't be
able to write him off.

By DAVID HAMMER

The following interview reveals
that, while many transfer students
are unhappy about the lack of
specific orientation programs upon
their arrival, at least three are
quite content and find it relatively
easy to adjust to this University’s
atmosphere. A considerable effort
was made to obtain unbiased rep-
resentation for the transfer stu-
dents, yet gripes seemed at a mini-
mum. Pete Stover, a transfer from
last year, Chip DelCoro and Howie
Burke (last Saturday’s football
hero) participated as guests in this
week’s feature interview, discuss-
ing openly their former schools,
adjustment periods and social life,
among other subjects.

eee

BUCKNELLIAN: Which schools
did you attend before transferring
to this University?

STOVER: The University of Rich-
mond.

DELCORO:
South Carolina.

BURKE: Holy Cross.

BUCKNELLIAN: What were the
the circumstances which made you
consider transferring?

S: It (Richmond) was a southern
Baptist, private institution, com-
posed of all middle class Virginian
boys. It was too sterile an atmos-
phere for me.

BUCKNELLIAN: How do you
characterize this University’s at-
mosphere?

S: There’s a real contrast. For
instance, open dorms, drinking —
there’s none of that down at Rich-
mond.

D: It’s completely different here.
You’re free to do anything you
want. I was going to a military
school (Citadel) and the people
were very closed-minded and had
a considerably conservative out-
look. I didn’t go for that.

B: I transferred athletically, for
football reasons, and I thought this
University put football in its proper
perspective. Also, part of the at-
mosphere has to do with faculty,
and I ve four doctors for my
teac here—proft onalism I

BUCKNELLIAN: Isn’t there a
problem in_ transferring distribu-
tional requirements along with the
transfer student? Do you have to
retake any courses here which you
may have already had at your

D: I had a problem. I lost some
credits because some of the courses
I had taken at Citadel weren’t con
side ‘up to par’ here. I'll have
to go to summer school, probably,

Major ‘Gripes’ Seem at a Minimum
Candid Conversations Concern Transfers’ Adjustments

to make up the two courses I’m
lacking. But this school has so
much more of a prestige graduat-
ing than the Citadel would and, for
that reason, I don’t mind the re-
quirement of making the courses
up.

S: Coming here after only one
year at Richmond, I had no prob-
lem regarding requirements. The
only course I did have to retake
was an algebra course which was
below the level given here.

B: There was no pmblem for me.

BUCKNELLIAN: One of the rea-
sons for having you, transfer stu-
dents, interviewed is that the
‘Bucknellian’ has received many
complaints about lack of orienta-
tion programs specifically for trans-
fer students. Do you similarly feel
such a need for this kind of pro-
gram during the adjustment
period?

D: I didn’t have much of a prob-
lem, because most of the people
around here are just really nice
about my transfer situation, will-
ing to help out—

BUCKNELLIAN: Of course, two
of you are living at SAE—

D: That’s a big help. Any time
you did have a question or need
some help, they were there to give
you the answer.

BUCKNELLIAN: Then you don’t
feel you needed an orientation pro-
gram?

D: No, I don’t. But maybe it’s be-
cause I’ve been out on my own for
a couple of years.

B: Being in college for two years,
you sort of know the ropes. Every-
body’ here, in addition, seemed to
want to help out right away. I had
no problem adjusting, either.

BUCKNELLIAN: On another side
of adjustment, how would you
characterize the toughness of
courses here relative to those of
your former schools?

S: Across the board, they’re a
lot tougher here. I find I have to
work a lot more at this University.

D: It’s been quite a bit tougher.

B: I don’t think it’s been so bad.
Here, there’s a greater variety of
courses than I had at Holy Cross
and I’ve been able to select courses
I really want to take. Maybe it’s
not easier—but it is a lot more en-
joyable for that reason.

BUCKNELLIAN: What are your
respective majors?

S: English.

D: Economics.

B: English.

BUCKNELLIAN: And none of you
has any major gripes?

D: No, I’m very happy.

S: Well, in the beginning, it’s
almost expected that it will be
rough getting adjusted. But after
about three weeks, when you get
oriented to the place, I see really
no problem.

BUCKNELLIAN: Do you feel
more lost than you did as fresh-
men in your former schools?

D: Definitely not. You’re used to
it. You’re a college student already,
which certainly aids your adjust-
ment.

B: As far as meeting people, I'd
rather be a freshman because
everybody’s walking around trying
to get to know each other.

S: I agree. These guys (Burke
and DelCoro), living at SAE, have
the benefit of all the transfers liv-
ing together. I was stuck in Swartz
Hall without any students in the
similar situation of just having
transferred. That made it a little
rougher.

B: I can see that problem. If it
hadn’t been for those at SAE, I
would guess that I might not have
met as many people as I have,
just from attending parties and the
like.

BUCKNELLIAN: How have you
changed since coming here after,
in your case, Howie, attending an
all-male college like Holy Cross?

B: Here, your manners sort of
come back to you in this coed at-
mosphere. You get to socialize a
lot better. Even in the classroom,
it’s a good feeling to have girls
around—it helps both intellectually
and visually.

BUCKNELLIAN: What do you
think those transfer students who
have gripes about this school are
talking about, since all three of you
seem contented here?

S: Probably there was just no

special attention paid to them. This
school doesn’t go out of its way in
orienting transfer students. There
wasn’t one program last year
where any of us got together.

BUCKNELLIAN: What specific
programs seem possible and neces-
sary to you?

D: Maybe a dinner reception. A
big brother program might be a
good idea in helping during adjust-
ment.

S: I will say that just the fact
that they have transfer students
living together is a big improve-
ment over last year.

BUCKNELLIAN: Continuing with
a theme of adjustment, how do you
cope with it academically?

D: The graduate students who
tutor in math, for imstance are
really a big help. The teachers also,
generally, are more willing to help
you out here—they’ll fit their of-
fice hours to your schedule.

B: I have a ‘gripe’ regarding
academic adjustment, in that, at
Holy Cross, one could get a B+ or
C— and so on as a final grade.
And that eliminated the rounding
off problem. It helps you a lot.

BUCKNELLIAN: Do either of you
have any questions of Pete, who
has been here a year?

D: How long did it actually take
you to get adjusted, both socially
and educationally?

S: After I started meeting people
and going to frats, I felt part of the
place. You, Howie, with the foot-
ball team, have a good opportunity
for meeting—

B: Yes—I have no gripes about
a big brother program because I,
personally, have those on the team
and at SAE to help me orient my-
self. Socially, meeting girls though,
is a big hang-up here.

BUCKNELLIAN: I thought that,
being transfer students, you could
just walk up to some girl and say
‘Hi, I’m a transfer student and...’

S: Yeah, I tried that—

D: Just try that—it doesn’t work.
‘That’s too bad’ is probably the re-
sponse you'd get.

S: Most girls are on a pedestal
here, and act like it—I guess it’s
due to the ratio of male to female
at this University.

B: Personally, I haven't had too
hard a time, but I don’t know how
long it will last.

BUCKNELLIAN: How difficult is
it transferring to this University?
And what is the procedure which is
followed in applying for a transfer?

B: It is difficult to get in here.
The other two schools I was going
to go to are Duke and Colgate, and
this was the hardest one to transfer
into.

D: It’s like transferring to high
school, procedure-wise. You write
and tell them you'd like to come
here. They send you slips, you have
to get recommendations. Then I
came for an interview, and so on.

BUCKNELLIAN: Is the competi-
tion as ‘heated’ for transfer stu-
dents as it is for potential incoming
frosh?

D: I think it’s harder, because

eo iti LOTS:

they only take a limited number of
transfer students. There. were only
around thirty this year.

B: I don’t think this University
asks for transfer students, either,
so you can see how much harder
it would be to get accepted.

S: And there were even less
transfer students accepted last
year.

BUCKNELLIAN: Do any of you
feel that you could not have been
accepted to this University directly
from high school?

B: I probably wouldn’t have been.

D: Icouldn’t have, either.

BUCKNELLIAN: Why were you
accepted as transfers, then, if the
competition was so much more
‘heated’?

B: I think they saw by the
records, that we could do college
work.

BUCKNELLIAN: Do you have
any closing comments?

S: One point you should make is
that those kids who do gripe about
this University should look into
other places and compare them
with this one—then they'll appreci-
ate it here.

D: I laugh when somebody gripes
about this place. The difference be-
tween here and other colleges is
like the difference between black
and white.

B: My brother’s at Notre Dame,
and he drove down the weekend be-
fore last, and he wanted to transfer
here next year—just after one
weekend.

‘Junior Year Abroad’ Program
Includes Difficulties and Merits

By SHARON DOUTON

After the excitement and adven-
ture of studying and traveling for
a year in Europe, including ad-
justment to numerous cultural dif-
ferences, there is a period of re-
adjustment to the “known” culture
that was quitted for a time.

At least, in the view of four of the
18 University seniors who partici-
pated in the Junior Year Abroad
Program, the task of returning to
the American, and more particular-
ly this University’s educational sys-
tem, has proved more or less dif-
ficult according to individual par-
sonality and experience.

Chris Petersen and Liz Smith,
who were among seven University
students in England last year, and
Debbie Waldren and Art Mielke,
who studied in Scotland (along with
one other Bucknellian) discussed
their experiences. What they had
to say points out the differences
that had to be accommodated on
their return here this fall, as well
as the similarities of the systems.

One: aspect the group in Great
Britain cited was the absence of
a constant pressure of assignments
and, instead, an emphasis on in-
dependent work.

Chris, who studied in the politics
department of the University of
Reading, indicated that she took
the same courses through three
terms (into July).

“T had a list of about 80 books to
choose from, to delve into a certain
period of history, according to what
interested me,’ she explained.
Chris continued, saying that she
wrote papers instead of doing a lot
of ‘‘memory work,” like preparing
for multiple choice tests. She at-
tempted to pursue this trend here
by taking a Continuous Progress
course, and found herself faced
again with multiple choice exams.

Debbie, who was at the Uni-
versity of Edinburgh, also agreed
that the courses allowed more in-
dependent study and echoed the
others’ assertion that they had ac-
tually learned more.”

“Tt is up to you,” Chris added,
“because there is no one to tell
you what to do.”

Art emphasized the freedom ‘‘to
pursue a personal interest’ that
was deemed worthwhile, without
the threat of grades. He spent the
year commuting into Glasgow to
the university.

Liz, however, pointed out that
there was more pressure, at least
in terms of having a single exam
at the end of the-term to deter-
mine success or failure in the
course. Art, agreeing that third

year students and those seeking an
honors degree were under greater
pressure, also noted, however, that
the student at Glasgow was allowed
to retake final exams at least three
times.

Liz commented that there should
be a happy medium between the
“continual assessment” more com-
mon in the United States, and the
“all-or-nothing” system, while she
credited her school (University of
Manchester) with giving the stu-
dent a choice among essays on
exams.

As a footnote, Liz related that
one of her professors expressed
surprise at her ability to take an
essay exam. He had assumed, she
said, that all American university
exams were of the multiple choice
variety.

Several other impressive fea-
tures of the program, which the
four urged present sophomores to
look into seriously, were the tutor
system, the opportunity for travel,
and, in general, the different social
attitudes they encountered. The
group also stressed that they would
be willing to discuss the program
with interested sophomores or with
any group on campus.

Meeting with a tutor once a week,
often on a ene-to-one basis, after
lectures and individual research,
contrasted, in the group’s view,
with the too frequent problem here
of not being able to find a professor
when a question arises.

The tone and purpose of the
year’s education and summer va-
cation following are also different,
the group noted.

Students specialize by the time
they are 16, Chris said, adding,
“they know more, and they’re not
worried” about what to do at grad-
uation. Americans tend to get more
of a “smattering” in many disci-
plines whic allows cross referenc-
ing of courses which is perhaps an
advantage, but which also may lack
the depth the English student
reaches. Chris also noted that few
actually graduate from universit-
ies; most go on to specialized
schools, especially for teachers, or
technical schools.

Money earned through summer
employment is a means of travel,
since the government gives finan-
cial grants to all students. Parents
pay very little of the educational
costs.

In relation to using money earned
for travel, there is a resulting de-
emphasis on possession of material
goods. One senior noted that an
English girl would be overwhelmed
to see a room like some here, com-

On RRR

plete with stereo and a closet jam-
med with clothes and overflowing
with shoeboxes.

Social life, while influenced as
here by proximity of the school to
a city, was characterized as ‘‘more
open,” even if the school popula-
tion was predominately commuters.

Liz said that there was “more of
an effort to meet people, not just
because we were American stu-
dents,” adding that ‘‘we never used
telephones, just walked over to
visit, even if you’ve met a person
only once.’ Chris added that she
also noted a greater willingness to
help others—especially in giving
directions to a newly-arrived for-
eign student.

The “pubs” were social centers
of discussion, and not too much
about politics, especially among
girls. The predominant topic often
wag the level of violence in the
United States, which groups found
to be depicted as something worse
than it is. Still, while abroad, each
found that there was nothing to
fear on the city streets late at
night.

No stigma was attached to a girl
going alone to a pub because it was
the place to meet people. Bring-
your-own parties were organized
often, and if dates were arranged,
the girl usually paid her own way.

The proximity of other cities,
like London, afforded the opportun-
ity to pay regular visits to art mu-
seums, the theatre, and innumer-
able restaurants. The student is
able, as Chris said, to visit “other
than the main tourist attractions,”
in fact, these were mostly avoided.
In addition, there are extended
vacations at Christmas and Easter
(three to five weeks) for traveliing
on the continent.

Perhaps most significant is the
chance to remove oneself from the
culture that has enveloped an in-
dividual for 20 years and to look at
it more objectively.

To notice that American cars
look monstrously large; to notice
that the volume.of American speech
is appreciably higher; to see
America through its own films; to
not understand what “strike week”
meant.

Instead, to enjoy and take pride
in little events, like getting along
without necessary conveniences
like automatic washers; to pick up
delightful new phrases of speech;
to be an independent thinker and
learner; to bear the frustration of
readjusting to the old and more
familiar ways; to look forward to
planning the return trip.

We've often thought what a fan-
tastic turn of events would be (and
imagine the double-takes!) if, after
a football Saturday, the top five
teams in the country would read:
1-Wake Forest, 2-Brown, 3-The Cit-
adel, 4-Northern Illinois, 5-Baylor.
How abolt that! I don’t suppose
it'll ever happen as long as the
football ‘foundries’ continue to
grind out powerhouse teams year
after year. However, Demon Deac-
ons, don’t give up-

And speaking of the foundries,
they’re all fighting for position
again this week. There are a couple
of newcomers in the group. Purdue
and Florida fell by the wayside,
making room for Colorado and - as
expected - Ohio State.

Some changes took place too as
Penn State, Houston, and Missouri
all took large-size nose-dives

Ohio State and Texas are climb-
ing on each other’s backs up at the
very top. Ohio State has a power
quotient of 124.0 . . Texas, 123.6.
They’re both favored to continue
their winning ways this week,
though the Longhorns run into a
little tougher competition.

The top-ranked Buckeyes will
probably decimate Duke by 40
points, while runner-up Texas is
favored by 25 over 20th-ranked
U.C.LA.

The bright new face in 5th place,
the Colorado Buffaloes, will clip
Kansas State by 18 points.

The Big Four in the Midwest,
other than Ohio State, are Michi-
gan, rated 12th . . Notre Dame-3 .
. Nebraska, ranked 9th . . and the
Air Force in 7th. Upsets could be
in the making for possibly two this
week as Nebraska is only seven
points tougher than the Gophers of
Minnesota, and Michigan is rated
15 points over Texas A & M. Notre
Dame will chop up Michigan State
by 38 points, and the Air Force
should blast Colorado State by
about 40 points.

Linksmen Win MAC Sectionals;
Linderman Declared Ineligible

By DAN MILLER

This is a big week as far as the
Bison linksmen are concerned.
Tuesday they handily won the MAC
Western Section fall golf tourna-
ment over Delaware, Gettysburg,
and Rider.

This weekend they travel to Navy
for the ECAC Regional Qualifying
round.

In spite of the grueling 7,052
yard par 72 course, none of the
golfers turned in inflated scores.
Of the five competitors sent by BU,

Junior Co-captain Mark Reddy
shot a 76 which was the low score
for the tournament.

In addition the Bison number two
finisher, Dave Maier pulled a 79
that was good enough for a second
place tie.

The other participants in the
tournament were sophomores Dan
Stetz who notched an 80; Keith
Anderson shot 81, and Greg Mor-
dag who hit the ball 82 times.

In addition, the Herd fielded
three exhibition linksmen, who be-
tween them put on quite a show.

Tex Linderman shot a 78, George
Farrantelli a 79, and Al Shiffler
required 82 strokes to negotiate
the circuit.

Coach Brad Tufts was pleased
with his tema’s performance and
attributed their play to the fact
that they had played “‘more this
fall than ever before.”

This Saturday, October 3, Coach
Tufts will take five golfers to the

The players to go will be Reddy,
Stetz, Maier, Farrantelli, and
either Anderson or Mordas.

The name of Tev Linderman is
conspicuously absent from this list
because he has been declared in-
eligible by the NCAA for intercol-
legiate competition. Tex is a re-
cipient of the Tony Lema Scholar-
ship administered by the Tony
Lima Foundation.

The position of the NCAA is that
the scholarship is not administered
by the University and thus does not
meet NCAA requirements.

Coach Tufts feels that it is “‘un-
fair and a pity that the NCAA
wastes its time on such trivial af-
fairs” and said that the ruling will
be appealed at the January meet-
ing of the NCAA.

Water Polo Club Opens
70 Season Against RPI

By MARK KNODERER

The 1970 edition of the Bucknell
Water Polo Club will be unveiled
this Saturday morning as Rens-
sélaer Polytechnic Institute invades
the Big Blue’s Freas-Rooke nata-
torium

R.P.L’s first team and the Bi-
son’s starting seven will tangle at
10:00 a.m., while the second team
from both squads will meet at
11:15.

R.P.1. is an unknown quantity as
far as ability is concerned. Like
Bucknell, R.P.I. just recently start-
ed the sport. The Bisons did not
play them last year, although they
did participate in the West Point
Invitational last fall, in which the
Bisons finished third.

For the Bisons, the replacement
of stellar goalie Tyler Walthers, of-
fenseman Greg Olson, and defense-
man Jeff Wilkinson is the biggest
task. However, the club has plenty
of firepower remaining.

Foremost among the returnees
is Junior Paul Landes. Landes
scored 66 of the club’s 164 goals
last year, including six crucial
scores in the climatic 8-7 triumph
over Cornell in the West Point
semifinals last year.

Paul Landes, Co-
cpatain of the Bi-
son polomen, is
last year’s lead-
ing scorer. The
water polo club
plays its first
match at 10:00
a.m. tomorrow in
Freas-Rooke pool.

ee)
'
é

The most ferocious player on the
squad is Senior Rob Worthen, who
is taking over Wilkinson’s place as
the “monster man” on defense.
Worthen also scored 16 goals lz
season. Also returning will be start-
ers Dyke Edwards (11 goals), Mike
Huffman (10 goals), and Pete O’Ke-
effe (12 goals). In all, the Bison’s
returnees scored 127 goals last year

Coach Russell cited the teams

“improved passing” and “better
defense’ as the greatest improve-
ments over last year. He termed
overall team speed as the same as
last year, but that is no drawback
when compared with last year’s
explosive arsenal.

For now, however, the Bisons
will play them one at a time, and
hope to improve on last year’s 8-3
record

Pitt Stopped

Bisons Stomp Pittsburgh;
Soccermen Face Rutgers

By BOB WENDEL

Those spectators at Wednesdays
soccer game saw a very good in-
dication of why B.U. won a league
championship last year, and why
they might do it again. In a word,
hustle.

It is not unlikely that given prac-
tice session will start with t two-
mile run, and end with ten 70 yard
sprints. It sounds hard, and it is,
but the rewards are reaped in
every game. was the case in the
4-2 victory against Pitt.

By examining the statistics, the
contest was a very close one. Both
teams had about 15 shots on goal.
Concerning saves, Lloyd Ryysylain-
en had 12, while his counterpart
had nine.

The margin of difference was in
something other than statistics; i.e.,
position. Better field position usual-
ly means the opportunity for a
better shot.

By controlling midfield, and hav-
ing the inside linemen pull back on
defense, B.U. retained posession
and ultimately scored four goals
because of it.

examining who scored

a great deal. All of the scor-

ing was produced by the three in-

side linemen. This is pretty good
indication of game control.

Early in the first period, with
only 4:45 gone, sophomore Bob

Pitt began to come back, and us-
ing ball control reminiscent of
South American style soccer,
scored with 4:30 left in the half

The third period saw the re-
mainder of the scoring. At 4:25,
senior captain Glen Mars scored
his first goal of the year. It came
on a rather unique play. Mars had
the ball deep in the left corner,
and arched the ball toward the net.
The goalie caught the shot, but fell
into the net for the tally.

The final score came on what is
commonly referred to as a “gar-
bage” play. The ball was in the
Bison end, and the ball was being
kicked between many people who
could not gain control of the ball
with little chance for the goalie to
retrive it.

Sventually, the ball slowly rolled

“ross the mouth of the net, and
Pitt lineman Adi Rdissi tipped it in
to score his second goal of the
game.

The most unique thing about the
Pitt team was the very ethnic
quality of the players. Most of the
players names were unpronounc-
able, and the team was very ob-
viously, finely tuned. The aggres-
ive nature of the Bisons however,
prevented the Panthers from get-
ting off the really good shot.

The win was a very important
one for the Bisons, since Pitt was,
in the eyes of Reynolds, close to
the best opponent of the season. His
other pick is Rutgers.

In tomorrows contest, the Herd
meets the Scarlet Knights in what
could be the biggest game of the
year. The game starts at 11:00 a.m.

In last years contest, Rutgers was
ahead by one goal going into the
last quarter, but the Bisons scored
two goals in the final moments of
the game.

game.” “The basic strategy of
pi ng to the open girl was well
executed.”

Also on the bright side is the
fact that there were no injuries,
attributed by the coach to the sup-
erb conditioning of her players.

Coach Peck felt that the game
was “‘a little rougher than it should
have been. There should be zero
body contact in field hockey.”

The other noteworthy fact about
this opening contest was the size
of the crowd. Coach Peck com-
mented that it was “the largest
crowd to attend a BU field hockey
game.”

Junior Winger, Kathy Kellogg
said that it was an encouraging
factor to have a crowd cheering
the team on.” It makes all the dif-
ference in the world.”

The next game for the girls is
Wednesday, October 7 when they
take on Lock Haven State.

Last year’s match was a 7-0 set-
back for the team but this year’s
result feels Coach Peck “‘could well
be a little different.”

Bison Ground Game Key
For Battle of Gettysburg

By JAMES NORTHRIDGE

The Thundering Herd will look for
their first win of the season this
Saturday as they take on Gettys-
burg Bullets. The Bullets, 1-2 on
the season, will prove to be a for-
midable foe but the Thundering
Herd hopes to continue the im-
provement shown in last week’s
game for this Homecoming high-
light.

Players of

Howard Burke of White Planes,
N. Y. and Tony Lucadamo of Haz-
leton have been selected by the
coaching staff as players of the
week for the Baldwin-Wallace
game which the Herd lost, 29-21.

The two Orange and Blue team-
mates were honored by the Lewis-
burg Touchdown Club on Wednes-
day.

Chosen as the offensive player of
the game, Burke entered the con-
test early in the second quarter
with the Bisons down, 23-0. From
his quarterback position the 6-4,
190-pound junior carried the ball
19 times for 69 yards, including
an eight-yard touchdown run. He
completed 17 of 34 passes for 205
yards, and tossed a 15-yard scoring
aerial to halfback Gregory Wright.

Burke also passed to tight end
Jay Griffin for a two-point conver-
sion. The game marked the first
appearance of Burke in a Bucknell
contest after graduating from Nor-
walk (Conn.) Community College.

Prender said, ‘“‘Howie got us go-
ing. He seemed to give us the
necessary spark to move the of-
fense and he sure had us excited
the rest of the way.”

Lucadamo was operating as a
starter at safety for the first time
this season. The 5-9, 165- pound
senior was in on a number of tack-
les and gave excellent coverage on
pass defense.

Dean of Men Reports

Assaults

on Students

By NICKI DREW and PETE BALAKIAN

Several incidents of violence involving University students and
residents of Lewisburg have been reported during the past week by
Dr. Thomas J. Risch, Dean of Men.

The first incident which occurred the weekend of September 26,
involved a series of upperclassmen who, under the influence of
alcohol, verbally intimidated several freshman girls. One girl was
accosted by four upperclassmen and taken forcibly to one of their
rooms where they harrassed her until she escaped.

Although the girl is not pressing charges against the assultants
she did remark shortly after the incident, “I hope something can be
done about the situation. It was a horrible experience and shouldn’t
happen again on a campus like ours.”

Another example of violence took place in Lewisburg last week-
end when three male students were harrassed by local teen-agers.
Several fights broke out after the youths shouted insults concerning
the students’ long hair and clothing. The result was that some of the
students were physically harmed, particularly a freshman, who is
in the hospital with a broken jaw.

Other less dramatic instances of this sort that have been taking
place during the past few weeks include a car which was vandalized

on campus last week-end. In addition,
selling unsolicited

have have been

groups of unauthorized people
goods in the dormitories,

especially in Roberts Hall. The freshman girls have complained
about the ‘‘disturbing” presence of male students upstairs in the

dormitories after 2:00 a.m.

Unfortunately, according to Dean Risch, University officials
are finding it hard to combat the problems because the victims, in
most cases, refuse to cooperate by pressing charges. He feels that
the students are probably afraid to continue their prosecution be-
cause of possible reoccurrences which might endanger them.

Democratic Candidate

Will Speak for Peace

By BILL WHITNEY
The “Students for Peace” will
sponsor Arthur L. Berger to speak
here Wednesday, October 7 at 9
p.m. in Coleman 101-B

Berger, Democratic candidate for
United States Representative from
the nineteenth Pennsylvania dis-
trict, is a Peace and New Priorities
candidate, endorsed by such nation-
wide groups as the Movement for
a New Congress and Referendum
70.

“He will discuss the war in Viet-
nam, environment, education, trans-
portation, and other contemporary
issues,” according to organizer
Dave Logan

October 10 and 17, a contingent
of about 24 BU students will travel
to Berger’s district to leaflet, tele-
phone, and canvass in his cam-
paign.

In related events, workers led by
Marian Payack, for the nationwide
Congressional Action Fund, will so-
licit funds on campus this week for
Peace candidates. Money collected
nationwide will go to ten marginal
Peace campaigns selected by the
contributors from 25 CAF endorsed
candidates, of which Berger is the
only Pennsylvania selection.

Golding has been ranked as the
most conservative member of Penn-
sylvania’s Congressional delega-
tion by the Americans for Consti-
tutional Action, a conservative po-
litical group.

It is hoped by the ‘‘Students for
Peace” organizers that Berger is
among the ten CAF recipients in
order for him to conduct an
eleventh-hour radio campaign.

Schmidt said that the “Students
for Peace’ can be called the “‘first
surfacing of post-Strike political
activity on campus.”

Future activities of the group will
include sponsoring Norval Reece, a
Quaker who lost the Democratic
Senetorial nomination to party-
backed William Sesler in the May
primary, to speak here October 15.

Lindsay Announces
Urban Fellowship

Mayor John V. Lindsay announc-
ed today that New Yory City is
launching the third year of its
Urban Fellowship Program.

With the cooperation of selected
colleges and universities, the City
will conduct a nation-wide competi-
tion to choose twenty exceptional
students as Urban Fellows for full-
time internships in City govern-
ment from September 1971 to June
1972.

Urban Fellows work directly with
heads of New York City govern-
ment agencies and with top
Mayoral assistants. Their assign-
ments involve administrative prob-
lem-solving, research, policy plan-
ning, and related management
areas.

Fellows also take part in weekly
seminars with top City officials
and with local and national leaders
in urban affairs and other relevant
fields of interest.

For the 1971-72 Urban Fellowship
Program the City is greatly widen-
ing ist campus coverage to include
some 400 colleges and universities
accross the nation

For a year’s service in New Yory
City, each Urban Fellow will re-

Three Year Success on Broadway

Susquehanna Series Presents ‘Charlie Brown’

By PAMELA MAY

This Friday night the ‘cynical
wisdom of Lucy, the straight-for-
ward philosophizing of Linus “as
well as the familiar antics of all
the other “Peanuts” characters will
be brought to the stage of Susque-
hanna University as the National
Performing Arts Company presents
“You're a Good Man Charlie
Brown” under the University Artist
Series.

The delightful musical, which has
enjoyed a three year success m
New York City, is the ‘‘comic strip
characters brought to life.”

Through a series of short, well-
constructed scenes the audience will
view the simple, yet strikingly
clear-cut and insightful reflections
of children, the quality responsible
for the continuing popularity of
Charles Schultz’s cartoon.

Spectators will witness Charlie
Brown’s frustration on the baseball
mound, the concentrated toil of
Schroeder as he labors over a book
report on Peter Rabbit, and the ec-
stacies of Snoopy in his exhuber-
ant dance celebrating the ritual of
suppertime.

Show time will be 8 p.m., Fri-
day. Tickets are $2.00 for students
and $3.00 for adults. A sell-out is
expected, so all those wishing tick-
ets are encouraged to call for res-
ervations at 374-1251.

Student Action: Three Contrasting Views

Peace Politics
By JACK SCHMIDT

(The following are excerpts from “The Politics of
Peace” which appeared in the August issue of THE
WASHINGTON MONTHLY. Its author, Sam Brown, left
Harvard Divinity School to organize Students-for-Mc-
Carthy and was coordinator of the Vietnam Moratorium.
He has just returned from a trip to Vietnam.)

“When I visited the North Vietnamese and NLF rep-
resentatives in Paris last February, they made it clear
that they had never counted on the American left to end
the war. Madame Nguyen Thi Binh, the foreign minister
of the Provisional Revolutionary Government (of the NLF),
remarked that she found student radicals very sectarian
and reluctant to touch political power. She continued that
the confused assortment of political objectives on the
left—from legalizing marijuana to overthrowing the gov-
ernment to providing free abortions—dilutes the political
impact of the peace movement... Insofar as unrelated
issues are tied to the peace movement, weakening it,
Vietnamese people and American soldiers die every day
because the peace movement has exported the costs of
America’s social problems to Asia

. . The significance of our acts in the peace move-
ment is politically determined, not privately defined.
Every time a 16-year-old high school student steps off
the curb for a demonstration, there is a political effect.
The war may be nearer or further from its end, according
to the political impact of his action. This places an awe-
some responsibility on those who lead others into action

“The responsibility will be increasingly important as
it becomes clearer that President Nixon is committed to
some kind of non-defeat in Indochina which he calls“‘win-
ning the peace.” There is no evidence in his history that
he could withdraw all troops from Vietnam and stop all
bombing if doing so would be described as a defeat. This
means that building peace politics is not superfluous
American, Cambodian, and Vietnamese bodies are still
being blown apart every day, and only a peace movement
which reaches Richard Nixon’s constitutency can stop it...

“The outline of a successful anti-war strategy, it seems
to me, is clear: The appeal must be made in such a way
that Middle Americans will not ignore the substance of the
argument because of an offensive style. Support for such
an appeal exists. After all, immediate withdrawal is not
a radical proposal in this country today, and careful an-
alysis of the polls shows that all political stances on the
war must be couched in terms of reaching the quickest
possible termination. This indicates that a quick political
settlement or immediate withdrawal can become a major-
ity position if the message is presented in a strong but
palatable fashion.

“While peace activists should not underestimate po-
tential support for an anti-war position, we should also
avoid underestimating President Nixon’s commitment to
some sort of victory in Southeast Asia . . . The President
has read the history books and knows that the great Pres-
idents of the United States won wars. He even knows what

La Pastiche

La Pastiche: Apology to Burt Bacharach
By RICK VANCE

Oh Scott, great, uninhibited Scott. There you walk,
boldly barefoot on Bucknell grass, the quad of last year’s
mass meetings between us, empty, resting, awaiting the
reincarnation of another Cambodia. You move in long,
casual strides, humming to a transistorized tune as you
glide toward the fountain where you will pause for pre-
cisely five minutes and pretend to watch the sunset. Pre-
tension. How convincing is your freaky existentialist fa-
cade: your Jesus beard and long hair teased to wind-
blown-like perfection, your granny glasses and sunlamp
tan, your timeworn bells, your army field jacket and bor-
rowed, unfathomed philsosophies. Yoyr jacket swings
open and closed as you walk, alternately whispering and
stifling your t-shirted claim to collegiate status and know-
ledge whose presupposition is not wisdom. (Irony: the
targets of your verbal spewings, the hardhats, are no less
wise and far nobler than yourself, for they are sincere;
you are not). Ah, but how completely you gave of yourself.
How loudly you supported the cancelling of classes. How
extensively you enjoyed the extra Bison breaks and bull-
shit sessions that precious time afforded

You wear a chain. It is a large exclamation point
which rims your fashionably thin neck. Its dot is a peace
sign that dangles close to your unfashionably empty heart.
P-e-a-c-e or p-i-e-c-e? Your pagan sex shouts your reveren-
cy: worshipping sex for the sake of sex alone. Your
marijuana rationale, your obscuring Bible, defies love.
Drugs make love irrelevant, don’t they? Bad becomes
better; primitive carbon suddenly, miracuously seems like
diamond, and wrong becomes . . . well, who of us can say
what is right and what is wrong, (‘Conceived in con-
cupiscence we die unrepentant.’’-Updike).

Oh, Scott, poor, misguided Scott. You see several
others by the fountain; your pace quickens, and a prac-
ticed, toothpaste smile flashes onto your lips. It will
vanish when you are alone, when your performance is
without audience, but now it is there, mocking you, dis-
torting you . you, a professed constituent of the “Jet
it all hang out”’ set . you, a self-proclaimed member of
the “love generation’. . . to whom love is irrelevant???

The look of love is not yet the look of the ‘“‘love gen-
eration,” because most of us are merely imitators, and
that which we have chosen to imitate is not love.

day, October 9, New Dorm Pit meetings are

Plugged Channels

To the Editor:

As I mentioned last evening, at the great risk of being
immediately labelled a typical reactionary administrator,
I would like to propose that the Bucknellian publish Dr.
Toole’s letter. Though basically liberal, I do adhere to the
somewhat hackneyed aphorism that “action speaks louder
than words.” He strips away the bull, acknowledges our
areas of greatest need and suggests that this volatile body
of 42 million, “‘get on with it”. . . and my observation is
that they will be startled at the large number of other en-
lightened people who will join forces.

Jack E. Brothers
Director of Alumni Relations
Dear Waiting Student:

If you haven’t discovered it yet, now is the time.
Upon what meat does the violent rockthrowing, building-
burning campus militant feed? On yours, Sir, your very
own flesh. You, the standers-by; the doubters concerning
the question of whether the American system can work.

It is very late and there are some things you should
know — and you should know whether you like them or
not.

You are standing by basically because you say you are
frustated; the channels are plugged; you cannot make
your voices heard. You are idealistic and you love your
country, but maybe the violent ones are right. Maybe you
will join because the only course left to you, you say, may
be violence.

It so happens that you are wrong, dead wrong.

Across America there is growing wrath about college
violence. Not anger; wrath. Call it middle America, call it
“those people out there,” call it the ‘‘silent majority’—
call it what you will, but every act of violence by the left
on any campus in America feeds the fires of the right.
And the power’s there on the right; the power that will
force legislatures and Boards of Regents to devise iron-
clad rules of conduct for students and faculty; a suppres-
sion which will put the 1920’s to shame. It will destroy
academic freedom and it will destroy your own oppor-
tunity to get an education.

I am sick to death of your drumbeat, overblown rhe-
taric, the monotonus litany, “We cannot make our voices
heard. No one will listen to us.”’ The violent left is heard.
But you are correct in thinking that very few people listen.
That is because the violent ones have nothing to say.

So the channels are plugged? You have no way to go?
The wires are cut? You are powerless? Here again, the
bull horn rhetoric.

The channels to change in America are not plugged.
You simply do not know how to use them. I, for one, am
sick of the fact that you haven’t done your homework or
tried very hard.

Just as a simple example: There are 31,000,000 voters
in America under thirty. As former Chief Justice Warren
put it, “Youth can lead a crusade anytime it wants to.”
If the 18-yeor-old vote stands the test of constitutionality. |

Due to t ck of accuracy and
the abundance of unfounded opini-

Becker’s column ‘Here We Go

a fuller picture of the situation

In reference to American motives

of military action in Jordan, Mr
Becker states that “the first thing
that comes to mind is U.S. business

opposition to the formation of a
Marxist Arab state, inherently ben-

mation

The state of Jordan was set up
after WWI due to a quirk of history.
It is a chunk of land arbitrarily
chosen in reference to natural bor-
ders. It is almost totally devoid of
natural resources, dependent to a
great deal upon financial aid from
other countries for its viability,
thus a poor target for ‘American
imperial exploitation’.

The inherent benevolence of a
Marxist state set up for Palestini-
ang frankly escapes me. First of
all, a small percentage of the ter-
rorist forces are Marxist in ideal-
ogy, while the total number of ter-
rorists make up a small % of the
Palestinian population. The Arab
people, by tradition (Islam) are
not Marxist and, if anything, are
opposed to its ideology. Further-
more, neither the ability nor the
desire of the terrorist command to
take over the government of Jordan
has been shown.

To me, American interest in the
Hussein monarchy is obvious. The
Arab bloc in the Middle East makes
up an important portion of the
word] population, size and influence.
The U.S. has no diplomatic rela-
tions with Egypt, Syria and Iraq.
Lebanon cannot truly be consider-
ed an Arab state. Thus, Jordan is
the U.S.’s only tie with this im-
portant bloc. Should the Palestini-
ans gain control of Jordan, the U.S.
would have no diplomatic ties with
the Arab Middle East. Nasser, him-
self, supported Hussein, in part, to
keep an open channel between him-
self and Washington.

Blatant statements of Israeli
policy toward the Palestinian refu-
gees’ policy toward Israel put forth
in the column. only go further to in-
dicate how misinformed Mr. Beck-
er is.

QUESTION: I have just had a baby. It is two weeks old and I am breast-
feeding her. If I were to return to taking mescaline or amphetamines,
would my milk be harmful to my baby in any way?

ANSWER: A variety of drugs do appear in mother’s milk. Usually they
are not there in a very high concentration. Accurate data is difficult to
come by on the subject of amphetamine and mescaline excretion in milk.
But there is little reason to doubt that some drug gets through. The sit-
uation is complicated by the fact that “‘street’” drugs vary tremendously
in content and some contain fairly potent poisons, which may enter the
milk in large amounts.

An important consideration should be the potential difficulty that
could arise for your helpless infant if you were to be out of commission
on a bad trip. In addition, amphetamines markedly decrease one’s ap
petite, and the nursing mother needs a fair amount of food above her own
requirements to keep the milk factory running. It is very important that
the mother have an adequate amount of milk, fruit, vegetables and pro-
tein in the form of meat, poultry or fish, Nursing mothers are also given
vitamins.

Breast-feeding has been gaining in popularity again in recent years.
It has tremendous practical advantages as you always carry the food
supply with you and there is no fussing with bottles, etc. It is economical
and many women find it very gratifying. My own careful observation of
babies at the breast makes me think that they have a good thing going
for them and they know it. La Leche League is an association of volunteer
breast-feeding mothers. Check your local telephone directory.

QUESTION: I live off campus and have a limited amount of refrigerator
space. Which of the following types of things would be safe to keep out of
the refrigerator without spoiling (as long as months): catsup, peanut
butter, barbeque sauce, jelly, pickles, relish, mustard, pickled beets?. -

ANSWER: My, but you have a limited diet. Many food containers are
marked indicating whether they need to be refrigerated after opening.
Pickles, relish and pickled beets probably should be refrigerated after
opening. Some mustards should be as well, but this is easily beaten by
using dry mustard and mixing as much as you want each time. The other
items on your list that do not require refrigeration include dried fruits,
halvah and certain types of salami. You can also save refrigerator space
by using dry milk and mixing a serving at a time; it’s also very cheap.
Processed cheeses (ask your local grocer) also do not require refrigera-
tion.

Most things made from milk, cream and eggs, such as mayonnaise,
custards and cream pies as well as potato salads, etc., must be refriger-
ated at all times. Many people get serious food poisoning from these
products which are easily contaminated by dangerous bacteria in warm

University Co-operates
In Electricity Reduction

By NANCY GRDEN

The University co-operated last
week with Pennsylvania Power and
Light and Citizens Electric Com-
pany in Lewisburg by reducing
their electrical power load in or-
der to prevent a blow-out due to
the unseasonable hot weather.

ment for it to be effective. He also
felt that if a two-thirds majority
is not reached, the committee can
try again, and that if the document
were passed by a less than this
majority, it would cause a breach
of faith with some faculty members.

Becker’s motion was defeated 70
to 34.

Other business at Monday’s fac-
ulty meeting included the addition
of one more class day to next
year’s academic calendar by short-
ening freshman orientation week.

Dr. F. David Martin, professor
of philosophy, was nominated to
serve on the committee on schedul-
ing for one year.

The ABS will vote upon the ap-
pointment of Mr Alan I. Leshner,
assistant professor of psychology,
and Owen Mahon, asssitant profes-
sor of accounting to the Board of
Review of Academic Responsibility.
Dr. Edward Cotter, assistant pro-
fessor of geology, was nominated
to serve on the student affairs com-
mittee.

Dr. Douglass Candland, professor
of psychology, motioned that the
faculty elect a parlimentarian and
vice-parlimentarian to answer pro-
cedural questions that arise during
meetings. His motion was tabled
until the November faculty meet-
ing.

“The accomplishments of the Fel-

Vaughan Lit Library

Mr. Walter Geiger, head of the
physical plant, reported that the
University reduced the amount of
electricity used in various campus
buildings, as well as the air-condi-
tioning load in these buildings.
They also cut off the lighting of
the library and chapel at night,
and the band practice in the foot-
ball stadium with only half the
usual amount of lighting.

Geiger also said that the Uni
versity has an electric generator,
and they offered its use to local
utilities should it be needed.

Pennsylvania Power and Light,
which feeds Citizens Electric Com-
pany and the University, reduced
its voltage situation up to 5 per
cent of the usual amount of volt-
age last week in order to prevent
any brown-outs or black-outs such
as those experienced in the rest
of the northeastern section of the
United States, from New England
through North Carolina.

Prices Reduced
On Play Tickets

University Students attending Cap
and Dagger productions this year
will discover reduced ticket prices
for many performances.

For example the stulent theatre-
goer will find lower prices in effect
for three of the five productions of
“The Alchemist.”

This service has been made pos-
sible by a subsidy granted by the
ABS.

Upon presentation of a University
ID, a student will receive a one
dollar discount on either the $1.75
or $2.00 ticket for any student dis-
count performance.

One discount ticket may be pur-
chased for each ID presented, with
a maximum of two discounts per
person.

Tickets for all productions are on
sale in advance at the Bookstore
and at the door.

“The Alchemist,” C&D’s first
production, will be presented Octo-
ber 16, 17, 22, 23, and 24, October
16, 17, and 22 have been designated
as student discount nights.

Military Plans

A meeting to discuss action to be
taken against military recruitment
on campus will be held on Tuesday,
October 6, at 7:00 p.m. in Coleman
101B.

Exams

The Graduate Record Examina-
tions, including the Advanced Tests
in major areas, will be offered at
the University on October 24 (the
registration forms must be in
Princeton by October 6). The tests
will also be offered December 12,
January 16, April 24, and February
27 (at Penn State, Pittsburgh, and

but instead permitted our leaders
to involve us by stealth. This cri-
tical failure gave inertia to the pro-
pagation of the Vietnam war and
sneaked the flag onto the battle-
field—leaving the peace movement
at an enormous political disadvan-
tage. The system has provided poor
information to voters and little
active leadership for a position of
obvious principle

“If the war is now ended by po-
litical action, as I believe it can
be, some will undoubtedly argue
that the system has vindicated it-
self. That argument, however, is
self-deceiving; for in many crucial
respects our system already
failed and requires radical recon-
struction.

tion. If the war can be ended only
with such self-delusion, we should
end the war now and fight the de-
lusion later.”

The contest was barely a minute

They continued to apply the pres-

and consistently beating Rutgers to
the ball. As a result, Bucknell con-

led the play at midfield and set
everal good shots.

With 5:05 gone in the second
period, Joe Steinmetz lofted an ac-
curate pass to Glen Mars, behind
the Rutgers fullback, and Mars put
the ball in the upper-right corner of
the net for a 2-0 lead.

In front of a large Homecoming

showed, for the second consecutive

Trailing 6-0 throughout most of
the game, the Bisons rallied for
their first score after a blocked
punt by tackle Gene Depew, mid-
way through the last quarter.
Quarterback Howie Burke capped

the game out of reach.

Naturally, after such a tough loss
there is little for a coach to say,
but Coach Lane did have some ob-

vations to make. As he put it,
“Lafayette has a fine football squad
this year. We could tell by the
game films that they were well
drilled. Our boys stayed right in
there and didn’t give up. If we
could have scored that one touch-
down, I think it would have chang-
ed the whole complexion of the
game. We could have tied the score
and with the extra point gone
ahead. But instead we lost the ball
and the momentum. We had a good
passing game and outgained them
in passing yardage 2-1, but we just
couldn’t stop their running game
It was just a tough game.”

back Barry Jacoby fumbled on the
first play after the kickoff. C. B.
Mansfield’s recovery gave the
Bisons the football on the Gettys-
burg 33.

Running back Rick Diez sprinted
around left end for 23 yards, and
two plays later scored on a 7 yard
burst over the left side. The con-
version made the score 14-6 with
only 4% minutes remaining.

Gettysburg made a spirited ef-
fort to score however, and moved
the ball down to the Bison 16 before
losing it on downs. The Bullets re-
gained the football once more deep
in Bison territory, but time ran out
before they could mount a threat.

In the early stages of the game,
the hundering Herd showed almost
familiar inability to score from
in close. Early in the second quar-
ter, they drove from their own 33
to inside the Gettysburg 10, only
to be stalled on the 1.

A fumble by Howie Burke on
third down from the one was the
key setback in the scoring op-
portunity.

Throughout the first 3 periods,
that drive was the Bisons’ most
serious scoring threat although a
long touchdown run on an inter-
ception by Jim Cassidy was nul-
lified by an offside penalty.

The only other Bison offensive
highlight before the fourth period
scores was a 37 yard run on a
keeper by Howie Burke. Burke’s
run brought the ball to the Gettys-
burg 24, but the Herd failed to
capatilize.

Overall, the Bisons exhibited an
impressive running game both out-
side and up the middle. They amas
sed 200 rushing as compared
to only 71 for Gettysburg.

Three-Fold Purpose

AWS Changes Structure, a
Emphasizes New Function Pregnancy Clinic Opens;
Doctor Offers Services

By LYNDA ROSCOE

In a statement issued to The
Bucknellian this week Ann (Stuie)
Oliver, President of the Associated
Women students has redefined the
role of AWS in the University com-
munity.

The statement emphasizes the de-
cision of the Senate to change from
a governing body to one of schedul-
ing events aimed at the female pop-
ulation on Campus.

In the past the AWS has been
the sole governing body for women
students, but with the advent of the
no-hours policy and the adoption of
a new judicial procedure for the
University’s student body, the duties
were taken over by other univers-
ity structures.

The text of the statement fol-
lows;

“The members of AWS Senate
have in the past year felt the need
to re-examine the present structure
and role of the Associated Women
Students organization, in the ex-
tensive co-ed orientation now
emerging.

“With such a co-ed emphasis,
however, it is thought that a need
for a body to encourage women’s
interest in different areas, thereby
enriching their college experiences,
still exists. Creating a new-means
of effectively serving these in-
terests now faces the present Sen-
ate.

“A shift in emphasis from gov-
erning to programming is seen in

Dr. George Minard
Dies of Hemorrhage

Dr. George W. Minard, 55, pro-
fessor of chemical engineering at
the University, died Wednesday
evening in the Evangelical Com-
munity Hospital, Lewisburg, after
becoming ill while conducting an
oral examination at the University.
Death was attributed to a cerebral
hemorrage.

A native of Chicago, Professor
Minard received a bachelor of sci-
ence in chemical engineering de-
gree from the Armour Institute in
Chicago and master of science and
Ph.D. degrees in chemical engine-
ering from Ohio State University.

Prior to joining the faculty as an
associate professor in 1951 he
served as an assistant professor at
the University of Utah in 1943-44
and 1945-47 and as an assistant pro-
fessor at the University of Toronto
from 1947 to 1951.

Author of several scholarly
papers, he was a member of Sigma
Xi, national scientific society; the
American Institute of Chemical En-
gineers,

He is survived by his wife, the
former Hertha Arned, two sons,

the new role of AWS. It will, there-
fore, be necessary to discover the
needs and interests of the women
students which a co-ed government
may not be prompted to meet, and
program accordingly. Any overlap-
ing of programming effort with
other campus organizations will be
avoided and, at no time will AWS
become a committee of ABS.

“The AWS Constitution commit-
tee has recently initiated efforts
to write a new constitution. The
future role of the AWS will require
a different platform of elected of-
ficial positions. The nature of such
a platform, the means of election,
elgibility requirements, and respon-
sibilities of its members are all
questions which the new constitu-
tion will seek to resolve. The doc-
ument, if passed when presented
to the women students, will go into
effect next year.”

By PAMELA MAY

A clinic will be open to uni-
versity students to handle problems
of birth control and pregnancy, be-
ginning October 13.

Its purpose will be three-fold:
1.) to administer pregnancy tests,
2.) to provide counselling to girls
for handling pregnancy and 3.) to
help girls who have missed a
period but are not pregenant.

The clinic, located at 22 South
5th Street, will be open every Tues-
day and Thursday night from nine
to eleven. It has been set up under
the supervision of an accredited
physician, Dr. Jack L. Fairweather.

A registered nurse will always be
on duty.

All pregnancy tests will be given
free of charge, although a two dol-
lar contribution is asked to defray

the cose of the test kits.

The test itself is extremely sim-
ple and quite valid: it is reliable
one month after conception, usu-
ally two weeks after the scheduled
time of the menstrual period.

Girls are advised to take the test
as early as possible if in doubt.

Only a urine sample is required.

Abortion counselling will also be
available to those who desire it.

Gidls will find advice on all al-
ternatives to handling a pregnancy,
ie. keeping the child, putting it up
for adoption, or obtaining an abor-
tion.

Girls who have missed a period
and are not pregnant will be refer-
red to another doctor for consulta-
tion

None of the counsellors or nurses
will be paid.

Sponsors School Construction

Raffle Supports Partnership Program

By JUNE CAFFREY

A “unique’”’ program of foreign
aid is being sponsored by the
junior class. The project, planned
in cooperation with the Peace
Corps, is called the School Part-
nership Program. It is designed to
support school construction in de-
veloping countries in Africa, Latin
America, the Near East and Asia.

The Partnership works on a
school-to-school basis whereby a
school in the United States raises
$1,000 to found a school in an
emerging country.

The money covers the cost of
building materials; however, all
construction is done by the people
in the village. The project empha-
sizes the idea of self-help, a con-
cept basic to Peace Corps organi-
zation.

In order to raise money for this
University, a student raffle will be
held. Tickets may be purchased in

all dining halls and the library
(from 10-1 p.m., Monday thru Fri-
day, Oct. 22-30) for 50 cents apiece
and five for $2.00. Prizes include
a $50 gift certificate, a copymate
(donated by the Bookstore), and a
meal for two at the Lewisburg Inn.
University organizations will be
asked to contribute to the cause.

Tom Scurrah, chairman of the
project, explained that a model of
the “new” school will be construct-
ed in the Bertrand Library, as a
means of emphasizing that “buy-
ing a raffle ticket is the same as
buying a brick.”

The school in the village will be
a means of cultural exchange; the
village people will report on the
progress of its construction.

Scurrah further stated, ‘The
school will become the center
around which community life will
revolve.”

Winners of the raffle will be an-

nounced Friday night, October 30,
at a coffee house sponsored by the
junior class in Swartz Lounge. Any
extra money recognized through
this project will be donated to the
World University Service, a non-
governmental organization with the
same aims as the School Partner-
ship Program.

The anonymity one expects in a
doctor’s office will also be main-
tained at the clinic. Parents will
not be contacted; age makes no
difference, according to organizer
Jeff Sengstack.

The opening of the clinic is furth-
er evidence of the visible progress
of the Student Information Service
Committee.

Spokesman Sengstack noted, ‘In
the beginning, doctors were willing
to help, but unwilling to commit
themselves because they thought
nothing would happen.” Yet the
service has already proved its use-
fulness in aiding several students
according to Sengstack. Sengstack
adds, “Dr. Fairweather is an ex-
tremely busy phisician and cannot
take too many more patients. How-
ever, he is talking to other doctors
in the area for further help.”

The information office now has a
physical location in the back room
of the Bison, adjacent to theL’Agen-
da office

It will have a listed telephone
number, not yet determined, to be
used during the day for advice
and personal references concerning
birth control, problem pregnancies
and venereal dise

It will also serve as a general
information center providing all the
news students may desire concern-
in what’s happening on-or-off-cam-
pus, and drug information—includ-

Intercollegiate Tournament Ahead

Debaters Reorganize After Year of Inactivity

By LINDA CAPUTO

The Intercollegiate Debating So-
ciety has undergone a period of re-
organization and has resumed its
former position as a University
supported activity.

This Society, which remained in-
active last year, has been re-estab-
lished as an extracurricular acti-
vity as a result of student interest.

The objective of this program is
to provide the opportunity of in-

Clarification

A great deal of reaction has resulted from an article which ap-
peared in the last issue of The Bucknellian (Tuesday, Oct. 6) con-
cerning several incidents of violence or near-violence on and around
the University campus. The Bucknellian staff feels it necessary to
make a few corrections in the article and to clear up some of the
misunderstanding which seems to have resulted from it.

Because of the wording of the article, the impression was given
that Thomas J. Risch Dean of Men was responsible for all of the
information related in the story. Although much of it is taken from
an interview with him, some details were obtained from other
sources. In addition, there appears to have been a misunderstand-
ing between the reporters and the Dean concerning the complete-
ness and finality of the information, and therefore, the appropriate-

ness of publication at the time.

The article seems also to imply that it is impossible to take any
action against these types of offenses or against offenders involved.
This is not true. There are difficulties involved sometimes due to
the injured individual’s understnadable hesitancy to formally pursue
a matter for various reasons. But there are actions the University

can take.

terested students to become in-
volved in competitive events out-
side of athletics.

Membership in this newly struc-
tured coed organization is open to
any interested student. Past debate
experience is not required for ac-
tive participation

This year’s debate topic deals
with the following issue: whether
the Federal government should or
should not adopt a program of com-
pulsive wage and price controls.

In addition to this selected issue,
other intercollegiate debates will
be scheduled on various topics of
general interest. In addition to ac-
tual intercollegiate debating, indi-
vidual speech events, such as ora-
tory, individual and extemporan-
eous speeches, will be scheduled.

Another aspect of the Society, its
organization, allows students to act
as research assistants, publicity
members, and clerical aides.

Therefore, this program is gear-
ed to issues beyond the scope of
the selected topic and operates on
several levels, intercollegiate and
collegiate.

According to Steve Valenti, act-
ing student director, “by partici-
pating in this organization, one can
extend his knowledge in various
areas, one can strengthen his

ability to think logically in develop-
ing an argument, and one can de-
velop ease and self-confidence in
public speaking.”

The Society will hold weekly
meetings on Tuesday evening at
7:00 p.m. in Vaughan Lit. Rm, 203.

Professor Frank W. Merritt and
Mrs. Mary J. Spaid are faculty
sponsors. Professor Merritt has
served as the advisor for the De-
bating Society for more than twenty
years.

Students Planning
Peaceful Protest

By JENNY CHEN

A peaceful protest movement
against military recruitment is
planned for next Wednesday when
an U.S. Army official will be on
campus.

The group which is raising ob-
jections will locate themselves out-
side of Carnegie Building with
signs and buttons hoping to thwart
some response to the recruitment
program.

At an organizational meeting
earlier this week, sophomore
Gradie Frederick said, “We will

the theatre and, among other
topics, his own experience in the
theatrical medium, both as an actor
and director. And it is with this
subject that the interview opens.

< * &

BUCKNELLIAN: I have seen you
perform at least once as an actor.
How many times have you per
formed on this University’s stage
and, if it came between acting and
directing, which would you prefer?

POWERS: I acted last year in
The Rimers of Eldritch, and the
last time I acted prior to that was
in Krapp’s Last Tape in 1961.

if I had to choose between the
two, I suppose I would choose di-
recting because I recognize my
limitations as an actor. While I
enjoy acting very much, I feel I
can make more of a contribution
to the work in the theatre through
directing.

B: Have you ever directed your-
self in a production?

P: Yes, in Krapp’s Last Tape.
That was one man and a tape re-
corder—

B: It must be difficult obtaining
an objective viewpoint as an actor-
director. How did you go about di-
recting yourself in that play?

P: Not very successfully. Serious-
ly, I think if I were to do anything
of that sort now, I would have re-
hearsals videotaped, and then
watch them. At the time of Last
Tape, I simply had to rely upon the
judgment of a few close friends—
students and faculty colleagues who
would come in, watch, criticize and
make suggestions.

B: Did you feel at any time that
you were objective enough to over-
rule any of their criticisms?

P: Their criticisms weren't
really of the nature that I would
need to override them. They could
see what I was trying to do; what
they were trying to do was to judge

FEEDBACK: Vance

By HEDDY MATTHIAS

Well, I guess the time has come
to tell of my summer experiences,
for they seem to take on more
meaning with each passing edition
of The Bucknellian and its attending
inculeations of, ‘Come on, you
peace faggots of the Cambodian
vintage. Get off your asses and do
something.” The arguments range
from doing nothing (or the inability
to do anything) to explicit direc-
tions for working on the November
campagins. The arguments are old,
and yet we seem to be inevitably
caught between optimism and pes-
simism.

The June escapade was in itself
a manifesto to me. I had been torn
to inaction because of the enigmas.
I could not say to my elders that
I had tried and failed, or even if
the ability to answer this question
one way or another wasa valid re-
flection upon the problem.

D. C.

Nevertheless, I packed my bags,
left the lucrative offerings of my
summer job far behind, and tramp-
led into Washington, D.C. But I
took with me a special framework:
I was trying to ascertain not if the
“system” would work, but if look-
ing upon the solution of the prob-
lem in this yes-or-no manner was
even the correct perspective.

I bedded myself down into a two-
room apartment with three other
girls and proceeded to study just
what the Washington Summer Cru-
sade was about, and what the
Washington Peace People were
about.

Upon arriving, I immediately
nestled myself into a nice, cozy,
legitimate - looking organization
ealled “Project Pursestrings.” The
“new” citizens’ lobby was com-
posed of late-twenty-yr. old law
and graduate school workers: Sam
Brown; Greorgy B. Craig (my boss
confidante) of the famed Agnew-
Frost Show; Jim Johnson, the
super-boy of Princeton fame; Mar-
tha McCahill of the Lindsey-type
Ripon Society (liberal Republi-
cans); Tony Podesta (Rev. Duffy’s
campaign manager in the Conn
Senate race); and a staff of about
fifty able well-established bodies of

Ivy League vintage and class.. Op-

erating expenses alone came to

about $20,000 for the first month.
What we did

You might now be wondering just
exactly what we did. I wish that I
could adequately tell you. When
people asked us this question we
answered, “We ar g on The
Amendment to End the War.”

I’m not sure exactly what we were
doing or did do

Greg spent his whole summer
raising money (vast amounts to
me) in order to run the lobbying
campaign. His travels took him
across the country, and into many
strange beds. Most of all, he de-
tested his job in the organization,
and constantly felt like a PR man,
which he was.

He raised around $50,000, a dirty
$50,000, I think. I can’t divulge the
exact sources, but many dollars
came from officials and diplomats
that got us into the vortx of the
cold war to begin with. Dirty
money, reparations and offerings
to the gods for forgiveness.
Their money they donated, rather
than their public word, a word
which would have carried far more
weight. But no, they remained si-
lent in their guilt, and slipped the
penance under the table. Enough
of this.

The operation was a long way
from an ad-hoe crusade. These Ivy
Leagers have been in the game a
long time; connections with the
lower “‘powers-that-be”’ are“old and
well-established. We worked with
the offices of the peace Senators,
organizing ad campaigns in swing
states, etc., applying silent and
overt pressure on men of “power.”
We had strategic meetings every
day to keep caught up on the hap-
penings on the Hill, briefings from
legislative assistants, and planning
sessions.

The organization began slowly
(or perhaps by its own birth) to
resemble its adversary. There
were ruling cliques, power plays,
coups d’etat, snobbery, and elitism.
The growth was almost impercept-
able, and yet evident. We began
the old ‘‘means-justify-the-ends”
game. I talked to many of the

workers regarding the evolution of
means employed. Perhaps I was
right when I hinted that these
structures of ruling came part-in-
parcel with the founders. ‘Yes for
some, no for others; but a seem-
ingly overwhelming majority of
yeses.
Our Leaders

I’m afraid that I have little good
to say for our great peace Sena-
tors & Represenatives themselves.
I met many personally during the
summer. Of these, I can note only
two that struck a common chord
with me. Allard K. Lowenstein,
from Long Island, seems honest,
idealistic, and absolutely mad.
Senator Eugene McCarthy provides
a living example, to me, of what
it’s all about, for he shall resign
this fall to write and read books
about Camus and other related sub-
jects.

I believe that Senator George
McGovern (feed-the-babes McGov-
ern) is an absolute prick. The con-
firmation came with his name on
the top of the list requesting Nixon
to waste no time in sending arms
to Israel. He seems to be running
his hopes for the 1972 election on
his Vietnam followers. The war is
not an end in itself, but a means
to a career. They are all frauds,
and they come in toto with one’s
first acceptance of the ‘‘system.”

I guess it comes down to the
plain, horrible truth of the dis-
tribution of power; either “for”
you or “against” you. Washington
equals power. Political careers as-
certain that power by scrambling
and squeaking and scratching. It’s
not inherent in the men themselves,
but in the relationships that they
must have with each other.

So I guess if one is willing to
have one’s relationship with other
men defined by power (slavery,
subservience, ect.) then Washing-
ton (and Harrisburg, Albany, et.
al.) is the correct place to have
as a focus this November.

The Answer

It seems that at this time the
correct question to ask is not “Can
it work?”, but rather, “Do we even
want to verify its very existence
by asking the first question?’’
Reformers will live, work, and die,
but prepetrate exactly that which
needs to change. Of course, I
haven’t THE answer. But I do
know now that there is absolutely
nothing worth “saving” or work-
ing for iin a system which defines
men and their relationships to
themselves and each other as ours
seems to do, with its peculiar em-
phasis on screwing before you get
screwed.

On the other hand, I think it
unfair of Rick Vance (and also
evidence of hisown guilt, paranoia,

and inability to act) to chastize
freaks for being hypocritical. I do
not know exactly (or even close
to exactly) what to do now. But
the first thing I think I must do
is not to recognize the validity of
the existing “reality.” And unfort-
unately (for you, Mr. Vance), this
first “positive” negation of “real-
ity’ as a non-reality appears as
no action at all.

Rick, I belive you to be wrong.

Struggling for meaning,
I remain peacefully,

Course Guide
To the Editor:

I would like to address an open
letter to Charles A. Mussman, Edi-
tor of the Bucknell Course Guide.

Apropos your recent appeal for
recommendations and opinions con-
cerning the Bucknell Course Guide
and professor and course evalua-
tion generally, let me say that
while I agree with your belief, ex-
pressed in your letter of September
20, that clearer and fuller descrip-
tions of courses should be available
to students, including a list of read-
ings and some hints regarding writ-
ten and oral assignments, I am
nevertheless convinced that such
abstractions can never be wholly
satisfactory.

Furthermore a method of evalua-
tion such as that used for the Buck-
nell Course Guide has proven woe-
fuddy inadequate, resulting, accord-
ing to the opinion of many, in what
could only be regarded as gross
misrepresentations of many cour-
ses.

Polling the class membership and
abstracting a majority or average
opinion can never produce an
evaluation useful to all students,
particularly not to the best stu-
dents

The surest guides to a given pro-
fessor and course appear still to be
the traditional ones: recommenta-
tions of fellow students and pre-
registration interviews with the in-
structor.

These, to be sure, are not fool-
proof, but in the case of the former
one has, after all, an estimate of
the intelligence and taste of one’s
friends and can thus weigh their
recommendations; and by recourse
to the latter one diminishes the risk
of surprise and disappointment at
expecting a reputedly amiable Dok-
tor Faust and finding instead a
cynical and mocking Mephisto.

Murder

To the Editor:

There can be heard at this time
a multitude of pleas for humanity.
Protests against the war in Vietnam
can be heard from everywhere.
People are constantly shocked by
stories of babies burning in napalm
fire and dying in massacres. Mean-
while even more shocking events
are occurring at home. On our
campuses a service is being set up
from which a girl can get informa-
tion on how to obtain an abortion
at a reasonable price. This service
carries out a program of death even
more ruthless than that of the
underworld’s Murder Inc. since it
is aimed at the defenseless fetus.
This service puts a black mark on
a basically good organization the
Crisis Intervention and Birth Con-
trol Information Service. The head
of the service, also president of the
senior class, tosses off such phrases
as, “I helped a girl an abortion to-
day” with as little emotion as say-
ing he helped her with her home-
work. Yet this person would de-
nounce the accidental killing of
babies during warfare as inhumane.
Murder is murder no matter what
it is called. From the moment of
conception a human being is cre-
ated and has all the rights of the
already born. What has happened

to our university when we allow
such hypocrites to become our lead-

boycotted by the student body until
such time as both its head and the
Abortion Referral Service are re-
moved.

Koenraad Vandegaer ’74

UC
To the Editor:

The primary concern of the Uni-
versity Committee on Dining Halls
should not be the question of inter-
mixing freshmen and upper-
classmen, but rather the alleviation
of the severe overcrowding of the
cafeterias.

Symptoms of this overcrowding
include the unplesantly noisy,
include the unpleasantly of U.C.,
the waits of twenty minutes or
more to be served, and the long,
often chilly, lines extending out the
doors of Larison and U.C.

A solution to the problem would
be the extension of lunch and din-
ner hours fifteen minutes on each
end of the present hours. For ex-
ample, Monday-Friday lunch would
be served from 11:30-12:45.

One excuse for not implementing
this plan would be the cry lack of
funds for the extra labor required.
I see two possible sources of re-
venue.

First, unnecessary personnel,
such as U.C.’s “bread lady” should
be eliminated.

Secondly, Bucknell over-accepted
150 freshmen. These students have
paid for board, and part of this
board money was allocated for
labor. I have not noticed any sig-
nificant increase (if there has been
any increase at all) in the number
of cafeteria staff members, so this
money should still be available for
overtime for the existing staff.

I recommend implementation of
this plan immediately, as current
conditions make eating at the Uni-
versity Dining Halls something less
than a culinary delight.

Peace Candidate Emphasizes
Nation’s Economic Recession

By JAN WILLIAMS

This Saturday the Student Move-
ment for Peace is sending a group
of students to Camp Hills, Penn-
sylvania to campaign for Arthur
Berger, Democratic candidate for
congress from the Nineteenth Con-
gressional District.

The movement has chosen to ex-
pend its primary effort in the sup-
port of Berger. He is also supported
by the Movement for a New Con-
gress & Referendum °70.

All students interested in going
should meet in New Dorm at 8:45
a.m. Saturday morning. Various
similar trips will occur during the
next few weeks.

Berger addressed a group of stu-
dents here Wednesday night in re-
gards to his campaign. He spoke
briefly about his basic policies and
beliefs, and then fielded questions
from the audience.

Over-spending in the nation’s
military programs and the result-
ing economic recession are the pri-
mary issues on which he is basing
his campaign. He feels that neither
of these problems are going to be
solved until we are out of vietnam.
Once we are out of Vietnam, the
first job to be done is to ‘‘dismantle
the third-largest country in the
world: the U.S. pentagon.”

On the issue of the war itself,
Berger resents the insincerity of
President Nixon in trying to get us
out of Vietnam. He feels that it
would be just as easy to leave now

AWS

(Continued from Page 1)

Recent changes in the present
constitution will be voted on shortly
by all women students. During this
year, AWS will operate with the re-
vised constitution and its present
membership, as both a regulating
and programming body.

During the past two weeks, Sen-
ate members have visited fresh-
men women’s hallgroups to ac-
quaint them with AWS, past, pres
ent and future.

The AWS Senate within the past
month has developed a series of
programs for the coming year

Thursday, Nov. 5, a one-day bus
excursion to New York City will be
sponsored for any wonman student
interested in shopping, touring,
theatre going, etc. The student’s
time will be her own

The transportation cost is $5 and
a maximum of 41 students can be
accomodated.

A second trip for the following
Thursday, Nov. 12, will be con-
sidered if interest is as great as
expected. The time and place for
sign-ups will be announced shortly.

Plans are underway for WOT
Weekend, Women of Today, to be
sponsored by the AWS chapters of
Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, Lycom-
ing, and this University.

A series of speakers will deal
with the problems women face in
society and with opportunities for
women after graduation.

Other projects include a typing
and shorthand class and the Fresh-
men Women’s Sex Lecture to be
presented this Sunday at 2:00 p.m.
Also, a reference booklet will be
compiled of the majors, present
jobs, and salary ranges of women
who have graduated from the Uni
versity in the past three years

A suggestion was brought up by
Frederick for protestors to sign up
to talk with the recruiter in hopes
of delaying actual recruitment. An-
other idea which will develop along
with peaceful demonstration is a
debate to be started out in front of
Carnegie Building during the day.
In this way, interested participants
and bystanders can make their
opinion known, pro or con.

At the meeting, Frederick com-
mented, “I’m just frustrated, not
only because of the military, but
also I’m upset with a lot of things
both inside and outside.’’ About the
movement, he said, “‘It’s only one
thing I can do now. I can see stu-
dents doing a lot more.’’ He went
on in retort to a question raised
against the group’s objectives, ‘I
would like to see change. We need

as it will bein several years.

Another of the important issues
that Berger emph es was that
‘we are having constitutional crisis
without realizing it.”

Two problems point this out, ac-
cording to Berger, the Cambodian
invasion last spring raises the
serious questions of who is really
running the country and making
the important decisions.

The frustrating slowness of the
workings of Congress is the second
problem. If elected, Berger plans
to join those Congressmen who are
trying to eliminate the seniority
system from Congressional proce-
dire.

On foreign policy, Berger stated
that the United States definitely
learned something in the Middle
East situation: that we don’t have
to send troops into every troubled
area to preserve world peace. How-
ever, our basic foreign policy trends
definitly needs a revision.

Now, according to Berger, we
have no workable foreign policy
rules.

Berger is a Democrat running
in a_ historically Republican dis-
trict. His opponent is 74 year old

umbent George Goodling. Ac-
cording to Berger, ‘“‘Goodling is an
old-school politician, and completly
out of touch with American poli-
tics.”

Finally, despite his liberal lean-
ings, Berger stressed that he is
definitely a flag waver. He be-
lieves that our tradition of freedom
is very meaningful, ‘‘one of those
sacred things.”

It was also announced that stu-
dents will be collecting money for
the Congressional Action Fund in
the dorms this week. All donors
will also be requested to vote for
a candidate that they would like
to see supported by this fund

what began to happen was that
more and more interest was evinc-
ed in the work of a University
theatre—after a while, the notion
of a University theatre began to
develop and courses were insti-
tuted.
When I first started, I had a
single colleague, Dr. C. Willard
Smith, former chairman of the
English Department. In those days,
as known as ‘Mr. Cap & Dag:
ger;’ he used to direct, do some
acting, and take on a great deal
of the designing and technical di-
rection.

Next week, in the concluding part
of this series, Mr. Powers discusses
his work on the committee on Afro-
American studies, the role of work-
shops at this University, and the
existence of the ‘new theatre’
among other subjects.

Two of the top show-downs of the
1970 football season are highlights
of Saturday’s schedule. One game
is in the Midwest, the other in the
Far West. Chief Loser-of-the-Close-
Ones, 17th-ranked Stanford, squares
off against 4th-ranked Southern Cal.
Ghe Trojans, out after an unprece-

this year.

The difference: Southern Cal by

In the other big one, once-tied
Nebraska, sixth in the nation, goes
against once-beaten Missouri, rated
13th. This little bit of football dyna-

tea leaves spell out a big win for
Nebraska over Missouri by four
points.

billed as one of the feature games
of the season.

Well, not so this year. Number
One Boy, Ohio State, will smother
Michigan State a bit . . the spread
is 34 points. Texas, ranked second,
will sink the Sooners of Oklahoma
by 23, and 3rd-ranked Notre Dame
will blitz Army by 42 points.

The Cyclones of Iowa State are
undefeated, and the Green Wave
of Tulane is proud of a three and
one record to date.

However, it looks as though both
bubbles will burst. The Cyclones
run into the Buffaloes, and the
Wave will find Falcons in their
hair.

Tenth ranked Colorado will stop
Iowa State by 14 points, and the
sth-ranked Air Force will defeat
Tulane by eighteen points.

Seventh-ranked Auburn will stay
on ye olde victory trail, beating
Clemson by 32. Michigan, No. 14,
will battle Purdue in a feature at-
traction in the Big Ten. The Boiler-
makers slipped back into the Top
20 this week - they’re No. 19.

THE BUCKNELLIAN

Victory

By ALAN GROCHAL

Sophomore Rick Diez keyed a
rejuvenated Bison running attack
in the Big Blue’s 146 victory over
Gettysburg.

Rick carried the ball 17 times
for 87 yards and scored one touch-
down. His longest run from scrim-
mage was 23 yards.

Although most of the fourth quar-
ter was played under a heavy
downpour, Diez noted that the mud-
dy field didn’t bother him.

“We used soccer cleats which
gave us traction on the wet field,”
he said.

Previously, he saw much action
against Baldwin-Wallace but ac-
cumulated little playing time in the
Temple game.

Suprisingly Rick finds his 6’2”,
190 pound frame a small disadvan-
tage.

“J wish I were a little shorter
since I have a tendency to straight-
en up on running plays. Also, I
wish I were a little heavier,” he
said.

As a fullback, it is Rick’s job to
block for quarterback Greg Doviak
or Howie Burke on pass plays, thus
size is important.

Diez characterized himself as
more of an inside threat than an
outside runner. He feels that he is
strong, but lacks great speed.

Rick classified Gettysburg as
larger than either Temple or Bald-
win-Wallace, the teams that the
Bisons faced previously.

“Gettysburg wasn’t as quick as

Over G-burg

Baldwin-Wallace however,and our
offensive line was able to open up
some good holes in the line.”

Diez expects no offensive
changes for the Thundering Herd’s
game with Davidson Saturday.

“Davidson is a combination of
the strengths of Gettysburg and
Baldwin-Wallace. They are both
quick and big.”

In only his first season as a run-
ning back, Diez was a quarterback
through high school in Western
New York and in freshman ball
last year.

Academically, Rick is majoring
in math, a curriculum which he
admits is quite tedious.

“Although being a math major
is difficult, I don’t think that play-
ing football and keeping up with
school work is too hard. If I were-
n’t playing football, I would find
something else to do.”

VOLUME LXXIII—NO. 10

PRESS BOX

By DAN MILLE

The Bucknellian one week ago published an editorial suggesting that
the University’s financial crisis might be eased by reducing the inter-
collegiate football program to club status.

The editorial avoided however, any mention of quantitative data con-
cerning the source and amounts of the savings that would accrue to the
University by virtue of a limited athletic program. Further, is avoided
consideration of other repercussions such a move could have with regard
to the University’s financial situation.

In the first place, club football, as it is presently established in col-
leges accross the country, is intended to be an intermediate between a

By CATHY EVANS

Bryn Mawr College is the only school in Pennsylvania still hold-
ing out against the Haverford agreement with the PHEAA, (Pen-
nsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency) which provides
scholarships or funds to Pennsylvania students attending college
anywhere. Bryn Mawr has, thus far, lost $26,606 in scholarship
funds for 32 students, and $229,950 in loan funds for 34 others. The

non-existant football program and a intercollegiate level of competition.

Schools such as Fordham, the University of Chicago, and George-
town ersity have had club football programs for five years or sO,
and are now entering the lists as intercollegiate competitors.

The contention that club football would reduce expenditures to any
large extent is largely erroneous. The categories that involve the invest-
ment would remain unchanged in a transition between club football and
ava ty program.

For example, what reduction would there be in coaching staff re-
quirements? Are we to realistically expect that a program designed to
“serve more students” would involve fewer coaches? The expenditures
for equipment would obviously increase if more people played.

Travel ts would be just as likely to rise as to fall since many of the
club teams are well removed from central Susquehanna Valley.

What about officials? Most club teams play six to eight games a
season which indicates that there would be little gained in this respect.
Other expenses involve insurance and grounds keeping costs, also unlikely
to decrease to any measurable extent.

Where then are these savings to come from? The category of fi-
nancial aid to athletes is apparently the most likely target. The money
alloted to covering tuition costs of football players has been generally
considered to be separate from that going to “real students.”

This is a misapprehension because football players are not on campus
primarily to perform on Saturdays or to give the sports editor something
to put on his page, They are members of the academic comunity. They
enter Bucknell on the strength of their academic achievements in high
school not on their ability to run off-tackle.

Furthermore, financial aid is not given preferentially to athletes as an
enticement to come to Bucknell. The recruiting effort has only two real
incentives to induce an athlete to enroll: the caliber of the academic
facilities and the quality of competition in the athletic program.

The University can not and pointedly refuses to attempt to purchase
the services of a particular athlete.

The financial gains then, of downgrading football to a club basis, are
largely illu

The drawbacks presented by a less prestegious football program are
more difficult to assess,, but there is evidence that they would be signifi-

As e test case, we can examine Columbia University, a major pri-
vate college

Columbia ran about $10 million in the red last year and investigated
the sibility of altering the athletic program to aleviate the financial
squeeze

The investigating body reported that the. decline in the quality of
athletics at Columbia contributed to the deficit. They further asserted
that nothing can stimulate gifts from alumni better than pride and loyalty
for the alma mater, and that the most effective force to this end was a

uccessful athletic program, the major contributor being football.

A similar panel at Gettysburg College concured.

Therefore, upon investigation of the proposal of The Bucknellian
editorial Board, it becomes clear that slicing the money budget is not
a panacea for the University’s financial illsm in fact there is evidence that
it would amount to killing the goose who laid the golden egg.

By JAMES NORTHRIDGE

The Davidson Wildcats will have
their claws sharpened and un-
sheathed to welcome the Big Blue
to their den this Saturday. David-
son is 1-1 on the season so far as
they defeated Richmond 14-5 before
falling to Trinity (Texas) 20-9.

The Cats are a big team both on
the line, which averages 203
pounds, and in the backfield but
they stress team speed more than
size.

The speediest Wildcat is split
end Rick Lyon, a 5-10 junior, who
was the Southern Conference’s 220
yard sprint champion as a sopho-
more. The wide receiver has a
good pair of hands and excellent
moves as he showed on a 73 yard
punt return against Richmond.

Another stalwart for Davidson is
200 pound fullback Mike Mikolay-
unas, a 6-1 senior. Mikolayunas is
considered to be a pro prospect
and last year he set a single game
pass reception record for Davidson.
The fullback is a powerful runner

and has already latched onto 10
tosses for 138 yards this season.

Lyon and Mikolayunas have
forced B.U.’s Head Coach Fred
Prender to abondon his zone pass
defense as he is assigning two
people to play head to head on the
Davidson stars.

The Wildcats offensive backfield
also includes Mark Thompson, who
so far this season has completed
a strong 26 out of 48 passes good
for 290 yards with only one inter-
ception. Bill Bracken, the team’s
leading rusher and big 198 pound
John Ribet hold down the halfback
slots.

The Wildcat’s defensive second-
ary will prove to be another stiff
test for starting quarterback Howie
Burke. Wildcat monster man John
Barber is an excellent tackler and
he blocked two punts in the Trinity
game.

Coach Prender feels that David-
son is “probably the most experi-
enced football team we’ve played
this season with 15 seniors starting.

Netmen Ranked Eighth in East “conus em

By J. F. LACKRITZ

Last weekend, the Bison tennis
team traveled to West Point to
compete in the ECAC fall tennis
tournament. The netmen showed
that they again have a strong team,
after running up 1714 points, which
placed them among the top eight
teams in the Eest.

Paving the way were senior cap-
tain Alex Anderson, and junior
Steve Baird, each gathering 3%
points in the ‘‘A” division.

Baird defeated two opponents
from Dartmouth and Cornell be-
fore bowing to Bill Colson, the
eventual winner from Princeton.

To Lock Haven, 10-0

By BOB WENDEL

Girls’ field hockey has played
two games to date, and after de-
feating Susquehanna last week,
succumbed to a very potent Lock
Haven State team, 10-0.

The game didn’t start out to be
quite the rout it finally became;
however, after 20 minutes into the
first half, right wing Widget Crane
was injured.

“This was a very demoralizing
situation for the girls. They just

will reach another
milestone Saturday afternoon at 1
p.m. as the Bisons cross country
team looks for its first win in his-
tory at their first home meet -
ever.

This years’ squad is
sophomores comprising seven of
the to eleven runners. Coach Gul-
den, who will also be making de-
but for the hero, reports that the
team is ‘“‘progressing well.” He
admits, however, that it is “dif-
ficult to start and build a team in
one year.”

Although only two men have ever
run in a five mile race before the
time trials earlier this week, the
team is coming on strong. Last
week each man ran 55 miles or
nearly a thousand miles total for
the seventeen man team.

The new B.U. course is 5.1 miles
around the campus and the present

young with

record is held by Tom Haggerty,
who toured the course in 29:20.
Coach Gulden, though, sees any of
eleven men as being able to finish
first on the team.

He has been ‘‘very pleased with
the teams attitude toward work”

and encourages everyone to sup- |

port the Bison’s home debut against
Rutgers.

The race will start and finish by

the soccer field and a good turn- |

out would be important to the team.
Hopefully, success will follow the

hard hours of work that the entire |

team has put in.

at that point was 0-0, but from then
on, the girls played much too de-
fensively,” explained Miss Peck.

She went on to say that, ‘In the
past few seasons we haven’t scored
a goal against Lock Haven.” From
watching the game, and inquiring
of some of the spectators, it be-
came quite evident why Lock Ha-
ven is so tough: many of the play-
ers are Phys. Ed. majors, and are
in exceptional shape, athletically.

Concerning Widget Crane’s con-
dition, Miss Peck stated that she
aggravated her knee severely, and
will be a big question mark for
the near future.

The team still has three games
remaining, as they meet Penn
State this Tuesday, Bloomsburg
Wednesday October 221, and Mes-
siah the following Wednesday.

In contests last year, B.U. de-
feated Penn State 3-2, and bowed to
Bloomsburg 43. “I feel that we
should win two of the next three
contests, and possibly even sweep
all three,” beamed Miss Peck.

N.Y. Times — Duke University is installing

Terry Sanford,

former governor of North Carolina as its president. The antithesis
of Agnew, Sanford is contemplated as the Democtatic candidate
for Vice-President in 1972. Sanfor notes, “With the self-righteous-
ness of oligarchs, the leaders of repression are commanding college
presidents to put down the students, shut off and to silence protest.
I would suggest that they do not understand young people, do not
understand society and have forgotten the lessons of history.”

the Day Care Center as such, as “unrealistic” and said it should
be used soley by students if that. Until legal proceedings are over
the center has been housed temporarily by such organizations as the

SAE Convention Resolves Issues

By NANCY GRDEN

Thirty-five .delegates from 15
Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapters in
neighboring universities gathered
here this weekend to resolve sev-
eral issues of mutual concern.

The members of this province, in-
cluding Penn State, Dickinson, Get-
tysburg, Lafayette, the University
of Pittsburgh, and the University of
Pennsylvania, wish to recommend
to the national conference, which
meets in June in Richmond, that
several changes be made in the
national laws.

One such change would include
the initiation of non-male members
into the fraternity. Several chapters
have a “little sister” set-up, similar
to a sorority in nature, but which
is not part of the national laws.

Another change would include the
institution of an Intercollegiate
Council to improve communications
between the various chapters in the
province and the national. Each
chapter elects one representative
to attend the meeting twice a year.
Chip Del Coro has been elected as
representative of the University’s
SAE chapter and as vice-chairman
of the Council.

Right now this province consists
of 17 members, the largest pro-

Wheatcroft’s ‘Ofoti’
Tells Modern Fable

By ROBIN BITTERLICH

“Ofoti,” a three act play written
by Professor John S. Wheatcroft
of the English department, has just
been published in book form both
in the U.S. and in England. Writ-
ten originally as a stage play,
“Ofoti” was first performed by
cap and Dagger in 1960. It won the
Alcoa Playwriting Award in 1965.

In 1966, the play was transformel
into a television play and was pro-
duced by the American Conserva-
tory Theatre and Station WQED-TV
in Pittsburgh. The TV proluction
was then purchased by National
Educational Television Playhouse
where it won the NET award in
1966. The play appeared on national
television from 1966 to 1970, With
publication, the rights of the play
are returned to Professor Wheat-
croft.

The play was again written for
the stage and was produced in At-
janta in the spring of 1968. In it’s
final form, as it appaers in the re-
cent publication, “‘Ofoti” is in read-
ing form, most similar to the stage
version.

“Qfoti is described as a modern
fable. The narrative is a fantasy
about a boy in search of a troll.

broken up into two smaller pro-
vinces: East, which will consist of
chapters in eastern Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, and Delaware, and
West, which will consist of chapters
in western Pennsylvania, part of
New York, and West Virginia. Be-
cause the University and Penn
State are on the border line be-
tween the two new provinces, each
one may elect to become part of
either the western or the eastern
province.

Other business included a discus-
sion of the tenure of national of-
ficers and a different system of
electing them

Villanova, Drexel, and New York
Institute of Technology all appealed
for initiation into the national chap-
ter, which the province will recom-
mend.

Also discussed was the Alumni
Commission, appointed to govern

the activities of the SAE chapter
here, as it is located off-campus.
However, it has functioned in a
limited capacity and has been lift-
ed both here and at the University
of Pittsburgh.

Included among the guests for
the weekend were Russ Heuer, Em-
inent Supreme Herald; Fred Phel-
ps, an officer of th province; Ken
Tracy, chapter counselor and guest
speaker at the banquet; and John
Stone, head of the leadership school
held every summer in Evanston,
Illinois. Gerald Commerford, as-
sistant Dean of Men, greeted the
delegates when they arrived at the
SAE house, where they stayed dur-
ing the weekend

“Jt is amazing what was done in
one day,” commented Maury Si-
mon, SAE chapter President. ‘We
broke up into discussion groups all
day Saturday and got a great deal
accomplished.”

Premiere Highlights
1971 Chorale Season

By BILL WHITNEY

The University Chorale, under the
direction of Allen W. Flock, has
planned an active schedule for the
1970-71 year.

The highpoint of the Chorale sea-
son will be reached on May 1 at
8:30 p.m. when forty selected mem-
bers of the Chorale will participate
in the Word Premiere of “Piers
Plowman” by Dr. John Wheat-
croft and Thomas Beversdorf.

The text, written by Dr. Wheat-
croft, Professor of English here, is
an adaption and dramatization of a
14th century Middle English poem
depicting the cycle of Christ’s life
in a 14th centlry perspective.

The musical score for forty
voices and orchestra is being com-
posed by Dr. Beversdorf, Professor
of Composition at Indiana (Pa.)
University, who is in residence in
Lewisburg for the year. Mr. Flock
will conduct the musical part, and
Dr. Harvey Powers, professor of
English, will direct the dramatics.

Speaking of the Chorale in gen-
eral, Mr. Flock said it “gives stu-
dents who like to sing the oppor-
tunity to sing and more thoroughly
understand the art of music.”
_.The Chorale will travel to Atlan-
tic City, N. J., Saturday, February
27, 1971 to sing for the Eastern
Division meeting of the Music Ed-
ucators National Conference.

Together with a wind ensemble
from the Symphonic Band, “the
Chorale will be one of the featured
groups, performing pieces for voice
and ensemble by contemporary

composer's Latham and Persichetti
at an evening concert,” said Con-
cert Manager Jeanne Brockmeyer.
The University Chorale will per-
form with the Pennsylvania Ballet
Company, Monday March 1, which
is coming to campus as part of the
Artist Series. With the Ballet furn-
ishing dancers and the orchestra
and the Chorale performing the

had taken in the previous year. He
called attention to the committee’s
charge, which was to “study Uni-

Reece Speaks on Peace;
Students Canvass District

By JACK SCHMIDT

Norval D. Reece will be speak-
ing on the topic, ‘‘Peace Politics:
Where Is It Going?”, in Olin Sci-
ence Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. on
Thursday night.

The talk is being sponsored by
“Students for Peace” and the Inter-
national Club.

In related activities, a group of
students are working for Congres-
sional candidate Arthur L. Berger
in the Nineteenth District, south of
Harrisburg. This weekend the
group plans to begin door-to-door
canvassing efforts with the help
of volunteers from Movement for
a New Congress chapters from the
Philadelphia area.

Reece ran as an independent
peace candidate for the United
States Senate in the 1970 Demo-
cratic Primary. He has served as
Pennsylvania Campaign Manager
and National Scheduling Director
for Senator Eugene J. McCarthy,
and was endorsed by Senator Mc-
Carthy in the 1970 campaign.

At 36, Reece has been a cam-

paign consultant for both Republi-
can and Democratic candidates in-
cluding Senator Joseph S. Clark,
Philadelphia District Attorney Ar-
len Spector, Senator McCarthy, and
Milton J. Shapp.

Reece heads Norval D. Reece As-
sociates, consultants on urban af-
fairs and political campaigns.

The ‘Students for Peace” group
working for Berger will be leaving
for his district at 10:00 am. on
Saturday the 17th, from New Dorm
parking lot. Last Saturday, the
group spent the day leafletting
shopping centers and conducting a
telephone poll of the district.

The group hopes to maintain a
regular weekend presence in the
district through election day.

Berger has been hampered by a
lack of student ‘support from col-
leges within his own district. An
organizer from MNC national head-
quarters is planning to begin work
this week to swell the student
ranks. Berger has noted that stu-
dent support may prove to be the
deciding factor in the election, if
it can be mobilizzed.

Study Monkey Business
Poliner and Nourse Receive Psychology Grant

Juniors, Jay R. Poliner and
Daniel Nourse have been desig-
nated undergraduate research par-
ticipants by the National Institute
of Health for the 1970-71 academic
year.

In this capacity Poliner will con-
tinue his studies of primate be-
havior under the direction of Dr.
Douglas K. Candland, professor
and chairman of the university’s
department of psychology.

Nourse will continue his studies
of primate behavior under the di-
rection of Dr. Candland.

Nourse has done extensive work
with monkeys in field situations,
and will continue the work he in-

itiated last January when he spent
the month with other university
students cataloging the behavior of
free ranging monkeys in Monkey
Jungle in Goulds, Florida.

Further cataloging has been done
by other students during the past
spring and summer with the result
that information is now available
on the full year’s breeding cycle
of the squirrel monkey.

Using the facilities of the Freas-
Rooke Computer Center, Nourse
will catalog the 25,000 behaviors
which have been observed in order
to determine the conditions which
led to the occurence of specific be-
haviors.

Poliner will continue the work he
began during the past summer in
which he is attempting to deter-
mine the nature of the endocrine
factors which are associated with
changes in heartrate that occur
when monkey and baboon social
organization is disrupted.

Along with other workers in the
laboratory, he has established that
profound heartrate changes appear
when primates reorganize their
social structure, and it is supposed
that these reflect changes in the
physiology of the individual animal
which are important to his long-
evity.

In Pursuit of the

To pursue Truth wherever it may
lead demands that one be free to move
in all directions. To this end, we propose
the institution of a General Major.

A student who declares his major
to be General would be allowed to take
courses without being hampered by hav-
ing to fulfill the requirements of a major
chosen in the past on the basis of ‘“‘in-
adequate information.” If a student is
truly learning, what he learns today will
effect what he will decide to study to-
morrow.

In effect, this would mean that stu-
dents who declared their major as Gen-
eral would graduate without having to
first stipulate and then fulfill a very
particular course of study.

In a broad sense, the University
would stop visualizing itself as a place
where people come to achieve goals they
established before they came. The Uni-
versity might begin to recognize the im-
portance of choosing the goals them-

Arthur Berger

Arthur Berger is the Democratic candidate for
Representative in the Nineteenth Congressional Dis-
istrict of Pennsylvania. He is opposing the incumbent,
Republican Representative George Goodling. Although
this district, which includes the cities of Carlisle, Han-
over, and York, is fifty miles to the south, The Buck-
nellian feels it important to comment on this race.

Berger has called for the complete and immediate
withdrawal of all United States forces from Vietnam
and has pledged to help “dismantle the third largest
country in the world: the U. §. Pentagon.” He has also
called for reforms in the tax structure and for stiffer
anti-pollution programs, but places these in the context
of the v saying “We can talk about programs and
priorities forever, but until we get out of Southeast
Asia, our talk is meaningless.”

Goodling, 76 years old, has served in the House
since 1960 and is ranked as the most conservative rep-
resentative from this state. He supports the ABM and
voted with the administration on the church-Cooper and
Hatfield-McGovern Amendments.

Despite the lack of political experience on the part
of himself and his staff, Berger is given a good chance
to win in this relatively conservative district. Berger
posesses no magical powers and only pledges to do the
job he can to “bring America out of its state of
crisis.’ He is an honest man whose political naiveness
may be one of his more important assets.

The Berger-Goodling contest presents a clear
choice on the important issues of Vietnam and defense
spending. Although Berger’s election will serve as no
panacea, it would provide another vote for those Con-
gressional forces seeking to adapt the American po-
litical system to its current challenges. We support Mr.
Berger’s attempts to gain election, and urge members
of this community to aid him towards this end.

The Senate: Why?

By ROBERT WENDE

The students of this University have been betrayed by the faculty
and administration. There is presently a document known to most stu-
dents here at good old Bucknell as “The Senate.”

When this document first came to the attention of the students, it
seemed that finally, conservative Bucknell University had decided that
the caliber of student which this institution enrolls was capable of tak-
ing part in the ‘“‘running of the University.” Most of the students, myself
included, found it hard to believe that the faculty would ever admit that
the average concerned student could rationally pass judgements on mo-
tions concerning the operation of the whole Bucknell community.

From the very first Faculty meeting on governance, it became ob-
vious that passage of such a proposal would be difficult, However, with
students jamming the balcony as the final vote approached, it seemed
that the Senate might have a chance. It was apparent that a majority was
for the document, but whether 2/3 were for it seemed questionable. It
seemed absurd from the beginning that it should take a 2/3 majority.
Anything as controversial as a new governance body, with student par-
ticipation, would be hard pressed to gather that much momentum. Not
only that, since the Senate takes power away from the faculty and gives
it to the students, to expect the faculty to pass the document is like ex-
pecting the state legislature to lower its own salaries.

Then the day for the vote arrived. To the astonishment of almost
everyone, it almost passed. Of course by the time of the body had decided
to vote, the document was considerably watered down. Then, the docu-
ment was referred to a new committee, with the intention of making the
whole thing more palatable for those who felt that the students were get-
ting too much. This new document is now with us, and all indications are
that it resembles the original Council proposal much more than the Sen-
ate.

The question now at hand is, does the faculty pass the new pro-
posal simply so that “‘all that time isn’t wasted.” Or do they shoot this
one down too. Furthermore, if it does accept the document, will the ABS
accept it as well. In its present form, the Senate would simply be another
worthless, bureaucratic middle-man, with the power to recommend to
either the faculty, or the ABS, or both, for approval. Since many of those
on the Senate hold keypositions in the two aforementioned groups, why
have the Senate at all. Unless a body with some really effective power,
with the ability to recommend directly to the President is established,
what is the sense of the faculty’s present course. Not only that, in the
Senate’s present form, the student participation is a fraud. In almost
every situation where decisions are made, every student could vote nay,

The Doctor’s Bag

By ARNOLD WERNER
c 1970 CPS

QUESTION: I have a problem which is of some concern to me. The in-
struction booklet that came with my diaphram says that each time you
have intercourse you must insert another applicator full of spermicidal
cream. I anticipate spending a long weekend with my boyfriend soon, and
it strikes me that there might arise a serious, if not messy, situation if
most of the weekend is spent in bed, as I anticipate. Can you offer any
reasonable suggestions or solutions to this problem? I will not take birth
control pills because they make me throw up every time I brush my teeth.
Nor will I consider any other method of birth control.
ANSWER: In this land of leisure and plenty, I should have known that it
was only a matter of time before I received a letter like yours. Your
problem clearly boils down to a matter of timing. A diaphram should be
inserted within two hours of having intercourse and should be left in place
for at least six hours following intercourse. The instruction booklet you
have is essentially correct although intercourse occurring twice in suc-
cession shortly after insertion of the diaphram should not cause any dif-
ficulty. Judicial behavior suggests an additional application of spermicidal
cream (without removing the diaphram!) before intercourse occurs again.
If you want to try a fourth time, you have your choice of using more
cream or having your boy friend use a condom.

Many people make the mistake of not pacing themselves properly on
a long weekend. Careful scheduling of sleep, eating, attendance to other
physiological functions and cautious amounts of sun and exercise usually
permit requisite six-hour post - intercourse interval to occur so that a pit
stop for diaphram change and refueling can take place.

Letters to the Editor

Abortion Rationale. .
To the Editor:

Mr. Vandegaer,

I am not convinced that a legiti-
mate connection exists between the
haphazard, impersonality of na-
palm bombings and the thoughtful
agreement of mother and doctor
that now procedes legal abortions,
but undoubtedly Mr. Vandegaer
feels that abortion counselling is
doing the students on this campus
a severe’ disservice. I only suggest
that he familiarize himself with a
few facts of 1970 life as salient as
the facts of life which make babies:

1. I suggest he read a few of the
longitudinal studies on the lives of
illegitimate children—of their emo-
tional instability, their insecurity,
the total devastation that comes
from knowing you're unloved or
unwanted by your parents. There is
frightening evidence that this is a
slow kind of murder in itself, this
psychological suffering of a child
as defenseless as a fetus, but far
more sensitive and vulnerable to ir-
reparable, probably lifelong dam-
age.

2. Perhaps there is some value
in investigating the current debate
among eminent doctors and scien-
tists as to exactly when the product
of conception becomes a human be-
ing. Life begins at conception, but
what kind of life? No one said with
wholly empirical proof when a fe-
tus is differentiated enough from
other embroyonic forms or from
the mother herself to be an in-
dividual, independent human being,
having ‘‘all the rights of -the al-
ready born.” (from Mr. V’s article
last week) It is so far as a matter
of religious and philosophical con-
jecture, which by no means is com-
pletely argeed upon.

3. One of the most reasonable de-
mands of Women’s Lib. whatever
your view of the overall movement
might be, is to give women the
right to decide if they want to be
“enslaved” (as some put it) into
pregnancy, child-raising, and the
like. Who are you to deny us at
least the choice to have an abortion
or, on the other hand, to consider
it ultimately as “murder,” as wick-
ed as napalm?

4, There are three people be-
sides the unborn child involved in
every “murder” you point to, Mr.
Vandagaer. There is a liscensed
doctor (at least in New York State),
and there are the mother and the
father who have accidentally,
through an act of love (you may
contest that if you like; for some
of us it does exist at that) created
a lifedong burden for themselves
and for their relationship. I remind
you of the ‘‘youth” that marks this
campus, of the immaturity of the
relationships of many young adults
who, nevertheless, have all the sex-
ual equipment and the expertise to
make babies. Their lives and hap-
piness can be considered, too, don’t
you think, as worthy of human
rights and freedoms? In some
cases, too, just what kind of a
home are they going to be able to
provide for a child, financially,
emotionally, and so on?

5. Finally, I can wax as abstract-
ly moralistic as you when you call

an abortion a murder — in reality,
a hard decision made by a woman
whose mind and body are unques-
tionably geared to reproduction and
“motherly love.” I can call up ab-
stractions like “The Population Ex-
plosion.”” I can also abstract and
ask the question: What does this
child born today for that matter,
have to look forward to when he is
an adult, say, in the year 2000? To
me, it is as inhumane, as you put
it, to bring a child today into the
world with the tremendous handi-
cap of unwantedness as it is to
permit the woman to legally decide
not to have that child, whether she

FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK

Athletics and the Senate

By PAUL OSHER

The editorial published in the October 2 Bucknellian concerning
the expenditures of the University on intercollegiate athletics can-
not be ignored on the basis of a journalistic justification such as
was presented by Dan Miller on page 6 in last Friday’s paper. The
central point of the original editorial (which Dan seems to have
missed) is that the University will have to reduce its expenditures
over the next few years in order to remain solvent. In lieu of this
fact it seems that $571,000 for athletics is a sum out of proportion
to the budgets of the rest of the University.

Perhaps club football isn’t the answer. Would an even larger
investment in intercollegiate athletics produce greater alumni sup-
port financially? Does the present program inhibit some alumni be-
cause they dislike our priorities? Should we even waste our time
bothering with the alumni since their contributions to the University,
intellectually, spiritually and financially are minimal?

Right now no one has the answer to those questions, and we
should. The Athletics Department can not supply these figures to
anyone’s satisfaction. There is no bi-partisan study group making
an effort to seek this information, and yet we are rushing head-
long toward a point in time whena decision will have to be made
concerning such items.

cannot afford it, is not emotionally
mature enough to raise it, is not
prepared to marry the father, or
simply wants her rightful freedom
from child-raising ti live her own
young life.

Very sincerely,

To the Editor:

To quote but the words of an an-
onymous Roman Catholic Priest: “I
will consider the fetus a living be-
ing when they start having funer-
als for miscarriages.”

John H. Kueffner

What Next?

One might profit from reading between the lines of the Uni-
versity Senate discussions. Watts and Zeller and other adminis-
trators and trustees have seen what happens at schools where there
are no provisions made for the University to arrive at decisions
concerning these touchy topics, hence their efforts to get some
governing body established. The various interest groups (among
which I would classify the Physical Education and the Intercol-
legiate Athletics Program - inexorably linked) see the writing on
the wall. They have been living on traditions which nowdays have
a tendency to yeild to rational thinking and economics.

In an effort to exclude students from positions with decision
making power, they hope to preserve their jobs. Their concerns are
by no means picayune, and any decision that is made should take
the lives and livlihoods of those it will effect into account.

When considering alternatives

Any changes that would be made within the framework of
athletics at the University should be a part of a larger re-structur-
ing of the University. It would behoove the University to define its
objectives before instituting any new programs.

and the motion could pass, or vice versa. What is the sense?

It comes down to whether or not we, as a University community,
really want cooperative government. If we really do, than maybe the stu-
dents and faculty should take a good hard look at Lehigh. Last April,
after realizing the absolute worthlessness of a powerless student govern-
ment, their student president disbanded his organization, and suddenly
the Administration found itself without a student governing body. Then,
to top it all off, the students boycotted classes, and stated they would not
return until some substantive measures had been made to define a new
University governance plan. Within two weeks, the Forum arrived, and it
is now in full operation.

I refuse to tell anyone on this campus to boycott classes, because too
many people don’t care enough either way to bother. Not only that, some
students would start bitching about their right to attend classes (poor
dears!). What I am saying is that the faculty should come right out
and say ‘‘you damn kids, why don’t you just be good and stay in your
dorms and study, and leave us alone.”

And the ABS? It might be nice if they told the students exactly what
they think about the whole situation. It’s time the ‘kids’ here realized
that this is exactly what the University, as a corporate body, thinks of
them, and that unless some real commitment on the part of the student
pody is made, the mickey mouse tactics of amelioration will continue.

Bison Booters Tie 2 -2;

Await Penn

By BOB WENDEL

“We played the best soccor game
of the year against Colgate be-
tween the 18 yard lines, but we
just couldn’t put the ball into the
net,” were the words of a very
dejected Coach Reynolds, concern-
ing Saturday’s 2-2 tie with Colgate.
“This was the same score as in
Jast year’s contest, but the games
are not comparable at all. Last
year Colgate gave us a real battle,
but this year we completely dom-
inated the play, unfortunately it

didn’t show up in the score.”
ally, B. U. outshot the
42-20, and Colgate had
17 goal kicks, to less than ten for

the Herd

“TI would say very conservately,
that we missed at least six easy
goals The score could just as
ily have been 5-1,” explained

The scoring was opened by the
Bisons, Steve Gentino scored
on a hard shot during the second
quarter, and as the half closed,
B. U. led 1-0.

In the third quarter Colgate went
out in front on the strength of a
throw in, which was converted,
and a corner kick, on which the
defense got it nals crossed,
and the Raiders capitalized.

B. U. was then forced to come
from behind, and during the last
quarter, Glenn Mars drilled the
ball into the upper right corner of
the net from the 18 yard line.

Summing up the game, Reynolds
said, “It was the most frustrating
game I’ve ever coached-we did
everything better than they did, we
just couldn’t produce.”

This week the Bisons face Penn
State, 2-1 on the year, at College

State, Rider

Park on Wednesday, and Rider on
Saturday home.

Commenteng on the MAC stand-
ings, Reynolds explained that he
felt that in order t owin the di-
vision, an undefeated season will
be necessary, and he felt that the
team to beat this year will be

Big Blue Dumps

By KEN DOAK

A 5 yard touchdown pass from
Howie Burke to Ed McDevitt late
in the fourth quarter, and Dave
Boyer’s decisive extra point, gave
the Bisons an upset win at David-
son Saturday.

Time after time, BU refused to
quit under pressure, and the result
was a 21-20 victory that has to
boost morale tremendously.

The Herd exhibited a balanced
attack, led by the rushing of Rich
Diez (21 carries for 92 yards) and
Don Giacomelli (14 for 62), while
the Wildcats put on an arial dis-
play with Mark Thompson passing
for 405 yards.

The first half was all Davidson,
as Thompson consistently hit flank-
ers Rich Lyon and Mike Mikolay-
unas, on well-timed sideline pat-
terns. However, the Bison defense
was tough when it had to be, until
the Wildcats got on the scoreboard
late in the second quarted as Lyon
made a diving TD grab.

Army, Cornell Down
BU Water Polo Club

By MARK KNODERER

The water polo club ventured to
Cornell last weekend for their first
big test of the season. They failed.
Twin defeats at the hands of Army
and Cornell overshadowed a romp
over an outmanned Villanova squad.

A dissaponited Dick Russell said
“We failed to take the open shot
when we had it. We did not react
when we lost the ball, so Cornell
and Army both had several fast

jes showed a lack of experience,
and the play-calling left something
to be desired.

Coach Lane also felt there was
a lack of leadership on the field,
with no one player taking charge
of the team

Despite the loss, however, the
coach had praise for the fine play
of linebackers Daley and Spirk.

The hope now for the freshmen

idders is to forget the Cornell
loss and concentrate on the games
ahead

break goals.”

Army jumped into a quick 5-3
lead against the Bisons, and in-
creased it to 9-5 at halftime. After
three quarters Army led 13-7, and
the game looked like a rout. The
club showed their mettle, however,
and staged a furious comeback,
outscoring Army 6-2 in the final
quarter, A missed penalty shot in
the closing minutes ended all Bis-
ons hopes, and the Cadets had
earned a 15-13 victory.

Against Cornell the club stayed
even for one quarter, and then fell
apart. The Big Red swam over and
around the Bisons, and. peppered
goalie Jeff Capron with fast break
shots. When the nightmare was
over, Cornell had 22, Bucknell 10.

After resting another hour, the
club took out its frustration on a
Villanova squad which was prob-
ably also feeling the effects of pre-
vious games. Paul Landes, Peter
O’Keffe and Steve Winnings all
racked up five goals, and the club
rolled to a 24-2 win.

Coach Russell observed the Army
Cornell offenses and is instituting a
new variation in the Bison offense,
which stresses breaking across the
pool in front of the goal rather than
having a “hole” man there direct-
ing the attack. The results of the
new strategy will be tested next
Saturday when the club journeys
to Penn State.

The B.U. offense, silent in the
first half, took the second-half kick-
off and quickly marched 79 yards,
helped by John Ondrasik’s 23 yard
catch of a deflected pass and a
pass interference call. Rich Diez
crashed over from the 2, but the
kick was wide.

Davidson soon upped the margin
to 14-6 as Thompson found Lyon on
a 39 yard TD pass.

But again BU bounced back.

Giacomelli made a  one-hand
catch of a sprint-out pass and
rambled 34 yards down the left
sideline, into Davidson territory.

Following a costly clipping pen-
alty, halfback Greg Wright broke
behind a Davidson linebacker, and
took a perfectly thrown pass from
Burke for a 31 yard score.

Bob Ciperson then caught a pass
over the middle for the 2-point con-
version, and it was 14-14.

The Herd quickly found them-
selves behind again. A 35 yard
scramble by Thompson, and a pass
interference call set up a 4 yard
TD strike to Lyon. However, the
PAT attempt sailed wide to the
left.

The next nine minutes saw nei-
ther team able to mount a drive.
An interception by C. B. Mansfield
on the BU 25 stopped one bid, and
a bad clipping call set back a long
punt return by Gene Luccarelli.

Davidson missed a 51 yard FG
with 8:08 remaining, and the final
drive to victory began.

Burke, mixing his plays well, led
a 6 minute march upfield, as BU
came through in every clutch sit-
uation.

A reverse to Ciperson, and his
reception over the middle, gave the
Bisons two key first downs. Two
minutes later, Giacomelli bolted
around right end for a first down
on a fourth-and-1 situation at the
Wildcat 44.

A i5-yarder to Jay Griffin, and
several runs, left third and 5 yards
to go at the 10. Burke then fought
his way to a first down at the 5.

Two plays later, he rolled right,
and found McDevett all alone in
the end zone. Boyer’s PAT made it
21-20.

Davidson

The defense then rose to the oc-
casion, as they forced a punt that
allowed the Bisons to run out the
clock.

Coach Fred Prender had special
praise for offensive linemen Art
Wilkins, Tony Moretz, and Bob
Rohrbaugh, and for Gene Depew
and Mansfield of the defense. The
win, he said, was “the biggest
we've had since I’ve been here.”

Haggerty Leads Herd as
Harriers Override Rider

By DAVE COULTER

The Bison cross country squad
demolished Rider, 16-47, Saturday
afternoon, capturing eight of the
first ten positions.

The 5.1 mile race got off to a
fast start as the Rider team jump-
ed into the lead positions, which
they held for the first mile.

Then the Bison runners steadily
moved up through the pack taking
one of the opposition at a time
until they acquired the formation
of the finish - 1, 2, 3, 4.

The first four on the Big Blue
squad finished within 20 seconds
of one another, a fine team effort.

Finishing first was Tom Haggerty
who bettered the old record by 31
seconds with a 28:49.

Following him for the Blue were
Batram, Lucas, Ledgerwood, Larn-
er, Hydock and Francel. The fresh-
man-ladened team showed a great
improvement over its time trial
marks, indicative of the efforts
made in practice.

Coach Gulden was markedly
pleased with the improvement
which his young team showed and
has now set his sights on the meet
with Juniata and F & M Wednes-
day.

VOLUME LXXIII—NO. 11

Vote Due Monday

By PAMELA MAY

With its ‘restructured core,” the
University Senate Proposal once
again will be subject for evaluation
on the floor of the Faculty Mon-
day.

The new document, according to
John A. Peeler, Professor of Po-
litical Science, one of four com-
mittee members who revised the
proposal, involves a “rethinking of
policy-making and budgetary pro-
cess.”

It differs from the original pro-
posal in that while the Senate re-
tains all power over the Universitp
budgeting and fiscal matters, in-

 structional program has been put
in the hands of the Faculty.

“In the early proposals,” eX-
plained Professor Peeler, “the
wording was both legally and prac-
tically inefficient: it made it ap-
pear like the Senate would be leg-
islating. The Board of Trustees and

ABS Plan Endorses
Activities in Politics

The ABS has endorsed a pro-
posal that would allow students who
wanted to, to take a week off from
classes to campaign for candidates
for public offices.

The plan, brought up by Bob
Naschin, was termed ‘a watered
down Princeton Plan.”

It ‘‘allows the individual to par-
take in local and congressional
~campaigns and does not commit
the University to any political ac-
tivity,” said Naschin.

The ABS recommendation will be
sent to the Secretary of the Uni-
versity.

It states that the students who
wish to participate in a political
activity as an exercise of civic re-
sponsibility would be allowed to
take a one week recess, October 27
to November 3 prior to the Novem-
ber election.

The motion continues, “That any
student who wishes to partake in
this plan must be granted an in-
complete upon dequest realizing
that his academic responsibilities
must be completed by the end of

' Bison Clu

By ERIC RIESS
The Executive Committee of the
Bison Club has announced plans to
donate $26,000 to aid the Uni-

versity’s intercollegiate athletic
program.

In a letter sent to all 911 mem-
pers of the alumnae group, the ex-
ecutive committee announced plans
to donate money for such varied
items as lights for the soccer field
and an unrestricted $5,000 scholar-
ship to a deserving student.

The lights for the soccer field
are currently under construction
and according to director of ath-
leties, Robert A. Latour, “should
be ready by the beginning of next
week.” The lighting will allow the
soccer team to practice into the
early evening hours during day-
light savings time.

The lighting will cost approxi-
mately $2,400 and will be paid for
over a two year period.

A resolution adopted by the ex-
ecutive committee renamed their
annual gift to the University’s
scholarship endowment fund the
John H. Shott Memorial Bison Club
Scholarship Fund, in memory of
John H. Shott, the late director of
alumni relations and secretary to
the club.

President legally have that power,
specific formal duties and rights,
which they cannot and would not
wish to relinquish. It must be re-
membered that any campus body,
including the Faculty, is only ad-
vising the trustees. However, the
Board of Trustees is usually ex-
pected to assume a passive role,
and tends to accept most recom-
mendations.”

The new document more pre-
cisely delineates the areas of con-
cern of each body, the Senate be-
ing the recommending body in
budget and financial affairs, and
the Faculty assuming a like role in
academic affairs.

Professor Peeler believes, ‘The
division of power is more consis-
tent than in the document defeated
in May; it remains less ambiguous
The primary question then was
where the prerogatives of the Fac-
ulty ended and those of the Senate
began.”

“The students are concerned,”
recognized Professor Peeler, “with
not having significant impact on
University policy. They often don’t
realize how much power budgetary
power grants them.”

“Both the Faculty and Senate,”
continued Peeler, “will gain sub-
stantially in influence over Uni-
versity policy. The Senate will de-
termine the over-all picture of re-
sources, that is how they are ob-
tained and spent — the size of
budgeting to the instruction pro-
gram for example as opposed , to
the athletic department or physical
plant.

“The Faculty will allocate the
money allowed by the Senate for
academic matters, that is the Li-
brary, faculty salaries, the com-
puter center, and so forth.”’

To direct the instructional pro-
gram, the Faculty structure pro-
vides for a Committee of Academic
Policy and Resources. This body of
eighteen would contain three stu-
dents, as now written.

“Tt will serve,” outlined Profes-
sor Peeler, ‘‘as the cirriculum com-
mittee of the University Faculty
for the entire University. It will
consider matters of educational
policy not dealt with by the indi-
vidual colleges, for example, the
grading system, or whether to ac-
cept a new department (as may be
the case in Black Studies). The ad-

Athletic Support

ministration has been dominant in
this area in the past.”

“The Senate then becomes the
central representative body in gen-
eral planning of the University,
advising the trustees on general
policies and resources.”

Peeler further specified, ‘The
Faculty retains the last word in in-
structional proceedings This is
‘ustifiable for within a University

s the faculty’s function to super-
vise the academic program: this
is what we are here for. This does
not mean that other points of view

‘Alchemist’ Cast Features
Role-Changing Characters

By BARB FETHEROLF

What are the things an audience
should look for in Cap and Dag-
ger’s production of The Alchemist
this weekend and next?

The play is a fast-moving period
comedy written in 1610 by Ben Jon-
son. The comedy is satirical in na-
ture; the audience should look for
the way Jonson pokes fun at his
characters, who abound with greed
and hypocrisy.

The play, directd by Dennis
Baumwoll, professor of English, is

b Contributes Funds

This year’s $5,000 gift brings to
$25,000 the amount of money that
the club, made up of alumni and
friends of the University who have
a special interest in intercollegiate
athletics, has donated to the Uni-
versity since 1966.

Other items on the budget are
the first $5,000 of a $25,000 com-
mittment given to improve the
locker room facilities on the west
side of Memorial Stadium. The fa-
cilities are being used by the
visiting team during football sea-

son.

The club budget allocates $3035
to purchase a 38 foot square
wrestling mat. The Resilite mat has
been ordered according to Latour
and should be arriving on campus
within the next few weeks.

The final item costing over
$1,000 is a donation to the athletic
department to aid in recruiting ath-
letes. This includes $1400 for foot-
ball, $300 for wrestling and la-
crosse, and $100 each for soccer,
golf, track, and swimming, for a
total of $2400.

Other goals include a golf driving
net, 10 hurdles for the track team,
two instructional films for soccer
and lacrosse and a recruiting film
for the football program, as well

as money for several invitational
track meets in which the winter
track team will participate, and
the annual senior awards banquet
sponsored by the club each year.

This year’s allocations show an
increase of $3,700 over last year’s
budget.

set, (designed by Jim Lyons tech-
nical director of the theatre), and
the elaborate Elizabethan costumes,
which were specially ordered.

Most of the actors are new, with
seven freshmen among the cast of
eighteen.

The three major actors, though
are experienced, and have appear-
ed often on the University stage.
Snoozy White, Charle Pollock, and
Sandi Martin play the roles of the
servant Face, the alchemist Subtle,
and the prostitute Doll Commons,
respectively.

There are several unusual fea-
tures about The Alchemist, one of
which is to be found in the plot—the
changing of roles among the three
major characters.

One should look for a plot which
centers around the scheming efforts
of the accomplices Subtle, Face,
and Doll Commons to make a profit
off of gullible individuals. To do so,
they offer a service in which they
claim the power to change metal
to gold and to tell fortunes. Upon

However, he does state that “Al-

Naschin said, “We have to find

University Receives Grants from Foundations,
Uses Money for Increases in Faculty Salaries

Announcement has been made by
the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
of New York City of the award to
the University of a $200,00 grant
for faculty support, mainly in the
area of humanities.

The University has received an
unrestricted grant of $25,000 from
the United States Steel Foundation.

The grant is one of 25, ranging
from $15,000 to $100,000, made to
colleges and universities by the
U. S. Steel Foundation for major-
purpose or capital needs.

In addition to capital grants to-
talling $545,000, the Foundation’s

aid-to-education program in 1970
includes an additional $1,604,700 in
grants for operating expenses,
gradlate-level fellowships, educa-
tional organizations and associa-
tions, and manpower development.

In announcing the program of
support to the private sector of
the nation’s dual system of educa-
tion, Edwin H. Gott, chairman of
the Board of Trustees of the U.S.
Steel Foundation, pointed up the
vital importance of raising the qua-
lity and improving the effective-
ness of both teaching and learning
in America, as well as providing

educational opportunities in higher
education for all capable youth
who sincerely seek such opport-
unities.

The University is one of 15 pri-
vate, independent liberal arts col-
leges listed by the Foundation as
recipients of Mellon Support
Awards.

According to the Foundation an-
nouncement, the award may be
used for such matters as salary in-
creases, additions to faculty and
paid release time as determined
by the colleges, but may not be

The Senate’s Deficiencies

There are serious shortcomings in
the University Senate and Faculty Re-
organization proposals now under con-
sideration by the faculty. These efforts
by the University at restructuring itself
are subject to both general and specific
criticism.

Opinions concerning the purpose,
goal or direction of the University are
widely divergent. Nevertheless, we sense
the need for the (University to begin to
define its raison d’etre in concrete terms.
The question of how-to-do-it-equitably
then arises, hence the impetus for the
establishment of a University Senate.

The Senate in its present form.
however, will not serve the needs of the
University. The document dated October
9 preserves the Faculty as the elite rul-
ing class on issues that require the at-
tention of the entire University com-
munity.

"The Student as Nigger’

Before students can ever consider
the Senate document, some very basic
changes will have to be effected. The
most important alterations to be made
in the document concerns its attitude to-
ward students in general. In matters
that are of University-wide importance
students are relegated insignificant sta-
tus. One gets the distant feeling that the
Faculty is seeking to minimize student
participation in the governing of the
University. This elitist tendency is most
blatant in the division of labor between
the Senate and Faculty on matters con-
cerning “the development and the use of
financial resources and phy cal facilities
and the priorities and ass umptions guid-
ing these programs.”

With the exception of the Faculty’s
Committee on Elections and Membershi
(the analogue of the ABS Congress
the Senate document), all Faculty com-
mittees should have appropriate student
representation. Where student interests
are of primary concern to a committee,
students should have a dominant role. In
all other cases the number of students
on each committee should approximate
the same proportion as the number of
student members on the Senate proper.

The Faculty Committee on Aca-
demic Policy and Resources (as seen in
the Proposal for Reorganization of Facu-
ty Committees, p. 1) should either be
eliminated or reduced to reporting to the
Senate Committee on General Policy and

make clear that
this is a personal response. No one
person can speak in behalf of the

and as an organization it is purely
that of stressing the need for ad- in the development stage. Right
now it consists of concerned indi-

Resources. In any event, its student
membership should be increased to 6
out of 18 committee members.

It is essential that review of Ath-
letic Department activities be included
under the jurisdiction of a Senate com-
mittee. We propose that such responsi-
bilities be delegated to the Senate Com-
mittee on Student Life.

Necessary Revisions

Student representation is dealt with
erratically throughout the entire pro-
posal. We cannot accept the present
Senate document unless student repre-
sentation is raised to five (5) out of
sixteen (16) on the Committee on Gen-
eral Policy and Resources. On a com-
mittee as important as this, it is essen-
tial that student opinion be adequately
represented.

The Committee of Arbitration is
equally insulting. If it is even main-
tained wthin the document it must be
increased to five (5) members to include
the Associate Secretary of the Senate
and the Vice-President of the ABS.

Student qualifications for Senate
membership cannot be considered with-
in the purview of this document. “All
students enrolled full-time in the regular
academic program of the University
should be eligible for the seven at-large
positions on the Senate. No further cri-
teria are justified (see Proposal for a
Senate, p. 4, paragraph 2). There are
many students experienced in the work-
ings of the University, well qualified for
Senate membership, who do not fall
within the categories stipulated in the
document. To exclude them from eligi-
bility because they have not previously
worked on ‘committees or the ABS Con-
gress would be a grave error, and it
would limit the number and hetero-
geneity of potential candidates.

As regards the Ratification and
Amendment procedures, future amend-
ments by the Congress of the ABS (p.
10, no. 3) should be proposed by a ma-
jority vote as is the case in Stage Two
(p. 9) under Student Ratification of the
Senate.

In conclusion, unless the Faculty
considers the above revisions, we feel
that the Senate document will not meet
the needs of the community.

THe SibDESHOW_—— St

Manson in Hollywood
By DAVID WEINBERGER

It is very strange to sit and watch a movie for two hours and to pe
able to accept it as real. Fortunately we don’t. But unfortunately we do.
We don’t accept it as real for if we did, we would rush out of the theatre
when King Kong raised his arms to get us. We do accept it as real be-
cause when we walk out of the theatre we confuse the picture with “real
life.”

If man lives by myth, and if by myth is meant not fables or fictions
but ways of viewing the world, and if Hollywood is the greatest embodi-
ment of American myths, then these myths are failing us.

Hollywood speaks in terms of repeated situations. The themes are

sparce, originality of situations even rarer. Hollywood repeats itself be-
cause it is telling us of very basic motifs of our lives (this js to Holly-
wood’s economic advantage for we like movies in which we recognize
patterns from our own lives). These basic motifs are our myths. The plots
themselves may vary, but the presuppositions of the plots and the world
that the plots inhabit are patterns of thought that we recognize as our owD-

Living in Cliches

The trouble comes when we begin to see these myths as fictions. We
begin to laugh at the cliches of Hollywood. But if man lives by only a few
themes, if he tends to view himself in a relatively small variety of motifs
(young hero against powerful evil, old pro making a comeback, etc.) he
must necessairly actually live in cliches. There is nothing wrong with liv-
ing in cliches until we begin to degrade them, to see them in terms of
worn out ideas instead of as universal (for our culture) archetypal through
patterns. We all see our world, our situation, as a world with a certain
structure. Hollywood, of course, uses that structure. But it does so so
often that we become aware of it and laugh at it. Our laughter at Holly-
wood makes us laugh at our own lives.

Part of the problem is created by our realization that movies are not
real. They are fictions. With the realization we throw out the very true
myths that Hollywood gives us as fictions. But we need these myths to
structure our world, and what results when the myths explode can be seen
around us everyday.

When the Myths Explode

An extreme example of the kind of confusion that can result can be
seen by looking at ‘‘Alice’s Restaurant.” Arlo Guthrie is a real person
from the real town of Stockbridge where a real Alice and Ray Brock live
in a real church. But then they all became fictionalized through the song
and movie of ‘‘Alice’s Restaurant.’ We believed the movie enough to give
life to the fictional Alice, Ray and Arlo, and we believed the fiction
enough to transform the real people into something somewhat fictional.

Alice Brock played a bit part in the movie while another actress
played her. What could she have been thinking as she watched a stranger
pretend to be her while she pretended to be someone else? When the
camera crews came to Stockbridge and rebuilt Alice’s restaurant and
when all of Arlo’s old crowd came back to hang around and act, what did
the townspeople think was going on? All of a sudden, a part of the town
was living in a past a few years gone. Did the townspeople begin to be-
lieve that in the past the real Alice’s Restaurant was surrounded by
jcamera crews?

All of this leads us up to the more subtle problem of the Manson trial.

Manson in a Screen World

Their is something deficiently weird about the Manson affair. It’s not
the occult activities of his family (Notice how Manson retained the calm
virtue of family life, the same Time Magazine praised The Band for). No,
it’s the incredible mixture of fantasy and reality in the trial.

Manson and his group slaughtered (probably) a group of movie actors
and actresses. Actors and movies live in between reality and fantasy.
They are of course real people which is why one cannot smile when talk-
ing of Manson, but in another sense they are not. They build a world on
a screen and live in it, as the rest of us build a world in “real life’ and
live in it. Actors of course also have their real world, but they character-
jze themselves as actors they are putting more emphasis on the screen
world. “I am an actor” means “I am not like you, for my part in life
has already been written out.” A good actor lives in a world that is
archetypal, in a world that we all live in actually, a world on to which
we've hung our personal effects to eall it ‘‘individual.”

nyone who kills is denying the real world and living in the screen
world. To deny someone alse’s life is very basically to deny all life, to
deny that life is a real thing. To kill you must live in a bad movie. You
must view your victim as the character portrayed by an actor, as 4
fiction.

So Manson is also an actor, a screen person, killing another screen
person. It is useless to speculate why, All we can do now is to see what
happens next.

The media got hold of Manson, and now we are all in his movie, the
shocked witnesses, the angry townsfolk with pitchforks out to get Frank-
enstein’s monster.

Reading about something in the media generally adds a touch of un-
reality. We usually feel no real connection with yhich we read about. Five
hundred dead? Yup, turn the page. But Manson adds a new dimension
because his act itself was only half real.

It’s not necessary to add the usually elements of unreality: the Judge
giving occult Masonic signs to the Bailiff, Linda Kassabina admitting
she’s a murderer to be rewarded with immunity if she’ll implicate Man-
son. No, those touches are only unreal to those of us who think that Justice
in America is real, which seems to be very few of us.

Nixon: A Loveable Actor

And then the final touch. Nixon jumps headfirst into the movie. Who
could have asked for anything more? ‘Manson is guilty,” he said. He
claimed that statement was an accident. It doesn’t matter, what’s im-
portant is that he also explained it as a result of being fired up by John
Wayne in “Chisum.”

Now this is the Nixon we know, the one who said ‘Sock it to me” on
Laugh-in. He is our own loveable actor without reality. And the Presi-
dency is just another summer stock performance for our own entertain-
ment. Too bad Nixon is such a bad actor that he can’t convince us that
he really is the president. Kennedy was so much better at that.

There you have it. Nixon is Manson, doing it to the flickering-image
Viet Cong instead of to Sharon Tate Movie Star who was probably more
eight-by-ten glossy than flesh.

But we elected Nixon in our television set election booths, and watch-
ed him on TV speak to the astronauts on the moon. “Captain Richard
Midnight to Space Probe. Do you read me?” With a decoding ring, a
Beanie, and atomic missles.

The following is the last of a
two-part with Harvey M.

director of the University theatre.
In this interview, Mr. Powers de-

the concepts of the New Theatre
and the existence of worksheps at
this University, and discusses the
background which the University
affords the interested drama stu-
dent. And it is with this topic that
the interview begins.

Survey Reveals Extent

Of Academic Dishonesty

By JANET KOCH

Features Editor’s Note: the fol-
jewing article, written after am ex-
series of interviews, de-
seribes the extent of cheating on
this campus, how such incidents
are handled, and ways in which
cheating can be eliminated. While
much of the article’s content may
seem inconclusive, one must ac
knowledge that the lack of statistics
on cases of cheating and the ob-
vious lack of first hand knowledge
on the subject must necessarily

pres-

of dishonesty
y is difficult to ¢s-
timate. For instance, there are no
statistics ilable, on the number
of students who cheat in a given
exam or Pp rize in the writing
of a  paper—and for obvious
reasons. In an interview with Dr.
Leon Pacala, Dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences, it was arned
that there are, at most, six to
twelve ases a year that are
brought before the board of review
on academic responsibility, but
that represents only a small pe?
centage of the actual number.

Dean Pacala cited the following
as actions which aid the academi-
cally dishonest: the use of similar
exam questions from semester to
semester, the assignment of the
same research paper topics, and
“the age-old tradition of fraternity
files.”

He also believes that many stu-
dents come to the University with
a poor background, that the high
schools fail, in some instances, to

instill in the students “the integrity

interviews regarding ways in which
cheating could be reduced

Dr. Turnure, who has seen an
honor system work in another
school, felt that a similar system
may be the answer here. However,
one must question whether the at-
mosphere here has been cultivated
for that. Dean Pacala noted, “We
do not have rooted in student cul-
ture the kinds of sanctions against
dishones

Other professors feel that, by the
time a student gets to college, he
should have a sense of responsi-
bility, and the professor should not
have to stand over him This view
is held by Dr. Richard J. Peterec,
associate professor of geography
who said that he has “confidence
in the students,” and has seen very
little to make him change his
opinion

Cases of academic dishonesty at
the University are handled by the
board of review on academic re-
sponsibility composed of faculty
and students Although the board
“hasn’t really served as a deter-
rent” ‘according to Dean Pac: -
it has ‘‘protected the individuals
involved in these cases.”

In first instances, the usual pen
alty if a student is found guilty is
an “F’’ in the course involved. The
reasons for the “F’’ are not given
on the student’s record, and any
records of the board are highly
confidential.

Dean Pacala further stated that
“those students who do make mis-
takes come out of the process a
changed person, recognizing how
serious academic dishonesty is.”
Seldom are second instances, for
which the penalty is dismissal, re-
ported.

In Dean Pacala’s nine years at
the University, only two cases of
dismissal from the College of Arts
and Sciences have occurred.

The problem of academic respon-
sibility is a difficult one. Its source
and its elimination rest ultimately

his being the only Black on the

seme justification to that part of
the theory

But, I don’t conceive of a Black
Studies program as being primari-
ly for Blacks. In a predominantly
White institution, a Black Studies
program certainly should offer the
Black students opportunities which
it does not offer; but the pro-
gram ought to be designed, also, to
primarily educate the White stu-
dents at this University. As one
centleman from Glassboro State
College said at one of our meetings
last year, one function of a Black
Studies Program at this University
should be to ‘help our White stu
dents avoid becoming racist by de
fault.’

ence — an attempt to involve the
audience in a performance There
is also a very heavy emphasis on

Amendments

(Continued from Page 1)
amendments are a few basic things
we can agree on.”

Another, amendment provides for
the addition of two students to each
of the Faculty Committees on Aca-
demic Freedom and Tenure, Hon-
arary Degrees and Scholorly De-
velopment. The reasoning was that
“Students have to be heard,” said
Naschin,

There was also discussion on the
Future Amendments to the Senate
to change the vote of two-thirds to
read, “By the voting members of
the Congress of ABS by a vote of
a majority of the members voting
on the question.”

The first amendment is to delete
a paragraph under the functions of
the Senate. It states that “the Sen-
ate will make no recommendations
regarding the use of the portion of
the University’s budget allocated
to the formal program of instruc-
tion over the objections of a ma-
jority of the University faculty.”

Other amendments include in-
creasing student membership on
the Faculty Committees on Aca-
demic Policy and~ Resources to
6 out of 18, on the Senate Com-
mittee on General Policy and Re-
sources to 5 out of 16, and addition
of two more students to the Com-
mittee on information Resources.

The Associate Secretary of the
Senate and a member of the ABS
elected by student members of the
Senate should be added to the Com-
mittee of Arbitration.

Another amendment is the ad-
dition of “intercollegiate athletics”
to “student organizations’ on the
outline of the duties of the Com-
mittee on Student Life.

“These amendments should give
the faculty some indication of
where the students stand. These
are just suggested amendments.
The ABS is not committed,” said
Pais. He described the document,
“gs it stands, a wishy-washy Sen-
ate proposal.”

Clinic

Although the pregnancy clinic is
in operation, Tuesday and Thurs-
day nights from 9 p.m, to 11 p.m.
Dr. Fairweather will not always be

serve on the Traffic Committee,
which determines the policy and
regulation of student and faculty
vehicles

Two students are needed to serve
on the Freshman Advisor Com-
mittee of the College of Arts and
Sciences, whose immediate concern
is the Freshman Advisor seminars.
These seminars are designed to
offer freshmen an introduction to
University study and an acquaint-
ance of faculty through a proposed
inter-departmental full credit
course.

Four students (freshmen ar in-
eligible) are needed to serve on
the new University Committee on
Student Conduct. This committee

bility to adjudiciate student viola-
tions of University conduct reg-
ulations.”

‘The Alchemist’

(Continued from Page 1)
the entrance of each new client,
the three accomplices adopt dif-
ferent roles.

For instance, the alchemist be-
comes a doctor for one client and
a priest for the next. Likewise,
Doll Commons changes to a lady or
a fairyqueen, while Face’s roles
include those of a doctor and a cap-
tain.

The audience should look for a
“small power struggle among the
three accomplices,’ says Snoozy
White. ‘‘Although Subtle the al-
chemist is the figurehead of the
eroup, actually Face is in control.”

The Elizabethan language of the
play is another important feature
Verbose and non-poetic, the lan-
guage offers quite a challenge to
the actors, who must make it come

ross natural.

“Yet,” according to Snoozy White,
“the play is not hard to understand.
It is not that dependent on every
word being heard. I think that the
play will speak for itself, and that
people will be caught up in its
spirit.”

Other things to look for in the
play are stage business, especially
entrances and exits, and surprise
discoveries.

As expressed by one member of
the cast, “If our production works,
it can be a funny and entertaining
evening at the theatre. I don’t
mean entertaining in the sense of
an evening on Broadway, though;
this is a different kind of comedy

than most are used to seeing. It is |
the audience is |

important that
aware of the nature of the play.”

Faculty Votes

(Continued from Page 1)
should not be heard or weighed,
put that Faculty is central.”

“The students are not being ex-
cluded from consideration. They
still have a role, but it is much
more limited. Before the Senate
was making decisions Now the
Faculty would be making decis-
ions from a committee with stu-
dents on it.”

“Many faculty members are not
willing to grant that the student
should have the right to any more
than consultation It’s conflicting
educational philosophies that are
at stake here.”

Professor Peeler noted two un-
solved problems in the current pro-
posal. As now structured, when the
Senate disagrees with the Faculty
or ABS, the issue is referred to an
Arbitration Committee consisting
of the Provost, The Secretary of
the Faculty, and Secretary of the
Senate, also a Faculty member.
It is felt by the revising committee
that none of these people are highly
political and are therefore qualified
to handle a case impartially

However, there is
lack of students on the Arbitra-
tion Committee, which may be con-
tested in the event of a disagree-
ment between Senate and ABS. Ad-
ding only one student to the com-
mittee would result in an even
number and possible deadlock.

The second problem inv olves the
relationship between ABS and the
Senate’s Committee on Student life.
The Committee is to handle aff af-
fairs not directly related to aca-

demic policy. The question is then:
Where does this leave the ABS?

The ABS is currently working on
these and other problems or ob-
jections to the document to find an
acceptable solution

In reference to the document’s
possibility of pa g, Professor
Peeler speculated, Both wings, the
right and tht left, will be split; sup-
port will come from both, The suc-
cess of the document obviously de-
pends on how many we get from
each. The administration 1s satis-
fied finally, and this should help

fy some of the conservativt

members.”

Penn State Overpowers
Reynolds’ Pitchmen, 3-1

By BOB WENDEL
“Mentally, we were never ‘n
this ball game.’’ Such was the com-
ment of a thoroughly disgusted
Coach Craig Reynolds, as B.U. lost
to Penn State 3-1.
This marks the first loss a Rey-

Bison letterman Steve Gentino re-
turned to the lineup last week.

nolds soccer team has suffered
since dropping their first contest
h West Chester last year. This

sns their two year totals to

12-2-3, with Rider scheduled for
Saturday.

Commenting on the play of the
team against the Nittany Lions
Reynolds stated, “‘We were sloppy,
our heading was poor, our tackles
were half-hearted, and our pass-
ing was inaccurate.”

This was a difficult loss to take,
after having played extremely well
against Colgate and only managing
to tie, but it will make the game
Saturday even more difficult.

“I hope the boys can bounce
back. The game against Rider is
our first conference game, and they
are not going to be pushovers in
the least. This is a MUST game for
us.”

The two bright spots of the day
were fullbacks Mike Novack and
Larry Greenwood. Mike Novak,
was especially spectacular. ‘“‘He’s
the calmest, most aggressive fresh-
men fullback I’ve ever seen. With-
out his effort, the score could easily
have been 8-1.”

The story of the game can be
seen by examining the statistics.
State had 47 shots to the Bisons
nine.

“Penn State had full control of
the center of the field, which kept
us constantly on our heels. We
were not agressive, and instead of
using our wings, we consistently
tried to penetrate the middle.”

Bisonettes Trounce
Tough Nittany Lions

By STEPH LAUDENBACH

The Bisonettes won their second
game Wednesday defeating Penn
State 1-0 at Penn State.

Most of the excitement of the
game came in the second half. End-
ing the first half with a 0-0 score,
the Bisonettes decided to shift their |
line. Co-captain Sue Gant shifted |
from fullback to left inner and
scored the only goal of the game
about eight minutes into the half.

All the girls played a good game, |
but special mention belongs to
center halfback, Marge Deck, and |
Lisa Edgell, goalkeeper, who made |
thirteen recoveries. |

From watching the game from

the whole team seemingly didn’t
want to play soccer on Wednesday,

do was go out on the field to win.

The Citadel Hosts Herd;
Injuries Hamper Bisons

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

The Citadel Bulldogs will be the
Thundering Herd’s toughest oppo-
nent so far this season. Injuries
sustained in last week’s game
against Davidson may cost the
Bison’s the services of Jim Cassidy
and Paul Gilewicz as they are both
listed as doubtful starters.

Cassidy has a knee injury and
Gilewicz a sprained ankle. And so
far this week, neither have been
able to practice.

Tony Moretz and Don Giacomelli
both had minor ailments but they
are counted on to start in their
usual positions.

Players of the Week

Art Wilkins

Three BU players are recipients
of the player of the week awards
for outstanding play in the Bison’s
21-20 victory over Davidson. Coach
Fred Prender said, ‘‘We honestly
could have given the awards to the
entire team beceuse there were so
many exceptional pertormantes,
but we felt that Art Wilkins and
Bob Rohrbaugh on offense, and
Gene Depew on defense should get
this week’s honors.”

Wilkins, a junior from Mount
Vernon, N.Y., has been a starter
at guard all season

and tremendous determination, He
has been a consistent performer for
the Herd this season.

Rohrbaugh, the Bisons’ gigantic
offensive tackle, had his best game
of the season. The 6-3, 245-pound
senior who was All-Conference and
All-State last year started the 1970
campaign slowly, but has come on
strong in the past two games.

His best game on Saturday was
witnessed by a Cincinnati Bengal’s
scout.

Depew is one of the Orange and
Blue co-captains. The Mifflintown
senior has played consistent ball all
season, but had his best game on
Saturday. The 6-1, 220-pounder was
credited with nine tackles and real-
ly put the pressure on the David-
son quarterback in the Wildcats’
last series with the ball.

FRIDAY, SATURDAY

On the good side for the Bison’s
is the return of Tarras Onischenko
and Mitch Farbstein, both of whom
will be available for spot duty
against the Bulldogs.

If there was one game for the
defensive backfield to be hurting
this is the one since the Citadel is
a running team. Tony Lucadamo,
Gene Luccarelli, and John Ondra-
sik are ready to work as a unit if
the services of Cassidy and Gile-
wicz aren’t available.

The Citadel is now 2-3 on the
season but they have posted a per-
fect 2-0 record in the Southern
Conference and are the league’s
favorite to win it all. The Bulldogs
have trounced East Carolina 31-0
and William and Mary 16-7 while
ending up on the short end against
Clemson, Vanderbilt, and Arkansas
State.

The Cadets are a fine running
team and a strong option play.
Tailback Bob Duncan has averaged
over 6.2 yards a carry in 69 at-
tempts while 6-22 fullback Ben Cha-
vis is the team’s power runner pick-
ing up over 200 yards on the ground
so far this year.

The backs run behind an ex-
perienced line that averages 214
pounds while the defensive line has
shown exceptional quickness and
aggressiveness. Left defensive
tackle, Norm Seabrooks is a big
(6-1, 238) lineman that has drawn
praises from many coaches.

The Bulldog defensive backfield
is an excellent combination, with
sophomore Jeff Varnadow a stand-
out in last week’s game against
William and Mary, as he inter-
cepted three passes and returned
two af them a 100 yards and 46
yards for the winning touchdowns.

John Rosa is Citadel’s quarter-
back but he hasn’t shown any stat-
istics approaching Howie Burke’s
35 completions in 73 attempts for
401 yards and 4 TD’s in three
games. Art Wilkins, Bob Rohr-
baugh, and Gene Depew were also
named as standouts in last week’s
game against Davidson by Head
Coach Prender and he hopes that
they will be able to continue their
outstanding play.

The Big Blue will need another
balanced effort this week in order
to overcome the Bulldogs.

Watts:

By JENNY CHEN

After deliberation since last
April, the faculty finally voted to
accept the Senate proposal 84-27
last night with a thankful. “Praise
God!” and a “‘very pleased”’ utter-
ed by President Charles Watts as
the special faculty meeting stood
adjourned.

The Senate matter now will be
considered by the ABS. After a
conference committee resolves dif-
ferences between what the ABS
passes and the faculty passed, the
document will be subject to a cam-
pus-wide referrendum.

Although the ABS will be basical-
ly discussing the student role in the
Proposal for a University Senate
and Proposal for Reorganization of
Faculty Committees, President
Watts commented that, ‘‘If the ABS
wants to make comments about the
faculty reorganization, they may do
se.”

However, President Watts stres-

sed that a distinction must be
made when commenting on the Sen-
ate and faculty parts of the pro-
posal.

After the meeting, Professor
Ralph Spielman commented, “The
students ought to see the document
and to debate with the faculty. I
draw attention to this need”’ He
said he would be willing to spend
time with the students to explain
the document.

Last night, three motions were
presented before the faculty came
to the final ratification vote. Three
amendments were passed and one
nine-amendment package was
tabled.

The description of faculty com-
mittee No. 6 which ‘“‘will conduct
a continuing review of the commit-
tee system of the Faculty and re-
view the operation of the Senate
at least every two years” was
amended. Faculty vote also al-
lowed the words “in consultation

Retired Professor
Succumbs Friday

Dr. Norman H. Stewart, 85, pro-
fessor of zoology emeritus at the
University, died Friday afternoon
jn the Evangelical Community Hos-
pital, Lewisburg, after a short ill-
ness.

A native of Hamilton, Ontario,
Canada, Professor Stewart retired
in 1959 after 45 years on the faculty.
In 1926 he served as the third presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania Academy
of Science of which he was a mem-
ber.

Recipient of a bachelor of arts
degree from the University of Ro-
chester in 1908, Dr. Stewart served
two years as an instructor in z0-
ology at the University of Michigan
and earned a master of arts degree
there in 1910, the same year he
joined the faculty here.

with the Senate Committee on Com-
mittees” to be added.

A restriction of committee mem-
bership to those holding rank of
Associate Professor or Professor
was eliminated on the Committee
on Academic Freedom and Tenure.

The committee will be comprised

N.Y. Times — Mental Health, dropout and surgical rates of stu-
dents have remained the same despite increasing student activism.
Dr, Dana Farnsworth, a Harvard psychiatrist, notes that mental
disorders “originate in the home and in relation with other sig-
nificant persons in the student’s early life rather than in conditions
encountered in college.” He comments that the term “mentally ill”
is not suitable; that it “‘might be argued convincingly that the nature
of their dissatisfaction connotes a higher than usual level of mental
health, particularly in the realm of concern for others.”

(FCNS) - Listing legal action, education and petitions, Ronald
F. Docksai, National Secretary of Young Americans for Freedom,
announced a program to show majority support on campuses
against “radical extremists who seek to destroy education.”’ YAF,
founded at William F. Buckley’s home in 1960, has an active follow-
ing for conservative causes, boasting more than 60 members of
Congress on its National Advisory Board. The group has doubled

its size in the last two years to 55,000 members in 500 chapters.

Sebastian and Buddy Miles

Perform in

By BILL WHITNEY

John B. Sebastian and Buddy
Miles will perform in concert here
on S$ y, October 31 at 8:30

i Gym.

John Sebastian, considered by
many a folk-rock mus origi-
nated as a prominent musician as
the main writer and a singer for
the Locin’ Sponfud, where he
wrote his first published song, “Do
You Believe in Magic.”

His first hit was followed by
“You Didn’t Have to Be So Nice.”
“Daydreams,” “Summer in the

Jashville Cats,” “Younger
Girl,” ‘‘ Didn’t Have to Do It” and
“Did You Ever Have to Make Up
Your Mind?” By the spring of 1969,
Sebastian had an even 100 published
songs to his credit.

The style of the Spoonful was
Sebastian’s, a blend of nearly
everything American — from jug
band to blues to country and folk
with Sousa and minstrel season-
ing. In 1966, Cash Box and Bill-
board each voted the ensemble the
top U.S. group of the year.

A year later, the Lovin’ Spoonful
began to break up. By 1968, Se-
bastian felt it was time to go on
to other things, mainly concentrat-
ing on writing. During that year he
wrote his first Broadway show,
“Jimmy Shine,” starring Dustin
Hoffman.

In addition to performing at
many colleges throughout the past
year, Sebastian appeared at the
Woodstock music festival in August
of 1969, where he performed “I
Had a Dream” and “Rainbows All
Over Your Blues.”

Buddy Miles, billed as an “extra
added attraction,’ does acid-rock
music.

He has recently formed his own
group, which he will be bringing
here. He and the group have cut an
album, entitled ‘“Them Changes.”
Recently they released a single,
called “Dreams,”’ which has been
doing very well. Both records ap-

CA Conducts Nature
Walk with Gibbons

The C.A. Cowan Weekends, a
time and place to relax (or relax)
and to do just about whatever you
want, will resume its yearly
schedule Saturday, October 31,
through Sunday morning, Novem-
ber 1.

This appears to be the only avail-
able date this semester, so the C.A.
has attempted to compensate for
the occurrence of the John Sebas-
tian concert that Saturday night by
inviting .Euell Gibbons.

He will conduct a woods-walk in
the afternoon, and will direct the
gathering, cleaning, and cooking of
area-gathered edibles to be part of
the supper meal. Hopefully, the
Outward Bound film that didn’t
arrive in time for colloquy will be
available, in addition to some films
of Euell Gibbons.

Due to the logistics of gathering
enough of Nature’s bounty to pro-
vide one dish, the list of “goers”
will be on a first-come, first-served
basis.

To cover the cost of food, a $2.00
fee must be charged, as the Cowan
budget was cut.

Applications and information may
be obtained at the C.A. office,

Action and Priorities

The decision of the ABS that would
allow students to take off one week to
work in campaigns of Congressional can-
didates is one which can not and must
not be regarded lightly in its consequen-
ces, The principles that it implies are
many more than just the ones involved
in the Princeton Plan. If we study the
decision we will find that it involves the
whole concept of the university, the stu-
dent in society, the society and the stu-
dent, and the university’s role in society.

The ABS and the faculty (suppose)
decide to let students obtain incompletes,
if necessary, in order to work in an elec-
tion. OK. This in turn brings up the
question: why has the University sanc-
tioned one form of political work and not

The question of whether or not the
faculty should ratify the ABS proposal,
per se has no meaning. But in the con-
text of a new purpose, a new ideal, a new
reality, a new freedom, it could be the

The Editorial Board is collecting in-
formation concerning the work of the in-
firmary; anyone with factual reports or

stories please send them to

ly, a large number of those inter-
ests and the needs are shared by
anyone at this school, whether they
be male or female.

Organizations are present which
owe their existence to a specific
group of people who have come to-
gether to satisfy certain needs and
desires, and function accordingly.
No one would like to think that
their individual interests must be
subordinate to and represented by
the whole at all times.

AWS therefore exists to provide
opportunities for individuals of
this campus which would not be
met by a co-ed, campus wide or-
ganization. The fact that those men,
criticizing AWS, cannot recognize
that women have interests which
do vary from those of men illus-
trates this only too well

AWS does not “‘stand as an an-
achronism toward the recent
movements toward streamlining
campus government and uniting the
campus into a community.” We
would indeed stand as an anachron-
ism if we refused to change. It must
again be stated that our emphasis
has shifted from governing to pro-
gramming. The editorial itself ac-
knowledged this.

We would stand as an anachron-
ism if we had not acknowledged
the necessity of changing women’s
hours. The Bucknellian is not the
only group capable of observing the
“absurdity of women’s hours.”

In reference to freshman women,
we will retain control of their first-
semester hours as long as we feel
that hours provide a framework for
this period of adjustment. We are
here to listen to any argument for
or against such a provision. It is
the option of freshman women to
bring their views to us. Such action
would result in a reconsideration
and possible change.

With regards to the Bucknellian’s
statement that they “feel that it
should be the right of dorm coun-
cils, and not the moralistic AWS,
to set dorm visitation policies for
their own residence halls.” - we
would like to inform the Bucknell
community that it is presently the
right of dorm councils to set their
own visitation policies within the
limits set by the University - not
AWS.

It should further be known that
the women students will have an
opportunity to vote on the existence
of AWS on campus - but this will
not be by means of an ABS refer-
endum.

AWS has recognized the need for
meaningful change and has adapted
accordingly. We have undergone an
extensive exploration of possibili-
ties which has resulted in the set-
ting of a new direction, whose po-
tential should not be disparaged by
those unwilling to objectively con-
sider its possibilities.

FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK

Committee of 4 & 1

By PAUL OSHER

In view of the fact that mid-terms are flying fast and furious
this month, I thought that I might offer my thoughts in regard to
the current deliberations of the Faculty on the issue of campus
governance in the form ofa public evaluation of some of the names
in the news. Consider this a Mid-Term Report to the Students on the
behavior of various faculty personalities.

My comments are not intended as public ridicule of these people,
but rather as additional information by which the students can gain
insight into the workings of University politics. I in no way intend
that my remarks be considered the last word. These notes are my
observations culled over the last few semesters from personal ex-
periences with these men and from scrutiny of thir actions in public
forums like Faculty meetings.

The Committee of Four

Ralph Spielman is a sensitive human being. Ralph is generally
for the same goals as American youth though he often disagrees
with the reasons advanced by the radical rhetoricians. He thinks
the War is “despicable” as are the boobs running the U.S. govern-
ment, but he feels that the only way to rectify the mammoth prob-
lems confronting the world now is for knowledgeable people to get
a hold of the decision making machinery by non-violent methods.
That is to say that he dislikes the Weathermen, the Panthers and
other “revolutionary” groups that pander on about ‘Power to the
People.” Surrounded by contemporaries who do not share his dis-
tress at American society, he sees a potent force for social change
in the youth of today. But he maintains an aristocratic attitude to-
ward students because of their lack of expertise and knowledge,
and their dislike of hard work to accomplish their objectives. Ralph
probably likes the idea of a University governing body that could
stimulate the University to exercise its influence on the course of
societal affairs.

Ed Staiano has ambitious dreams for the computerization of the
University. He is a technologist who has had considerable success
at moving the University into the world of the Third Generation
computer. One of his major problems is his condescending attitude
towards students. Ed has influenced the course of Bucknell’s future
considerably, but seems to view student participation in areas that
would affect his activities as a threat. He sees the institution of a
new University governing body that delegates too much power to
students as a threat to the traditional rights of the Faculty.

John Peeler would probably like to involve students in the gov-
ernance of the University as much as possible because of his con-
fidence in their abilities to reorient the society toward more human-
istic goals. John values the student perspective on almost any issue
and often finds himself working for the same goals.

Rauph Walker is aware of the needs and goals of students in
general. Ralph supports the American system and thinks that it
can be made to work for those who put in the time and effort. He
perceives the student feeling inadequate and effete when controlled
with the enormous problems and complexities of our society. The
scientific approach of problem analysis and solution is his answer
to the issues that confront us. Ralph ees that increased student
participation in the governance of the University is advisable on a
limited scale, but he prefers that the Faculty retain some control
over the more important aspects of running the University.

Charles Watts has an incredibly difficult job. Nevertheless he
cannot be excused from critical evaluation as regards student in-
terests. Char has brought some imaginative changes into ex-
istence in his last six years as President. He has been open and
aboveboard about his activities, and it would seem that his casual
attitude has filtered down to his subordinates in the administration
who do an admiriable job of maintaining honest and frank relations
with the students. His interest in a new University governance
would seem to derive primarily from his desire to avoid any of the
problems that appear to be cropping up on other campuses around
the country. It is Charles’ conviction that involving students in the
operations of the University is healthy and preferable, although he
does seem to harbor st tendencies in his relations with students
(perhaps a carry-over from his days as a faculty member). The po-
tential difficulties that the University students might present seem
much more real and imminent to him than they do to many faculty
members. One might conjecture that a good old student riot in con-
nection with his proposing a new governance system might increase
his credibility with those faculty. Being in the driver’s seat, he has
great confidence in his ability to persuade (?) members of the Uni-
versity to look at all the ramifications of their actions.

On the morning of September 6, files from Local Boards 73-76

If you were registered at these draft boards, you should be in-
formed of your draft rights and the implications of this event for
you.

Your draft board has been greatly slowed down in its process-
ing of people for induction. Any notices you receive from them may
be illegal. Therefore, it would be to your advantage to contact a

Cases

“The “Policy on Academic Res-

states that: “The Board of Review
will prepare a report, omitting
names, which will specify the num-
ber of each kind of case reviewed
and present a summary of the pen-
alties assessed. This report will be
published in the BUCKNELLIAN.”

During the year 1969-1970 the
Board reviewed 6 cases of alleged
academic dishonesty, all of which
were associated with a specific
course in which the student was
enrolled. The charges were sus-
tained in all cases, with recom-
mended penalties being, respecti-
vely, F on the paper (i), F on
laboratory component of the course
(1), and F in the course (4).

Action on several cases which
occurred at the end of the year
was deferred until 1970-1971.

BU Overpowers Rider;

“We got off to a very slow start,
but when we scored during the
third quarter, we were revitalized,”

nolds concerning his team’s 4-1 win
over Rider.

He continued, “Rider had better
personel than I thought; the boys
also played very defensively, and
after what happened at Penn State,
I think the guys were a little afraid
of themselves.’”

However, judging from what hap-
pened throughout the game, the
team eventually did come around.

The first score came on a play in
which Jim Davenport shot down the
left side with the ball, and at the
end line, he passed the ball back
into the center of the goal-mouth,
where Phil Campbell drilled it into
the net.

The half ended with a 1-0 score,
but from the very even play, the
game would obviously hinge on the
second half, and it did.

As the second half began B.U
was easily in control. The second
Bison score came when Glenn Mars
chipped the ball down the left side
to Davenport, who once again
crossed the ball back into the
center, and the shot by Rich Col-
lins was good

JV Booters Trounce Bullets, 3-0;
Frosh Gridders Beat Bloomsburg

By DAVE COULTER

The Bison ‘“‘B’” soccer team reg-
istered its second win of the year
Friday, shutting out host Gettys-
burg 3-0.

In spite of a strong wind which
favored the windward squad each
quarter, the BU defense was sel-
dom penetrated throughout the
game

Playing a tight 4-2-4 formation the
Bisons controlled the ball in Get-
tysburg’s half of the field and pep-
pered the opposition net with shots.

Meanwhile, the Bison goalie had
comparatively little work to do as
the team was never in serious
trouble

Bill Byrne opened the scoring in
the second quarter with a penalty
kick. Jim Hindel tallied another
score in the second half as did
Byrne, driving in his second goal
of the day.

The B-team this year is designed

1 team was made to best uti-

In this way promising freshmen

This year, however, the B-team is
manned almost exclusively by

team playing a scheduled game for
the f time because of conflict-

EXPANSION

Later in the same quarter the
ball was lofted about 20 feet
straight up by Collins, and after
bouncing three times Joe Stein-
met drilled the ball into the net.

Changing directions for the last
quarter, B.U. continued to control,
and Collins deflected the ball off a
Bronco fullback and into the goal.

Rider’s only score came late in
the quarter as a Bronco lineman
brought the ball down the right
side, and shot across into the left
corner of the net.

In commenting on the Rider of-
fense, Reynolds noted that although
they took almost as many shots as
B.U., most of them were from 20
yards or more.

Concerning the game this Satur-
day with Gettysburg, the Bullets
are currently 0-3, and since Rey-
nolds B squad was victorious over
Gettysburg’s junior varsity 3-0, it
would seem that the crowd at the
Parents’ Weekend game will see a
good deal of offensive soccer.

The Baby Bisons staged a re-

Slaughtered 51-6 by Cornell on Oc-

The Bisons’ points came on five

Bulldogs Round Up Herd;
Bisons Meet Leopards Next

By DAN MILLER

The Bisons were repulsed in their
assault on The Citadel Saturday in
the old Southern town of Charles-
ton, South Carolina. When the fire-
works were over, the Bulldogs had
handed the Herd a 42-28 defeat.

The Bison defense prevented the
Citadel from establishing their
powerful running game but Coach
Fred Prender pointed out that “‘the
Citadel counted on making the big
play to win.”

The Citadel capitalized on Bison
fumbles and took advantage of
good field position on several oc-
easions to set up touchdowns.

Opening the first quarter, the
Cadets marched from their 25 yard
line to the 24 of BU in 15 plays be-
fore the Bisons stiffened to meet
the charge.

The Citadel was forced to settle
for a 34 yard field goal.

The Bisons picked up their only
first half score when Tony Luca-
damo recovered a fumble on the
Bulldog 27. Howie Burke engine-
ered a touchdown in four plays cap-
ped by a pass to Greg Wright for
the score.

At the end of the first quarter

the Bisons were ahead 7-3.

The rest of the half was dismal
as far as the Bisons’ cause was con-
cerned.

Gene Luccarelli, playing his first
game under lights, dropped a punt
on the BU 35 that the Bulldogs
promptly turned into a TD.

After an exchange of punts, The
Bulldogs found themselves at mid-
field and scored again on a 54 yard
pass play.

Another BU fumble led to the
Cadets’ third score and 27-7 half
time lead.

The second halt featured the
same type football with the Herd
maintaining long scoring drives
and the Citadel unable to establish
a running game but scoring on
long pass plays.

The tallies for the Herd were by
Rich Diez on a 2 yard run, Jay
Griffin scored on a 22 yard end
around play and Greg Doviak tos-
sed a 16 yard TD pass to Bob Ciper-
son with 1 second left in the game.

Coach Prender acknowledges that
both the coaches and the players
were disappointed by the loss, but
they are convinced that the Bull-
dogs “know they were in a foot-
ball game.”’

Prender said it was the first time
that most of the team had been ex-
posed to power football the way it
is played in many Southern Con-
ference schools. ‘The crowd shows
a lot of enthusiasm for the team.”
The Cadets spiritedly fired off a
monstrous cannon and played Dixie
after every Bulldog score.

Once the game had to be stopped |
to quiet the Cadets so Burke could |

call the offensive signals. As the
Herd was warming up before the
game, the cadets were marched
past with eyes left, while they
hissed at the Bisons.

Prender asserted that while he
“would not like to play constantly
in that type of atmosphere perhaps
it is a good idea to experience it
once in a while to keep your per-
spective.”

The Cadets of Citadel were over-
joyed by the victory and by the
fact that their leaves were extended
to 2:00 a.m. te commemorate the
win.

Next year in the second game of
the series, The Citadel will come to
Lewisburg.

The Bison’s record in now 2-3
with five games remaining. This
Saturday they will meet the Lafay-
ette leopards in Memorial Stadium
in front of a Parents’ Weekend
crowd

The Leopards have played good
football against Delaware and Rut-
gers and Coach Prender expects
an exciting game.

The other TD came on a long
punt return by Stan Page. The of-
fensive blocking was good enough
to make possible a total yard gain-
age of 230.

Defensively, the improvement |
was even more astounding, as wit- |

Frame of Reference Explored
ABS Commences Senate Debate

News Analysis

By ERIC RIESS
The ABS has begun considera-
tion of the University Senate which
was passed by the faculty Monday.
Wednesday night, at the first of
what would appear to be a long
series of debates on the document,
Dave Lacy, ABS president, led a
discussion which outlined many of
the ‘hidden’ problems which the
students must consider before they
even begin to amend the proposal.
The most important of these con-
siderations is, as he said, “the con-
text in which the ABS is going to
consider the document.” He con-
tinued, “Are we going to try and

Freshmen Request
Abolition of Hours

By GINA SMITH

Freshman women presently are
circulating petitions calling for the
freshman women’s
hours. The signed petitions will be
presented to the AWS, which has
the power to revoke curfew

AWS President Stuie Oliver feels
that this motion can be considered
seriously after the freshman wo-
men have thoroughly looked into
the question.

She notes, however,
is really busy now. Adoption of
this measure would be pending
discussion. I think it has a chance
for success, but, of course, I can
give no definite answer right now.”

Andrea Van Horn, president of
Harris Hall and unofficial organ-
izer of this effort, plans to present
the signed petitions at an AWS
meeting. She hopes that “as many
freshman women as possible’’ will
accompany her, so that all views
of the proposal can be expressed.

These petitions are the result of
several meetings, organized inde-
pendently of the freshman house
councils. At the most recent meet-

IFC, ran the meeting in which KDR
Bob McCormick, president of the
IFC ran the meeting in which KDR
was the only dissenting house on
the party issue.

The question of whether or not
to permit independents to attend
parties has been an issue of great-
er controversy the past two-three
years. Individually, Phi Psi, TKE
and DU had already decided to
foreclose the privilege once of-
lered independents, and with the
passage of the proposal, all IFC
members have now adopted the
policy of exclusion.

Though enforcement of the re-
solution ‘“‘will be the responsibility
of the individual fraternities,” the
concensus was that ‘‘bouncers”
would be initiated to control traf-
fic into the houses during parties.

To facilitate this process, IFC
identification cards will soon be
issued to all registered fraternity
members, and admiitance to all
parties will demand the presenta-
tion of the card. Guests will be
issued special stamps to show au-
thorization.

Primary reasons for the proposal
of the document were embodied
in the proposal.

1. to effectively
campus personnel from fra-
ternity parties in adherance
to the requests of the Pen-
nsylvania Liquor Control
Board.

. to decrease the cost of re-
freshments served at fratern-
ity parties to non-members.

3. to make the exclusion of fresh-

eliminate off

men at parties during the rush
program possible and enforce-
able.

- to restore the social advantage
back to the fraternities by nar-
rowing participation in fra-
ternity functions to those who
have economically supported
them.

Also in a subsequent vote, the
members decided to extend rush
functions through this weekend

that the faculty will approve or are
we going to pass a document which
we think is best for the University
as a whole?”

To some, there would not appear
to be any difference in the two pos-
sibilities outlined by Lacy, but to
many more students Lacy is re-
flecting the thinking behind the
nine amendments brought up and
consequently tabled by the faculty
Monday.

These amendments hit at what
the October 16 editorial in The
Bucknellian called, “the distinct
feeling that the faculty is trying to
minimize student participation in
the governing of the University.”

The ‘token’ membership which
students enjoy on many faculty
committees as well as the feeling
of under-representation on the most
important committee in the Senate,
the committee on general policy
and resources, appear to give cre-
dence to this claim.

The ABS is faced with the pro-
blem of either changing this situa-
tion to something which they feel
is more adequate or leaving the
proposal as is, knowing that the
faculty would have changed the
student membership if they had
wanted to

In either case the final decision
will rest with the conference com-
mittee which will try and resolve
differences between the faculty
version and that of the ABS

Concern was expressed by some
students that “even in the con-
ference committee the students po-
sition will be untenable because we

New Dorm Residents
Favor Longer Hours

By LINDA DIETRICK

Roughly 90 percent of New Dorm
residents want extended visitation
hours for their living unit, accord-
ing to results of last week’s com-
prehensive questionaire

A majority also favor keeping
both inside and front doors un-
locked at all times, and relaxing
accompaniment requirements for
visitors of the opposite sex.

“We are very pleased to have re-
ceived a 100 percent return on the
questinoaires,”” said Gary Raynor,

Opposes Combat in Vietnam

Resigned Officer Criticizes War Crime Policy

By LINDA ANNE CAPUTO

A lecture on ‘Military Virtue and
Pentagon War Crime Policy” will
be deliverel by Captain Robert
Johnson Tuesday, at 8:00 p.m in
101-B Coleman.

This lecture is being sponsored

by the Political Science Depart-
..ment.
* Captain Johnson, a 1965 graduate
of West Point, was an officer in
the U.S. infantry and served with
the Military Assistance Command
in Vietnam.

While in Vietnam, he resigned
his commission as a means of pro-
test and then returned to the States
to promote anti-war policies.

Presently, Captain Johnson is in-
volved in three anti-war organ-
izations. He is vice-president of the
State of Maryland Veterans for
Peace which consists of Vietnam
veterans, as well as other vet-

erans.

He is also the co-ordinator of
the Concerned Military Academy
Graduates Against the War in Viet-
nam. And the acting East co-
ordinator for the National Com-
mittee for the Citizens’ Commis-
sion of Inquiry on United States
War Crimes in Vietnam.

This committee will hold a hear-
ing in Detroit on December 1-3 at
which over one hundred Vietnam
veterans will discuss war crimes.

It is the contention of this group,
supported by Captain Johnson, that
war crimes are not matters of
chance happenings but that they
are matters of policy “extending
to the highest level of civilian and
military leadership in the United
States.”

Several Vietnam witnesses will
be present an Windsor, Canada to
testify at this meeting. Internation-

al lawyers of reputation, includ-
ing Professor Richard Falk from
Princeton Law School, will attend
this assembly.

Prior to his scheduled public
lecture, Captain Johnson will be on
campus to conduct private class
discussions on the issue of compara-
tive military and civilian relations.

According to Professor Gene
Chenoweth, chairman of the Po-
litical Science Department, a de-
bate between Captain Johnson and
a ROTC representative was pro-
posed as a means to expose two
different points of view on this
military issue. However, this pro-
posal was rejected on the grounds
that military values are not po-
litical values.

Still, it is Professor Chenoweth’s
desire that a discussion will fol-
low the lecture in which various
opinions will be voiced.

A. Judy will draw up one primary
and two or three ‘‘contingency”’
proposals for the approval of resi-
dents.

The propos: will be presented
for examination and discussion at
an open Council meeting Monday,
November 2, at 7:30 p.m., in New
Dorm formal living room.

“The proposals must investigate

tion and the students don’t seem to
have anything to give in this case.”

One other general area where
students expressed concern was the
recommendatory nature of the pro-
posals passed by the Senate.

In the words of Robert Wendel,
“The only power which the Senate
has is to review and recommend,
but in most cases the document
doesn’t say to whom it recom-
mends. It would be much better if
it were clearer, to whom the Sen-
ates’ recommendations were g0-
ing.”

John Dunlop, dean of student af-
fairs pointed out, that, “If is the re-
sponsibility of each of the present
governing groups on campus to pay
attention to the actions of the Sen-
ate and take action on the ones that
affected them.”

The specific problem of the im-
plementation of Senate decisions
by members of the administration
was also brought up.

Concern was expressed that the
Senate did not have enough power
to enforce their decisions if a mem-
ber of the administration was op-

Editor’s Note: The Riverside
Community offered some of their
impressions of the University in
their newsletter.

RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY was
invited to send some people down
fo Bucknell University for the week-
end of September . (Colloquy).
Rick Beardsly, of Bucknell and
Riverside, had set up lectures and
demonstrations in a variety of
areas.

Some of our observations were:
Bucknell is a very conservative
school and pretty well out of the
main stream of current events ...
from world affairs to campus agita-
tions; even though the students we
spoke with had already had some
experience with sensitivity train-
ing they were pretty much out of
touch with their feelings and be-
ing a high scholastic level made
head-talk easier and more impres-
sive; there is less variety of ec-
nomic backgrounds there and the
students in general seemed very
sure about what direction they
wanted to take with their lives;
they seemed less aware of the other
kinds of people that they might con-
tact at a big city school; the stu-
dents were very friendly, nice and
pleasant to us.

We all felt some frustration about
not being able to help them get in
touch with their feelings (and, in
some cases, not being able to ad-
mit that they had any feelings at
all.) The difficulty of working in
such a limited time period didn’t
help, either.

it was a university requirement rather

The simplest and quickest way to
eliminate this confining requirement is

for those students who do not wish to at-

HE JAUNDICED EYE

Vanishing Minorities

By KENNETH DOWST

MEMO TO: The Hon. Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States.
FROM: The President's Commission on Vanishing Minorities.

Dear Mr. President:

We realize that, generally, Presidents’ Commissions are held rather
low in your esteem; that the reports of the Kerner Commission, the
Walker Commission, the Eisenhower Commission, the Scranton Com-
mission, the Obscenity Commission, and, most recently, the Civil Rights
Commission, have met hardly the warmest reception from your office.
Nevertheless, we decided not to quit while we were ahead (ie., before

Spiro discovers us) because, frankly,

we enjoy our salaries and expense

accounts. It is fortunate that we did not quit, for we have made a dis-
covery which may be of interest to you.

At present time, we have concluded only a small part of our an-
thropogical research - we have not even finished with the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, the first state on our agenda. However, we wanted to
share with you a surprising observation we have made

Contrary to popular opinion, the American nigger is far from extinct!

No, this is not a hoax. I have seen them with my own eyes (and

thanked Gol for the sight)

- a whole colony of them! Of course, most of

them (unlike the original niggers) seem to be of the Caucasian race. But
what the hell; a nigger’s a nigger, no matter what color his skin is - right?

We thought it was a practical joke at first, so we lived among them
and studied every detail of their lives: We put on brassieres and hair
curlers with them; we remained silent in class with them; we purged our
minds of all deep philosophical thoughts with them.

We went to cocktail parties with them, and later bragged of the num-
ber of whiskey sours we had consumed; we went to sorority teas with
them, and even worried if we would get a bid from Kappa, or would have
to settle for DZ. We bragged of our virginity (and perhaps stretched the

(Continued on Page 3)

Personally, I got anxious at being
surrounded by a large group of
people . . . all close in ages and
activities . . . not exposed to the
conflicts of everyday life . . . con-
tinuing in this isolated way all
through 4 years at college and com-
ing out educated but not aware of
themselves or their feelings. When
I tried to picture the way River-
side’s teenagers would get along at
Bucknell I was even more uneasy.
I was also afraid of the idea of go-
ing in there and starting something
that I would not be around to follow
up on.

We drove down to Lewisburg, Pa.
on Friday evening. We had had no
set ideas about what was expected
of us or what we could do for Buck-
nell. Arriving late we sat and rap-
ped with some of the students while
they found some rooms for us to
stay in.

Saturday morning we met and
decided to go to a lecture on Sensi-
tivity Training being given by Dan

All power to the people”

A wrong-righting rally, rock festival, or rock-throwing isn’t complete
today without some would-be Robespierre chanting that slogan. Admit-
tedly it contains no words longer than two syllables, which places it with-
in the intellectual reach of most New Leftists, but one still wonders if
‘they know what it means.

The average person might be tempted to say it means majority po-
litical rule, but then, in a race between Spiro Agnew and Jerry Rubin it’s
highly doubtful the latter would win. The defensive New Leftist could
claim, with his Military-Industrial-Complex-under-every-bed mentally, that
the people don’t actually control nominations and elections. Assuming
that’s correct and assuming it was changed, would the Silent Majority
vote the Cleaver-Rubin ticket? Doubtful, right? So majority rule is not
what they have in mind.

Maybe what they mean is power to particular people. We concede, it
would be time-consuming to shout ‘All power to radical students, radical
drop-outs, militant blacks, poor whites who didn’t vote for Wallace, and
Dr. Spock,” but the shorter version tends to mislead those humans who
always thought of themselves as people. Only our friendly neighborhood
New Leftist knows for sure, of course, who goes up against the wall and
who doesn’t.

The sad, truly sad, thing is that such a hackneyed slogan is typical
of a revolution that is supposed to represent something radically new.
Revolution after revolution in history has claimed to act for ‘‘the people,”
whoever they are, and “the people” have served as an excuse for count-
less acts of savagery and despotism. When New Left leaders scream ‘‘All
power to the people,”’ it’s evident from their actions — shouting down
speakers they don’t want to hear, blockading classes they don’t want
others to attend — that they mean “all power to us as the people’s self-
appointed representatives, and if the people don’t know what’s good for
them they better get out of our way.” Hitler and Stalin were sure they
were doing what was best for “‘the people’”’ too.

The substantive part of this slogan is ‘‘all power.” The days of Flower
Children and Gentle People are long gone. Now the New Left wants
power, and that power means coercion and violence, including burning,
bombing and shooting. Nothing original about that. When the Establish-
ment does it the New Left says sarcastically that it’s killing for peace.
Considering that, tnd considering it was the New Left who criticized the
officer who claimed he had destroyed the Vietnamese town in order to
save it, one wonders how the New Left gained a reputation as being less
hypocritical than older generations. The New Left loves everyone, except
the Middle Class, Pigs, and people over 30. The New Left is against war
abroad, but for it here at home. Napalm is bad, firebombs are good. The
New Left is for the people, except when the people disagree with it.

Would you really prefer “the people” to have all the power over your
life, power backed by the coercion of the state, or would you rather ‘the
people” and the state lose some of the power they already have over
your life? A much better slogan, and a much more radical and original
one, would be ‘‘All power to the individual.” Let neither Mark Rudd nor
an Establishment bureaucrat, but the individual himself make his own
decisions about his own life.

Letters Comment on A

(Continued from Page 2)
through _ illegitimate conception,
shows basic ignorence for sex-
uality, sexual relations, and repro-
induction. There are easily acces-
sible, inexpensive methods of birth
control. Any intelligent, informed
person, male of female, with a
mature, realistic attitude towards
sexual intercourse, can use these.

Also, there are legal, relatively
simple methods of sterilization
available to both males and fe-
males. Abortion is certainly not
the only way to prevent unwanted
children.

Whether or not abortion is synon-
omous with murder, is difficult to
say. It is true that professional
people are unsure of the exact mo-
ment when the human life of the
fetus begins. However, is this argu-
ment merely one of semantics? I
have seen legal abortions perform-
ed at five, siv, and even seven
months gestation.

I have also seen a child, born
prematurely at seven months, live
to go home. To base so much on an
hour, a day, or a month, is a cruel
technicality. And even if a fetus is
not regarded as posessing human
life, certainly it has the potential
of life. And is destruction of this
potential so different from the de-
struction of life itself?

Perhaps abortion does have a
place in our society. I feel it
should be made available to the
poor and uneducated who already
have too many mouths to feed.
Let it be used as a last resort with
people who are too uninformed to
obtain and use methods of birth
control. In this way, it may truly
eliminate unwanted and unloved
children. But let us not regard a
proceedure as searring as abor-
tion, as a panacea for the affluent
young, who have been blessed with
the opportunity to avoid such a
situation to begin with.

Regarding John H. Kueffner’s
quote of an annonymous Roman
Catholic Priest: “I will consider
the fetus a living being when they
start having funerals for miscar-

It is understandable that the
priest who made that statement
would like to remain annonymous.

Facts of Life

To the Editor:

‘After reading Miss Gough’s letter
(October 13 issue), and familiar-
izing myself with the “facts of 1970
life’ which she spelled out for me,
I began to doubt the quality of 1970
life. What will become of a society
in which love is so selfish as to not
want to be burdened with children?
I remember studying about the fall
of Rome, and how increasing cor-
ruptness of the Romans’ morals
contributed to that fall.

Is this where our world is head-
ed? This whole idea really worried
me — until I decided that natural
selection would solve the problem.
The advocates of abortion—those
who don’t want to be enslaved by
child-raising and the like (as Miss
Gouch put it) — will have no off-
spring.

They will have no children to
rear in their way of thinking. These
people are thus a dying breed. Wait
a few generations, and they will be
extinct.

Sincerely,
Mary Kubic

Doctor’s Bag

To the Editor:

Reading the Bucknellian in U.C.
on Tuesday I was appalled by the
adverse reactions of some to “The
Doctors Bag’’ and to the letter by
Margie Gough, and by the phrase
in that letter “abstractions like
‘The Population Explosion.”’ For
those who don’t yet know, this
is 1970 and the world’s number
one problem is pollution. Pollution
can not be ignored. We are literal-
ly killing ourselves (and everything
animal, vegetable, or mineral (yes
we're working on that too) around
us), and we will be literally dead
very soon unless we stop produc-
ing people right now.

People are pollution. The world
can not afford more pollution. The
only chance we have of reaching
“old age” is through population
control. If you are one who thinks

abortion is murder, think about
the homo-cide of man, all man.
Mer Wiren

The Senate

I have. some comments on the
guest column by Robert Wendel in
the Octobre 13, Bucknellian.

Most importantly, he is simply
mistaken in saying that the Senate
would have only the power to rec-
ommend to the Faculty and the
ABS, without the right to recom-
mend directly to the President.

In fact, exactly the contrary is
true in the proposal before the Fac-
ulty: the Senate would be set up
as the authorative representative
of the University Community, mak-
ing recommendations directly to
the President as delegate of the
Board of Trustees. In the event of
persisting disagreement with the
ABS or the Faculty, the point would
be arbitrated by a separate com-
mittee, whose decision would con-
stitute the final recommendation
of the Community.

It is thus completely inaccurate
to view this proposal as analogous
to the Council. We no longer pro-
pose a Senate which approaches
sovereignty, but neither do we call
for one which is a mere committee
of the Faculty, as the Council was.

Rather, the jurisdictions of the
Faculty and the Senate are more
clearly separated than they were
in earlier proposals, with the Fac-
ulty having clear primacy in mat-
ters of academic policy while the
Senate has a much more clearly
defined role as spokesman of the
Community in resource allocation
policy.

This is the key issue: can and
should these two be separated? I
pelieve that it would be better if
they were not, practically speak-
ing, here at Bucknell, the only way
to achieve such unity is by the
Faculty assuming the role of the
Senate, with perhaps token student
participation, an alternative which
was rightfully rejected by the Fac-
ulty last year. The Faculty with
such responsibilities would simply
become choked, and student par-
ticipation would scarcely bt mean-
ingful.

It is no secret that I regard the
current proposal as a good deal
less than what I would like to see.
In many ways, the concept of a co-
operative University Community
represented and embodied in a
Senate dealing with all University
policy, has been lost.

What remains, however, is a
substantially increased level of par-
ticipation by all elements of the
community in decisions which af-
fect them vitally. I do not believe
it is possible at this time and place
to have the changes in the Uni-
versity which I desire But this
proposal is still a very substantial
improvement.

We should never lose sight of
our ideals, but the road to their
realization is not necessairly that
of rejecting intelligent compromise.

Should We Even...

To the Editor:

I’m sure you anticipate a Te-
sponse on the “Should we even...”
question in your October 13 edi-
torial.

If you’re simply posing a ques-
tion to which, as you go on to say,
there are no current answers, then
I’m considerably less rankled. But,
if “. . . since their contributions to
the University, intellectually, spirit-
ually and financially are mini-
mal?” is a judgement on your part,
then I disagree.

There is considerably more “in-
tellectual” contribution made to
this University than you, the rest
of the student body and the faculty
realize. One of my earliest tasks
is to identify these sources for the
on-campus community and provide
you the vehicle for tapping them.
For my current needs, I look to
these sources for intelligent con-
tributions. And I use the words in-
terchangably though, according to
Webster’s, the only mutual synon-
ym is, rational. Not to dwell on se-
mantics, but I perceive the first as
highly developed thought; the sec-
ond as skillful or shrewd judge-
ment. Any institution obviously
needs both. If you perceive intel-
Jectual as scholarly thought ex-
clusively, then perhaps we have
little to disagree about.

“Spiritual” contributions leaves
me nonplussed. (I would say mysti-

fied, but it’s such a lousy pun). If
you mean in an ecclesiastical sense,
then I submit that the contribu-
tions of all are minimal. If you
refer to inspirational or emotional
contributions, I say again that it
ig merely untapped because of
some barriers in communication.
The physical ones I hope to remove
as quickly as possible. Then there
are the deaf ears: one belonging
to the alumnus immersed in his
own work-familiar sphere, the other
to the academician, suspicious, if
not totally intolerant, of anything
generated outside of academia.
They will require a great deal of
cultivation.

On financial contributions, you
have either been misled, or have
made a hasty judgment. If you will
check with the Development Office,
you will discover that 50% of the
first $7,000,000 raised in the current
campaign is alumni-related con-
tributions. By that I mean direct
gifts from alumni or gifts which
some alumnus was instrumental in
obtaining.

I think the alumni can play an
important role in the life and pro-
gress of this University. Consider-
abel time is now being spent defin-
ing roles that our varied alumni
may play in the University Com-
munity and which will be of bene-
fit’ to the many worlds of Buck-
nellians. In the interim, things are
beginning to happen to which you
may eventually be exposed

Sincerely,

Alumni
To the Editor

I write in reference to Mr.
Osher’s recent article, “Athletics
and the Senate” (Bucknellian, Oct.
13). My comment is not directed
at his personal view on the value of
intercollegiate ahtletics, but at the
question-statement “Should we even
waste our time bothering with the
alumni since their contributions to
the University, intellectually, spiri-
turally, and financially are mini-
mal?”

Whether the University ought to
“waste our time . . .with alumni’”’
is a legitimate, though debatable,
question. The characterization of
their contributions as “minimal,”
in my opinion, exceeds the facts.

The obvious rebuttal, of course,
is “Look around you. How did this
all get here, without the intellect-
ual, spiritual, and financial support
of our alumni and friends? How do
you minimize a pbuilding, a scholar-
ship fund, or a work of are?”’ One
cannot fault today’s student for
failing to appreciate what the ad-
dition of a library meant in terms
of University life in 1951; it does
mystify one a bit to realize that
such contributions are, even today,
considered minimal.

This, however, is not what really
disturbs me. It is the implication
that Bucknell alumni do not count
pecause they don’t care. That is
simply not true.

In recent months I have shared
the experience of the President,
trustees, and development staff in
working on the capital campaign.
I have met, come to know, and
worked with literally hundreds of
alumni who have given Bucknell
a substantial amount of their time
and talent—and, in the process
helped to raise the “minimal” sum,
to date of $7,400,000. Everyone of
them has responded simply because
they were asked to help. Why? I
can only surmise that they must
care about Bucknell.

Is this the kind of support one
characterizes as “minimal?” I
don’t think so. To those of us who
have had to ask for their assist-
ance and financial support their re-
sponse has been nothing less than
inspirational.

However, if Mr. Osher disagrees,
all is not lost. For he, too, will
someday be an alumnus. He will, I
hope, have a lifetime in which to
make his intellectual, spiritual, and
financial contributions to Bucknell.
No alumnus I have ever met would
deny him the satisfaction of a max-
imum contribution or be upset to

Of course, there are troublemakers and radical liberals among even

An older one, known as “Schroeder,’’ was causing trouble a short time

she plotted to use the newspaper to persuade the contented members of

the colony that they ought to have equal pay with men, the right to more

prestegious jobs, self-respect; and freedom from both household drudgery

and in loco parentis rules - in short, that they ought to renounce their very

heritage.

But the colony was so overwhelmingly hostile to her perverted aims
that she gave up before she had even written anything. She recently con-
fided to a member of this Commission (me), “Look, you know what the

girls here are like: you think I'm

Some other misfits called a mee

niggers they knew supported, depended on, and loved the curfew (at

decided to campaign for equal rights, anyhow.

But this will amuse you: These poor. sweet pickaninnies are going to
try to accomplish this by sending around a petition and then - get this -
presenting it to the AWS Senate. This is analogous, of course, to circulat-
ing a petition calling for mandatory miscegnation, and then presenting it
to the Alabama legislature. The childlike innocence of these niggers -
particularly the more “radical’’ ones - is really quite touching.

At any rate, it is reassuring to discover that, in at least one place in

Art Exhibit Opens,
Features ‘Shapes’

By PAMELA MAY

“Shapes,’’ Opening of an Exhibi-
tion: Paintings and Prints by John
Beckley, Professor of Art, will be
held Tuesday night, October 27
from eight to ten in the Bertrand
Library Gallery

“My art is the opposite of ex-
pressionism,”’ explained Beckley

“With expressionism, one ob-
viously expects an expression. In-
stead, my art is a nonstatement
which, in a sense, ecomes an ex-
pression also. But the difference
is one would not look at one of my
pieces and say, ‘Wow, what’s he
trying to say?’ I begin with a cal-
culated image, but it is, in essence,
a preconceived expression without
expression, meant simply to be
enjoyed.”

In reference to the opening night
Beckley commented, “An exhibi-
tion is a theatrical production: it is
exciting to attend and has a pre-
vailing atmosphere. People look at
one another as much as the art.
I find it amusing, for it’s amusing
to have all kinds of people come
and look at things on the wall. It
should be something everybody

wants to do because they don’t get
a chance to look at walls that
often!”

The catalogue itself, to be dis-
tributed at the opening, is a piece
of art.

It is ‘‘four in one,” that four im-
ages to be manipulated by indi-
viduals other than the artist.

“Art should be a participatory
experience,” Beckley declares
“People become involved in art
usually by looking at it, but if
forced to manipulate it themselves,
then they are certain to experience
direct participation in the work of
art.”

The exhibition is open to the
public and will remain on display
through November 27. Refresh-
ments will be served opening
night.

Teachers

A representative of the NYC
Board of Education will be in the
education office this Tuesday, at
3:30, for conferences with persons
interested in teaching positions in
the City schools.

Freshmen

Any freshman wishing to run for
class office should pick up a peti-
tion from the Dean of Student Af-
fairs Office and return it with 50
signitures from the Class of 1974
by Friday, October 30th, Any fresh-
man may sign as many petitions
as he or she wishes. There will be
a general meeting of candidates on
Monday, November 22nd in the
second floor lounge of Roberts Hall
at 6:30 p.m. Final elections will be
held Monday, November 9th.

Indigo

The Indigo steering committee
has scheduled a mass meeting to
discuss campus needs. The meet-
ing is Monday, at 7:00 in New
Dorm Pit. Students may raise ques-
tions about philosophy and internal
structure of the organization and
sign up to help with fall projects.
All members of the University com-
munity are invited to participate.
Men and women with suggestions
on expanding co-ed programs are
encouraged to attend the October

posed to them. Dean Dunlop point-
ed out that one of two things would
probably happen in such a case,

Either the particular administra-
tor would not remain in his posi-
tion long because it should be clear
that ‘“‘the philosophy of the Uni-
versity and the particular adminis-
trator were in conflict, and the ad-
ministrator would. probably not
want to remain here.”

Both issues, concerning the power
of the Senate find answers in the
implied powers of the Senate. The
Senate then becomes a formal

e group on members of the

iding issue in the debate
was the real power of the Senate
The question becomes ‘Does the
Senate really have any power or is
the faculty just trying to make it
look that way to please the stu-
dents?”

Lacy brought up the point that
President Charles H. Watts, II must
think there is some power vested
in the Senate because he is giving
up his chairmanship of the fac-
ulty to become chairman of the
Senate.

Final questions brought up in-
cluded the role of the ABS with
regard to the Senate committee on
student life and the necessity of
the committee of arbitration.

Many students voiced opposition
to the committee because it has no
student members at present, and as
Geoff Blood pointed out, ‘In the
final analysis it is the ultimate
authority and will decide the policy
which the University is to follow.”

According to Blood. ‘It defeats
the whole purpose of the Senate if
eventually the power is going to
rest with a small committee.”

Because of the absence of a
quorum no votes could be taken at
the meeting but Lacy noted that
the real purpose of the meeting
was informational rather than vot-
ing on the document.

Cap & Dagger’s Production Continues This Weekend

‘The Alchemist’ Earns Reviewer’s Accolades

By SONDRA BRANDLER
As I attempt to dash off a master-
piece of dramatic criticism, I find
the task very difficult. I begin to
wonder why I agreed to review

The Alchemist at all, why I did not
take refuge in the excuse that I
was just recovering from a bout
with theatrical flu and was not yet
healthy enough for literary ex-
ercise.

Instead, for some reason which
is not yet clear to me, I br ved
the Lewisburg autumn and made
it to the theatre just in time for
the opening performance of The
Alchemist. The impressions which
follow are, for the most part, en-
tirely my own, colored by my own
particular prejudices and tempered
by my very own flu

The choice of The Alchemist for
this year’s opening production was
an excellent one. The play, a bril-
satire by Ben Jonson, is one
does not seem to lose pop

as the s pass. As Pro-
- Baumwoll indicates in the

notes which appear in
the Cap and Dagger program:

The Alchemist hieves its comic
effects by stripping pretensions and
exposing hypocrisies.” I might add
that pretension and hypo

avarice and lust than are their

As the play progresses, it be-
comes clear that Jonson wished to
indicate that greed prevades all
sectors of society. Each victim be-
comes the representative for a
group attitude rather a clearly de-
veloped individual _ personality:

Epicure Mammon, the pleasure-
seeking knight, Abel Drugger, the
merchant, Ananias and Tribulation
Wholesome, The Puritan preachers,
and so on.

The fact that the characters are
intended caricatures rather than
fully developed personalities gives
the play tremendous comic poten-
tial. The actor must simply under-
stand the few key motives which
shape the character he plays and
then build on these. Nothing the
actor does is too wild or too ex-
aggerated as long as his interpre-
tation is consistent with his charac-
ter’s limited dimensions

Following Minor Changes

By JOAN STEIN

Features Editor’s Note: In an
interview with Pat Slover, pres-
ident of Indigo, reporter Joan Stein
discovered what changes evolved
with the re-vamping of the organ-
ization, and how its members are
elected. Those findings are reveal-

* ed in the following article.

Three years ago, Indigo stopped
functioning as an organization sole-
ly for independent women, and be-
came, instead, an organization for
everyone.

Indigo strives towards one main
goal: interaction. It encourages
interaction between faculty and stu-
dents, upperclassmen and fresh-
men, and virtually any other sim-
ilar groups on campus.

The only part of Indigo that is
limited to a specific segment of
the campus is the elections. Elec-
tions take place in the spring, and
voting is done solely by the in-
dependent women.

These women must elect a steer-

ing committee composed of three |

class representatives, a chairman,

a publicity representative, a sec- |

retary-treasurer and a sports rep-
resentative. A junior
representative, also a member of
this steering committee, is not
elected by the independent women.

This steering committee, open to
all suggestions, plans Indigo’s “‘cur-
riculum” for the year. This year,
a Student-Faculty picnic has al-
ready been held, and plans for

Yoga instruction, Thanksgiving
Basket distribution to Lewisburg
and a Selinsgrove Hospital Party
are in progress.

Indigo also sponsors a weekly
Student-Professor lunch program
in the student’s cafeteria, with
Indigo footing the bill

Though this semester’s exents
have already been planned, Chair-
man Pat Slover has emphasized
the fact that Indigo is a very flex-
ible organization, and that anyone
with an idea for activity may sub-
mit such to the steering committee
for consideration.

Indigo is no longer an organiza-
tion strictly for independent wo-
men. It is a remodeled, revised,
open-minded organization that wel-
comes everyone and everything. In
fact, Indigo is what the students
want it to be.

Freshman men, in the six weeks
they have spent at the University,
have been exposed to a number of
aspects of the fraternity rush pro-
gram. With a barrage of activities
aimed at acquainting the men with
the University’s fraternal organi-
zation, what is the impression that
has been conveyed with regard to
the rush program and the individual
fraternities themselves?

In order to investigate the gen-
eral attitudes toward fraternities
among the Class of 1974, one fresh-
man hall group was interviewed
regarding their feelings toward the
activities of the past six weeks.
The results of this survey are not
intended to speak for the entire
class, but are hoped to present a
fair picture of the major reactions
to fraternities at the University.

The Facts

Of the men questioned, just un-
der 20% of them did not participate
i of the rush activities, in-
cluding the formal rushes held on
two Sundays in September. The re-
maining freshmen felt that only a
limited amount could be learned
from these formal affairs, and any
impressions gained through this
process was not a particularly
valid one, since the brothers were
prepared for the activity and pur-
posely neglected to behave in their
normal manner.

Most students were at a loss,
however, to mention any other
formal methods of introducing the
freshmen to the University’s fra-

es. It was generally felt that
even though the brothers of a par-
ar house could not be eval-
uated, the freshmen could tell
something about the brother who
acted as his guide, and he could
somewhat evaluate his interest in
the house, if only by the physical
make-up of the building

As to the individual fraternities
themselves, more than half of the
men interviewed were somewhat
less than impressed with the
houses they saw, or only suffici-
ently pleased with one or two; but
freshmen did indeed decide which
houses they liked the best and
which they wanted to return to
later.

It seems, too, that the first im-
pression was the lasting one, and
that the freshman who was shown
around a fraternity by a brother
he considered unpleasant was not
likely to return to that house

Almost everyone who partici-
pated in the first open rush week
found this activity generally re-
warding. It was a good chance to
speak personally to several
brothers, and seemed a good op-

portunity to view the fraternity as
it “normally functions.”

The majority of freshman men
were likewise pleased with the in-
formal rush weekend, and found
it a good indication of the social
activities of the houses.

Based on the formal rush, open

survey was that several freshmen,
who were almost certainly against
joining a fraternity before the start
of the school year, decided in favor
of joining after participating in the
rush program.

In addition, though, some men
who were in favor of joining had

rush week and weekend, and oc-
casional participation in discus-
sions with brothers at the Bison,
slightly more than two thirds of
the interviewed freshmen expres-
sed either a definite interest or a
more than passing interest in join-
ing a fraternity.
The Feelings

They felt that fraternities were
either necessary or very favorable
to social involvement at the Uni-
versity, referring to ‘“social’” as
signifying both associations with a
close group of men and opportuni-
ties to meet women.

Those who decided against fra-
ternities, or tended toward that
view, did so for several reasons.
While some felt that they had no
need for fraternity life (in that
they did not care for the increased
social activity or felt it would be
a bad influence on their academic
pursuits), others objected to the
cost or were opposed to the organi-
zation for ‘moral reasons.”

yet to find a particular fraternity
that interested them.

Also learned was the fact that
although several men were aware
that illegal rushing was being prac-
ticed (rushing procedures deviat-
ing from the set of rules set down
by the Interfraternity Council),
they felt that the violations were
insignificant, and one freshman
suggested that rush rules be elimin-
ated altogether.

Freshman Women Favor
Survey Relates Reactions  Yours-Policy’s Retention

Regarding Rush Activity

By JACKIE STUBBA

Hours for freshman women:
there’s so much talk going on,
opinions flying and plans to some-
how abolish them by either sleep-
outs or petitions. In the past two
years there has been a strong move-
ment to change the situation ex-
isting beforehand. As a result of
that, hours were lengthened to a
more “reasonable” time and fresh-
man women were restricted for
only one semester rather than the
whole year.

One sophomore recently suggest-
ed that his class had “gotten it
down to that” and, now, it was up
to this year’s freshmen to ‘“‘get rid
of” the rest of it. Yet it seemed
there was not much support for
the sleepout this past Homecoming
weekend. Just how do the freshmen
women of this year feel about
“hours?”

The majority of the freshman wo-
men polled are in favor of having
hours, at least until mid-semester.
“J doubt if I’d be out later any-
way. I can wait until second se-
mester to do without them. I think
it’s necessary for discipline in the
beginning,” explained Janet Ger-
lach.

Karen Sharman said, “I don’t
mind them. It hasn’t restricted me
so far. I don’t think one semester
of hours is hurting anyone.”

A popular view besides hours for
one semester is keeping hours, but
only for half of the semester. “I
think you should have hours until
mid-semester. After this time
we've adjusted as much as we’re
going 'to,” said Debbie Ahlstedt. Sue
Spiece agrees, saying, “People for-
get that we haven’t had mid-terms
yet, so it might be good then. But
after that we’ve adjusted to most
everything.”

Of the same opinion, Ann Wen-
gert: “For the first two months
you should have hours. But now
(after two months) it’s a hassel be-
cause there are times when you
want to stay out later.”

Several girls proposed a compro-
mise of having hours on weekdays,
but not on weekends. They feel
such a system is needed during
the week for discipline, but that
the freedom would be good on Fri-
day and Saturday nights.

Cindy Wilk explained, “Hours are
good on weekdays, because it’s
good to gauge yourself to study,
but not on weekends.”

Although not a majority, there
are many freshman women argu-
ing the other way (in favor of

abolishing hours from the start).
“When you worry about getting in
at a certain time it wrecks your
evening,’ thought Karen Simpson.

Marti Feinberg stated, “I like to
stay out all night—personal free-
dom. I don’t like people telling me
when to come in. AWS has no right

to tell me I can’t go out when they »

can.

“It’s foolish-the girls have them
and guys don’t. Girls are supposed
to be as mature as guys,” said
Nancy Hornberger.

Stacey Sines agreed, “‘It’s not fair
that we should have them and the
men don’t. If we’ve come here to
grow up, having hours jsn’t grow-
ing up.”

On a “practical’’ side, engine-
ering student Randie Johnson said,
“Then I could work up on the hill
after midnight in the open class-
rooms.”

There doesn’t seem to be any
strong movement to abolish hours
completely from this poll. The
freshman women are satisfied to
have hours while they are first
adjusting to college life. The time-
limits seem reasonable and not re-
strictive; however, frosh girls

would like to see the hours policy g

changed to include only half of the
semester.

Most of the men would probably
like to see hours completely
abolished, that seems “normal;”
but there are some advantages
which a few women would appreci-
ate. One girl joked, ‘“Having hours
is a good excuse to get rid of a bad
date.”

Counseling Service’s Function
Rests in Problem - Discussion

By JOAN STEIN
Halfway up the hill, in the base-
ment of the Botany building next to
the C.A., is the small suite of

rooms that houses the Counseling
Service. This is a service with one
central function: to help students
with their problems.

The service, in operation for
many years, concerns itself with a
wide range of personal problems:
ranging from choosing a major and
getting to the bottom of poor aca-
demic motivation ‘sophomore
slump”) to working out problems
with home or parents and discuss-
ing the use of drugs. Any subject
which involves personal conflicts,
confusion, or lack of information

is considered appropriate for dis-
cussion.

The discussion is a private talk
between Dr. Wilder, (a psycholog-
ist) and the student. Like psychia-
trists, ministers, and doctors, psy-
chologists subscribe to certain pro-
fessional standards. One of the im-
portant standards as far as the stu-
dent’s welfare is concerned is con-
fidentiality: what can students dis-
cuss without fear of exposure?

The Ethical Standards published
by the American Psychological As-
sociation state that ‘safeguarding
information about an individual...
is a primary obligation of the psy-
chologist.”” And the University
takes the position that “the contact
between the student and the...
psychologist is to be kept com-
pletely confidential so that every
student wili be free to ask without
fear of exposure.”

This confidentiality will be broken
only when the student is a serious
danger to himself or. others.

Dr. Wilder pointed out that, of
1500 separate student problems over
the last seven years, only twice
was it necessary to involve parents
or deans against the student’s
wishes — and then only for the stu-
dent’s own protection.

Unfortunately, the strong em-
phasis on confidentiality may give
the impression that the Counseling
Service is reserved for people with
“dark” secrets, serious problems
and severe psychological hang-ups.
Though the Counseling Service is
equipped to help with such prob-
lems, the majority of students who

come to the Counseling Service are
students who are looking for help
with values, future careers, or rela-
tionships with others.

More often than not, the student
has as big a role in resolving his
“problem” as does the counselor.
The counselor and the student have
to work together if the student is +
to feel any real satisfaction from
counseling. And it is usually the
student himself whe must decide
what the right course is for him.

of the 1970 football season, there
is one team that can almost clinch
a post-season bowl game with a
win this Saturday. gth-ranged Stan-
ford, by notching a victory over
U.C.\L.A., can take a giant stride
toward its first Rose Bowl appear-
ance since 1952.

The Indians are a 10-point choice
to win the big one.

It seems we'd better do a quick
analysis of our college forecasting
average . . there just isn’t room
anywhere else. Through games of
Saturday, October 10th, we've been
right in 676 games and wrong in
214 for a .759 batting percentage.

Two weeks ago, we practically
struck out in the East, picking only
14 winners out of 28 games. How-
ever, a couple of weeks earlier, in
the Midwest, the crystal ball bounc-
ed amazingly right on 38 out of 43.
So, it all seems to balance out.

Meanwhile, back in the football
warfare department, top-ranked
Ohio State will ramble over Illinois
by 45 points, and Texas, number 2,
will crush Rice by 27.

Notre Dame, still in third, has a
vacation, 5th-ranked Nebraska
takes on the Cowboys of Oklahoma
State. The Cowboys have a habit of
surprising the daylights out of top-
ranked teams in the Big Fight.
However, the Cornhuskers will es-
cape trouble and win by 17 points.

With the Little Brown Jug up for
grabs, the 7-th ranked Wolverines
of Michigan will clip Minnesota by
nine points. Sixth-ranked Tennessee
js 22 points stronger than Florida.

Wichita State starts its 1970 foot-
all season all over again this week
against 9th-ranked Arkansas.

The Razorbacks will win it, but
we're offering no point spread.

The Air Force and Arizona State,
rated 12th and 13th respectively,
will continue to win. The Falcons
will beat Boston College by 17 while
the Sun Devils will slip a big needle

to Texas at El Paso .
is 24 points.

The Southeast Conference feature
game this week pits 4th-ranked
Auburn against 16th-rated L. s. U.
The Tigers from Louisiana have
wipped everyone since being upset
by Texas A & M in their opener.
However, the Tigers of Alabama
appear to be stronger: Auburn to
win by 13 over Louisiana State.

Tenth ranked Southern Cal should
have no difficulty with Oregon . -
the Trojans are favored by 223
points. 14th-rated Houston will just
edge Alabama, by one.

Giacomelli Leads Gridmen

By ALAN GROCHAL

“The Davidson game was my
best game of the season as well as
the biggest team victory since I’ve
been at Bucknell.

These words were uttered by
senior halfback Don Giacomelli af-
ter the Bisons’ upset victory over
Davidson, 21-20.

“Jock” turned in another consis-
tent rushing performance, picking
np 62 yards on 14 carries.
Giacomelli is a co-captain along
with defensive tackle Gene Depew.
His main jobs are to lead team
calisthenics and to act as a liason
between the players and coaches.

BU Racketmen Shine in
League Tennis Tourney

By JIM LACKRITZ

Last Saturday, three members of
the Bison tennis team journeyed
to Bethlehem to compete in the
Middle Atlantic Conference Tennis
Championships.

From their fine performances at
Lehigh, the netmen appear to be
ready to capture a third straight
MAC championship this spring.

Number one man, Steve Baird,
followed up last weekend’s victory
in the Hank Peters Memorial
Tournament by reaching the finals
in singles play. Baird defeated Ted
Sauers of Rider, the number two
seeded player from Rider in the
semi-finals, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0, before bow-
ing to Frank Barnett from St.
Joseph’s in the finals, 7-5, 6-3.

It was the second time Barnett
had captured the singles crown.

Captain Alex Anderson, who had
teamed with Baird to take the
doubles in the Hank Peters Me-
morial Tournament, teamed with
number three man, Jim Lakritz, to
share the doubles title.

Bison Polomen Enter
Yale Water Polo Meet

By MARK KNODERER

The water polo. club travels to
‘New Haven this Saturday to par-
ticipate in the Yale Water Polo
Tournament. Yale currently reigns
as the number one team in the
East, and is favored to win the
tournament.

In all, ten teams will be enterel
in the tournament, including three
from Yale, two from Army, St.
Francis, and the Bisons.

Coach Dick Russell did not waste
any time arranging a match with
the Eli. The Bisons face the Yale
“A” team in a nonleague match at
12:30 Saturday afternoon, before
the tournament even begins.

Last year Yale blasted the Bi-
sons 17-4 in the finals of the Eas-
tern Water Polo championships. In
that game Russell’s men were tired
from the long tournament and play-
ed before a hostile crowd.

Yale is just as strong this year
though. They defeated a powerful
Cornell squad 16-11, and the Bisons
have not yet forgotten the 22-10
licking they took from the Big Red
two weeks ago.

Last Saturday, the club ventured
to State College to scrimmage Penn
State’s first water polo team. About
all the match showed was that the
Nittany Lions will have to wait a
while longer before they can stay
with the Bisons. The club peppered
the Penn State goalie with s0
many shots that after awhile the
score was not even kept.

The Bisons could use a lot of
goals this weekend.

match, and did not lose a set
througout the tournament.

They justified their number one
seeding with victories over teams
from West Chester, Temple, and a
6-4, 6-1 thrashing of Rider in the
finals.

After a very successful fall sea-
son, including some fine showings
in the ECAC and MAC Champion-
ships, the netmen are looking for-
ward to another successful season
this spring, and will try to match
last year’s unblemished 14-0 record.

Don Giacomelli along with co-cap-
tain Gene Depew are leading the
Bisons to an exciting season of
football.

In addition to being a running
back, “Jock” returns punts and
kickoffs.

“Qn punt returns, Gene Lucca-
relli and I have an agreement that
the man nearest the ball will take
it. We then set up a wall return to
either the right or left.”

As a deep man on kickoff re-
turns, Giacomelli’s job is to follow
a four-man wedge in front of him.
The return plays are designed to
go up the middle.

His assignments on pass plays
call mostly for blocking

yard dash and at at 6’22”, 200
pounds, he can use speed or call on
brute power for runs.

“Jock” sees great improvement
in this year’s team as compared
to last year’s.

“Offensively, our line is much
improved over last season, and on
defense we are a good deal more
experienced,” he said.

Giacomelli rated Davidson as the
best all-around team of any of th
Beisons’ previous opponents.

He considers last year’s Lafayet-
te game his greatest game as a
Bison. “Jock” led the Thundering
Herd to a come-from-behind 21-20
victory as a substitute for injured
quarterback Greg Doviak.

Throughout his three years of
varsity ball, Giacomelli has played
quarterback, halfback, returned
kicks and punts, and even punted
on occasion. He is truly one of the
most versitle Bisons.

“Jock” is an accounting major,
but is unsure of what he will do
after graduation.

“T have several job interviews in
future weeks. There is a small pos-
sibility I could go into coaching
although I need more education
credits.”

Gridders Stalk Leopards
For Parents’ Day Thriller Bison Harriers Win Sixth;
| Gulden Cites Team Effort

By DAVE COULTER

When the Bisons clash with La-
fayette Saturday afternoon, the
Parents Day crowd will undoubted-
ly see one of the toughest gridiron
battles of the season

The Leopards will be out to
avenge a 21-20 defeat by the 1969
Bison team, when BU came from
behind with 21 points in the second
half to grab the veitory.

The Bisons will be coming home
after two rugged away contests
with southern opponents and will
be eager to meet the opposition
on home ground

Each of the games in recent
years has been within three or
four points and this one is certain
to be fiercely played

Even though both squads are

off defeats, each has dis-

otent offense. The Leop-

ards attack is strikingly similar
to BU’s.

They are lead by the quarter-
back duo of h McKay and Jack
Hickle. McKay is a fine passer with
587 yd. and a 45% completion ay-

, and he could pose a prob-
lem for the Blue’s injury-riddled
secondary

His counterpart is Lafayette’s
answer to Howie Burke, and is a
great running threat when he is
in the game. Powering the back-
field is Bob Donoforio, a 5-
pounder with a 6.3 yd. pe
average

Coach Prender believes he is
“one of the best runners BU will
face all year.”

The Leopards have shown their

prowess in their last
mes as they have scored
against both Pennsylvania
hly regarded Delaware

Lafayette also has a veteran de-
fensive secondary which could spell

uble for the Bisons faltering

ing game

The Bisons will be
their rivals with quarterback
Howie Burke, and fullback Rich
Diez. Burke has successfully kept
the opposition off balance with the
option play and will probobly con-
tinue to do so against Lafayette.

ad h

countering

&¢

The BU Bison will trample the
Lafayette Leopard for the second
year in a row Saturday.

However, BU will
prove its passing attack if it is to
defear the Leopards.

Running has thus far been the
stabilizer of the Bison attack. Diez
is leading the squad with a 4.6
yard average and Burke is second
with a 3.5 yard average.

The running power of the Blue
team could be an important factor
as other teams have moved the
ball on the ground against Lafayet-
te this year.

The strong defensive line of the
Bisons which neutralized the
mighty running attack of the
Citadel for most of last week’s
game, will once again have its
work to do with Donoforio. Perhaps
the biggest question defensively is
injurie:

Now among the iujured or ques-
tionable are Gilewicz, Cassidy,
Giacomelli, Durtan, and Moretz.
Coach Prender believes, though,
that some of these players will be
ready for action and confidently
asserts that BU will be set for a
tough game Saturday.

He also feels that this will be a
highly emotional game, as it is a
‘traditional’ contest with an old
conference adversary. Therefore,
the Coach lists this as ‘‘one of the
most important games of the year.”

Mars Captains Pitchmen;
Predicts Bright Prospects

By DAVE COULTER

i the last place one
would expect to find the Captain
of the Bison soccer team would be
at the bottom of Trax hall. But,
if you should happen to overhear
some underground Trax’ers talk-
ing about their “talented toe,” you
can bet that the object of their con-
versation is Glenn Mars

For besides starring on the B.U
soccer squad, Glenn is a freshman
hall counselor. He classifies this
position as a “real experience”
and points to the spirit of his hall
group which has been working in
Selinsgrove with the mentally re-
tarded in their spare time.

During his high school career,
Glenn played center-halfback and
fullback on teams at James Cald-
well High School and helped his
team capture the All-State Title
He feels, that playing in the Ger-
man-American league helped to de-
velop the all around soccer ability
that has become familiar to Bison
fans.

Last year Glenn played primarily
at center-halfback, while seeing
occasional action on the line. This
year, however, he has been moved
to the line where he leads the Big
Blue attack

The Bison Captain, though, feels
that he is ‘more a playmaker”
for the team than the big potent-
ial scorer. For as opposed to last
year’s offense which was centered
about leading scorer Dave Rath,
this year’s team utilizes a “‘bal-
anced attack.”

Any of the front five are a “
scoring threat,” as has
proven so far this season.

Although this year’s team is
young an inexperienced, Glenn sees
bright prospects if they continue

real
been

to show “hustle and desire,” Since
they are mostly sophomores and
juniors, the 1970 squad has more to
work for with regard to the future
than last season’s squad did
Thus they are ‘‘not afraid of con-
ditioning’’ and know that they must
work to compensate for their inex-
perience, and build for the coming
years
This year’s Captain is “‘proud to
play for the team,” especially since
they work together. ‘‘There is no
bickering on the team,’’ Glenn re-
ports, “It’s all constructive and
everyone benefits.” He also has
praise for the “fine job’? Coach
has done in developing

One other factor which Glenn
feels is “tremendous” is the ‘‘fan-
tastic support” that the B.U. fans
have been giving the booters this
year

He is especially encouraged that
people are now “talking soccer”
and really following and appreciat-
ing the team and its efforts

It can be certain, however, that
all the B.U. soccer fans harboring
similar hopes for this ye: squal
will find a leader and an inspira-
tion in senior captain Glenn Mars.

THE BUCKNELLIAN

OCTOBER 23, 1970

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

“Cross country is a team sport,”
declares first year coach Gulden.
The truth of this statement must
be considered when one glances at
his team’s impressive 6-1 record.
The Bison harriers have won their
last three meets. They ran over
Gettysburg 22-36 and picked up two
overwhelming victories in a tri-
angular meet with Susquehanna
and Dickinson, defeating them 20-
40 and 19-41 respectively.

In the triangular meet, freshman
Scott Bartram set a new BU course
record as he sprinted across the
finish line in 27 minutes and 33
seconds.

This achievement is even more
spectacular when one considers
that Bartram negotiated the 4.8
mile course on a cold day after a
hard rain

Coach Gulden stresses his team’s
spirit, however, when talking
about his runners. He feels that
“when the boys run in a bunch

Players of

John Klenovic and Rick Diez
have been named  Bucknell’s
players of the week for outstand-
ing performances against The
Citadel. The Bisons lost the game
at Charleston, S.C., 42-28. It was
the second time both players have
won the award this season.

Klenovic was the offensive player
of the week against Temple in the
season’s opener. The 5-10, 190-pound
junior did an excellent job block-
ing and opened up many holes for
the Bison backs. BU gained 217
yards on the ground in 48 attempts
for a 4.5 average per try.

Coach Fred Prender said, ‘John
played another fine football game
for us. His blocking is just out-
standing.

“He continually knocks down
people who are much bigger than
he is

“John has an excellent attitude.
He was injured in the Davidson
game the week before, but shook
it off and came back like a real
champion.”

Diez made only his second start
of the season at fullback, but he
had been honored as the offensive
player of the week for the Gettys-
burg game. He is the first sopho-
more to be honored two times in a
season since 1968 when Paul Gile-
wicz won the award twice.

The 6-2, 180-pounder continued
his torrid running pace and hard
hitting blocking. Diez carried the

burg, BU captured nine out of
thirteen positions.

The team also has to be con-
sidered in the building stage, even
with a 6-1 record, because, of the
Thundering Herd’s top five runners
last week, three were freshmen and
two were sophomores.

Coach Gulden also noted that one
of his better runners, freshman Bill
Ledgerwood, had a knee strain and
has been unable to compete for the
Bisons the past week.

To follow up the cross country
season, Coach Gulden wants to es-
tablish a winter track program.

The winter track program at BU
has never gotten off the ground
but this year Coach Gulden hopes
to be able to send his team to
some invitationals in order to get
ready for a busy spring season.

Gulden feels that, ‘A successful
track season must include a con-
ditioning cross country program.
The two go hand in hand.”

It should be very interesting to
watch the development of BU’s
track program over the next years.

placing in the triangular meet with
Susquehanna and Dickinson were

Kirkland Informs Parents,

By BILL WHITNEY

“What you get is an essential,
fundamental, distinctive thing: a
peculiar emptiness, silence, and an-
onymity.”’

This was the central theme of Dr.
John D. Kirkland’s speech to par-
ents ‘What You Get for $3,700 at
Bucknell” given Saturday morning
in Vaughan Literature Auditorium

Dr. Kirkland, associate professor
of history, began by stating that
this was a “‘pointed and legitimate
qquestion’’ for parents to ask in
view of the strang things going on
throughout campuses today.

He went on to say the value of
the University is not its campus
buildings, or athletic and_ social
programs. These things are im-
portant, but are unessential, and

“could probably be gotten cheaper
or better elsewhere.

Neither are the academic and
skill programs the main worth of
college. They are indeed valuable,
but the programs are not “central,
dominant, fundamental’ because
they can cover only a limited area.

Their value is derived from some-
thing else - people.

The people of the campus are
other students, and most important-
ly the professors. However, even
the professors are not essential;
they are not molds to imitate or
leaders to follow.

The professor plays a “central
but indirect role’ in concerning the
student with three questions: (1)
Where are you? (2) What is there
to say and hear? and (3) Who are
you?

In relation to the first question,
the professor seeks to have the stu-
dent see wherein he exists and
what character it has. The profes-
sor then points out the differences

tween the way in which the stu-
dent sees where he is and the way
others see it.

BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA

Faculty Takes No Action
On ABS Princeton Plan

By JUNE CAFFREY

The University Faculty effective-
ly took no action on the ABS pro-
posal of a ‘‘watered-down” Prince-
ton Plan Friday.

This plan is one whereby students
wishing to leave the campus the
week prior to state and local elec-
tions for the purpose of campaign-
ing, would be given a grade of “‘in-
complete’ in their first semester
classes (if necessary) with a stipu-
lation that the work be made up by
the first week of second secester.

The faculty’s final decision was
to continue its present policy con-
cerning “‘incompletes” (fourth week
of second semester) and to reaf-
firm its good faith in legitimate
student excuses for absenteeism.

Dave Lacey, president of ABS,
pointed out that students should
have the same opportunities in so-

ciety as other citizens. He stated
that the purpose of this plan was
to give the student a “chance to
fulfill both his responsibilities as a
citizen and as a student.”

Dr. Gene Chenoweth, professor of
Political Science, proposed that a
committee be set up to study the
ABS proposal and present it to the
University Senate (when establish-
ed) for a decision.

He agreed that there should be a
guideline for students who wish to
campaign but he felt that the pro-
posal had come too late.

Dr. Mills Edgerton, professor of
Spanish, made reference to the
notice received by the faculty from
the Internal Revenue Service, con-
cerning outside activities of the
University.

He noted that “according to Fed-
eral law, Bucknell might endanger

Steering Committee Set Up

SIS Fashions ‘Wide Open’ Constitution

By PAMELA. MAY

The Steering Committee of the
Student Information Service has
drawn up a constitution stating its
purpose and structure, and expects
funds from the ABS soon.

The document reads:

“The SIS is designed to provide
a means of reaching and helping
those students whose needs are not
presently being met by other organ-
izations. It will provide information
on current youth and student con-
cerns, provide readily available,
anonymous contact with peers by
means of a crisis intervention
phone, provide a referral service
for those students seeking advice
in specific areas of professional
help, provide immediate personal
contact in case of emergencies, and
provide other services as neces-
sary.”

As steering committee members
note, the arrangement is ‘‘quite
wide open and allows for a lot of
avenues, which was done on pur-
pose.”’ They explained that each
member has various ideas of what
they want done; SIS is all those

ideas brought together through com-
mittee meetings.

A three-fold structure is set up.
including the information center,
the crisis intervention phone, and
“contact counseling.’’ The program
is not completely operative yet;
they are waiting for phones to go
in, and training of counselors to be

Dateline: The Campus

By CATHY EVANS
(New York Times) - A group of “Eastern Intellectuals’ met
with labor leaders Saturday at Harvard University to form an ac-
tive alliance to fight “reactionary political forces in our country.”
The group agreed that ‘There are people in this country who are

trying to divide the workers from the students;

it is as cold and

calculated a strategy as the Southern strategy, but there are no
two groups that have more in common than the working people and
students. It was also noted that ‘The current attacks on students,
universities and intellectuals are only the spearhead of a general
offensive against all progressive forces in our country, among which
organized labor is a major component.” George Wald, a Nobel
laureate in biology at Harvard, was the group’s main organizer.
A white building at Dickinson College has caused SDS and other
students to investigate the extent of federal activities involved. The
building is being contracted for use as a civil defense shelter by a
‘non-controversial government agency.’ According to George Shur-
man, Financial Vice-President, Treasurer an the college’s contact
with the federal government, “rumors of affiliation with the CIA and
the Carlisle War College are true only in the fact that all these
agencies are also part of the federal government’s extensive com-
munications system.” The building, originally a potato chip factory,
was purchased by the university in 1954 mainly, notes Shurman, be-
cause of “the college’s concern over the rancid odors which came
from the factory and wafted over to permeate the President’s

house.”

Peter Davis Outlines
Palestinian Situation

By G. PETER BALAKIAN

Peter Davis, British Document-
ary Film maker, spoke last night
on the Palestinian situation in the
Middle East.

Davis began by talking about the
question of morality in relation-
ship to the Israeli evacuation of the
Palestinians from Palestine in 1948.
After a brief account of the histori-
eal events that have led up to the
present, Davis explained the Israeli
ideologies that rationalized the oust-
ing of these two million Arabs.
Similar parallels were drawn to our
own American Expansionist ideolo-
gies of the early nineteenth cen-
tury.

The Israeli ‘Manifest Destiny,”
he claimed, produced the feeling
that their claim to Palestine was
far superior than the Palestinian’s
because of -historical reasons.
Furthermore, the Jews felt that
the land belonged to those who
were best suited technologically to
use it. Thus, as Davis stated, it
became a situation where the more
technologically advanced overthrew
the less technologically advanced.
Davis reverted back to the Western
European beckground which en-
abled the Isralis to possess this
superiority.

In continuing his argument, Davis
felt that today’s Palestinian is an-
alogous to yesterday’s Jew. The
Jews have persecuted the Palestin-
ians just as they have been per-
secuted for centuries.

Davis also touched on various
other topics. He explained the new
unity which this persecution has

aroused in the Palestinians, and
how it has caused the formation of
the ‘Palestinian National Libera-
tion .Movement.’’ Davis . praised
Jordanian King Houssain for the
manner in which he has managed
to make Jordan a prosperous nation
even with the burden of having one
million refugees in his country

The Hustle

The Bucknellian is inadvertantly to in
helping the Faculty hustle the students.
We only report the news. Sometimes,
however, we leave out important back-
ground material.

Once upon a time there was an
idea to change the governance of the
University. A Governance Committee
made up of students, administrators and
faculty worked hard to arrive at a pro-
posal for the governing of the University
by a decision-making body called The
Senate. It was defeated by a few votes
in a Faculty meeting last year. That
document included students in the over-
all functioning of the University, on all
levels. It reduced the Faculty to second-
ary importance as a legislating body on
campus, and elevated the students from
slavery to citizenship. It recognized the
University as a place where faculty and
students learned from each other via a
mutual exchange of ideas. That docu-
ment started to re-define the education
we offer here.

Summer intervened. Some faculty
members, unwilling to submit to the
aging system we have here, sought to
refurbish the old Senate to accomodate
those few dissenting voters: The Com-
mittee of Four united, and out of wed-
lock, gave birth to the document referred

GUEST COLUMN
| UMOJA
By STEVE WYATT

by request of the A.B.P.

One of the more interesting aspects of this year is the heavy work
Joad that almost everybody seems to be experiencing. Since this is a pro-
blem shared by everyone, black or white, that I have run into so far it
bears a little examination. Of course it may be my ‘‘paranoid’’(?) nature
breaking out, but then again there could be a political hook in it some-
where. So perhaps it is wise to look at the situation in the wider context
of events.

Campus unrest has become, in the service of “eonservations’” a major
political bogeyman. Institutions such as this one are usually sensitive to
these types of pressures and inordinately fond of prestige in any event.
So they have an obvious need to keep their students quiet, and at the same
time avoid making radical changes

Since all institutions of this nature are partially dependent on gifts, it
should be easy to draw up def . It could quite easily be an actual one,
in spite of our building program and athletic expansion. The key point,
however, is not its actual existence, but the handy excuse it offers for not
doing anything.

If you simultaneously load people down with a heavy work-load they
might be rather too busy to run around disputing the point, and we don’t
have access to the presidents books in any e. So add a little judicious
sermonizing here and there, for seasoning, mix with student leaders being
Jed around by the nose by administrators from one committee meeting to
the next, and stir into a subtle if sophisticated way of keeping us quiet, if
not contented. Of course you don’t have to get alarmed. All this doesn’t
have to be true. Then again it doesn’t have to be false either.

One of the better known and perhaps better liked black students with-
drew this semester. While there are many of us who look forward to com-
pleting our four years here, it was felt significant enough to devote some
thought and discussion as to why he left.

The reason he gave was that he had not “adequately defined his
goals.’”” One might be, as some were, amused by his inability to clarify
them. But have we adequately defined ours? Here we made up our minds
as to why we are really here, and what, if anything this institution can
offer to people? And if nothing, why stay? Assuming there is something,
when and how can we take advantage of it. It would seem it is high time
we adequately answered the question, What am I doing here? Personally I
feel the main goal for us to work tow ards up here is acquiring skills and
applying them in ways beneficial to our community. Other answers may
come from other people but answers we must have if there is any point
to it at all.

One of the perenial problems people face is disunity. Often described
in almost philosophical terms, the links of togetherness among people to-
day are constantly remarked on, commented about, criticized, and -an-
alyzed. One is told in analyzing a problem, a major step it to define one’s
poals. If we are ever going to achieve any kind of unity among peoples
of the world today at least we are going to have to agree on what we
mean by the term.

Is this unity going to be a spiritual matter, a totally unworldly tran-
scendent force acting on and not through the concrete people with concrete
needs which we have here. It is the total absence of friction or will some
“working things out’’ help the cause of togetherness in the end. In other
words when we speak of this kind of peace what are we talking about and
why?

One of the many strange African sounding concepts which has spinkled
the Black Community is “Umoja” meaning collective work and responsi-
bility. It refers to working towards building a community, as has been
seen in armies, groups, and teams of all descriptions. People really feel
united when all their activities mesh-when all they are working towards
fits into a common goal.

But what is our goal. Is what we are doing here of any benefit to
people or to any one individual, or even ourselves? Perhaps a purpose is
needed to bring us together, one we all agree on. I can see a great need
for this type of definition in the days ahead.

To the Editor:

Although I am certain there are
several members of the Bucknell
Faculty and student body who could
reply to the letter sent in by R. L.
Lyon, ’29 quite affectively, I, too,
should like the opportunity to ex-
press my views concerning this
letter published in the 9/11/70 issue
of the Bucknellian and entitled
“Ashamed.”

Mr. Lyon apparently was quite
upset about the fact that some stu-
dents and members of the Bucknell
faculty wished to vocally and force-
fully express their views concern-
ing the events and happenings re-
lated to our involvement in the
war in Vietnam.

No one will deny that Mr. Lyon
has both the right and privilege to
express his views on any matter
concerning the actions of our gov-
ernment be they national or inter-
national in nature. This being so,
doesn’t the same rights and privi-
leges apply to the students and fac-
ulty members of Bucknell? Should-
n’t they, too, be afforded the op-
portunity to express their views
concerning the situation in Viet-
nam? And, especially the students
since they may conceivably be
called upon to “‘put on the line”
their most precious posession—uife
itself?

Is it his view that a University,
any University or college, should
adopt the position of the ostrich
and isolate itself from the “‘out-
side world?’’ Should the student
and faculty concern itself with only
the events that exist within the con-
fines of the campus itself and ig-
nore the world that lies beyond its
boundaries? Is it the function of
a University to ‘‘produce’”’ after 4
years of academic study, ‘‘aca-
demic idiots’? who are totally, or
even partially, unaware of decis-
ions, forces and events that can,
and do, affect their very existence
as well as their future?

It may very well be that Mr.
Lyon is unaware of the fact that
the world has changed consider-
ably since he attended Bucknell.
And, whether he likes it, or not, the
world will continue to change. The
beautiful thing about the vast ma-
jority of our youth of today is their
simple directness and their forth-
rightness in stating, candidly and
directly, their feeling and opinions.
The youth of today does not hesitate
to get involved. And, he does so
with the honesty of his convictions.

It has been my pleasure and pri-
vilege to speak with many students
and several members of the faculty
and administration, including the
present president, Dr. Watts. I did
not find them to be so self-centered,
or give the impression that they
had all the answers. They were

Idealists vs. Realists

By CHARLES MUSSMA\

Some time ago on this campus there was a subcommittee. Now this
was not an ordinary subcommittee. No, it was a special subcommittee
composed of special people. This subcommittee was supposed to prepare a
document on the future academic program at this University. What did
these people do? Did they go to books? Did they go to other universities?
No, they went into the University Community to find the answers to dif-
ficult questions, for who can know more about something than someone

who is involved in it?

Now as the subcommittee went around and around finding answers,

they also found problems—many problems, large problems, facts that ©

could not be ignored. So the subcommittee began to wonder, ‘How can we
define the future academic program without first defining objectives of
education?’’ So the recommendations came:

. we propose that all members of the Bucknell community commit
themselves to participation in a common, university-wide, effort to
think and act reflectively about the values and presuppositions which
have governed, now govern, of ought to govern their own approach to

inquiry. . .

COMMUNITY AND THE SENATE

The subcommittee thought about our University. And they saw that it
was not good. So these people put forth another radical idea: community.
The university is not a unified whole at the present time. Yet, the sub-
committee found that the unified campus is more than the sum of its
parts. This University is made up of diverse elements, but unless these
are brought together into a more cooperative, participative relationship
the future academic growth of this institution is threatened.

So the subcommittee debated what should be done. Their findings
were disseminated in a report called Toward Academic Excellence (the
Cooper Subcommittee Report). The final proposal stated in part:

The present structure of the university is not as conducive to com-
munity and participative decision making as it might be . . . We there-

fore recommend the creation of a University Senate .

. . All decisions

of the Senate should be binding on the entire academic community...

What happened to this special subcommittee’s report? Nothing, we are
sorry to say. And do you know, to this very day it is sitting somewhere in
the archives of theBertrand Library—a forgotten masterpiece.

THE PRESENT DECISION

Now that the Faculty has passed a document defining a method of
campus governance, the A.B.S. can finally formally voice the opinions of

students by ammending or rejecting

the present document. Should we, the

students, act as idealists with the Cooper Subcommittee Report as our
model or as political realists? This is a difficult decision. If we are ideal-
istic, we cannot see the seeming uselessness of striving to reach an im-
possible goal. Yet, if we are realistic, we may never find answers to many
problems surrounding us such as pollution, population, and war, since so
often the solutions seem to be unreachable goals.

Whatever the A.B.S. decides, whether they decide to scrap the present
proposal in favor of a more idealistic solution, or they decide to be political
realists, there are a few points in the present document before them that

they must consider.

NEEDED CHANGES

Firstly, if the Senate is to be of any real use (as opposed to being an-
other bunch of red-tape)it must have decision-making power. The present
document repeatedly uses the words “‘to review and recommend” when
describing the limitations of the Senate. We propose that the A.B.S, change
every instance of ‘‘recommend”’ to “determine policy subject to the ap-
proval of the President and Board of Trustees.”

Secondly, after the Senate determines a course of action, both the
Faculty and the A.B.S. have the power to return the decision to the Senate
with objections. According to the present document, the second time this
happens the decision is sent to a Committee of Arbitration consisting of
three members, non of them students. We propose that this committee be
eliminated and in place of it require a two-thirds vote of the Senate to pass
a proposal over the objections of either the Faculty of the A.B.S.

Lastly, we as students have been told that: because students will be
on the Senate, and because the Senate will work with the budget, and be-
cause control over the budget is the key to a great deal of power; there-
fore, students will have a great deal of power. Q.E.D. However, the pre-
sent document provides for review of the budget after it has been adopted.
and although it is given the power to “recommend policies to the Presi-
and although it is given the power to “recommend policies to the Yresi-
dent . . . for the principle allocationes of the general University budget,”
the meaning of the wording is not clear, and it is subject to interpretation
in many ways. We propose that the wording be changed to ‘“The Senate
will review and may propose changes in the budget during its formula-

tion.”

By no means will these proposals satisfy the idealist. However, both
the political realist and the idealist should be able to agree that the
amendment of the document in accordance with these proposals will make
a stronger, more effective University Senate.

very intelligent people striving to
meet the challenges of today and
seek the most effective way to meet
these challenges. And that is all we
can expect of anyone. To do their
best to make the world a better
place to live in. No where in his
letter does Mr. Lyon acknowledge
the fact that students or faculty
members were NOT coerced in any
way. Those who wished to attend
classes or continue their studies
were able to do so without being
harrassed in any way. Nor does he
state the fact that the views of the
students and faculty were presented
in a democratic fashion and with-
out the violence and mob-rule that
was the ease on other campuses
in our country. Not a building was
burned! Not a student was injured
or killed! It was never even re-
motely necessary to call upon the
local police or the National Guard
to control or subdue the activities
an the Bucknell Campus. Yet, their
voices were heard and their views
expressed! !!

Had Mr. Lyon been on campus

during the time he alludes to, he
would be proud, not ashamed, of
the Bucknell student of today. Un-
fortunately, I never had the privi-
dege of attending Bucknell in my
younger days. But, had I been a
member of the alumni of Bucknell,
I would have been proud of the
events that occurred on that cam-
pus. In fact, I would walk ten feet
tall. And, considering my rather
relatively short stature, that is tall
indeed.

May I suggest, in closing, that!’

you invite Mr. Lyon to Bucknell so
that he can see for himself how
things are up there. Urge him to
speak with the strdents and fac-
ulty. Let him find out for himself
that Bucknell is dedicated to turn-
ing out the whole and wholesome
man and woman and not just the
ivy-hall sheltered ‘‘academic-idiot.”
The visit may do him some good.
Besides, the fresh air up there is
just delightful.

Sincerely yours,
M. L. Resnick, 0.D.

Polled Parents Perplexed about Present

24 Hour Open Dorm Policy Problems

By LINDA ANNE CAPUTO

College students are constantly
plagued with various types of opin-
ion polls.

This weekend the harassed stu-
dentes were given a respite as a
question poll was directed to par-
ents.

The subject of this inquiry was
the following question: What do you
think of the issue of twenty-four
hour open dorms presently under
discussion in House Council?

It is interesting to note that
opinions were evenly split on this
issue.

Although no parent interviewed
immediately responded affirmative-
ly, many decided that their sons
and daughters were capable of
handling the freedom and responsi-
bility that twenty-four hour open
dorms would entail.

Likewise, few fathers retorted
with a curt puritanical, “I’m
against it.’ Most disapproving par-
ents seem to think that they could
resign themselves to favor the mo-
tion if it were passed.

Most pro responses ressembled
the following replies:

“Certainly, I have no objections
if they behave themselves.’’

“T need more time to evaluate it
put I’d say yes. It is up to the in-
dividual.”

“Tl leave it up to my daughter
to decide.”

“Definitely, but only to upper-
classmen.””

“Sure, why not.”

The con responses stemmed from
the fact that most parents thought
extended open dorms would deprive
the student of his privacy:

“I think you need some restricted

times for your personal business. I
think you should try what you have
now.”

“No, I don’t think I’d approve be-
cause I’m an old fashioned parent.”

“Ym against it because I feel
one needs a set of rules in any
organization.”

“Tt’s not necessary for the sake
of privacy.”

“T don’t think it is right. Why?
I'm a parent-it leads to things. I
would say no for the entire com-
munity.”

“Pm against it for it would pro-
mote noise and confusion and might

disrupt any opportunity for study.”
It should be emphasized that those
who disapproved of this proposal
did so because they felt that the
policy of twenty-four hour open
dorms should not be extended to
the freshman dorms.

Many felt that it should only. be
an upperclass privilege.

Even though the terms of this
proposal were indefinite and it was
a new issue set before the parents,
perhaps at an inopportune time,
it is encouraging to note that par-
ental support for twenty-four hour
open dorms is relatively high.

speaks and how others see and
speak.

Again the student sees a differ-
ence between himself and others,
this time a silence.

But the emptiness in which the
student finds himself has a “‘range
of alternatives” and the silence is
one “that asks.’’

The professor draws the student
out of his habitual, predictable ex-
istence into an emptiness and si-
lence where things are not so pre-
dictable.

In this unpredictable situation the
student learns - he is enabled to
see the possible, to evaluate, and
to choose.

This is the essence of education,
seeing what is possible and is
necessary.

Therefore when the student asks
“who am I’ he sees an anon-
ymity between himself and what
he could be. He then goes on to ask
what it is valuable to be, and this
is the other part of education.

Education gives the student the
opportunity to appropriate space,
hearing and speaking, and himself
in his own way.

Or as Dr. Kirkland put it, “The
freight of the verb in ‘‘what you
can get’ is not ‘get’? but “can,”
and $3,700 is a bargain basement
price.”

Gettysburg Bows to Herd

In Tense, Overtime Battle

By BOB WENDEL

From the pre-game statistics for
the Bisons and the Bullets, it should
have been an easy game for Rey-
nold’s booters, but instead, the
Bisons had to go into overtime to
finally win the game, 1-0.

In the words of Coach Reynolds,
“We were up against a fired up
Gettysburg team. They had just
come off a 1-1 tie with top ranked
Delaware, and obviously felt they
could beat us if they played ag-
gressive ball.”

aggressively they did, and

held the Bisons to a 0-0

in regulation play. However,

Reynolds felt that, ‘we definitely

outplayed them, however we were

not able to capitalize on their mis-
cues.”

One of the most obvious of these
opportunities occurred in the second
quarter as Glenn Mars had a pen-
alty kick, and shot the ball directly
at the goalie.

On two other occasions in the
third quarter, shots by captain
Mars hit the crossbar of the goal,
and later in the fourth period, a
shot by Mars again went directly
to the goalie.

Even with the superior play ex-
hibited by Reynolds’ squad, Get-
tysburg could easily have won the
game. There was one very big
play in the second quarter which
could have decided the game.

The Bullets were awarded a di-
rect kick from just outside the
penalty area, to the left of the B.U.
goalie. The kick didn’t score, but
on the rebound, the ball went into
heavy traffic right in front of the
goal. The goalie who was partially
out of the goal, and _ partially

ned was out of the play, and

he ball was slowly rolling into

the net, halfback Tom Cronin clear-
ed it out. At that point the ball was
only six inches from the goal-line.

With the game notched at 0-0, the

It was a very hard fought match
as the two teams were pretty equal-
jy matched. Neither team showed
a great deal of scoring potential,
as far as an attack was concerned,
as most of the scoring came on
corner kicks, and long throw-ins.

In fact, all of the LCA scores
came as a result of corner shots,
and two of the KS goals came on
long throw-ins by Bill Fifield, which
were tipped in for the scores

utes were completely dominated by
the Herd, and it was during the
first period that B.U. scored the
winning goal.

In actuality the score was due to
a Gettysburg miscue, rather than
an organized play on the part of
the Bison line.

The ball was in the Gettysburg
end and a Bullet defenseman chose
to kick the ball back to his goalie
rather than clear the ball himself.
However the kick was weak, and
the goalie was hesitant about com-
ing out to get the ball.

Seeing that Glenn Mars was run-
ning for the ball, the goalie finally
did come out but too late. Both
players reached the ball about the
same time, but Mars was able to
get off a shot, and it found its way
into the net.

In commenting on the play Rey-
nolds stated, “I felt it was a very
good ball game. The Bullets played

Bisons Squeeze Leopards;
Scarlet Knights Next Foe

By KEN DOAK

The Bisons eked out a 30-28 win
over Lafayette Saturday, as John
Ondraski intercepted a last-minute
two-point conversion attempt to lock
up the victory.

For the third year in a row, BU
defeated the Leopards by a margin
of three points or less.

BU displayed a strong ground
attack, as the offensive line did an
excellent job. Sophomore Rich Diez
led the way with 155 yards in 28
carries.

Reversing their season-long pat-
tern, the Herd showed a potent
first half offense and dominated the
first 30 minutes.

The first TD drive was set up by
Tom Connolly’s recovery of a fum-
bled punt.

very good defense, and we were un-
able to get off the real good shot.
It was a very hard-hitting game as
well, and in fact, it almost got out
of hand. However, in general I was
pleased with our playing.

Reynolds cited fullbacks Larry
Greenwood and Mike Novak, and
lineman Glenn Mars for excellent
play.

Judging from the MAC games
played to date, there seems to be
little difference in the quality of the
teams in the western division. And

The next time they had the ball
the Bisons drove 78 yards for a
score, sparked by strong running
by Diez and Giacomelli. “Jock”

The Leopards came back with a

fenders near the sideline before

Frosh Upend Bullets;
Clash with Engineers

By ALAN GROCHAL

An early 20-0 lead stood up as the
freshman football team beat Get-
tysburg 26-12, last Friday, for their
third victory in five games.

Frosh Coach Bill Lane had special
praise for the defensive unit and
singled out the defensive backfield
for holding Gettysburg’s two split
ends to only two receptions.

“Offensively Carl Probst, our
quarterback, was just outstanding.
Also, Paul Perlik and Jim Gregor,
the running backs, had a fine
game,” he said.

“T think we beat a pretty good
team. Those guys had beaten La-
fayette earlier,”’ he added.

The Baby Bisons scored first in
the game on a quarterback sneak
by Probst. This touchdown was set
up on a long pass to end Joe Ber-

Gettysburg closed the gap to 20-

iced the contest.

Coach Lane heaped additional
praise on the defensive line of Tom
Denne, Frank Torok, Scott Car-
lisle, Mark Nosal, and Kevin Rhone.

“Tm very well pleased with the
overall improvement of the team.
They’ve come a long way since the
Cornell game. Next week we have

of themselves.””

The Bisons failed to capitalize on
two second quarter threats, as
fourth-down plays failed at the 14
and 16 yard lines.

They upped the halftime margin
to 15-3, as power running by Diez
moved the ball to the 10, and Boyer
then booted a 27 yard FG.

The Herd took the second half
kickoff, and quickly drove 72 yards
on the ground. Diez sliced off left
tackle for a 4 yard score, and the
kick made it 22-3.

The margin was soon cut to 22-10,
however. First, wingback Bob Don-
ofrio broke a sideline pass for 41
yards. He picked up 20 more yards
on a counter play, and a 9 yard
slant-in pass to Nowell was good
for the TD.

Early in the fourth quarter Mc-
Kay's passing sparked a 90 yard
scoring drive, as he threw the final
9 yards to Pete Tonks. However
the PAT was wide.

President Charles H. Watts II dis-

Watts Relates Finances to Federal Policies

News Analysis
By PAUL OSHER

Charles H. Watts II, president of
the University, expressed grave
concern over the financial straits
of the University and the status of
higher education in the U.S. in an
interview with .The Bucknellian
this week.

The University’s economic situa-
tion is marked by a $300,000 deficit
for the 1969-70 as well as a pro-
jected budgetary deficit over the
next four years. As a result the
University will be forced to re-
consider its priorities on the alloca-
tion of unds in the near future. The
shortage of funds will have far-
reaching effects on the University’s

AAUP Cites

Salary Gap,

Discusses Student Rights

By SUE HELM

Dr. John Peeler, assistant pro-
fessor of political science and Presi-
dent of the American Association of
University Professors, released a
report which stated that the Uni-
versity’s female professors receive
a lower salary than male profes-
sors.

The report indicated that this
fact was evident at all levels on
the University’s pay scale and Pro-
fessor Peeler said later, ‘‘The re-
port also shows that a. woman is
likely to receive the lowest salary

*« possible at any position.”

The AAUP decided that these in-
eqquities should be investigated
further so that the AAUP can make
a positive suggestion on the Uni-
versity’s salary policy.

The report included a listing of
the salaries of non-professional per-
sonnel -  stenographers, clerks,
maids, and janitors. Professor Pe-
eler stated, ‘‘The non-professionals’
salaries are believed to be com-
petitive with the small business in
the area, but not with the larger
industries,”

Academic freedom was the next
area of concern at the meeting.
From a questionaire, Congress ‘Un-
american Activities Committee
composed a list of 60 persons of a
subversive nature who had spoken
on college campuses. It was noted
that one or two of the speakers had
been here in the past year.

The AAUP felt that they would
look askance at cooperation with
such surveys, which interfere with

‘ academic freedom. It was felt that
if the government wanted such in-
formation in the public domain,
they should send an employee to
check the files.

A government questionnaire was

sent to libraries requesting a list
of the names of the people who had
checked out books on exxplosives.
The University’s chapter of the
AAUP agreed with the Pennsyl-
vania Association of Libraries that
such a questionnaire was an in-
vasion of privacy. Few libraries in
Pennsylvania complied with it.
The State of Pennsylvania re-
quested that all colleges and uni-
versities supply a list of the names
of campus activists or lose their
state scholarship funds..Bryn Mawr
and Haverford refused to comply,
and many other universities are
withdrawing their cooperation.
The AAUP felt that such a list

grams.

“Formerly,” Watts said, “we
lived within an expansionist evon-
omy where the University could de-
velop new programs by supplement-
ing the already existing ones. Ad-
dition was the rule. Now, we are
required to adapt to a new system:
a closed one.”

This system necessitates the re-
evaluation of University expendi-
tures in order to remain solvent.

Some programs within the Uni-
versity will be cut-back, some may
be eliminated. Such decisions will
not come easily, and Watts does
not minimize the problems that are
expected to arise.

“We haven't yet developed the
means or attitudes by which we

can make decisions within this
closed system.

These decisions will depend upon
our ability to quantify things that
resist quantification,” he said, ‘‘and
we’re not used to making those
kinds of choices.”

The important questions that must
be asked are what areas of the Uni-
versity budget will be scrutinized
and how will the financial decision

made. Also, what criteria do we
use to evaluate the various pro-
grams within the University?

Watts points out that he doesn’t
have the answers yet.

“For example, if we choose pro-
ductivity as one of our criterias,
how does one measure it? By the
number of people in an academic

department, by the scholarly sig-
nificance of the department? Cer-
tain forms of instruction cost more
than others and we must resist the
temptation to cut out the expensive
ones,’ he continued, “‘just because
they are expensive.” “There are
no areas that are sacrosanct,” he
noted, ‘from athletics to the li-
brary.”

The machinery by which the de-
cisions will be made is being set in
motion even now. The Board of
Trustees is initiating more precise
studies of University costs to ac-
cumulate the necessary data.

The sources of funds for the Uni-
versity’s coffers are few and fickle.
The state of Pennsylvania is not

Dr. David Pearson Receives
Biology Professorship Award

The Herbert Spencer Professor-
ship in Biology, established by a
grant of $100,000 from the Samuel
H. Kress Foundation, has been
awarded to Dr. David D. Pearson,

» Assistant Professor of Biology here.

Herbert Spencer was President of
the University from 1945 to 1949
and he was Executive Director of
the Samuel H. Kress Foundation
from 1949 until his death in 1960.

The Spencer Professorship per-
mits the development and adminis-
tration of cooperative programs be-
tween the University and the In-
stitute for Medical Education and
Research of the Geisinger Medical
Center.

In his new position, Dr. Pear-
son will devote part of his time to

consulting on programs of research

at the Institute for Medical Educa-
tion and Research and the remain-
der of his time to teaching and re-
search in biology. He also will serve
as a liason in educational affairs
between the Institute and the Uni-
versity.

Dr. Pearson received a bachelor
of arts degree from the University
of Connecticut in 1960 and a doctor-
ate in biology from the University
of Kansas in 1965.

He served as a lecturer in biology
at the University of Kansas in 1965-
66.

Immunobiology and biochemistry
are Dr. Pearson’s special interests
in. biology and he has published
several articles on immune systems
in reptiles and mammals.

importance of keeping the material
relevant to the courses.

Fourty-nine per cent of the stu-
dents feel more universal treatment
of Black culture is ‘‘necessary to
their academic experience.’’ A ma-
jority of the faculty members would
welcome “consultation and/or as-
sistance for a black student or a
black faculty consultant in enrich-
ing their courses.”

According to the faculty, 32 out
of 55 ‘“‘offer or plan to offer courses
in which emphasis on relevant con-
tributions, experiences or problems
of the black race in America could
be made.”’ Twenty-five of them now
include such emphasis in their
courses, and 20 would “‘consider
adding appropriate emphasis to
courses.”

Of the students, 32% have al-
ready studied some aspects of black
civilization, though nearly 1/3 of
these people were referring to high
school study programs or individual
experiences.

Most got their knowledge from
reading, discussions and lectures.
Only one person mentioned having

Johnson Discusses
War Crime Policy

“War crimes are the only facet of
the Vietnamese War which can’t be
resolved by the government,” and
once the high ranking military and
civilian leaders responsible for
them are exposed, the war will be
ended.

This was the gist of the argument
presented by ex-captain Robert

people Tuesday night.

Capt. Johnson is a graduate of

ABS Opposes Gym Requirement

By SUE PRESTON

At its Wednesday night meeting,
the Association of Bucknell Students
passed a resolution to abolish the
physical education requirement in
the College of Arts and Sciences,
and the College of Engineering, by
a vote of 19-2.

The motion, sponsored by Bob
Nachshin, Russ Pais, Steve Meil-
lJeur and Beth Wright, asks that the
requirement be changed as of
September 1, 1971 “to permit each
student to choose his own physical
fitness program without having the
college require physical education
for graduation.”

It went on to state, “the ABS
realizes the importance of physical
education, but believes thai each
student should have a freedom of
whether or not to take physical
education courses.”

In the debate which preceded the
vote, Mike Holoszyc LUR alternate,
pointed out that more activities
and better instruction could be pro-
vided by cutting down on the num-
ber of students in physical educa-
tion classes.

A question was raised whether

credit should still be given under
this new plan and whether it will
mean cutting down the number of
faculty members in this depart-
ment.

Bob Nachshin, ABS treesurer, co-
sponsor of the ABS passed resolu-
tion to ask both colleges of the Uni-
versity to do away with the physical
education requirement for fresh-
men and sophomores.

(photo by Ed Marston)

Mary Helen Layton, parlimentar-
ian, responded to the first question
saying, “To some people physical
education is an art, a committment
to excellence. I think it should be
given as much credit as academic
courses. I feel we should also sup-
plement this notion with some con-
structive suggestions for this de-
partment.”

In regard to the second question,
Jim Ludwig, LUR representative,
said that by decreasing teachers,
the department would lose any di-
versity it has now.

The Association of Bucknell Stu-
dents met as a committee of the
whole again, to discuss what ap-
proach it should use in regarding
the Senate document. Next week
it will go into formal session.

From now on ABS meetings will
begin at 7 p.m. The regular meet-
ing will last for one hour followed
by a Senate session. Amendments
to be proposed at these meeting
must be received by Lou Bucceri
no later than Sunday night. Stu-
dents desiring to propose an amend-
ment are urged to contact an ABS
member to sponsor it.

Ecology

“The best place to defend the earth

of the sewage system of the borough of

is wherever you happen to be.” We heard
that phrase a lot last year when ecology
was an important issue. Since then, the
fight to save our environment has been
dismissed as just another trite issue, like
civil rights and peace politics. But the
fact remains that we are facing the im-
minent destruction of our environment,
and we must take additional steps to save
what is left of it.

Everyday the University collects
and burns huge amounts of paper. This
substantial contribution to air pollution
could be discontinued through recycling
of the refuse paper. The recycling of
paper also provides another source of
paper other than that produced from
the pulp of freshly cut trees. There are
companies in this area which purchase
used paper, and the University should

that a recycling plan can be formulated.
Tf we were to undertake such a recycling
program, we could then look into the
feasibility of recycling what amounts of
glass and metal we use.

grade.

The Frosh and AWS

Once again, and hopefully for the last time, the
Bucknellian feels it necessary to focus its attention on
the regulatory jurisdiction of the Associated Women’s
Students over freshman curfews. We vigorously support
the movement to abolish freshman curfews, thereby
climinating the boundaries placed on the development
process of the freshmen woman.

Of course, the AWS “is really busy now” (plan-
ning shopping trips and other al” matters) and will
have to postpone action on the curfew issue. Freshman
women may ask themselves what it is about the AWS
that keeps its calendar so full. If the AWS relinquishes
‘urisdiction over freshman curfews, the ramifications
will be astounding.

Freshman girls will become college women (of
course, they will have to think of other ways of avoiding
honesty with their dates) .In loco parentis will have re-
located. Maturity and individual personal responsibility
will be entrusted to all students regardless of age or
sex).

Our only ho ; that all our attention to this mat-
ter has not lifted from its deserved obscurity into
a false position of eminence.

How about it, girls? How can we speak of a com-
munity of freedom and equality when we ourselves are
the oppressors ?

POLITICS ‘70

A Single Voice

By MIKE GUIER

Thirty-five Senate seats and thirty-five statehouses are at stake in
Tuesday’s elections. The prestige of the White House in local and state
races will be frequently discussed on Nov. 3. The results in various con-
tests may also serve as an indication of what to expect in 1972. The follow-
ing are my predictions:

In the Senate - spotlight race:

California - With help from Reagan, Republican George Murphy, the Sen-
ate’s “‘song-and-dance-and-little-else’’ man, should squeak by youth-
ful Rep. John Tunney.

Connecticut - Despite Rev. Joseph Duffey’s apparent lead in the polls. ’'ll
pick Rep. Weicker, the Republican. The presence of Senator Dodd
as an independent and Mr. Duffey’s chairmanship of ADA should
hurt the Democrat and make possible a slim victory for the more
moderate Mr. Weicker.

Florida - In spite of Mr. Nixon's efforts, Rep. William Cramer, a con-
servative Republican, should be defeated by a little-known Democrat,
Lawton Chiles. New faces seem to be popular in some southern
states this year.

Illinois - Adlai Stevenson III should unseat Republican Senator Ralph
Smith, the margin being determined largely by Mayor Daley’s
ability to get out the Chicago vote. A strange alliance.

Indiana - A few incumbents lose every time. Democrat Vance Hartke looks
like one of the unfortunates.

Maryland - Sen. Joseph Tydings was vulnerable this year, but Republican
Glenn Beall failed in his assigned task.

Minnesota - HHH should win easily over Rep. Clark MacGregor.

New Mexico - Democratic incumbent Joseph M. Montoya should barely
survive a major battle against conservative oilman-rancher Anderson
Carter. Montoya’s liberalism in not so popular in a rather conserv-
ative state.

New York-This one is almost impossible to call. Conservative James
Buckley leads the polls, but I'll pick Rep. Richard Ottinger. Despite
his dramatics, Charles Goodell should run third; Senator Goodell may
not even be a viable candidate. When they enter the voting booths,
most liberals and moderates will vote for a man who looks like a
potential winner.

North Dakota - The elections here usually hinge on the farmers. Liberal
Democrat Quentin Burdick holds a slight edge over Rep. Kleppe.
The situation could change overnight, but I'll stick with the incum-
bent.

Ohio - Aided by a strong gubernatorial candidate, Howard Metzenbaum
should defeat his Republican opponent, Robert Taft, Jr., by a small
margin.

Tennessee - This is my choice as the election of the year. Sen. Albert Gore
is the Number One target of the Republicans. Mr. Nixon hand-
picked Rep. William Brock to unseat the liberal Mr. Gore. Two
months ago, Brock looked like a sure victor. After all, Tennessee

Lewisburg. The primary sewage treat-
ment plant for the system has been
ordered by the state to upgrade itself
to the secondary treatment level. The
University should now consider its im-
pact on the treatment system and con-
sider the possibility of building its own
treatment plant, possibly of the tertiary

There are various other areas at
which the University should look at it-
self from the ecological perspective. We
must begin to consider the University as
an ecological system, taking into ac-
count what comes into the system and
what goes out of it. We should also con-
sider what we want the physical en-
vironment of the campus to be (do we
want parking lots or grassy quads?).
The University should at least organize
a community-wide committee to consider
these questions and should also commit
itself to action in this field. It is the
least that we can do and only the begin-
ning towards working for an environ-
ment in which man and nature work to-
gether instead of against each other.

CHOAD
To the Editor:

I'd like to adress the University
Community:

WAKE UP! Summer's over;
you're back on campus (or on cam-
pus for the first time); you’re con-
scious again. During the vacation,
you slept, and while you slept,
things have happened. And BE-
LIEVE YOU ME, they concern
YOU!

Some of you, having read this
far, are, no doubt, “turned off”
and saying to yourselves, ‘“‘Say,
what’s with this weirdo? Is he on
pot or something? Where’s his head
at? Is he on an ego trip or some-
thing?” Let me reassure you, if it
is an ego trip, it’s a collective one,
something that maybe YOU should
concern yourself with.

This is a critical period in your
life, not only academically and
sexually (!) but in other areas as
well. Seriously, your years in col-
lege, whether you know it or not,
are politically crucial ones. The
University offers the perfect op-
portunity to crystallize one’s ideas
and emotions and, by means of ex-
tending the university’s sphere of
influence throughout the immediate
area, arouse political sentiment,
shape it, and direct it to universally
desired ends in the most expedient
fashion. True, there will be dif-
ficulties. If life were all that simple,
what use would there be for poli-
tics? Hence, C.H.O.A.D.—the Cam-
pus Headquarters for Organized Ac-
tion against Decandence — one of
the many political forces on cam-
pus, the best, we think.

Let me explain CHOAD to you.
Like the words in the motto of the
4-H Club, each of the words in our
title means something: 1) Campus
—where you are, and where it’s at.
CHOAD aims to get you and it to-
gether. 2) Headquarters—While the
campus is “where it’s at” in a
universal sense, your head is
“where it’s at’’ on a smaller scale;
in other words, your head is a
microcosm of “where it’s at.”
Every universal needs in particular,
every macro- a microcosm, and,
as they say, every dog has his day.
While CHOAD headquarters is os-
tensibly myself and several col-
leagues on the higher eschelon, it
is at the same time (metaphorically
speaking) each of one of your par-
ticular heads. 3) for is a preposi-
tion 4) Organized — I’ve already
spoken of a collective spirit. We
cannot have anarchy. Nor can we
afford despotism. My colleagues
and I on the higher eschelon real-
ize this and so forbid anarchy and
despotism. Our effort is a ‘‘to-
gether” thing, a democratic venture
which requires the utmost disci-
pline and responsibility from its
members. A house divided against
itself cannot stand; anarchy, like
the plague, breeds rats; despotism,
like a rat, breeds incestuously, un-
til the royal family, in degenerate
shame, is overthrown by the people
(us). CHOAD throbs onward and up-
ward like a powerful moonship.
CHOAD will succeed because CHO-

Letters to the Editor

AD has ‘“‘got it on!” 5) Action —
This doesn’t mean sitting around!
Action is perhaps CHOAD’s most
esteemed principle. It was a word
carefully chosen to be a part of
our group’s calling card. CHOAD
moves; CHOAD is kinetic; CHOAD
gets things done; CHAOD comes
when you need it. 6) Against — We
take a definite stand. We rise
against 7) Decadence — This word,
too, was carefully chosen. It repre-
sents those elements against which
CHOAD rises — the sloath and de-
cay of life, not only throughout the
nation’s political institutions, but
throughout its social and religious
institutions as well. CHOAD feels
that this decadence in the national
character is bad enough, but is
outraged that it should be allowed
to exist right under our noses, right
here on the campus of B.U.

Here’s where YOU fit in: CHOAD
asks that you examine both your
surroundings and yourself. Are you
an element of decadence? Are you
static? Indifferent? Are you one of
those few who would rather sit
around in the dorm in a small,
dark room, getting stoned, listen-
ing to the Mothers of Invention,
gazing insanely at surrealist paint-
ings and masturbating, than change
yourself and the world, elevating
your state of being? Would you
rather “cop out’? than “tune in’
on what is happening in the real
world and “turn yourself on’ to
life? I'm not speaking exclusively
to the dope fiend, but to those who
are addicted to any kind of stagna-
tion, self-abuse, or the abuse of
others. To you, I make an offer:
join us and experience life! Join
CHOAD — you can’t beat it.

Now. What does CHOAD do? Let
me give you some facts:

item: CHOAD participates in can-
vassing during times in which our
nation is especially threatened by
decadence. CHOAD members speak
to townspeople. We look at it this
way: Let’s talk to the citizens of
Lewisburg. Sure. They might be a
little narrow-minded. But CHOAD
helps to spread enlightenment after
the example of St. Peter. Let’s
reason with the Lewisburgers. No
one’s mind was ever changed with-
out help. Let’s present them with
the truth, the irresistible truth. And,
no one’s mind was ever changed
overnight. CHOAD is persistent,
CHOAD is active 24 hours a day.

item: CHOAD helps to sponsor
stimulating speakers, like Herman
|. Schneebeli. During last year’s
Moratorium, Mr. Schneebeli ap-
peared on campus to discuss Presi-
dent Nixon’s Cambodian incursion
(fiasco). CHOAD prodded Mr.
Schneebeli and spoke of him while
canvassing. CHOAD advised towns-
people to write letters to Mr.
Schneebeli. We felt that such action
would be an effective way to
change Mr. Schneebeli’s person-
ality and manner of thinking, and
even more important, his vote.

item: CHOAD’s archives are
stocked with first stencils, peace
sign stencils (those are buggers to
make!), moratorium buttons (now,
incidently, collectors’ pieces), and

the like. All items in the archives
are available for use by any cam-
pus organization dedicated to CH-
OAD’s goals

item: CHOAD members frequent-
ly participate in demonstrations.
Through such forms of protest, we
take our stand and flaunt it. We
feel that demonstration leads to
meaningful dialogue. Although our
past record is rather dull in the
area of demonstration, we hope to
have at least a handful of martyrs
for the coming academic year.

item: CHOAD was partly respon-
sible for establishing B.U. as the
national headquarters for the Soda
Boycott last spring. Many CHOAD
members, yours truly included,
helped to construct a soda-can
replica on the quad. We felt that the
replica served quite effectively as
an object of scorn. Many students
sacrificed eagerly caches of soda
for the occasion. (By the way, we’d
like to thank those students. En-
joyed the soda thoroughly! — Just
kidding; we find that humor, at
times, helps one to “‘hide the tears”
as it were).

item: CHOAD cares!!

Now: What can you do for
CHOAD? Simple. Come to the in-
formal meetings — come one, come
all! If you’ve got something on
your chest, get it off, and help
CHOAD ‘‘get it on!’ We look for-
ward to an increased membership.
Help us carry last year’s momen-
tum to greater Lewisburg, then on
to West Milton, Montandon, Dan-
ville, Selinsgrove, and Sunbury!
CHOAD stands ready to make a
contribution to the whole of society.
CHOAD challenges YOU: What's
in YOUR head? — and — Is YOUR
head ‘‘where it’s at?” Right on!

Humbly,
Joe Beates

Black Study

(Continued from Page 1)
sarticularly noted for their lack of
black coverage were the same men-
tioned above, as well as music and
art

Many suggestions were given to
implement a black studies program.
Besides enriching existing courses,
students proposed starting e sep-
arate black studies course (or
courses), bringing in guest lecturers
and black professa increasing
the University’s black population
and contact between whites and
blacks. Some thought more atten-
tion should be given to ‘‘all minor-
ity groups,” some preferred to
“study man rather than his color.”
Others considered starting a black
studies department, or possibly “‘ed-
ueating the professors?”

A few felt that “too much em
phasis is being placed on black
studies programs, or that college is
too late to begin these programs.’
Some noted that it must remain the
individual’s perogative to study or
not study the black situation.

The Committee on Afro-American
Studies has met with a number of
departments to raise the question
of filling next year’s vacancies with
black professors. It is also hoping
that the University will hire a black
faculty member specifically as co-
ordinator or consultant on a black
studies program.

Powers spoke of publishing (with
the permission of the respective in-
saructors) a list of courses which
already attend to blacks and their
culture, or to have individual de-
partments note such studies in
their own course descriptions.

‘Sometimes-concrete, Sometimes philosophical’
Interview Depicts Gardner’s Frankness in Discussion

By DAVID HAMMER

The subject of this week’s inter-
view is James E. Gardner, assistant
professor of religion and University
Chaplain. In sometimes-concrete,
sometimes-philosophical language,
Gardner openly on the
nature of love, his favorite theolo-
gians, religious imagery in folk and
reck music, and his own theological
background. Throughout, what is
evident is Gardner’s ability to speak
with students, and it is with his de-
sire to discuss problems with them

that this interview opens.

Harmon’s
Forecast

It’s that time of the season when
we feel we should remind readers
that our weekly ratings of the Top
Twenty Teams are based on a
team’s power quotient, mot on
games won and lost, nor on per-
sonal opinion.

The power quotient itself is based
on an average of how well a team
does against all opposition . . in
other words, it’s a past perform-
ance rating. Each of the 640 foot-
ball teams we follow receives an
adjusted rating each week. These
twenty, then, in our opinion, are the
most powerful football teams in
the nation - this week!

This explains why a team’s po-
sition in the Top 20 might fluctuate
from week to week even though it
remains undefeated. It must main-
tain its expected level of power.

For example, the Air Force and
Arizona State are both undefeated.
However, the average of their per-
formances each week does not place
them among the top five or even
among the top ten.

Their resulting power quotients
would rate them as underdogs
against many of the top teams.

Many letter-writers feel that when

“a team has been beaten a couple of

times, it should be dropped from
any ranking. In some national rat-
ings, this happens.

We maintain that many one, two,
and even three-time losers are
among the finest teams in the coun-
try, and should be rated according-
ly. Alabama and U.C.L.A., for ex-
ample, have been beaten three
times, but certainly are among the
top teams in the nation.

This is probably only a partial
answer to the many questions we
receive, asking why we still include

Gene Depew: Defens

By DAVE COULTER

When the thundering Herd clashes
against the opposition, helmet to
helmet, shoulder to shoulder, often
that weird shaped
bundle of air, seems to get most
of the attention.

The abilities of those who handle
the “pigskin,” thereby, seem to
rise naturally above the remainder
of the action. However, many of
the fiercest battles in the opening
and closing of holes goes unherald-
ed.

Co-captain Gene Depew of the
Bison defense is one of those men
who endures and enjoys this smash-
ing competition.

Gene began playing football with
the team at Juniata High School
in Mifflintown, Pa., where he was
a powerful fullback on their un-
defeated 1966 squad.

Although he admits that there is
not as much “glory’’ in playing on
the line, Gene has enthusiastically
adapted his talents to the left
tackle position.

The Bison co-captain sees coord-
ination and teamwork as essential
to the success of the defensive
squad. Gene explains that since
“we go to them instead of wait-
ing for them to come to us, prob-
Jems can arise if someone does
not cover the position vacated by
another player who is firing the
gap or shifting to another area.”

Therefore, if the team fails to
work together holes can open in the
defense.

The Bison defensive line has,

Gene sights with pride the poor
rushing record of the opposition
against the Blue line.

Although the 1970 Herd is some-
what smaller than in past seasons,
Gene reports that the “great at-
titude’ and ‘100% positive team
affort’” more than compensate for
any decrease in the number of in-
dividuals.

As a captain Gene feels an added
responsibility to try to “keep the
team together’ as they work to-
ward bettering their record.

He was “especially disappointed”’
in their losses this year, because
they were all so close. However,
Gene is more than ready to call

Cornell, St. Francis Play
In Bison Polo Invitational

By MARK KNODERER

This weekend the second annual
Bucknell Invitational Water Polo
Tournament will be held at the
Freas-Rooke natatorium.

The tournament promises to be a
great improvement over the first
invitational of last year.

Teams from Cornell, St. Francis
of New York, R.P.I., and Penn
State, as well as two Bison squads
will provide the action.

The first game starts at 10:00
am. Saturday morning and pits
Cornell against the Bucknell ‘‘B”
team.

Games will continue all day, and
will conclude around 8:30 Saturday
night

The semifinals will be played
Sunday morning at 10:00 a.m., and
the finals at 2:00 p.m

The water polo club took its
lumps last weekend, as they were
defeated by Yale twice and Army
once, and scrambled to a win over
St. Francis of New York. They get

for the team in the remainder of
the season

After school the Bison co-captain
hopes to continue to play ball or to
become a coach and maybe to
watch his younger brother, now a
B.U .sophomore running bé k, as
he develops.

Football is obviously number one
with Gene and he looks with deter-
mination toward the upcoming
games with Rutgers and Colgate.
As the Bisons fight to fulfill their
hopes this season, every football
fan can be assured that the Bison
co-captain will be giving his all to
the team.

a chance to redeem themselves in
the BU Invitational this weekend.

In the dual match with Yale “A”
team on Friday, the Bisons dis-
covered that the big boys were
also physical boys. The Eli com-
mitted fouls, nearly doubling the
Bison’s 17, but with their great
depth, the replacements were as
good as the first string.

Yale could also score many goals,
as every man on their team was
very proficient at shooting. Six
players for Yale scored two or
more goals, topped by Jim Den-
vir’s nine.

The Bisons were game, however,
and trailed only 11-9 at halftime.
They were blanked 6-0 in the third
period, as Yale moved out to a
commanding lead. The offense
perked up again in the fourth quart-
er to make the final score 22-12.

In the tournament on Saturday,
the first opponent was Army, and
the Cadets prevailed, 14-5. The Bi-
sons played defensive ball, but as
a result could not score themselves.
Paul Landes pumped in five goals
but received no offensive support.

Army ace Steve Jackson outscor-
ed the whole club, as he scored six
raising his two-game total
against the Bisons to fifteen.

The next opponent was Yale. The
Bisons stuck to their defensive tac-
tics and held the Eli to twelve
goals, but still could find no of-
fensive punch. Frosh Steve Winings
scored two, and Peter O’Keeffe and
Landes scored one apiece, making
the score 12-4.

In the third round the Bisons
faced St. Francis and came up with
a victory. The club swept to a 5-0

goals,

lead in the first quarter, and held
off the Cardinals the rest of the
way to win, 11-6.

Landes scored five goals, O’Keef-
fe two, and Winings, Dyke Ed-
wards, Bob Richards, and Dean
Hunt one apiece.

The clubs log now stands at 2-5,
not including non-league triumphs
over R.P.I. and Penn State.

Leopards Beware!
Booters Edge Crusaders

By BOB WENDEL

Coach Craig Reynolds’ soccer
squad notched its fifth win against
one defeat and a tie, as it squeaked
by Susquehanna, 1-0, as freshman
lineman Philip Campbell, scored
the only goal on a head shot.

“The boys looked very shoddy
during the first quarter, as Sus-
quehanna had many scoring op-
portunities, but due to the excel-
Jent play of both Larry Greenwood
and Lloyd Ryysylainen they were
unable to score,’ the coach com-
mented.

Reynolds went on to say that the
first period was the only period
Susquehanna was able to put any
real pressure on the goalie as his
team dominated the rest of the ball
game.

“The second quarter we dominat-
ed completely, and in fact it was
in this period that we scored our
goal. It came on a very nice play.

We were awarded a corner kick,
and Glenn Mars lofted a perfect
chip directly in front of the goal,
and Campbell headed the ball per-
fectly.”

The soccer mentor explained that
his team also went on to control
the second half, and the only
trouble the team had was with one
especially tall inside lineman

However, he stated that junior
fullback Larry Greenwood outhead-
ed him throughout the game, and
thereby nullified his effectiveness.

Once again, the teams’ basic
problem was scoring. Even though
the team has won over 70% of its
games, it has only outscored its
opponents 15-8. Coach Reynolds
feels that this in part is due to the
relatively short time the line has
been playing together, however,
more so because the team as a
whole still not using its wings
as effectively as it could.

“We are trying to force the ball
down the middle too much, and
consequently, we're not getting off
as many good shots as we should.”

Concerning this weekends game
with Lafayette, Reynolds explained
that although the Leopards record
isn’t outstanding, they have been
playing some very difficult teams
out of the conference, and could be
very well prepared for his booters.

He commented that in the game
two years ago, (the last time B.U.
played them at Easton), the Bisons

outplayed the Pards, but lost 1-0.

Last year the Bisons defeated the
Leopards 3-1, but as Reynolds ex-
plains it, “The game was not as
close as the score would seem to
indicate, and I expect a very tough
game.”

Another reason for the mentor’s
cautious attitude is due to the re-
cent loss of sophomore lineman Joe
Steinmetz, who will be out for the
year with a broken foot.

The importance of this game is
obvious—if B.U. loses, they must
beat Delaware to win the division,
but if the Bisons win, they neea
only tie Delaware for the title.

Reynolds also released his choices
for soccer player of the week for
the last two weeks—Glenn Mars
winning the distinction last week,
while Larry Greenwood received
the honor this week.

The Rusty Knights

Bisons Challenge Rutgers;
Gilewicz Returns to Action

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

One of the biggest mysteries this
fall season is the failure of Rutger’s
football team.

The Scarlet Knights had been
predicted to have one of their best
seasons in a long time, but the
superlatives started dropping off
after the first game of the season
when they slaughtered Lafayette 41-
16.

Since then the Knights have lost
five games in a row.

Head football coach Fred Prender
still retains some of the early sea-
son accolades, “Early this season
we figured that Rutgers would be
one of our three toughest opponents
and I still think they will be. They
have fine personnel; they’re just a
sleeping giant.”

The Knights do have excellent
personnel on paper. They possess
two big and fast backs in Steve
Ferrughelli and Larry Robertson.

Ferrughelli at 6-2 and 228 is Rut-
ger’s workhorse at fullback. He has
slammed for 253 yards in 68 carries
so far this season.

Larry Robertson is expected to be
able to play after being injured
against Columbia. The speedy tail-
back is averaging 4.3 yards per
carry for a total of 232 yards.

The Knights possess a capable

Bisonettes Down Messiah

To Conclude

By STEPH LAUDENBACH

The Bisonettes ended their 1970
season Wednesday with a win over
Messiah, 3-0.

The game followed a loss to Blo-
omsburg last week, in which the
girls were defeated 2-0. Both games
were away.

Kathy Kellog (left wing) and Jill
Schlichter (right inner) opened the
Messiah game with good cross field
passing. Fullbacks Marji Janda and
Peggy Wilhem provided good de-
fense, while Sue Grant, Ronnie
Hilles, and Gina Ambrose scored
the three goals.

The Bisonettes had little trouble
with bunching since the Messiah
field is somewhat smaller than
the girls have been used to, ac-
cording to Coach Marjorie Peck.

In addition to the regular season
games, the girls scrimmaged with
the Center County Club Team Par-

The Bisonettes felt that this was

Having ended their season with
a 3-2-1 record, the girls are looking
forward to the Susquehanna Field

While the Bisonettes will play as

Players of the Week

Don Giacomelli

The Bison football staff has se-
lected four players of the week for
outstanding performances in the Bi-
sons’ 30-28 victory over Lafayette
last Saturday.

Recipients of the awards, given
by the Lewisburg Touchdown Club
at its weekly luncheon, were offen-
sive players Art Wilkins and Don
Giacomelli, and defensive players
John Hertzler and Gene Luccarelli.

Wilkins, a junior is an award win-
ner for the second time this season.
He was also honored after the
Davidson game. The 5-10, 195-pound
guard received an excellent film
grade by the football coaches. He
was one of the keys to the Bisons
gaining 280 yards on the ground.

Wilkins was considered by Head

Coach Fred Prender as being in on
five big plays.

Giacomelli, senior co-captain,
played a tremendous all-around
game. The 6-2, 195-pound halfback
carried the ball 23 times for 67
yards and scored on a four-yard
run.

Giacomelli caught three passes
for 26 yards, including a 14-yard
TD aerial from quarterback Howie
Burke.

He was also cited by Coach Pren-
der for putting in a strong blocking
game.

Hertzler, a junior, played his best
game ever in a BU uniform. The
6-1, 210-pound defensive end made
nine tackles and sacked the quarter-
back three times.

Luccarelli, a senior, was in on
six tackles and he intercepted two
passes from his defensive safety
position. The 5-9, 175-pounder ran
one interception back for a touch-
down, but it was nulified because
of a clipping penalty.

Luccarelli has 128 yards in inter-
ception returns this season break-
ing the Bison record of 108 set in
1952 by Stan utterworth.

He has seven thefts this season, ,
just two short of the all-time mark,
and his 15 interceptions for a career
ties Butterworth’s career record.

Coach Prender said, “It was a

quarterback in Mike Yancheff. The
junior has passed for 596 yards so
far this season, but with 10 big in-
terceptions.

Yancheff has capable receivers
in flanker Al Fenstemacher and Bob
Shutte. Fenstemacher is the team’s
leading receiver despite a sore frac-
tured finger.

The Kinght quarterback is sure to
test the Bison’s secondary and
much of his success this season has
come from throwing short flare
passes to his backs, especially Fer-
rughelli, and his tight end Jim
Fallon at 6-5 provides a big target
in a crowd.

Prender is glad to have Paul
Gilewicz back in his defensive

—a—

secondary but in an effort to bolster
his forces there he has shifted Greg
Doviak to safety also. Doviak has
been working hard all week and is
ready to play if needed.

Offensively, Prender
start the same offensive unit that
has been so successful in the past
few weeks.

Rutgers has suffered key injuries
all year but now they appear to be
in fine shape to provide stiff com-
petition for the Big Blue. Their
younger players have gained much
experience and some veterans have
returned to their lineup. For the
seventh week in a row it looks like
the Thundering Herd will have an-
other tough game.

Davis Gym Swings
To Sebastian Style

By DEAN LANDEW

One of the marks of a good
musician is his “lasting power.”
Sebastian has it. I never realized
how good his Lovin’ Spoonful songs
were (I mean, are) until he did
them over at the concert. In fact,
“Daydream,” ‘Lovin’ You,” and
“Darlin’ Be Home Soon” are e€x-
amples of songs that sound even
better now. Songs that we knew in
a younger day, before we came to
this University, before Kent and
Jackson, before we started taking
ourselves seriously.

This is not to say that we should
look at Sebastian’s performance in
terms of social revolution or poli-
tics. Not at all. What I mean to
say is that the songs we used to
groove to are now very soothing,
very real, and even very personal.
And Sebastian comes off all the
better for it.

Sebastian is charisma and humor
all over, not a balf-talent who must
rely on corny stage gimmicks. He
knows exactly how to feel his

Attorney William Kuntsler will

Kuntsler was the chief counsel
for the Chicago Conspiracy and is
currently representing the Kent

He has recently been a contro-

Kuntsler has said that a major
reason for his trip to central Pen-

Flower City Conspiracy now under
indictment in Rochester, New York
for the alleged destruction of draft
files, U.S. attorney files, and dis-
ruption of F.B.I. records.

Staff Attracts Talent
Music Admission Policy Changes

By ROBIN BITTERLICH

By a vote of 9 to 1, the faculty
Committee on Admissions has pas-
sed a four year experimental plan
proposed by Professor Thomas
Warner, Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Music.

According to this plan, “the Of-
fice of Admissions shall accept an-
nually into the Bachelor of Music
program between 6 and 8 students,
who under current admission cri-
teria would have little chance of
admittance.”

The Bachelor of Music degree
is different from the Bachelor of
Arts degree with a major in music.

Seniors Solicit Donations
For $125,000 Class (aft

By BILL WHITNEY

All Seniors will soon be personal-
ly contacted by a member of their
Class who will ask them to partici-
pate in the Class of 1971 Gift Pro-
gram.

Each Senior will be asked to
pledge an annual donation to the
Gift Program, which will be col-
lected each year for the next ten
years.

As the money is collected, it will
be invested in a mutual fund or
some other steady growth program.

Prior to the tenth reunion of the
Senior Class at which the gift will
be presented to the University, Gift
Program Chairman Jeff Sengstack
will give all participating mem-
bers the opportunity to vote on how
the money for the gift is to be
used.

The Gift Program is expected to
produce $125,000 at the 1981 ma-
turity.

As stated in the information book-
let, the ‘‘Senior Class Gift Program
is an opportunity for the Class of
1971 to help Bucknell to continue
and broaden its development.”

“Each Senior has hopefully re-
ceived something of value from
Bucknell over his years here.
Therefore each individual should
have his personal reason for con-
tributing to the program. The class
gift is the best opportunity for the
individual members of the Class of
1971 to work together to make a

Dateline: The Campus

By CATHLEEN EVANS

Indiana State University (Terre Haute) — The University Presi-
dent, Board of Trustees, administrators and students face a $61,847
Jawsuit for not taking the appropriate actions to calm campus dis-
order and protect state property during campus disorders in April
1970. The suit was filed by the State Attorney General.

Temple University has started a new political group, the Move-
ment for a New Congress (MNC), which is thought to ‘fit some-
where between the Young Democrats (YDs) and the Student Mobil-
ization Committee (SMC).” The Temple MNC is supporting Demo-
crats Milton Shapp and Ernest Kline, Harrison Williams for re-

election as Democratic U.S. Senat
Berger as U.S. Representative fr

tor from New Jersey, and Arthur
om York County. 400 chapters of

the MNC have been organized since it was formed at Princeton last

May.

University of Deleware - John E. Hocutt, on leave from his po-
sition as vice-president for student affairs, recommends that uni-
versities hire a “responsible professional journalist to work with
student publications,” feeling “The student newspaper is a problem
at most institutions.” He sees those institutions with departments
of journalism as those having fewest problems.

according to Sengstack.

The Gift Program is entirely stu-
dent run, All collections, invest-
ment decisions, and other adminis-
trative operations will be carried
out solely by members of the Senior
class.

The Senior class members will

arts schedule with nine to eleven
courses in music, whereas Bachelor
of Music students must take twenty
music courses and only twelve in
other areas. Thus, the experimental
program applies to those interested
in a “more professional degree
that requires a greater proficiency
in the skills in music, particularly
in performance.”

To be considered for this pro-
gram, the applicant must fulfill
six requirements: (1) have a com-
bined SAT score of at least 1025, (2)
rank in the upper 1/4 of his class,
(3) undergo a personal interview
and audition by the chairman of the
Department of Music and at least
one other member of the music
faculty, (4) receive on the basis of
the audition a rating of excellence
or superior in both musical pro-
ficiency and musical promis: 5)
be specifically recommended for
this exxperiment by the chairman
of the Department of Music. (6)
receive final approval from the Di-
rector of Admissions.”

According to Prof. Warner, there
is no attempt to lower the stand-
ards of acceptance: ‘“We don’t want
a bunch of dumb musicians-” The
limits set for SATs and class rank
are within those limits set by the
University. Instead, Prof. Warner
wishes the Admissions Office to
re-evaluate the importance of var-

ious factors normally used for ad-
mission and to consider the im-
portance of information gained by
the music department in their two
hour interview-audition with the
student.

In some cases, especially those in
which the student has spent con-
siderable time and effort develop-
ing exceptional musical talent,
Prof. Warner feels that SAT’s and
class rank do not properly reflect
the students’ ability and motiva-
tion.

A disadvantage to this proposal
noted by the Director of Admissions
is the possibility of the plan pro-
viding a loophole for inferior stu-
dents who would later change their
majors. However, Prof. Warner
feels that through the information
gained by the extensive question-
ing and observation during the au-
dition, he will be able to foresee
and prevent this poss: bility.

The program applies only to
those who are exceptionally talent-
ed and dedicated to the musical
field. Professor Candland, Cha
man of the Committee on Admis-
sions, also pointed out that a stu-

Passes Murphy’s Motion
Faculty Reviews Athletic Budget

By LINDA DIETRICK

At yesterday’s faculty meeting,
John V. Murphy, assistant profes-
sor of English, proposel that a de-
tailed study of the athletic program
budget be made in view of the Uni-
versity’s considerable financial def-
icit.

In addition to focusing on the
specific expenditures, the study
would also attempt to seek justi-
fication for them.

The total current budget for the
athletic program here is $571,000.
According to John F. Zeller, vice
president for business and finance,
this figure comprises all depart-
mental exxpenses, including faculty
salaries and gymnasium mainten-

ance, and does not account for in-
come which offsets it somewhat.

‘An alternate motion by Robert A.
Latour, associate professor of phy-
sical education, called for a more
comprehensive investigation ot the
total expenditures of all depart-
ments. The motion was defeated.

The faculty voted to turn the
Murphy resolution over to the Fac-
ulty Advisory Committee for
further consideration.

ABS president, Dave Lacy point-
ed out that since the students will
be affected by any changes that
are made, they should be repre-
sented in whatever action is taken.

In his opening remarks, Presi-
dent Charles H. Watts assured the

meeting that the $350,000 to $375,000
deficit will be absorbed, and that
no reduction in staff would be
necessary. Some vacant faculty po-
sitions, however , must remain un-
filled for the present.

Also, unlike other institutions, the
University will not have to resort
to salary cuts, but will still provide
for modest increases in faculty
salaries.

Other business included the adop-
tion of two memorial resolutions,
one for the late Henry N. Peters,
former professor of physical educa-
tion, and one for the late Clyde EB.
Burgee, former professor emeritus
of economics. Both died this past
August.

Solidarity with the UAW

In the dawn of campus activism,
the student-worker coalition was a com-
mon goal. Unfortunately, times have
changed. Students have turned from
silent, sluggish ‘passivism to increasing
violence. Labor, whose history is laced
with righteous violence, is developing in-
to a self-sustaining bureaucracy. The
middle ground, and the common ground
between students and workers, has been
lost in the shuffle.

With this in mind, and with the
hopes of reasserting this common
ground while at the same time lessening:
the student-worker tensions which have
exacberated with the single purpose of
political gain by the present administra-
tion, we offer a statement of solidarity
with the striking United Auto Workers.
This comes both as a sign of our under-
standing of the difficulties they face,

serves youth, especially disadvantaged
youth, in that the economy would need
more personnel to fill the emptying
spaces in the labor market. The bulk of
today’s soaring unemployment is made
up of inner city, lower class youth.
Finally, it is obvious that the price
of books goes up just as fast as, if not
faster than, the price of bread; and it is
the same administration which is letting
inflation run so rampant, through its al-
most casual attitude toward our eco-
nomic troubes, that is making increas-
ing American commitments, both in
workers’ money and students’ lives, in
dubious causes throughout the world.
G.M: The Biggest of Them All
The public is becoming increasingly
aware of the manner in which GM oper-
ates: it harasses and intimidates con-
cerned citizens whose investigations into

A simple call to unity, however, will
not produce unification; what will is the
realization by both students and work-
ers that they have, and will continue to
have, many common areas of discontent.
Bucknell students especially, with their
experience with a faculty which seems

its shams are valid but embarrasing, it
promises Walter Reuther in 1967 to re-
imburse the workers for any possible
error in the original cost-of-living in-
crease ceiling and hastily (and purpose-
fully) overlooks their earlier commit-
ment when it is time to sit down at the
bargaining table, it makes miillions of

national community through their de-
mands for an end to killing, pollution,

Footnotes

Py PAUL J. J. PAYACK

Alfred North Whitehead claimed that philosophers of every age
are governed, to some extent, by faculty held assumptions which are
never expounded upon. It has further been asserted that these pre-
suppositions can be brought to focus by understanding certain words.
W. K. C. Guthrie has stated that, ‘Language and thoughts are in-
extriciably interwoven... . words have a history and associations,
which for those who use them contribute an important part of the
meaning, not least because their effect is unconsciously felt.”

With this in mind I would like to explain a few etymologies that
I have stumbled upon (which may point to these interrelations).
There is a curious dichotomy between the words “‘education’”’ and
“knowledge.” The former, according to the Latin e ducere, refers to
a process, a drawing out, or a leading out of. However, with the
latter, one cannot find an active process even if it is traced back to
the Sanskitr. Knowledge is simply known. No effort need be applied
One gets the impression that you don’t have to think to know.

Now let’s take the word ‘‘mass.”’ We find that it is derived form
the Latin meaning that which adheres (like dough). It can also be
traced to the Greek maza (matzoh?) this time meaning barley-cake.
With this in mind we should examine the word in its current usage.
It has come to signify the common people, or as Ortega uses it “the
majority.” Vulgar has travelled in the opposite evolutionary direc-
tion. It is derived from vulgus, Latin for the common people

Others have abrogated their original meanings and assumed the
identity of their opposites. One example of this phenomenom is
‘dogma.” In classical days it defined something which was thought
to be true, an opinion. Now it has come to mean an arrogantly as-
serted truth. Another example is “rigmarole.’’ In days of yore its
‘root referred to a document of law. Today it is a synonym for a
nonsensical, confused statement. There is much to extriciate there.

There are, of course, etymologies which lead to no profound in-
sights but only to clearer understanding. For example, the heavenly
spheres making one turn, uus versum, defined the universe of the
ancients. “Worry” is derived from the Anglo-Saxon, to strangle.
The word “Bible” (biblos) is Greek for papyrus bark. And calling
our galaxy the Milky Way is redundant, since ‘galaxy’ is a de-
rivation of an archaic term for milk.

The ground for these assertions is the Indo-European language.
Reconstructed in the 19th century, it was originally spoken by an
as yet unidentified people (of Eastern Europe?) some 5,000 years
ago. English, most of the European and a number of Indian lang-
uages are descended from it, hence the name. Similarities in gram-
mar as well as vocabulary can be culled from among its branches.
A word commonly used to demonstrate this point is “brother.” In
Old English it is spelled brother; in Middle German, broder; in Old
Celtic, brater; in Latin, frater; in Greek, phrater; and in Sanskrit,
bhratr.

Once your curiosity about etymologies has been whetted a good
dictionary is indispensible. Webster’s New Twenith Century, and
those in its class, excell in such matters as does the Oxford Diction-
ary of Etymological English, obviously. However, due to their ex-
orbitant costs, $39.50 and $16.50 respectively, they are out of the
question for most students.

In the next category comes the standard college fare. Funk and
Wagnall’s, Webster’s New World, and the Merriam-Webster product
are all equally useful. The American ‘‘You don’t buy your old man’s
ideas, so why buy his dictionary.” Heritage is something of a disap-
pointment (although it specializes in Indo-European roots).

In the pocket variety the New Merriam-Webster has a groovy,
turned-on 1970 supplement. It, along with the New American Webster
(he must have had a large family) Handy College Dictionary are
both rather poor. Webster’s New World and le petit American Heri-
tage are your best buys here.

Letters
to the
Editor

Editor’s note; the following letter
was received by a student who felt
that the subject was of interest to
many members of the university
community.

Dear Pat,

You may be wondering who could
possibly be writing you from a dis-
tant place like Vietnam. I’m only
a stranger to you but I hope I will
get this message across to many.
I just happened to be in the ad-
ministration office of my squadron
when a Staff Seargant, of all people,
told me he knew you and that you
had taken part in a college demon-
stration in protest of the war. I
thought you would be in the right
position to hear my plea. Yes, un-
fortunately I am in the military
service and worse than that I’m in
the Marine Corp.

I thought that this would be a
great opportunity to inform some-
one on the outside who may feel
sympathetic to our beliefs. I am
also hoping that you might spread
the nature of our problem to the
rest of the concerned people.

My friends of the Revolutionary
movement and I are under a GES-
TAPO-TYPE rule of the PIGS of
MAG-11. The war itself is enough
to pressure us but now we are fight-
ing two wars, unfortunately one of
them is against our so called
leaders. I am one of the many who
have been busted here for suspicion
of using merijuana and other drugs.
We are now suffering the conse-
quences of these actions. Many of
my close friends are at this very
moment being processed for Un-
desireable Discharge and court
martials. Sure they have the power
and right to punish us for what they
believe we’ve done but the true fact
is that 80% or more are being
handled for suspicion only and
there are no facts to prove other-
wise. There is nothing in our power
we can do to curb or even stop
these communist tactics which the
Marine Corp is using against us.

To add to the already jungle-
slum type of living conditions only
the Marine Corp provides, they are
making living worse by exempting
us from the use of hot water and
other neccessities needed to main-
tain health in this diseased place.
Just think about this: Here we are

Kazin also cited that recognition
would benefit TDC because he feels
that “there is a certain stigma at-
tached to a fraternity with no form-
al recognition. “This discourages
incomnig freshmen.”

TDC has been awaiting Univers-
ity recognition since April 1970
when they submitted their applica-
tion. The IFC vote was only the
first step. The proposal must now
go before a faculty committee and,
if approved, be sent to President
Watts for the final decision.

TDC had hoped to have full
recognition by September of this
year (the beginning of rush). Al-
though somewhat disappointed with
the slow process and “red tape”
involved, the fraternity looks for-
ward to a pledge class of about 15 -
20 freshmen.

(Continued from Page 2) Right now there is another news-

in a war zone and when two hand
grenades explode in the vicinity of
the Seargeant Major quarters and
instantly after a few minutes of in-
vestigation by CID they conclude
that we so termed ‘‘dopers’’ are re-

I know but it’s true, it does happen

moment the members of the Naval
Intelligence crew are beating their
ill minds out trying to find some
way in which the attempted murder
charge can be hurled at us. And I
truly believe, based on what has
already taken place, that we will
be framed for this so that they can
prove their point that drug users
lead to violence and that we are a
menace to our country’s defense.
All us peacenicks want is to be left

poin of commiting murder to a-

that John Sebastian is a real hu-

able to accept his music for what
it was worth at least, but Sebastian
was the climax and Miles, the fall-
ing action. I felt like I was at a
high school dance, in terms of
juvenility.

It boils down to this: Sebastian’s
“Cheapo-Cheapo Rythm Section”
was really pumping naturally, and
Miles’ had to be cranked up and
needed an overhaul.

One last thought. I’m always sus-
picious of “Special Guest Stars.”
They are performers who have just
enough of a following to be popular.
Greedy promoters know that such
performers aren’t top-billing ma-
terial, but can’t be left in the B
slot either. So they come up with
the grand cop-out of “Special Guest
Star.” As it was, Miles was “de-

Knights Thwart Big Blue;
for Rebound

Coach Looks

By DAN MILLER

The sleeping giant rallied Satur-
day and the Scarlet Knights of
Rutgers rumbled over the Herd
21-7.

After losing 5 games in a row the
Kinghts came up with three touch-
downs to win their second game of
the season.

The lone Bison score occurred in
the second quarter. The Knights
were caught roughing kicker Bill
Lane after a punt.

The Herd took advantage of the
break and marched from Rutger’s
46 into the end zone.

The scoring play featured Rich
Diez smashing in from the 2:yard
line.

The Herd had a 7-0 lead at this
point but it was short-lived because
on the very next series of downs
Rutgers fumbled their way into’ the
endzone.

After marching to the BU °25
Scarlet quarterback Mike Yancheff
tossed a pass to Larry Christoff -at
the BU 10. Christoff was hit hard
enough to fumble the ball into tthe
endzone where Rutgers’ Bob ‘Schut-
te fell on it for the TD.

The play worked so well perhaps
every team should include it .in
their playbook.

Coach Fred Prender said that
“this last minute score seemed .to
give Rutgers a lift” that .they
brought out onto the field for the
second half.

The second half was a disaster
as far as the Bisons were con-
cerned. Not only did the Knights
find the endzone for two scores,
but also the Bison defense sustained
injuries to George Clayton and
Gene Depew that seemed to pull
the pins out from under the Herd

Twice the Scarlet Knights re-
turned Bill Lane punts to BU ‘ter-
ritory and both times Rutgers man-
aged to score with a minimum ef-
fort

The BU offense, on the other
hand managed just three first
downs in the second half compar-
ed to nine in the first.

The total offense for the second

lf amounted to 57 yards. Another

sting fact that aided the
Knights’ win was their return yard-
age

Both second quarter scores came
after Rutgers had established good

ield position on runbacks of BU
punts

teenth career pass to break the

Coach Prender said ‘“‘that it is
easy to attribute a loss to an in-
jury” or ‘‘a certain attitude on the
part of the players, but we played
a better team Saturday and they
beat us.”

He also feels that his ‘‘kids
weren’t ever out of the game...
a touchdown and an onsides kick

. could have made a big differ-
ence late in the game.”

Prender was pleased to be able
to say his team didn’t quit.

This Saturday the Herd faces a
decimated Colgate squad on Me-
morial Stadium turf in an effort to
even up their 3-4 record. With three
games remaining Prender insists
that his team will ‘‘bounce back.”

Bison Pitchmen Battle to Draw;
Face Delaware in Crucial Match

By JEFF QUINZER

That big game Saturday against
Delaware looms even larger on the
horizon after the Bisons played to
a 0-0 tie against the Leopards at
Lafayette.

Once again, the Bisons were out-
standing as they recorded their 3rd
straight shutout. However, the of-
fense continued to stutter, as 2
goals in the last 3 games would in-
dicate.

Several questions remain un-
answered before Delaware and the
Lafayette game did little to pro-
vide solutions.

For instance, how did this tie
effect the Bisons’ chance for a HAC
crown?

Will the offense snap out of its
slump? How is the team prepared
mentally and physically for Dela-
ware?

In answer to the first. question,
Coach Craig ‘Reynolds replied,
“This only means that we must
beat Delaware rather than tie them
in order to take the title. In a way,
its better to clinch a title with a
win than with a tie anyway. The
boys know they must beat Dela-
ware.”

“That is net our last game how-
ever. We must still play Lehigh and
they are still m the running. If we
beat Delaware and still lose to
Lehigh, there could be a 3-way tie.
However, this Saturday is our first
big challenge; if we don’t win this,
its all over.”

Concerning the scoring drought,
the coach feels that “the offense

Sunk Again
Cornell Subdues Polomen

By MARK KNODERER

Cornell withstood a fourth quarter
surge by the Bison A team to win
the 1970 Buckn: nvitational Water
Polo Tournament.

The championship game climax-
ed a weekend of rited clashes in
which the teams primed for the

championships at West
Point next weekend

In the first half of the champion-
ship game, the Bisons and the Big
Red matched each other goal for
goal. The half time score was 3-3.

The near capacity crowd cap-
tured the enthusiasm of the teams,
and shook the rafters after every
goal

In the third period Cornell util-
ized excellent ball handling by Rick
Marek and Bill Balchunas to move
into a 7-5 lead.

Early in the fourth quarter they
increased their lead to 8-5.

But B.U. ace Paul Landes scored
two goals within seconds midway
through the period, pulling the Bi-
sons within one. In the last few
mainutes of the game the teams bat-
tled furiously for possession of the
ball.

The final gun sounded with the
Bisons doggedly heading for the
Corbell goal.

Overall the Big Red seemed to
have more technique and better
execution, but what the Herd lacked
in finesse they made up for in grit.

Whenever maneuvered out of po-
sition the B.U. player would come
up with a little bit of extra effort
and catch the Cornell man from
behind,

As a result the Big Red did not

score a single fast break goal.

Earlier both the Bisons and Cor-
nell had survived major threats
from a St. Francis club which came
to play. Cardinal coach Chuck
Scheme used a zone defense which
literally surrounded the goalie with
defensive players.

Neither Cornell nor the Herd
could penetrate this blanket de-
fense, and had to be content with
shooting from the outside most of
the time.

The Bisons managed to stay even
or aheatl for the entire game, and
eked out an 8-7 win. The clinching

Coach Gulden sees great things for

and strives to meet the tough com-
petition he will face in the meets

The Coach expressed great pride
in the entire squad, since it takes
a team effort to win.

He believes that the desire of the
whole team to work together in
practice and push each other con-
tinously has been the key to their
success.

The results show this team spirit.

may be losing confidence. They’re
not taking the right shot and are
pressing.

“What we needed was a big game
where we really exploded . . This
team is capable of that type of
performance but we haven't got-
ten the last few games.

“The opportunities have been
there; its just impossible to explain.
When we've hit the ball well, its
been right at the goalie.

“The boys may be concentrating
just a little too much in trying to
do well. As a result, they’re rush-
ing their shots and are overeager
in the penalty area.

“Sometimes we shoot to quickly
when we have the time to man-
euver for a better shot. When we
have a good shot, we dribble and
pass too much and wind up losing
it?

Fortunately. the Bisons have a
whole week before the Delaware
game. This will give the team
time to work on special points in
their attack and the added rest is
needed for several of the injured
players.

Commented Coach Reynolds,
‘We're definitely hurting physical-
ly compared to the beginning of the
year; we have 5 starters out.
Against ‘Lafayette, our captain
Glenn Mars, Tom Cronin, and Jim
Ludwig were all injured. They will
probably be ready for Saturday but
whether they'll be at
ficiency is another story.

“We won’t be 100%, that’s for
sure. But that should be no excuse,

the same problems. I must say that
the subs have been playing very
well. This is a young ball team
that needs more work, even it is
past the midpoint of the season.

“We have to work on some spe- ,

cific things this week.”

There are several strong points
which the Bisons carry into this
weekend’s game. One it their fine
defense, which has a string of 3
straight shutouts and owns a total
of 4 this year.

Despite being whitewashed on
Saturday, they still outshot the
Leopards.

Coach Reynolds is “certainly not
unhappy with the way the defense
has played. What we need is more
midfield passing and more total of-
fense. We had better opportunities
than Lafayette to win the game
this week. They played their de-
fense close up and forced us to
pass long.

“Steve Gentino almost made the
shot that could have won the game.
From 20-30 yards out, he kicked
one of the hardest shots I’ve seen

all year. The ball just hit the cross- 7

bar and bounded away.”

In the B team game, the Bisons
battled the Leopards to a 1-1 tie as
Jim Hindle scored the lone Blue
goal.

VOLUME LXXIII— NO. 17

“ABS Reviews, Passes

By JENNY CHEN

In the beginning struggle with the
University Senate proposal, the ABS
passed four amendments and re-
jected one Wednesday night in an
attempt to create an ‘effective
document.’’

Dave Lacy, President, pointed
out that the ABS will treat the Sen-
ate document as a whole, enabling
the students to amend the proposal
at any place in the document.

In order to make the document
more consistent, an amendment was

“passed almost immediately concern-
ing the Conference Committee
under the ratification and amend-
ment procedure.

It now reads under Stage 3, ‘‘No
members of the Governance Com-
mittees (changed from committee)
that have functioned since Septem-
ber 1, 1968 (added to the amend-
ment) me be on the Conference
Committee.”

Another amendment passed con-
cerning part of the wording in the
purpose of the Senate to read ‘to
create a single body broadly repre-
sentative of the major groups of the
community, which shall investigate,
consider and develop (changed from
recommend) policies subject to the
approval of the President and Board
of Truste

Bob Na chin, ABS Treasurer,
said, ‘‘This is where the essence of

whether we want a stronger Senate
lies. Using the word ‘develop’ seems

to serve the University much better

©

Another matter of interpretation
of the Senate role resulted in the
passage of a tenth function of the
Senate, ‘‘to develop policies for the
administration and coordination of
information centers, e.g. the Book-
store, Library, and Computer Cen-
fer?

Although there may be an argu-
ment that this function is not con-
sistent with academic type func-
tions, Naschin explained that the
Senate functions should include all
the sonstituente of the University.

Along with this last amendment,
Lacy placed first on next week’s a
discussion of an amendment to add
a Committee on Information Re-
sources in keeping with the tenth
function.

ABS Debates PE Requirement

The debate concerning the
abolishment of the pdysical ed-
ucation requirement continued
Wednesday, as the ABS tabled a
new motion asking the physical ed-
ucation department to improve their
cirriculum, and offering credit for
gym courses taken

The motion passed last week
recommended that ‘“‘the physical
education requirement be changed,

New Psychology Field Cage

The outdoor field cage, in which the psychology department’s collection
of Japanese Snow Monkeys will live permanently, nears completion near
the Psychology Laboratory as workmen finish the screening. The inside
emulates the natural conditions for the snow monkey, including trees
cemented into the ground. Appropriate vegitation and a pond will be added.
The animal’s behavior and their physiological responses will be measured
from an observation tower, utilizing one-way glass, to be built on the roof
of the present Psychology Laboratory. Although several federal research
institutes have field cages in which animals live in their naturalistic sett-
ing, Bucknell’s field cage is believed to be the only one erected by a college

or university.

Funds for the project came from a Science Improvement

award given to Bucknell by the National Science Foundation.

In answer to the ABS recom-
nendation, Dean Leon Pacala of
the College of Arts and Sciences
wrote Dave Lacy, President of ABS,
earlier this week. He stated that
“the individual colleges do not have
jurisdiction over physical education
as a graduation requirement.”

However, he wrote that matters
pertinent to physical education as
a requirement should be directed to
the University faculty, through the
office of the Provost

In the second half of the ABS
meeting, Jim Ludwig, proposed an-
other recommendation to be sent
to the physical education depart-

Huey Newton Featured This Week
WVBU Begins Pacifica Series

By LINADA ANNE CAPUTO

WVBU has extended its FM pro-
gram to broadcast educational
tapes on controversial issues be-
ginning Sunday, from 2:30-5:00 p.m.

As an affilliate station of the
Pacifica network, WVBU will re-
ceive a series of tapes on selected
topics from the Pacifica Foundation
headquarters at the KPFA studios
in Berkeley, California.

This unique Pacifica program is
composed of two types of tapes: in-
terviews with such well known
people as Huey Newton, Reverend
Daniel Berrigan, Leroy Jones, Mar-

garet Mead, John Galbraith, Mada-
lyn O’Hair, Nicholas Johnson, and
the Soledad brothers as well as doc-
umentaries on the Black Panther
Party, Middle America, Politics of
Hunger, Latin America Policy, the
Black Artist, and Psychological
Analysis of Distructive Obedience.

This Sunday’s opening program
will consist of “‘An interview with
Huey Newton,” a statement con-
cerning Newton's opinion on his
recent trial, on Black Panther po-
sitions on other trials, on Eldridge
Cleaver, on plans for a Constitution-
al Convention in Washington, and

on Black Panther goals.

The second half of the program
will be a documentary entitled
“Revolution for Breakfast’? which
describes this Black Panther pro-
gram and the reaction of the child-
ren benefited by it.

Tom Ficklin will act as the co-
ordinator of this initial program by
providing an introductory back-
ground to the tapes, by clarifying
certain points which might be am-
biguous after one hearing, and by
offering personal comments on the
issues discussed.

Election Night ChaChaCha

By DAVID WEINBERGER

So we got a bunch of people in our living room watching the tv, NBC
(Frank McGee in wrap-around wire rims; we may have lost the govern-
ment, but we are taking over fashion), with the sound off and the stereo
decadently on, so that we could study. At midnight when NBC had a station
break with a half-time band spelling out in human letters ‘Yes or No?
Answers Come And Go. So?”, we took our own station break and had
chocolate brownie waffles. Linda forgot to halve the recipe so we had
more than enough.

The black numbers rolled around on the screen, like modern clocks
er birth and death rates put up by insurance companies. They were label-
Jed Democrat or Republican so that we could know who to root for with-
eut ever having heard of the candidates.

Even the candidates got into the game. In Pennsylvania, A. Goodman
beat A. S. Russian. Ruane beat Stank in the 10th district. Of course.
Congressman Russian? Congressman Stank?

Sander Vanocer told us about Hruska who is called “The Sage of
Nebraska” running neck and neck with a Democrat the Republicans call
“¥anoi Morrison.” The two fastest gun-slingers in the West. No wonder
they are running so close: with names as good as those, how could any-
one possibly choose between them?

“Did they project the N.Y. Senate thing yet?,” Linda asked from a
batter-splattered kitchen, “Yeah, it’s in its fourth orbit.”

Reagan got on television for a while. He was a star in “Knute Rock-
ne,” a very good film. We thought NBC had switched to it, deciding to
show the same old movie instead of the same old election. We were wrong.
While applause filled a pause in his speech thanking California for assent-
ing to voluntary occupation of their state, a voice reached over the clapp-
ing and asked ‘What is Reality?” Reagan pointed to the space between a
movie projector and a screen.

The trouble with Reagan began about 6 months after he was first
elected when the comedians ran out of Reagan jokes. We began to take
him seriously. Even if there isn’t anything new and funny to say about
him, Reagan is consistent enough to still be an actor.

Somewhere a candidate got a majority of the vote, but NBC, on the
basis of 2% of the vote in, predicted his defeat. Four years later, he was
still crying on the steps of the NBC office building, pleading for recogni-
tion. After five years, NBC still refused to grant him the election, but in
a gesture of compromise, did star him as the lovable idiot father in a
situation comedy series based on the life of Galileo.

David Brinkley, talking with Capt. James T. Kirk’s stutter, asked
John Chancellor what was on his desk. ‘‘That’s a video data computer,
the greatest thing since the electric bread slicer.” ‘‘Well,” said Brinkley,
“I’m sitting here at my desk with a pencil.”

A commercial came on showing cattle marching through San Francisco
protesting children’s not drinking enough milk. It was preceded by a sign
that said, “the following is a dramatization” to make sure that we didn’t
think we were watching the news. Then Scott Carpenter, the Astronaut
Cowboy, said that a certain gasoline made clean pollution, remembering
his own rocket which in bursting through our atmosphere ripped away
irreplacable molecules of air.

Fred began wondering what the election of 1976 will be like, on the
200th anniversary of the first American revolution. Nixon, having served
two terms, will yell “New Man!” like kids who a second ago had been
told ‘“‘You’re Dead!’’, while playing Army. He'll be on the tv, running
through the streets shouting, ‘The Brighteners are Coming! I regret that
I have but one enzyme to give for my laundry.”

By 10 p.m. the computers were through voting, and the question was
no longer candidate-against-candidate, who will win, but rather: the
population-< t-computer, who will be closer in predicting the out-
come. You don’t need a weatherman to see which way the wind blows:
you need a third generation computer.

The fudge brownie waffles began to get us upset. Fred missed Go-
odell’s concession speech while he'was in the bathroom. We didn’t tell him
bout it. What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him. And he’ll never be able to
tell the difference.

In 1976, the same guys will be running. The same repertory bringing
us a brand new rtizing campaign for the same old script. We'll elect
names and the repertory company will fill out the parts of the ‘duly
elected offici ’ while somewhere off in Nebraska the real president will
spit into his hand, slap it with his right, and see his spit pointing to
Yes or No, So?

Dawn came, turning up the brightness knobs on our windows, and we
began to drop off to sleep, still giggling. We usually watch late night
movies anaway, so tonight was nothing unusual. Even pleasurable, be-
cause our definite favorites are really crummy science fiction films.

Letters to the Editor

Mandatory Gym
To the Editor:

I would like to adress myself to
an editorial that appeared in Oc-
tober 23rd’s Bucknellian — an edi-
torial urging the freshmen and
sophomores to boycott physical
education in the hope that the re-
quirement itself would ‘“‘miraculous-
ly disappear.” I am not going to
comment here on the futility of
such tactics, nor am I going to
argue for or against “obtaining a
truly free and open university.”

What I do feel is at issue here is
the relative merits of our present
physical education program, Some-
thing has to be changed here, some-
thing that establishing an unlimited
cut polity or dropping the program
altogether will not solve. Such a
set-up as an optional gym program
would hurt the very students that
the present program is trying to
help.

More important than the neces-
sary healthy physical exercise that
physical education offers is the
desirability of exposure to differ-
ent athletic skills that justifies the
maintenance of a required physical
education program. Arguing that no
gym program at all would save
significant money is a blatant fal-
lacy. There would be no corres-
ponding decrease in the athletic
staff with the abolishment of phys
ed; for the staff is primarily hired
for teaching its specialty sport, not
the conducting of gym classes.

These briefly are some of my
arguments for maintaining some
form of required physical educa-
tion. What I feel the Bucknell Com-
munity should address themselves
to is possible alterations that would
make the present program more
viable. I take up this task in offer-
ing the following proposals and con-
structive criticisms

More options and offerings with-
in the present program are neces-
sary — the written tests at the end
of the semester are not. Fewer
and larger gym classes at more
popular hours of the day — classes
that would then of necessity have
to make many more activities
available to the student at the same
time. Each separate activity could
be administered by a different
member of the athletic department,
preferably his specialty. With ac-
tivities such as swimming, hand-
ball, basketball, golf, wrestling,
bowling, tennis, soccer, and weight
lifting offered at one time I do not
forsee a future over-crowded sit-

uation that will be any worse than
what exists now.

Students should be made more
aware of their present option to
complete four semesters of phys
ed. within eight semesters, Grant
the student more selectivity in de-
termining his own physical educa-
tion syllabus. Institute advanced
and beginner sections where feas-
ible in order to accomodate fresh-
man-throughout senior talent that
would also allow the ambitious or
the struggling student to work at

his own level of competence.

In short, there is much that can
be done to enhance the present
gym program, but boycotting gym
classes is not an effective means
to this end, nor is a boycott a
desirable end in itself.

Sincerely,
Dietrich Gruen

No Law and Order at Bloomsburg

I am one of the two members of the Bloomsburg State College Eco-
nomics Department recently suspended from teaching duties by Dr. Robert

Nassen, President of the College.

Dr. Nossens’ suspensions are illegal since according to our contracts

with the College, a faculty member is to be suspended on only three
grounds, none of which hold in our cases.

The three grounds are: 1. Treason, 2. Gross Immorality, 3. Certifica-
tion by ‘competent medical authority as to physical or mental disability.

Even if Dr. Joseph Skehan (the other department member) and I were
doing something wrong (which we aren’t) there are many other punish-
ments besides suspension available to President Nossen. Suspension is the
most severe punishment available to him and it is a very bad fit for the
crime we are supposed to have committed. -

The press release of October 7, 1970, announcing my suspension, con-
tained many untrue statements. The local press and radio refused to
publish my accusations as to the untruths contained in the release.

On advice of legal counsel I have continued to teach my classes. Dur-
ing the first five weeks of the school year, 20 out of 47 of my classes were
disrupted by administrators, for up to twenty minutes out of fifty. The
administrators were attempting to prevent my teaching or attempting
to prevent my students from attending class. These acts of disruption be-
gan three weeks before I received notification of my suspension.

Dr. John Hoch, Vice-President of the College has filed a criminal com-
plaint against me for disturbing classes which were, in fact, disturbed and
disrupted by him and other administrators.

The College in replacing Dr. Skehan and me with foreign nationals
who do not have the teaching qualifications called for in Section 2872 of
the School Laws of Pennsylvania.

I believe the real reason for my suspension is that, after four peaceful
years at Bloomsburg, I had the misfortune to discover that administrators
were involved in a gambling operation which was taking place in the
largest dormitory on campus, an operation which spread to the rest of
the campus and involved powerful faculty members. The Dean of Men,
the Asst. Dean, and secretaries initiated the operation in the dormitory
and profited from it.

I appealed to the Dean of Students, their superior, to stop the opera-
tion and bring about restitution of lost monies to students. He failed to
stop it, and my exposure of his failure, probably embarrased him. (When
I threatened to inform the Board of Trustees as to what was going on, I
was warned that to do so would cause me to lose my tenure.) Mr. Hun-
singer the Dean of Students (now Assoc. Vice President) has powerful
political connections in Harrisburg, Northumberland County, and now,
sadly, in Columbia County.

The Secretary of Education, theBureau of State Colleges, and they
Board of Trustees have over the last six months been kept informed of
the violations of State Law and College Law committed by President
Nossen and various of his administrators. They have taken no action
visible to me.

We know that Law and order do not exist at Bloomsburg State College
There is an interesting question of whether they exist in Harrisburg.

FEEDBACK: Review

To the Editor:

Although I personally agreed with
Dean Landew’s review of the Se-
bastian/Miles concert, his last para-
graph has no place in the article.
He seems to imply that the inclu-
sion of Buddy Miles on the bill as a
“Special Guest Star,” and his last-
minute placement to the second act
of the evening, was an attempt by
an un-named ‘‘greedy promoter’’
(to use his ill-chosen words) to foist
something on the Bucknell com-
munity.

The reviewer should be informed
of two things: 1) the matter of bill-
ing was necessitated by a legality.
2) Judging by the incredible length
of Buddy Mile’s performance due to
the audience’s ecstatic reaction (not
to mention his very substantial cre-
dentials as a musician: Hendrix and
the Electric Flag), a very large
segment of Bucknell did not feel
that anything was foisted on them.

If Miles had been universally un-
popular, and if the Concert Com-
mittee had thought that he would
be, and if they had some motive for
bringing him here anyway, then
perhaps we should be critical of the
Committee. In fact, none of these
conditions were actualized. So the
reviewer was apparently attacking
the Committee for having the gall
to disagree with his personal taste.

And there is one thing that the
reviewer should be aware of: the
Concert Committee donates an in-
credible amount of time and energy
to Bucknell to bring us the finest
concert series any relatively small
campus in the country ever had.
That’s no exaggeration. Perhaps we

should be more grateful for their
volunteered efforts and their huge
success, and also a little more

tolerant of other people’s tastes.
Sincerely,
David Weinberger

Livingston Taylor: A Review

By JOHN FRIEDMAN

Livingston Taylor’s album is good. The problem in listening to
his album is the similarities to brother James. You expect Living-
ston to do a Fire and Rain riff after every song. Liv. can’t play
guitar like James. He uses basic chord progressions and does little
picking. His voice is not as rich as Jame’s (it could be the equip-
ment), but it is just as pleasant. Where James uses references to
his days in the “zoo,” Liv, refers to his days on the road and his
appreciation of his friends. He writes all his own songs and this is
what really struck me. The songs with no exceptions are great. (The
sign of a good album; the more you play it the more you like it.
This thought fits perfectly.)

The first song “Sit on Back” is a fast rendition of some of
Jame’s thoughts. The melody is very catching and Liv. tells us to
live our own life. The next four songs add very intelligently switch
fast to slow. “Doctor Man” is a ballad, “Six Days on the Road”’ is
rock and roll. “Packet of Good Times” has a James thought that
tells us to keep the good times. “Hush A Bye” is a lullabye sung to
his girl-woman. The second side is even more fun. ‘Carolina Day”
sounds like “Carolina on my Mind’’- James. He's back with his two
brothers James and ugh, and sister Kate. It seems that in times of
thought James and Liv. go to the same place. “Can’t Get Back
Home” tells of his home, his relation to his parents and brothers.
He can’t get back. “My home is dust, it’s so undefined.” ‘‘In my
Reply’’ is another story-ballad. He replies to a dying man who asks
if he will ever see Ohio again, his reply to this and other questions
is - ‘I don’t know.”

As I’m getting tired of reviewing every song, I would just like
to say that you must understand Livingston. He is an excellent
musician and if James hadn’t gotten there first he would be con-
sidered Livingston’s brother. He thinks a lot like James and his
songs show it. He has tremendous talent which will be appreciated.
Speaking of Good Times and Sunshine, speaking of Livingston and
James.

Handicapped
To the Editor:

As a parent and teacher of the
handicapped I am curious to learn
what you are doing at Bucknell:
students, administrator, and teach-
ers, for the handicapped in your
midst? A few questions come to
mind:

(1) are his needs taken care of so
that he will have a minimal amount
of discomfort trying to earn his de-
gree? If he is blind, has anyone
seen to it that he has a seeing eye
dog if he wants one? If he doesn’t,
has anyone worked out a buddy
system so that he’ll have someone
to help him through each month?
If this is divided up everyone will
gain from the experience.

(2) if he is a blind vet, let’s say,
is he on the ground floor where he
should be or has he been given an
eyrie on the top floor? If so maybe
someone would volunteer to swap
rooms, someone on the first floor,
ie. We're all generous by nature;
it’s just that we don’t think.

(3) about note-taking: the Alex-
ander Graham Bell Association for
the Deaf (1537 N.W. Wash., D.C.)
has for sale some type of note book
which takes notes in triplicate so
that they may be passed on to that
deaf student who is in your class.
This could also be used for the blind
or anyone else in need of notes.

(4) in planning that beautiful mil-
lion dollar student center are you
thinking of those who might need
a ramp in order to enter and leave
that building? At Expo et al. the
needs of the handicapped were kept

Address letters to Dr. Arnold Werner, Box 974, East Lansing, Michigan
48823.

QUESTION: All my life I have had the unique capability to pass a far
greater volume of gas than the average member of my species. An ex-
planation of my gaseous state escapes me because I consume a normal
daily diet and can turn on with anything from cereal to sauerkraut. {
recently considered a medicale examination thinking my problem (and
often that of others in the immediate vicinity) might be due to a metabolic
disorder or an over-abundance of micro-organisms in my digestive tract.
Also, what are the physiological consequences of observing proper eti-
quitte when the pressure builds and “‘not firing at will.”

ANSWER: Gaseousness is a rather common condition. It may be mani-
fested by flatulence (passing of large amounts of gas or flatus through
the rectum) as you describe or excessive belching. Some readers’ pristine
self- image may be shattered but, most people pass about two to three
quarts of gas daily. Mercifully, almost all of its odorless and passed
silently.

There are three basic sources of gas in our intestinal tract. Air enters
when we swallow foods and liquids, carbon dioxide is released during
digestive processes and bacteria produces methane, hydrogen and hydro-
gen sulfide through fermentation processes. The latter three are ii
flammable. There are metabolic disorders and infections of the gastro-
intestinal tract which can produce gaseousness, but by far the most com-
mon cause is aerophagia, or air swallowing. A common sign of anxiety,
this condition becomes a compulsive habit in some people. Air intake can
accompany increased swallowing of saliva, gum chewing, sucking on hard
candy, etc. People with this condition can also admit large volumes of
air to the stomach during respiration.

Aside from an explanation of the process and reassurance, the source
I consulted recommended exhailing prior to swallowing any food or liquid
As well, you should eliminate whipped foods and carbonated beverages
from your diet. He also suggests holding something between your teeth,
like a pencil, which would make it difficult to swallow! Of course, if you
are especially anxious you might consider seeking help for that.

I could find no reported cases of explosions resulting from not “firing
at will” but cramps could result after a while.

correct. The motion which did pass
was one to recommend to the Fac-

of money spent on intercollegiate
athletics, and to develop a justifica-
tion for this amount.

Kodak Educational Aid Fund
Awards $8750 to University

The University has been awarded
two grants totaling $8,750 from the
Eastman Kodak Company as part
of the company’s $3.3 million educa-
tional aid program for 1970.

The University has received a
grant of $3,750 as one of 101 private-
ly supported colleges and universi-
ties awarded unrestricted grants
totaling $631,500.

These grants are based on the
graduates from these institutions
who joined Kodak within five years
after graduation and are presently
completing five years of company
employment.

Kodak contributes $750 for each
year of academic work completed
by the employee at a privately sup-
ported, accredited school from
which he or she received a bache-
lor’s or graduate degree.

The University is also one of 16
schools emphasizing the liberal arts
or having educational programs of
particular interest to Kodak which
have received special grants of
$5,000 each.

Dr. L. K. Eilers, Kodak chair-
man, and Gerald B. Zornow, Kodak

president, in a joint statement an-
nouncing the grants said “Financial
pressure on our colleges and uni-
versities is one of the quiet crises
facing our country. We are at a
period, not only in our national
history, but in the history of civili-
zation as we know it, where man-
kind’s survival depends on the rapid

coming a geometrically expanding

“Not only is knowledge expand-

steadily increasing, creating that
need for more and more facilities
and larger faculties. It is no wonder
that more colleges and universities
are seeking help.”

Ludwig argued that “‘it would not
be too much to ask to give one
credit to those who want to take 4
semesters of gym.”

The three parts to his amendment
state that the physical education
department offer specific area
courses and that they be outlined
in the University catalogue, that
the .25 credit towards graduation
per semester be counted into the
student’s G.P.A., and that a wide
range of elective courses be offered
that are sufficient in depth to war-
rant credit.

However, part of the amendment
was amended to read, “For each
semester of participation in one of
these courses, a student shall re-
ceive one quarter credit towards
graduation and that the maximum
of courses that can be taken for
credit will be four.”

A further amendment “‘to stay
within the bounds of their present
budget” was tabled for further dis-
cussion along with the Ludwig mo-
tion until the first recommendation
is deliberated upon.

Departments Understaffed
Large Enrollment Creates

Serious Faculty Shortage

By JACKIE STUBBA

Features Editor’s Note: The fol-
lowing is the first in a three-pari
series: The results of interviews
with department chairmen, dealing
with student/faculty rations in each
department, will comprise the col-
lection.

One of the major advantages that
this university enjoys over other
colleges is its comparitively small
total student enrollment - approxi-
mately 3000 students.

Maintaining this figure creates
the opportunity for personal contact
with faculty members and for in-
dividual attention. The problems
arising relative to material covered
can be dealt with personally; there

Focus:

is not the feeling of “being lost
among the multitude.” Yet, su-
staining an adequate student-fac-
ulty ratio requires a sufficient num-
ber of faculty members.

Several department chairmen
were interviewed to determine if
this type of immediate relationship
exists. The chairmen of the depart-
ments responded to questions of
student enrollment vs. staff suffici-
ency.

Professor F. D. Martin, chairman
of the department of philosophy,
counted the total number of en-
rolled philosophy students as 318,
including the 160 students in intro-
ductory courses.

Calculating the  student-faculty

The Draft

y DAN MARTIN

Features Editor’s Note: The following article is the first in a
series digested from the “BUCKNELL ENGINEER,” March 1970,
Vol. 21, Number 3, based on an article by Joseph W. Rogers, as-
sistant professor of electrical engineering, entitled “A Short Look
At Selective Service.” The series is meant to illuminate its readers
concerning the Military Selective Service Act, in particular, and

the draft, in general.

For American males over the age of eighteen, the draft is pro-
bably an issue of major concern. Although this seemingly much-
protested institution wields suich tremendous power, it is interesting
that many people (college undergraduates included) know little
about the workings of the Selective Service System Furthermore,
they usually do not take sufficient time to analyze their relationship
with the Selective Service until it is too late.

Since Regulation 1641.1 states, “Every person shall be deemed
to have notice of the requirements of the Military Selective Service

Act of 1967. .

” the intention of this article is to present a brief

introduction to the obligations which eighteen year old males have,

under the law.

Initial Registration
The law currently in affect, governing military eligibility, is the

Military Selective Service Act of 1967,

to include the lottery

recently amended in order

Males passing their eighteenth birthday re-

gister with the Selective Service System and fill out SSS Form 100,
the Classification Questionaire. (Younger men can look forward to

this procedure.) Selective
provimately 4,100 local boa

vice then
Is, using answers on the questionaire

assigns men to one of ap-

to determine their draft status — a status selected from one of eigh

teen classifications

For those who have not yet registered, a hint might be heeded.
Completion of the SSS Form 100 is not required at the initial re-
gistration. One should explain to the clerk. If asked to complete
this form, that ten days are allowed to complete it under the pro-
visions of Regulations 1621. 10. Ordinarily this form is mailed after

the initial registration.

Once in possession of the questionaire, it should be filled out
very carefully, since the answers provided may determine how soon
one is to be drafted, or if one is to be drafted at all. The regula-
tions instruct that the lowest classification, for which one is eligible
should certainly be awarded, with I-A being the highest classifica-
tion. A partial list of classifications follows:

Class Description

I-A Available for military service
I-A-O Conscientious Objector available for noncombatant mili-

tary service only

LO Conscientious Objector available for civilian work contribu-
ting to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or in-

terest.

I-S Student deferred by status

LY Registrant not eligible for a lower class who would be
qualified for military service in time of war or national

emergency

I-A Registrant deferred because of civilian occupation

II-S Registrant deferred because of activity in study

LD Member of reserve component or student taking military

I-A Registrant with child or children; and registrant de-

ferred by reason of extreme hardship to dependents

IV-F Registrant not qualified for any military service

Student Deferments

The Military Selective Service Act of 1967 does provide for
student deferments. The law states that the President shall ‘‘pro-
vide for the deferment from training and service in the Armed
Forces of persons satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of in-
struction at a college, university, or similay institution of learning
and who request such deferment.’ Such a deferment continues until
the completion of the requirements for a baccalaureate degree, or
until the student fails to pursue, satisfactorily, a full-time course of
instruction or attains his twenty-fourth birthday.

Several conditions of this law should be considered, together
with the relevant regulations. Regulation 1622.25, (which defines
the satisfactory pursuit of a full-time course of instruction), states
that this condition is satisfied if a student, during his academic
year, has earned credits toward his degree which, when added to
prior credits earned, represent a proportion of the total number
required to earn his degree — according to norms established by

the school.

To most college faculties, this definition would be unsatisfactory,
since grade point averages and other requirements should consti-
tute part of the definition also. Certainly, before asking that the SSS
form 109 (Student Certificate) be sent to the draft board, one should
consider the school’s definition probably given in its Announcement

or Catalog.

Although the paragraph discussing II-S deferments

impiles that one can hold such a status only once, and continously,
until it expires, the regulations do not make any such stipulation
For example, a registrant after receiving a ILS deferment, who
must drop out of school for a considerable length of time because
of illness, is indeed permitted to re-apply for such a status upon his

return to school.

ratio to be 21:1, he commented that
the department is understaffed and
the members are overworked. Al-
though it varies with each professor,
he estimated an average of 30 hours
per week spent by staff members
in the classroom and in outside pre-
paration. “‘They are also expected
to publish, in order to keep them
abreast in their fields. Publication
and good teaching go hand in hand.

Each year the department re-
quests enlargement of its staff; how-
ever, because of the University’s
limited budget, the request must be
denied.

Martin continued, ‘‘If a new mem-
ber were added, it would have to be
detracted from the salary of those
here now.”

Over the past few years the stu-
dent-faculty ratio in this depart-
ment has increased in response to
the increase in philosophy majors,
putting a much larger strain on the
staff for individual consultations.
Although Professor Martain would
like to see one more member on the
staff, he added that it does not ap-
pear feasible at the present time.

Professor William H. Cooper,
chairman of the economics depart-
ment, cited the total student enrol-
led ineconomics as 732, including
360 in the introductory courses
Finding the student-faculty ratio to
be 40:1, he affirmed that the de-
partment is understaffed, saying
that a ratio of 20:1 would be a more
reasonable figure. ‘“‘The faculty is
tremendously overworked,’ he
stated, and needs four new mem-
bers to produce a 20:1 ratio, but
would gladly reveive even more

Requests to enlare the econom-
ies staff can not be met, due to the
budget. ‘“‘The University is sympa-
thetic but there’s no action,” re-
plied the professor. Usually the de-
partment chairman teaches two
classes; however, this year, Cooper
has had to take on three to meet the
demands of the rise in student en-
rollment.

He sees the educational advanta-
ges declining, since larger classes
eliminates a large amount of stu-
dent participation and interchange
of ideas. “Larger classes tend to in-
hibit the students from speaking
out,’ he explained. “They feel they
are imposing on others by taking up
class time with their comments.”

Professor Cooper agrees that
there seems to be little chance of
attaining needed members with the
budget in its present situation

murderer who killed at least 5 pro-
stitutes in the autumn of 1888, is
thought to have been Edward, Duke

ROTC Survey Reveals
Pro & Con Sentiments

By KARL BLAKE

Why does a student take ROTC

m this campus?

Evidently, on the basis of the
following conversations, students
are attracted to ROTC for a num-
ber of reasons other than the basic
one of preferring to enter the army
as an officer rather than a Private
While not an entirely comprehen-
sive survey, the following does re-
present many of the reasons stu-
dents “‘enlist’” or drop ROTC here.

U.S. military history is studied in
the first two years, and many of the
49 freshmen, 20 sophomores, 12
juniors and 35 seniors find the
ROTC program engaging because
of such inquiry

Walter Lutz, '72, admitted that
ROTC was “‘one of the most worth-
while things I’ve taken here,” and
added that, ‘In today’s tension-fil-
led world, if you don’t understand
the balance of power, you can’t
understand anything else. ROTC
helps you achieve this understand-
ing.

Mark James, '73, agreed: “I’m
really learning something in ROTC
— as opposed to what I’m doing in
some other courses.”

Gary Weaver, ’74, observed that
ROTC ‘does provide a different
perspective on history: You learn
the military reasons for wars
whereas in most courses you study
the political reasons.’

Rick Brown, ’74 added that ROTC
“Jets you see all sides of the issues,
while most of what is, say, being
printed now is written from a one-
sided viewpoint.”

Another freshman also, apparent-
ly, feels that the academic content
of ROTC courses has some merit
He plans to “take the first two
years to learn as much as possible
about the army and then drop out.”

The seemingly old practice of
joining the army in search of ‘‘ad-
venture” has largely disappeared in
our times, but not altogether. One
student observed: “I'll probably
have to sit in some office for most
of the rest of my life, so first I'd
like to travel around. I don’t think
I’d like to travel to Vietnam, but if
it cames up, I guess I'll go.”

Some people trying to
some perspective on their life wind
up in Haight-Ashbury; others wind
up in the army. Rick Diez, ’73, said
“One of the reasons I joined is that
I'm not really sure what I want to

do. I thought that, as an officer in |

the army, I could have a look at
some different careers and gain a
little time.”

Students leave ROTC for a variety
of reasons, too.

Jim Nock, ’73, once felt so strong-
ly about his “obligation” to serve
that he enlisted in ROTC in spite
of the fact that he could have ob-
tained a physical deferment and
avoided military service altogether

Last spring, however, he left the
program. ‘“‘What made me drop out
was the Cambodia invasion. It

seemed to me that if the army was |
going to be handled that badly it |

wouldn’t really do me any good, or

the country any good, to support it |

at that time.”

enlisted in |
ROTC originally in order to get |
the two-year deferment which would

enable him to go to graduate
school after graduation. And, after
drawing number 344 in the draft
lottery, he. exited from RIC, but
with no regrets regarding his ROTC
experience.

“My conception of what the army
was like had been terribly negative,
but in ROTC I gained an apprecia-
tion of it. Being an officer is a job
like any other and not such a de-
testable thing as I’d been led. to
believe.”

Dave Carpenter, ’72, first enlisted
in ROTC because he felt that the
leadership qualities he would gain
and the contacts he would make in
the army would be of benefit to
him in a business career.

After recently forming a small
business of his own (in automobile
racing), he decided he no longer
needed the military exxperience,
and left the program

A number who are in ROTC are
not happy about it. One student ad-
mitted: ‘I have a ROTC scholar-
ship. That’s the only reason I was
in it at the beginning and that’s the
only reason I’m in it now. I don’t
really like the program

Others solely remain in ROTC be-
cause of low draft numbers which
will eventually force them to enter
the military

THE BUCKNELLIAN
NOV. 6, 1970 PAGE FIVE

By DAVID HAMMER

This week’s interview was con-
ducted with Colonel Joseph J. On-
dishko, chairman of, and professor
in, this University’s Military Sci-
ence Department. Colonel Ondishko
openly discusses today’s college stu-
dent and his attitudes, his own im-
pressions of this year’s freshman
class, the defense budget, the role
of the United Nations and, among
other subjects, the circumstances
bringing him to this University
(with the approval of the University
Administration). And it is with this
topic that the interview opens.

BUCKNELLIAN: How did you, as
a Colonel in the army, happen to
come here?

ONDISHKO: I was assigned to
this University, after completing an
assignment at the Pentagon. They
have, in the army, certain stops
which they call ‘career develop-
ment,’ and one of the steps that
you can have as a Colonel is to go
to ROTC-type duty.

A situation had existed wherein
this University had not had a per-

manent PMS for some months prior
to the time that my opportunity
came up for reassignment — so I
accepted the position here and my
assignment was approved by the
University administration. I arrived
for duty on November 10, 1969, so
I've been here a little less than a
year.

B: What was your motivation for
choosing a PMS position as opposed
to another assignment in the
service?

0: I enjoy working with young
people — they’re dynamic indi-
viduals. I thought, frankly, that the
pace might be a little easier com-
pared with the hectic rat-race of
some of the other jobs I’ve had in
the past.

B: Have your expectations been
met?

O: Yes, it’s easier than what I
was doing before; the types of frus-
tration are different than they were
at the Pentagon.

B: Being in a college environment
now, do you feel that the college
student, in general, is preparing

himself for a role in the society he
will imminently enter; is he show-
ing himself, in your opinion, to be
aware of the role he will eventual-
ly take in the world?

0: He is very definitely aware.
The college student, today, has
more of an awareness of the ac-
tivities of the world in general than
does the college student of even ten
years ago.

People are delving more into the
background of things rather than
just the superficial stuff on the sur-
face: they’re asking ‘Why?’ where-
as, before, they just accepted things
as Gospel, so to speak — they’re no
longer doing that; they’re looking
for the reasons behind what is on
the surface. And that ‘looking’
broadens an over-all education, no
matter what subject it is that you’re
studying.

The young people today, in many
respects, are more aggressive than
they used to be: trying to find out,
not taking one answer as the
answer, having an awareness of
their surroundings, being more
eager to participate in different en-
deavors (not all of which are just
directed towards the immediate
goal at hand — namely, acquiring
their college degree).

B: Do you feel that college stu-
dents, generally, are frustrated in
their searching — and is there ex-
change from all sides?

O: I’m sure there’s more of an
opening from any and all sides.

B: Speaking for the ‘military

| side,’ do the armed services feel

pressured to ‘open up?’
©: They’re accepting the open-

| ness for what it is — an attempt

at better communication than they
have had in the past.
For instance, there’s been a lot of

| criticism levelled at ROTC and the

ROTC program — what it used to
be. Just in a general sense, many

| of the people in the army ROTC
| agreed that those criticisms level-

led at the program have not all
been destructive: much of what
they’re saying has made for a more
constructive program.

B: Concerning criticism of the

North Front Street
742-9392

ROTC program, have you seen a
change in the relationship between
the academic and military com-
munities in the recent past?

0: I feel that there is a much
closer relationship between what
used to be the military environ-
ment and the academic environ-
ment — at all levels.

For example, start off on a
national level: There’s a_ panel
which holds meetings and seminars,
headed by a Dr. Benson, which has
had much to do with offering a
liason between the academic com-
munity and the Department of De-
fense. At each level you reach as
you go down the military chain of
command, you find a closer tie be-
tween the academic and the mili-
tary positions, until you get to the
college level itself.

And, just since I’ve been here
(which, admittedly, is a very short
time), I’ve seen a more moderate
feeling towards ROTC than had
been here before — and I’m talking
about a feeling noticed throughout
the entire academic community.

B: In view of this moderation
(and the lottery), have you ‘noticed
a change in those people electing to
enter the ROTC program?

0: I can’t distinguish between
what has happened here in the past
and what is happening now, but I
can give you a capsullated feeling
of how I look at this year’s fresh-
man class.

The freshman class today has an
awful lot of enthusiasm: I feel very
strongly in favor of this year’s
freshman class, as I’ve seen it. I
have impressions of them buckling
down to work, wanting to do the
best they can, keeping an open
mind, reasonably inquiring.

B: Besides ROTC scholarships,
what do you feel motivates many of
the freshman to choose an ROTC
program in college?

0: Many men would like to see
what a military career would offer
them.

B: Do you think, as freshmen,
they can get an idea of such a
career right away?

O: No, not right away: I don’t

and condition.

“Here we go with the same
old platitudes,” you sigh.
Well, maybe you can’t distin-
guish between a platitude
and the truth. “Everything
works out for the best” ‘is a
platitude. “All things work
together for good to those
that love God, to those who
are called according to His
purpose,” is the truth. .

Of course everything isn’t
going to work out for your
good if you continue penned

think they have ‘instant understand-
ing’ of what a military career is
like when they walk in the door as
freshmen — but we do have a two-
year program, for those who may
decide to join ROTC in their junior
year, once they’re adjusted to col-
lege.

B: Moving away from ‘college’
questions, and regarding defense
spending instead, do you not feel
that devoting 34.6% of the Federal
budget for defense seems unneces-
sary?

©: There has been more and
more emphasis, in the papers, on
different critics of the present Ad-
ministration who say that we ‘don’t
need more dollars for defense, but
more defense for our dollars.’ Whe-
ther I think the money’s needed
for defense, I’m really not in a
position to say; how they arrive at
these budget figures, I’m not in a
position to say — I don’t know what
-all goes into the making of the de-
fense budget. I do know, though,
that the budget is scrutinized by
the House and Senate very care-
fully and that the military share of
the budget (percentage-wise) is
smaller now than it has been since
1950.

B: How can the taxpayer be pro-

tected from cost overruns which
have been prevalent recently, ad-
ding to the immense budget for de-
fense (and offense)?
0: I don’t know. Certainly, propor-
tionately, we ought to receive as
much for our dollar as we can,
whether we’re speaking of defense,
education or whatever.

B: You were recently awarded
membership to the Infantry Officer
Candidate School’s Hall of Fame.
How did you receive that honor?

0: You’re recommended for that,
and I was recommended by a con-
temporary of mine who knew of
my background and nominated me
to the Infantry OCS Hall of Fame.
From then on, it was a matter of
contact between Fort Benning,
Georgia Infantry School and myself.

B: What qualifications must one
have to be recommended?

O: Experience is one factor. Also,
you have to be a graduate of OCS
at the Infantry School, obtain the
rank of Colonel and have some dis-
tinguishing facet in your service.

B: As a member of the military,
with the 25th anniversary of the
United Nations just passed, do you
feel that its role as ‘peace-keeper’
has been fulfilled?

O: There is a place for a United
Nations organization — I would like
to see it accomplish more than it
has, though. People expect more
from the organization that the
organization has been able to pro-
duce.

The United Nations has been

| worthwhile, however, if not from a

peace-keeping standpoint, at least
from other standpoints, such as set-
ting up the World Health Organiza-

| tion. It’s a step in the right direc-

tion.

B: In a true democracy, majority
rule is of the utmost importance.
Do you feel that majority rule runs
this country?

O: I believe in the elective pro-
cess and our form of democratic
government.

Believing that way, the two house
system is a good system. I do like
the system of checks and balances
that we have, as well.

B: Do you think the checks and
balances system actually works?

O: Yes, I do.

B: Feeling as you do, do you
think the vote is the citizen’s most
important weapon?

0: Democratically, yes, but that
doesn’t mean that we can discount
other forms of influence like pres-
sure groups, interest groups, and
the like — they all contribute to
change.

Ryysylainen:

By DAVE COULTER

Six years ago this fall the soccer
team at Scotia High School in
Scotia, N.Y. found itself without a
goalie.

Their expected goalie was unable
to come out for the team as a result
of other responsibilities. Thus
several of the team members per-
suaded junior Lloyd Ryysylainen,
who had never played the game be-
fore, to try out for the vacated
goalie position.

Luckily he made the team and
began developing ‘from scratch”
along with the rest of the squad.

Believing that one “learns from
errors,” Lloyd admits to learning
a lot playing behind their often
penetrated defense. However this
experience was certainly not wast-
ed, as he has proven in his per-
formance for the Bisons.

As a result of his high school ex-
perience the BU goalie appreciates
a good defensive backfield and he
has only words of praise for this
season’s squad. Even though the
Bisons lost two all-MAC fullbacks,
he feels that this year’s defense,
led by such standouts as Larry
Greenwood, is stronger than last
year’s.

The goalie is the ‘‘quarterback of
the defense,’ Lloyd explaines. ‘‘He
must know the positions and direct
the play.’’ Furthermore, the goalie
is awarded the opportunity to make
the “final mistake.”’

Lloyd recognizes the great dif-
ferences between his required skill
in the use of his body, hands, and
feet, and his teammates, and sights
the affective utilization of these
special capabilities as the most dif-
ficult thing for a goalie to learn.

The particular “ability to be able
to judge whether or not to come out
of the cage to intercept a lob pass
or to grab a loose ball” is to him
the most important of the talents a
goalie must acuire.

The major weakness of the Bisons
is the lack of a “high powered scor-
ing attack.” Lloyd believes that
this is a combination of the team’s
“lack of experience and the absence
of the coordination necessary to
play together well as a team.”

As in any sport, the Blue goalie
professes, the ‘‘major thing in soc-
cer is teamwork.”

Lloyd feels the “hustle” of the
players and the “inspiring leader-
ship of the juniors and seniors”
have been essential to the Bison’s
success this season.

He also sees the great ‘‘opti-
mism” of the squad and the action
of “the team working together, with
everyone for each other’’ as two of
the other key factors in their win-
ning ways.

The guiding influence of Coach
Reynolds provides an extra advan-
tage for the Bisons in Lloyd’s opin-
ion.

The BU goalie comments, “The
Coach expects one hundred plus
percent from everyone in practice
and in the game. However it is
seldom that someone does not want
to work; Coach Reynolds just seems
to instill in us a pride to win, for
the Coach and the team.”

The unbeaten record of the Bisons
at home this year is to Lloyd an
indication of the support the fans
have given the team. He suggests
that it is “the fans, too, that make

Bison Goalie

a soccer team,” and adds a “big
thank you for the team for the
general spirit” of their supporters.

The Bison ‘‘defensive aparter-
back” has great hopes for the re-
mainder of the season, as he be-
Jieves their team “has not yet
played to its full potential.” He ex-
pects a demanding challenge in the
upcoming clash with league- lead-
ing Delaware which will either ‘“de-
stroy any hope, or be a giant step
toward the crown.”

He definitely is eager to see the
Bisons advance into the finals and
battle Westchester, their highly-
rated rival, for the MAC title.

Looking into the future Lloyd pre-
dicts winning records for the Blue
soccermen in the next three or four
seasons, if the young nucleus stays
together and continues to develop
as a team.

However, right now the most im-
portant event in the future of the
BU booters and goalie Lloyd Ry-
ysylainen is Saturday’s decisive
game with Delaware.

This effort will undoubtedly test

Raiders from Colgate and give
them a new deal. Colgate has a 4-4
record but has polished its offensive
and defensive units until now they
are in excellent shape.

Steve Goepel, a 6-2 strongboy is
at his second year as head of the
Raider’s offense. The senior quarter-
back has operated a smooth attack
behind an experienced line. He has
completed 94 of 195 passes for 1255
yards and eight touchdowns.

He is also an excellent punter and
field goal kicker.

Head Raider Coach, Neil Wheel-
wright, dropped his star running
back in the beginning of the season
for disciplinary reasons but the
team has displayed greater unity
and fullback Steve Morgan has
bulled his way for 290 yards in his
last two games to take up the slack.
Goebel’'s favorite receivers are
flanker Steve Fraser with 29 re-
ceptions for 502 yards and split end
Steve Saxton with 18 grabs for 290
yards

The water polo club travels to Cornell this weekend
to participate in the Eastern Water Polo Championships.
The eight top teams from the East and New England

clash for the crown.

Participating in the tournament will be the three top
Harvard, North-
eastern, and M.LT., and the four top teams from the
Eastern League, Yale, Army, Cornell,

teams from New England League,

and Bucknell.

On Saturday the Bisons play a round-robin tourna-

England champion, Northeastern, and Cornell.

On Sunday the top two teams from each division

clash for the championship.

The rest of the season can be forgotten, for this tour-

Last year the Bisons jelled at exactly the right time

and went on to take second place.

This year’s team has suffered several setbacks, but
still has the potential to turn a successful season.

season.

Bests Yardage Mark;
Interception Record

Earlier in the season, Gene set
a return yardage record and has
now picked up 128 yards on 8 pass
thefts. Also he is only 2 shy of
breaking the single season record
for interceptions

Luccarelli credited his free safety
position as the key reason for his
great number of pass thefts.

“As a free safety, I have no one
in particular to cover and can
watch the quarterback. Most col-

ge passers are unable to look one

y and pass another so I can get
2 clue to where the pass is going
y watching his eyes.”

Due to several injuries to de-
fensive backs the past few games,
“Luke” has been switched to corner-
back, giving him a definite man to
cover. He expects that his inter-
ception opportunities will decrease
as a result, in the final three games
of the season

Gene considers agility as the most
important asset for a defensive
halfback.

“Quick reactions more than sheer
speed are important in covering a
receiver. The offensive man knows
where he is going, so for the de-
fensive back it is just a question of
recovering from the receivers

fakes.”

As well as playing defensive back,
Luccarelli also runs back punts and
kickoffs. He terms communication
with the other deep man as vital in
kick and punt returns. “Luke” ex-
pressed disappointment however
that the Bisons have not been able
to break any punt returns for long

can pull a fast break at any time.

Coach Russell feels that ball handling and water
polo “‘instinct’’ have been spotty, but seem to be on the
upswing.

The club has rolled up some fine statistics. In seven-
teen games the club has averaged 14.7 goals a game,
with the A team alone averaging 16.9. The opposition
has averaged 9.5 goals per game.

Fouls have hurt the Bisons in several games this
year, but they have actually been outfouled by the op-
position, The Club has fouled an average of 18.0 per
game, while they have been fouled an average of 19.5 a
game.

The scoring leader is, of course, co-captain Paul
Landes. In the twelve games he has played in, Landes
has scored 55 goals. Second high scorer is Steve Win-
nings with 30, followed by Peter O’Keeffe with 26.

The race for the fouling lead is very close. Dyke
Edwards heads the pack with 32, but hot on his heels
are Duke Otto with 30, Bob Richards with 29, Winnings
with 28, and Landes with 25.

One fine figure does not seem very impressive, how-
ever: the won-lost mark of 9-8. Cornell, Army, and Yale
have all beaten the A team twice, and the B team has
lost to Cornell and the A team. This weekend the club
will get their last,
proving this figure.

among white students who were actively concerned with

changing society, there was an increased tendency to consume
drugs that produce euphoria and sharply altered and decreased the

perception of reality.”

Whites apparently do not share black’s

hostility towards heroin, and, in addition, are rebelling against ‘the

University Makes ‘Special Effort’
In Recruitment of Black Faculty

By LYNDA ROSCOE

Leon Pacala, Dean of the college
of Arts and Sciences, said this week
that the University will make
“special effort’ to consider as
many black candidates as possible
for faculty positions in the depart-
ments where vacancies are likely
to occur next year.

The Dean’s statement came after
a meeting with the sub-committee
on Afro-American studies and the
affected department heads.

Pacala, in commenting on the
meeting last week, said that, “In
recruiting by those departments in
which staff vacancies will be av-
ailable next year, special effort will
be made to consider as many black
candidates as possible.”

The departments involved are
those of English, Sociology, Psy-
chology, Political Science, Music,
Foreign Languages, and Education.

The departments of Mathematics
and Natural Sciences were exclud-
ed because of the unliklihood of
black studies being offered in these
subjects.

his works on display in the second floor gallery of the library.

Geiger Has Key to Locked Door

By NANCY GRDEN

“The Federal Reserve Relocation
Office is just like an insurance
policy,”” explained Mrs. Walter C.
Geiger, manager of the Center lo-
cated in Roberts Hall. “You hate
to have the expense in time and
money that it requires, but, in an
emergency, you are glad that you
made the investment.”

That is, in essence, the purpose of
the Relocation Office. It is an al-
ternate base of operations for the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadel-
phia, and it serves as a repository
for vital records.

* It is also an administrative head-
quarters for information and ser-
vice. No money is stored here.

Through the records of daily
transactions sent each day to the
Center, it is possible to reconstruct
the accounts for the banks in the
third district.

If for any reason the Band of
Phi ladelphia could not operate,
such as in a time of emergency,
the Relocation Office could serve
to advise and assist the banks and
businesses in the district so that
they could continue to operate.
This emergency planning is under

the general jurisdiction of the
Treasury Department and the Fed-
eral Reserve System.

Also, even though the Center does
not contain all of the intricate infor-
mation that is kept in Philadel-
phia, it could reconstruct this in-

formation on the basis of the vital
records stored in the Center.

The Relocation Office is present-
ly leasing space from the Univer-
sity in the basement of Roberts
Hall. However, according to John
Zeller, Vice President of Business
and Finance, the University may
not renew the lease for the Reloca-
tion Office, which will terminate in
a few years.

The University needs the space
for expanding its own facilities, and
the space would be used for what-
ever is most urgently needed for
when the lease expires.

When the Relocation Office first
moved here, it was located on the
second floor of the Carnegie Build-
ing, over the Bookstore, in a room
used by the University as storage
space. It rented this area from 1955
to 1961.

When the University needed more
space for the Geology Department,
the Center moved out of the Car-
negie Building into the basement of
Roberts Hall.

It incorporated space that had
been vacated by the University’s
duplicating machine department
and the post office when they

When asked about the meeting,
Professor Harvey Powers, chair-
man of the Sub-committee, re-
ported that no specific recommen-
dations had been made to the
chairmen of those departments in
which a likelihood of openings for
new professors existed

Instead, they had informally dis-
cussed “the desirability of trying
to hire several black professors,
rather than only one, next year.”

“One of the reasons behind this
particular approach,” Professor
Powers explained, “is the recogni-
tion that in the past, individual de-
partments have unsuccessfully tried
to hire black professors,”

“One reason for their lack of
success,” he continued, “‘was that
the prospective candidate did not
want to be the first and only black
member of the faculty.”

Professor Powers then stated
that an informal recommendation
had therefore been made for a con-
certed effort in hiring more than
one black professor.

A second topic discussed at the
meeting, he reported was ‘‘the pos-
sibility of hiring one black faculty
member specifically as a co-ordi-
nator or consultant who would give
us guidance in establishing a Black
Studies program at Bucknell.”

“The committee,” he explained,
“had been established to study the
problem of a Black Studies pro-
gram at Bucknell and to then make
recommendations.”

Incorporation into appropriate
courses of hitherto neglected di-
mensions of the black existence
has been suggested by the com-
mittee an an interim measure.

He also mentioned the possibility
of establishing courses in Black
Literature, History of the Black
Man, and urban politics. An inter-
departmental or inter-disciplinary
major might be devised from such
courses.

The sub-committee is currently
working on the polls submitted to
the Faculty and the ABS. Profes-
sor Powers commented that ““Hope-
fully more recommendations will
be forthcoming from what we will
have found in the polls.”

moved into their new locations in
Marts Hall. The Center moved into
these quarters in July of 1961.

The Center paid for the costs of
all improvements in the space rent-
ed. This includes the moderniza-
tion of one large room used for
general office purposes and storage
of records, and the renovation of
several storage areas into rooms
used for conferences and for keep-
ing office equipment and teletype
machines. These improvements
then become a part of the property
of the University.

The Relocation Office also makes
every attempt to avoid imposing
on the University. Any services
done for the Center and any use of
the facilities of the University, such
as the computer center, duplicating
the computer center, duplicating
services, etc., are paid for by the
Federal Reservé Bank.

The policy of the Center in this
respect is “Do not make a request
or use the University facilities if it
interferes with the University’s
needs - the University first.”

Before moving into its present
location, the Center was located at
Ursinus College, but it was moved

He stressed that the sub-com
mittee is not charged with the hir-
ing of black professors. Rather this
can only be done on the depart-
mental level with the approval of
the Dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences and the Provost.

Professor Powers pointed out the
tight market on black scholars now
existing, due to the fact that they
are being sought by every reputable
university. He noted that efforts to
arrange exchange professorships
for black professors here as an in-
terim measure had been success-
ful because of the present. short
age.

ing student programs has been set

ABS: The Uninformed

After attending several meetings of
the Association of Bucknell Students a
person could get very discouraged. The
members of the ABS are supposed to be
the representative voice of the student
body. They, above all others, should be
knowledgeable concerning the affairs of
the University. It is obvious that no one
can make intelligent decisions unless he
has full and complete understanding of

the situation.

However, it is clear

FEEDBACK: Diploma

To the Editor:

It is my sad lot to relate to all
of you still gathered on the hill of
fearning a tale of such sorrow that
it grieves me to even contemplate
its telling. Oh, it’s not my story
Let me make that clear. But,
rather, it is the story of a friend
who finds himself incapable of any
type of communication with his
friends at the moment. Yet surely
his tale must be heard.

It seems our friend was destined
to become enshrined by Bucknell
University as one fit to enter the
world of real life, vintage nine-
teen hundred and seventy. Being
fully humbled by the thought (how
well I can attest to that!), our man-
to-be gathered what strength he
had remaining after four long and
tiring years and headed for Marts
Hall.

Why you ask? Our friend was not
known as a lover of white shirts
and ties and freshly starched smil-
ing faces and well he knew their
wily ways. They had been known to
perform unnatural deeds before and
surely now there was no reason to
suspect that they would perform
otherwise.

But what is his wish? Why is our
friend venturing into Marts? With
what burning question on his lips?
Lead us on no further!. The answer,
dear friends, is a simple one. He
merely wished to know if there
were any reprecussions to fellow
him all the rest of the days of his
life should he decide that the over-
whelming grandeur of the actual
ceremony into manhood was too
much for his frail sensibility to
endure. Should he decide,mind you.
Being, as I said, well accustomed
with their ways, our friend knew to
phrase the question very indirectdy
(the windows at Marts merely
create the illusion of speaking di-
rectly to the person on the other
side)

Much to our comrade’s lack of
surprise, there was indeed a grave,
grave penalty to be endured. To
whit: the very symbol of manhood
itself (curious that it should be
called a sheepskin) was to be with-
held!. Attendance was mandatory!
(Honor, I have read somewhere, is
never to be bestowed on those who
seek it).

Where was our comrade to turn?
Fortunately, there were appeal
rights, as our friend learned. One
could, if one so desired, climb the
Marts Hall ladder (the same one,
not so surprisingly, that the office-
holder had climbed before you so
as to arrive there ahead of you
and be there when you get there).

Fortunately also, the ladder at
Bucknell is considerably shorter
than at many other similar insti-
tutions. Unfortunately, but seem-
ingly justified, taking all into ac-
count, one is rewarded according
to the distance one has climbed.
Therefore our friend was not un-
duly surprised to discover that the
view from the top of the short
Jadder revealed the door of the of-
fice of the provost.

Before I go on, a few words, with
your kind permission, about the
state of mind of our warrior as he
prepares to do battle with the
king’s right hand man. He was, in
a word, incensed (lovely word!).

Humility, to his ever more fur-
jous mind, was to be acknowledged,

even by those who possessed none;
one had the right not to be honored
(suspecting very strongly, as he
did, that a close examination might
reveal that the chalice contained
not wine but dirty, polluted Sus-
quehanna River water). He had
every intention of demanding the
aforementioned rights, dear friends,
but alas! a most uncanny twist of
linguistic fate robbed him of his
very breath!

What I mean to say is that the
provost’s finely honed mind was at
its peak. Upon receiving our furious
warrior into his den, he promptly
proceeded with several bold and
masterful strokes of logic to whit-
tle our comrade into a mere pile
of shavings, helpless before his
master. (Masters, of which the pro-
vost is surely one, are a mest
curious phenomenon, it will surely
be agreed.)

A friend once remarked to me
that it is as if masters controlled
the rain and, if one decided that he
would like to remain dry, the
masters would kindly allow you to
seek shelter. Nay, they would even
lead you to shelter. Having found
same, they would then only ask-for
their just reward. To whit: you
must allow the rain to fall on you
inside your shelter. You are then
only left with the rather curious
metaphysical task of decisions
whether or not you are wet!

But I stray from my tale. Indeed
I must hurry, lest my story remain
untold due to my fondness for dis-
tractions. Perhaps I would be pur-
suing the most direct course if I
attempted to recreate that infamous
conversation that took place that
day, as it was related to me later
on that evening. Our gallant com-
rade knocked on the door, received
admittance, and has sat down.
Here, if my memory serves me
faithfully, is basically what fol-
lowed:

Provost: What seems to be the
problem?

Friend: No problem at all. Just a
matter of preservation of my
freedom of choice (He’s lost the
provost already, poor lad)

Provost: Oh?

Friend: I really don’t care to at-
tend graduation exercises.

P: Well that’s no problem. You
don’t have to come. I can’t see
why you wouldn’t want to though;
it’s really a lovely ceremony.

F: I have my reasons but they are
personal and I really don’t care
to go into them. But that is not
the issue. The issue is simply that
I will not be forced to attend a
ceremony that is supposed to be
for me.

P: And you don’t have to.

F:I was told downstairs that I
wouldn’t get my diploma.

P: That’s right. You won’t get until
the next batch are shipped out.

F: When's that?

P: Next January.

F: But why?

P: Well, you are showing no par-
ticular interest in getting it, why
should we be so interested in get-
ting it to you? (If you could have
only seen the look in our friend’s
eyes as he related that particular
line to me)

F: I’m not interested in the di-
ploma. You know, I could care
less about that worthless piece of
paper. It’s useless, right?

P: Oh yes, I quite agree.

F: So let’s not fool ourselves that
you're really punishing me as
far as the diploma is concerned.

P: Fine.

F:Well, if we’re agreed on that,
then why is the administration
trying to punish me by withhold-
ing something that’s of no value?

P: Listen, as long as the diploma
is of no value to you, then just
skip the ceremony. Our policy
isn’t adversely affecting you.

F: But I demand to get my diploma
at the same time as the others do

P: Why?

F: Because I’ve earned it and you
have no right to keep it from me.

P:But we're already agreed that
it’s useless so there’s nothing to
get excited about.

As is by now plain to the ob-
server, our friend had found him-
self in quite a semantic pickle. How
to talk about the diploma and yet
not talk about the diploma at all?
How indeed. Our friend later re-
marked to me that he knew he was
speaking logically and coherently
and yet he felt extremely frustrated
fer he seemed to exert no influence
over his own words.

But, upon leaving the provost’s
office, our friend must have cer-
tainly become aware of an aspect
of the conversation that had not
struck him while he was in the of-
fice. For he was seen and heard
immediately following his ordeal
chuekling to himself and possessed
of a very strange glint in his eye
(at least that is what I have been
told by someone who saw him in
the halls of Vaughan Lit.)

Anyway, our friend was so en-
tirely bemused by the episode that
he decided to drop the issue right
there. Believe me, I tried my best
to get him to press the issue further
and obtain some justice but he
wouldn’t hear of it. He only smiled
and asked me to kindly forget it
and mumbled something about jus-
tice not being the only satisfaction
open to him. Very strange.

And so our friend sits and waits
patiently for that cold January
morning when the postman will
deliver unto him his diploma (third
class, no doubt) and then, clothed
in manhood, he can begin his life’s
work in confidence. He is spending
many hours in the gym these days,
preparing his body for the strug-
gle.

And why do I presume that you
will be at all interested in this
tale? Well, perhaps you too would
appreciate the strange, unworldly
pleasures that seem to come from
a talk with the administration on
this topic (and perhaps others, too,
I don’t know). But perhaps there
are some of you less given to seek-
ing strange delights and are more
inclined to forthright action. Per-
haps you wil understand these
words of mine as a challenge, as a
clarion call to action. May I say
it? That is indeed my wish.

(If Sol Linowitz was Charlie’s
gift to the Class of ’70, one can
only surmise that he is running out
of friends and one can only shudder
to think of his 1971 selection!)

I’m not sure what our mistreated
friend would counsel you, were he
in any condition to speak with you.
But perhaps someday when he fully
regains his powers of mind and

j/ THE SIDESHOW

The Politics of Apathy

By DAVID WEINBERGER

Political apathy has been both justified and attacked. In fact, how-
ever, there is a form of political withdrawal that appears as apathy but
isn’t. This phenomenon may be the most legitimate form of political

activity.

There are at least three modes of political involvement, that is, ac-
tivity attempting to implement one’s concept of the way things Should
Be. First, one can work entirely within the system by campaigning for
candidates. Or one can take a “half-way” stance (no prejorative is in-
tended) and be a civil disobedient with the consequent implication that
one is ready to take the consequences meted out by the system. Or one
can move entirly out of the system in different ways.

In the Spring of ’68, a fairly small percentage of the student body
seemed interested in politics at all. An even smaller number were ready
to go halfway out of the system. These were the radicals at the time. The
climate of the campus that fall was such that people with sideburns past
their ears were yelled at by Fraternity Men in Cars who could be stereo~
typed a lot more easily than they can be today.

These radicals sat-in against the military recruiters. The issue of
recruitment on campus became buried under the issue of the permis-
sibility of a sit-in. The University hurriedly decided that activities that
obstruct official University functions like military recruitment, were not.
permissible. At the time of the first sit-in nobody could be sure that they
were outside or within the system. When it turned out that they were
outside, they (we?) stopped. We refused to go outside of the system
enough to be a civil disobedient because, in most cases, we were not
willing to take the consequences.

That Fall, about 400 radicals “disrupted” the ROTC Presidential Re-
view. The disruption consisted of antics, like mocking the troops as they
marched by marching around them and behind them. We went outside
the system because we were confident that the system would not penal-
ize 400 of us. But that means that we were still within the system: is was
not that the system could not do anything about us, but that it decided
that it would be easier for itself if it did not. It is ironic that that week-

end saw the first draft card burnings, courageous acts which were truly

out of the system.

Then there was also the Coalition which presented “proposals,” strictly
within the system, although the self-deceptive mood was that we were
really being daring and defiant. At the time, perhaps we were.

The Strike last year was an interesting case of working totally within
the system. The system absorbed us, and we absorbed it. And the work
was done within the larger political system.

Very recently some sophomores announced, and thereby created, a
demonstration against military recruitment. They were within the System
in that they did not break rules, but they were out of it because their
method was that of antics.

One of the points is that many of us, in the last few years, did as
much as we could within the system and realized that more was neces-
sary. It was necessary to go out of the system someway, whether hailf-
way or totally. In a sense, there is a “generation gap’”” between some of
those of us who have not yet prosecuted the system within the system
to the limit, and those of us who have. But they are starting by using
antics, which is a step ahead of where we started with the sit-ins.

Of course the important question is which way is best. The phrase
“halfway out of the system” is not intended negatively at all. How can
we feel contempt for someone who is brave enough to put himself on the

line when we weren’t? And because ‘‘outside of the system” defines it-

self negatively what where it is not, the variety of ways. to be outside the
system is enormous. It is obvious, however, that many of those who claim
to be outside the system are really within it. “Shoot all the perpetrators.
of violence,” can only be said by someone who has the system inside him
and hence cannot really withdraw from it.

Many people this year have totally dropped out o! “politics” in the
sense of trying to get someone else to subscribe to one’s. own views. They
have settled into themselves and their quiet circles of friends admist ac-
cusations of “Apathy” and “Hedonism.” In fact, being cecksure of one’s
goal, even a goal as easy to believe in as “peace,” is passibly the worst
type of egotism. After going to the edge of within-the-system policies and
backing away from the personal sacrifice necessary to take a halfway-
out stance, they are pulling themselves together before they go out to
try to pull the world together. The first question we alk have to answer
is, “Why didn’t and why don’t, we commit ourselves, body and soul?”

Hopefully, someday

we will know.

It took us a while to learn that politics begins at home.

cording to Hammerlee:

(1) the proposed event should be
for the general interest of the uni-
versity community.

(2) funds should be requested at
least one month in advance of the
proposed event, so that publicity
ean be disseminated thoroughly.
Exceptional cases will be con-
sidered on shorter notice, but the
one month restriction will be gen-
erally observed.

3) the committee will discuss
with applicants for funds the pro-
jected scope of the program; de-

termine who is responsible for the
event; and may be in touch with
the responsible person(s) about
publicity and other arrangements
vital to the success of the program.

(4) Applicants for funds must
come as the representatives of a
recognized student organization.

(5) Committee funds will normal-
ly go toward non-profit events for

VOLUME LXXIII— NO. 19 FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1979

By KEN DOAK

The Red Raiders of Colgate jump-
ed out to a 35-0 second quarter lead
over the injury-riddled Herd Satur-
day, and coasted to a 44-14 triumph.
Coach Fred Prender accurately
summed up the BU performance
with “too many mistakes against
a very good football team.” :

The Bisons’ first offensive series
set the mood for the game, as Bill
Lane had his punt blocked deep in
BU territory.

On a fourth-down play, QB Steve
Goepel lobbed a 5-yard TD pass to
fullback Steve Morgan. Goepel then
booted his first of six PATs.

Following another Morgan-led TD
drive, Howard Burke injured his
foot attempting to pass. Greg Do-
viak’s first throw was intercepted
and run back to the 11

Two plays later, Morgan burst
through the left side on a trap play
for a 10-yard score.

Goepel upped the margin to 35-0
in the second quarter, as he con-
nected on TD strikes of 29 and 35

“ Doviak then led the Bisons to
their first score, as he schambled
46 yards down the right sideline.
A pas to Bob Ciperson at the 2 set
up a TD run by Mitch Farbstein
“BU gave Colgate their final 9
points in the third quarter. A safety
resulted from a bad snap from cen-
ter on a punt, and a fumble on the
1-yard lir t up a fourth TD by
Morgan, ty the Colgate record.

Greg Doviak has seen action on
both sides of the line of scrimmage
this year and has recently won
Coach Prender’s praise for his
play at safety.

The Herd then began to move the
football on numerous passes by
Doviak (who completed 20 of a
record 43 attempts), but had trouble
sustaining a drive.

They scored their final TD on an
80-yard march in the fourth quarter.
Two catches by Jay Griffin helped
move the ball to the 7, and Doviak
rolled left and cut into the end
zone.

By ALAN GROCHAL

Any hopes of an MAC soccer
championship were dashed last
Saturday, as the Bisons fell to Dela-
ware 3-0.

The offense, which has now
scored only two goals in the last
four games, continued to falter. The
pitchmen were outshot by over a
2 to 1 margin and only controlled
the ball in one quarter, the second.

Defensively, the Bisons also had
a letdown. Two of the three Dela-
ware goals were scored on defens-
ive lapses.

“The game was neither our
best nor worst performance of the
year. Several players played hurt,
but we can’t use that as an alibi.
Delaware simply played a smart
hustling game,’ Coach Craig Rey-
nolds observed. :

Throughout the scoreless first
quarter, the Bisons and Hens play-
ed evenly, with Delaware holding
a slight ball control edge.

The second period was domin-
atde by the Bisons, who utilized
short passes to control the ball.
Delaware scored however, with two
minutes left in the half on a fluke
goal. Normally a routine play, a
direct kick got by Bison goalie
Lloyd Ryysydanian.

The Hens added a second score

as the first year that an

against the teams in their division,
the polomen lost 7-4 to Harvard

and 10-6 to meme sis Cornell, be- |

McGill and Tom Powilson led the
Crimson with two apiece.

In their second game the club
faced Cornell, and this time were
no match for the Big Red in -their
own territory. Pete Carhart’s team
moved into an 8-3 lead after three
quarters, and a mild Bison come-
back s not enough.

Rick Marek scored 6 goals for
Cornell, while Paul Landes had five
and Dyke Edwards one for the
Bisons.

The final game against North-
eastern will be remembered more
for the setting than for the final
score. The game did not start un-
til 10:45 p.m., and the Bisons and
the Huskies seemed like they want-
ed to set a record for the latest
water polo game ever played.

The teams battled through four

quarters and two overtime periods |
before a goal by Greg Raven won |

the game in sudden death. The

teams climbed out of the pool at |

twelve thirty.

Meanwhile in the other division,
Army, Yale, M.LT.,and Cornell B |
team were blasting each other with
a vengeance. Army and Yale tore |
through their opponents, and in |
perhaps the best match of the en- |
tire tournament, the Eli topped the |
Cadets 11-9.

LEWISBURG
FRIENDS MEETING

Other teams to be eliminated
with the Bisons on Saturday were
Northeastern, M.LT., and the Cor-
nell B squad. In the Finals on Sun-
day, Yale stopped Harvard 18-5,
and Army whipped Cornell by a
suprisingly large margin, 16-6.

In the finals, Yale defeated Army
13-6.

Once again the Eli reign supreme
over Eastern water polo.

Coach Russell was disappointed
with the season record of 8-8, and
commented that the Bisons had a
lot of work to do on their ball
handling.

The team loses Rob Worthen,
Dean Hunt, Mike Huffman, and
Greg Raven due to graduation, but
still have plenty of firepower to
work with next year.

two minutes into the second half
on a jam-up in front of the Bison
goal. The ball popped in, giving
Delaware their second goal in four
minutes.

“These two quick goals forced
us to use a strong offensive forma-
tion in the fourth quarter. We ac-
tually looked worse when we used
this formation because the Dela-
ware fullbacks managed to clear
the ball downfield. well,’’ Coach
Craig Reynolds noted.

Delaware added their final goal in
the fourth quarter on a headed ball
after a corner kick.

Adding further to the pitchmen’s
woes was a third quarter ankle in-
jury to fullback Larry Greenwood,
probably sidelining him for the rest
of the season.

The Bisons meet Elizabethtown
Tuesday in a game which Coach
Reynolds calls, ‘‘as tough as either
Delaware or Penn State.”’ The sea-
son concludes this Saturday at home
with Lehigh in a game to decide
second place in the Mac.

Bison booter Bob Gibson has added
much to the Herd and has been
selected by Coach Reynolds as soc-
cer player of the week.

PRESS BOX

By DAN MILLER.

Coach Richard Schumacher, Director of Intramurals, has announced
that this year’s basketball tournament will be held on a different basis

than the other IM sports.

“On the premise that IM sports are for the average student the IM
Committee has decided to open a fifth league in addition to the four al-
ready in existance to to allow for greater participation by the University

community.”

The facts are these: any group of 13 people who chose to, can submit
their names as an IM basketball team. This excludes only the fraternities
(who can however, field a “‘B’’ team in addition to their regular entry,
and thefre shmen who will continue to play in hall groups.)

This experimental set-up will enable upperclass hall groups, graduate
students, and faculty to field squads. The requirements are that each team
file an official roster with Coach Schumacher with the names, class,
phone number, and campus address of 13 players, one of whom should be

appointed as team representative.

The squad should also pick a nickname to identify itself.
The deadline for the submission of this roster is 4:00 p.m., November

16.

The notion has been circulating the campus for some time that the IM
program does not serve enough of the Community; a concept that has
been linked to the curtailment of intercollegiate athletics.

This new proposal can be constructed as an effort to alleviate this
problem, by making the IM program more accessable to more people.
Schumacher has said that if this experiment is a success he would like
to see it extended to softball this spring and next year to the entire IM

program.

“The Band” won’t be outside on a bench on November 22. They will be

The ABS has passed a motion
asking the University to allow the
class of 1973 to have access to
Davis gym for a speech by William
Kuntsler

The renowned defense attorney
for the ‘Chicago’ trial in Chicago
earlier this year, was scheduled to
speak in the gym after the class of
°73 made special arrangements with
Robert A. Latour, director of ath-
letics.

According to Russ Pais, president
of the sophomore class, ‘the athletic
department has just been giving
us the run-around so that Kunstler
Will not be able to speak here.’

Pais and other students have been
negotiating with Latour since No-
vember 3, when Kunstler first ac-
cepted the invitation to appear on
campus.

Thursday of last week, Jack
Schmidt and Pete Doscher went to
see Smith.

They reported that he said he
was sorry but practice couldn’t be
re-scheduled because there were
some conflicts with labs. Smith
suggested that they find another
place.

When Latour was seen by Schmidt
and Doscher Friday morning, they
reported that he said that “‘it (the
use of the gym) couldn’t be ar-
ranged,’’ since Smith, with whom
Latour had talked Thursday, had
told Latour that he was against
changing practice.

Latour reiterated, according to

Schmidt, that the final decision was
Smith’s and agreed to leave it in
Smith’s hands.
“ That afternoon, Schmidt and Do-
scher spoke with Smith and told
him that Latour had left it up to
him, whereupon Smith agreed to
discuss the matter with the team
that night.

Thirteen out of fourteen players
on the team said they could make
an earlier practice.

Still without a final reply Monday,

The abolishment of the Committee
of Arbitration and clarification of
the budgetry powers of the Uni-
versity Senate were the main orders
of business at Wednesday’s special
ABS meeting to discuss the docu-
ment.

The ABS also added a function
to the Senate by creating a Com-
mittee on Informational Resources
to have jurisdiction over the book-
store, the library, and the computer
center and create the Office of In-
Structional Media.

According to the faculty-passed
Senate, if a piece of legislation is
returned to the Senate twice, by
the ABS or Faculty, it would go
to an Arbitration Committee, com-
posed of the Provost, and two Fac-
ulty members, and their decision
would be final.

The amendment would provide for

Latour Opposes Abolishment

President and John Dunlop, Dean of
Student Affairs felt that the idea of
a “Supreme Court” type of body
was a good one, and spoke against
the motion.

However, the Congress felt, as
Bob Nachshin said that if the Senate
as the policy making body, was to
really represent the desires of the
community as a whole, it must have

final say on matters within its jur-
isdiction.

After a motion to table the motion
for a week was defeated, the ques-
tion was called, and the amend-
ment passed, with four against,
and five abstaining.

A less controversial amendment
was also introduced by Nachshin,

Black Faculty Search
Encounters Difficulty

News Analysis
3y SUE BOLSTRUM

Much effort has been put into re-
cruiting Blacks for faculty posi-
tions, yet prospects for success ap-
pear dim. In talks with seven de-
partmental heads, many reasons
for this failure, and a few alterna-
tives were brought to light.

One of the most obvious but also
most difficult problems in common
to all job recruiters: finding some-
one who meets the qualifications.

In the Political Science Depart-
ment this means someone well
versed in International Relations,
for the Music Department, some-
one capable of teaching music
theory and also able to conduct
music or teach an instrument. (pre-
ferably string). The hology De-
partment needs someone with a full
professorship to replace Professor
Wendell Smith, who recently be-
came Provost

Besides the departmental de-
mands, the University would like to
see someone ready and willing to
coordinate a Black Studies Pro-
gram .

However, if the departmental
staff is small and overworked, the
question becomes “‘is it asking too
much for one person to assume both
jobs?”

Where to look for qualified in-
dividuals can also present difficul-
ties. If you go to the most likely
source, a predominately Black In-
stitution like Howard or Lincoln,
you are faced with the moral di-
lemma of robbing these schools of
valuable people.

On the other hand, shouldn’t the
question of loyalties be left up to
the individual?

In our attempt to understand and
improve Black-White relations, we
have been forced to discriminate
for Black, against White. Is this
justifiable, will it do more harm
than good, or is there a better way
to increase interaction between
races?

Though all but two of the seven
departmental chairmen said a
Black would have an advantage
over a White in their eyes, one had
serious misgivings about such a
compromise with reality.

He feared discrimination would
lead only to more alienation and
stressed sticking to one’s ideals.

Though some applicants have ser-
iously considered coming here, the

in an almost totally white com
munity reportedly has discouraged
them

One possible solution to many of
these problems was suggested by
Professor William Moore (Educa-
tion): an exchange program for
both students and faculty with
Black schools.

He also suggested that we con-
sider studying oppressed groups
per se so that we don’t end our
efforts to intergrate (understand?)
minorities with blacks.

Another alternative could be to
hire a Black Studies coordinator
using a grant from the Mellon
Foundation. In this way small de-
partments could avoid sharing a
member with a much more de
manding program

But according to the terms of the
Mellon grant the funds must be
used within five years. Thus the
University would be forced to find
a substitute fund to retain anyone
hired on this grant.

As another alternative the Music
Department recently received a
grant to hire qualified personnel

a one-semester or one-year

is. Professor Warner saw this
as a conceivable way to get Black
musicians or teachers onto the
Music Department staff, if only for
a short term

ABS Recommends Gym Courses

The Congress of the Association
@ Bucknell Students, passed and
sent to the Provost a motion call-
ing on the physical education de-
partment to institute courses cover-
ing ‘specific areas of that depart-
ments discipline.’

The motion, which was tabled
last week, is a corollary to one al-
ready passed by the ABS asking
the University faculty to abolish
the requirement that 4 semesters
of gym be taken by all students.

Commenting on the proposal
yesterday the director of athletics
said, “speaking for the department
I would have to say that I oppose

the abolishment of the requirement,
because of what I think it would do
to our Physical education program.
I know of cases where they have
put a system like this into opera-
tion, at schools the size of Bucknell,
and now for all intents and pur-
poses they have no physical educa-
tion program.”

He continued, “I think that I
should add that I have been work-
ing with my staff for the past year
to try and develop a system which
will offer the student more of a
choice of what he takes in phys. ed.
Beginning in February, we hope to
institute a program whereby the

student will be able to choose what
he takes in class much like the
women’s program is now.

“We will try and have as many
choices as possible and there will be
no division between freshmen and
sophomores. In this way we hope to
increase the variety and choice in
the department.”

The motion to establish classes in
phys. ed., after the abolishment of
the present requirement was in-
troduced by Jim Ludwig.

The motion, which passed unani-
mously says in part, “The ABS re-
quests that the following recom-

Censure Latour

Robert Latour, director of athletics, must be cen-
sured by the entire University for his actions this past
week. The deceitfulness that he has demonstrated over
the past few days is distressing. It seems that he has
made every effort to thwart students interested in mak-
ing use of the Gym for a cultural event, and his actions
are inexcusable. He has single-handedly sought to block
the use of the Gym next week for the speech to be de-

livered by William Kuntsler.

We demand that the Gym

be made available for next week’s talk. The news story

speaks for itself.

Whose Hair?

The problem of group allegiance vs.
individual conscience must be faced and
resolved frequently. ‘Unbelievably, this
issue came into view when a member of
the varsity basketball team was forced
recently between keeping his hair long
and being dropped from the squad.

The player, who asked to remain
nameless, was told by coach Donald
Smith either to cut his hair or not come
to the next practice. The player did not
think enough of the issue to pursue it
and quit the team.

Since this situation has arisen be-
fore, The Bucknellian wanted to investi-
gate an athlete’s possibilities or resolv-
ing such an issue procedurally. A letter
was sent to Provost Wendell I. Smith
who answered, “The student should ap-
peal to the Director of Athletics and if
the issue is not resolved at that level

ROSENCRANTZ & GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD
BY TOM STOPPARD
126 PAGES. NEW YORK: GROVE PRESS.
1967. PAPER. $.95

Visualize Hamlet’s world as a geometrical plane carrying his life
through its development, climax, and denouement. His fellow tragedians
have worlds of their own, but we know nothing of their life-planes except
where they intersect with that of Hamlet’s. If one started at one of the
planes and followed it through, he would find the development (climax and
donouement) of another world, another tragedy.

Rozencrantz is not simply the tracing of two of these planes and the
record of their intersection. It is rather the attempt, on the part of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to decipher how they came to be placed in
the play. Of course, they can make decisions but never do they have a
they cannot escape. The protagonists realize they they are but pawns;
players who can only act out their lives in accordance with the plan of
the play. Of course, they can make decisions but never do htey have a
choice. “We are free,” Rosencrantz intones. “Within limits,” Guilden-
stern replies, ‘ , of course within limits.”

After all, R and G are children of our time and as such undergo those
traumas with which we are so well acquainted. As they are relentlessly
pushed and shoved by the un, sub-or supernatural forces which guide
them, they breathe the air of a fatalism not unlike a man who knows that
that which he has feared most is finally occurring at hand. When it
happens there is no place to go, no place to hide. Guildenstern precisely
makes the point, ‘‘We’ve travelled too far, and our momentum has taken
over; we move idly towards eternity, without possibility of reprieve or
hope of explanation.”

What Mr. Stoppard has done is to synthesize a precis of twentieth
century existence and woven this essence around and through the frame-
work of Hamlet. His play, his first major work, has been enthusiastically
received and already (it was written three years ago) it is being per-
formed regularly along side the works of Shakespeare. It is a very im-
portant play, and it will be around for quite a while to attest to this fact.
For its full impact it should be read as well as viewed, and read rather
carefully. As you can well imagine, it is not a fun play to read. One
could say that it is all too accurate to be enjoyed; it is depressing. Its
essence can best be summarized in Stoppard’s own words, “Life is a
gamble, at terrible odds—if it was a bet you wouldn’t take at?

The Doctor’s Bag

QUESTION? Can going bra-less hasten the time when breasts begin to
sag? Or cause them to sag more?

ANSWER: Breasts have very little connective tissue and are dependent
on underlying muscles to carry their weight. The organ itself is pri-
marily fatty tissue and, incidently, small breasts contain the same amount
of milk producing glands as large breasts. It is considered inadvisable
for women with large breasts to go around continually without bras,
especially if engaging in physical activity, as stretching of the skin and
weakening of supportive structures can occur. According to one source,
horse-back riding can be particularly wicked.

Women are especially cautioned to wear good supportive brassieres
during pregnancy when breasts enlarge. Similar breast enlargement can
occur when women take birth control pills, so the same warning should
apply. Women with smaller breasts and good muscle support should have
little fear in going bra-less. A friend’s wife suggests the following test:
Place a pencil under the breast parallel to the chest wall at the point
where the breast joins the chest. Let go of the pencil. If the pencil does
not fall, going bra-less is not recommended. If the pencil falls, the choice
is yours.

Letters to the Editor

Rod’s Running
To the Editor:

Although I am a Junior, I feel
that it is incumbent upon me to
once more run for Freshman class
president, as I did last year and
the year before. I refuse to move
on to the more difficult challenges
of Sophomore and Junior class
president without some basic ex-
perience leading the freshman class
by the knows. Experience lets us
know that we’ve done things before,
which is indeed good to know.

Unlike my opponents, I refuse to
aim my campaign at the Great
Silent Pejorative, which is quietly
wimpering like some weak, pitiful
giant in our nation’s 190 year proud
history. Weak, perhaps. But piti-
ful? Never! Tike the pits from
Bucknell, so that we can all be
soft core.

There is an over-riding question
of University formulation that must
be dealt with squarely, so that we
won’t have to be divided by ad-
ditional positive determined num-
bers subtracting from the multi-
plicity of our ranks. I have worked
that formula out and have come up
with an alternative to the proposed
University Senate: the answer is 3.

Three expresses the basic struc-
ture of the Universe: Us, Them and
We. Or We. Us, and It. Three
throughout history has represented
everything that has come in more
than pairs and less than enough to
place one at each corner of a table.
‘And isn’t that what this University
is: Somewhat more than a pair, but
certainly less than a card-table.

If elected, I promise to personally
visit Gamma Upsilon Doowah to
cut an end to the malignant ‘‘scout-
ing parties.” Two freshman have
been permanently tie-dyed already
this year, and one’s aqualung broke
when we tried to get him out of the
tv set. This has got to stop.

RIGHT ON

Academic Orthodox
By WAYNE J. et

STEVE KELMAN, A Democratic Socialist of the Michael Harrington
school, has some interesting comments on his fellow Harvard students
in his book, Push Comes to Shove. In speaking of the SDS influence over
Harvard students, he observed:

“Unreality doesn’t, however, incubate automatically be-

cause of a favorable environment. Concrete steps must

be taken to disorient students from any sort of bearings ©

or points of reference to reality. Black must be made to

appear white, two plus two equal five. This task is easier

because most students come to Harvard without very

definite or strong political beliefs . . . Most Harvard stu-

dents will confess to changing their minds back and forth

depending on which side’s polemic they read last. . ts
Students come to Harvard, as they do Wayne State or Valley Junior
College, without a concise view of political reality or a developed ideo-
logical outlook towards the values on which society and its government
should be based. Think back to your high school years and your own view
of politics. Most of us had no personal foreign policy or well-developed
stand on universal medical care. We entered collegiate life ready to
learn, to become familiar with the great issues of man and the state,
to know of where we could find meaning and then come to our own con-
clusions as to Truth.

Yet, this is too often not the situation on American campuses today.
It is interesting to note how SDS gained hold of the political beliefs of
many Harvard students. Kelman explains the manner in which maty
students found their political answers.

«when political beliefs are molded merely on the basis

of reading and talking and not on the basis of experience,

it becomes relatively easy to change students’ minds by

exposing them to a constant diet of one side only . . . This

pressure, all from one side is constant and takes its toll.”
Harvard is no different in this respect than most American college cam-
puses. Nor does the indoctrination come only from SDS. Witness the
results of a recent faculty opinion survey by the Carnegie Commission
on Higher Education, which polled over sixty thousand faculty members
in all academic fields. It found that forty-seven percent of all faculty
members (in all fields) considered themselves Left or Liberal and only
twenty-four percent labelled themselves Moderate or strong conservatives.
Over eighty percent in Sociology, seventy-one percent in Political Science,
seventy-seven percent in Philosophy, and sixty-eight percent in History,
classified themselves as Liberal or Left. Corresponding figures for Mod-
erate or Strong Conservatives were Sociology five percent, Political Sci-
ence nine percent, Philosophy, eight percent, History twelve percent.

It is no wonder that the discussion on campus too often become
framed in terms of liberal versus radical. As Professor Stephen Tonsor
has commented, ‘‘The ideological and cultural uniformity of higher edu-
cation in America is a disgrace .. - Our colleges and universities have
conformed themselves over the past two decades to the orthodoxy of sec-
ular liberalism.

How many conservatives teach on your faculty? Is Kirk, Voegelin,
or even Burke read in your Political Theory courses? Are Friedman,
Von Mises, and Allen discussed in your Economics courses? When was
the last time a conservative case against our present welfare policies
was discussed in your Sociology courses? Unfortunately, the Balanced
University, presenting all views in its search for Truth, exists on too few
American campuses. Students must express their own independence and
search for differing ideas from the liberal orthodoxy of the academy. One
wonders what has happened to the practice of academic freedom by those
who so loudly proclaim their adherence to the principle.

Zeller Explains Budget Deficit;
Expects Expenditure Increase

By JOHN DE BENEDICTIS

The Vice-President of business
and finance, John F. Zeller, assur-
ed students, Tuesday, that the Uni-
versity would not go bankrupt, de-
spite last year’s $370,000 deficit.

Zeller’s lecture sponsored by
Concern Through Action, was held
in New Dorm Pit to enlighten the
students as to the nature of the
University’s financial situation.

The deficit suffered last year was
the first in the school’s history al-
though, in Zeller’s words, “it’s been
nip and tuck the past couple years.””
The deficit resulted from unexpect-
ed expenditures for library facili-
ties, science equipment, and physi-
cal plant costs

The most alarming unbudgeted
expense was the loss of $20,000 in
equipment due to theft.

Other contributing factors to the
debt were the stock market drop,
a drop in gains from contracted re-
search, and the cut-down in scholar-
ship grants. Bucknell y unaf-

pected to undergo a seven Pp er-cent

jority of this increase will go to-
wards salaries, maintenance of the

plant, and construction of

Zell d that the school would
require another $750,000 for opera-
tion this year and that state and
federal government assistance, en-
dowments, and gifts would not
cover the increased cost of operat-
ing the campus. Therefore, he went
on, tuition or more students are re-
quired to balance the budget.

KKM IIE,

In an address last week to the
faculty, President Watts indicated
that there would be no reductions
in staff or cutbacks in salary and
went further to say that modest
salary increases would be consider-
ed.

Much of the problem in predict-
ing university expenditures arises
from the inability of the university
to accurately predict the size and
the needs of each entering fresh-
man class. Policy usually offers
admission to 1500 students expect-
ing only 750 to accept and, in the
same way, up to $350,000 in scholar-
ships are offered expecting only
$150,000 of them to be used.

As has happened with this year’s
freshman class, an unexpected 50
students have accepted entrance.
Although this means extra capital
for the university, it also means
greater expense for scholarships
and for maintenance of facilities.
Extra students beneficial as
long an additional staff or facilitites
are uni Jed 7

The university will not be ex-
pecting aid from the federal or
state governments, or private cor-
porations and therefore can no
longer afford to expend indefinitely.

Despite serious setbacks such as
rising insurance costs, lowered in-
come from the federal government
for contracted research and increas-
ed remodeling and construction
costs, the university does not plan
on a deficit for the coming year

ill do it’s best to prevent
such an occurence in the future.

Happenings of Note

New Courses
Engineering Planning 330, offered
by the Civil Engineering Depart-
ment, is a lecture-seminar course
which will team up one engineering
student and one non-engineering
student to study various engineer-
ing projects, successful and unsuc-
cessful, and to devise and justify
some new system. Robert Brun-
graber, professor of civil engineer-
ing and the course sponsor, also
plans to have a series of five or six
seminars featuring successful gov-
ernment and industrial planners.

The other course, Engineering
250 - Modern Technology, is not
listed in the Class Schedule. Offered
by the chairmen of the four engin-
eering departments - Coder, Brun-
graber, Slonaker, and Walker - the
course is designed for all students,
but it is not open to engineering
majors. It will be offered MWF,
9:00 - 10:00, and will be a survey of
the principles, practice, and phil-
osophy of engineering, and will in-
clude a discussion of both the po-
tentials and limitations of engineer-
ing towards the solution of the prob-
lems of an ever-expanding tech-
nological society.

everything was O.K.

Tuesday, Smith acknowledged
that he was satisfied when the class
representatives returned to see him.

All that remained was for Latour
to sign a form. Latour wasn’t in
Tuesday afternoon.

Pais returned to Latour with
Smith’s authorization and was in-
formed that the gym had already
been reserved by the intramural
swim meet. ‘

Latour said, ‘‘Coach Schumacher,
(director of intramurals) had
originally scheduled the meet for
Tuesday and Wednesday not realiz-
ing that the Artist Series was a
concert type affair. (this is Schu-
macher’s first year here) Mr. Schu-
macher agreed to change the meet
to Monday and Wednesday.”

The director of athletics went on
to say, “I don’t think that having
a swimming meet next door, with
all the crowd and sounds of starters
guns would be very conducive to a
speech in the gym.”

Pais has scheduled meetings with
other University officials in an ef-
fort to find a way to reserve the
gym for the speech.

When asked about holding the
speech in another location Pais
commented, ‘‘all the other locations
on campus are too small for the
size of the crowd we're expecting.

Commenting on the fact that Pais
had charged that the athletic de-
partment was giving the sophomore
class the run-around Latour said,
“We're not trying to give anyone
the run-around. People come in
here every day expecting us to
change our schedule to fit the rest
of the campus. I have nothing
against Kunstler speaking on cam-
pus, but I don’t think Mr. Pais is
taking into account many factors
which we have to consider.”

In this vein, an amendment from

Jeff Sengsteck, Senior Class Presi-

might be advisable since some facet
might be distasteful to the Senate
then, which when considered pre-

The whole issue was clarified, /
however, when in response to a

Dunlop stated that even if the Sen-
ate was empowered to deal with
the budget before adoption, it would
only have the last three weeks in

impracticable, and the amendment
to “review before adoption” was

RESIN TE

By JACKIE STUBBA

Features Editor’s Note: This
article is the second in a series of
interviews with department chair-
men regarding the ratio of stu-
dents to faculty. The professors ad-
dressed themselves to such ques-
tions as: What is the present ratio
and how has it compared over the
past fey years? Is the department
understaffed? Does this affect the
quality of education the students
are receiving? This week’s inter-
views include the departments of
biology, English, and physics.

e* *

Professor J. H Harcelrode,
chairman of the biology depart-
ment, expressed much concern over
the high student-faculty ratio in his
department. The classroom situa-
tion varies-some ratios are 20:1 or
30:1, but he commented that it is
not unusual to have 60-100 students
in one class.

Enrollment in the introductory
course for non-majors alone total
to 270 students — all taught by one
professor. With only eight staff
members and 330 majors he stated,
“We are very critically under-
staffed in addition to teaching, the
advising load is approximately an
40:1 ratio.”

Professor Harclerode sees this
overload as a result of such a large
number of biology majors. “This
school attracts excellent students
and many come here especially for
our noted biology department. One
out of every nine students is a bio.
major.” he explained.

Accomodations for this large num-
ber have had to be made, “Seven

evenings because there isn’t enough
time in the day,”’ said Harclerode.
“This is the only science here that
has had to do that.”

Hiring four graduate and under-
graduates as lab teaching assist-
ants helps, but advising, writing
recommendations and reading lab
reports still requires a tremendous
amount of time.

Due to a limited budget, the Uni-
versity had to deny the request to
enlarge the staff. Yet, in spit of
an inadequate ratio of faculty mem-
bers, the professor considers the
quality of education that the stu-
dents receive to be excellent. He
stated, “This department has sent
the highest percent of majors on to
graduate school. Our average
major is in the top 8% of all biology
majors in the country.”’

Reasonable Ratio

Professor H. R. Garvin, of the
department of English, averaged
the introductory freshman ratio to
be slightly over 20:1. Most of the
upperclass courses have limited
their individual classes to a maxi-
mum of 30-35 students, though, in
many cases, it’s lower, which he
believes to be fairly reasonable.

Although it varies with each in-
dividual, Garvin estimated that a
faculty member spends 9 hours in
the classroom and 60-70 hours in
outside preparation and reading.

In addition, many of them advise
student projects (last year there
were about 50), involving a great
amount of work for which profes-
sors do not get credit. He explained,
“Tt’s a very hard-working depart-
ment but, in general, they don’t

complain about it, they just do it.
Members are worked to capacity
and more.”

Presently, the department is look-
ing for a permanent member to fill
an opening in the staff. Since last
spring, this position of assistant
professor has been temporarily fill-
ed by a lecturer. Realizing the need
in some other departments, Garvin
commented that the English de-
partment cannot further enlarge
its staff in the immediate future.

Physics: Not Understaffed

Professor R. W. Hendy, chair-
man of the physics department,
estimated the total physics enroll-

divide into groups of about 30:1,
but the upperclassmen attend clas-
ses of 10-15 students.

The physics staff spends much
time reading current library journ-
als and advising students, but Pro-
fessor Henry said the department
is not understaffed. “It’s under-

10-15 from each graduating class.

Although Henry sees no need for
more professors, he would like to
offer more courses to non-majors.
The A.B. program is more flexible,
now, and should offer “culture-type
courses, such as the Principles of
Physics, not overly technical, yet
expounding ideas.”

Some of the courses have com-
bined for next year, thus new ideas
for courses can be considered.

‘On the Other Side of the Desk’

Student Teachers Relate
Wide Experience Ranges

By JANET KOCH

This semester is something out of
the ordinary for forty-eight seniors
who are sitting on the other side of
the teacher’s desk.

They are student-teaching in area
schools, preparing for post-graduate
careers. Ten are teaching on the
elementary, and thirty-eight on the
secondary, levels. Their reactions
to their new educational environ-
ment are varied, but most seem to
agree on one thing — they like it,

For Mary Ellen Caccetta, teach-
ing first grade at the Mifflinburg
Elementary School is ‘“‘a lot more
difficult” than she expected, but
Mary Ellen also terms the experi-
ence “the most valuable education
course I’ve had here.” This idea
was echoed by Andy Hartman,
teaching American History at
Lewisburg High School, who said he
was “learning more from being a
teacher. It makes you much more
aware of the subject.”

Charles Walbridge is teaching
tenth and twelfth grade classes in
Biology at Shikellamy High School
and, for him, “teaching is a de-

ings to “Private Eye,” Box W-157.

manding job, and requires a lot of
preparation.” He also cited the im-
portance of a good critic-teacher-
student-teacher relationship for a
rewarding student teaching experi-
ence.

The problem of adjusting to a
completely new type of schedule
was often alluled to. Kris Redmond,
teaching first grade at Millward
Elementary School, said that
“standing all day was tiring at
first.”

Joan Gerrity is teaching second
grade at Southward School. Al-
though she is enjoying teaching,
she is also looking forward to “‘gett-
ing back to classes second semes-
ter. I miss being able to read a lot,
miss seeing the kids.”

Jane Cole, a first grade student-
teacher at Mifflinburg, also expres-
sed a feeling of being “really re-
moved from the campus, and obliv-
ious to things like mid-terms.”

Jane added that it is “difficult
to be a student-teacher among es-
tablished teachers. You feel very
much a ‘student’ teacher.” Most re-
ported good relations with the
teachers, and avoidance of contro-
versial topics. As Hartman said,
“Pm there to learn how to teach
kids.”

It might seem that discipline
would pose a problem. (The stu-
dent-teacher is not the authorative
figure that the teacher is.) But
very few mentionel disciplinary
problems of any great importance.

Walbridge cited ‘the usual ones
trying to bandy words with you.”

He counters occasional flying ob-
jects by calmly confiscating the
missile, and proceeding as if noth-
ing unusual had happened. Hartman
said that there are “good days and
bad days, but usually I can keep
the kids under control.’ None of
those teaching on the elementary
level cited disciplinary problems as
such.

A greater stumbling block, more
so in the lower grades than the
high schools, is the wide range of
abilities each class absorbs. ‘With
as many as 82 in a class,” Mary
Ellen said, “you can’t give each
kid the time you’d like to give
them.” Jane noted that at times
“you run into things in stories
that the kids haven’t heard of,
things like ‘running water’ and
‘baker.’ Some aren’t ‘middle-class’
kids, and sometims you forget 5 had

Despite the adjustment, the extra
work load, and the minor, unfore-
seen difficulties that arise, the stu-
dent-teachers (at least those inter-
viewed) compose a happy group of
seniors. As Jane summed it up,
“Tt’s nice to see an application of
what you've learnel.”

Though all Trivial readers prob-
ably know that the Jack of Hearts
and the Jack of Spades are one-

eyed jacks, how many of you know
that in every deck of cards:

All the jacks have blond hair,
and the Jack of Spades alone has
ringlets.

The King of Diamonds holds a
battle-ax, and the other three hold
swords. (The King of Hearts holds
his sword behind his head.)

The King of Hearts, the Jack of
Diamonds, and the Jack of Clubs
do not have moustaches.

And each of the queens holds a
flower in her hand.

This is the way itis.

Focus: The Draft

y DAN MARTIN

Features Editor’s Note: The following article is the second in a
series digested from the BUCKNELL ENGINEER, March, 1970,
Vol. 21, Number 3. It is based on an article in that publication by
Joseph W. Rogers, assistant professor of electrical engineering,
entitled “A Short Look at the Selective Service.” This series is
meant to illuminate its readers on the Military Selective Service
Act and the draft.

There exists in the present Selective Service Act a student
classification other than that of II-S.

Regulation 1622.15 states that in the class of L-S ‘‘shall be placed
any registrant who while satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course
of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution of learn-
ing and during his academic year at such institution is ordered to
report for induction . . .”’ This deferment is the only one that is
available once an induction order has been assured, and permits
a student to complete an academic year if he has held a ILS de
ferment, and lost it because he reached the age of twenty-four or
ran into academic difficulties.

One may consider some regulations related to the student de-
ferments: Regulation 1641.7 requires that it is the duty of every
classified registrant to keep his local board currently informed of
his occupational, marital, dependency, and military status, his
physical condition, home address, and receipt of certain profes-
sional degrees within ten days of change in such, in writing. One is,
in effect, required to inform the local board that one may be
eligible for a lower classification even though it is not desired.

Another regulation, 1622.1, points out that each registrant will
be considered as available for military duty until his eligibility
for deferment or exemption from military service is clearly es-
tablished, to the satisfaction of the local board.

If one desires a deferment, then, this regulation says that the
burden of the proof lies on the registrant to prove to the local draft
board that he is eligible for a classification other than I-A. Then
the board is charged with putting him into the lowest classification
for which he is eligible (see chart in last week’s Bucknellian).

The Numbers Game

On another line, the lottery system may, to many be a confus-
ing and unclear operation and this view seems quite understandable
considering that many provisions of it are open to interpretation.

When a call is received from the State Director of Selective
Service for a specified number of men to be delivered for induc-
tion, the local board selects and issues orders enough for the num-
ber of men required to fill the call. These men are selected from
among the registrants who have been classified in Class I-A or
Class I-A-O, and to whom a Statement of Acceptibility (DD Form
62) has been mailed at least twenty-one days before the date fixed
for induction.

When a registrant refuses, or fails to comply with, an order of
his local board to report for an armed forces physical examination,
he may however, be ordered to report for induction even though the
Statement of Acceptibility has not been mailed to him.

Registrants are selected and ordered to report for induction in
the following categories, and in the order indicated:

1. Volunteers who have not attained the age of 26 years.
Nonvolunteers in the Extended Priority Selection Group
(definition follows)

Nonvolunteers in the First Priority Selection Group (defini-
tion follows).

Nonvolunteers in each of the lower priority selection groups.
Nonvolunteers who have attained the age of nineteen years
during the calendar year but who have not attained the age
of twenty years, with the oldest being selected first.
Nonvolunteers who have attained the age of twenty-six

ALLELE IES OIE PTE ED

By DAVE COULTER

This season has seemingly been
just a collection of bad breaks for
the Bison soccer team, and last
week’s game against Delaware was
no exception.

In it standout fullback Larry
Greenwood was sent to join the
rest of BU’s ‘walking wounded’ with
a third quarter ankle injury. In
spite of this injury, Larry wants to
pe on the field Saturday, as the
Bisons conclude their season
against Lehigh.

This illustrates well the reason
why he has been such an asset to
the defense this year.

Larry’s soccer days began in his
junior year in high school, with the
fullback position, where he has
played almost exclusively ever
since.

He initially was seeking just to
keep in shape, but was taken in by
the spirit, the team, and the game
itself; and he has been working
hard at it ever since.

This year’s young defensive squad
is beginning to look real ‘‘tough”
to Larry. He believes, ‘“‘We have to
make the effort to work together
and hustle, hustle is everything on
defense.”

Larry expects this
p erience to pay off next year and
he forsees “a lot of competition
for the positions.”

The lack of scoring this year ap-
pears to the Blue fullback to be a
result of the many injuries on the
line and the problem of not being
able to get the shots. -

“The last game is really impor-
tant,” he suggests, “for our at-
titude and the way we respect our- |
selves.” Larry feels the team has
great potential next year if they

work together, for they have the
ability if they want to play - it’s
all attitude.”

You have to be aggressive and
keep after the ball, you can’t wait
for the ball or you'll lose it.

The fullback praises Coach Rey-
nolds for “working the team hard,
so they learn to push in practice,”
and for his “respect for the play-
ers.”

The fans, and the interest in soc-
cer at BU mean a lot to him. The
fact that “someone is concerned
with how you do - the feeling of
playing for someone else besides
yourself - is important” to his at-
titude and spirit.

Larry believes that the Bisons
have a powerful home advantage
in the fan support which has been
given to the team.

Larry has great respect for ath-
letics and keeping physically fit,
but he is also involved in finding
himself and his place in life. He
is searching hard “‘to perceive him-
self in a valid manner.”

He enjoys associating with people
and traveling, and has worked with
underprivileged children at a
camp during the summer, teach-
ing them among other things the
game of soccer.

All Bison fans wish Larry the
best of luck in finding his way off
the injured list and in preparing
for next season, as well as in ful-
filling his desire to retain his con-
nection with soccer after his grad-
uation.

Then There Were Two

ge Bisonettes Send Players

To Mid-Eastern Tourney

By LIZA EDGELL

Last weekend the field hockey
team traveled to Gettysburg for the
Susquehanna Field Hocney Associa-
tion Tournament. The tournament
is unlike a regular season game.

This year eight teams were rep-
resented, including Susquehanna,
Gettysburg, Wilson College, Penn
State, and Centre County Club.

However, the players were watch-
ed for individual selection to one of
two teams which will represent
SFHA at the Mid-East competition
in Rochester, New York this week-
end.

Only two of the Bisonettes are go-
ing to the Mid-Easts. Ronnie Hilles
was selected as the right halfback

on Susquehanna II. This was Ron-
nie’s last SFHA tournament, and
she was “very happy’’ when she
was selected. Ronnie scored the
first goal of her career in the Mes-
siah game, so her selection was the
“perfect end” to a good season.

Marge Deck is also going to the
Mid-Easts. She was selected as
honorable mention at the SFHA
tournament. She may play at Ro-
chester if another player is unable
to compete.

Honorable mention players were
selected because they were “‘out-
standing throughout the tourna-
ment,” said Lois Bowers as she
announced the teams. Selection was
not the only honor that Marge re-
ceived.

She was also elected as the sec-
retary of the SFHA.

Although two members of the
team were selected for the Mid-
East, the general feeling of the
team was that more members could
have been selected if they had
played up to potential.

On the first day of the tourna-
ment, the team ‘just didn’t care
enough.” The team’s spirit seemed
to flag after the game with Ship-
pensburg in which two players were
injured.

Sue Gant caught a drive in the
back of her hand, and Karen Shar-
man was hit in the thumb. Monday
it was discovered that Karen’s
thumb was fractured.

On Sunday, the Bisonettes “just
didn’t look like the same team’’
that played on Saturday. hey had
the high score of the day, beating
Centre County Club 3-0.

Pitchmen Face Engineers

The Elizabethtown Blue Jays
knocked off the Bison booters 2-0
last Tuesday. The Blue and Orange
played a tough game but their of-
fensive drought continued.

The offense has managed only
two goals in the past five games.

However Coach Craig Reynolds
feels that his team could have
“easily ended up with a 0-0 tie.
Their first score was a result of
a lack of communication while their
second was on a penalty kick.”

Elizabethtown scored first early
in the first quarter. Goalie Lloyd
Ryysylsainen charged a long kick
just as one of his fullbacks went to
clear it and the ball slipped past for
the goal

The Bison defense was then su-
perb throughout the rest of the
game as fullbacks Mike Novak, Bob
Gibson, and Bob Reed kept the
Jay’s offense from closing in on
Ryysylainen and forced the outside
shot

Coach Reynolds felt that his of-
fensive line had several good
chances to score in the second
period but his starters tried to pass

off too often. As a result the Jays
outshot the Bisons by a 22 to 1
margin throughout the game.

In the third period freshman cen-
ter fullback Mike Novak pulled a
magnificient play. Recovering nicely
on a drive by an Elizabethtown line-
man he tackled the ball. However
the referee didn’t see it that way
and awarded a penalty kick to the
Jays which resulted in their second
score.

A big blow to the Bison’s chances
against Lehigh is the loss of Rich
Collins. The varsity inside right is
the fourth lineman the Blue and
Orange have lost all year.

This Saturday marks the final
game for seniors Glenn Mars, Bob
Reed and Lloyd Ryysylanien. Fan
support has really helped to psyche
this year’s squad and Coach Rey-
nolds hopes it will continue against
Lehigh.

The Big Blue booters will have to
kick hard if they hope to clinch a
second place in the MAC. Lehigh
has won their last five in a row
with nine starters from last year’s
fine squad the Bisons will have a
tough battle.

BU Gridders Meet Lehigh
With Burke Hopeful at QB

By ALAN GROCHAL

“Lehigh has the best balanced
backfield of any team we’ve played
this year.’ This was Coach Fred
Prender’s apprasial of the Bisons’
opponent in Saturday’s game.

The Engineers are a strong run-
ning team and utilize a full back-
field of three runners and a quarter-
back.

Leading rusher for Lehigh is full-
back Jack Rizzo, an MAC sprint
champ. Rizzo has picked up 650
yards on 140 carries.

He is complemented by halfback
Don Diorio, who has gained 460
yards.

Engineer quarterback Gerry
Berger is small at 5‘6” and 160
pounds, but he is a skillful ball
handler and runner. Berger was
particularly damaging against the
Thundering Herd last year.

He was a split end up until three
games ago when the starting sig-
nal caller, Ron Wilske was hurt.
Since Berger has filled in, Lehigh
has won two of three games, in-

cluding an impressive 36-13 victory
over Delaware last Saturday.

Overall, the Engineers are 4-4 and
in games with previous Bison op-
ponents are 2-1. Lehigh scored a
7-0 victory over Rutgers and a 34-
18 win over Gettysburg, but lost to
Colgate 21-12.

The Engineers’ leading receiver is
tight end Dave Gill with 11 catches,
who is also an outstanding blocker.

Coach Prender said he plans no
defensive changes to counteract the
awesome Lehigh running game.

“We'll have a couple of new sets,
but we will use basically the same
defense as we have so far. Our
type of defense against the run has
been fairly successful.”

He called last week’s Colgate
game ‘‘just a question of a better
team, although not 30 points bet-
ter.”

In the injury department, center
John Klenovic, quarterback Howie
Burke, and guard Tom Connolly are
all “hopeful’’ of seeing action Satur-
day.

Harriers Thump E. Stroudsburg

By RICHARD VROON

The B.U. Cross Country team leg-
ged out another victory Wednesday,
defeating East Stroudsburg by a
score of 21-38. The Herd managed
this despite the hindering affect of
two team members being sick.

The East Stroudsburg course was
very hilly, and it probably measur-
ed a quarter mile or so longer than
the rated five miles. Because of
those factors and the rainy weather,
everyone was clocked at times a
bit slower than in other meets.
BU’s Tom Lucas won first place
with a time of 29:34.5. In second

place was East Stroudsburg’s Lew
Gunderman, timed at 29:57. BU
managed to capture the next three
places with the afforts of Tom
Hagerty (30:15), Scott Bartram
(30:24), and John Larner (30:29).
East Stroudsburg took sixth and
seventh pdaces, followed by Bisons
Tom Gardner, Rich Francel, Ken
Hydock, and Dave Gilroy. Three of
the remaining ten places were oc-
cupied by the Herd, the last four
of these going to East Stroudsburg.

The victory gave the cross coun-
try team a 9-1 record for their reg-
ular season. The team is preparing

Baby Bisons End Grid Season
By Lancing Susquehanna, 38-6

By JEFF QUINZER

In their final game of the season,
the Baby Bisons exploded for 25
points in the first half and coasted
to a 38-6 victory over the Crusaders
of Susquehanna. Night football
seemed to agree with the Bisons,
both offensively and defensively,
as they rolled up their highest point
total besides intercepting 5 passes
and recovering a fumble.

Carl Probst and Paul Perlick led
the scoring outburst as Carl ran
for two touchdowns and passed for
a third while Paul scored twice and
kicked two extra points.

The defensive heroes were numer-
cus, as Bernie Spirk, Rich Ko-
lodgie, Dell Duncan, Paul Kmetz,
and Bob Brunnet all picked-off Cru-
sader aerials. Guy Messick re-
covered a fumble which later led
to a score

The Bisons wasted no time gett-
ing on the scoreboard, as Probst
combined with flanker Bill Stein
for a 30 yard scoring pass after

3%4 minutes of play. On Susquehan-
na’s next series of downs, a bad
snap on fourth down gave the Blues
the ball on the 17-yard line.

Two plays later, Steve Renock
carried the ball in from 8 yards out.
before the half was over, QB Probst
had scored twice on runs of 3 and4
yards and Paul Perlick had added
a conversion.

In the second half, Perlick tal-
lied on runs of 3 and 11 yards and
kicked another extra point. The
Crusaders, trailing by a large mar-
gin, were forced to go to the air
and it was then the defense inter-
cepted 5 times.

Susquehanna’s lone score came on
a 90-yard kick-off return by speedy
Darrel Willis.

With this final win, the team
finished its season with a 4-3 mark
and Coach William Lane had these
closing comments about the team
he had worked with all year. ‘We
had a respectable season as for as
the record goes,” said the coach,

HAIR
44 NORTH

“and I think we were beaten by
some fairly good teams.”

Coach Lane praised the defensive
unit and the squad in general. ‘‘The
team improved a great deal over
the course of the season. They
never gave up despite the score.
The only possible criticism I might
have would be the inconsistency in
the offense. The defense was ex-
cellent all year. They just got better
and better with each game. In-
dividually, I would say that
Quarterback Carl Probst helped us
a great deal. We had trouble mov-
ing the ball at first but he helped
things tremendously.”

What about the future of this
team? The coach feels that “quite
a few players should move up to
the varsity next year, perhaps 25-
30. The boys are winners, they
have a winning attitude. The last
two years I’ve had fine squads;
they have to help the football pro-
gram here. We had a lot of fun
too, and that’s part of it all.”

New Dorm Initiates
No Hours Proposal

By BILL WHITNEY

The New Dorm Council is pres-
ently drafting a proposal to the ad-
ministration recommending 24 hour
open dorms, it was reported at a
Council meeting last night.

The proposal basically would
eliminate all limits on visitation and
would grant dorm autonomy to the
individual residence hall in determ-
ining what hours, if any, they de-
sire.

In addition, the proposal would
be applicable to the upperclass res-
idence hall and houses, and the fra-
ternity houses. Freshman halls, how-
ever, are not included in the docu-
ment.

The rationale behind the proposal
lies in the fact that part of a col-
lege education is learning to live
with others in everyday situations
and learning to accept one’s re-
sponsibilities.

As Gary Koutnik, member of the
committee drafting the proposal
phrased it, college is “not just an
academic education, but is an ed-
ucation in real living.”

The feeling of the committee was
that the required segregation of one
sex from the other for a portion of
each day is a situation not existing
in society as a whole. The proposal
is being drafted because college
students have “the right to the re-
sponsibility of mature adults,” said

New Dorm President Gary Raynar.

A major factor in favor of the
Fwoposal is the outcome of a poll
taken of New, Hunt, and Swartz
Hall residents, which revealed that

90% of the students favor at least
22 hour open dorms.
New Dorm Council will present

their proposal to Director of Resi-
dence Halls Judith Judy and Dean

Kunstler Appears in Gym
After IM Swim Tourney

By ERIC RIESS

Attorney William M. Kunstler will
speak in Davis Gym tomorrow night
at 8:30 p.m.

This announcement came from
Russ Pais, sophomore class presi-
dent, after a week of negotiations,
between Pais, director of athletics,
Robert A. Latour, and provost,
Wendell Smith.

The intramural swimming meet
which is also scheduled for to-
morrow night will begin at 7:00
p.m. in an effort to insure its’ con-
clusion before Kunstler’s address
at 8:30.

In a letter to The Bucknellian
Smith stated that the misunder-
standing that developed when Pais
attempted to reserve the gym for
the speech is based in large part
on “‘the difficulty of scheduling ma-
jor campus events at short notice,
a misunderstanding of priorities. . .
possible inseneitivity to issues on
both sides of the matter, and the in-
evitable misinformation and rumor
which is generated when several

people work very intensively for
more than a week on something as
complex as the problems were in
this case.”
ine

For the complete text of the Pro-
vost’s letter see page 2.

FE ee

As a result of this instance Smith
went on to say that, “Immediate
consideration must be given to an
improvement in procedures for
scheduling events on short notice.”

Kunstler, described by the Wall
Street Journal (November 28, 1969)
as “the foremost legal defender of
civil rights workers and New Left
radicals,” is known primarily for
his defense of the ‘Chicago 7’ in
their conspiracy trial resulting from
the riots during the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago in
1968.

Currently Kunstler is defending
the faculty and students indicted
recently by an Ohio grand Jury in
connection with the deaths on the

Hamilton Rejects ‘Mutually Dishonest’
Attempts at Meaningful Black Studies

By PETER BALAKIAN

Dr. Charles Hamilton, professor
of Urban Studies at Columbia Uni-
versity, addressed the students and
faculty Sunday night in a speech
concerning the present Black Stu-
dent movement in America

Dr. Hamilton dwelt on the topic
of the Black student’s relationship
to the traditional structures of
American universities by explaining
that the present American univer-
sities are geared to carry out the
society’s traditions, and among
these traditions are racism.

Therefore, the Blacks, in demand-
ing Black studies programs may be
asking the universities to do some-
thing that they are intrinsically in-
capable of doing. If this is the
case, honesty is the only answer
for the present time. If the uni-
versity cannot supply the Blacks
with the program that they so de-
sire, then the university must be
honest and tell them so. Also the
Blacks must be honest with them-

N.Y. Times — National Association for Minority Education
(NAME) has announced a plan to ask the 50 largest corporations
to donate funds toward the wider education of lower income whites
and minority students. They are asking each corporation to
assess 1% of its annual profits for colleges enrolling minorities.
NAME plans to make a list of approximately 500 schools to which
the money should go. Small private institutions will head the list.

Dickinson College is planning a Public Affairs Symposium for

« 1971 which will consider the “Invasion of Privacy in a Computer-
ized Society.” Speakers invited include Former Attorney General

selves, and if their demands can-
not be met, they should either leave
the institution or accept what it
can offer. Hamilton emphasized
this fact by saying: “I take Black
Education too seriously to work
with a perpetual show of mutual
dishonesty.”

Hamilton spoke also of the great
progress that the Blacks have
made in the past decade in rela-
tionship to higher education. Black
enrollment, he said, rose 85% from
1964-1969. The total Black enroll-
ment today in American colleges
and universities is 434,000 and most

of these are in White colleges. Ham-
ilton emphasized the fact that the
history of the Black Movement
must be understood in order to
comprehend what is happening to-

Bookstore

By SUSAN PRESTON

Warren G. Elze, director of the
University Bookstore, stated this
week that ‘More students have been
caught shoplifting this fall than
ever before.”

In an article to The Bucknellian
last spring Elze said that stealing
was a minor problem with less than
one percent of the stock stolen each
year. The amount of stock stolen
this fall has already surpassed this
mark and the situation is becoming
serious.

The action to be taken regarding

shoplifters will depend on the cir-
cumstances of the case.

“Several
students have been put on probation
this semester and one has with-
drawn. We are also considering tak-
ing criminal action in some cases,”
said Elze.

To cope with this problem the
bookstore has increased its number
of employees to facilitate surveill-
ance of shoppers.

According to Elze, ‘Shoplifting is

New Draft Choices
‘Conflict’ with Laws

News Analysis
By JOE ROGERS

The New York Times reported
on October 27, “Dr. Curtis W. Tarr,
the director of Selective Service,
ordered local draft boards today
to withdraw deferments immediate-
ly from those men who request
that their deferments be can-
celled.”

The article also referred to the
announcement that men with num-
bers greater than 195 will not be
inducted this year

Such an “order” is in direct con-
flict with the regulations (32 CFR
1600) which govern the Selective

were hoping to find a way to lower
prices. But we anticipate a rise in
prices to cover the expense of shop-

its present rate.

A variety of reasons have been

given as to why a student shop-

the student to justify his stealing.

Dorm Autonomy

The University will have before it a proposal that
will permit each living unit to determine its own visita-
tion hours and lock-up procedures. We demand that im-
mediate action be taken to enact these recommenda-
tions, pending final approval of this matter at the De-
cember meeting of the Board of Trustees.

The impetus for the proposal derived from the re-
sponse to a questionnaire circulated to the residents of
New Dorm in which ninety per cent of the students
living in New Dorm stated that they want each hall
of the dormitory to have self-determination with re-
gards to visitation hours.

Affirmative action on the part of the University
need not be delayed. All students must be permitted the
right to dorm autonomy, now.

FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK

Details, Details

By PAUL OSHER

Robert Latour’s response to The Bucknellian front-page edi-
torial November 13, 1970 summarizes the events of the last two
weeks, which led to our request for his censure. Unfortunatly, he
leaves out several important details.

1) Since the present University regulations on scheduling facil-
ities cites him as the administrator of the gym, he is indeed obli-
gated to know the exact dates and times for which the Gym is re-
served. He very casually admits his delinquency in his duties.

2) He infers that he was out of contact with class representa-
tives from November 3 to November 11. This was not the case.
Several class representatives were in contact with basketball coach
Don Smith all that week, trying to satisfy his conditions that bas-
ketball practice be re-scheduled without undue hardship to the
coach or the players. If there were any changes in the status of
the Gym for the night in qugestion, Latour, well aware of the efforts
being made to meet the needs of the basketball team, should have
had no difficulty in informing the class reps of the new develop-
ments.

3) The alleged confusion that Latour refers to in his statement
concerning the presence of Jack Schmidt and Pete Doscher in the
matter is contested by the two students. They claim that Mr.
Latour was well aware of their role, and that he had outlined to
them on November 6 the conditions under which the Gym could
be made available. No mention was made of the intramural swim
meet.

Bob Latour combined a lack of communication between himself
and his staff and an insensitivity to a large segment of the Univer-
sity community desiring access to a national figure like William
Kunstler which resulted in his flat-out rejection of the use of the
Gym that evening. Had he truly been “concerned about what
happens te and at Bucknell” he might have endeavored to arrange
the compromise which was finally agreed upon.

Latour’s public statement over the radio waves of WUDO dur-
ing the half-time activities of last Saturday’s football game should
be closely scrutinized by the members of the University commun-
ity. It suggests a cord of distrust between Latour and the Univer-
ity administration—an unfortunate state of affairs.

Abortions

The Abortion Referral Service that has been advertised in our

$25 commission on each referral. They refer only to the East Side
Medical Group in New York City. They have no counseling service
or follow-up program to help after the abortion. The East Side
Medical Group charges a flat rate higher than the clinics and
services that the Bucknell Birth Control Information Service recom-
mends. They offer no financial assistance to those who cannot af-
ford an abortion.

FEEDBACK: Latour

Censured ? ? ?
To the Editor:

Censured???

Due to the recent attack by the
Bucknellian editorial staff upon my
character voicing the opinion that
I should be censured by the entire
University, I feel that a reply is
certainly in order.

For what am I being censured?
‘ For not knowing the exact
dates that have been previously es-
tablished on the intramural sched-
ule for swimming?. . - For failing
to express this properly to Russel
Pais, President of the Sophomore
Class?

The Bucknellian unfornuately
again presents a one-sided view of
the incident.

On the evening of Thursday, Oc-
tober 15, 1970, in the classroom of
Davis Gymnasium, a meeting was
held for all intramural representa-
tives. At that meeting it was an-
nounced that the Men’s Intramural
Swimming Meet would be held on
November 17 and 18, 1970. I was
not aware of these dates although
I knew that plans were underway
for our first intramural champion-
ships in swimming.

Between the time that I was ap-
proached by Russ Pais (November
3rd) and my second visit by him
(November 1ith,), after switching
the basketball practice schedule to
meet his request, I learned that
the Intramural Swimming Champ-
ionships had been scheduled for
the same date that the sophomore
class had been requesting. I in-
formed him that I could not sign
the release for the building as the
intramural date had been set weeks
in advance and as Davis Gymnas-
ium houses the Department of
Physical Education, Intramurals
and Intercollegiate Athletics, I felt
that their October 15th scheduling
of the date had priority.

Eric Reiss reported that 1 did
not care whether William Kunstler
spoke at Bucknell University or
not. This is not completely ac-
curate. Suffice it to say that I
am very concerned about what hap-
pens to and at Bucknell Univer-
sity.

Apparently some students felt
that I had the knowledge of the
intramural date “up my sleeve” to
counter their request. This is not
true. I repeat, 1 knew nothing of
the intramural swimming dates un-
til after my initial contact with Mr
Pais. I do feel, however, that the
presence of Jack Schmidt (a junior)
and Peter Doscher (a senior) add-
ed some confusion to the situation
representing the sophomore class.
T actually wasn’t sure who I was
dealing with at some stages during
that week.

I feel very sincerely that I have
not been at fault, The Bucknilian
censure editorial in which it was
stated, “it seems that he has made
every effort to thwart . . .” ete.
js slanderous and immature. One
should not be censured on what

“seems to be”. They have found-
ed their judgment upon half truths.

I restate that I am constantly be-

£9 tT RAD AEST ELA ET

ing approached by various individ-
uals and groups (often with very
little advance notice) to cancel
the activities of our department in
order to meet their requests and,
yes, even demands.

I feel that I have been extremely
cooperative throughout the years
and have changed our program nu-
merous times to meet these re-
quests for the building. A sugges-
tion of censureship by The Buck-
nellian is an extremely unfair and
one-sided view of this entire inci-
dent

Robert A. Latour
Director of Athletics

Lacks Evidence
To the Editor:

The request for censure of Robert
Latour must have been based on
evidence which was not presented
in in the report of The Bucknellian
of November 13, 1970.

After investigation, it is my view
that it is based in large part on (a)
the difficulty of scheduling major
campus events on short notice, (b)
misunderstanding of priorities in
scheduling, (c) possible “‘insensi-
tivity” to issues on both sides of the
matter, and (d) the inevitable mis-
information and rumor which is
generated when several people
work very intensively for more than
a week on something as complex as
the problems in this instance.

There are several points to be
made if the events associated with
the difficulty in scheduling the visit
of Mr. Kunstler are to be evaluated
fairly. First, the gymnasium is not
a public hall. It was designed and
intended to be a facility for athletics
and, as such, it must be under the

e
control of the athletic department.
Second, scheduling of major cam-
pus events, those sponsored for the
whole Bucknell community, normal-
ly is done no later than the second
week of a semester so that conflicts
with athletic or other events can be
resolved far in advance.

Third, contrary to what is stated
in Mr. Riess’s article, Mr. Kun-
stler was not scheduled at any point
to speak in the gymnasium during
the week in question, a point of
misinformation. Fourth, the men’s
and, probably women’s intramural
swim meets which are scheduled
for Wednesday, the 18th, were
scheduled on October 15; hence, the
date and time of the swimmeets
cannot be constructed as an effort
to block the use of the gymnasium
for a speaker, as was implied.
Fifth, attempts to schedule major
campus events after a semester
has started invite conflict and pres-
sure when a specialized facility
such as the gymnasium or the the-
atre is involved.

The rescheduling of events al-
most always infringes on the rights
of those who wish to participate in
those events. Rescheduling two
swim meets and basketball prac-
tice on Wednesday without in-
fringement required time. Still, a
system which produces no answer
in ten days to as simple a ques-
tion as, “Can space X be used for
purpose Y at a specific time and
day?” surely contributes uninten-
tionally to a climate of doubt and
suspicion.

Immediate consideration must be
given to an improvement in pro-
cedures for scheduling of events on

An Ark
To the Editor:

I believe the time has come for
the University to consider adding a
new Item to its budget. I realize
that this will bring groans from
anyone who has anything to do with
finances at this University but I
also feel that this is a necessary
move. I might add that the time is
fast arriving when it will be too
late to act.

I hereby propose, in view of pre-
sent and past meteorological con-
ditions, that the University put
aside funds for the building of, and
begin construction of, an ARK to
save us all.

I also propose that the dimens-
ions of this Ark be at least three-
hundred cubits by seventy cubits by
seventy cubits. It should be con-
structed so as to be able to con-
tain and maintain the entire uni-
versity community along with two
examples of each living species
(male and female, of course), from
the highest order all the way down
to Agnew.

I do hope the University will see

en neariataid

the urgency of this proposal and act

on it as soon as possible.
Respectfully Yours,
Bruce Campbell

Defective Degrees
To the Editor:

The group of students who wrote
a recent Bucknellian editorial are
to be congratulated. The result was
no more than two or three times as
confused as the usual Bucknellian
editorial, no mean feat when five
people collaborate. And it had the
additional virtue of being signed.

However, if they must reason by
analogy, it would make betwer
sense to cast the Bucknell adminis-
tration int the role of the General
Motors management, the faculty as
the United Auto Workers, and the
students and their families as the
hapless consumers.

We should then strengthen the
analogy by recalling 60% - 70% of
the degrees we have been granting
on the grounds that they are ob-
viously and dangerously defective.

It is hoped that Dean Dunlop will
approve the proposal and place it
before the University Board of Trus-
tees at the semi-annual meeting on
December 5 for their action. How-
ever, the Council realizes that Dean
Dunlop might raise certain objec-
tions to the proposal.

As the Council understands it,
Dean Dunlop feels that such a pro-
posal should be postponed until after
June, 1971. At that date the evalua-
tion of the present one-year exper-
iment in co-educational residence
halls (which Dunlop supported) will
be submitted.

After the results of the co-ed
dorm experiment are evaluated,
Dunlop feels, the next step would
then be a proposal for 24 hour open
dorms. Any premature attempt
might injure future chances for
such a proposal.

However, the New Dorm Council
still hopes to convince Dean Dun-
lop and President Watts as to the
validity of their case. The Council
will continue working through the
administration to have their pro-
posal placed before the Trustees.

It is quite possible that a Jocal

The registrant is then in the

Consequently he may be issued an

Booters Prevail
By DAN MILLER

The booters wrapped up their 1970
campaign by defeating Lehigh 2-1,
clinching a second place finish in
the MAC

In a game that developed into a
muddy battle, the Herd started
slowly, slippi and sliding in the

mud, they showed little desire to
go to the ball and less will to:move
aggressively on offense.

The Engineers tallied during. the
early going, on a corner kick that
was perfectly placed over the
crease, goalie Lloyd Ryysylanien
missed when he tried to punch the
ball out of danger, and Lehigh’s
Tom Klonick drilled the rebound
into the net

BU slowly began to jell at this
point, penetrating further into Le-
high territory and working the ball
better until the second quarter.

While trying to clear the ball, Le-
high goalie took too many steps in
the penalty area, The resulting di-
rect kick was bounced around in
front of the goal until Jim Daven-
port popped it into the net.

This knotted the half-time score
at one goal apiece.

The third quarter evolved into an
ordeal for both the pl and the

sizable crowd. The rain and blustry
wind didn’t help the miserable
field conditions, and the spectators
that endured the weather were
presented with a dramatic effort
by the Herd.

Larry Greenwood, who was on

crutches as late as Wednesday,
played with only brief respites.
Greenwood repeatedly picked him-
self up after spills as though he
might never walk again, but still
played air-tight defense.

Steve Sparkes, who seems to

have developed the sliding tackle

into an art kept thwarting Lehigh’s
offensive thrusts.

And all the while Ryysylainen
protected the net, charging out like
a spider in a web to clear the ball.

Then in the fourth quarter, a Le-
high back was caught handling the
ball in the penalty area.

Glenn Mars finished off his var-
sity career by drilling home the
penalty kick, making the score at
full-time 2-1 BU.

This was the final game of the
1970 season and leaves the team’s
record at 6-3-2. Glenn Mars, Lloyd
Ryysylainen and Bobby Reed play-
ed in their last match for the Herd.

One tradition that ended with this
game was the eight year journey of
Mr. and Mrs. Mars. and Mr. and
Mrs. Reed. Their two sons have
been on the same team since high
school and the two couples have
been to every game they have play-
ed home and away.

Glenn Mars played his last game for the Bison booters Saturday. The
senior captain used his talented toe to drill in the winning goal against

Lehigh.

The Bisons ov ame an early 10-
0 deficit and scored a big 24-20 vic-
tory over Lehigh

In a game marked by balanced
offenses and outstanding defensive
pl the Bisons came from be-
hind twice to down one of their
toughest opponents.

Last week, the Engineers had de-
feated powerful Delaware, the Big
Blues’ opponent for next week.

After the Engineers had built a
10-0 first quarter lead, the Bisons
rallied for 17 points in the second
period to hold a 17-10 halftime ad-
vantage.

Dave Boyer started the rally with
a 20-yard field goal. Then the of-
fense, under the direction of Howie
Burke, marched for two touchdowns
on drives of 86 and 72 yards. Both
drives culminated with Mitchell
Farbstein scoring on runs of 5 and
2 yards.

The Lehigh, with a field goal in
the third quarter and quarterback
Jerry Berger’s scoring pass early
in the final period, regained the
lead at 20-17.

The Bisons bounced back and
moved 70 yards in 18 plays. Farb-
stein registered his final score of

the afternoon when he tallied from
5 yards out.

After Boyer added his third extra
point, the final score read 24-20.

The game wasn’t over yet how-
ever, and Lehigh threatened to re-
gain the lead. Only fine defensive
plays by the Bison secondary stop-
ped the Engineer rally.

Gene Luccarelli broke up what
appeared to be a sure touchdown
pass and John Ondrasik made a

fine open field tackle on a crucial |

fourth down play to halt the drive.

Offensively, quarterback Howie
Burke kept many drives alive with

his passing. He completed 17 of 26 |

passes for a total of 163 yards.
Eleven of these were to his favorite
receiver of the game, Paul Gile-
wicz. Paul had a fine afternoon

with a total of 106 yards for his re-
ceptions.

Commented a pleased Coach
Prender, “‘It’s really too difficult
to say any one group (offensive or
defensive) played the major role
in this game. This just has to be
the biggest team victory of the
season. The defense was just out-
standing when it had to be.”

“Offensively, we made some
changes last week in our attack and
we moved the ball very well. The
line did a great job blocking and
the backs were outstanding. Diez,
Farbstein, Giacomelli, and Wright
all did fine jobs. I was particularly
pleased with the sophomore backs

Rich Diez, Farbstein and Greg
Wright). Our offense was very well
balanced.”

Did the team make any adjust-
ments to deal with Engineer quar-
terback Jerry Berger, who runs

“No we didn,’t replied the coach,

VOLUME LXXII— NO. 21

By JUNE CAFFREY

The University community will
welcome “The Band” in concert
November 22.

As critic Ralph Gleason said
about one of their San Francisco
performances:

“they found it in themeselves to
express a part of where all of us
are at now, while expressing
where they are at themselves in
language and metaphor that can
ignite explosive trains of thought
inside your head.”

“The Band” became popular with
its first album, ‘‘Music From Big
which Time hailed as “‘an
event.”’ Life described it as ‘‘buck-
etsfull of clear, cool country soul
that washes the ears with a sound
never heard before.”

Many feel that this album had a
great influence on the direction of
rock music.

Once known as the group who
backed Bob Dylan, ‘The Band” is,

Andy Meyer announced that as
usual no blankets or pillows will be
allowed in the gym and also no
cameras or tape recorders will be
allowed in. Meyer also said that
the concert committee will not be
responsible for anyone who cannot
be admitted because of this re-
striction. As usual there will be
absolutely no smoking in the gym.

great influence on each other.” As
he puts it, ‘““Dylan brought us into
a whole new thing and I guess he
got something from us.”

“The Band is not concerned with
how their music will be labeled.
They feel the most important thing
is the personal satisfaction they
derive from their music — “‘so we
can smile at one another when
we're through playing.”

They seem to have smiled a lot
as they played to sell-out houses
throughout the United States and
Canada, among them the Garden
State Arts Center in New Jersey
and the Fillmore Auditoriums, both
East and West.

Cunningham Replaces Kunstler

Highlights ‘Band’ bien Speaker Accents Freedom

TOM NOVINGER

falco William Kunstler who
was scheduled to speak in Davis
Gym Wednesday, November 18, was
unable to came because of an un-
expected evidenciary hearing called
concerning the Chicago 7 con-
spiracy trial. In his place his law
partner, William Cunningham,
spoke about the recent Kent State
indictments, the Flower City, Con-
spiracy, and other draft file de-
struction trials.

Cunningham is a Jesuit priest and
a professor of low at Layola Uni-
versity in Washington, D.C.

Also a practicing lawyer, Cun-
ningham has been active in the de-

fense of various groups such as the

“Chicago 15” and the ‘“Catnos-
ville 9.’’ accused of the destruction
of draft files

He is presently filing suit against
the Federal Government on behalf
of Fathers Daniel and Phillip Ber-
rigan and 21,000 men in federal
prison confinement on denial of con-
stitutional rights. Father Phillip
Berrigan was held in the Lewisburg
Federal Penitentary for a_ short
period recently.

Cunningham emphasized that the
spirit with which he was going to
speak was free expression. He con-
tinually referred to the First Amend-
ment which guarantees freedom of

Commerford Releases Pledge Statistics,
Discusses Revision of Fraternity Status

By GINA SMITH

Fraternity rush this fall has re-
sulted in the pledging of approxi-
mately 248 freshman men, accord-
ing to Gerald Commerford, Assist-
ant Dean of Men for Fraternity Af-
fairs.

This figure is not definite. Com-
merford estimates that the total
may increase to 265 as other frosh
pledge; next semester de-pledgings
may reduce the number.

Dean Commerford calculates that
70% of freshman men attended at
least one rush function and that be-
tween 48 and 49% actually pledged.

‘The Band’ will

- i, play “clear, cool

soul” to

Sunday at 8:15 p.
m. in Davis gym.
They will be the
last ABS concert
this semester.
Tickets for this
concert and the
“Chicago” concert
in February may
be purchased at

the Bookstore.

Sets Total at 36

Both figures represent a slight in-
crease over last year

Approximately the same number
of freshmen gone Greek’’ for
the last five rs. Five years ago
a 2.0 scholastic average was re-
quired

Although fewer men were eligible
then, a higher percentage of them
pledged. There no longer are any
scholastic requirements for fresh-
man rush

Dean Commerford notes changes
in this year’s rush procedure. For
the first time, fraternity houses
were opened from 10:00 a.m. to
midnight, Monday thru Thursday,
during the last week of September
and the second week of October.

“This provided a more realistic
picture of each house for the fresh-
men,” he states. ‘‘Although this
worked very well for the frosh
naturally, it was hard on the fra-
ternities.”

Another seeming change here is
the fraternities’ tendency to ac-
cept ‘‘all types’? of men. In the
past most houses were known by a
stereotyped image. Although this
has persisted in a few houses, fra-
ternity membership no longer im-
plies loss of individuality.

Dean Commerford describes the
rush program as a “‘closed system.”
“Unlike some other schools, the
first emphasis is on academics.
This is why freshman residence
halls are forbidden to fraternity
men during rush,”’ he explains.

He views fraternity status as part
of a “new look’’ in schools of the
East and West. ‘“‘The Midwest and
South are characterized as ‘fratern-
ity country’. Rejecting this image
and strong affiliation with a na-
tional fraternity, eastern and west-

ABS Increases Membership on Senate

After playing the “numbers
game,”’ with the Senate member-
ship the ABS passed an amendment
13-6 this week, which increases the
Senate membership to 18 faculty,
11 students and 7 administrators.

The original suggestion came
trom Bob Wendel, who said, ‘‘The
original number of 30 members is
not enough. In order to have a
viable community, we have to re-
present more of the community.
The Senate body is a body of 30
and the faculty is a body of 200,
which does not seem right.”

Wendel suggested that ten be
added to the faculty, ten to the
student, and three to the adminis-
trative representations. Total would
be 25 faculty, 18 students, and ten
administrative officials.

Bob- Nachshin ABS _ treasurer

thought, “The composition of the
Senate is pretty ambiguous. With
the role the faculty assigns us, I
find it insulting to have less than
one-third representation. In the
April document, we had 29 percent
representation, here we have 27
percent. I question why students
have such little representation on
the Senate.’’

In retort to Wendel, Jack Hart
thought, “‘The more people you get,
the more people you have who will
not be doing their homework. You
have to be practical about what is
a good working number.

However, Nachshin said, ‘The
number of students is feasible, if
students have strong involvement
in the academic affairs, but the fac-
ulty does have better expertise on
academic affairs.”

As discussion continued, Dean
Dunlop made mention of the fact
that discussion was becoming a
numbers game. “We're trying to
make a decision-making body. Is
that more important than having
more people? We may very well
have difficulties in finding ten more
qualified people. For that reason,
I feel 30 members is a workable
body.”

In further discussion, Nachshin
said, “The substance of the docu-
ment is more important than the
numbers. The question is whether
the faculty will buy that. The stu-
dents as a whole should have the
decision to choose.’”

Before Dean Dunlop’s amendment
for 18-11-7 representation passed,
Pais said, ‘“‘Why start to compro-

ern schools’ fraternities tend to
desire local autonomy within the
national hierarchy.”

He admitted that, in past years,
de-pledging has been a major prob-
lem here. He atributes this to
freshmen asking ‘‘why.’’ One re-
sult of this ‘“‘healthy questioning”
has been the alteration of some na-
tional and house policies.

For example, many houses are
modifying the traditional ‘‘super-
ior-inferior” relationship between
upperclass members and freshman
pledges. ‘‘I would prefer to think

ABS Debates Recommendation
For Endowment Scholarships

By JENNY CHEN

Reccomendation for student-sup-
ported scholarships was introduced
at this week’s ABS meeting. The
vote on the measure will be delayed
until after Thanksgiving vacation

“T was impressed by actions taken
on loan funds and student-sponsored
scholarships by other schools when
I went to a conference in Washing-
ton this summer,’’ explained Dave
Lacy ABS president. ‘‘There is a
greater need for the University to
offer financial aid, especially from
the viewpoint of attracting minority
groups.”

After Lacy conferred with John
Hayward, Director of Financial Aid,
John Dunlop, Dean of Student Af-
fairs and John Zeller, Vice Presi-
dent of Business and Finance this
week, several suggestions were
made on how to handle scholar-
ships based on allotments from stu-
dents’ general fees.

Lacy suggested an arbitrary
amount of five dollars to be added
to the general fee in an attempt to
explain the different proposals.

One way is to collect the $12,000
for student-supported scholarships
each year which would be given
directly to the students in need.

The money could also be given to
the University in the form of an
endowment or a gift, with interest
being taken on the total.

The third proposal, one which
Lacy endorses, is to take the five
dollars and split it up. Arbitrarily,
$10,000 could go into an endowment
fund with interest accumulating, or
as a gift. The $2,700 could be an
immediate scholarship. ‘‘This last is
a compromise, we can either loan
the money for investment or give
the money,” said Lacy.

Presently, the former SFC has
allotted $31,000 in endowment funds
which could be retracted. This
amount would then be added to the
$12,000 for scholarships.

Dean Dunlop said, “If a commit-

tment is made would be long
range. You would be accumulating
funds fas ou would be
with a class gift. This is more in

GUEST COLUMN
| Ivan Denisovich
By ROBERT E. BEARD

Two half-pints of oatmeal for lunch and dinner, 10 oz. of bread in-
stead of 6 for dinner, a piece of roofing felt tacked over his barracks
window, a taste of sausage from a friend who received a “package,” and
a piece of metal which can be ground into a knife found and slipped past
the guards.

Ivan Denisocich Shukov puts his legs into the sleeves of his jacket,
pulls his overcoat over his blanket and settles down in his sawdust mat-
tress at the end of a good day in his life and at the end of a good first
novel by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

Shukov is in the 8th year of his undeserved 10-year imprisonment in
a Siberian labor camp. His enemies are very ancient Russian ones: cold,
hunger and human brutality, not Soviet society.

The fences are boundary marke barely symbolic. Prisoners who
disobey have their food rations cut or their coats revoked.

The suffering which Shukov and his comrades undergo in no way €x-
plicates the profound universal questions raised by Dostoevskian suffer-
ing, but pointlessly and fruitlesly reduces the prisoners to the most prim-
itiev elements of their being.

This primitiveness does not print through Solzhenitsyn’s characters
in the purely negative terms of avoiding cold, hunger, and brutality, how-
ever.

These men by and large large retain and, moreover, strive to express
a fundamental dignity which they brought with them from their villages.
“To be good at something” is of utmost importance to them.

Shukov is a mason who takes deep pride in laying each brick per-
fectly. He also takes pride in his survival. It becomes an intellectual
game: getting the second bowl of oatmeal, sneaking the piece of metal
through the shake-down, putting up the roofing felt and then talking down
the gang hen he orders it removed. It is the test of how much
dignity remains and to what extent it can be expressed that measures
the life within them and throughout the day Shukov administers these
tests to himself—just to make sure.

He and his are building one of those miraculous cities that spring
up out of nowhere in Siberia. This is a book about nowhere—a lost world
in the 40’s and 50’s of up to 16,000,000 victims of Stalin’s paranoia. Since
the death of Stalin, those innocently imprisioned have been released. In
1967 alone, upward of 4 million were restored to society.

The language of the book is as stark and barren, as bereft of lyricism
and imagination as the world it describes. You would expect the story to
pass through your brain like a strand of barbed wire, but it doesn’t. In
this reviewer’s opinion, Solzhenitsyn is less adept at inciting the emo-
tional understanding of a situation than Hemingway, Chekov, or Salinger.
It has neutrality of a news report. The achievement of the book lies else-
where.

Not since Radishchev’s Journey from St. Petersburg (1790) has there
been such an outspoken monumest to one man’s courage in Russian
literature and it has probably served even to a greater degree to en-
courage other intellectuals to speak out for more civil liberties. Only
after the publication of this book did Sakharov, Daniel, Sinyavsky, Alma-
dryk and Grigoriev dare to raise their voices above the underground.
None of these men are anti-socialist; all would curtail the use of terror
and introduce intellectual rights (freedom of speech and press) commen-
surate with the social rights achieved already for the proletariat (em-
ployment, recreation, education, medicine, woman’s equality and re-
tirement)

It is Solzhenitsyn’s outspoken life as a whole that raises again the
question of the place of courage in a society. The cantankerous insis-
tence of the Soviet dissidents on maintaining certain civil liberties not
afforded by the Soviet government place their courage on the same level
as that of John, Robert and now Ted Kennedy, Martin King, Angela Davis,
Rap Brown, Timothy Leary, Ralph Nader. Ironically, the Soviet dissi-
dents of the past decade have the better survival record.

Apparently, our only difference of opinion a propos incarceration for
political beliefs results from our democratic tradition: we feel it is per-
missable as long as a majority agree to it. An ironic twist of this ex-
temely important difference between the leader of the “free’’ world vs.
the leader of the “‘slave’’ world it that if we believe our recent elections,
we may well have come to the point where an ever-growing majority in
this country favor political repression while the minority in the Soviet
Union continues to dwindle.

Note also that while the war-time stream of defectors from Eastern
Europe has become a bare trickle, the number of American “emigres”’
increases year by year. Hundreds to Sweden, thousands to Canada, more
than 20°000 to Austrailia alone in recent years.

One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich was the beginning of a begin-
ning of the open criticism of the last great fault in Soviet society. It and
the events, following it, to culminate in the decision of whether Solzhen-
itsyn goes to Sweden to pick up his prize, are as important for what they
tell us about ourselves as they are for what they tell Soviets about them-
selves.

Letters to the Editor

The Draft
To the Editor:

I would like to make two com-
ments relevant to Dan Martin’s
column, “Focus: The Draft’’ (which
appeared in The Bucknellian Nov.
6, 1970).

1. The description of I-S should
read “Student deferred by statute.”
Perhaps “‘status” is more appropri-
ate but it is not the word used in
the regulation.

2. That one may re-apply for a
IL-S deferment after an extended
illness is actually an opinion of a
selective service spokesman. I be-
lieve it will prevail.

Sincerely,
Joe Rogers
P.S.

I think that Dan Martin has done
a good job in condensing about
three pages into a single column
directly relevant to your readers.

Recommendation

To the Editor:

I strongly recommend “The Ath-
lete as an Artist’? in the November

terested in athletics.

There appears to be no end to the
insults to the intelligence of this
community by the base characters
permitted to come to Bucknell as
guest speakers. As if it were not
degrading enough to have Rennie
Davis within the past year, further
insult is added to injury by the
proposed coming of William Kunst-
ler. Again I ask, ‘“‘What benefit can
be gained by calling in such a per-
verted and demon possessed crea-
tures?”

Again, I also ask, why are there
not men brought to this Campus
who would advocate decency, pa-
triotism, and christianity. Would it
not be far better to bring a man of
the caliber of Jonathan Edwards,
Who was a true intellectual) but
was used vitally by the spirit of
God to cause spiritual enlighten-
ment in this country in his day. His
message was extremely beneficial
to the young nation, nor did he ad-
vocate anarchy and the demoraliza-
tion of society.

Please think upon these things.

Very truly yours,
Malcolm A. Clinger

Flower City
To the Editor:

The first week of the Flower City
Conspiracy Trial is over. Eight
people face a possible sentence of
38 years a piece for their individual
parts in action taken against the
FBI office, the Federal attorney’s
and the state draft board in the
Federal Building in Rochester, N.Y.

If we call these people radical we
must also understand that they are
very sensitive, moralistic and re-
ligious people. Almost half of the
people in attendence were clergy
including 2 protestant and 1 catholic
bishops. The depth of the defend-
ants’ moral convictions is witnessed
by the one question the defendants
put to prospective jurors. “Do you
believe in the bible passage ‘thou

but as the time of

becomes a trifle nearer

it soon becomes apparent that

shall not kill’?”

Politics can not be excluded from
the ideology of the defendants, on
the contrary their actions were po-
litical in two senses. First they
struck out at a machine grinding
away with top efficiency at human
life. Second, the methods they chose
were their own design and not the
systematic outlines and diagrams
of the present government.

In Rochester today the defend-

moral significance of the deaths at
Jackson State and Kent State.

Joni Nickelson, one of the defend-
ants summed up the objective of
the 8 Flower City Conspirators when
during the first day of court session
she raised the following objection
to prosecution evidence, “I don’t
see where pictures of windows and
doors have anything to do with
human lives with which we must
be concerned.”

ants are trying the United States
for it’s murder of millions in Viet-
nam, Cambodia and Laos. Their
actions at the Federal Building and
in court are bringing to light the

Footnotes

By PAUL J. J. PAYACK

Will the Phoenix Arise?

Footnotes as a column is concerned with communication; in this case
the written word or as McLuhan would have it, linear or sequential
thought.

We products of the media are all too aware of his message: that the
medium has more impact than the substance of what is said, shown or
written. It has been estimated that the youth of America accumulate some
14,000 hours absorbing the trash radiated by the tube; some 3,000 more
hours than they spend in school.

Considering the levelling influences which permeate the airwaves
one can understand why McLuhan has said, ‘‘We are fools to use radio
and television in the modern world. Only madmen would use radio and
television if they knew the consequences.”

Is the present state of communications as bleak as this metaphysician
of the media would have it? Suffice it to say along side others knowledge-
able in the field he comes across as an optimist. The consensus seems to
agree on the point that certain technological advances represent the
quantum leaps which lead to major destructuring of existing societies.

Philosopher Alfred North Whitehead precisely summarizes this po-
sition, “The greatest advances in civilization all beut wrecked the societies
from which they emerged.”

One must admit that our civilization appears to be rapidly approach-
ing the all-but-wrecked stage. Is there nothing more to do but await the
new phoenix to arise from the ashes?

One man who believes he has a clear and distant view of, if not the
answer to, the problem is Isaac Asimov, the scientific fictionist. Mr. Asi-
mov postulates that the root-problem stems from the fact that a civiliza-
tion can only rise to as complex a level as the communications medium
available permits. Once this level is reached the civilation will either
stagnate or decline until a new communications breakthrough ensues.

‘Asimov assumes that three such breakthroughs hav occurred. Obvious-
ly the first catalyst was the first spoken word. Through speech traditions
could be spread across generations, and the discoveries stumbled upon ac-
cumulated. However, with this medium man could not progress much
further than hunting and collecting. The second advance was frozen speech,
whiting. =

A society with only the complexity of the Roman confederation could
be supported with writing. (In fact at one point McLuhan hangs the fall
of Rome upon the loss of the Egyptian papyrus crop and therefore its
source of writing material). The third leap came with the invention of
movable type; The mechanical reproduction of the written word. And this,
with minor alterations, is where we now stand.

Where we now stand? What has McLuhan to worry about if we’re still
dominated by the written word and sequential thinking? Asimov’s answer
is that the problem is not inherent to the media, but rather in Mankind’s
incomplete use or misuse of their electronic potential. Civilization has
become so complex, he reasons, that information must be distributed in
enormous quantities to enable the individual to cope with it. His hope
centers around the creation of electronic literacy where every man would
own his own electrical outlet as today each man can own his own library.

Imagine the possibilities. All the world’s knowledge, all known data
would be available to everyone at the turn of a dial or press of a button.
Information would be relayed from huge central storage centers and dis-
tributed the world-over through communication satellites.

And so mankind once again converges on Armageddon. Some social
commentators, like Robert Ardrey, think it already too late. He sees an-
nhilation as mankind’s only out, “.. . if we annhilate ourselves, we can
escape.”’ Begin the whole experiment over again, this time learning from
our mistakes.

On the other hand Mr. Asimov gives us a fighting chance, with the
fourth revolution in communication our only weapon. “The race is on,
and by 2000 at latest it will be decided: either the world of the fourth
revolution will be in full swing or it will not be. In the latter event, the
world of the third revolution (and all mankind with it, probably) will be
in its death throes.”

The Society of Black Composers

By TOM FICKLINgsnnenne

As part of ahe first Afro-American Symposium, The Society of Black
Composers performed in concert, Friday, November 13, 1970 at 8:30 p.m.
Coleman Theatre.

The Society of Black Composers was founded in 1968, to provide a
permanent forum for the works and thoughts of black composers, to collect
and disseminate information about black composers and their activities,
and to enrich the cultudal life of the community at large.

With Hubert Laws on flute, Ron Carter, double bass, Warren Smith,
percussion, Hank Johnson, piano, William Fischer, soprano saxophone (ania
a Bucknellian for one year), Clifford Bowens piano, it should be empha-
sived that as black creative artists, their intent was not to entertain. Their
performance was a brilliant testament to the black motive force and
should be understood in this context.

“Black Creative Artists and the Aesthetics of a Philosophy”
by

Stephen Chambers, President of the Society of Black Composers

As mankind is the highest and final culmination of the thoughts of
Divine-Intelligence, his (our) primary function on this planet earth is
and should be the constant striving for a complete and total re-union with
such an Intelligence.

That being-the-case, let it be fully understood that all art is and should
be religious and ritualistic, functioning as an effective instrument through

The action can be called political

life be placed first and foremose on
any political agenda.

The Flower City 8 acted out of
conscience and moral conviction
and will be punished politically for
it. If these people must answer for
their actions taken under moral
pretense then why not Richard Nix-
on for the tragedy in Vietnam or
the CIA for the murders in Latin
America. If a man can no longer
respond to his conscience and his
moral and religious beliefs, then
George Orwell’s 1984 is here.

Dorm Autonomy
To the Editor:

After reading the editorial of The
Bucknellian (November 17) on
‘Dorm Autonomy” I find myself in
a quandary over the point of the
editorial. As a member of the com-
mittee working on the proposal for
self determination of parietal hours
I am pleased to see support for the
proposal. However the obvious
thoughtlessness of the editorial can
only be detrimental to achieving
implementation of the proposal.

This thoughtlessness is manifest
in the fact that you ignore Bill
Whitney’s article in the same paper
and what it states as the basis for
the proposal and what it will deal
with.

It was all upperclass dorms and
not just New Dorm that was polled

and all will be considered in the |

proposal. Furthermore the objective
of this proposal is to present an

in your room and read The Buck-

nellian than you have to read long
articles on bulletin boards, let me
attempt to explain to you what the
article was really about.

Kunstler was merely speaking on
the topic of legal aspects of self
defense. He mentioned the well-
known fact that the government and
especially the police are not always
especially careful to safeguard the
Constitutional rights of all the citi-
zens; government and police do not
necessairly exist for the good of
all. This cannot be disputed; blacks
have suffered from this repression
legally from 1619 until 1863, and il-
legally from then until today, from
just those quarters.

Others of us are now beginning
to see this hatred for what we
stand for and what we are turn in-
to overt and covert acts of repres-
sion by the systems of government
and the power structure. The entire
speech centered around this point:
The power structure is not there to
serve and protect you, in fact, you
are its enemy and it will do all it
can to keep you from exercising
your rights, so you must protect
your rights and your lives yourself.

The phantom thumbtacker ne-
glected to highlight the part of the
speech in which Kunstler explains
just why John Gleason was stomped
to death. He had just gone into one
of the ghetto wards, far from his

own precinct, under no orders to do
so, and shot an unarmed black man
named Bobby Lee Williams. It was
during his attempted “retreat” that
he was killed.

Two of the crowd were convicted
of his murder, and Williams, be-
cause he refused to testify in that
trial, was ‘indicted for an attempt
to murder John Gleason, although
it’s hard to realize how you can at-
tempt to murder somebody when
you’re lying on the ground with a
38 caliber bullet in your gut, which
is exactly what the position of
Bobby Lee Williams was.”

Kunstler in not defending lynch-
ing, for God’s sake. The overall
message is summed up in this
quote: “If the power structure
knows that you are determined to
use that piece if your community
is invaded, if people you love or
respect, or who are merely your
sisters and brothers, are being vic-
timized and destroyed by police,
you have the right to use whatever
forces necessary to prevent that
depradation of human rights.”

Lynching is not an act of self
defense. Kunstler is speaking out
against lynching; he is telling the
blacks that the police lynching of
people like Bobby Lee Williams and
students at Jackson State and Kent
State will continue unless the re-
pressed people of this country are

which the message of Truth-Wisdom of this Divinity is channeled.

As one of many, many forms through which (God) has chosen to
manifest His being, Black-people must acknowledge their (our) particular
role according to the Master-Plan.

Furthermore, since the concepts of (God) and “spiritualism” have
been forgotten, distorted, and corrupted within the narrow confines of
“materialism” that now serve as the working precept for this country,
““white’-americans are desprately groping for a spiritual re-birth and re-
newal of which Black americans in their (our) Devine role as “seers”
Black people are all of the Piscean order), can and must be at the
vanguard !

It is incumbent, therefore, upon Black - Creative Artists working
through whatever medium to commence a “Priestly” duty of re-ordering
and re-creating a National-Culture that will sustain and perpetuate the
Life and Vitality of an emerging people. For “‘to create is to change; that
is, you cannot create without first changing that which already exists,
especially if the essence of that which exist is polluted with moral/spiritual
decadence.”

In demanding the emergence of the spiritual essence within a people,
Black-Creative Artists must of themselves be spiritual for no man can
begin the involvement of any meaningful revolutionary process, “ex-
teriorly,” if he has not first gone through the revolutionary process, “in-
teranlly,” of looking at WHO he is and examining himself with new
feelings and new ideas! !

The primary responsibility, therefore, of Black-Creative Artists with-
in a total-revolution is not only the utilisation of their art-forms as in-
struments of communication in raising the social-political awareness and
consciousness of the people but also in rejuvinating and revitalising the
inner essence of thei (our) Spirituality.

Thus, Black-Creative Artists must, out of necessity and duty become
“functional” entities of the Divine-Mind (God) and perpetuate the aes-
thetics of a functional-philosophy of the Black-Arts’’ for the Cultural/Spirit-
ual Liberation of not only Black people, but of all people who are cul-
turally/politically/spiritually enslaved within the “shell that is our body-
being.” Hence, if such a task is blocked by fears, prejudices, and doubts,
then we ALL face permanent enslavement and will have no other alterna-
tive but to further descend into the dregs of moral/spiritual decadence.

campus a reprint of an article |

which appeared in The Black Pan-

The article is the text of an ad- |
dress given by Attorney William |

Kunstler to the UFAF (whatever

that is). Out of the approximately |

1900 word article, five sentences
are highlighted in yellow on all the

copies I have seen, and written |
above the title are the words, “If |
you like lynching you'll love Kun-

stler.””

The five sentences contain the |

description of how a Plainfield,
N.J. policeman was “stomped to

death” in the black getto of that |

city, and also contains the words

(Kunstler’s), “In my opinion, he |
deserved that death. . . The crowd,

justifiably, without the necessity of

a trial and in the most dramatic |
way possible, stomped him to

death.”

Outside of the outright lying, tak- |

THE BUCKNELLIAN
NOV. 20. 1970 PAGE THREE

General Electric pioneered the
development of nuclear power plants

in 1957.

Right from the beginning, we felt
that the greatest advantage of nuclear
power was environmental. Unlike
fossil-fueled power plants, nuclear
plants don’t burn anything to make
electricity. And where there’s no fire,

there’s no smoke.

But there’s a possible
disadvantage as well. It, too, is
environmental. Thermal effects.

We recognize it.

One GE advertisement you may
have seen recently pointed out that
“all nuclear power plants discharge
heat, as do fossil-fueled plants.
America’s utilities, with many years
of experience, are working on
thermal problems at nuclear sites on

a plant-by-plant basis.”

General Electric does talk about
thermal effects. Because they are
important, but also because we feel
the facts about them are perhaps too

little known.

Few people realize, for example,
that federal law requires utilities to

operate their plants within strict
temperature limits. Thirty states have
even stricter laws. Utilities are
spending millions of dollars on
dilution flow systems, cooling ponds
and cooling towers to comply.

But, in addition, utilities are
sponsoring basic research on the
problem of heat exchange and its
effect on aquatic life. More than 97
utilities have been financially
involved in over 300 such studies.
And each one adds a little to man’s
scientific understanding of the

Some interesting things have
already come of it. For one, it’s been
found that, in some cases, adding
heat to water can actually be
beneficial. Warm irrigation water has
extended growing seasons. Warm
water has created new wintering
ponds along waterfowl migration

Power-plant discharge water is
reviving Long Island’s oyster trade.
Florida is using it to grow shrimp and
lobster. In Texas, it’s increasing the
weight of commercial catfish by as

thermal pollution when they
talk about nuclear

individually, in its own environment,
and this is being done.

General Electric, the electric
utilities and environmentalists will
continue to work. Work hard.
Because we think the advantages
of nuclear power far outweigh the
disadvantages

Why are we running this ad?

We're running this ad, and
others like it, to tell you the things
General Electric is doing to solve
the problems of man and his
environment today.

The problems concern us
because they concern you. We’rea
business and you are potential
customers and employees.

But there’s another, more
important reason. These problems
will affect the future of this country
and this planet. We have a stake in
that future. As businessmen. And,
simply, as people.

Another amendment did pass
unanimously. Students eligible for
Senate membership are all those en-
rolled in fulltime regular academic
programs of the University. The
requirement of a 2.3 GPA was
lowered to 2.0 on the basis that a
student with a 2.0 is still in good
standing.

Another motion brought on the
floor was to maintain a quorum
consisting of half the Senate, 50

percent of the faculty, 30 of the
students and 30 of the administra-
tion present.

Bob Wendel, who suggested the
idea, felt that the “fractioning out
of the quorum into percentage is
important if there ever arose a sit-
uation where Senate could not be
partially represented. This does not
hinder the Senate because an abso-
lute minimum of attendance on
each group makes provisions for
the whole group.”

However, a similar motion made
by Jeff Sengstack, for a quorum of
two-thirds, 50 percent éach, was de-
feated 14-5-2, after Wendel withdrew
his motion.

not sit by and watch any more of
our brothers get killed and wounded
and then indicted. If our govern-
ment will not defend our constitu-
tional rights, then we will have to.”
Because, you see, when the govern-
ment ignores your rights, there is
none to turn to but yourself.

Kunstler is not blasting all forms
of government in this country; he
isn’t calling every policeman a pig.
He is merely saying that in most
cities a black man cannot feel safe
from his own police force, or per-
haps from only part of his own
police force

Kingman Brewster, president of
Yale, has said, a black man can-
not get a fair trial in America to-
day. William Kunstler is saying
that this is true in enough cases so
that preparation for self-defense is
justified.

The frustation felt by blacks try-
ing to live relevantly in white
Amearic is something that very few
whites can understand.

Dean Commerford is encouraging
more involvement between fratern-
ities and the Lewisburg community.
He cites the fraternities’ many un-
publicized efforts in local affairs.
“Although there are no ghettoes
and major problems in Lewisburg,
it is still possible for fraternities to
increase their civic activities,’ he
asserted. 6

As Assistant Dean of Men for
Fraternity Affairs, _Commerford
provides overall assistance for the
Inter-Fraternity Council, aids in
problem solving and _ individual
counseling, and acts as liason be-
tween the fraternities and Dean of
Student Affairs.

Enthusiastic about the University,
he considers himself fortunate to
work with people here. ‘“The fra-
ternity situation is a healthy phe-
nomen, part of the campus com-
munity. I see no barriers, anly fa-
cades, between fraternity members
and independents. As was proved
by the May strike this year, we all
can work together.’

By DEAN LANDEW

“When blacks demand rele-
vance,’ they speak from a certain
point of legitimacy. The first prin-
ciple . . . emphasizes individual ad-
vancement and says, ‘We are color
blind.’ The second principle empha-
sizes the group and must be con-
cerned with racial questions.”

The notion that society is operat-
ing under two different principles
of legitimacy was stated by Dr.
Charles Hamilton, Columbia Uni-
versity Professor of Urban Studies,
in an address Sunday night as part
of last weekend’s Afro-American
Symposium.

Two juniors, one white and one
black, discussed separately with
the Bucknellian their personal views
on the Symposium and the many
ramifications of the Black situation
here on campus, using the two prin-
ciples of legitimacy as a basis for
comment.

Kay Smith is a member of the
subcommittee on Afro-American
Studies, and is white. She attended
Friday’s concert, Saturday’s drama,
informal discussion with Dr. Hamil-
ton and part of his speech Sunday.
In an overview comment, Kay said,
“Throughout the whole weekend
there was an illustration of the
second point of legitimacy.”

She continued, ‘The Symposium
was specifically set up to empha-
size Black thought, not just Ameri-
can thought. I feel it was success-
ful for those who attended. It illus-
trated certain specific aspects of
Black polit and culture in that
it gave us a greater perspective on
Black life.”

Kay explained that one of the ma-
jor motivations for creating the sub-
committee came in response to
black students’ requests. She feels
that the committee is working real-
istically, although now, “It is not
working fast enough for some ele-
ments on campus.’’ She does feel,
however, “It’s a step in the right
direction.”

Looking beyond the Symposium,
she said, ‘I question whether this
University has the resources to de-
velop a large scale Black Studies
program. I would like to see a few
more courses instituted. Hopefully,
the drive for a black professor will
be successful,” She continued, ‘But
to bring one black here is almost
tokenism.”’

“Idealy, I would like to see a few
blacks on the faculty with different
Black experiences,” Kay said. She
also explained that any black pro-
fessor who came here would have to
be someone who has lived with and
been educated with blacks.

In this respect, Kay feels that the
university is headed toward the
second principle of legitimacy, but
in a slightly qualified way. “It
couldn’t just be ‘We need a black
professor.’ I would put qualifica-
tions on ‘black;’ not necessarily a
PhD, but minimum academic cre-
dentials.””

On the possibility of a Black
Studies program, she said, ‘‘Ob-
viously, without outside help, whites
cannot put together a Black Studies

program. Also, any Black Studies
program cannot be just for black
students.’’ She explained, ‘‘Econom-
ically, it isn’t justifiable.”’

As her personal attitudes on the
Black situation today, Kay com-
mented, “Although we should all
have equal rights, blacks and
whites have individual needs and
wants.” Mentioning that she taught
in a predominately black school in
Mississippi last summer, Kay now
feels that blacks have “more a
sense of community. This came
back to me more Saturday night
sitting in the audience.”

Pe ae

Speaking from the Black point of
view, Carlton Mitchell saw the Sym-
posium somewhat differently. He
attended the concert, the drama and
Hamilton’s formal speech Sunday.

“The Symposium was poorly at-
tended,” he said. ‘As for what
it was trying to accomplish, it was
trying to bring an awareness to
this campus about the black people
and their spirit. How successful
that was, I don’t know. There must
be an appreciation of the Black ex-
perience by white students. I don’t
think there has been for a long
time.”

Carlton further explained, “The

music Friday night was good, but
I don’t think a lot of students here
enjoyed it and understood it.
They’ve been underexposed to that
kind of music.” Carlton feels that
the drama and dance troupe was
“excellent,” and that Hamilton was
“superb.”

As for Hamilton’s presentation of
two principles of legitimacy,’’ Carl-
ton said, ‘‘We aren’t even as ad-
vanced as the first principle yet.
Either principle would be adequate
for a start. Since we got into do-
ing something, we could decide
which principle is best for us. We
haven’t had the opportunity to de-
cide yet.”

He continued, “The black stu-
dents here are small in number and
not well organized yet. The Uni-
versity is a microcosm not of total
society in that a special type of
student goes here. I guess that says
something about the admissions de-
partment.

“There is not too much hope for
a change here. We, as students,
must realize that, right now, all the
power is in the hands of the trus-
tees. We are being ruled by those
who give money to us (referring
to the alumni). So we must behave
conservatively. The University must

be very cautions.”

Asked how change could be ef-
fected, Carlton answered that there
must be a “raising of the level of
consciousness among administra-
tors, faculty and especially stu-
dents. We must stand up to the
powers that be. Students will defi-
nitely have to play a major role.”

He continued, “We're going to
have to become more than stu-
dents. Students are manufactured
They come out in boxes looking all
alike.”

Carlton also feels ‘‘a lot of stu-
dents don’t know why they're here.”
He explained that many will “do
anything to avoid the draft,’ and
“a real education means more than
just studying.”

Carlton commented on the role
of the faculty in effecting changes
on campus, such as a Black Studies
program. “The faculty hasn’t the
backbone to go out and do some
things themselves. Their jobs prob-
ably would be in jeopardy, but it
takes guts to do something like
that.” He sees a “minimal amount
of black professors and courses” in
the future

As for the Symposium itself, Car]-
ton said, ‘‘A lot of black students
were here from other schools and

that was a good experience. Some
of them didn’t even know this Uni-
versity existed.”

Carlton did say that the subcom-
mittee made ‘‘an honest effort to
make a step in the right direction,
and many of their efforts will be
substantial. The Committee has
lined up some good people, I’m told,
but I don’t think it will go farther
than that. I’m very pessimistic.”’

Series Evaluates Ratios;
Depicts Faculty Staffing

By JACKIE STUBBA

This article represents the last
of the series of interviews with
department chairmen on the prob-
lem of employing the needed staff
members to correspond with large
enrollment in the courses. Although
it was not possible to interview all
of them, the departments that were
covered give a general insight into
the situation at this university.

Professor David S. Ray, chair-
man of the department of mathe-
matics, counted the total enrollment
to be 1086 students. Each of the
sixteen faculty members teaches
three classes, creating an approxi-
mate student-faculty ratio of 30:1
for freshmen, 20:1 at the sophomore
level, and 10:1 for upperclassmen

Inside the actual classroom, the
ratio averages about 21:1, although,
in some eases, it is higher. Ray
Stated that, ‘The large ratio we

have is less than ideal, but it cer-
tainly is a workable one.”

The department is understaffed,
he feels, but satisfactory arrange-
ments (made possible by financial
aid from the National Science Foun-
dation) will permit the hiring of
another lecturer next semester for
two courses.

The math department made no
request to enlarge the staff this
year, Ray explained, “Due to a
larger number of majors, this de-
partment has increased by 3 or 4
in the past five years.’”’ He does not
believe the staff to be badly over-
worked; however, one potential
problem might be Math 191 (other
departments are considering mak-
ing that a possible requirement) if
this happens, the number of stu-
dents in that course could double
or triple. However, the present sit-
uation he feels to be satisfactory.

Professor Harold W. Heine, chair-
man of the department of chemis-
try, cited the ratio of students to
faculty to be 90:1 this semester.
Due to a large increase in enroll-
ment in the introductory courses,
more lab stations will cause an
“untenable situation,” as Heine dis-
criber it

Four upperclass courses have had
to be dropped, including one im-
portant course for students going
on to graduate work in that area.
And a new laboratory course de-
signed to partially compensate for
some of these losses will not be in-
stituted

This year, due to a change in
curriculum for engineering students,
liberal arts majors could not fit
into the Chemistry 111-112 classes;
thus, two new courses must be
created for them. “This is at the
expense of courses for our majors,”
Heine commented.

Although these conditions are
rough on the staff members, Pro-
fessor Heine acknowledged that
“mutual cordiality and respect be-
tween the department and the ad-
ministration.”

The chemistry staff has taken on
extra burdens willingly enough but,
now, ‘‘additional staffing is absolute-
ly necessary.”” For, under the pre-
sent conditions, “‘The chemistry de-
partment will be in critical condi-
tion for the academic year 1971-72.”

Focus: The Draft

By DAN MARTIN

Features Editor’s Note: The following is the last in a series
digested from the BUCKNELL ENGINEER, March, 1970, Volume
21, Number 3. It is based on an article in the publication by Joseph
W. Rogers, assistant professor of electrical engineering, entitled
“A Short Look at the Selective Service.” This series is meant to
enlighten its readers on the Military Selective Service Act and the
draft and, this week, methods of appeal are examined by Robert
Dan Martin.

* *

The Military Selective Service Act provides some methods of
appeal.

For example, Regulation 1624.1 (a) states that every regis-
trant whose classification has been determined by the local board
has an opportunity to appear before members of the local board
designated for the purpose of appealing. Such a registrant need only
to file a written request within 30 days after the local board has
mailed him a Notice of Classification (SSS Form 110).

Another regulation, however, restricts this right of appeal by
establishing that ‘‘no person other than a registrant shall have the
right to appear in person before the local board, but the local board
may, at its discretion, permit any person to appear before it with
or on behalf of a registrant.” Certainly, to appear before a mem-
ber (or members of the board is a provision of the regulations and
not a privilege granted by an altrustic board, The fact that the
members receive no monetary compensation for their appeal-work
may make hesitancy slightly understandable.

One technical result of requesting a personal appearance is
that it holds off any inluction order which might otherwise be re-
ceived.

Three Possible Courses

If a personal appearance is not successful, three possible
courses of action are open. One may do nothing, and accept the
classification with which one is not satisfied; one may appeal to the
appeal board; or one may uncover certain information which. will
enable the board to grant reclassification

Regulation 1625.2 indicates that the local board may consider
anew the classification of a registrant (a) upon the written request
of the registrant, the government appeal agent, any dependent of
the registrant, or any person who has, on file, a written. request
for the registrant’s current deferment in a case involving occupa-
tional deferment (if such a request is accompanied by newly found
facts that would affect the registrant's classification); or (b) upon
its own motion for similar reasons.

The local board is directed not to reopen a registrant’s class-
ification once an induction order is mailed, unless his status has
been affected by something over which he has no control.

If the board does reopen the classification, it must consider
the new information and all the relevant information which was
presented previously. In this case, its actions would be the same
as if it were determining classification for the first time.

Exen if the local board denies a registrant the classification
for which he feels he is eligible, he may still appeal to the state
appeal board. Such an appeal should be sent to the registrant’s
local board, which must forward it to the appropriate appeal board.

The appeal stays an induction order in the same way that the
personal appearance does, and the decision of the appeal board
is final, except when an appeal to the Presidential Appeal Board
is granted.

If the appeal board’s decision is unanimous, the case is closed,
except for some action that might be taken by the State or National
Director of Selective Service.

If one or more members of the appeal board dissent, the
people listed above in Regulation 1625.2 may appeal to the Presi-
dent in the same manner as they appealed to the appeal board.

The appeals outlined above are the legitimate rights or a reg-
istrant, provided he satisfies the conditions. Although he may have
absolutely no grounds for requesting a lower classification, he may
still exercise his right and may stave off an induction order as
long as six months, in which time his status may change and he
may become eligible for a lower classification.

If a registrant’s classification has been determined to be LA
and he feels that he is eligible for a lower classification, he may
obtain a complete judicial review by refusing induction when so
ordered.

Of course, this entails committing a felony and the penalty may
be up to five years’ imprisionment and or 10,000 dollars fine. To
point this out, the Guardian reports (Dec. 20, 1969) that Assistant
Attorney General Wilson stated that 1,839 men were prosecuted
during the first six months of 1969 for selective service violations
resulting in 915 convictions.

The Bison’s record now stands at
45. At the beginning of the season
many polls were predicting that the
Thundering Herd would wind up
with a 1-8 record.

But is it possible to measure a
successful season in terms of wins
and losses? Head coach Fred Pren-
der stated that he was “pleased
with the success of the team’s mem-
bers.”

Junior Howard Burke has de-

for 852 yards and is the team’s

To say that BU developed a run-

Coach Prender believes that,
“Diez has been the biggest plus for

Injuries play a key part in de-
termining a won-lost record. The
Bison line was to be the team’s
strong point this year. Co-captain
Gene DePew at left tackle anchored
a defensive line that proved to be
extremely aggressive, often against
much larger opponents.

Other outstanding contributors

this year on the line were George
Clayton, Tarras Onishenko, Bob
Rohrbaugh and John Klenovic.

In the defensive secondary, the
stellar performances of Gene Luc-
carrelli from his free safety slot
will place his name in the BU
record books. The steady play of
Tony Lucadamo and John Ondrasik
settled the outcome of many ball-
games while senior Greg Doviak
demonstrated the strong team spirit
by learning a new position halfway
through the season and filling in to
do a creditable job.

problem of the origin of evil

is beyond us. And to say that God could have created man

‘

rmountable difficulties.

As we study the Bible, we |

begin to see that the origin
of both good and evil in this
world lie only in man’s pow-
er of choice. Until a person
is faced with a choice of two
courses, and voluntarily re-
jects the wrong course, he

til he voluntarily rejects the
right course, he has never
committed sin. So it was with
Satan, no doubt; so it was
with Adam and Eve; and so
it is with us.

Now for God to have pre-

vented evil at the cost of pre- |

venting good in man would
have been an absurdity. It
would be like doing away
with the sun in order to get
rid of the shadows. A man
incapable of choice, a man

has never done good. Or un- |

without a will of his own, is

a contradiction of terms. He
is no man but a puppet,
whose actions have no virtue
because they are controlled
by a higher power.

Jesus Christ, who as God
| became man, had to undergo
temptation just as we do.
“He resisted unto blood
struggling against sin.” By
| man’s choice, sin came into
the world. By Christ’s choice,
victory over that sin also
came into the world. In God’s
plan, good will eventually tri-
umph over evil, even as it is
doing in individual lives to-
day. You can make the choice
to share in that victory by re-
ceiving Christ into your heart
| by faith.

Bisons Compete in IC4A’s
And Enter MAC Tourney

By ALAN GROCHAL

Running it the IC4A cross country
meet for the first time, the Herd
finished in the top ten in freshman
competition, but failed to place in
the upper class meet.

Five finishers are needed for a
school to get points, and the Bisons
had only four finishers on the var-
sity level.

Individually, Tom Hagerty turned
in the best B.U. time in the 5 mile
varsity race, with a fine 27:47 ef-
fort.

John Larner, Rich Francel, and
Rich Bullick were the other Bison

finishers. Bullick’s 5 mile feat was
of great personal satisfaction be-
cause he is usually a sprinter.

On the freshman level there were
two major bright spots. Scott Bart-
ram finished 21st with a 16:10 time
in the 3 mile race and Bob Lucas
came in 26th at 16:25,

Tom Gardner, Conrad Vandegaer
and Dave Gilroy placed in the 70’s
to earn the Herd a position in the
top ten out of 35 entering schools.

“For the most part, I’m pleased
with our performance,” commented
Coach Arthur Gulden.

Jay Griffin Carries High Hopes
Into Contest with Delaware

By DAVE COULTER

As the 1970 football season closes
the records show that the Bisons
have baffled those who predicted
a 0-9-1 season for the Herd.

Even though the squad has been
plagued by a long list of injuries,
which have staggered their hopes
and placed the burden on their de-
termination rather than their ex-
perience, the Blue team has
snatched victory from defeat and

ightened the picture of BU foot-
ball this year and in the future.

One of the Bisons who will be re-
turning next r to man the power-
ful Bison offense is Jay Griffin.

Jay began playing football as a
senior in high school after he tried
of the monotonous rigors of cross
country. Originally a defer

and later a BU frosh corner-
he is presently snaring passes
an offensive end.

Jay notes that the strong running
game which the Bisons have gen-
erated has really ‘“‘opened up the
whole offense, and helped me run
the patterns s a tight end lately,
I have been given more of an op-
portunity to catch the ball rather
th blocking. When you have a
balance between running and pass-
ing it makes them both go better.

It’s really hard to stop, especially

Looking back over the season
Jay feels the Herd had a success-
ful year” in that they did suprise
all the ‘experts’ but he expresses
“disappointment” in knowing that
“we should have won three of the
games we lost.”

He enthusiastically believes, that,
“Tf we can beat Delaware it will all
be worth it.”

The erratic nature of the Bisons
has been a big concern to the end,
he feels “We have the talent and
the depth, it’s just putting it to-
gether.”

Jay assesses the new Bison sche-
dule an an improvement, because
it provides an opportunity for the
Herd to compare itself with dif-
ferent teams in various conferences.

The extra travel is especially en-
joyable to Jay. He desires to work
his way to Europe or around the
world on a freighter. He wants to
see the rest of the world before he
sets his mind on a career or a di-
rection for the rest of his life.

Serving as an LUR to ABS is one
of the “different things’ which Jay
enjoys doing on campus. He feels
that this University does not over-
emphasize sports and thus allows
time for outside activities.

He also believes that this real-

ization that ‘‘sports are not every-
thing’’ is perhaps the cause of BU’s
apparent apathetic fan support.

Jay also reasons that there is
a two-way interaction between the
success of the team and the en-
thusiasm of the fans.

The Delaware game, though, is
the one that counts now, and Jay
expressed hope that “the Lehigh
game last week will inspire the fans
to come down to Delaware and sup-
port the team.” For this game will
not only be the end of the 1970
season, but will signify the beginn-
ing of the ‘71 season for Jay Grif-
fin and the Bisons.

Slipping in unnoticed I knew immediately it was going to be a worth-

the back of the gym. The costuming was earthy—browns, blues, greens

January Plan Registration
Increases From 1969 Total

By BILL WHITNEY

Dr. John W. Tilton, January Pro-
gram Director and Associate Pro-
fessor of English, recently an-
nounced that preliminary registra-
tion figures for the 1971 JanPlan
show a slight increase in student
participation over last year.

However, Dr. Tilton noted that
due to an overall rise in the number
of students on campus, he doubts
that the percentage of student par-
ticipation will increase.

Approximately twenty-five per
cent of Bucknell studente were in-
volved in a Jan Plan last year.

Dr. Tilton expressed that if there
is not a late surge in registration,
the 1971 program will be no bigger
than last year.

He felt that the percentage was
“surprising and disappointing,” and
stated that, “I want to be optimis-
tic, but I can’t see grounds for it
yet.”

Dr. Tilton stressed that registra-

tion is by no means closed and that
there is ample time to register for
both individual and group January
Programs.

The University’s January Pro-
gram was instituted by the faculty
in 1970 as a four year experiment.
In the spring of 1973, after the
fourth January, the faculty will vote
as to the continuation of the pro-
gram.

Commenting on the present regis-
tration figure s, Dr. Tilton said, “It
is still too early to prophesize, but
it is not a good sign for the con-
tinuation of the program if par-
ticipation remains at the level of
the past.’”

Dr. Tilton feels the success of
the experiment ‘‘will take on every-
one’s part that extra push, par-
ticularly towards planning a struc-
tured educational experience. That
extra push is to get it registered as
a project.”

Approximately sixty per cent of
the faculty participated in 1970 and

Two juniors, John A. Gardner,
and Jay R. Poliner, are co-authors
with Dr. Douglas K. Candland, pro-
fessor of psychology, of a paper de-
livered by Professor Candland at
the annual meeting of the Psy-
chonomic Society in San Antonio,
Texas, November 6.

Entitled “Correlates of Heartrate

key,’ the paper is a product of ex-

Middle Hast Expert
Gives Guest Lecture

Dr. Alvin J. Cottrell, Director of
Research, Center for Strategic and
International Studies, Georgetown
Unixersity, will be the first Mili-
tary Science guest speaker for Ac-
ademic Year 1970-71.

Dr. Cottrell will address the ROTC
cadets and interested members of
the University community at 12:45
p.m. December 3 in Vaughan Lit-
erature Auditorium.

He is a noted expert on Middle

4% ast affairs. His topic will be the
“Power Game in the Middle East.”

Dr. Cottrell received his MA and
PhD from the University of Pennsyl-
vania and is a 1964 graduate of
the National War College.

During World War II he was
awarded the Bronze Star for serv-
ice with the U.S. Army.

colony of squirrel monkeys main-
tained by the University’s Depart-
ment of Psychology.

The paper is a report of a long
range project, sponsored by a grant
from the National Science Founda-
tion, concerned with endocrine
changes in the formation of animal
societies.

Gardner’s and Poliner’s work on
the paper specifically involved pre-
paring and running various com-
puter programs used to analyze the
data from a full year measurement
of behavior heartrate.

In the paper, Dr. Candland, who
is chairman of the department of
psychology, shows how heartrate
can be measured by placing small
FM transmitters on the animals,
how the heartrate is converted for
computer storage, and how heart-
rate changes dramatically when the
social organization of an established
colony of primates is changed. The
paper shows that some forms of
socilization, like overcrowding, pro-
duce profound changes in the en-
docrine system which effect ag-
gression and longevity among the
animals.

Publication Dates

THE BUCKNELLIAN will only
publish one issue the week after
Thanksgiving. Because of the
holiday the Tuesday issue will
be deleted and one issue will be
published Thursday.

senior members of the department
met the week before.

Richard Drinnon, professor of
history and head of that depart-
ment, said that the committee ac-
tion was based on three points.

Drinnon said that Cushman’s the-
sis to obtain his docterate in his-
tory from the University of Mary-
land was not “history,” that Cush-
man was not working well with
the other members of the depart-
ment and that he (Drinnon) had re-
ceived several coplaints from stu-
dents about Cushman.

The senior members of the de-
partment include, John D. Kirk-
land associate professor of history,
Mark D. Neuman, also an associate
professor and Drinnon

Cushman will take his oral exam
for his Ph.d. in early December. He
has been teaching here since 1967.

In an interview with The Buck-
nellian, Cushman said he is unde-

cided about what action he will
take to try and reverse the decision
Cushman could submit the case to
the faculty committee on academic
freedom and tenure.

In response to the charges Cush-
man admitted that his thesis is not
history in the classical sense. He
said, ‘‘It has chapters on philosophy
religion and other fields which are
not ‘history’ but that doesn’t mean
that it can’t be history. My thesis
represents a change which I feel
American historians must make.
They must begin to see history
through the eyes of the people who
lived and wrote during a specific
period. History is more than just
facts.”

About the student complaints
Cushman commented, ‘I know that
some students like the way I teach
and others hate my method and me.
But I would rather have it that way.

“TI still remain convinced that
Bucknell’s Jan Plan is the most ex

try, and remains one of the greatest
chances for faculty and students to
demonstrate a meaningful contri

He feels that, “Bucknell offers
the month as a chance to get in
volved in an experience, so the in-
herent value is what the student
himself gets out of it

Dr. Tilton feels that a major ac
vantage of the Jan Plan structure
is that a student can concentrate
on a project and ] have time left
over for other activities. The dis
tractions of the regular semester

Draft Counseling Seminar Held

By ED MARSTON

A draft counseling training ses-
sion was held Saturday, November
14, sponsored by the Lewisburg
American Friends Society, a Quaker
group.

Allen Gibus, a draft counselor
from the Central Committee of Con-
scientious Objection in Philadelphia,
lead the five-hour session.

About 30 persons attended the
meeting, including Thomas J. Risch
Dean of Men and John C. Pyper
assistant Dean of College of Arts
and Sciences, University Chaplin
James E. Gardner, and James D.
Hammerlee, Director of Student
Programs.

Also in attendance were faculty
and students from this University,
Lycoming College, Susquehanna
University, and Lewisburg and Sel-
insgrove High Schools. However,
disappointment was expressed that
no local ministers chose to par-
ticipate.

Gibus emphasized the complex-

ities of the draft, due largely to
changes in the law caused by the
lottery system, the appointment of
a new Director of the Selective
Service, and recent court cases.

It was pointed out that the Se-
lective Service, and recent court
cases.

It was pointed out that the Selec-
tive Service System is administer-
ed by over 4000 local boards, often
staffed by part-time employees who
are not well acquainted with the
draft laws.

nellian, Dr. Gene Chenoweth, who
helped arrange the training session,
said that this meant that “you often
have to educate your board.”’ Most
local boards are more ignorant
than punitive, he said.

The importance of communication
with the local board was discussed
at the training session, including
the importance of keeping personal
copies of all requests and appeals
made to the board.

Gibus emphasized that the pur
pose of the draft counselor is not
to tell the individual what to do,
but rather with sensitivity and a
knowledge of the law to help him
know himself and make his own
decisions about the draft. This is
frequently difficult for the indi-
vidual pressured by family, com-
munity, and the demands of the
law.

One of the day’s activities which
dramatize the counseling of an in
dividual under cross-pressures w2s

J. Ernest Keen of the Psychology
department.

Also discussed at the sesson was
the need to provide draft informa-
tios to the poor and to blacks, v

available to middle-class whites.

Jack Schmidt, one student who at-
tended the session, later said he
would favor the est ablishment of
a formal organization for draft
counseling possibly as part of the

Letters to the Editor

Bill’s Violence

fo the Ec

You stated in your lead editorial
in the November 17th Bucknellian
that “Will Kunstler is a man of
eommitment (true) — commitment
to bringing radical change to this
nation (true) while attempting to
avoid violence (false).”

There is a saying that you can
know a man by the friends he
keeps and the words he has for his
friends, and it is in this frame of
reference that I would like to brief-
ly quote what this man says to
those that he considers to be his
ideologic friends

In a speech given before the
United Front inst Facism (a
Black Panther front) in July of
1969 and subsequently reprinted in
its entirety in the newspaper, the
Black Panther, (July 26th issue)
William Kunstler demonstrated his
true beliefs vis a vis the law when
he described graphically the stomp-
ing to death of John Gleason, a po-
liceman in Plainfield, New Jersey.
‘This policeman shot a Black man
in the stomach who had attacked
him with a hammer and, to quote
directly Mr. Kunstler—‘‘He (Glea-
son) was followed by a crowd of
black men and women. And a block
and a half past the intersection, he
was stomped to death. In my opin-
ion, he deserved that death . . . The
crowd, justifiably, without the ne-
cessity of a trial and in the most
dramatic way. possible, stomped
him to death.”

Kunstler in this speech, which is
devoted in its entirety to this inci-
dent, without question is condon-
ing lynch law. The quotation sighted
above is not taken out of context
because the context of the entire
speech concerns what is evidently
his concept of ‘justice.’ And this is

only one example of many that
may be sighted to demonstrate
William Kunstler’s true beliefs.

The New York Times in an in-
terview qquotes Kunstler thusly: “I
have every right to tell the stu-
dents to take out their lighters and
go down and burn up the bank, be-
cause my intent is to communicate
a thought, which WILL LEAD TO
AN ACTION. That’s what the ist
Amendment is all about.’’ To under-
score this fact that Kunstler evi-
dently DOES JUSTIFY arson, I
refer you to the Playboy Magazine
interview in the October 1970 issue
in which Kunstler stated: ‘Another
form resistance could take would
be the burning down of a particular
college building at a safe time. . .”
The Playboy interviewer responded
with ‘You condone arson? and
Kunstler stated in reply—‘‘Yes, if
a point has been reached in a giv-
en situation where the mechanisms
of society are not responding to
serious grievances. It depends on
the situation.”

It is evident, therefore, from the
above, that Mr. Kunstler must con-
done both murder and arson if
they are perpetrated on those
people or institutions he disagrees
with. And, to underline this last
point, one needs only look as far as
an interview Mr. Kunstler had with
Victor S. Navasky of the New York
Times in which he stated: “I only
defend those whose goals I share.
I'm not a lawyer for hire. I only
defend those I love.” And one of
his most noted clients is Jerry Rub-
in, whose goals he must share by
his own definition.

And Jerry Rubin, as quoted by
the Akron, Ohio Beacon Journal
said before a crowd of Kent State
students two weeks before the Kent
State tragedy: “The first part of

Education

By PAUL OSHER
‘Our struggle for a better world takes many forms, but none is
more important than the rearing and educating of our children. We
believe that children raised in wholeness and natural pride will
not grow up to be slavish adults, nor agree to immoral politics and

irresponsible technology.

“Our present system of public education, coercive in its meth-
ods, is a symptom and major cause of our unsatisfactory way of
life. It ignores the reqquirements of normal growth, subordinates
everything to centralize administration, and undermines the very
best of our democratic ideals. Perhaps this system can be chang-
ed from within. We hope so. But one thing is clear: it cannot be
changed without working models of a better way, both as examples

and as a competitive spur... .

“The function of the New Nation Seed Fund is to help new
schools get started, and existing ones stay alive. We ask you to re-
member this fund by thinking of it on your birthday, and we ask
you to send one dollar. If you are a parent, and do agree with us,
urge your own children and young people to ally themselves with
other children by sending small presents on their birthdays, 50 cents,
or a quarter. We cannot solve large problems with these sums, but
we can contribute to a large solution. Above all, we can keep alive
one of our few working models of freedom.

The money will be used exclusively for children. It will be
disbursed from the fund in consultation with reliable people in the
field of education, including the sponsors listed below. Priority will
be given to schools enrolling significant numbers of the poor.”

BECAUSE UNTIL YOU’RE PRE-

PREPARED TO CHANGE THE

fend Jerry Rubin’s ist Amendment

to also state that he “shares’’ the
goals of those he defends, when
the goals are such as quoted above,
is truly demonstrating this lawyer’s

If the Bucknellian has the courage
of ITS convictions, ie, the students’

To the Editor:

I am a senior at Temple Univer-

Education and Recreation. I read
your article “Boycott Phys. Ed.” in
our great newspaper ‘Temple

That article might be true for
Bucknell’s physical eeducation pro-
gram, but it isn’t true for Temple’s
H. P. E. R. program.

I have the funny feeling that
Bucknell is still mad at Temple
when T beat B in a football game

THE SIDESHOW ‘YI
Suburban Goes Camping |
By DAVID WEINBERGER

“Congratulations! You've been chosen by our advertising depart-
ment to receive two free gifts and a discount on a ‘Funstead’ in the
Poconos,” the letter from Indian Acres of the Poconos approximately
said. It promised me an expensive gift for just visiting them. So Linda,
Andy and I all went driving along Route 80 one morning.

Two hours later we were still giggling, trying to pretend that we
were going for the “‘lark,’’ and not for the gifts. We knew I was going
to be taken, but we had to find out how. Meanwhile, we drove past burnt-
out houses I would like to live in, past Quik-Stop Snack Shoppes, past
houses with plastic deer on their lawns, and through all the autumn-ness
in the Poconos that degrades all of the human-ness.

Indian Acres turned out to be a green circus tent set in the middle
of mounds of mud, with a cardboard sign out front that had “Office”
written on it in Fast-Dri Permanent Magic Marker (49c). So we were all
pretty amused. We could afford to be, because after all, we were not city
slickers or country bumpkins about to be taken.

A girl, about twenty years old, in dungarees, greeted us from behind
a desk. Very nice. We assumed that she was laughing on the inside at
the absurdity of what was going on around her. The tent was carpeted
and had picnic tables all around at which sat Young Salesmen smoking
cherry-blend tobacco in Dr. Grabow Medicated pipes worrying about
how they were going to dig out their cars which had baby’s booties
bronzed and hanging from the rear-view mirror and a “Middletown H.S.
Tigers” decal half peeled from their rear window.

We went to the indoor Bar--Q Grill to get our free All Beef-Burger
Luncheon. The woman working the grill, whose legs filled up her Capri
Pants like water in balloons, whose Cherry-Red Slick Lipstick by Max
Factor made her face look gray, looked at us and said “Oh, you’re kids!
I theught I was at Woodstock for a minute.” She reminded us that even
tolerant Lewisburg has only just learned that not everyone with long
hair is a Beatle. F

We were given a salesman who gave us the facts: Indian Acres
consists of 690 acres of prime land, divided into lots 40 by 80 feet. The
lots are all back to back, each lot is accessible by a road. Five million
dollars worth of recreation lodges are being built, with pools, tv's,
restaurants: everything necessary to convert a virgin forest into a re-
finished basement with a dart board on which you can play baseball in
case one sport is not enough for you, and a Fold-A-Way Ping Pong Table.

Our salesman took us on roads that looked like Hiroshima with a
hangover to where the available lots were. Each company Jeep-Sportser
had a radio to let the salesman know if the lot he is going to exhibit
has been sold while he is en route. They are selling faster than they
can build roads to get to them.

Andy asked if it would take another six months to get roads opera-
tional. “Another six months!,” the salesman exclaimed, “Why, we only
started clearing the roads four weeks ago.” Four weeks and half of
a centuries-old forest looked like a swamp making mud pies.

We got at lots 173-4 and looked around. “‘Your lot would stretch
from here to here,” the salesman said, indicating an area marked by
Day-Glo Lite-Reflecting Markers about as long as the smile leaving our
faces. The forest he pointed to was beautiful, probably at its height of
magnificence because we were near the center. The center is the part
that’s farthest away from 25¢ Laundromatics and Ethan Allen Pioneer
Furniture Stores. Everything sloped down from where we were.

Before us was no longer a forest, but Indian Acres Funsteads, with
white and chrome 30-foot Camper Convenient Car Trailers parked next
door. Electricity and water piped in. Muzak played on weekdays and
bird-calls on Sundays. Next door to us, a man in Dacron Bermuda Shorts
sits in a deck chair, escaping into the newspapers, cursing because the
bathroom is 4% a mile away and he’ll have to drive his car at 40 MPH

The Doctor’s Bag

By ARNOLD WERNER
ce 1970 CPS
Address letters to Dr. Arnold Werner, Box 974, East Lansing, Michigan
48823.

QUESTION: I have an acutely embarrassing and nerve-wracking problem
I have a very large vagina. It has been that way since my first sexual
experience, but it seems to be getting larger. The more sexually aroused
I am, the larger is my vagina.

My spouse seems rather concerned about my problem, although we
enjoy our sex life tremendously. I am getting worried that eventually it
will interfere with our enjoyment. I have heard that exercise may help -
if so, what kind? Please help me. I try to laugh at my husband’s humorous
(he thinks) insinuations, but I am really worried.

ANSWER: Masters and Johnson in their scholarly opus ‘Human Sexual
Response,”” published in 1966 by Little, Brown, comment at length upon
the physiological responses of the sexual organs during excitement. Among
their observations is the fact that the inner two thirds of the vagina ex-
pands tremendously during sexual excitement. This does not seem to
occur in the outer one third of the vagina.

There are a variety of muscles in the vaginal wall and surrounding
areas which are under voluntary control. Exercises are recommended
for women with relaxed vaginal opening as a variant of normal anatomy,
or as a result of pregnancy and childbirth. These helpful exercises are
not commonly used in this country. It may be because we have a heritage
of secrecy surrounding sex.

Letters to the Editor

(Continued from Page 2)
would like to answer that charge.

First, Mr. Koutnik charged that
our posting copies anonymously in-
dicated that we felt fear or shame
for what we were doing. The fact
of the matter is that it is irrelevant
who posted the copies. The only
parties who need to be recognized
are Kunstler himself, as the author
of the statement; and the source,
the Black Panther, so that the
authenticity of the statement can
be verified. These two parties were
recognized, and therefore all others
are inconseqquential.

Second, we point out that we
could not have quoted out of con-
text since we posted the whole
speech. The highlighting of certain
portions of the speech was not, as
Mr. Koutnik believes, intended to
misrepresent the rest of the con-
tent of the speech. It was intended
to call attention to the speech; to
interest students in reading what
Kunstler had actually said, with
the hope that they would read
further and be able to form an in-
telligent opinion of the man’s posi-
tion; to demonstrate what we
thought was the crux of the issue.
As far as that goes, our interpre-
tation is somewhat different from
Mr. Koutnik’s.

Kunstler was arguing for the
right of communities to self de-
fense. Mr. Koutnik was right in
saying “lynching is not an act of
self defense,”’ but neither was the
murder of John Gleason. There is
a difference between “‘self de-
fense”’ and the type of revenge ex-
evuted of Gleason. In self defense,
one attempts to prevent injury. In
this case, the injury had been done,
and Gleason, who caused it, was
leaving the ghetto, when he was
attacked by the crowd. A group of
people felt wronged and took it |
upon themselves to administer
“justice.” This is lynching, and
Kusstler’s defense for it has been
the defense for all lynch mobs. The

question of who was the first caus
of injury, Williams or Gleason, be-
comes irrelevant. Shooting it out in
the streets is not the way to guar-
antee the justice that the black
(and the white) community wants
and needs, and yet this is precisely
what Kunstler believes we should
be prepared to do whenever we feel
we have been severely wronged.

It is unfortunate for Mr. Koutnik
that he feels that the University
atmosphere encourages not thor-
oughness and objectivity in dealing
with problems, but their opposites.
Any student who does feel he has
time to read the entire Kunstler

PLANT MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT
PRODUCT ENGINEERING

PLANT INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
PLANT CHEMICAL ENGINEERING

Already 10th largest industry in the United States, papermaking is exploding with
new growth. And Charmin, as a producer of houshold paper products only, is a
pacesetter in the segment that is growing 3 times faster than the total industry!

Charmin’s entire operations are alive with new methods, new ideas, new processes,
new product concepts—and Charmin engineers are in the forefront of these develop-
ments. Now, as our marketing area expands beyond 75% of the U.S. population, we
need more engineers capable of bold new thinking.

Our rapid growth, combined with a practice of promotion from within, provides out-
standing advancement opportunities. We must significantly increase our manage-
ment organization in the next few years, providing opportunities at all levels in the

Bisons Bow to Delaware
In Season’s Grand Finale

By ERIC RIESS

The Big Blue Bisons, who have
been suprising everyone since the
beginning of the season, got the
biggest surprise of the season
Saturday when they tried to short
circuit Delaware’c own Big Blue
Machine.

The shock which the Bison’s re-
ceived was a disasterous 42-0 loss
to the Blue Hens.

The win was the third consecu-
tive victory for the Hens over the
Bisons and marked the largest
margin of victory ever compiled in
a BU-Delaware clash.

If there is any consolation gained
from the game it is that the team
that beat Fred Prenders’ men is
one which has been rewriting the
Hen record books for the past three
years, first under Tom Dimuzio and
now with Chuck Hall, leading the
assult

The Delaware ‘‘machine,” now
holds records for most points
scored, and most yards rushing, in
a season while Hall individually
holds records for most points
scored in a season, career, and
game (a record which he tied for
the third time Saturday).

Hall has also rushed for over
3,000 yards in his career as a Blue
Hen

The ground attack of coach ‘Tub-
by’ Raymond’s Hens has been the
teams’ strong point all season as
the Big Blue found out Saturday
as the Hens piled up 391 yards and
scored all but one of their TD’s by
that route.

The first came at 10:39 of the
first period when Hall crashed over
from the two yard line capping a
43 yard drive. The score put Hall
over the 3,000 yard mark for his
career.

The Bison offense was unable to
gain any more than two consecutive
first downs whenever it got the ball
and the BU defense stiffened al-
lowing the Hens only four downs
whenever they had the ball. Bill
Lane and Grady Kahoe traded
punts until midway through the
second period when the Hen of-
fense began moving from their own
31 yard line. Eleven plays later
Jim Colbert, sprinted around left
end from his quarterback slot
giving the home team a 140 lead
after the PAT.

But after the Kickoff Howie
Burke began to move the BU of-
fense and after seven plays Burke
had a first and ten from the Dela-
ware 19.

A 147 halftime score against the
powerful Hens probably would have
been enough to power, what has
come to be the patented BU come-
from-behind type of game.

But when Burke was caught for
a loss attempting to pass on third
down and Dave Boyer’s 37 yard
field goal attept sailed just wide
to the left the Bisons had found

play of the game.

Farbstein was trying to go up the
middle and was hit hard by the
center of the Hen line.

The Blue Hens recovered and
scored a demoralizing 210 lead.

After another Delaware score at
10:35 of the third period the Bisons
tried another comeback.

Starting from his own 10 Burke
directed the offense down to the
Delaware 12. On the final play of
the third period the Bisons were
called for unneccessary roughness
and the ball moved back to the
Delaware 27.

But four plays and three con-
secutive losses later the Blue Hens
took over as everything went wrong
for Burke. That was the last time
the offense showed any spark and
the tired and spiritless defense
could do little to stop the method-
ical Blue machine.

The final stats show that the run-
ning attack of the Hens more than
compensated for the fact that Burke
completed 18 of 31 passes for 157
yards over Colberts 3 for 13 and 29
yards

Jay Griffing caught 5 of Burke’s
passes and Rick Diez showed
sparks of brightness leaving some
hope that next year when ‘Tubby’
Raymond brings his new big Blue
machine into Memorial stadium it
will be no surprise if the Bisons
leave it dismantled on the BU
gridiron.

Grapplers

Rivoire, Loesch Co

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

The Blue and Orange grapplers
more than held their own against
some stiff competition as the new
head wrestling coach, Rich Shu-
maker, took eight members of his
team to the East Stroudsburg Open
this past weekend.

The Bisons picked up 11 team
points.

Over 500 wrestlers from all over
the country entered the Open and as
an example of the type of compe-
tition, there were 2 national champs
and 4 other national place winners
in the finals.

Blue Icers Open Practice
For ’70 MAHL Campaign

By GEORGE LANE

Soon after Thanksgiving break,
you might start seeing about 15-20
men carrying long thin sticks, wear-
ing blue shirts, funny pants and
striped socks, gathering in front of
the Bookstore around three o’clock
every afternoon. These men will be
faced with such innocent questions
as, “Has lacross practice started
already?” or ‘Hey, what are you
guys all dressed up for?”’

No, lacrosse practice won't be
starting that early and what they'll
be dressed up for is hockey—that’s
right, hockey.

What you'll be seeing is the Bison
Ice Hockey Club on its way to one
of its daily practices in Sunbury is
preparation for making its latest
bid to rise to the top of the Middle
Atlantic Hockey League.

This will be a rebuilding wear for
the Icers. Last Year’s graduation
claimed the entire first forward
line of Jock Mitchell, Jon Apgar
and Doc Reimer.

Never before have freshman had
as good an opportunity to win top
starting positions as the club tries

Freshman Tom Wason at 118
made Shumacher’s debut a big
success as he defeated Nerier from
the U of Buffalo in an exciting,
come from behind 8-6 match. Wason
also picked up a win by default be-
fore losing to an opponent from Rut-
gers.

The Bisons entered two wrestlers
in the 150 pound weight class, junior
Tom Rivoire and sophomore Stan
Dancer.

Dancer won his first bout against
Franklin from Morgan 9-4 before
losing a controversial decision to
Neeler of FDU at the buzzer, 4-2.

which the Bisons will be able to
build a potent offense. Jim Daven-
port, Hunt Worth and Floyd Wallace
will tackle the defensive chores
while Steve Levings and George
Cane will be back tending goal.

The Bisons will open their season
on Dec. 5th against a tough foe, Le
high, last year’s MAHL champs.

After that game the Bisons will
face other teams from Lafayette,
Rutgers, Villanova, the Academy of
the New Church and will wrap up
the season on March 13th against
the amateur North Penn Eagles.

The Bisons face a tough schedule,
representing a school where there
is little student support for the
sport of hockey. Despite this, they
will practice four days a week and
travel to Allentown to play most of
their games

The reason is simple.

Everyone who is on the team is
there because he loves the sport.
As long as he’s playing, nothing else
really matters.

With the love of the sport com-
bined with constant hard, but en-
joyable, work will come the Bison’s
ample share of victories.

be $12,009. In the article, ‘Rising

Ahe AAUP found that, ‘“‘Taking into
account the rise in price level, the

According to John Peeler, Chair-

with particular emphasis on des-
crimination of women faculty mem-

hiring married couples.

It was noted that there was an
average discrepancy between male
and female faculty members’ sala-

much less for assistant professors

However, after close .analysis

Another topic for discussion was
the criteria and method used in the
evaluation of faculty performance

In response to the University’s
latest ‘bomb threat’ John F. Zeller,
vice president of business and fi-
nance, has issued a set of guide-
lines for use by University officials.

The guidelines indicate proced-
ures to be followed to ‘‘insure the
safety of everyone involved,” in
Zeller’s words.

The latest bomb threat came
Wednesday morning at approxi-
mately 1:00 a.m. when an anony-
mous caller phoned the University’s
campus police and indicated that a
bomb had been planted on the
third floor of New Dorm.

The caller said, according to
Ray Musser, the on-duty officer at
the University’s emergency num-
ber, “The Weathermen are here.
There is a bomb on the third floor
of New Dorm. It is running out.”

After getting the call, Musser no-
tified the security police who noti-
fied Miss Marjorie Peck, the head
resident of New Dorm, who evac-
uated the building

After evacuating the building, the
bomb squad of the state police bar-
racks in Milton was notified. Af-
ter a complete search of the floor
by the state police, students were
allowed to re-enter the building at
approximately 3:30 a.m.

Motions Prepared for Faculty Meeting

Plan Organizes
Ecology Group

By LYNDA ROSCOE

At the University faculty’s De-
cember meeting, Dr. Dennis Mar-
chand, assistant professor of geol-
ogy and geography, will present a
motion “that an Environmental Co-
ordinating and Advisory Commit-
tee be established as a standing
University committee.”

In discussing factors prompting
his proposal, Dr. Marchand noted
that a number of students and fac-
ulty members had approached him
last year with suggestions, follow-
ing Earth Day and the Colloquy
program.

He also pointed out that questions
directed to him in the past con-
cerning physical facilities here have
indicated to him the misinformation
or lack of information about such
facilities.

“However, these are not my ma-
jor reasons for proposing an en-
vironmental committee,”’ explained
Dr. Marchand. “Rather I would
like to see the institution of a
mechanism by which the entire
community can draw together the

expertise available in a small uni-

versity with large, well-developed

physical sciences, so-

es, and humanities de-

, which can all contribute

to studying the environmental
question.”

Organizations Receive Money

Appropriation Committee Grants Funds

By SUE PRESTON

The Association of Bucknell Stu-
dents’ Appropriations Committee
has given approximately $5800 to
nine organizations this semester.
This money is in addition to the
approximately $60,000 they appro-
@riated for the current year to
various organizations after their
budget hearings last spring.

The groups and the amount of
money they received include: Ex-
perimental College $50, Water Polo
Club $475, Intercollegiate Debate
Society $670, Bison Pep Band $50,
Men’s Intramurals $200, Student
Information Service $1257.50, Tris-
tram $1200, Photography Club $1500,
and Independent Men $400.

Some of these requests were from
organizations who were not in ex-
istence last spring. Others were

from organizations who were ap-
pealing their case to receive more
operationg funds.

The appropriations committee
consists of the five ABS officers and
the five at-large officers. The
money they receive to appropriate
funds is taken out of the general
student fee.

Recently they drew up some
guidelines to consider while de-
bating budget requests.

In allocating student funds the
committee tries to keep in mind
the ‘“‘social good’”’ of the organiza-
tion, ie. in what ways “‘the money
will broaden and enrich the Uni-
versity and the community.”

Priority is given to recognized
student organizations and no aca-
demic department shall receive
ABS funds. Priority will be given

also based on the “value”
group to the University community
and not necessarily according to
the size of its membership.

Organizations desiring funds for
food, lodging and transportation ex-
penses will be asked to share a
part of this expense. Organizations
desiring funds for a conference or
to plan an event are referred to the
conference committee or the com-
mittee on cooperative funding, both
subsidized by the ABS.

Other areas the committee will
be investigating include the purpose
behind having advisors of student
organizations sign checks, and the
possibility of the ABS also funding
the Association of Women Students
and the University chorale, band,
choir and orchestra, all currently

Dateline: The Campus

By CATHLEEN EVANS
Berkeley (CPS) — Using the method of initiative, a group in
Berkeley is planning to circulate petitions to place on next April’s

cit
Be

ballot a proposal for a peace treaty between the people of
ley and the National Liberation Front of Vietnam. The peti-

tion, requiring enough signatures to equal five percent of the en-
tire vote cast in the last municipal election to make the ballot,
would become a city ordinance if passed. The 1,800 signatures re-
quired, can easily be collected from the registered voters attend-
ing the Univrsity of California at Berkeley, The petition, in addi-
tion to authroizing five representatives of the city to be delegated
to the NLF and Vietnamese people, demands that the United States
withdraw its troops from Southeast Asia and cease to support the
present South Vietnamese government. It also declares that no
Berkeley citizn will serve in the war. If the proposal were to pass,
Berkeley would have to secede from the Union. The U.S. Constitu-
tion explicitly prohibits the signing of treaties by any local govern-

ment.

Penn State — Nov. 17, Robert McHugh, editor of “The Daily
Collegian” was suspended by a special meeting of the papers
publisher after complaints of violation of privacy from the Black
Students Union. The paper published an account of a meeting of
the group on November 5, which was supposedly closed to the press.
“The Board accepted the view that the article tended to increase
racial tensions on campus and .. . felt that, though there are pre-
cedents for reporters in resorting to eavesdropping to get informa-
tion, the action in connection with the BSU meeting was improper
and that the practice in general is undesirable.” McHugh responded
that the increase in tensions was “largely due to the response of
some biacks,” and contended that “I don’t think a misjudgement

of my part warranted suspension.”

FEEDBACK: The Individual and Intercollegiate Athletics

To the Editor:

It should be pointed out that In-
tercollegiate competition is volun-
tary, and that a person who tries
out for a particular sport is under
no obligation to do so. He has made
a choice; then he must follow the
procedures, rules and standards
that a particular coach has set
down, including the training rules,
the practice schedules, the dress
code on away trips and the groom-
ing code. It is to my understanding,
I wish to be corrected if I am
wrong, that the individual coaches
at Bucknell have been given the
authority by the Athletic Director
to make up their own training
schedules, regulations and so on,
so long as these rules do not con-
flict with the basic policies es-
tablished by Bucknell’s Athletic De-
partment, the NCAA or the part-
icular conference the school belongs
to, in this case the Mid-Atlantic
Conference. As example of a con-
lict that did not involve the policies
set by Bucknell’s Athletic Depart-
ment, occurred two years ago at
Bucknell. It involved the new NCAA
rule pertaining to all participants
and people associated with the sport
xf wrestling. The rule specifies that
411 people involved in the sport of
wrestling shall be clean shaven. At
the time, the manager of the wrestl-
ing team was sporting a beard and
the Athletic Director, Mr. Latour,
dismissed the manager because he

sd to shave off his beard. Mr.

I understood what hap-

ectly, decided that the

was closely related to the

sport wrestling and that the

manager should comply with the

NCAA rule. I agree with Mr. La-

tour’s decision and if one does not

then one is questioning a

gement which is rela-

particular person. In

case Mr. Latour thought it

pest to dismiss the manager - his

judgement versus your particular

udgement. Someone has to be in

the position to make decisions, and

when a decision must be made with-

in the Athletic Department dealing

with policy, Mr. Latour is in such

a position. It is not a pleasant job

at times being Athletic Director,

but decisions have to be made and

Mr. Latour has done an outstanding
job in this position

Once the individual coach has
set up his regulations and stan-
dards, he must also have the re-
sponsibility to see that his regula-
tions are up-held. Since the coach,
and all athletic ‘sonsel, in under
the immediate direction of the Ath-
letic Director, the Athletic Director
has the final responsibility in all
matters pertaining to his depart-
ment. In the matter of dress codes
and grooming codes, he must back
ip his staff because he has dele-
gated to them the authority to make
these various regulations and stand-
ards. If any of these regulations or
standards are contrary to the Ath-
letic Director’s basic beliefs and the
interest of the particular team as
a whole, then he must advise the
particular coach of such discrepen-
cies in basic policy and take the ap-
propriate measures to alleviate the
problem.

Smith’s Policies

Coach Smith has been the basket-
ball coach at Bucknell for a number
of years. His views on what are ap-
propriate dress and grooming stand-
dards are known to the Athletic
Director, the basketball players and
the general public. Since his poli-
cies are widely known, it must be
assumed that the Athletic Director
has approved of them and that he
will back Coach Smith in his action.
It also must be assumed that the
administratios has approved of
these regulations, not only in basket-
ball but in all sports. (I’m not say-
ing that this “approval” by the ad-
ministration is right or wrong, but
I’m basing my assumption on their

‘silent’’ approval.) Therefore, the
player in question, without forcing
the issue, decided to quit the team
instead of getting his hair cut. His
choice was one of “individual con-
science’ and he must of thought
(I will assume) that the regulation
concerning short hair (how short I
I do not know) was contrary to his
belief in individual freedom of
choice.

The Bucknellian (Friday, Novem-
ber 13) criticized Coach Smith’s de-
cision and said that “the rights of
the individual must be guarded.”

When someone has elected to join
an athletic team, particularly os the
varsity level, he gives up some of
his cherished individual rights. I
guess this is a necessary evil in
order to insure proper discipline,
proper training procedures, team
morale, team spirit and team unity.
I do not believe that one will be
able to fully understand what I
mean unless he or she has joined
an athletic organization and has
traised and competed within this
organization. The guide lines that
are established by a particular
athletic organization provide for the
best possible coaching techniques
and the best possible performance
of the team.

In Training

In the training phase of any sport,
the individual, as many coaches
will testify, must give 120% in what-
ever he may do. The rigorous train-
ing procedures in modern athletic
activities commands total dedica-
tios of one’s mind and body No
one will succeed if he does not
dedicate himself to the task ahead
of him, One cannot separate the
mind from the body or the body
from the mind and expect to
achieve the goals he has set for
himself. This “‘organismic concept”
pertains to athletic activities as
well as to the academic subjects
one may elect to take. This dedica-
tion will demand some sacrifices
on the part of the players and the
coaches, but the coach must main-
tain what he beleives are sound and
justifiable policies is order to in-
sure the best possible performance
of the team as a whole, not in-
dividual by individual. This is not
to say that the coach should not be
concerned with each individual’s
performance, but the coach is re-
sponsible to other publics, the ad-
ministration, the Athletic Depart-
ment, the student body, the com-
munity and the team’s opponent, to
insure the proper function of his
players as a team, not as indi-
viduals.

From my experiences in swimm-
ing, spanning 15 years, I have
realized that I was restricted in
what I could do in order to attain
perfection. I’m not saying that I
ever attained perfection, or even
came close, but perfection ‘some
type of goal) is something that the
majority of athletes strive for
through their athletic careers Per-
fection can be stated in various
ways, such as a particular time
one wants to swim the 100 yd. free-
style, the percentage of free throws
made, a team’s won-lost record,
the score (grade) on a psychology
test and so on. One usually con-
siders a 100 as a perfect score, but
is it? If one stops to think about
the general educational philosophy
of the university environment, the
objectives one wishes to attain and
the methods one uses to attain
these objectives, is 100% on any
test really perfection? Or is it not
simply the student regurgitating the
professor’s class lectures and for-
getting it until the final? Or just
forgetting the material entirely?
Everyone has their own concept of
perfection and the ways to go about
achieving it. The athletic coach
has his methods and he will use
them until he finds a better way.

Sacrifices

To attain perfection one must be
willing to make sacrifices. Some
sacrifices an athlete may have to
make may include not smoking or
drinking during the season, not go-
ing out the night before an athletic
contest, getting the proper amounts
of sleep, rest and nutritional foods
and even getting a hair cut. These
sacrifices no doubt infringe upon
the individual rights of a person.
The person who fails to adhere to
these training procedures may be
able to perform adequately, or in
some cases, he may throw in a
superior performance, but these
people are the exception to the
rule. The coach must think of the
team as a unified group of in-
dividuals striving for a goal, and
this goal will take extremely hard
work and many sacrifices on the
part of each and every individual,
not just some.

‘Togetherness
The coach (in swimming for ex-
ample) has 16 to 20 men to con-
sider, not just two or three super-
stars, Superstars are great, but
they do not win the meet! It takes

PLO OY a ae

a team effort and everyone con-
tributing their share to attain the
victory. The rules and regulations
pertain to all members of the team,
no exceptions can be made or else
the coach will lose the respect of
his players. If the coach loses the
respect of his players then he will
be dealing, not wtih a team, but
with 16 to 20 individuals who will
be trying to get away with what-
ever they can. The team will lose
its identity, its character and its
togetherness. This “togetherness”
was not present on last year’s swim-
ming team and it resulted in our
losing the MAC Championship to
Lehigh University. The swimming
team, as any athletic team at
Bucknell, is composed of factions.
The swimming team failed to
bridge the gap between these fac.
tions; various fraternities compet-
ing against each other, both for
team glory and Freshman rushees,
the divers and swimmers were not
very close, the swimmers against
the managers and various indi-
viduals openly criticizing and fight-
ing amongst the other members of
the team. This was not conducive
to high team morale, team spirit
and cheerful and pleasant work-
out conditions. Mr. Russell and Mr.
Jenkins tried to bring the team
together as best they could, but it
took until Friday night of the MAC’s
the team trailing by 19 points, that
we finally gelled into a team, a
team that came out fighting Satur-
day. The team still lost, but the
bus ride back was not one in which
a losing team was riding in. It was
a totally different team! I think it
was a team that realized the im-
portance of the other guy, the im-
portance of a team effort, the im-
portance of total dedication to one
single goal and the importance of
sacrificing certain rights (individual
rights) for the benefit of team
unity. Last year was not a team
effort, it was what one individual
could achieve versus another pre-
son’s achievements. I hope this
year’s team will work-out and per-
form as a team, not just like a
team!
The Good and Bad

A player has to live by the rules
laid down by the coach if the team
is to succeed in its goal. The in-
dividual therefore gives up some of
his rights for the benefit of the
team and his teammates. One can-
not be selfish, or so individualistic
that he demands special treatment
that cannot be awarded to all. A
team must work together, each
member is an integral part of a
highly trained and precisioned unit,
striving for perfection (the con-
ference title, a victory over one’s
arch-rival or some other pre-de-
termined goal). Therefore, when an
individual thinks about joining an
intercollegiate team, he must weigh
the good against the bad. He will
have to sacrifice (relinquish) some
of his individual rights so the team
can function as a unit. Some pro-
fessors announce that more than
three or five cuts will affect one’s
grade. Does not this rule restrict
an individual’s freedom? Some pro-
fessors and coaches feel that such
standards (standards on number of
cuts allowed and length of one’s
hair) are vital to the performance
of the individual in class or on an
athletic team.

In today’s society there are many
regulations and rules that one must
obey in order for the proper func-
tioning of society as a whole to
take place. There are also certain
standards that one must meet in
order to qualify for some partic-
ular position, and intercollegiate
athletics is no different. The qual-
ifications place restrictions upon
the indicidual, but the individual
has the choice of whether he wants
to join the group or not. Inter-
collegiate athletics is voluntary and
it is selective. The unqualified in-
dividual has intramural activities,
the instructional classes, recre-
ational facilities and community fa-
cilities to satisfy his desire for
physical activity. Intercollegiate
athletics is not for everyone, and
it does not pretend to be. Those
who qualify and make the team are
usually the best qualified person-

nell available to the coach. Only
those who are willing to sacrifice,
and put in the many hours, the
sweat and the pain, will make it.
What about those who do not make
it? They usually cut themselves for

one reason or another. It might be
too time consuming, too much
work, too emotional and mental
stress and strain or not getting a
hair cut. Whatever the reason may
be, the individual usually does the
cutting himself, but in some in-
stances the coach may have to
exert his authority, as would have
been the case with Coach Smith
if the individual in question had
shown up the following day without
having had his hair cut.
Justifiable Rules

In our society, rules and regula-
tioss must be made and enforced if
it is to function properly. You may
not like this but it happens to be
the case until said rules and regu-
lations are changed. In athletics, in
which there is social interaction,
rules must be made and enforced.
Some rules will undoubtedly re-
strict the individual’s personal
rights but these regulations are
both necessary and justifiable. I
dare say that the great athletes of
modern time would not have been
so great if it were not for their
giving up certain of their individual
rights. If one thinks that he is
so important to the team thes he
will want to respect the coach’s

judgment concerning training reg-
ulations. A good athlete would not
question. the coach’s judgment un-
less of course it would involve phys-
ical harm to himself or to any other
individual involved in the sport. I
cannot see what possible physical
harm, mental anguish or emotional
setback is caused by getting one’s
hair cut. If long hair is so im-
portant to the individual then he
need not play basketball. But if
playing baskebtall is considered
more important than having long
hair then one would comply with
the standard set down concerning
the length of one’s hair and join the
team. A team is a unified group
of individuals that work-out togeth-
er, play together and should have
fun together. No one individual
makes a team great; rather it is
a combination of the various indi-
vidual’s talents and personalities
that makes the team function prop-
erly. The choice is yours!

| Hw About Some Answers?

By PAUL OSHER

Charlie Watts stated an answer to a questionaire he received from

the President’s Commission on Campus Unrest that:

“The president of

the University must be available to student leaders, must explain the

workings of campus bureaucracy,

reduce the likelihood of disruption or

and must exert true leadership” to
violence on the campus in the future.

I can only conclude that he has changed his mind

Over a month ago I asked him to comment on several items that
might be of some interest to the University. Among them: what are his
present activities concerning the recommendations submitted to him last

spring by the Committee on Differently Prepared Students;

what reason

does he have for delaying action on the status of Theta Delta Chi fra-
ternity; when will he permit the individual dormitories to govern them-
selves; and what issues were to be brought up at this December’s Board
of Trustees meeting. One could consider his silence an explanation of

campus bureaucracy.

He is presently in the midst of very important deliberations with the
Board which will set the tone of the program cut-backs that we can ex-
pect as a result of our perilous financial situation. He probably will be

coming up with a statement of hi

The news that he is being consi

s intent to resign soon, too. F
dered for the top administrative post

at Harvard is hardly unexpected. If Charlie doesn’t get that job, he is
still more than likely looking elsewhere for employment either next year or
the year after. Despite his deficiencies (isolating himself from the campus
and toeing a moderate line so as not to upset our doddering Board) he
has effected some profound changes here, and has presided over a campus
that has avoided any violent activity during a most turbulent era (who
deserves more (dis) credit, he or we?).

Crime Wave
To the Editor:

If we compare Bucknell to the
U.S. and the Bookstores shop-lifting
problem to the nation’s crime wave,
it’s posisble to apply several phil-
osophies to solve the problem. List-
ed below are only four possibili-
ties:

1. Legalize theft; By doing away
with needless laws against theft
we can stop crime.

2. Improve the environment; By
giving these socially disadvantaged
individuals an opportunity to ad-
vance we can decrease their need
to steal.

3. Unleash the pigs; If we shoot
the offenders we will rid the school
of the criminal element and keep
society pure.

4, Preach the Good News; If we
stop professing atheism in our
classrooms perhaps those individ-
uals would have had the necessary
spirit to resist temptation.

These are not the only possibili-
ties open to us but those professors
who claim an interest in solving
national problems should find some
solution and effect change in the
system to correct the problem as
they see it.

Senate Explained
Letter to Community:

The following is a synopsis of the
faculty passed Senate document:
hopefully, printing this letter will
increase student participation at
ABS meetings.

PURPOSE

The purpose of the University
Senate is to provide for a due shar-
ing of the authority delegated to
it by the Board of Trustees, through
the President. This body shall in-
vestigate, consider and recommend
policies which it deems of com-
mon concern to the University com-
munity.

The purpose of the Senate is not
to infringe on the responsibility and
authority of the President and the
Faculty, but to provide a forum

“4 where other constituent bodies may
join in providing counsel on the
proper course of the University.

FUNCTIONS

1. The Senate will receive annual
reports on the maters of staff,
physical facilities, and financing
It will study these matters and rec-
ommend any changes concerning
the methods by which these mat-
ters are handled. It will also rec-
ommend policies to the President
guiding student enrollment, financ-
ing, and priorities for the principal
allocations of the general budget,
and it will review the budget after
it is adopted. (No recommenda-
tions regarding the use of the budg-
et allocated to the formal program
of instruction over the objections of
a majority of the Faculty.)

2. To review and recommend pol-
icy concerning scheduling of class-
es (Committee on Academic Sched-
ule).

3. To review and recommend pol-
icy guiding admission and financial
aid (Committee on Admissions and
Financial Aid).

4. To review and recommend pol-
icy guiding student organization,
housing, and extracurricular activ-
ities (Committee on Student Life).

5. To concern itself with anything
the Faculty, students, or President
refer to it, and to request that
these bodies reconsider any policy
decisions it deems advisable.

6. To advise the President in the
appointment of the Provost, and
other major officials and to advise
the Board of Trustees in the ap
pointment of the President.

If no objection is raised, by either
the ABS or the Faculty, the issue
will be resolved by an arbitrating

* group, and resubmitted. If objec-

tion is raised a second time, the
issue will go to the Arbitration Com-
mittee (Provost, Secretary of the
Senate, and the Secretary of the
Faculty) and their decision will be-
come policy upon Presidential ap-
proval.

COMPOSITION OF SENATE

The Senate will consist of 15
Faculty, 8 students, and 7 officers
of the administration.

All faculty members are eiigible
to be senators, the term is for two
years, and no senator may run for

two full consecutive terms.

The student members shall be the
President of ABS, and seven stu-
dents elected at large (none of
whom may be members of ABS).
All full time students having a 2.3
GPA are eligibie. At least one stu-
dent from each college must be
elected, otherwise the 7 students
with the highest number of votes
shall be declared elected. The term
of ofifce is for one year, and a sen-
ator may be reelected only once.

The administrative members are
the President, Provost, VP/BF, the
Deans of the Colleges, the Dean of
Student Affairs, and one member
elected biennially.

OFFICERS OF SENATE

The President shall serve as
Chairman of the Senate; the Sen-
ate shall elect an Executive Sec-
retary from its Faculty member-
ship, and Associate Executive

Secretary from its student mem-
bership.

MEETINGS AND AGENDA

The Senate shall normally meet
twice a month, but special meet-
ings may be called by two sen-
ators, and such meetings will be
open to members of the admin-
istration, alumni, faculty, students,
and trustees.

Any matter appropriate for Sen-
ate consideration proposed in writ-
ing by the President, Faculty, ABS,
or any five members of the com-
munity shall be placed on the
agenda.

COMMITTEES

Faculty members will be elected
by the Faculty by means of a mail
ballot.

The ABS will nominate one can-
didate for each Senate and Faculty
committee position, and any other
student receiving 25 signatures en-
dorsing his candidacy are eligible,
and their names will be placed on
the ballot.

The term of office shall be for
one year for students and two years
for Faculty. No Faculty member
shall serve more than four con-
secutive years on the same com-
mittee. No senator shall serve on
more than one committee of the
Senate, Faculty, or the ABS at a
time. No faculty member shall
serve simultaneously on more than
two committees of the Senate and
Faculty, and no student on more
than one.

Studests make up approximately
14 of the membership on the Sen-
ate Committees, with the exception
of the Committees of Student Life,
and Supplementary Programs,
where they constitute about %2.

Ad hoc committees on academic
affairs shall be established only
after notification to the Faculty
and in consultation with the Fac-
ulty Committee on Elections and
Membership.

AMENDMENTS

Future amendments to the Sen-
ate may be proposed in the follow-
ing ways:

1. By a majority of the voting
members of the Senate; 2. By a
majority of the Faculty voting; 3.
By % majority of the ABS voting;
4, By the President.

Future amendments will become |
effective upon receiving, the follow-
ing: 1, A %4 majority of the voting
Faculty; 2. A majority vote of the
voting members of ABS; 3. The ap- |
proval of the President.

RATIFICATION
The remaining ratification pro-
cedures are as follows: First, the |

ABS shall accept, amend or reject |

or rejects the proposal (this seems
to be the likely outcome at the mo-
ment), the matter shall be forward-
ed to the Conference Committee
(composed of five students and five
Faculty) where differences will be
resolved.

The final document will then be
forwarded to the Faculty and stu-
dent body, where a %4 majority
vote of students shall constitute ac-
ceptance.

Upon Presidential acceptance,
the Senate will then become oper-
ational.

Hopefully,
Robert Wendel

Protest

To the Editor,

Two weeks ago, Fabia and I
visited Lewisburg. On Saturday
morning we and four of our Lewis-
burg friends participated in a virgil
for peace at the Post Office. The
peace vigil was started in the fall
of 1967 and it was our intention
to continue it until the war in Viet-
nam ended.

Well, the war continues. On that
weekend, Nixon bombed North Viet-
nam. The Defense Department has
admitted that the bombing was not
limited to the area south of the
19th parallel. In fact, missiles were
fired at the Hanoi area. Further,
the Administration admitted invad-
ing North Vietnam.

Nixon is trying to win the war
militarily. The air strikes were not
retalitory but were used to destroy
supplies stored in North Vietnam.

As Nixon continues to “withdraw”
ground troops he will increase
bombings, ‘‘justifying”’ the air
strikes as being necessary for the
protection of the troops in Vietanm.

The Administration and its war
are causing havoc with the econ-
omy. When Nixon took office, one
in 30 workers was unemployed. To-
day, one in 18 workers is unem-
ployed.

Nixon and his war must be stop-
ped. There are those who have and
there are those who are willing to
give their lives to end the war.
There are those who have spent,
are spending, or are risking long
prison terms in order to end the
war in Vietnam. We haven’t succe-
eded yet. We need large amounts
of support.

I am asking that you participate
in a peace vigil every Saturday
at the Post Office for one hour
starting at 11 a.m. It isn’t a lot to
ask and it isn’t enough. I could ask
that you spend an hour each week

demonstrating at the gates of the
Federal prisions. I could ask that
you not be content with dodging
the draft, but resist it. I do ask
that you do everything you can,
whether legal or not, to end the
war.

Peace,

Right On

By JERRY NORTON

‘ One of the funniest things Joan Baez said in her recent Playboy
interview was that she wasn’t paying some 80% of her taxes be-
cause that’s how much was going to defense. Joan’s is an extreme
example of the thinking that believes that there needs to be a
“shift in priorities” from defense to domestic spending, and that
the defense budget is a bloated, out-of-contro] monster

5 In point of fact, a shift in priorities has been going on since
1959. At that time defense expenditures were 51 percent of the total
federal budget. By 1969 they’d declined to 44 percent, and will drop

to 36 percent in 1971. Maybe, Joan is basing her figures on World
War II?

In dollar terms, of course, the defense budget has increased.
It was $46.6 billion in 1959; it was $81.2 billion in 1969. There will
be a hefty cut in 1971, dropping it to $73.6 billion.

That dollar increase has to be weighed against a federal budget
that has grown from under $100 billion in 1959 to well over $200
billion in 1971. When inflation is substracted from the defense
budget, the startling fact emerges that real dollar expenditures
for defense — outside of Vietnam — have grown virtually not at
all for more than 10 years, and have declined considerably as a
percentage of the federal budget and of the gross national product.
Finally, as the 1971 budget indicates, as the war winds down Viet-
nam spending is indeed being shifted not to other parts of the de-
fense budget, but to domestic needs.

This may all be good news to liberals, who see carrying out
utopian schemes at home as more important than defending the
country from its “enemies,” who after all, are mere mirages
created by the deluded minds of conservatives

Other countries, unfortunately for the liberal version of the
world, have not been behaving over the past decade as though
they are unconcerned about their military strength. The Soviet
Union has been rapidly building its defenses to the point where
America’s strategic lead of the 1950’s and early ’60’s has dis-
appeared.

The USSR has 220 early model ICBMs to America’s 54; 800
small ICBMs to America’s 100; 300 large ICBMs to America’s none;
300 sub launched cruise missles to America’s none; and, 280 sub
launched ballistic missiles to our 656. The U.S. has 550 B-52s to
the Soviet Union’s 200 long range bombers, but that lead in un-
impressive when the sophistication of today’s anti-aircraft defense
system is considered, not to mention the continuing phase-out of
the B.52. It should also be noted that the Soviet “warheads are
generally far more powerful than the American.

; Some contend that such figures of relative strength mean little,
since both sides have sufficient megatonnage to more than destroy
each other and a good deal of the rest of the world. What they
don’t consider is that if one nation had adequate anti-missile de-
fenses, and the other didn’t, most of the latters weapons would be
decimated by an enemy strike, and most of what did get off the
ground would be stopped by the enemy’s defenses. American scien-
tists may question the value of the ABM, but the Soviets have been
deploying them for several years.

Many people consider nuclear war too horrible to contemplate,
but the horror of nuclear war is the very reason why it’s impor-
tant to consider whether our defenses are adequate to discourage
an enemy thought of attack. The kind of thinking that goes, ‘I’m
against the war in Vietnam. The military is fighting the war in

Vietnam. Therefore, I’m against the military,” is both irrational
and dangerous.

The basic purpose of the military is to defend the country. That
need existed before Vietnam and it will exist after Vietnam, and
it’s a need that should remain among the nation’s highest prior-
ities, if the country is to survive. "

As House Speaker John McCormack put it, if there’s going to
be a mistake in military spending, better the mistake be on the
side of more defense, not less, than is necessary.

Pledge Contributions Sought

Senior Class Gift Drive Strives for $125,000

By LINDA ANNE CAPUTO

According to Jeff Sengstack, pres-
ident of the senior class, nearly
90% of the seniors contacted have
pledged contributions toward the
class gift.

Class representatives will solicit
members of the class to collect
money to be invested by the class
and then given to the University
at the tenth reunion.

According to Sengstack the class
is aiming for a total contribution
to the school of about $125,000.

The class president stressed that
the major problem with the drive
has been the failure of class rep-
resentatives to reach enough mem-
bers of the class. Of the 175 people

fore the class reunion to take an
informal poll of students to de-
termine what they feel the campus
needs at that time.

From the suggestions, the ex-
ecutive committee receives, four
or five alternatives will be given
the members of the class for their
decision.

. °
Appropriations
(Continued from Page 1)
funded directly by the University.
The Student Information Service
and the Photography Club are new
organizations this semester and the
funds they have requested will be

mainly used to buy equipment.

The Student Information Service
is utilizing its funds to install two
“hotline” phones and a private line
for placing outside calls, for in-
formation on drugs and birth con-
trol, for pregnancy test kits and
for general operating expenses. It
is also looking into the possibility
of offering no-interest loans to stu-
dents needing money in an em-
ergency.

The Men’s Intramurals organiza-
tion appealed their request from
last spring to obtain money for
trophies for the winners of the
various intramural sports. The
Waterpolo Club raised $200 of the
money they needed to operate this
year before appealing their budget
request.

Tristram, the Intercollegiate De-
bate Society and the Bison Pep
Band have re-organized since last
May and came before the appro-
priations committee for the first
time this fall

The Independent Men’s group was
formally funded by the Men’s Co-
ordinating Council. When this or-
ganization dissolved they gave $500
to the ABS to be used specifically
for the requests of independent
men. Although their request for
funds for the purpose of holding
a Christmas formal is against the
new guidelines, the committee de-
cided the special circumstance
warranted giving them the funds
this year.

Any money left over in an organ-
ization’s budget at the end of the
current fiscal year is automatically
returned to the ABS treasury to be
re-allocated for the next year.

Recess Motion

(Continued from Page 1)
such a change. A “rump session,”
which they say is developing dur-
ing the time period between the
Thanksgiving recess and finals,
should be eliminated, and a recess
earlier in the semester would be an
effective means of eliminating it.

Such a recess would balance the
spring break, which divides the
second semester more evenly.

This change would also be more
of a recess than a holiday. Aca-
demic activities on campus would
still be encouraged during that
week, and the campus facilities
would be kept open for use both by
the students and faculty if they
wished to use them

The resolution will be submitted
to the Faculty Committee on
Scheduling for their comments and
suggestions about the feasibility of
instituting such a plan. The Associa-
tion for Bucknell Students and the
Registrar will also receive a copy
of the resolution for their com-
ments.

Suggestions are to be reported
to the faculty so that action may
be taken on the resolution by

responsibilities would be “to pre-
pare and distribute a comprehen-
sive analysis of the University, at
the present time, as a functioning
ecological system.”

“This would entail,’ explained
Dr. Marchand, “considering the
University as an environment, a
natural lab in which the problems
of environment could be studied.”

In order to do this, arbitrary land
boundaries for the University would
be selected. Within this area, stud-
ies of such things as the water,
air, quantity of green space, and
biological productivity would be
made to determine what the Uni-
versity is as an ecological system
in 1970.

Dr. Marchand stressed the im-
portance of “‘a comprehensive an-
alysis of the University at the pres-
ent time” for two reasons. First,
such an analysis would provide a
basis for future periodical com-
parison, in regard to rate and de-
gree of change in the environment.
And an awareness of the environ-
ment’s present state is needed be-
fore concrete recommendations for
action can be made.

The committee would also be re-
sponsible for soliciting the co-op-
eration of all facets of the Univer-
sity community, academic and non-
academic, “in formulating environ-
mental objectives for the system.”

Dr. Marchand sees this as “a
unique possibility for a community
which is more highly educated,
aware, and smaller than the aver-
age community, to cope with en-
vironmental problems.”

Dr. Marchand is particularly in-
terested in the committee’s respon-
sibility “to encourage faculty and
student research in various aspects
of the system and to coordinate all
such efforts.”

“Using the University as a lab-
oratory provides numerous oppor-
tunities for research at all levels,”
he continued. He is hopeful that
such courses as economics and bus-
iness adminitration could introduce
such marketing problems as recyc-
ling paper, metal, and glass pro-
ducts in this area. He noted that
biology, geology, chemistry and ci-
vil engineering are of particular
relevance to studying the local sys-
tem. Another example given was
that of an ecological student who
could use the University as a base
for monitoring air, rather than a
problem from an isolated and sep-
arate area.

The committee would also co-op-
erate with the Institute for Region-
al Affairs. Dr. Marchand explained
that “this would provide us with a
means to publish our findings, to

tell the local community what we

re doing to solve our problems.”
“We would also,” he continued,
“promote local and regional en-
vironmental programs in conjunc-
tion with the Institute.”

Dr. Marchand has also proposed
“that the committee consist of 7
faculty members, 5 students, the
Director of the Institute of Regional
Affairs, and the Vice-President for
Business and Finance.”

He indicated that President
Charles H. Watts; Dr. Wendell L
Smith, Provost; and Mr. John Zel.
ler, vice-president for business and
finance, have expressed interest and
support for the general idea. He
is optimistic that such a commit-
tee will meet with university ap-
proval

When voting on the motion, the
faculty will also be considering Dr.
Marchand’s proposal “that this
committee be incorporated into the
University Senate Proposal as a
University committee by the facul-
ty-ABS Conference Committee.”

the AAUP statement but has not
formally adopted it.

The chapter feels that it would be
advantageous to formally adopt it
because it provides a guideline for
the professor to follow.

Currently there are two means of
evaluating a teacher; the “grape-
vine’ and recommendations from
department chairman.

If the 1940 statement were to be
adopted, there would be much more
concrete means of evaluation of a
professor for tenure and other pur-
poses.

The 1940 statement insures pro-
fessors of full freedom in the re-
search and publication of articles
as well as freedom in the class.
room to discuss his subject and
introduce controversial material if
it is in relation to his subject.

The guidelines go on to ask that
professors be free from censorship
by the institution but caution pro-
fessors that they must be careful
how they present their views and
explaining that they do not rep-
resent the University when they
speak publicly.

The proposal says that tenure
should be given after a probation-
ary period and should only be term-
inated ‘for adequate cause except
in the case of retirement for age, or
under extraordinary circumstances
because of financial exigencies.”

The statements asks that the
exact terms and conditions of the
appointment be known to both the
teacher and school.

Also included are suggestions for
the length of probation period
(seven years) along with proce-
edures if a professor leaves one in-
stitution for another, plus a pro-
vision that “notice should be given
at least one year prior to the ex-
piration of the probationary period
if the teacher is not to be continued
in service after the expiration of
that period.”

The guidelines also provide pro-
ceedures for appealing dismissals
to insure that faculty members are
heard.

Cap and Dagger’s Performance Opens Tonight

‘Serpent’ Offers Escape from Traditional Productions;
Stresses Individual Response and Emotional Reactions

By DAVID HAMMER
and JACKIE STUBBA

Tonight marks the premier per-
formance at this university of The
Serpent, an Open Theatre produc-
tion by Jean-Claude van Itallie.

Unlike the “traditional” play, The
Serpent is relatively experimental
in nature. Trevor Lewis its director,
remarked that, indeed, the produc-
tion “is certainly new. Most theatre-
goers here haven't been exposed to
this kind of dynamic, exciting
theatre.’ The experimental nature
of the play can be defined by major,
inherent differences within the pro-
duction which set it apart from
other dramatic undertakings.

One difference resides in audience
seating. An “environmental” arena-
type situation, created by platforms
and chairs, is constructed on stage
for the audience. The resulting,
close, proximity of the performers

Debate Society
Stages Revival

By KARL BLAKE

After remaining relatively dor-
mant for two years, the univers-
ity’s Intercollegiate Debating So-
ciety has revived, and is thriving.

In an invitational speech and de-
bate tournament held at Susque-
hanna University on November 7,
a four-man team, composed of
Michael Baron, Rich Kleinert, Betty
Willet and Steve Valenti, won the
first-place trophy in speech. St.
John’s University won the trophy
for debate.

Baron, Kleinert and Willet com-
peted in the category of Extem-
poraneous Speaking, and Valenti
was entered in the Original Ora-
tory category.

Forty-two schools from through-
out the Northeast participated in
the tournament, officially known as
the “Dutchman Forensic Classic’’
and the “Delta Sigma Rho-Tau
Kappa Alpha Forensic Tourna-
ment”

New Members

The society now has ten members
and is still seeking new members
who are interested either in debate
and speech, or in helping with re-
search and typing.

During the past two years, a
dearth of student interest caused
a sharp decline in the society’s
activity. Early this year, however,
freshman Steve Valenti and other
interested students contacted Dr.
Frank Merritt, who has been coach
of the debating society here for
over twenty years, and set about
reorganizing the moribund organi-
zation.

An ABS appropriation has en-
abled the group to join the Associa-
tion of Debating Societies of Pen-
nsylvania Colleges. During the
second semester, they will be par-
ticipating in several debate and
speech tournaments sponsored by
the association, as well as in other
tournaments (such as one which
wili be held during the first week
of February at St. John’s University
in Jamacia, N.Y.)

National Topic

The society’s present concern at
its weekly meetings, held Tuesday
evenings at 7 p.m. in 203 Vaughan
Lit., is preparation for these tour-
naments. At most of the meetings,
the participants will be concerned
with the topic chosen this year as
the official national debate topic:
“Should the United States establish
a system of compulsory wage-and-
price controls?”

Each participating team must
have prepared affirmative and neg-
ative cases on the issue.

Competitiveness

The advantages of formal debate
over the informal discussion of the
classroom, according to the re-
juvenated society’s principal organ-
izer, Steve Valenti, are “‘the op.
portunity to participate in a com-
petitive area other than athletics”
and the “‘intellectual discipline”
which comes from dealing with a
single topic in a systematic and
organized fashion. And, possibly be-
cause of these advantages, the De-
bating Society has, this year, shown
ample signs of life.

he will experience nothing like a
violent shock, but a quiet, moving
sort of thing.”

Lewis further explained that the

Obviousk7, with the closeness of the

rests upon a ‘“‘group of people who

And it is working together which
the cast experienced weeks before

improvised in order to ‘develop an

A ‘Hollywood’ Triumph

By DAN MARTIN

Airport is a difficult film to re-
view. As I look back upon it, I
cannot fail to notice its many w' ak-
nesses, including major failings
such as poor acting and weak plot
structure. Yet, neither can I deny
the fact that I enjoyed the film in
general, and that it held my in-
terest throughout.

The film is, at best, episodic
It presents to its audience the life-
stories of almost a dozen characters,
with the inevitable effect of an
overall sketchiness which fails to
develop all but one ‘or perhaps
two) of the cast members. ‘While
this technique was used quite ef-
fectively in the novel by Arthur
Haley, it leaves the movie-goer
with little more than a feeling of
emptiness or confusion.

Burt Lancaster is passable, but
far from excellent. The remainder
of the tudded cast is reduced
to nea nonymity, if only by vir-
tue of the uninspiring and minimal
parts awarded them.

With few exceptions, the big
names performing in small ‘roles,
coupled with the episodic tendency
of the film, add up to a melo-
dramatic presentation which is
saved only by a few good effects

Why, then, is Airpert worth -see-
ing? Perhaps many people will feel
that it is a total waste of their
time, but n still not disappointed
with t fact that I spent the
money to see it.

It may have been my mood on
the night I was at the theatre and
perha would have enjoyed any
film which had been projected on
the screen. Yet I feel that there
are some qualities of Airpert which
helped to counteract the failures
noted above and make it worth
my while

edly the funniest and most de-
lightful in the film, and the epi-
sodes in which she is involved are
a great help in keeping the action
alive.

Also maintaining the pace of the
film are several’ minor characters
such as the priest, whose small
pleasant roles are not intended to
expose the depths of their person-
alities.

Airport is also a generally ex-
citing account of an airplane dis-
aster, if only in the scenes directly
dealing with the craft itself. I had
the unmistakable impression that
the entire theater in which I saw
the film was apprehensive and e€x-
cited during the latter half of the
film as I.

If Airport is depressing on an in-
tellectual level, it at least partially
compensates in the emotional effect
it produces.

There is no doubt that Airport
could have been adapted a bit
better to the screen. Perhaps,
though, the faulty version which
is currently playing at The Campus,
has some merit, and those who have
missed and still enjoy a Hollywood
production will favor it still.

Conscientious Objection Gives

‘Airport’ Production Alternatives to Armed Services
Fails and Succeeds

By DEAN LANDEW

Features Editor’s Note: This is
the first of a two-part series on the
conscientious objector and the
draft.

Upon turning 18 years of age,
every male citizen of this country
is faced with the prospect of the
draft. Of the many different ways
a man can decide to deal with the
draft, possibly the least considered
and understood alternative is con-
scientious objection.

As late .as last spring, a con-
scientious objector, by law, was
“by the reason of religious train-
ing and belief, conscientiously op-
posed to participation in war in
any form.”

Formerly, “religious training and
belief” did not include ‘‘essentially
political, sociological, or philoso-
phical views, or a merely personal
moral code.”

Within the year, however, Curtis
Tarr, director of the Selevtive Ser-
vice System, has expanded these
qualifications to include moral or
philosophical beliefs.

Regardless of the new ruling, a
draft board is only in a position
to judge sincerity. Therefore, a co
claimant need not belong to an
established religion, although his
case then becomes decidedly harder
to prove.

As for established sects, Quakers
and Jehovah’s Witnesses are gen-
erally acknowledged to embrace
“peace” idedlogies as opposed to
Catholics, Protestants and Jews.

There are two types of COs. One
is completely exempt from service
in the military structure and is de-
ferred for two years of civilian
work ‘“‘contributing to the ainten-
ance of national health, safety, or
interest (I-O status).”

For example, this might entail
working in a hospital or teaching
in a ghetta school. The other type
of CO must serve in the military
but only in a noncombatant role
(-A-O). Currently, a number of
men who have attained this status
serve as medics in Vietnam.

The I-O status is possibly the

| more difficult one to attain. Many
} questions arise concerning the na-

ture of violence and self-defense,
and many draft boards ask ques-

| tions of historical or political na-
| ture designed to find fault in the

position of the CO claimant.

Even if the CO claimant con-
siders his draft board’s questions

| irrelev ant, he must be prepared to

give some sort of response to any
questions posed to him

For the men who may be con-
sidering the alternative of con-
scientious objection or who may be

| interested in knowing what this

position entails, the following ques-

| tions are often encountered. Each
| question is followed by an interpre-

tive response designed to orient
the potential CO.
+70: €

Do you object to all wars or only
to particular wars?

This question is posed in different
ways, most frequently as ‘‘Do you
believe there is such a thing as a
just war?” and “Are you a selec-
tive objector?”

The question is crucial because
the law states that the claimant
must object to participation in all
wars. (However, this issue will
probably come before the Supreme
Court in 1971 and may be over-
turned.)

Many young men are only selec-
tive objectors, specifically to the
Vietnam war. The many ramifica-
tions of a limited land war fought
on foreign soil for a cause not di-
rectly related to America’s national
security makes Vietnam a unique
war, is a sense, on which the CO
claimant must pass judgment.

Selective objectors typically state
that they see no justification to
fight in Vietnam but that they
would have fought for the Allied
cause in World War Il.

The true CO, however, might re-
solve the issue of a just war by
transcending the historical and po-
litical conditions imposed. In other
words, to many COs, any war
means mass, organized, premedi-
tated killing, and as such, is a total
affront to the higher concept of
Creation and human dignity.

Would you have fought Hitler?

This question might follow the
preceding one. A draft board could
easily conclude that had Hitler not
been fought off, the CO claimant
would quite possibly not even be
able to take a legal stance against
conscription.

Many COs consider this question
irrelevant and simply refuse to
answer it. Others state they might
have fought Hitler if they had been
of draft age in 1940, but that the
current circumstances surrounding
nuclear escalation have rendered
the possibility of another Hitler-
like threat obsolete.

Other COs combine these two
responses in hopes of presenting
the most unassailable argument.
They state that they can only re-
late to present circumstances and
could not state with absolute au-
thority whether they could justify
fighting Hitler.. As such they be-
lieve that their convictions in a
past or future time could be quite
different and that they can only
stand by what they currently be-
lieve, which would be a rejection
of all wars.

How would you account for the
many wars in Christias-Judao his-
tory?

This question implies what it is
often difficult to apply as a CO if
one does not belong to a religion

generally regarded as pacifistic.
However, the CO claimant, if he
is sincere, will probably be able to
cite numerous instances of “‘peace-
ful” ideology in the Christian-Judao
religions, further stating that he
embraces such examples as the
basis of his belief.

For instance, many people do not
know that David was not condoned
by God for slaying Goliath, and
was, in fact, denied access to
prayer

In what instances would you re-
sort to violence?

A CO just beginning to research
his position might immediately
answer, ‘‘None.” If so, draft boards
have a variety of questions which
tax the CO more specifically, such
as ‘What would you if there were
a sudden Communist invasion?” or
“What would you do if your mother
were being raped?”

Much like the World War II ques-
tion, a CO might claim that certain
unforeseeable circumstances would
have to surround a “sudden Com-
munist invasion.” Thus, a CO might
again deem such a question ir-
relevant, impossible to answer or
inconceivable at the present.

The issue of self-defense is of
utmost importance to the CO. Many
COs actually take a pragmatic
rather than an idealistic position
here. They claim not to be God-
like; instead, they admit their
human fallibility but state that a
spontaneous circumstance such as
that posed by a rapist or a homi-
cidal maniac could never be equat-
ed with the mass, organized, pre-
meditated violence of a war for a
particular cause

In other words, a CO could state
that he obviously regards his life
just as sacred as. that of anyone
else, and that he only desires to
avoid all circumstances where he
will be forced to kill or employ
violence, regardless of the cuase.

Of course, these questions and re-
sponses can only serve as a guide.
The CO position is entirely indivi-
dual, and no “formula” answers
really exist. The question of sin-
cerity of conviction and conscienct
is ultimately the most important
issue

Alexander Graham Bell was a call

for help when he spilled acid on

Schumacher’s Raiders

Grapplers Gird fo

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

Head wrestling coach Richard
Schumacher is looking forward to
his first season as a coach with
great anticipation.

He is overjoyed with the enthus-
iasm generated by this year’s
squad so far.

“We've been stressing condition-
ing in practice and I now feel we
can go for a full eight minute bout
with anybody. We’ve also been
working on the fundamentals and
this, coupled with the bread and
butter moves the boys have retain-
ed from high school should be our
squad’s strength.”

This year’s lineup is young and

relatively inexperienced but Coach |

Schumacher is confident that his
team will deliver.

A freshman, Tom Wason, will
lead off this year’s lineup at 118. |

Tom has no weight problems as he
doesn’t even weigh 118 soaking wet.
Schumacher terms Wason
“tremendous sleeper.”

Tom just keeps moving till the |
other guy drops dead and despite |

his lack of size and strength he
has a winning attitude.

ter a year’s layoff at 126.

ence should be extremely valuable |

team is Mark Ramage. At 134 this
junior is exceptionally powerful and
fast Schumacher feels that,
“Ramage has the potential to be

r Battle

undefeated in dual meets this
year.”

Ramage is an excellent offensive
wrestler and will provide many ex-
citing matches for Bison fans.

Following at 142 is junior Tom
Rivoire: Last year’s MAC champ at
150, Tom elected to move down a
weight class on his own for the
good of the team.

Coach Schumacher goes into su-
perlatives over Tom, “He’s the
hardest worker on the team. A
real blood and guts type of wrest-
ler, anyone who wrestles Tom will
know they were in a battle, and
have the scars to prove it.”

Sophomore Don ‘Stanley’ Dan-
ser will hold his own at 140. Don is
from Easton, Pa., and therefore
has one of the better wrestling
backgrounds on the team.

He’s the toughest on his feet and
possesses a superb sense of bal-
ance.

An unorthodox but strongly cap-
able grappler is a capsulated de-
scription of Soph Al Loesch at 158.

Evidence of how well Loesch can
do this year may be seen in the
East Stroudsburg Open where Al
pinned two opponents.

Jim Schultz is a go-getter, hard-
nosed sophomore wrestling at 167.
His size, strength, and polished
moves provide a favorable outlook
for the Bisons.

The only thing freshman George
Ballentine lacks at 177 is exper-

ience.

A sectional champ in last year’s
Pa. state tournament, Coach Schu-
macher feels that George should
come into his own by the end of
the season.

Anether freshman, Jack Sauer,
will hold down the 190 pound slot.

Jack came out late due to a
broken hand but should prove to be
a strong addition to the squad.

Sophomore Ed Jones and junior
Stan Durtan are late arrivals to
the team also because of football
and both will battle it out for the
heavyweight slot.

Jones finished second in the New
England prep school tournament 2
years ago while Durtan is “very
big, strong, and very quick.

The Bison backups are few in
number.

Senior Walt Molawka at 150 has
seen action on the varsity before

and will be pushing hard all season
for the top spot.

Freshmen out are Rick Hersey,
an inexperienced 118 pounder with
a lot of heart. Jim Northridge at
126 will definitely be in contention
for a varsity slot all season.

At 167 Bob Good is gaining much
valuable experience for the future.

The last time Bucknell has had a
winning on in wrestling was
about ten years ago

Coach Schumacher feels that a
big success of this year’s team will
depend on their mental prepar-
ation

General Electric is marketing a
14-horsepower rechargeable electric
tractor capable of speeds up to 7
miles an hour.

We think it’s a remarkable
innovation. But an electric car it’s not.
As a garden tractor for home
use, Elec-Trak@can take advantage of
characteristics that would be distinct

disadvantages in an electric car.

The availability of fuel is no
problem for Elec-Trak. It’s designed
for limited use near electrified
structures, making overnight
recharging possible.

Still, one might expect Elec-Trak
to be the forerunner of a pollution-
free automobile. Perhaps it is. But
there are many crucial problems left
to be solved.

The most important one, of
course, is the development of a
substantially better electric battery.
Any car built today would be severely
limited in range and performance,
and probably prohibitively expensive.

General Electric is making
progress on new batteries, but there’s
a long way yet to go.

We’ve experimented with zinc-
air batteries. Sodium-sulfur batteries.
Silver-zinc batteries. Lithium-
halogen batteries. And others. There
are problems with all of them.
Problems of life-span, cost,
practicality.

Despite the problems, General
Electric scientists and engineers are
working for the breakthrough that
will make electric cars possible.

Maybe the breakthrough is
closer than we think. But we'll

continue to work and leave the
predictions to someone else.

He feels the team does not have
sufficient defensive board strength
to run a consistent fast-break. ‘

Overall, the prospects of a win-
ning season are not outstanding.
But as the sophomores develop, BU
could surprise people.

Comment

America has long been touted as
the great melting pot of the world
Meaning supposedly that any type
of individual could find his nitch in
the social framework where one
could fulfill his needs and con-
tribute his talent for the general
good. This old theory is becoming
less and less true as the years go
by

A prime example can be found
here at BU

There is one group on campus
that has met with continued har-
rassment from all quarters. This
group is the ugly people.. We sup-
port this harrassment wholeheart-
edly because we fail to see what
the ugly people can do for us.

Furthermore we will go on record |

as supporting the elimination of all
ugly people from the student body.
There are several reasons for
this action. First of all BU’s reputa-
tion depends critically on the type
of student that she exports to the
real world. This means of course
that every ugly person that gradu-
ates under the aegis of the Orange
and Blue is a mark against the
school

Therefore if ugly people are not
admitted in the first place they
won’t be able to hurt their alma
mater into Merrill Lynch and say-
ing “Hi, I come from Bucknell.”’..

But ugly people can have a more
insidious way of damaging BU.
Imagine if you will, an ugly team

in the Intramural program. What
if they were to win the Pangburn
trophy? And if they were allowed
to play intramural sports like the
rest of us, why, they might want
to play intercollegiate sports —
football perhaps or even basketball
(which is worse because they aren’t
covered up in those skimpy cage
togs). Of course we wouldn’t be
able to stop them because if you
give them an inch they'll take a
mile. And the real trouble is the
fact that an ugly person can’t be
made beautiful like the rest of us
simply by cutting his hair.

ABS Aid Plan Proposes

$5 General

By JENNY CHEN

An ABS adopted scholarship plan
to provide for immediate aid
amounting to $14,500 within four
years is now being considered by
the Board of Trustees.

After discussion of three alter-
native plans and to either raise
the general fee or to have a general
fund raising drive, the ABS passed
an amendment on _ proportional
rates 14-7-1 before the plan passed
22-0.

According to the plan, which also
met approval with the Admissions
Committee, only $3625, one-quarter
of the total, would be given out in

first year. A second scholorship
would be added the second year,
reaching $14,500 in the fourth year,
thus providing for an immediate
scholarship plan

In the other two plans, it would
take about 18 years before the
“amount of $14,500 was reached.

Committee Abolishes
Experimental College

By JOANNE KOLLAR

Experimental College has been
cancelled for this year. Karl Fritz,
chairman of the Committee an Aca-
demic Innovations and a member
of the Experimental College offer-
ed two reasons for its demise.

First, a limited number of par-
ticipants made the feasibility of
operating the college questionable.
The lack of interest is attributed
to several causes. While many
people recognize the need for in-
novations in education, this need
has not been demonstrated to the
campus as a whole.

Fritz suggested that more ground-
work, including the study of other
€*perimental colleges, and more in-
tormation on the nature of the pro-
gram is needed to create an at-
mosphere conducive to participa-
tion.

The Sum Also Rises

Watts Unveils Tuition Hike

By PETER BALAKIAN

President Charles H. Watts II,
opened the Faculty Meeting yester-
day with a report on his recent
meeting with the Board of Trustees.
Watts stated that the primary issue
of importance was the problem of
politicalization within the Univers-
ity.

The Board of Trustees came to
a unanimous decision to open up
the University to all outside speak-
ers. This question was brought up
primarily because of the previous
controversies including Rennie
Davis and William Kuntzler.

Watts continued with a report on
the financial status of the Uni-
versity. Unfortunately the Uni-
versity will have to cut back its
funds again this year.

He said that the budget would
have to be reduced during the com-
ing year as much as $175,000

Watts stated that ‘these are
perilous times for Universities
throughout the country.”

He then added regretfully that
tuition would have to be raised
$300 for the coming year of 1971-72.
This will then hike the total tuition
to a sum of $3,650 per year.

Yet, Watts remarked that this is
still lower than the median tuition
for today’s American Universities

Watts also denied any rumors
that he might be in contention for
the post of President of Harvard
University next year. An article in
the New York Times two weeks ago
listed his name as a possible can-
didate for the job.

Arrested After Thursday ‘Scare’
‘Bomb Threat’ Suspect Arraigned

By ERIC RIESS

A University sophomore, Robert
Lane will be arraigned in Union
County courthouse this week, on
charges of giving false informa-
tion concerning bombs.

A warrant was issued Friday for
the arrest of the Montclair New
Jersey resident, following the sec-
ond bomb threat of the week,
phoned into the University’s phys-
ica! plant

The charge against Lane is a
misdemeanor with a maximum sen-
tence of $1000 or one year in prison
or both

Dean of Student Affairs John
Dunlop said yesterday, ‘“‘The Uni-
versity will not take any formal
action until the civil authorities
have completed their investigation
and their proceedings are com-
pleted. At that time the University
will initiate their own investigation
through the offices of the dean of
men.”

The bomb threat which Lane is
accused of making was called into
the power plant at approximately
midnight Thursday

Through special arrangements
made with the Buffalo Valley Tele-
phone Company the call was traced
to a phone in Swartz Hall.

Dunlop noted, ‘Thursday after-
noon we completed arrangements
with the telephone company, as a
result of the bomb threat Tuesday
night. But I want to emphasize that
the phone was not tapped in any

topic for a television show taped
‘Whursday.

The show is part of the series
“Dialogue” presented each week
by Station WNEP TV, Wilkes-Barre-
Scranton. The station thus provides
students within its viewing area
with an opportunity to.discuss and
air their views on topics of in-
terest to the world community and
themselves.

Those students involved were
Geoff Blood, Nicki Drew, Glenn
Kidder, and Ann Saris.

In their efforts to find a topic,
the four had listened to the speech

recently biven by Reverend William
Cunningham, S.J.

As a result they planned to dis-
cuss the question of violence direct-
ed toward people as opposed to that
directed toward property.

The show’s moderator, provided
by WNEP, introduced the topic
with the statement issued by Presi-
dent Johnson when the Commission
on Crime and Violence was es-
tablished.

Rather than adhering to their
original question, the students dis-
cussed the general one of violence.

Geoff Blood noted that they did
not first define violence.

A major point covered in the dia-
logue concerned the legitimacy of

When the second bomb threat of
the week was received Thursday
night the campus security police
notified George Voynick, the head
resident in Swartz hall who evacu-
ated the building.

The state police were called by
Dunlop and arrived about 25 min-
utes later.

Together with the campus secur-
ity police the state detectives made

a complete search of the building.
At the same time the telephone
company was tracing the call that
been made to the power plant.
When the search had been com-

Zeller Announces $20,000 Loss
As Campus Robberies Increase

By RICK SCHILLER
and RICH DAY

Editor’s note: This is the first in
a two part series on theft on cam.
pus.

Lock your dorm rooms and make
sure your car doors are bolted.
The rash of robberies that have
hit the campus this semester has
certainly not subsided and indeed
appears to be increasing.

Although Mr. John Zeller, Vice
President of Business and Finance,
reported a loss of close to $20,000
for the school year 1969-1970, and
the projected figure for this se-
mester has already approached
that amount.

Although the normal student
“borrowing” of such items as sil-
verware from the cafeteria and
furniture from the lounges is not
the major factor increases, it too,
has reached an unacceptable level.

According to Walter Geiger, Di-
rector of the Physical Plant, over
two dozen sofas, chairs, tables and
lamps are unaccounted for. The
price of these items, which must
be replaced, is in the thousands of
dollars.

Both Geiger and Mabel Plue-
macher of the University Food
Service emphasized that, while
these items may eventually be re-
turned, they must be immediately
replaced, with the cost being shift-
ed to the students as a whole.
Another facet of this student
thievery which affectes the com-
cunity as a whole involves the Uni-
versity Bookstore. (The unusual ex-
tent to which this has been occur-
ing prompted a previous Bucknell

ian article.)

The most frightening aspect of
the thefts involves the loss of ex-
tensive amounts of electronic equip-
ment from all around the campus.
During the three days following the
Thanksgiving vacation, the Music
Department alone was robbed of
equipment valued at over $1000. In-
cluded in the robberies were 3 Dual
turntables and cartridges, 1 Fisher

Peacock Named
WVBU Director

The WVBU Board of Directors
elected junior Jim Peacock as Sta-
tion Manager last night. In a rare
case, Peacock will also remain F.
M. Program Director for another
year.

On the A.M. end, Dave McRae
was elected as program director

An amendment to the WVBU con-
stitution acknowledged the forma.
tion of a new position in conjunc-
tion with Music Director.

Freshman Jim Morrell was
elected as Music Director, while
Sue Fairclough, also a freshman,
will be Associate Music Director.

Other board members who were
re-elected are Dick Herring, Chief
Announcer; Kurt Gebauer, Public
Relations, and Nancy Godley, Of-
fice Manager.

New board members include Pro-
duction Manager, Gary Vanden.
broeck; Chief Engineer, Kevin Ku-
bista; News Director, Keith Cough-
ey; and Finance Manager Elaine
Wallos.

amplifier, 2 speakers and 4 sets of
headphones

The Athletic Department and the
Engineering Department have re
ported the loss of 5 electric type
writers and a ditto machine. This
equipment will cost over $2000 to
replace. Mr. Zeller, in referring to
this dent, brought up the pos
sibility of outsiders coming to the
campus in order to steal objects for
their resale value. The three color
TVs which have been stolen from
the residence halls are thought to
be included in this category.

Aside from the thefts from the
school itself, there appears to be
an increase in thefts of individual
people. Numerous robberies of tape
decks and FM radios from auto
mobiles parked in University lots
have been reported to Norman
Fine, Chief of Campus Security.

In addition to these, student
rooms and storage rooms in the
dormitories have been entered,
with electronic equipment being
the major objective. In one in.
cident over Thanksgiving, two
roommates in Swartz returned to
find two tape recorders, one tape
deck, a turntable, a headphone, one
Smith Corona typewriter, an AM-
FM radio and 26 reels of magnetic
tape missing. The total value ex
ceeded $1300 in this room alone.

The extent of the problem can
only be appreciated when you hear
the story of a girl who walked away
from a desk in the library and
came back 10 minutes later to find
her pocketbook rifled and $5.00
missing.

and what can the student do?

For a Fall Recess

Thanksgiving vacation should be
discontinued and be replaced by a fall re-

cess.

This schedule change has been pro-
posed by Professors Robert Beard and
James Heath, the Bucknellian supports
this attempt to orient an academic sche-

dule to academic concerns.

The October recess would evenly di-
vide the semester, thus eliminating the
present two week “rump session” in early
December. The fall break would be con-
sistent with the timing of the spring re-
cess, which falls in the middle of the

second semester.

The University does not make it a
point of celebrating any of the other
national holidays which fall within the
academic year — Labor Day, Veterans’

Day, or Memorial Day.

For most Americans, Thanksgiving
holds more importance than any of these,
but who is the University to make that

qualitative judgement?

The present policy towards indivi-
dual observances of holidays should be

applied to Thanksgiving. In a religious

context, many Jewish students make the
necessary arrangements in their courses
so that they may return home to ob-
serve the holy days in early fall.

Students wishing to observe Thanks-
giving should be afforded the opportun-
ity to do so, but their decision should
be a conscious one rather than the ha-
bitual one it is now.

We might look more closely at our

motives for celebrating this traditional

harvest feast. Some critics point out
that the historical roots of the holiday
lie in a developing concept of Indian ex-
ploitation. In the 1970‘s, one might also

consider the implications of an America

ness?

Letters Comment on Kunstler, J. Edgar Hoover and Hair Policy

Reply To YAF
To the Editor

On one hand, I am loath to con-
tinue my hassle with the Young
Americans for Freedom by taking
up space in The Bucknellian, yet
on the other hand, it seems as if
a dialogue such as ours might have
some value to the readers. And
maybe not. But here goes, anyway

First of all, the answer to my
letter states that since the author
of the article, and the source of
the artic were recognized, “all
other (sources) are inconsequen-
tial.”

It seems as if my Young Ameri-
can friends have forgotten that 1)
there were certain sentences in
the article which were highlighted,
and 2) someone had written across
the top of each of them “‘If you like
lynching you'll love Kunstler.” the
source of neither having been
identified

The latter was a personal slan-
der, true or not (although I am not
sure that a majority of pro-lynch-
ing Americans would find a great
deal of love in their hearts for
William Kunstler). This is at this
time, however, a point of argu-
ment, and nothing more, since the
writers have identified themselves

And if you sincerely hoped that
the members of the academic com-
munity would read the entire ar-
ticle, you would have simply posted
the article, unmolested by high-
lighting, and assume that those
who chose to read it would use
their intellectual, objectivity to ar-
rive at a conclusion without the
Young Americans for Freedom
making sure that certain phrases
stood out

If you truly believe that the

University atmosphere encourages

thoroughness and obje 4
in dealing with problems. . y
didn’t you simply distribute the
article and trust us to make in-
telligent judgements?

But what did Mr. Kunstler say?
I will be short, because we could
hassle this out forever. He was
simply saying, it seemed to me,
that the members of many groups
in our society, among them blacks,
are being, have been, left de-
fenseless against what should be
their first line of defense: law en-
forcement agencies and govern-
mental structures. He was not talk-
ing about the John Gleason case,
although he used it as an example.
Your letter, Young Americans,
states that ‘‘Shooting it out in the
streets is not the way to guaran-
tee the justice that the black (and
the white) community wants and
needs, and yet this is precisely
what Kunstler believes we should
be prepared to do whenever we
feel we have been severely wrong-
ed.”

Well, then, what is the way to
guarantee justice to not only the
blacks, but to people like the four
students killed at Kent State (shoot
out on the lawn - a bit one-sided?),
or the twenty-five arrested for caus-
ing the demonstration that so in-
convenienced the National Guard
that they bypassed the law, the
courts and the government and be-
came judge, jury and executioner?

How can we guarantee justice to
minority groups of all kinds?
Remember, you can’t use the
police, the courts or the legisla-
tures, because they’re full of Judge
J. J. Hoffmans, Ohio and Mississip-
pi National Guards, Ronald Regans,
Spiro Agnews, and the like. Time
and time again it has been shown
conclusively that there exists little
if any recourse in legitimate means
of securing justice for those of us
who are not white, clean-cut and
patriotic
How do we get justice?
Yours in more frustration
than hope,
Gary Koutnik

FBI Repression
Editor’s note: Dr. Ruether was
here for Colloquy this September.
She spoke on the topic, “The End
of the World and the Birth of the
Messiah: Christanity and the Coun-
ter Culture.”

To the Editor
n November 27, J. Edgar Ho-
Director of the Federal
1 of Investigation, testified
the Senate Appropriations
ittee that a ‘‘conspiracy of
Catholic nuns, priests and lay
people,” masterminded by Philip
and Daniel Berrigan, were planning
actions such as kidnapping govern-
ment officials and bombing power
facilities to the Capitol. Mr. Ho-
over’s testimony suggested that all
the persons associated with anti-war
draft actions were a single con-
atorial group, led by the Ber-
rigan brothers and all identified
with the group known as the ‘East
Coast Conspiracy to Save Lives.”

Those of us who know the ad hoc
and nonviolent character of the
Catholic resistence movement in
these areas feel that these charges
represent a very serious ascada-
tion of government repression of
dissent and political opposition.
Needless to say, the many people
associated with the various actions
are not a single group, are not led
by the Berrigan brothers in any
organizational sense and totally re-
ject the kind of actions which Mr.
Hoover describes. Such testimony
is an obvious effort to instill panic
in the main body of the citizens by
conjuring up an image of despera-
does who are planning to put to-
gether in one package all the
various tactics of third world re-
volutionaries in Cuba, Vietnam,
French Canada and Palestine

If the FBI can make such
charges without evidence, without
any actual crimes committde and
potentially bring down serious in-
dictments based solely on their
‘secret evidence’ of ‘conspiracies’
and ‘plots,’ no citizen is safe and
our civil rights will quickly dis-
appear.

We feel that it is time for the
broadest possible coalition of con-
cerned citizens in all walks of life,
but especially those connected with
the church, to register a very
strong protest in Washington
against such political and repres-
sive use of the legislative power of
the FBI, and to make a dramatic
manifestation of our repudiation of
terrorism both by the Left and by

the government. Finally we wish to
show our determination to work for
change through persuasion and
reasoned confrontation with the
issues. Nothing less than a trans-
formation of consciousness and a
rededication to constitutional ideals
and human values can save this
country from a very dangerous turn
toward total destruction of liberty
and hope both at home and around
the world.

We call on you to respond to this
and arouse your friends and col-
leagues to do likewise. As a service
of national rededication, we plan to
hold a 24-hour fast-vigil in front of
the Justice Department, December
18-19. We will assemble at a near-
by church (to be announced) at 4
p.m. Friday and march from there
in solemn procession to the Justice
Department where we will commis-
sion the fasters with laying of
hands. At 3 p.m. the following day
there will be a concluding celebra-
tion of the Eucharist, led by a
broad spectrum of church and civic
leaders. We call on you to come
and bring others to participate in
some or all of these events and to
join us in this rededication to solid-
arity, resistence to opression and
commitment to authentic social
values.

Hair Today. ..
To the Editor:

I would like to respond to Greg
Olsen’s long and involved Feed-
back of December 3. Because of
the length, it would be most time
consuming to refute his conten-
tions point by point. However, there
are several statements that were
made that bother me very much,

and I think deserve a little clarifi-
cation.

First of all, I think that I am in
a good position to discuss the sit-
uation described by Mr. Olsen be-
cause of my involvment with com-
petetive athletics on several levels,
over a dozen years, but particular-
ly because of my relationship with
the Bucknell basketball program
that has spanned 4 years, including
last year on the varsity.

There is a certain perspective
that can be gained only by being
directly involved and seeing the
various phenomena at work that
Mr. Olsen describes.

I think the best place to begin
is a recounting of exactly what the
Provost Wendell I. Smith said con-
cerning hair length. “If he (the
coach) could demonstrate that the
presence of a student whose hair
was the cause of a major problem
in the morale of the team, he
would be justified in dropping the
student from the team after he
had exhausted all reasonable al-
ternatives open to him to correct
the morale problem.”

Therefore Coach Smith apparent-
ly determined that a morale prob-
lem existed. How this was done
is of interest

First, let it be stated that the
student with long hair was told at
the beginning of try-outs (by Coach
Smith) that he would be allowed
to keep his hair for the duration of
the try-out period, and if he was
to ‘‘make” the team, he would then
have to trim his hair.

This agreement was violated
after two days of practice when
the Coach said, in effect, ‘‘Cut it,
or else.” The player chose the “or
else.” But perhaps even more im-
portant was the method used to
determine whether or not the hair
was creating ‘“‘a major problem in
the morale of the team.”

It seems that the team itself
should be the one’s to have some
say in the elements affecting their
own morale. In this case, no con-
tact between the coach and play-
ers was made, and in effect, the
Coach made an arbitrary decision.

Returning, to Mr. Olsen’s letter,
though, there seems to be a basic

fallacy in his reasoning process; I
grant that training habits (such as
diet, sleep, etc.) are very im-
portant sacrifices that the athlete
may have to make in order to per-
form well.

But there has been no proof that
the length of hair in any way
effects the performance of an ath.
lete; it doesn’t slow him up, in-
crease his weight or decrease his
stamina. Thus, hair cannot be held
responsible for bad physical per-
formance; what Mr. Olsen is deal-
ing with is a question of psycho-
logical effects and even such an
intangible as personal taste.

A second important point is
brought out in his discussion ‘‘of
rules and regulations’ and their
relationship to the team members.
“The rules and regulations pertain
to all members of the team, no ex-
ceptions made or else the coach
will lose the respect of the play-

ers

There have been numerous ex-
amples of violations of the above
by-all, but the most blatant and
most recent also involved hair
length on the varsity basketball’
team, the difference in this case
was that the athlete involved was
more important in the team’s plans
and the result was not that he was
suspended or cut, but rather was
given a talking to which in effect
said “think it over.”

A classic example of the double
standard.

Finally, perhaps the most out-
rageous statement of the whole
letter came toward the end -
“Some rules will undoubtably re-
strict the individual’s personal
rights but these regulations are
both nevessary and justifiable.” A
rule such as one regulating the
length of a player’s hair is neither
necessary nor justifiable. The de-
cision made by the Coach is an
arbitrary one, and the existence of
this “double standard” has been
a notorious characteristic of Coach
Smith's teams.

Exp. College

(Continued from Page 1)
mittee, which continued the plan
of the college from last January,
believes that a community college
is not wanted at this time. While
many students believe in the ideals
of such a program, they do not
have sufficient time or interest to
make it a practical reality.

Second, organizational details, in-
cluding the lack of a sponsor and
funding problems, hampered the
college’s plans. While professors
were interested in the college, par-
ticipants were unable to find a
sponsor because of the amount of
time such a committment would en-
tail. The University refused to
issue a waiver thatwould allow the
group to function without a spon-
sor.

Funding was also an issue. Last
year’s Experimental College was
financed by ABS funds. However,
no such help was offered this year,
and the University was unable to
supply aid. Fritz believes that
closer cooperation between the stu-
dents and the University adminis-
tration from the inception of the
Experimental College through its
actual realization is essential if it is
to become a viable educational op-
tion.

While the Experimental College
will not operate in January, the
Committee on Academic Innova-
tions will be continuing its study on
new directions in education, of
which a residential college is one
aspect. One possibility is the in-
corporation of such a college with-
in the regular structure of the Uni-
versity.

ABS Scholarship

(Continued from Page 1)
from the reserve should be used in-
sofar as is necessary and posible
to maintain the ABS cholarship
with its initial level with respect to
increases in the University fees,
further, the interest used in this
matter would be allocated to each
stipend in the proportion that each
stipend represents of the total
scholarship allocation; otherwise
the the interest or remainder of the
interest should be used to increase
the SFC endowment scholarship.”

A question was raised about
where the money should come
from, although it would not be ear-
marked for ABS scholarships. The
$5.00 would just be part of the
general fee.

An argument ensued in whether
it was necessary to add $5.00 to the
general fee which was rebutted
with, ‘“We’re asking them to go in-
to the hole more if we just ask for
$5.00 out of the general fee,”’ said
Jack Hart junior class president.

However, Russ Pais sophomore
class president suggested, “If we
are going to provide cholarships by
the students for the students, it
is our responsibility. If we tack it on
to the general fee, it’s not really
from the students.”

The idea of a drive fund was
dropped with the premise that
there are too many drive funds in
operation already.

In other business, it was an-
nounced that the ABS will give
$400 to the Independent Men for
Christmas formals and that a Co-
operative Funding Committee needs
two members from ABS to the

Advisory Committee which will \
hear requests of groups who want |

to program activities.
The ABS conducted a Senate dis-
cussion meeting afterwards. Before

discussion began, David Wein-
berger, said, “The Senate docu-
ment seems watered down. If it
was good, it’s not any more. The
ABS is trying to revise it and try-
ing to make it stronger. I have a
small objection, the decision seems
that it must be a realistic view that
the faculty will accept.”

“The Senate needs some funda-
mental thinking, I’m not here to
propose an alternative Senate. I
don’t think anybody here can... .
and I don’t think that amending
and reworking of all the parts is
really creating anything new. This
is the last step, maybe the students
should take the initiative.”

However, in an answer to the
philosophical university concept,
Lou Bucceri, recording secretary,
said, ‘‘In any choice of governance
we pick, we are saying what the
university is.”

After fifty minutes of discussion,
the point was made that there could
not be compromises on opinions.
Also, a point was made that if the
22 additional amendments to be
discussed are not completed at to-
morrow night’s meeting, continua-
tion of discussion will last into next
February.

Students Discuss
Violence on TV

(Continued from Page 1)

violence as a means of alleviating
grievances. The students generally
agreed that violent means are not
justifiable. When asked if they be-
lieved whether there could be a
just war, they noted that war, as
violence, is not justifiable as a
means of obtaining any end, no
matter how divine.

Considered also was the question,
“Does violence in opposition to vio-
lence create more violence? Does
it perpetuate itself?’”’ The general
mood was that anything founded on
violence does indeed depend on vio-
lence for its perpetuation.

Geoff Blood cited an example,
“The American government was in-
stituted through violent means. No
matter how good and right the
ideals of our government are, it
necessarily depends on violence for
its continuation, both domestically
and abroad, i.e. the Defense De-
partment, CIA, and police forces.”

In regard to the issue of violence
directed toward people and that to-
ward property, they briefly men-
tioned that it became a question
of semantics involving two dif-
ferent things.

Geoff Blood noted that an impor-
tant point considered was the dif-
ference between nonviolent and
peaceful action. He and Glenn Kid-
der saw “nonviolence as too nega-
tive thing.”

“There should be a_ peaceful
orientation, rather than a nonvio-
lent or violent one, directing the in-
dividual. This is the only possible
means of eliminating violence in
any form, ie. violent thoughts and
words, in the world today,”’ Blood
continued.

In discussing the point, the stu-
dents explained that “If someone
wants to change or do something
immediately, violence is probably
his only means. By doing so, how-
ever, a just cause necessarily be-
comes an unjust one.”

Once again Blood stressed that ‘“‘a
patience, a true devotion and belief
in peaceful rather than violent or

nonviolent change through the in-

Hoopsters Conquer Rider;

Biko Leads Bison Offense

By ALAN GROCHAL
Clutch foul shooting and agres-
sive defense highlighted a 75-65
Bison victory over Rider in the
Herd’s first MAC league game,
last Saturday
“Team pride was the major rea-
son we were able to comeback
after the humiliating loss to Penn
State earlier in the week,’”’ com-
mented Coach Don Smith.
The game began as a seesaw

battle, but the cagers were able
to open a 14 point halftime bulge,
40-26.

Early in the second half, the
Bisons stretched the lead to 16,
but Rider refused to quit. A scor-
ing spree, led by juniors Steve
Jefferson and Barry Spears, knott-
ed the score at 57-57 with a little
over eight minutes remaining.

Dave Greenwood put the Bisons
back in front with 2 jump shots

Tankmen Clash in Intrasquad

Peter O’Keefe starred in the an-

victory in two events.

The orange team was led by
junior Peter O’Keeffe, who swam
to easy victories in the 200 and 500
freestyles, and anchored the free-
style relay.

Charlie Wilf won the 200 breast-
stroke, and Matt Slick the 200 I.M.

Jack Krohmer has been right
around 50.0 in the 100 free all year,
and averaged 50.5 for three of them
on Saturday.

Winings, Paul Landes, and Ron
Farr paced the blue team. Winn-
ings outdueled veteran Krohmer in
the 100 free. Landes touched out
Dute Otto in the 200 yard back-
stroke, and swam good legs on both
relays.

Farr won both diving events and
scored around 180 points on both
boards. Mike Huffman won the 1000
yd. free for the blue

This year the freshmen are al-
lowed to swim in all league meets,
including the MAC’s. The fresh-
men definitely made themselves
felt on Saturday. The fourteen
freshmen who swam helped con-
tribute to 41 of the meet’s 113
points.

Besides Winings, Gary Norton
won the 200 yd. butterfly, and Bob
Richards placed second in the 1
meter diving.

This weekend the team travels
to Colgate for their first dual meet
of the year. The Bisons may be a
little bit short on depth, but with
the freshmen swimming they have
no manpower shortage.

The team has veterans swimming
in just about every event. A big
plus this year will be the divers.
Ron Jenkins put four men on the
boards on Saturday, and all four
of them looked good

from the corner. The Herd never
relinquished this 61-57 lead.

Co-captain Bill Peterson scored
4 points, Paul Biko scored 8, and
the other co-captains, Chris Riley,
hit for 2, in the last five minutes,
to ice the Bisons’ first win of the
season.

Biko’s play was exceptionally
brilliant as he hit 6 straight free
throws and scored on a key steal.
His dribbling and passing against
the Rider press keyed the cagers’
offensive charge in the second half

Leading scorers for the Bisons
were Biko with 21, Greenwood with
19, and Harvey Carter with 13.

Coach Smith attributed the fine
win to “teamwork and hustle.” He
also cited the Herd’s ability to
capitalize on 41 and 1 foul shot
situations.

The Bison freshman squad began
the evening with an impressive 76-
56 win over Lock Haven State.
Utilizing a height advantage, the
Baby Bisons built up an 11 point
edge at halftime and emptied the
bench in the second half.

Leading frosh scorers were Hal
Thomas with 22, Paul Kerr who
added 16, and George Tillery with
12. The freshmen now boast a 2.0
record,

Rutgers Downs Matmen;
Grapplers to Meet F&M

By KEN DOAK

The Bison matmen gave Rutgers
a tremendous battle Saturday be-
fore bowing 20-14, a major improve-
ment over last year’s 39-5 trounc-
ing.

Before a_ large, enthusiastic
crowd, Coach Richard Schumacher
unveiled a young and _ talented
squad.

In the 118 pound weight class, °

the visitors’ Dennis Smith (10-1
last season) overwhelmed freshman
Rick Hersey 15-1. However, Hersey
fought off a late attempt for a pin.

In 126, BU’s Steve Coleman lost
a heartbreaking 10-9 decision, as
the Scarlet Knights’ Scott Myers
scored a 2-point predicament in the
final seconds.

But Mark Ramage (134) and Tom
Rivoire (142) gained hard-fought
decisions, 5-3 and 6-5 respectively,
to knot up the match at 6-6.

Don “‘Stanley’’ Danser then put
the Herd on top with a strong 5-1
win in the 150 pound slot.

Al Loesch (158), wrestling highly-
touted Terry Paquette, provided
the highlight of the match as he
dominated throughout.

With the crowd roaring and
Loesch leading 10-1, he finally
notched a well-earned pin at 7:23.

BU now enjoyed a 14-6 lead, but
was not to score a victory in the
upper weight classes.

Jim Schutz (167) dropped a tough
4-2 decision to Dan Brandenburg
when a late takedown attempt was
not allowed.

Rutgers’ Rich Rinehardt then put
a quick pin on freshman George

this season.

Ballentine (177) to even the match.

In 190, the Bisons’ Tom Connolly,
who has been out for the team only
a few days, battled back from
several near-pins with a tremend-
ous effort, but was outclassed 20-3.

Knight heavyweight Art Palem-
scar then wrapped it up by decision-
ing Ed Jones 6-1.

The Herd (1-1 on the season) will
attempt to ambush powerful F&M

Gulden Programs New Season;
Thinclads Enter in Invitationals

By JEFF QUINZER

Quickly now, what Bison team
will participate in sporting events
in such places as Madison Square
Garden and the Baltimore Civic
Center?

No, it won’t be listed in the Uni-
versity’s Winter Sports Schedule
or posted down at Davis Gym.
Hint: both the team and the coach
are in their first year here.

Given up?

The coach is Arthur Gulden and
the ‘new’ sport is winter track.

Coach Gulden comes to us from
Rutgers, where he coached both
indoor and outdoor track as well
as cross country. Here at B.U., he
coached the Bison harriers to a fine
season and will also coach outdoor
track in the spring in addition to
his winter duties.

The purpose of winter track is
actually twofold.

According to Coach Gulden, ‘‘the
main purpose is to prepare the
team for the outdoor season and
secondly, to compete individually

in the various indoor invitational
meets.”

In winter track, team scores are
not kept as they are in the spring
dual meets. The sprinters and re-
lay teams participate individually,
hoping for invitations to the east-
ern and national championships.

The team’s schedule looks like
this: the first invitational is the
Philadelphia Track Classic on Jan.
23 followed by the Cornell Invita-
tional (Jan. 30) and the Knights of
Columbus Invitational at Madison
Square Garden (Feb. 5).

Also scheduled for February is
a meet at the Baltimore Civiv Cen-
ter and the Delaware Invitational.

On March 5 and 6, the IC4A’s
will be held at Princeton and on the
13th there will be the East Strouds-
burg Invitational followed by pos-
sible invitations to the NCAA Na-
tionals.

At present, Coach Gulden does
not know exactly what boys will
make up the team but from what
he has seen “‘possibly a half dozen

C&D Version of ‘The Serpent’
Uses Non-verbal Communication

By HOWARD ASHMAN

The Serpent, as directed by
Trevor Lewis and performed by a
company of twenty in Coleman
Hall, is a rare and beautiful thing.
It is a theatre piece that sacri-
fices neither structure for freedom
of design and concept, text for
non-verbal communication, direc-
tor’s technique for actor’s soverign-

nor thought for intuition.

it revels in all these

things. Every one of them has its

moment, and all are fused into an

event that is present, intense, and
inescapable.

What is The Serpent? As con-
ceived by Joseph Chaikin and the
Open Theatre, and orchestrated
with words by Jean C.laude Van
Itallie, it is a ceremony that ex-
plores the crisis of twentieth cen-
tury man, particularly American
man in the sixties, by revealing
the roots of our crisis as they ap-
spear in the Book of Genesis.

The Serpent began in a loft in
New York, as the Open Theatre
troupe asked questions and put
them into theatrical form. As they
first produced it, the piece was a
personal statement. The problem
then for a different group deciding
to produce it three years later be-
comes unusual. How does one ren-
der someone else’s teribly personal
vision vitally alive onstage? This
university’s group chose a most
difficult and challenging way: to
make it their own.

They chose to re-evaluate the

words and structure from scratch,
to explore each image set forth in
the skeletel published version in
terms of their own bodies, minds,
and experience. There can be no
“success’ in this kind of undertak-
ing, for there is no ‘“‘goal’”’ in mind.

In other ABS business, a follow-
up proposal was made by Pamela
May, asking for a reconsideration
of the system of rotation for meals.

The recommendation which pass-
ed 13-5-2 reads “that the dining
committee reconsider a system of
rotation similar to those submitted
in September 1970 for students din-
ing among the three cafeterias to
be put into effect second semester
oi the ’70-'71 academic year. It is
felt that in this manner greater
contact among classes will result,
promoting University coherence.”

The original proposal suggested
that University Cafeteria become
the freshman dining hall, serving
540 students, with the remainder
of the freshman and all upperclass-
men down the hill eating in Wo-
men’s Cafeteria. Also, about 50
Swartz residents would eat down
the hill on a voluntary basis

Upperclassmen at Women’s
would be permanent, while the
freshmen would rotate between U.

No More Money Available for Security
Alleviation of Thievery Requires Student Cooperation

By RICK SCHILLER
and RICH DAY

The following is the second in a
two part series on theft on campus.

“Theft, on the average, makes up
90 per cent of all security problems
on most college campuses.”

This quote, taken from the “Dick-
insonian” (Dec. 14) characterizes
the problems the University has
recently encountered concerning
robbery and theft throughout the
campus. The specific details of
recent robberies were dealt with
in the last issue of The Bucknellian.

Here, the concern will be with
what the administration and stu-
dent body is doing and can do to
help curb crime on campus.

According to John Zeller, Vice
President of Business and Finance,
many problems exist in the ad-
ministration’s attempts to solve the
recent crimes.

First, due to financial difficulties
the size of the campus security
police force cannot be significantly
enlarged.

Secondly, due to student pressure
buildings must remain open until
late in the evening. ‘‘The students

want places to study,’’ said Mr.
Zeller, “but we cannot station
guards at every corner to insure
security.”

Furthermore, a tremendous bar-
rier lies within the students them-
selves. They leave cars unlocked,
dorm rooms open while unoccupied,
and valuables unattended, in and
away from their rooms.

“The students must become
aware; if any decline in robbery is
to be realized we need their help.”’

Zeller continued to emphasize the
role of the student body by saying
that ‘‘if strangers are in the dorms,
try to find out what they want. If
you see strange people leaving
rooms or buildings with goods try,
at least, to get the license number
of the car they leave in. And then
report the incident.”

The last statement is the most
crucial, for ‘‘students are not only
the target for weak individuals, but
also professional thieves.” If they
are to be apprehended the police
must be notified immediately.

Zeller also mentioned that loss
of duplicate keys apparently are
often used to gain entry to rooms
and buildings. Once again, stu-

dents, responsibilities lie in their
efforts to keep keys with them at
the same time refraining from
leaving keys on desk tops, bureaus,
on the top of door sills or “under
the mat.”

With respect to specific actions
taken by the school to prevent fu-
ture crimes, a large mirror was
recently installed at the bookstore
to facilitate security. Too, cafeteria
employees have been instructed to
watch for students walking away
with kitchenware.

Finally, the campus police are
being especially careful during
their patrols throughout, campus.
Together, a decrease in crime is
hoped to be seen.

Concluding his remarks, Mr. Zel-
ler made clear the fact that “the
school will prosecute students
caught stealing valuables.

“The students have asked us to
treat them like adults. We will.”
For goods of less valuable (e.g.
silverware) Zeller hoped that dis-
ciplinary action could remain with-
in the confines of the Discipline
Committee.

In addition, however, student pil-

fering has spread off campus. Ac

ng to Chief Hufnagle of the
Lewisburg Police, ‘the usual rist
in shoplifting seen at this time of
year has again evidenced itself ir
the local Lewisburg stores.’

Two University students have
been caught so far this year. Con
victed of summary offenses, they
have been sentenced to ‘‘cost plus
fine” i.e. the cost of the articles
taken (unless returnable) plus 2
fine of $25 - $100.

Chief Hufnagle said that the uni
versity is subsequently notified of
any prosecution against a student.
and the notification of parents is
then left to the student, or if he
refuses, to the administration

Next year, jwider aisles and
better facilities are hoped to al
leviate pilfering in the bookstore ix
the new student union. This re
mains though only one facet of =<

Thanksgiving
To the Editor:

In the Dec. 3rd issue of The
Bucknellian, there appeared an
article relating the proposal of an
Oct. recess which would replace
the present Thanksgiving vacation.
Although there appears to be aca-
demic advantages to such a recess,
I feel it is important to consider
the consequences of eliminating the
Thanksgiving vacation.

Since most Bucknell students
live a considerable distance from
Lewisburg, eliminating a Thanks-

giving vacation would be, in fact,
eliminating what I feel is one of
the most important aspects of
Thanksgiving day — the opportunity
to be present with one’s family and
in this spirit of love and com-
munity offer thanksgiving to Al-
mighty God.

This holiday is possibly the one
time every year when famalies,
due to a release from the schedules
of everyday life, can sit down at
mealtime and celebrate their
thanks together. It is the tradition-
al time of the year when older

In order for the University to maintain continued operations it is

providing the Administration with data about the interests, attitudes and

thoughts of its students. They can then try to tailor the various

Uni-

University was denied this information.

YAF Replies

To the editor:

We would like to take this op-
portunity to continue our dialogue
with Gary Koutnik concerning Wil-
liam Kunstler’s views of justice.
Since we do not wish the issue of
justice to be obscured by discuss-
ions of yellow hi-liters, we will re-
frain from pursuing that issue.

Let us then discuss the use of
force to settle disputes. In socie-
ties where the government does
not have an effective monopoly of
coercive force, disputes are settled
by private violence: blood feuds,
private armies, vigilante groups,
etc. In such situations, justice is
solely a matter of superior force.
If the ‘‘shoot-it-out’” philosophy
which Mr. Kunstler advocates (and
both Mr. Koutnik and we abhor)
were to prevail, our society would
be reduced in short order to a
savage jungle

Where government has an ef-
fective monopoly of force, this
danger is all but eliminated. Of
course, in its stead a new danger
arises: that government will mis-
use its power. This danger is very
real, and as was once said, the
price of liberty is eternal vigil-
ance.” But the solution is not a re-
turn to the ‘“‘war of all against all”
where every man is his own law;
it is rather a determined effort to
purge the system of its remaining
traces of oppression.

Mr. Koutnik states that “it has
been shown conclusively that there
exists little if any recourse in le-
gitimate means of securing justice
for those of us who are not white,
clean-cut and patriotic.” With all
due respect, this statement is not
beyond question. A few highly pub-
licized cases cannot be allowed to
obscure the daily workings of an
entire legal system. If particular
individuals are guilty of injustice,
let them be punished with the full
force of the law.

But let us not in our folly plunge
hell-bent into a world where white
and black rasists, leftist revolution-
aries, and rightist reactionaries go
about enforcing their political
views and social prejudices at gun-
point. The answer, however it may
strike some ears, is more law and
order — not less. Liberty and just-
ice are only possible in an ordered
society, as a study of any revolu-
tion or war (e.g., the Vietnam war)
will show. They may not obtain
even where order exists, but that
is a challenge to be taken up, not
an excuse for despairing inaction.

Yours in hope,
Bucknell 'Y.A.F.

Why A Senate?

To the Editor:

After two years of exhausting
debate on the University Senate, it
is my impression that most stu-
dents simply do not care. Why not?
Are they apathetic, dull, reaction-
ary? Or are there good reasons?

In a group united by its dedica-
tion to a common goal, the little
governance needed is supplied by
a simple, often informal structure.
It is only where interests diverge
that elaborate machinery is re-
quired to resolve disputes. This im-
plies that our own University “‘com-
munity’ is divided on that vener-
able issue of the proper role of the

FEEDBACK

To Jerry Norton, by way of the editor,

I feel it necessary to take issue (to put it mildly) with your column
“Right On” in the December 3rd issue of The Bucknellian. I am afraid
that people are so intent upon having the statistics that they never
bother to check their validity, and you heve provided them with some
particularly false ones. At least you might have disclosed your source.
Did you get the “facts” from Barry Goldwater, or maybe from that un-
biased source of good tidings, the YAF?

First, you should check the appropriate article in Scientific American,
January 1970. In fact, as of the writing of the article, the U.S. had 2144
bombers, to the Russian’s 600; 1054 (notice please, 10 times the figure,
you give) intercontinental ballistic missiles, to Russia’s 1350; and 656
submarine based missiles, to Russia’s 205. So if you wish to then throw
out the bombers the U.S. holds a 1710 to 1555 advantage.

And have you, Mr. Norton, any knowledge of MIRV’s? No, they are
not part of some fraternity initiation, they are Multiple Independently
Targeted Reentry Vehicles. With the use of MIRV’s every missile we have
can be equipped to handle more than one warhead (some up to 14! at
present). The article carefully points out that when we deploy MIRV’s,
which we are now doing, we will have by 1975, 5120 submarine and 3000
ICBM warheads aimed at our enemies. Do you care to add that up?
Russia too may decide to go ahead and deploy MIRV’s in which case by
1975 she will have 5695 total warheads deliverable. And on top of this
you can throw in, or out if you choose, our bombers, and our tactical
nuclear weapons that are scattered all around the Russian borders.

The figures are in the library for anyone honest enough to check. You
also might check the article in August 1969 Scientific American entitled
“Military Technology and National Security.” If you check the chart on
page 20 you will find the above figures substantiated and the source is
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Then take a look at the November 16, 1970 issue of The Nation. The
article is by Steve d’Arazien, a free-lance writer and says, in part, “For
several months now, the Navy has been quietly selling its little known,
multibillion-dollar ULMS project. ULM S stands for Undersea Long-
Range Missile System. . . Laird has spoken of ULMS being operative by
1978—if we start now. With this in mind, the Department of Defense has
given the Navy the go ahead to request $130 million, a threefold increase
of this year’s ULMS expenditure, when fiscal 1972 budgets are submitted
in January

The range of a Polaris missile is 2,300 to 2,600 miles (the exact figures
are classified); that of the ULMS missile will have a range of 6000 to 7000
miles. Instead of the sixteen missiles in Polaris, ULMS, according to one
expert, will carry twenty-four. Instead of being MIRVed to carry fourteen
warheads per missile, as in Poseidon, ULMS missiles may carry seven-
teen. If so, one sub could knock out between 300 and 400 enemy cities.”

So there we go again. This project is expected to cost at least $15
billion according to the project supporters, and around $25 billion accord-
ing to those who are used to the poor estimates of project costs lately
(C-5A transport, etc.). The estimate of our capabilities in 1975, according
to the article, is: “By 1975, barring an improbable agreement limiting
the already deployed multiple warheads, the thirty-one Poseidon and ten
Polaris boats will carry 7,424 warheads. Landbased missiles will be
MIRVed to carry 2000 warheads. (Some of these have been deployed.)
SAC B-52s and FB-111s will carry 2,160 warheads. Grand total, 11,584
warheads, excluding the tactical nuclear weapons. Thus by 1975 the
United States plans to have an overkill factor of twenty-eight.” y

The thing that irks me most is that this letter will perhaps make
it into the ‘Letters to the Editor” column and go unnoticed, while your
false statistics received much better notice. I hope some people take
time to check on such figures. I do not expect people to believe me, but

at least I include the sources so they can check for themselves.

However, the real point is that we will never solve our security
problems by spending on bigger and better systems of destruction. The
problem is political and we must not let the military run our decisions.
Unless we make significant attempts to deal with the causes of tension
in the world we will only prolong this wasteful spending. We are like the
doctor who pumps his patient full of pain killers but never thinks to try
to cure the illness. It is about time the world grew up; and let America
be one of thenations to try to cure the patient.

pursued in an autonomous institu-
tion. Today this rationale is chal-
lenged by those who would plunge
the University into politics (and
necessarily, vice versa).

In my opinion, this notion is un-
sound for three reasons. First, be-
cause it violates the integrity of
the individual in that a majority
of a group presumes to speak for
its members. This often involves
the re-allocation of resources due
the individual (i.e., class time, pro-
fessorial resources, etc.) for pur-
poses of which he may not have ap-
proved. In this regard it is often
urged that our “general” strike
last year violated no one’s rights
since individuals could still attend
classes (if no cancelled!) and pro-
fessors could still hold class. The
point missed here is that profes-
sors have no right to cancel their
classes for political reasons—the
student is paying tuition, not mak-
ing contributions to a_ political
cadre. Those students and faculty
who wish to be politically active
may do as “theatre people” do,
for instance, and devote their free
time to their interests.

Second, despite some stridently
voiced opinions, the truth is not
all that clear. My own convictions
have solidified somewhat of late,
but this was possible only after
quiet reflection — it was not a re-
sult of the partisan, polarized at-
mosphere of strike week. We shall
never solve our problems without
a realistic apprasial of where we
are, where we ought to be, and
how we can get there. Such things
cannot be decided by popular vote.
And now that eighteen year olds
can vote, the need for education
and reflection is even more cru-
cial: how many of us were as po-
litically aware at age eighteen as
we are (or should be) now?

Finally, the notion that universi-
ties can somehow descend onto the
political stage like a deus ex ma-
china to resolve man’s problems is
a myth. The sorry history of the
politicized Church and the politi-
cized University in other countries
tells us that when an institution as
a whole enters politics it becomes
corrupted and useless as a tool of
reform. I do not suggest that we
as individuals must remain aloof.
I merely urge that it cannot be the
purpose of the University to act
as a political party. The University
can and should equip its graduates
to challenge and change the unac-
ceptable conditions we find. To go
further is to destroy the best mir-
ror our society has—the only in-
stitution which train individuals to

make dispassionate, objective,
moral judgments. To the individual
I say ‘‘get involved.”’ To the Uni-
versity I say ‘keep out!”

I believe then that the Senate
controversy in many ways reduces
to a question of who will have the
power to determine the goals of
this institution. Those who wish to
plunge the University into politics
push for a single center of power
so that by a simple majority they
may convert Bucknell into a po-
litical weapon. That is the real
issue behind Senate—do we put all
our heads on one block to be chop-
ped off?

I do not believe. that my view
consigns the University to irrele-
vance. Nothing is more relevant
at this pass in human history than
knowledge. Consider the latest
cause celebre—ecology. Was en-
vironmental deterioration discover-
ed by popular vote? No, this was
the work of highly trained scien-
tists. Will the problem be solved
by good intentions and loud words?
Well, these may be necessary to
a degree, but unless coupled with
sound knowledge of economics,
politics, biology, industrial meth-
ods, etc. our good intentions may
only pave the road to a new hell.
If the University adheres to its
traditional way of life, it can per-
for an invaluable, irreplaceable
function. If it becomes a political
tool, it dissipates whatever value
it may have.

Already our commitment to
learning is under serious attack.
At present we spend only 28 weeks
out of the year (exclusive of finals)
in the pursuit of learning. One
hundred and forty days! And now
a proposal exists to shave a few
more days from the schedule with
a pre-election recess (again for
political activity. Do workers get
paid vacations to campaign?). The
pun is a sorry one, but if we use

our wits for only half a year, we
run the risk of becoming half-wits.
Let us be done with the Senate and
politicking and on with our proper
business—teaching and learning.
Sincerely,
William J. Mates '71

Concerts Coming
To the Editor:

I had hoped to have a few words
of Christmas cheer to give every-
one before the break about next
semester’s concert series (yes,
Virginia, there will be a series),
but I must confess that we are still
struggling through stacks of paper

bell, James Brown, Crosby, Stills
Nash and Young, Joe Cocker (no
announcement about any future
plans have been released), Bill
Cosby, Bob Dylan, The Doors, Fire-
sign Theatre (we have been nego-
tiating for over a year with this
act, but they will not do college
tours), Jackson Five, Led Zepplin,
Paul McCartney, Rolling Stones.
Simon and Garfunkel, Santana,
Elvis Presley, Three Dog Night,
Traffic (not coming to the U.S.
until June), James Taylor, and
Ringo Starr.

I am reluctant to mention who
we are trying to buy for next se-
mester simply because if we make

Quite briefly, this is the problem:
This is probably the worst buying
time ever for booking good talent
for a University. Festivals, concert
halls and stadiums have made col-
lege tours financially unnecessary
for most major artists. In fact, a
status symbol in the industry is too
be able to make the group’s asking

college tours; this is what the pre-
sent trend is with most of the well
known artists.

The conflict which we must try to
resolve therefore, is the fact that
the groups which are the most
popular, and are selling the most
records, are not available simply
because they are selling a lot of
records, and because they know
that they are the groups which the

any announcements before we have
signed contracts, then many people
will be unnecessairly dissappointed.
However, since so many people
have been inquiring about next se-
mester, there are two things which
I will say about our plans. First,
that I have spent the last three
months negotiating with the Grate-
ful Dead to see if there is any
possible way for them to appear
at our campus. We are still working
on a very difficult financial ar-
rangement, and I do not konw at
this time if it will materialize.
They are a very strange lot, but
they still remain as the most ver-
sitle and talented act in the country
are a very strange lot, but they
still remain as the most verstile
and talented live act in the country
today (minimum three hour con-
cert) so if it is at all possible, they
will be here. Now, that does not
mean they will be here, but it
means that we are trying. That is
the best we can do at this time.
And so folks, that’s where we now
stand. We are trying to sort out a
lot of the hype (maybe it’s a bless-
ing that a lot of the big record
acts don’t tour—most of them are
pathetic on stage without their
studio musicians and eight track
over dubbing tape recorders), and
find the real talent that lies under-
neath. We are also expanding our
view towards the new and exciting
art forms which are now becoming
available to colleges. We will not
compromise good talent just to buy

Help The POW’s
To the Editor:

Monday each student will receive
under his door a form letter to
send to Minister Xuan Thuy, chief
Hanoi negotiator in Paris, in be-
half of the American prisioners of
war held by North Vietnam. The
letter asks the following of Thuy’s
government: (1) that a list be
published informing the U.S. of
the names of all Americans being
held as prisoners of war (2) that
the humane treatment of all P.O.
W.s be assured (3) that inspection
of the P.O.W. facilities be allowed
This letter is not political by na-
ture, but rather humanitarian in
the consideration of basic human
rights.

This letter mailing effort is in
collaboration with the national cam
paign initiated by the National
League of Families of American
Prisoners and Missing in Southeast
Asia to deliver 100 tons of mail to
Xuan Thuy by Christmas.

The recent U.S. raid on the P.O.
W. camp at Sontay was the cul-
mination of much growing concern
over the plight of P.O.W.s. 339 to
500 Americans are being held cap-
tive by North Vietnam and some

400 others are listed as missing in
action. 2 of the P.O.W.s have been
gone for more than 6 years, and
some 300 more have been missing
or in captivity for over 4 years.

Hanoi, in violation of the Geneva
Convention, refuses to publish a list
of its P.O.W.s on the grounds that
they are not P.O.W.s in the Geneva
sense, but rather regards them as
“war criminals.” Not only does
Hanoi decline from publishing such
a list, but refuses as well to negoti-
ate for their release, permit neu-
trals to inspect the camps, or allow
the International Committee of the
Red Cross free access to the men.

The captors also control the cor-
respondence of the P.O.W.s with
their families and little communi-
cation has been allowed. Some
families or P.0.W.s have not
known for 3 or 4 years whether
son, husband, or father is still alive.

Please help the P.O.W.s and their

much truth that isn’t funny.

Draft Resister’s Options:
Prison Life or Canada

By DEAN LANDEW

Features Editor’s Note: This is
the second part of a two-part series
on the conscientious objector and
the draft.

The procedure for applying as a
conscientious objector can be
lengthy but is not particularly com-
plicatel. The CO claimant, however,
should be well aware of all the de-
tails involved.

It is most advantageous to apply
as a CO upon receiving Selective
Service System Form 100, the ini-
tial classification form. Waiting un-
til a later date may cause the
claimant’s board to question the
depth of his conviction and sin-
cerity.

One merely needs to sign his
name to Series VIII of this form,
which is a simple statement of re-
quest for SSS Form 150, the special
for for conscientious objectors.

The claimant will usually receive
this form within six weeks of his
request. He then has 30 days in
which to fill out the form, which
contains four questions regarding
the type of training the applicant
has had and the nature of his be-
lief, and return it to his draft board
(the letter may be postmarked as
late as the 30th day).

This deadline is important, as
the punctuality of the claimant
may be considered by his board as
evidence of his sincerity.

If the claimant is already de-
ferred, his Form 150 will not be
acted upon until his present defer-
ment expires, unless the daimant
specifically asks that his case be
considered. For example, a student
classification TI-S will not have his
CO claim acted upon until his other
deferment expires.

At any rate, a man who is on
record in the Selective Service
System can not be drafted until he
has exhausted all possibilities of
derefment. In other words, as long
as a an has signed Series VIII of
SSS Form 100, he can not be in-
ducted until his board has notified
him as to his classification in this
area

Personal Appearances

In all probability, the claimant
will have to appear before his local
board for a personal interview at
the board’s.convenience. The claim-
ant will be asked questions much
like the ones outlined in last
week’s article, and he should be
prepared to rise up to the most
hostile encounters

Personal interviews at local draft
boards across the country can be
arbitrary, antagonistic and unpre-
dictable; they can also be brief
and relatively liberal. In any case,
the CO claimant should be as artic-
ulate and calm as possible, and ob-
viously, well versed on his particu-
lar position.

The board will probably mail its
decision to the claimant within a
short time. If he is classified I-0,
the CO then submits his request
for a job for alternate civilian
service. Otherwise, the board will
offer three jobs.

If he is’ classified I-A-O (non-
combatant duty), the CO will be
informed at to the date of his in-
duction and then will probably be-
gin training as a medic.

If the claimant is denied either
of these classifications, he may
then request, in writing, a personal
appearance within 30 days of re-
ceiving his new classification,
which might be I-A. The CO claim-
ant should not ask for an appeal.

The claimant merely requests a
personal appearance and may state
what classification he feels he de-
serves. Then the edaimant should
submit by mail copies of any let-
ters and evidence that he feels
would and his case.

Board regulations do not allow a
claimant to be represented by a
lawyer at a personal appearance,
but a lawyer could certainly ac-
company a claimant as a witness.

Afterwards, it is wise to make
the most accurate transcript pos-
sible of the appearance, which will
probably be quite brief. The claim-
ant should then send a copy of this
to his board for his file. Such a
transcript could help the claimant
if a state appeal or court appear-
ance is necessary.

State Appeal
If the claimant is again turned

down, he has 30 days to request a
state appeal. Unlike the personal
appearance, the claimant does not
see his board or any other; only
his file will be considered by the
state board. The claimant, there-
fore, should add any new evidence
to his file by mail that may rein-
force his case.

The state board will mail its de-
cision and vote to the claimant. If
he is unanimously rejected, the
claimant can only ho pe to sway
his government appeal agent to ask
his state director to request the
state appeal board to reconsider
his case.

If there is a split vote, which is
rare, the claimant can then re-
quest within 30 days of his state
appeal result a Presidential ap-
peal. A three-man review panel
will consider the claimant’s file and
inform him of its decision.

Alternatives

If he is rejected, the CO claim-
ant’s options are four in number:
he may accept induction (highly
unlikely for a CO who reaches the
Presidential board); he may try to
delay induction in hopes of finding
new evidence which could reopen
his case at the local level; he may
take his case to court and try to
avoid jail; or he may leave the
country.

The last two alternatives are ones
of which all COs should be aware
Men who leaove the country or go
to jail fall into two categories: non-
cooperators, who refuse outright to
submit to the draft in any way, and
unsuccessful cooperators, who at-
tempt to “‘work within the system’”’
but are somehow denied a request-
ed deferment status.

Prison Life

There is currently a relatively
small but growing number of un-
successful cooperators in prison.
Some of these are unsuccessful CO
claimants.

The prison term for a man con-
victed of violating the Selective
Service Act of 1967 is five years.
Generally, however, most draft pro-
secution sentences last, an average
of three years, based on good be-
havior.

Prison life is decidedly regiment-
ed, but an unsuccessful CO who
faces this alternative can use this
period to his best advantage by
working internally for prison re-
form, organizing creative activities
for inmates, and assessing himself
personally

Unfortunately, prison life remains
quite structured, and prisoners
often face many restrictions in the
number of correspondences they
may maintain, the length of letters
and the number of letters they may
write per week, and the number of
visits from family, fiancees, and
business associates they may re-
ceive per month.

Off To Canada

Emigration offers a very differ-
ent alternative. Unsuccessful CO
claimants, whose beliefs are so
strong that they feel they can no
longer submit to the American
judicial process, may decide to go
to Canada.

This will probably mean that such
a person will never return to this
country, as he would face prosecu-
tion regardless of his age im-
mediately upon his return.

Although the Canadian govern-
ment does not offer official refuge
for American draft resisters of any
sort, an unsuccessful CO claimant
who decides to emigrate to Canada
can be admitted as a visitor, a
student, or a landed immigrant.

A visitor may stay for six
months; a student may stay for a
year at a time, dependent upon
the continuation of his studies; and
a landed immigrant may stay per-
manently and apply for citizenship
five years after his arrival.

The many ramifications of being
a conscientious objector have been
outlined in these two articles. Any
draftable male in this country may
apply for this status at any time
until his induction, but it is a posi-
tion which requires individual depth
of conviction and sincerity.

Detailed information on this sub-
ject can be obtained from the
Central Committee for Conscien-
tious Objectors, 2016 Walnut Street,
Philadelphia, Pa. 19103.

‘Serpent’ Stages Success

(Continued from Page 1)
that is so exciting.

In concrete terms, this means
that the director has structured the
piece as a series of tasks for the
actor: Become a fly, a crab, or a
heron and explore your body in this
new role. Become frames in a film
of the Kennedy slaying and play
yourselves back in reverse and at
different speeds. Perform the First
Murder. Dance. Search for a mate
among the universe of people sur-
rounding you. Grow old. Die. Find
a new life in singing the absurd
strains of “By The Light of The
Silvery Moon.”

Each time an actor performs
one of these tasks, it is a new ex-
perience. The intensity required to
fulfill each command becomes a
spark of energy that penetrates the
playing area and holds the audi-
ence spellbound.

Each transformation is a play in
itself, and the production’s only
flaw, if it can be called a flaw, is
that there are so many transfor-
mations in so many parts of the
playing area, often simultaneously,
that we could see the piece five
times and never see everything.
Finally, the audience is given more
than enough to do, to watch, and to
experience.

But as Trevor Lewis has fo rmed
it, this Serpent is more than a
series of actor’s exercises. He has
not sacraficed his own craft to the
actors’. For although he has seen
much of his job as giving the actors
a series of physical questions to
answer, he has arranged the ques-
tions in such a way that each has
a bearing on the text’s ultimate
search. As he puts it in his pro-
gram notes, ‘where are we at?
What are the boundaries we are
stuck at and how have they become
fixed?”

Lewis has used directorial tech-
nique to accent the textual struc-
ture. A taped heartbeat takes us to
the Garden of Eden and fore-
shadows the rhythm of a chant he
will give the chorus to sing as ac-
tors perform the sex-birth-death
ritual.

The ‘“‘warm-up” exercises sug-
gested in the printed version are
changed here to a kind of overture
in which we see the physical

energy and anarchy from which
the actors’ metaphors will emerge:
a free-for-all interupted with tab-
leaux that will take on a new mean-
ing as the piece unfolds.

Through a real understanding of
the kind of theatre in which he
has chosen~to work, Lewis has
avoided all of the pitfalls of the
medium. He has kept the text in-
tact and taught his actors to speak
it intelligently, intelligibly, and
powerfully. He has arranged them
physically into evocrative images:

a kaleidoscope, a serpent, a styl-

The real paradox and proof of his
art is that in this theatre which
comes from improvisation and free-
dom of idea and movement, Lewis
has allowed plenty of room for ex-
pression and none for anarchy.

James D. Lyons’ lighting not only
provides a strobe light timed to
the beat of a human heart, but

Features Editor Submits Some Specific ‘Parting Shots’

By DAVID HAMMER

Much too narrow a view of the
January Plan is taken when pre-
dictions are made of the program’s
shaky future.

Those who leave the university,
not embarking on an investigative
program of some sort, are accused
of taking advantage of the month
as another in a series of “never-
ending vacation’ periods; when
“only” 25% of the student popula-
tion remains on campus, critics

sense the imminent doom of the
Jan-Plan—and feel justified in do-
ing so.

Surely, there are some who
thankfully use the month for “vaca-
tion:” skiing, “relaxing” and, in
short, not working academically.
But there are others (and this
writer feels this group is in the
majority) who utilize the month
quite constructively — although not
signing up for an “official” Jan-
Plan project.

PREGNANT, NEED HELP?

For instance, the month of Jan-
uary offers individuals the oppor-
tunity to visit friends whom he,
ordinarily, rarely sees because of
distances between them; summer
jobs do not provide one much time
to take long trips visiting those who
are states or oceans away.

For those who have had an emo-
tional, disheartening semester, the
month can permit one to readjust
and re-think his personality and, in
a very real sense his “being,” by
allowing the individual to remove
himself from the university which
has held him for almost too long
a perio d.

Definitely, to those dismayed by
the “university experience’ after
a number of years, this effect of
removal can be quite welcome, and
should not be misunderstood or un-
derestimated.

In addition, such a “getting
away from it all’’ may enable one
to function much more effectively
in the second semester than he
could were he to return to the
university in early January.

Many obtain employment during
the Jan-Plan’s run: can this action
be justified? When one realizes that
$3700 a year is involved in remain-
ing, and that the students here
have only intellect and not income
in common, surely an affirmative
conclusion can be reached.

Finally, if January trips to for-
eign countries can be justified,
with little value extending beyond
their vacation aspects (and there
seem to be some programs exist-
ing like this), surely a visit home
and with friends may be in order
and, hopefully, not be denied.

Someone recently commented
that this paper’s editorial page, and
writings of other publications, too
often assert the presence of a “‘uni-
versity type’ here (an apathetic
person, etc.), and that such a mass-
categorization is as valid as Presi-
dent Nixon’s “silent majority”
grouping, and no more so.

This writer would remark that,
probably, categorizing one basic
“type” of persons here is some-
what naive and unnecessary; many
individuals exist at this university.

For example, there are many in-
dividuals who may be carictured
as, in a word, “phony’—in fact,
very many. Numbers of individuals
seem not to care about those
around them, and indicate such in
a great variety of ways.

This is a general comment, and
is meant for your general, honest,
thought.

Here is a poem for your contem-
plation, too — submitted by a
friend:

Why doesn't
General Electric sell new ideas
to the cities instead of

new gadgets to the suburbs?

“You shall above all things
be glad and young.
For if you’re young,
whatever life you wear
it will become you,
and if you are glad
whatever’s living will
yourself become.”
—e. e. cummings

One of the weekly events at this
university which may have escaped
notice through the years by some
individuals is the “Hilltop” film
series — one of the more interest-
ing, worthwhile programs offered
here.

By its own description, the ‘‘Hill-
top” film series is “intended to en-
hance the cultural life of the uni-
versity. The individual films are
chosen on the basis of aesthetic
and historic values, and the se-
quence of the films is customarily
designed to reveal the development
of directorial styles and film tech-
niques, thematic inter-relationships,
and historic patterns.”

This semester’s subject matter
for the series has ranged from
“War,” ‘Dada and Surrealism,”
“Current Experimental” & ‘Three
Films by Bunuel’’ to features on
“Black Comedy.”

Tonight, the last of this semes-
ter’s series, will highlight ‘Divorce
—Italian Style,” directed by Pietro
Germi in 1961, with a short flick en-
titled “Down These Mean Streets”
preceding it. If these are similar
in any manner to previous offer-
ings, the two are highly recom-

| mendable.

Anyone who has attended any (or

| all) of the series must surely have

sensed the quality of the selections,
and will join this writer in com-

| mending those responsible for the
| unique experience continuously of-

After thirty years or more of
neglect, there’s no question our cities
need help.

But what kind of help?

Will another thousand sanitation
men be the answer to dirty streets?

Will doubling the police force
finally bring crime under control?

Can new rent laws force
andlords to provide more low-
ncome housing?

All the old, obvious ideas have
been tried. What's needed are new
ideas and new technological
developments

General Electric has been
working on the problems of cities for

yer Of years now. And in that
‘ve come up with some
hink will help.

Garbage

General Electric research has
come up with what is probably the
most revolutionary idea in garbage
disposal in years. Our scientists are
working toward a process by whicha
special strain of bacteria converts
garbage into a high-protein food
for cattle

The process is still something of
a “laboratory trick,” but it could be
in the pilot-plant stage in as little
as three years.

Crime

You might not expect a company
like General Electric to be doing
anything about crime.

But the fact is, GE has been
working with the Syracuse police,
looking for anew approach to the
problem. Our scientists there came
up with a whole new conceptin
police organization called “Crime
Control Teams.”

In their first year, these teams
were credited with cutting crime
62% in one large, representative
neighborhood of Syracuse. And the
concept has since been adopted by a
number of other cities.

Housing

To meet the critical need for
new low-income housing, General
Electric is participating in the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development's Operation
Breakthrough.

While GE has no intention of
going into commercial home
building, we do hope to supply the
builder-developer with new products
needed to improve his efficiency.

We now have several design
prototypes of advanced, modular
homes that can be assembled in a
matter of hours.

These are just a few of the new
ideas General Electric has come up
with to help cities at the same time
that we continue to improve

GENERAL @ ELECTRIC

“gadgets” to help people.

We don’t think our home
products are at all unnecessary or
frivolous. If they seem that way, it’s
because people have forgotten how
much they rely on them. To wash
dishes. To wash clothes. To keep
warm. To keep cool. To entertain.
And on and on.

New ideas for the cities and
new “gadgets” for the home both
have the same end in mind, after all.
To help people live better.

Why are we running this ad?

We’re running this ad, and
others like it, to tell you the things
General Electric is doing to solve
the problems of man and his
environment today.

The problems concern us
because they concern you. We’rea

customers and employees.

But there’s another, more
important reason. These problems
will affect the future of this country

that future. As businessmen. And,
simply, as people.

F&M Decisions Grapplers;

By JIM NORTRIDGE

The Orange nad Blue grapplers
met the Franklin and Marshall Dip-
lomats on the battlefield of the
wrestling mat instead of at the con-
ference table and found themselves
losing the war 30-8.

But the Bisons did have winners
in individual battles in Mark Ram-
age and Ed Jones. Other Bucknell

season on the B team but an arm
injury to starter Tom Wason has
caused his quick promotion. Rick
has wrestled two experienced and
strong opponents in a row but in
each case he has come up with a
superlative effort.

George Ballentine had a tough
task in front of him at 177. He was
facing John Stevenson, an unbeaten
wrestler who placed second in the

Pluck the Eagles!

E.LW.A. last year, and first in the
East Stroudsburg open this year.
But the plucky freshman kept his
cool and drew first ‘blood as he
scored a takedown before his inex-
perience led to his downfall.

One other Bison who got caught
by an extremely tough wrestler
was senior Steve Coleman at 126.
Steve lad to face Chris Black, who
was also undefeated last year and

B

grapplers also directed strong cam-
paigns but they found themselves
outmanuvered.

Coach Shumacher felt that, “Fes
M is one of the toughest teams on
our schedule and facing them so |
early in the season was definitely
not to our advantage. I think if we |
had met them at the end of the
season we could have given them
a better run for their money.”

Sophomore Heavyweight salvaged
a disappointing night for the BU |
grapplers by pinning Len Rosset- |
tini with only 5 seconds left in the |
match, This was the climatic end-
ing of a bout in which both heavies |
almost came to blows.

Both wrestlers had picked up a |
point on escapes before “Big Ed” |
went to work. With a minute left |
Jones just missed two takedowns, |
being dragged out of pounds, before
he finally trapped his opponent and |
crushed him to the mat. |

Mark Ramage at 134 exhibited
fine poise as he cracked open his
match in the third period to bring |
home a 7-0 victory.

With a slim 1 point lead in the
third, Ramage escaped quickly on |
a standup and then took down his |
opponent with a beautiful barrel |
roll that completely dazed his op-
ponent. |

The Bisons really got hurt right
up the middle weight classes as |
Tom Rivoire, Don Danser, Al Loe-
sch, and Jim Shutz couldn’t cope
with the Diplomats and their strong |
arm tactics.

Coach Shumacher was especially
pleased with the efforts of sopho-

mare 190 pounder Tom Connolly
and freshman Rick Hersey and
George Ballentine at 118 and 177
respectively.

Tom Connolly has shown con-
tinued improvement and Shumach-
er feels that by the end of the
season he will be one of the best
190 pounders around. “Tom’s moves
are starting to come back as he
rounds into shape.”

Hersey at 118 started out the

Bisons Fall to Lehigh; Prep for DePauw

incredible 73-71 triple-overtime de-
cision to Lehigh last night, marring
their debut on the tube.

hero’s role for the Engineers as
he hit the last-second clincher.

Finally, one point—intercollegiate athletics exists for the players. It
is an activity which is not “professional’’ in scope, and it is supposed to
be fun. Truly, the purpose of a coach is to produce winning teams, but
not at the expense ofhis players—at least not at BU.

A coach should be the kind of person that his players can respect.
By the personal admission of former players, and even a few starters,

this simply isn’t the

asons, they simply did not want to play under the direction |

the Herd.

Lehigh passed the ball to Etra,
who missed a layup but Wisniewski
was there to bank it in just before
the final buzzer.

For the Bisons, Harvey Carter
played an outstanding game in de-
feat as he poured in 26 points, and
grabbed 15 rebounds.

In the freshman game, Lehigh
handed the Baby Bisons their first
defeat of the season, 69-68, despite
a second-half comeback by BU.

plagued by his painful shoulder in-
jury. He was not going to play ball
this year, but decided that, ‘he
wanted to give it another try.

Although he must be taped up
for the games and have continuous
treatmena, Paul remains hopeful
about his physical condition.

His play, though, has been even
more spectacular considering the
physical handicaps he has over-
come.

It is only with reluctance that
Paul looks back on the opening
game with Penn State. He explains,
“we just didn’t put it together; we

ay our type of ball.

We don’t have the physical size
to run and shoot with a lot of the
other teams. We must play for the
good percentage shot.” He feels
the Bisons should have beaten
State and wishes they had an-
other chance to prove it

The game against Rider was an-
other story. “‘We moved the ball
for good shots and we played to-
gether, like we didn’t against Penn
State.” Biko thir Coach Smith’s
strat of pl. for the open
shot worked re well in the first
half, but that they got perhaps a
bit complacent in the second half.
He sighted the leadership and ex-
perience of co-captains Chris Riley
and Bill Peterson as helping the
Blue to hold off the Rider come-
back.

Biko believes that everyone has
to set a goal for himself. His is to
have “the best record BU has ever
had and perhaps to go to the NIT’s
at the MAC champs.”

Although Paul admits this may
seem like a long step, he notes that
Rider was rated as a top contender
for the MAC crown before being
manhandled by the Bisons.

The Bisons have “‘a long way to
go to reach their peak.” Yet while
inexperienced, they are hustling
and Biko feels this is an advantage
as opposed to having an older team
that has already “‘peaked”’ and has
little incentive to work

The very fact that the team is
labled inexperienced often “gets
the team riled up, especially the
sophomores.”

While the Bison’s 1970-71 sche-
dule includes many larger schools,

As this semester shrinks away it marks the end of my tenure a8
Sports Editor of this noble publication.

As the awesome responsibility of my burden passes on to other
shoulders, I wearily think back on the events of my regime.

I see an MAC Championship for last spring’s netmen not to mention
impressive and rewarding seasons by Bison laxmen, cindermen, diamond-
men, and linksmen. The other teams over whose progress I presided were

cagers, mermen, and grapplers.

Following the Heard is an entertaining and frequently hazardous oc-
cupation. One of the most frustrating experiences was trying to get a
picture of Jamey Wherry’s record breaking bucket.

He adamantly refused to shatter the mark at the convenience of
Bucknellian photographers while in the friendly confines of Davis Gym.

Paul Biko: Backcourt Ace

Herd will still be a team to reckon
with as they gain experience.

But he is concerned with just the
next game - ‘‘We have to play them
one at a time and keep prepared.
As a young team we must play
patient, disciplined offense with
lots of basketball sense. This will
come if Coach Smith and the Co-
captains can continue to keep the
team up and the guys hustling.”

When not on the court, Paul
serves as Rush chairman at Phi
Kappa Psi. He is studying under
BU’s Five Year Engineering and
Arts Program (a Junior).

He considers this a smart pro-
gram for today’s demands, but con-
fesses that “hoops” is the main
thing on his mind right now

However the Five Year Program
coupled with Paul’s absence from
the squad la st season will extend
his eligibility another year.

One of the biggest gains Paul
sees in BU’s basketball is the fan
support. He was enthused by the
spirit at the Rider game and ex-

the expectation that

etball will grow as a sport at

BU as the team proves it capabili-
ties this year.

The key word to Paul is TEAM
He believes that every man must
put out for the team. “There is no
letter ‘I’ in the word team, every-
one must hustle before anything
goes right - all five members on
the court!”

This team play is what Paul feels
will carry the Bisons to new heights
this season and in the years to
come

Certainly if the team plays with
Paul Biko’s determination and team
spirit the Bisons will go far toward
reaching Paul’s goals this year.

However with 23 points left to
break the record the Bisons went
to Penn State where Wherry usual-
ly scores a ton. So, in a bald-tired
VW, in a howling blizzard over icy
roads, we carrended toward Penn
State, suffering along the way two
360 degree spinouts (both incon-
veniently close to other travellers.

Much to my cagrin after the har-
rowing trip, Jamey Wherry almost
petulantly missed several oppor-
tunities to break the record and
scored 22 points

Another situation that has oc-
cured repeatedly is the embarass-
ing event of having a gloveman
step on your foot instead of the
plate while being mobbed by the
crowd after hitting a game winn-
ing home run. (A good reportor will
go to any length to get a story.)

The close contact with the jocks
over this past period has had its
deleterious effects as well. I still
wake up after a Mittyesque dream
in a cold sweat.

These fantasies frequently in-
volve running 96 yards with a foot-
ball only to be crushed by a 896 Ib
defensive end.

I would like to acknowledge the
aid I have received in my endea-
vors to report the activities of the
Herd.

Dave Wohlheuter, the diminua-
tive Sports Information director of
the University, who provided me
with links to the outside world.

Brad Tufts, golf coach and ad-
visor to The Bucknellian, for his
rasping assistance.

Eric Riess the Managing Editor
of the journal , invariably did the
opposite of what I asked him, with
the express purpose of making my
life as miserable as possible.

Farewell and Merry Christmas
to all.

Faculty Descriptions Help
Student Course Selection

By SUSAN PRESTON

The Association of Bucknell Stu-
dents passed a resolution regard-
ing the publication of a more com-
prehensive course guide to aid stu-
dents in choosing courses during
pre-registration at its first meeting
of the semester.

The motion, submitted by Chuck
Mussman ” endorsed a plan
which Leon Pacala, dean of the
college of arts and sciences, will
implement later this month. He will
send a letter to all department
chairmen and professors asking
them to prepare a description of
the courses offered by their de-
partment, following certain guide-
lines.

The descriptions will then
compiled into one book and di
buted to students before spring pre-
registration. Some of the guidelines
include course objectives, methods
of approach, prerequisites, expendi-
tures excluding books), how the
students will be evaluated and what
semesters the course will be of-
fered.

AWS Organization
Feresees Transition

By GINA SMITH

Acting on the results of a refer-
endum among women, the Associa-
tion of Women Students has es-
tablished an ad hoc committee to
propose a new women’s orgamniza-
tion.

AWS president Stuie Oliver ex-
plains, “The women’s organization
will be totally revised to fit new
needs.” Both the questionaire re-
sults and committee decisions will
determine the exact nature of the
new organization.

The new committee’s data in-
cludes the results of the December
poll in which 594 out of nearly one
thousand women participated. A
majority, 66.4% of women voting,
favored the continuation of an
organization to serve the needs of
Bucknell women. The other 33.6%
indicated a desire for no such
organization.

AWS will continue to function
until the new constitution has been
formulated. However, many AWS
members have been incorporated
into the committee. The annual
February election of officers will
not be held.

Miss Oliver is confident that the
constitution will be completed this
semester. She notes, however, that
AWS still exists technically; the
December questionaire contained
no formal proposal for abolishing
AWS.

Other new business of the meet-
ing, included the presentation of
Bob Nachshin’s motion regarding
the abolition of visitation hours in
residence halls. The motion will be
voted upon next week

Peter Holmes, -at-large member,
presented a motion regarding the
formation of a committee to in-
vestigate and recommend changes
in the University Counseling Ser-
vice. The motion was passed.

The ABS decided to table its mo-
tion to the University Dining Com-

Professor Emeritus Dies at Geisinger;
Two Crashes Kill Runners, Freshman

By JOANNE KOLLAR and
NICKI DREW
Dr. Rice

Dr. John W. Rice, professor of
bacteriology emeritus, died Friday
at 8:00 pm. in Geisinger Medical
Center where he had been admitted
that afternoon. He was 79 years
old.

Dr. Rice lived at 610 St. George
Street, Lewisburg.

Since 1946, he had served as di-
rector of the University Health
Service, which he founded in 1925.
Dr. Rice was consulting bacteri-
ologist for the Geisinger Medical
Center.

A graduate of Williamsport High
School, Dr. Rice received a Bache-
lor of Science degree from the Uni-
versity in 1914 and his Master of
Science degree in 1915. In 1918, he
obtained a Master of Arts from
Columbia University and his Ph.D.
in 1922.

As an instructor in physics at the
old Bucknell Academy, Dr. Rice
began his 45 year teaching career:
From 1939 until 1942 and again from
1944 until 1958, he was chairman of
the biology department.

He authored numerous articles in
his field, and in 1952 published a
history of the teaching of biology
at the University. L’Agenda was
dedicated to him in 1945.

A former University professor,
Miss Amelia Clark, who was an
assistant professor of French and
Dean of Women from 1924 until
1936, also died. Miss Clark, who was
in a nursing home in St. Peters-
burg, Florida, was 84.

Three Students

Three University students were
killed in automobile accidents over
the January break.

The first one occurred on Satur-

day, January 16, at around five
o'clock p.m. on route 22, near
Greensburg, Pa., when three mem-
bers of the track team were re-
turning to school from a meet in
Pittsburgh. The remainder of the
team was on a University-owned
bus.

The car, driven by junior John
Lanphear, of Clifton, N.J., skidded
on ice and hit a truck head-on. Fred

Weber, a sophomore from West-
mont, NJ. and the holder of
several university track records,
was dead on arrival at Westmore-
land County Hospital, and Peter
Younger, a sophomore from Satel-
lite Beach, Fla., died shortly after
midnight

‘Conspirators’’ Support Grows;
Harrisburg Workshop Planned

By JACK SCHMIDT

Campus reaction to the Harris-
burg Six grand jury proceedings
has been generally passive, but
active support of the alleged con-
spirators is growing

Tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m.,
a group will be leaving from in
front of New Dorm for an all-day
workshop at Harrisburg Community
College. The meetings are designed
to educate people to the issues at
stake in the case, and the work-
shop is being held under the theme
of “A Time to Learn, Discuss, Ex-
plore, Question, Think, and Con-
spire.”

Various topics will be discussed
ranging from the non-violent tac-
tics of confrontation, to the Black
liberation movement and the role
of women in our society.

Transportation is needed by the
group and anyone able to supply a
car has been asked to do so.

In other related activities, a
motion is expected to be presented
at Monday’s upcoming faculty
meeting which will reaffirm the
university’s right to remain free
from government interference.

The AAUP is in the process of
organizing a campus workshop to
J ss the issues of the trial. The

op is planned for Monday.

Earlier this week, an ad hoc
group calling itself the “Bucknell
Students for Peace” distributed a
statement entitled, ‘Bucknell In-
volvement in a ‘Berrigan Conspir-
acy’.” Written by Eric LeRoy, a
freshman, the statement sought to
briefly inform registering students
to some of the facts of the case.
It said, “Bucknell has been very
much involved in the government’s
hunting expedition.”

On Wednesday night, February
3, “The Holy Outlaw,” was shown
documenting the fugitive life of
Dan Berrigan. Contributions were
taken for the Harrisburg defense
fund.

A mass student group has yet to
be organized on campus, and there
is uncertainty among those already
involved as to the future course of
supporting activities. The trial is
many months away, and the govern-
ment’s case is still unclear. As one
concerned student said, ‘“‘Every-
thing is still up in the air.”

Harrisburg Six Trial Intrigues Campus

By PHILIP WITHIM
(Editor’s note) The following summary of events relating to the
Federal Grand Jury investigation and indictment of the Harrisburg Six
was compiled by Dr. Withim with the assistance of other members of
the University community. The information was drawn from newspaper

at several court proceedings.

Federal Penitentiary.
This is the first of two parts.

the government names as CO-Con-
spirators Rev. Daniel Berrigan, Thomas Davidson,

Sister Marjorie Shu-

man, Sister Beverly Bell, Paul Mayer (former priest), William Davidon,

and Sister Joques Egan.

The indictment charges that all thirteen “conspired and agreed to-

maps and diagrams of the underground tunnels in Washington D.C., con-

taining the heating systems for government buildings . . .

. to destroy heating pipes. It was part of the con-

spiracy that on the following day they would seize, kidnap . . - Henry

Kissinger.”

The indictment then lists twenty-two

“overt acts” committed “in

furtherance of the conspiracy.” For evample, that on April 1, 1970, Philip
Berrigan and Joseph Wenderoth entered underground tunnels in Wash-
ington, D.C., that on June 19, Neil McLaughlin made a telephone call to

Lewisburg, that on June 22

Joseph Wenderoth and Neil McLaughlin

made a visit to Lewisburg, that on September 5, Wenderoth and Mc-
Laughlin met at 43 North Water Street - the home of Mrs. Horn.

In addition, the indictment

lists six occasions when Sr. Elizabeth

McAlister and Fr. Philip Berrigan attempted to pass communications in
or out of the federal prison at Lewisburg.
The indictment speaks of conspiring to own explosives, of conspir-

ing to blow up tunnels,

of conspiring to kidnap Kissinger. The charges

concern these conspiracies and not the execution of any of the alledged
plans. The defendants face sentences ranging from five years and a

$10,000 fine to life imprisonment.

Our Trial

If it is true that there are critical cusps in the
growth of a being wherein contemplation must bring
forth right action, then Bucknell has arrived at one of
these cusps: the Trial.

A few Bucknellians are deeply involved in the case;
joes their involvement implicate all of Bucknell? That

cannot be answered due to the ambiguous

of “Bucknell.” Only a two-third faculty vote

» this riddle. (Or perhaps a committee should
ggle through the problem.)

However, the world (the media) will find difficulty
in differentiating the Bucknell 4 from the Bucknell
3000. Although we may never have heard of the Berri-
gans, Boyd Douglas, or even Zoia Horn, our parents,
friends and alumni will ask us, “Did you know them?”
or, “What were they like?” And, of course, “Are there
many more on campus?”

We have the opportunity to learn how to act when
a cusp presents itself. Bucknell has been blessed with a

tragedy.

Sometime in the afternoon or evening the Grand Jury hands down
ndictments against the Harrisburg Six. Judge Herman, who is to be in
charge of the case, sends out est orders. Within the hour all six de-
fendants are in custody. One story claims that fifteen FBI agents picked
up Sister Elizabeth.

In a statement issued from Danbury Federal Prison, the Berrigans
deny the charges and in return charge the government with a counter-
conspiracy “‘to destroy the peace movement by creating caricatures of
those who oppose the war in Southeast Asia . . . to stigmatize millions
of morally dedicated opponents of our military involvement in Indo China
as violent and deranged people.’ The Berrigans further urge all Ameri-
eans “to repudiate the use of fabricated charges, and state trials to
facilitate the implementation of foreign and domestic policies.” (N.Y.
Times, Jan. 13, 1971).

JANUARY 13, 1971 — Counsel for Mrs. Horn, Miss Rom, Mr. Joynt
and Mrs. Chanel request Judge Herman to squash all their subpoenas.
They argue that since the Grand Jury has already handed down in-
dictments further questioning of witnesses would constitute an illegal
“fishing expedition,” that the work of supporting the indictments belongs
to the trial, not to the hearing. In lieu of this request being granted, they
ask the judge to instruct the jury not to ask questions concerning persons
already indicted or which concern matters outside the Middle District of
the Federal Court. Prosecuting Attorney, Guy Goodwin, opposes these
moves on the grounds that the Grand Jury is working towards further
indictments. Judge Herman denies all the motions.

Miss Hoover and Miss Sandel testify under Use Immunity, answering
all questions to the best of their ability.

JANUARY 14, 1971 — Counsel Levitan, representing Mrs. Chanel, re-
quests a postponement of her testimony on the grounds that she is
mentally incompetent to take the stand or to communicate adequately
with him as her lawyer. He produces evidence that she had a mental
collapse during the summer and was confined for a while in a mental
institution. Judge Herman denies his motion. Mr. Levitan then requests
that he be removed as her counsel since he cannot communicate with
her. Judge Herman denies this request too.

Thanksgiving

Dear Editor:

At December’s faculty meeting
the faculty rejected a motion by
Mr. Heath and me to discuss by
March of 1971 the possibility of
adjusting the fall semester calen-
dar so as to allow for a week-long
recess at mid-semester. Discuss it
or not, the problem our motion re-
sponded to remains and we were
grateful to note your sympathy for
our approach in an editorial.

A mid-semester break seems to
us a deficiency in the fall semester
calendar which does not exist in the
spring. Its absence does not merely
throw the new 4-1-4 calendar out of
balance, but restrains it from at-
taining its full potential. A recess
such as ours would relieve the pres-
sures brought on by the shortened
fall semester. It would give stu-
dents lagging behind a chance to
catch up and avoid ‘‘incompletes.”’
Students in good standing could
read ahead, work on papers or start
planning a January project. The
absence of a significant recess in
the fall, compounded by the inter-
ference of Thanksgiving during the
half-week we do receive, places
pressure on the January Plan. The
January period offers students res-
pite from another inequity of the
system: without January students
would have 6 weeks to remove an
incomplete” received in the fall,
but 16 weeks to remove one re-
ceived in the spring. By misusing
January 417 students (17% of the
enrollment) last year extended that
6 weeks to 10.

The mid-semester would
serve as a convenient deadline for
papers and mid-semester grades.
It would off instructors an op-
portunity to grade papers and quiz-
zes, adjust course schedules or give
some thought to January.

The spring recess serves ju
these functions (save the last).
Since the fall semester has been
compacted, we need this flexible
scheduling joint even more in the
fall than in the spring. The function
of a recess has traditionally been to
relieve pressures. Yet while most
faculty members with whom we
have spoken agree that pressures
are greater in the fall, not only do
we maintain a shorter recess then,
interfered with by Thanksgiving,
but it is delayed until almost the
end of the semester.

The known arguments against
this change are cultural, bureau-
cratic and financial. The cultural
argument reputes Thanksgiving to
be an indispensible season of family
reunion. But then so is Xmas. The
Xmas holidays—2 weeks of them—
begin three weeks after Thanksgiv-
ing holidays. Do we really carry
on so well for 10 months without
seeing relatives we so desprately
love that to be reunited with them,
we must shut down our institution
twice in two months, for 2-3 weeks
out of 6? We suggest that Xmas
and summer holidays coupled with
working recesses in the fall and
spring is ample opportunity for re-
union (or reunification).

The bureaucratic argument is
that scheduling a mid-semester re-
cess would shorten by 2%4 more
days an already short semester.
Our change would not involve short-
ening the semester but simply re-
designating ‘he purpose of 24% days
as working recess rather than
classroom days. We would argue in
the second place that the addit-
inoal flexibility accruing to faculty
and students from this redesigna-
tion would be a qualitative asset
that would more than replace any
qualitative loss. All this presup-
poses, of course, the impossibility
of extending the semester by be-
ginning earlier in the fall.

As to the second argument, we
would suggest that faculty attitudes
toward cutting classes Friday after
Thanksgiving remain the same as
its attitudes toward cutting class
the days preceding Thanksgiving
under the present calendar,

The financial and staff problems
seem more intimidating but in view
of the dimensions of the academic
problem, an attempt to find solu-
tions would seem warranted. That
the University facilities be kept
open during the recess is no es-
sential point of our proposal. Clos-
ing the facilities during the recess
to economize would in no significant
way undermine our objectives

recess

en

which are to establish a working
recess comparable to the spring
recess.

Food services would have to be
kept open on Thanksgiving day, but
it would seem that most other serv-
ives could be suspended. There
might even be enough students will-
ing to help maintain the facilities
in return for a week off preceding
elections. We are not convinced of
the inescapability of assuming Fri-
day following Thanksgiving to be a
holiday. This is certainly not the
case in most sectors of the econo-
my. And we find it hard to believe
that Bucknell offers less time off
to its staff than surrounding busi-
nesses and industries.

Bucknell has embarked, however
half-heartedly, on a 4-1-4 plan with

Letters to the Editor

minimum distribution requirements
and interdepartmental majors, en-
couraging curricular experimenta-
tion and creativity. But we have
done so with a schedule that is
signally oppressive to that very
creativity. Mr. Heath and I feel
that we must promote unharrassed
creativity however possible if Buck-
nell is to achieve the identity it
needs to compete with “prestige”
schools. The obvious alternatives
to our proposal are clearly unap-
pealing. Retaining a schedule at
odds with curricular goals would be
self-defeating. Returning to our pre-
vious schedule, with the concomi-
tant loss of January, we would hold
to be even more ominous.

Questions

By JACK SCHMIDT

In their December stories concerning college campuses, major media
observers universally agreed that the fall semester had been a quiet one.
It was not a difficult conclusion to arrive at.

Still affected by the euphoria of the May student strikes, many po-
litical activists had predicted mass student involvement in the Congress-
ional elections of the fall. McCarthy-style groups organized, such as the
Princeton-based Movement for a New Congress, but they failed to gen-
erate sizable student support. Other peace related activities were begun,
such as a drive for a national ‘“‘end the war’? petition, but they failed to
spark interest. A quiet hung over the campuses which one Cornell senior
tried to explain, “Sure everything’s quiet, but people are not content.
The same problems are there . . . But the thing is, people just don’t
know what to do, so they’re not doing anything.”

Among the many explanations offered was the one outlined in Charles
Reich’s The Greening of America. Reich envisioned a revolution coming
which would “‘originate with the individual and with culture,” and would
“change the political structure only as its final act.” Reich maintained
that youth had turned from the old political ways of mass action. Youth
was living a new set of values which it could not politically compromise
away.

Whatever the explanation offered, observers agreed that the fall was
the milestone in making the beginning of the new quiet campus mood.
One semester cannot, however, serve as any indicator, and we must look
to the upcoming semester to provide more insight into the observations
already made.

The fall had been unique in its issuelessness. As the Nixon Vie‘nam-
ization policy had moved into high gear, much of the support had been
drained from the anti-war movement. The hard core had remained, but
the hangers-on, who provide the needed manpower, had been lost to other,
more private concerns. There had been a real lack of controversial

issues, save the elections (and what issues are ever really discussed ¢

s semester, however, one can find many contro-
versial political issues which may spark student interest: Angela Davis,
Bobby Seale, and the Harrisburg Six will all be involved in nationally
known judicial proceedings; a May Day siege is being planned on Wash-
ington, D.C.; an attempt will be made to ratify a peace treaty between
the peoples of Vietnam and the United States; and the Congress must
vote to extend the Selective Service Act beyond this summer.

Some groups are already mobilizing to action, but it is too early to
determine any trends. In May, one may be better able to judge if we are
really entering the era of the quiet ’70’s. No one can be sure— a semester
full of question marks.

Mermen Ride High Wave;
Swimmers Meet Syracuse

By MARK KNODERER

Dick Russell's mermen, now
sporting a 6-1 record, head into
February after a long month of
hard work and improving times.
In January the team posted wins
over Delaware, Pittsburgh, Lafay-
ette, Cornell, and LaSalle, while
losing to a powerful Army team.

The most dramatic victory of the
month was the 60-53 triumph over
Cornell on January 23. The meet
was a revenge of sorts for several
of the Bisons who played on the
water polo team and suffered three
defeats at the hands of the Big
Red

The Bisons were behind most of
the way in this meet, at one time
trailing by as much as 13 points
They were also behind in the free-
style relay when anchor man Peter
O’Keeffe took off after Cornell’s
Bill Balchunas. O’Keeffe caught
him at t ir rn, and turned
on a tremendous sprint during the
fourth lap to win by seven tenths
of a second

The other January victories were
more or less routine. Delaware was
defeated 68-43, Pitt 76-37, Lafayette

41, and LaSalle 76-37. The loss
to Army, however, was another
story.

Army has the second best team
in the East, and hurdling Bucknell
was no large obstacle for. them.

r five events the Cadets held

10 lead and the meet was all
but over. The Cadets eased up, and
the Bisons came back to make the
score a respectable 66-46

During January, Coach Russell
worked the team very hard, and
the squad frequently put in 5,000
yards a day. The team did not ease
up for the tough meets, Army and
Cornell, because, in Russell’s own
words ‘We have only one goal this
year: winning the M.A.C. champ-
ionship.”

The most pleasant result of the
work is the development of the
freshmen, several of whom are
turning in excellent times. Sprinter
Steve Winings rebroke his own
record in the 50 free style (21.7)

and will probably drop some more |

before the season is over. He has
also developed into a threat in the
100 free, frequently breaking 50
seconds flat. A second sprinter is
Dough Storey, who has splashed to
23.2 in the 50 free and 52.2 in the
100 free.

Distance men Gary Norton and
Doug Roberts are inching closer to
senior Mike Huffman everyday.
Against LaSalle last Saturday |

of a second in the 1000, and Roberts
by nine tenths of a second in the
500.

Russell has also developed two
freshmen breastrokers to comple-
ment the fine group he already has.
Scott Heffley has posted a time of
2:29.0 and Jim Hughes 2:32.1 in the
200 breastroke.

As for the varsity, what can be
said? Peter O’Keeffe, when not
winning the 200 free and 500 free,
took time off to smash the 200 back-
stroke record with a glittering time
of 2:00.2.

Paul Landes is “back” after a
disappointing sophomore year, and
is approaching his best times in
all events, including a 49.3 relay
split against Cornell.

The two co-captains, Mike Huff-
man and Jack Krohmer are also
having fine years. Huffy is within

conds of his best times of last

r in both the 1000 and 500, and
with two freshmen pushing him, is
likely to lower them

Krohmer has been busting 50
seconds flat for 100 free all year,
and has won several key races.

The breastroke trio of Bob Ras-
mussen, Matt Slick, and Charlie
Wilf are having their best year by
far. At the present time, Slick has
posted a time of 2:23.8, Raz
and Wilf, before a leg injury side-
lined him, 2:27.3.

On the diving boards, Ronn Jenk-
ins has developed the best duo that
the Bisons have ever had in Ron
Farr and Bob Richards. Both are
now consistantly over 200 points on
both the one and three meter
boards, and have shown steady im-
provement.

Leopards Beat Big Blue;

Cagers Clash with NYU

By ALAN GROCHAL

With hopes of breaking a 6 game
losing streak, the Bison cagers will
meet NYU tomorrow night at NYU.

BU will be looking to reverse a
59-58 loss from last season. The
Herd will be making its first ap-
pearance at NYU since 1955 and
is seeking its first win ever over
the Violets.

NYU is 3-11 on the season and is
sporting a losing streak of its

own. The Violets played Manhatten
last night.

A spectacular 36 point perform-
ance by Lafayette’s Tracy Tripucka
led the Leopards to a 87-73 win over
the Bisons last Tuesday.

Tripucka, the nation’s eleventh
leading scorer, netted 22 points in
a first half that saw Lafayette lead
by 14 at intermission.

The Thundering Herd managed to
pull within 4 points, 30-26, midway

The mermen have made a big splash this past January while compiling

a 6-1 record. Here, they are readying to “plunge ahead” in final prepara-
tion for their meet against Syracuse this Saturday.

WVBU will broadcast the Bison’s
basketball game against the Violets
of New York University, live from
New York City, starting at 7:30
p.m. this Saturday, February 6.

passing and shooting by the Leo-

the half.

In the second half, Lafayette led
by as much as 18 points, but the
Bisons pulled to within 10 three
times only to be pushed back.
Fouls hurt the Herd as Jim Dono-
van, Dave Greenwood, and Chris
Riley all had to sit out part of the
game due to personal fouls.

Offensive standouts for the Bisons
were Harvey Carter and Jim Dono-
van with 21 and 16 points respec-
tively.

During intersession, BU compiled
a 5-7 mark, but included in the
victories was a championship in the
Albright Invitational. The Bisons
won their first game in the Christ-

Williams by a wide margin, 71-52.

BU’s Paul Biko was voted out-

Biko and Dave Greenwood, both
sophomores, were named to the

The Herd followed this champ-

then they eased by Colgate 61-60 on

By JENNY CHEN

Announcement was made last
night that John Zellers’ official
title will become Vice President
for Administration and Finance. Ad-
ded to his present duties he will co-
ordinate alumni relations, develop-
ment, and public relations.

Also on the agenda of the month-
ly faculty meeting was a report
brought back to the faculty with
recommendations for programs for
students with differently prepared
backgrounds.

The first motion of four which
were approved for consideration
asked that the Summer Transitional
Program be reviewed by the Com-
mittee of Academic Regulations. A
question was asked whether the
budget could support this program.
Jt was noted that $8,000 is pro-

Library Exhibits
Jan Plan Photos

By LUCY TYRRELL

A photography exhibit recently
placed in the student lounge of the
Bertrand Library displays repre-
sentative photos taken by the par-
ticipants in the photography work-
shop January Plan and the Photo-
graphy Club.

This exhibit, to be in the lounge
for two weeks, is comprised en-
tirely of black and white photo-
graphs, the medium dealt with in
the January plan on photagraphy,
directed by Mr. James D. Lyon,
Jr.

Mr. Lyon evaluated the plan as
being very successful. Approxi-
mately forty-five participants, in-
cluding students from other cam-
puses and 2 faculty wives, were
divided into two sections—begin-
ners, numbering about thirty, and
those who studied more advanced
techniques.

suggested

that at least two or three indi-
viduals should participate in this
summer program, which has been
designated the East Pennsylvania
Consortium for Differently Prepared
Students.

The second objective it to have
an advisor who could identify with
the students but who is not re-
stricted to these differently pre-
pared students.

A summer recruitment program,
the Afro-Americans for Educational
Opportunity, would recruit minority
group students to higher education.
It would cover differently prepared
students at a minimum, not neces-
sarily Afro-American students.

The fourth motion concerns
special programs to help the dif-
ferently prepared students. It was
pointed out by Provost Wendel
Smith that exceptions would not be
made for these students that would
hinder academic programs, in
answer to Professor Emil Polak’s
question. There would be supple-
mental services such as tutoring
which would be provided.

In other business, Provost Wendel
Smith presented a motion that
would designate the visiting pro-
fessor of Military Science of ROTC
as a participant in vote and voice
only in matters of ROTC during
faculty meetings.

Professor Hugh McKeegan a-
mended the motion asking to
change voice and vote to encom-
pass all faculty affairs.

It was pointed out that ROTC is
a program and not an academic
department. With this end to de-
bate, the amendment was defeated.

Another amendment presented by
Professor Robert Beard asked that
visiting professor of Military Sci-
ence be changed to Director of the
military program. The amended
motion was finally passed by voice
vote.

the Hotline. It’s professionals who
refuse to ignore the inevitable prob-
lems of 2900 college students. In
short, SIS is people who care.

Organized last year by students
who recognized the need for an
easily accessible source of informa-
tion and help, the Student Informa-
tion Service (SIS) consists of three
student-run branches: the Informa-
tion Center, Hotline and Peer
Counseling.

Recently a new administrative
and advisary system was initiated.
Replacing the old steering com-
mittee as an advisary board, con-
sisting of SIS adviser Thomas J.
Risch, Dean of Men; Jack Blyskal,
coordinator; Geoff Blood, in charge
of the Information Center; Glenn
Kidder, in charge of Hotline; Karen
Farnsworth, in charge of Peer
Counseling; and three other mem-
bers from the University’s pro-

Meeting

The Bucknellian will hold a staff
meeting on Tuesday at 7 p.m. in
102-A coleman. Anyone interested
in working on the paper this se-
mester is also invited to attend.

fessional community. The latter
have not yet been definitely chosen.

“We hope it (the re-organization)
will make us more efficient,” said
coordinator Jack Blyskal, who will
act as a combined executive secre-
tary, treasurer, and correlator of
information. “It will give us the
potential for a more broad-based
system of operation.”

One department that is expand-
ing, both in services and in staff,
is the Information Center. Located
in the back room of the Bison, the
center maintains a bulletin board
and a collection of pamphlets of
interest to students, in addition to
taking calls at 1346 daily from 12
noon to 9 p.m. Students are en-
couraged to dial this number dur-
ing the day until Hotline goes into
operation at 8 p.m.

At an open meeting for the In-
formation Center last Friday, some
new volunteers were signed up,
and plans were made to gather and
correlate all kinds of new informa-
tion which could be of use to stu-
dents. The ultimate aim is to make
the service as complete and com-
prehensive as possible.

“We need ton of help,’ Geoff
Blood said yesterday, asking volun-
teers to check the SIS bulletin
board in the back room of the Bison
for a list of jobs. Those interested
in helping or having suggestions
should leave a note there or else
contact the office. ‘‘Also, if anyone
has any information, they can call
it in,” he added.

Hotline continues to operate at its
usual time—from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
every night. The number is 1515
The students on duty are trained
to handle any kind of call—from
simple requests for information to
matters of extreme personal crisis

“We try to answer the questions
to the best of our ability,’ explains
Blyskal, “and, where necessary,
make referrals to the proper
agency or person.” The big thing
we stress is anonymity. That’s why
we don’t publicize who is on Hot-
line.” Callers need not identify
themselves; however, he empha-
sized: “Our files are confidential
and locked. Only the people on Hot-
line can get to them.”

Both Information Center and Hot-
line personnel must undergo in-
tensive training before they are
allowed to answer the phones. This
training is conducted by the re-
spective SIS department heads and
by qualified professionals from both
on and off campus.

Trainees are taught techniques
for handling crisis situations and
procedures for referring callers to
other sources such as peer counsel-
ors. The latter are fellow students
with specialized knowledge on such
subjects as the draft, drugs, alco-
hol, abortion, and birth control.

Hotline callers may also be di-
rected to the Pregnancy Clinic, a
subgroup of Peer Counseling headed
by Jeff Sengstack.

Harrisburg Six Trial

Editor’s Note: This is the second of a two part chronology on the

Harrisburg Six Trial.

Librarians Called

JANUARY 15, 1971 — Judge Herman hears a request for reduction
of bail for the three Baltimore defendants: Frs. Neil McLaughlin and
Joseph Wenderoth and Mr. Scoblick. Eleven character witnesses are
presented. Judge Herman questions one of them, Rev. J. William Michael
man, concerning the manner and extent to which he had demonstrated
on occasion with some of the defendants. The Judge lowers the bail by
half, requiring ten percent in cash, a total of $7,500. He restricts their
travel to New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware.

Mrs. Horn and Miss Rom are called by the Grand Jury; they refuse
to answer each question on the grounds that they might incriminate

themselves.

Prosecutor Goodwin asks for Use Immunity for Sister Joques. Jack
Levine, her lawyer, opposes such immunity as unconstitutional. The

Defining Our Goals

Harrisburg Six Trial Intrigues Campus __ Library Unveils

It is time to examine the motives
behind recent University actions. We ap-
plaud the adoption of the four proposals
of the Subcommittee on Differently Pre-
pared Students. These proposals aimed
at facilitating the transition from ghetto
life to the college campus and easing the
strain of social and academic pressures
on minority group students should have
been implemented long ago. Why is the
University only now expanding its
“social consciousness ?”

The answer to the question we now
face involves nothing less than a full-
scale redefinition of the goals of this and
every institution of higher learning.
Have we acted upon the problems of mi-
nority group students simply because
the time for remedying these difficulties

as come? Just what are our reasons
for existing? In order to make rational
decisions, in order to make critical judge-
ments, in order to solve problems facing
the institution, the objectives of the Uni-
versity must be known.

Should we exist to train men and
women for prospective careers, thereby
acting as a certification board for in-
dustry? Are we an academic community
whose goal is to impart knowledge to a
select number of middle and upper class
students? The universities are the re-
positories of knowledge; should they
then play a more central role in guiding
the development of society? Should we
be committed to. raising! society from ig-
norance to understanding?

On the anniversary marking one
hundred and twenty-five years of pro-
viding knowledge to thousands, we must
come to the realization that we have lost
our sense of direction. There is no clear
conception of what the University should
be. We feel that the present proposals
for Differently Prepared Students out-
line an excellent beginning to the solu-
tion of a pressing need. However, the
final resolution of this and future prob-
lems hinges upon our determination of
the purpose of the academic community.

Keeping Score

Here is your official Bucknellian Score Sheet. With
it, you can keep a running tally of how many “we” get
and how many “they” get during the Laotian “incurs-
ion.” Symbols representing the dead can vary with one’s
taste; you may segregate the victims by People or lump
them together (no pun intended).

Since the Administration has imposed censorship
on information regarding the invasion, the news media
has been even more restricted than usual in trying to
determine our real motives in Southeast Asian actions.
In the event that you wish to “widen the scope” of your
Score Sheet, you may use it for the more mundane pur-
pose of determining who’s “winning” and who’s “losing”
in the rest of Indochina.

Harrisburg Implications

By PHILIP WITHIM

ng of the FE

the Bucknell
pointed out

sburg Six and the subpoenaning of four
ommunity has important implications which
need to be

Obviously if a me has been committed, the Government has the
obligation to prosec he potentially guilty. But this is the only right
the Government has in raising prosecutions, and, unfortunately, the Gov-
ernment’s record in this area is strained. The behavior of Judge Ford in
the Spock case and of Judge Hoffman in Chicago has been outrageous.
The convictions obtained in the Spock case have been overturned, and
there is a strong possibility that the Chicago convictions will meet the
same fate.

In the case of the Seattle 7 (now arrived at a mistrial) the defense
was able to establish that a paid informer, using FBI funds supplied for
that purpose, purchased dynamite, bomb-makings, LSD and other drugs,
and gave them to the Weathermen. He provided a gun for himself and
taught its use. He admitted on the stand that many of the Weathermen
had never handled a gun before. He also admitted that he urged the de-
fendants to violent and illegal actions. At this time the defendants are still
in jail awaiting a Government decision on a new trial. The judge has
forbidden bail even in the face of a superior court decision. (Nation, Jan.
25.)

The Law

The conspiracy statute itself is very vague; It makes intentions
illegal, rather than ons. Under its conditions as few as two people
can constitute a conspiracy. If, in a given group of dissenters, one under-
takes a single action, not in itself illegal (such as a phone call), which
can be construed as furthering the objectives of a conspiracy, all who
spoke together about the plan—even if it was never seriously considered,
even if they never knew of the action—can be tried for c rimes carrying
a penalty of life imprisonment.

Under conditions such as these, completely innocent people may well
be advised by counsel to take the Fifth Ammendment so as to protect
themselves against twisted or malicious interpretations of what they said
or thought. More importantly, innocent people may feel as a matter of
conscience that they must challenge the Government at some point,
risking contempt of court, so that other persons in more awkward situa-
tions may have that full protection of the Bill of Rights to which every
citizen is entitled.

Once a government’s motives for pursuing a particular prosecution
are in question, it becomes useful to inquire what government so gains.
One possible effect is that such actions necessarily break up and disperse
dissenting groups. Word from Seattle pictures social action organizations
there as demoralized, passive, filled with distrust of each other. On the
larger scene, the nation-wide peace movement still has not recovered
from the impact of the Chicago prosecution. All over the country trials
are taking place that involve leaders of dissenting citizens whose energies
are now spent defending themselves, rather than instructing and teaching
the public.

A trial of the Harrisburg Six will certainly serve to divert the form-
idable energies of the Berrigans. If convicted Philip Berrigan could be
kept behind bars for the rest of his life even though no kidnapping had
ever occurred, even though not one single illegal action was ever es-
tablished, even though Berrigan himself rejects all violence to any person.
Quite obviously, if people like the Berrigans could be kept perpetually

_Letters to the

Journalism
To The Editor:

Approximately one year ago, at
least fifty university students sign-
ed a petition expressing genuine
interest in having journalism
courses offered here. And, follow-
ing ar of consulting with Harry
R, arvin, English Department
Chairman, and the department’s
Committee on Hiring and Retention,
Mike Scheinberg and I would like
to report our results.

After much deliberation, the Com-
mittee decided that it could not “at
this time or in the foreseeable fu-
ture hire a staff member for the
purpose of instituting courses in
journalism.”

Several alternatives were then
considered: study at area colleges
now offering journalism courses;
study via qualified personnel
brought to the campus; and, finally,
journalistic study in connection with
the January Program

The Committee stated that the
January Program was especially
designed for the “kind of educa-
tional experience that the regular
curriculum cannot provide and
which offers the most satisfactory
procedure for bringing to the cam-
pus temporary instructors in jour-
nalism or for allowing students to
seek out journalism instruction
elsewhere.”

The Committee consists of Dennis
Baumwoll, Harry Garvin (Ex of-
ficio), K. Ward Hooker, Karl Pat-
ten, John Wheatcroft and John
Tilton, its chairman.

Mike Scheinberg and I wish to
thank the Committee for its honest
deliberation, and those who signed
the petition for showing interest
and patience. Hopefully, those in-
dividuals who would seek out
journalistic experience will utilize
Jan Plan 1972. Such an action
would certainly be another step in
eventually bringing journalistic in-
struction formally to this univer-
sity.

Sincerely,
David Hammer

Prof. Cushman

To the Editor:

On 9 December, 1970 a petition
was sent to each member of the
Department of History concerning
the refusal to renew the contract
of Professor Mortimer Cushman.
As you recall, the students who
signed that petition agreed that
Professor Cushman has been not
only a “‘stimulating professor, but
also a man whose concern and in-
volvement have led to significant
contributions to the academic com-
munity and the Department of His-
tory.”

More than 80% of the students
who have had Professor Cushman
and who are still at Bucknell whole-
heartedly endorsed that statement.
When you reply that “the decision
was made only after careful con-
sideration of the feelings of stu-
dents who were fiercely loyal and
almost equally antagonistic,” I
must suggest that either your facts
were inaccurate or that you failed
to thoroughly investigate the nature
or even the quantity of student
complaints. In either case, the facts
would indicate the necessity of re-

EN

aS
consideration.

I am sure that you will also re-
call the letter which was submitt-d
with the petition. A most important
question raised in that letter, in
light of the charge that Dr. Cush-
man’s thesis was ‘“‘not history,”
was what, precisely, that disci-
pline entails. That question, yet
unanswered, merits response; until
it is answered, your charge can
surely have no validity.

Finally, I should ask again the
effects of one’s interdepartmental
relationships upon his teaching
ability. The overwhelming response
to the petition you have received
certainly indicates, even assuming
that poor relationships do exist,
that they have had little effect on
Professor Cushman’s efficiency as
a teacher. And he was hired, after
all, to teach.

In the close of your reply to our
petition you expressed a hope that
we maintain an “active interest”
in the affairs of your department.
As long as that department re-
le af to student voices, that
hope is unwarranted. I ask you
again to reconsider your refusal
to renew Dr. Cushman’s contract.

Sincerely,
Jeffrey Hirshberg

Junk Mail
To the Editor:

Upon discovering a fistful of
“junk mail’? in your mailbox this
past week, what did you do with it?
As discarding it merely adds more
bulk to the garbage accumulation

ditor

LLL RE

in the mail rooms, the best idea is
to refuse to accept it.

By opening it and mailing back
the enclosed material in the ak
ready postpaid envelope provided ,
by the sender, we can force that
company to pay first-class postal
rates for our refusal to be bom-
barded by the stuff. If everyone
were to take a minute to do this
every time he received a piece of
junk mail, perhaps the companies
involved would lose money and stop
sending the junk.

Show your outrage! Don’t dis-

Appreciation
To The Editor:

Lt. Colonel and Mrs. John P.
Younger and John, Jr., the family
of Peter G. Younger, have asked
that I try to convey the family’s
great appreciation to Peter’s many
friends and those members of the
faculty and the University’s pro«
fessional staff for the expressions
of sympathy, offers of help and
great comfort which have been ex-
tended to them.

The Younger family wishes it
were possible to acknowledge every-
one’s kindness individually; how-
ever, since that would be almost
impossible, they have requested the
cooperation of The Bucknellian in
expressing their gratitude.

judge recesses the Grand Jury hearing until he can hand down a de-
cision on January 25.

JANUARY 19, 1971 — Attorney General Mitchell seals the prison
records of Boyd Douglas. Reporters succeed in having the files reopened.
In the next several days the records are alternately opened and closed;
some material seems to be missing while other material remains sealed.

JANUARY 25, 1971 — Judge Herman hears oral arguments on the
Use Immunity. Defense counsel argues that Use Immunity evades full
protection of the Fifth Amendment since a person can still be tried for
the transaction about which he testifies. The judge rebuts this point, ob-
serving that as long as he is on the bench, Sister Joques will be fully
protected. Prosecutor Goodwin insists that Use Immunity confers the full
protection required by the Fifth Ammendment. After listening for over an
hour to Levine making the same argument several ways, the judge re-
marks, ‘‘I see your point, I just don’t believe it.” He rules in favor of
the prosecution’s request for the infliction of Use Immunity on Sister
Joques. In this way, Judge Herman avoided ruling directly on the consti-
tutionality of the new immunity statute. Instead he finds the defense
counsel’s request for denial ‘‘without merit.”

On the same day, a federal judge in Detroit rules, in another case,
that the attorney general does not have the right to undertake wiretaps
without a court order in domestic cases even to protect the national
security. Judge Keith’s order is similar to another given by Judge
Ferguson in Los Angeles on January 12. Judge Keith ordered the govern-
ment to surrender its wiretap evidence to the defense within forty-eight
hours.

These cases are relevant to the Harrisburg Six because so much of
the Grand Jury questioning, and several of the alleged “overt acts,” in-
volve phone calls. Also, Sister Joques is accusing the government of wire-
tapping her religious order. If a significant portion of the government’s
evidence depends on illegal wiretapping, effective prosecution of its case
may be rendered all but impossible.

Investigation Continues

JANUARY 26, 1971 — Special Prosecuting Attorney Guy Goodwin un-
expectedly moves in court to grant Transactional Immunity to Sister
Joques on the conspiracy and kidnapping charges. The judge grants it.
The day before both the judge and the Prosecutor had agreed that Trans-
actional Immunity was not necessary since Use Immunity already offered
“genuine and complete protection.” The government’s reasons for so
moving are not clear. Sister Joques is called to testify before the Grand
Jury. To each question she replies that the law under which she is asked
to testify is unconstitutional in that (1) it permits the government to use
her testimony against her in all transactions to which the immunity does
not apply, (2) because this Grand Jury has already named her as a co-
conspirator; (3) because the Grand Jury is exceeding its proper scope by
asking her questions pertaining to matters outside the Middle District
jurisdiction.

Sister Joques is cited for contempt and removed to York County
Prison. Judge Herman refuses bail.

Prosecutor Goodwin requests Transactional Immunity for Mrs. Horn,
Miss Rom, Mr. Joynt and Mrs. Chanel. The Judge grants it. (on Jan. 27)

JANUARY 27, 1971 — Joseph Joynt and Patricia Rom testify, answer-
ing all questions to the best of her ability. Mrs. Zoia Horn begins her
testimony as the day closes.

JANUARY 28, 1971 — Fr. William Michaelman, who had been a

character witness last January 15 for the Baltimore Three has been
subpoenaed by the Grand Jury. His counsel, Mr. Gallagher, requests the
court to quash the supoena on the grounds that questioning by the Grand
Jury would violate the spiritual relationship existing between Fr. Michael-
man and the defendants, particularly Scoblick, who has come to live with
him. The motion is denied.

Counsel Levitan, arguing for his client, Mrs. Patricia Chanel, requests
permission to be at her side in the Grand Jury room when she is in-
terrogated. Such a procedure is without precedent. Mr. Levitan presents
the opinion of two psychiatrists that Mrs. Chanel is incompentent to judge
the questions properly. He reminds the Court that last summer she had
spent time in a mental institution. The judge denies the motion.

In the afternoon, Mrs. Horn finishes her testimony, answering all
questions to the best of her ability. Fr. Michaelman is called. Under in-
structions from his lawyer, he emerges from the Grand Jury room forty
times in two hours requesting counsel for every question. Later Gallagher
tells the press that Fr. Michaelman “replied to every question.” But no
one knows what is meant by the word “‘reply.’’ Mr. Goodwin announces
that Fr. Michaelman as well as Mrs. Chanel, who has already waited two
weeks to testify will be ‘‘continued” until Feb. 10. Nobody knows why, or
whether this also means the Grand Jury is in recess.

JANUARY 29, 1971 — A panel of three judges in Federal Circuit
Court sitting in Philadelphia releases Sister Joques on her recognizance
and without bail.

In New York Judge Constance Baker Motley, dealing with another
case, rules that Use Immunity is not constitutional. She states that the
right against self-incrimination must be upheld with a liberal construc-
tion “if we are to keep faith with the patriots who fougl.: for the inclusion
of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution.” In a thirty-four page decision,
Judge Motley observes that Fifth Ammendment protection against self-
incrimination has become ‘‘the touchstone of our adversarial system.”
She indicates that the immunity granted must be ‘“‘co-extensive with the
privilege.”’

The divergences between the rulings of Judge Herman andJudge
Motley are very great. If the Supreme Court eventually upholds the
rulings of Judges Keith and Ferguson in their decisions that wiretapping
without a court order is unconstitutional and also upholds Judge Motley’s
decision that Use Immunity offers inadequate protection, such action is
bound to have a major impact on the development of the Harrisburg case

In the meantime, a story concerning a second Grand Jury, meeting in
Wilmington, Delaware, has broken. It is suspected that this Jury is
concerned with draft board cases. It is known that Sister Elizabeth has
appeared before it. Several Harrisburg witnesses had also apparently been
asked about draft boards. Defense counsel had argued before Judge Her-
man that such questions were outside the scope of the Harrisburg Jury
It appears that the two Grand Juries may be re-enforcing each other
although such “fishing expeditions’ are illegal. It remains to be seen
whether or not the two Grand Juries have exceeded their charge.

SERVICES

Abortions up to 24 weeks of
pregnancy are now legal in New

abortion, early abortions are
simpler and safer.

Abortions should be per-

would be impared.

Another effect of political trials is to focus public awareness on purely
local and national dramas of great intensity and interest, using them
Ikie a Roman Circus to distract the populace from our foreign adventures.
By prosecuting intentions of violence, the Government can hope to divert
the public from its prosecution of the war in Indo-China, that is away
from the most actual, the most ghastly of violence. The Government by
attacking violence against property can seek to avoid investigation and
exposure of its own violence against persons, against whole peoples.

A particular problem for Bucknell concerns the study release program
set up between the University and the Bureau of Prisons, a program de-
signed to help people move easily and effectively from the prison to
civilian life. If Boyd Douglas was released to study here so that he could
spy on campus dissenters, on visitors to the town and prison, or so that
he could be a provocateur, then the Government has abused that program
and has betrayed the proper relationship between the Government and
a center of learning, of free inquiry.

Hoopsters Fail

to Halt Skid;

Baby Bisons Continue Winning

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

The varsity cagers took it on the
chin again last Saturday night as
they dropped a 63-52 decision to the
NYU Violets. The Big Blue had top
efforts from Chris Riley and Jim
Donovan with 19 and 12 points re-
spectively but it was an uphill fight
all the way.

It was a game marked with fouls
as Paul Biko and Chris Riley fouled
out and Larry Greenwood, Harvey
Carter, and Jack Darnell all pick-
ed up four apiece.

The Bisons were down 30-23 at
the half but they reeled off 9
straight points to take a short lived
32-30 lead.

Tonight the cagers will try to halt
their losing streak as they face the
yettysburg Bullets. The Bisons beat
the Bullets earlier this season 73-
67 so come out and support your
team.

The Baby Bisons pulled out a
close 51-50 decision against the
NYU frosh to raise their season’s
record to 8-4. Hal Thomas won the
game when, with less than 30 sec-
onds left, he hit both ends of a one
on one situation from the foul line
to put the Bisons over by one.

Big Paul Kerr had scoring honors
for the night with 18 while team-
mate Algin Garrett chipped in with
ten. George Tillery controlled the
boards for the Blue and Orange
with 10 rebounds.

Three of the freshmen losses have

been by 4 points or less but the
cagers are currently riding a 4
game winning streak. In the past
week the Baby Bisons have beaten
Lafayette 61-52, with all five start-
ers hitting double figures.

Paul Kerr is currently leading
the team averaging 19 points a
game while George Tillery leads
the rebounding department.

Jim Donovan has added much of-
fensive spark and greater board
strength since breaking into the

President Expresses Concern
About Douglas’ Informer Role

By JACK SCHMIDT

President Charles Watts expres-
sed concern over the ‘apparent
misuse” of the federal prison sys-
tem’s rehabilitation process in an
interview with the Bucknellian
Thursday morning.

The study-release rehabilitation
program is designed to allow uni-
versity study while an inmate is
serving his sentence at a prison.
Under this plan, Boyd Douglas, who
alledgedly provided information to
federal officials regarding the ac-
tivities of peace activists, partic-
ularly involved with the Harrisburg
Six trial, attended the University
during 1970

When asked what his particular
knowledge of Douglas’ actions had
been, Watts replied, “We knew we
had a rehabilitation system going,
and we knew how many people
were here under it, but that was
all.”

Watts said that he had learned
about Douglas’ activities through
the national media

Watts did not hint at any im-
mediate action to be taken on his
part to talk with federal officials
about the matter. “I must be sure
of the facts, and I would like to see
what action the faculty takes on
the matter.’’ Watts said.

He was referring to a special
meeting of the faculty which has
been called for Monday, February
15 at 4:45 p.m. in Vaughan Litera-

ture Auditorium. The meeting will
discuss a motion presented by
Profs. Charles Longley and Jerry
Rinkus affirming the right of the
University to remain free from
government interference.

In related activities, Prof. Gene
Chenoweth announced at Thurs-
day’s AAUP open forum that he
would present an amendment to
the motion calling for the President
to organize an investigative com-
mittee to look into the matter.

Watts was uncertain about what
action to take on the recently pass-
ed ABS motion calling for the
elimination of parietal hours a
like to know what the administra-
tors think.” he said, but acknow-
ledged that vast changes must be
carried out in the University’s resi-
dential hall policies and programs.

He spoke in term of dev eloping a
‘sense of place’ among living unit
complexes, such as seen on the
campuses of Harvard and Yale.

When asked if the position of the
ABS is incompatible with the guide-
lines he is working under from the
Board of Trustees, Watts replied
that he is obliged to “‘live with the
requests of the Trustees” but would
seek to find common elements in
the positions of both sides.

Watts expects to continue in his
role as chief money raiser for the
University and is seeking to find
“the few large gifts the University
needs to sustain itself.”

ment” and expressing ‘‘outrage at

mostly from the University, joined

Gebauer Replaces Meyer
Concert Committee Discloses Problems

By GINA SMITH

Sophomore Kurt Gebauer will re-
place Andy Meyer as head of next
year’s concert committee. Meyer,
who has been largely responsible
for the concert series in the past
four years, notes the difficulties in
scheduling an act:

“The Chicago concert is a prime
example. I engaged Chicago a year
in advance. By Feb. 1 this year,
all tickets for the concert were sold
out.”

Realizing the dissatisfaction
among the students who had plan-
ned to buy tickets, Meyer spent
the following week negotiating with
Chicago. Their agreement to do a
second show marks the first con-
cert with two performances here.

The financial necessity of keep-
ing accurate records of ticket sales
forced the committee to declare
that season tickets be honored at
the first performance. Meyer re-
grets that season ticketholders must
pay the $1.65 difference to see the
second show.

He explains, “Allowing season
ticketholders a choice of perfor-
mance might have created a situa-
tion in which nearly everyone at-
tended one concert. This would
have over taxed our already-limit-
ed facilities of space and person-
nel.”’

This system of ticket cost can be
attributed to Chicago setting the
price of all second show tickets at
$5.50. If students were permitted to
switch their 7:30 for 10:00 p.m.
tickets, the concert committee
would have experienced as much
as a $10,000 loss.

“T feel badly that so many people
are dissatisfied with this arrange-
ment. I felt that by arranging for
the second show, a greater number
of students would at least see Chi-
cago,” he states.

Meyer defends the concert sys-
tem here by noting the low ticket
prices, good concerts, lack of can-
cellations, and few late starts in
the past. ‘“‘The Chicago concert has
been our only real hassle,” he
asserts.

Working primarily with Gebauer
and junior Steve Selinger, Meyer
tries to consider student opinions
in his efforts to book groups. How-
ever, the committee often is limit-
ed in what it can hire.

“Many ‘supergroups’ have be-
come rich and lazy: they refuse to
give concerts. Other groups find it
much easier and more profitable
to do, say, a Shea Stadium for
$50,000 a night than tour a number
of small colleges. Few groups like
it on the road, and for this reason,
the college concert is becoming
passe,” he claims.

For this reason, the concert com-
mittee has been seeking entertain-
ment somewhat different from the
standard musical act. Engagement
of “Groove Tube” and “Your Own
Thing’’ represent a departure from
this tradition

Gebauer explains that three main
criteria, other than cost and a
ability, are considered in selection
of acts. First, the group must be
good in concert. At least one mem-
ber of the concert committee must
see an act perform before hiring it

Second, there must be an interest
in the act here. Finally, the com-
mittee looks for an educational act;
it desires performers who present
novel, diverse entertainment

The concert committee works
through the National Entertainment
Conference, an organization of col-
lege committees. Periodic conven-
tions of this group are held at which
available groups are rated on per-
formance and cooperation.

It is possible to book groups at
these conventions but Gebauer
notes that barganing with agencies

Scheduled by Senior Class

By CATHLEEN EVANS

“Confrontation at Kent State,” to
be shown for no admission this Sat-
urday at 8:00 p.m., will be the first
of seven “underground” movies of-
fered by the Class of 1971. It is a
documentary made by students and
professors aS a “public service,”
containing interviews with local
Kent citizens who approved of the
Guard’s actions, a still photo dis-
play of the events of May 4, 1970,
and interviews with student, faculty
and Guard participants.

“Brand X” (March 4), reviewed
in the New York Times as “a
tacky, vulgar, dirty, somewhat dull,
often hilarious movie” which shows
the absurdity of today’s media,
“pretends to be a series of tele-
vision commercials, panel shows,
dramas and news broadcasts.” It
stars Taylor Mead, who “by simple
breathing, is an affront to all vested
interests,” with spot appearances
by Sally Kirkland, Frank Cavestani,
Abbie Hoffman and Sam Shepard.
“tts the application of Fellini to

content.”

“Contemporary community stand-
ards” will be put to the test with
the showing of “Coming Apart’”’
March 10), a film which is “‘very
blunty singularly preoccupied with
naked bodies and uses to which
those bodies can be put by libidin-
ous human beings.’ Probably a
take-off from “David Holman’s
Diary,” the movie stars Rip Torn
as a psychiatrist “coming apart”
from reality and Sally Kirkland as
his mistress. A critic for Life com-
ments, “While it may or not have
been made in the spirit of art, it
has the effect of art—and very
troubling art at that.”

Jean Luc-Godard’s film ‘Sym-
pathy for the Devil” (1 plus 1 (April
10) stars the Rolling Stones de-
veloping the music of “Beggars
Banquet” to bizarre scenes and
off-scene voices quoting Le Roi
Jones, Stokley Carmichael, Eld-
ridge Cleaver, Hitler, etc, as a
comment on Black Power and the
state-of-the-revolution.

Pennsylvania’s Fiscal Situation
Threatens Student Scholarshi

By ROBERT WENDEL

, in the “state of the
ge presented by Pen-
’s Gov.-elect Milton Shapp,
mention was made of the possible
elimination of state aid to students
attending titutions of higher ed-

ucation, effective this semester

Although superficially of little
consequence, since the legislature
is the one who doles out the money,
the statements have initiated a
great deal of speculation on the
part of students and universities
alike.

The problem is compounded by
the fact that last year the state
was four months delinquent in pay-
ing the recipient institutions, and
the present outright admission of
financial hardship has caused some
out of state schools to simply de-
mand that those Pennsylvania stu-
dents affected pay out of their own
pocket or risk being dropped from
the school’s registration lists.

Even within the state the lack of
funds is causing some difficulty.
Penn State is especially hard hit,
and before the funds actually be-
come available, it is very possible
that a loss approaching one million
dollars could be realized by State.
This loss will come in the form of
interest due on the money that will
necessarily have to be borrowed in
order to keep the schools open.

As regards this University, Dean
John C. Hayward emphasized that

ABS Backs Motion,
Urges No Parietals

By PAMELA MAY

In its Wednesday meeting the As-
sociation of Bucknell Students pas-
sed a motion by Bob Nachshin con-
cerning visitation hours in the resi-
dence halls. It reads

“Until such time as the coed liv-
ing situation is eval ated by the
Dean of Student Affairs’ Office:

“The ABS requests that Presi-
dent Watts immediately eliminate
the University’s Parietal Hour re-
strictions d that, during the
period preceding the completion of
the Dean’s evaluation, each Living
Unit be empowered to determine
its own visitation policy.”

In his rationale, Nachshin stated
he found the present situation “un-
believable” ‘when ‘other schools
comparable to us—intellectually,
academically — have managed to
have twenty-four hour open dorms
and it’s worked very, very well.”

Apartheid and Polaroid

It is generally recognized that the
military is engaged in antisocial activi-
ties. However, it is most important to
note that most large-scale, non-military,
industry does as much to inhibit social
progress. Only very recently has indus-
try developed an attitude of “environ-
mental protection.” Of course, many
corporations, while extolling the bene-
fits of controlling pollution, still con-
tinue to pollute and to fight the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. There are
also other forms of antisocial behavior
in which big business engages.

Polaroid Corporation manufactures
instant color identification systems. A
present model, ID-2, takes two photo-
graphs: one of a person and one of an
identification document, and in sixty
seconds ejects a plastic ID card. This

is now being used in South

ca to produce fifteen million pass-

All blacks in the society must

carry these identification papers at all

times or be subject to arrest and prosecu-
tion.

Although Polaroid has registered
the demands of black workers who are
urging the discontinuation of ID-2 sales
to South Africa, Polaroid is still trying
to maintain a liberal corporate image.
On January 12 of this year full page

ads were taken out at, great expense in
several major papers including: New
York Times, Wall Street Journal, and
Washington Post as well as in twenty
black newspapers. The ad, entitled “An
Experiment in South Africa,” reported
that the company was trying to help
South African blacks. Since even the
Polaroid Corporation must abide by the
Apartheid policies, this claim is doubt-
ful. And, while Polaroid reports having
stopped sales of ID-2 to South Africa,
in actuality it sells the system to its
distributor, Frank and Hirsch Company,
which, in turn, sells ID-2 to South
Africa.

Science and technology are misused
in many ways. The exploitation of poor
nations and minority groups as well as
the environment can be ended. However,
strong public action is needed. One of
the most powerful weapons the consumer
has is his money. Unless firms are hit
where it hurts, antisocial behavior will
continue to proliferate in industry simply
because it is profitable.

The black workers of the Polaroid
Corporation have called for a worldwide
boycott of Polaroid products to force the
company to discontinue its sales of ID-2
to South Africa. We urge support of this
boycott.

have been a lucrative exchange of
ideas, opinions and facts, rapidly
degenerated into a contest in which
each participant tried to be the
most concerned person of the even-

glamorous solution to the world’s

Of course, when one tries to

most sane) things tend to be pass-

happened to the two most impor-

7 GUEST COLUMN

Jan Plan Faults

By CHARLES MUSSMAN,

, as last year, a certain proportion of students spent Jan-
wary doing a project which was most probably interesting, satisfying,
educational (whatever that means), and enjoyable. A greater proportion
of students spent the time vacationing, working, or finishing up the
courses they had left over from last semester. Those students who were
“officially registered” for projects and completed them satisfactorily
{so what can be unsatisfactory about a trip to Europe?) will have a
permanent record of their achievements placed on their transcripts (to
impress employers, graduate schools, and friends and neighbors).

Those students who loafed, finished up work that should have been
completed last semester, or had a heavy round of prospective graduate
schools or summer employers to visit will have no such record of their
actions during January on their transcripts. As most faculty and stu-
dents would agree, this is only fair. However, because of the bureau-
cratic nati of the way “‘official’’ Jan Plans are processed and recorded,
some students do not get a fair chance to have their transcripts em-
bellished. Here are two hypothetical examples of what can and probably
does happen.

In November a student registeres for the project in photography. He
decides to buy a fairly expensive Japanese camera—from a company
in Japan. He orders the camera early in December, but when he arrives
in January the camera is somewhere between Osaka and Lewisburg.
After waiting a few days, this student decides that since he is here he
might as well spend his time profitably while waiting for the camera,
and so he decides to sit in on a computer programming course. At the
end of January (when the camera arrives) this student knows BASIC
(a computer language) but gets an “‘unsatisfactory’’ in his photography
Jan Plan. He goes and explains his predicament to the registar fully
expecting everything to be OK. However, as most of you have already
guessed, he cannot get the computer course recorded on his transcript,
because he was not “officially registered’ for that course.

Meanwhile, another student is sitting at home “vacationing.” What
should arrive at his home but the Special Introductory Offer of the Book
of the Month Club: a ten volume set of the Story of Civilization by Prof.
Will Durant and his wife. So, having nothing special to do, this student
starts reading Our Oriental Heritage (the first volume; 1000-plus pages)
to see what it’s like. In two weeks he’s finished that and gone on to The
Life of Greece, which he also finishes. The student returns to campus
and during a conversation with his advisor happens to mention what he
did over January. The professor is intrigued, and asks the student why
he didn’t make that his January Program.

Of course, in neither of these cases could the student get any credit
for his work during January. It seems too bad that there can’t be some
sort of Jan Plan registration and evaluation “‘after the fact” for those
in special circumstances who feel that their intercession was spent in
a profitable endeavor.

with person after person suggest-
ing organized plans which would
express the concern of the entire
University, while I’m sure the Uni-
versity, as a whole, is not con-
cerned. The winning idea, which
was submitted with only half-serious
intentions, but which was loudly
accepted when people realized it
was getting late and they’d better
decide something in a hurry, was
to have 300 people march on the
Federal Building, armed with their
prepared statement to the press,
in the hopes of getting arrested.

Of course, the best idea of the
evening was completely overlooked
and ignored (and this is the second
point to which I referred). That
idea, a very old one, was for all
males to send back their draft
cards — an action which, to me,
shows more courage and more con-
cern than being arrested with 299
other people for loitering.

But, lest we forget the tone of
this meeting, we must realize that
300 people being arrested together
is much more glamorous than 300
individuals separately sending back
their draft cards. Besides, if you
put yourself in a group of 300
people who are supposed to be
concerned, you actually might start
believing it about yourself, too

Dispensary
To the Editor:

This letter is in regard to a re-
cent emergency situation which
was ignored by the Bucknell Dis-
pensary.

At six o’clock Sunday morning,
January 17, 1971, a call was made
to the infirmary requesting the
name of an oral surgeon in the
area. This call was made after the
student’s doctor at home had been
notified and had stressed the need
for immediate emergency treat-
ment. Treatment was needed for
bleeding of the mouth following
oral surgery, and at the time the
call was placed, the student had
been bleeding excessively for four
hours.

The reaction of the person on
duty at the infirmary was less than
satisfactory; first, by her insis-
tence that the student would not
be able to receive any help on Sun-
day, and secondly because, as she
stated, she was in bed. Her only
help was to name a dentist in
Lewisburg.

A call to Evangelical Hospital
was reacted to similarily. The stu-
dent’s next action was to call Gei-
singer Medical Center in Danville
where fortunately emergency treat-
ment was immediately and cheer-
fully administered.

This letter is to inform the Buck-
nell community that the services of
the Bucknell Dispensary are in-
adequate for the students’ needs.
It is also an appeal to the adminis-
tration for action to be taken at
once to rectify the situation where-

THE SIDESHOW

Vacation at Home

By DAVID WEINBERGER

‘Lenny passed the wine over. Lenny, with short hair and a bushy
beard, is into cheap wine instead of drugs. He has also stopped writing
poetry about anything except politics. Billy clubs and liberation are
broken up into lines by every punctuation mark, and Lenny calls them
poems.

When Lenny and I went to high school together, Lenny used to write
sloppy, sentimental poetry. He was the romantic, and I was the hard-
bitten realist. We would argue not about whether or not we would have
a fast against the War, but rather over why we should have the fast. He
was in favor of it because it would spiritually renew us; I was in favor of
it because it would prompt support of our other actions.

Then Lenny and almost all my other high school friends went to
Wisconsin University with 20,000 other students. Mike rolled up his over-
alls to show me the scar he received when he vaulted over a wall to
“escape the pigs’ during the riots at Wisconsin. He says he’s out of the
draft because of the injury. We all laughed because life is sometimes
funny like that.

I hadn’t seen my friends from high school for a year, so we thought
we'd have a lot to say to each other. But the way it worked out, 1
walked into their gathering by myself, kicking over a half-filled bottle
bottle of dollar wine. “You haven’t changed,” they said, so there was
nothing new that I could tell them.

Joe had switched to wire rims sometime during last year, and he
was smoking a cigarette. I’d never seen him smoke one before, or
maybe I had. No, I think not. He turned to me when I sat down next to
him, while the rest of the crowd talked about people that I didn’t know.
But Joe didn’t say anything. “How are you?” I asked. “Pretty good,”
he said after a moment of deliberation. “Good,” I said. We looked at
the wine bottles.

Coltrane

Joe is living with four other guys and three girls out on a farm.
When I knew him he was just a step past collecting baseball cards.

Jane and Kathy sat on the floor, legs crossed, calves stacked on
each other like pancakes, butter pat hair melting down. I looked at
them. Joe looked at the record player and said, “Coltrane,” a magic
word, the title of the book of my friends. I had to rely on one of my
most trusted magic words: I said, “Oh.”

Looking for a red wine, I sat down next to Fat Andy. He still had
gray dirt packed into the crease between his chins and his shoulders.
He told me that his rock and roll group was cutting a record and that
oh yes he had dropped out of school. Fat Andy had always been a good
blues guitarist, playing a hundred dollar red Hagstrom guitar, the ‘‘on-
off”? labels peeling off.

He told me that Marsha was married, but I didn’t remember who
Marsha was, until he reminded me that she was the star of our high
school play. He also told me about Bill, a friend who goes to Harvard.
In elementary school Bill thought that he was a dinosaur. Now he’s
going into psychological warfare.

I asked Lenny how he was, expecting to find out about his grades,
his courses, his sex life. He said, ‘Well, I’m living out on a farm now
and it’s beautiful. I’m finding out how beautiful people can be, how you
can love people in a way that keeps on growing. We’re out there all
alone with 200 acres for our back yard, with ducks and geese and goats.
And a turtle named Smarks. We helped a neighbor slaughter a pig last
week. I’m just out there reading and writing an awful lot. Writing a lot.
And I’m in love with a girl out there. What a beautiful chick. I’ve never
felt so wonderful or so strong. I feel like I’m ready to take on anything.”

He didn’t stop once, or pause. A used-car salesman talk. But maybe
not. Who am I to evaluate Lenny’s life? But then again, how can I
evaluate mine when it has been called into question by talks like
Lenny’s, without evaluating his? I gave up and realized that Lenny and
I are not the same people.

The day before I had gone back to my high school as the day
emptied and the halls were clearing. I didn’t know anyone except for
a few teachers. And with them, how can I know how to stand when I
speak, or how many curse words I’m allowed? The gravel voice of the
assistant principal excused the students from work day #76, and I drove
home behind the filled yellow busses.

Lenny and Joe and Andy haven’t gone back to our high school. When
I left the party we had to shake hands instead of just waving.

American Arms
To the Editor:

Only today (January 29, 1971) did
I see the December 11, 1970 issue
of The Bucknellian, which carried
a letter by Andrew Higgins at-
tempting to refute my column deal-
ing with national defense.

Mr. Higgins claims I used false
statistics, and quotes from the
Scientific American in his attempt
to prove that contention. There is
actually no significant difference
between my statistics and those Mr.
Higgins quotes.

My article said the U.S. has 1,000
small ICBMS and 54 early model
ICBMs (there was a printing error
in The Bucknellian, not in the
mimeographed text of my column
that turned 1,000 into 100), totalling
1,054, the identical figure offered
by Scientific American.

As did Scientific American, I said
the U.S. had 656 submarine based
missiles. I gave figures that would
total 1100 ICBMs for the USSR,
while Scientific American gives a
figure of 250 more missiles for
them than that. Scientific American
said the USSR had 205 sub-based
missiles, I said 280

The Scientific American article
appeared in January 1970. My
source was a U.S. News and World
Report article of October 19, 1970.
so I suggest that my more current
statistics account for the difference
there.

Higgins neglects to include in his
comparison the 300 sub launched
cruise missiles of the Soviets that
I mentioned in my article (these
are missiles a sub launches after
surfacing), and gives the mislead-
ing statistic that the U.S. has 2,144
bombers to Russia’s 600. That latter
statistic is accurate only if one
counts medium range and tactical

bombers, which I specifically did
not mention in my article. Most of
these bombers could not reach the
Soviet Union unless stationed in
Europe or Asia, and many of them
are not armed with nuclear weap-
ons.

In sum, the great differences Mr.
Higgins would like the reader to
believe exist between his figures
and mine are really not so great,
and my figures are the more cur-
rent and more directly relevant to
nuclear strength.

Mr. Higgins throws in MIRVs in
a further attempt at refutation. He
assumes that we will continue to
deploy MIRVs despite significant
opposition from liberals and the
left. I hope he is correct, but even
so, as he points out, the USSR
also has MIRV capabilities.

It should also be noted that war-
heads vary in strength, and the
Soviets are far ahead of us in the
deployment of large warheads. The
megatonnage of such a Soviet war-
head has a destructive power equal
to several of ours.

Finally, Mr. Higgins describes
ULMS, another new weapons sys-
tem, evidently to indicate that we
will continue our strategic lead.
What he neglects to mention is that
ULMS is only in the first stages of
development and a long way from
actual Congressional approval for
deployment. If and when it is ap-
proved I will feel much less con-
cerned about the state of our na-
tional defense, but I am more than
a little afraid that those of Mr.
Higgins like will be opposing, not
supporting, deployment of ULMS.

Dear Editor,

Many of your readers are un-
wittingly jeopardizing their further
education. I am referring to those
students who are currently apply-
ing, via LSDAS, to law schools, and
in general to anyone required to
register with the Educational Test-
ing Services in Princeton, New
Jersey.

For those unfamiliar with the law

school application process, let me
explain. Most schools require that
the student’s Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) and his transcript be
handled by the Law School Data
Assembly Service (LSDAS), a
branch of the Educational Testing
Services (ETS). Ostensibly LSDAS
“analyzes” your transcript and
sends their analysis along with
your LSAT score to the law schools
to which you are applying. All this
is intended in the interests of ef-
ficiency, expediency, and standard-
ization.

In October of last year I took the
LSAT, and on December 23rd my
college transcript was sent to
LSDAS. On February 4th I received
a notice from one of the schools
to which I had applied. The notice
informed me that they had not re-
ceived my LSDAS materials. This
was 6 weeks after the last of my
materials had been sent to ETS. I
called them immediately, demand-
ing to know the reasons behind the

delay. I was told that a computer
malfunction was hampering the
assembly of the records of many
students who had taken the LSAT
in October. (The majority of law
applicants take the test in October.)
I was told that the problems
“should be remedied within a
week.”

There are implications far be-
yond the mere inconvenience which
this may have caused myself and
others. Law schools, unlike under-
graduate institutions, follow a
policy whereby applications are re-
viewed periodically; invitations or
rejections may be sent out at vir-
tually any time during the appli-
cant’s senior year. The student
whose application is received late
is at a distinct disadvantage, for
the chance of a higher caliber ap-
plication being received by the
school increases as the deadline
approaches.

Even more questionable than the
mere handling of the materials is

Concert Committee’s Problems

(Continued from Page 1)
by telephone usually occurs some-
time after the conventions.

Most groups’ concerts are sche-
duled through agencies in New
York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and
Los Angeles. Meyer has negotiated
with most groups from the phone
in his room. Although the concert
committee is offically part of ABS,
it has no separate office.

Meyer notes that negotiations and
scheduling of acts usually take five
months. First semester concerts
must be booked in the summer;
second semester bookings are set-
tled in the winter. At the final
spring concert there will be a
table at which students may ex-
press their preferences for next
year’s acts.

Economically, the concert com-
mittee is usually able to ‘‘break
even.” Meyer expects to lose
money on some concerts and make
up the difference on the others.

Approximately 85% of sales is
season tickets. Meyer regards this
advance volume selling as why the
University’s concert series has re-
mained so successful. Due to profits
last year, the committee was able
to stage a free concert with Jam
Factory

Meyer also mentions that the

mixed feelings as to their own mo-
tives for acting. A perhaps not un-
typical comment was the one of a
marcher who said, ‘I’m not sure
its accomplishing what its supposed
to.” The gentleman next to him
returned, ‘What is it supposed to
do.”

The march had been agreed on
at a mass meeting held Tuesday
night in Vaughan Literature Audi-
torium. Prof. Jerome Rinyus de-
livered an opening speech outlining
the intelligence operations of the
U.S. in Vietnam. In conclusion, he
asked that the least anyone could
do in response to the Laos invasion
was to ‘“‘convince one other person
that killing other men is wrong.”

Rick Beardsley then attempted
to guide the open discussion among
the approximately three hundred
attending the meeting. It was hoped
that the group would develop an ap-
propriate course of action for the
following day

For the next hour, various points
were raised ranging from sugges-

tions to shovel sidewalks to a chal-
lenge for the “truly committed”
to burn the draft files at the local
board office.

Frustration abounded, and Beard-
sley was led at one point to plead,
“Lets just take a vote on some-
thing.”” Karl Patten suggested the
march which was carried out the
next day,

The following is the protest state-
ment of the marchers:

We, individual members of the
Bucknell community, protest the
mounting inhumanity of our gov-
ernment. We are here today to
express our outrage at the
American-directed invasion of
Laos, which we regard as yet
another immoral and illegal ac-
tion of our government in South-
east Asia. But we realize that
Laos is essentially a foreign ver-
sion of our domestic disregard
for human life and liberty, a
disregard which has exploded in
violence and repression across
the land. Standing here we affirm
that life and liberty and ask that
all men join us.

Let’s Get It Straight

CRIME PAYS—PLENTY

Question: You hear it said

that crime doesn’t pay, but

some people seem to get away with a lot in this world. How

come?

Answer: This question has bothered people for thousands

of years. Long ago in the day.

of the Prophet Jeremiah we

find him asking, “Wherefore does the way of the wicked
prosper?” We find the answer in the Bible also: it is be-
cause of God’s mercy that He does not strike the sinner
down the moment:he sins. He gives him every opportunity
to change his ways. And He often leaves him. in the full en-
joyment ‘of his worldly prosperity, because it is not always
in His plan to render judgment in this life.

e
You may have heard of the

farmer who plowed his field
on Sunday, sowed it with seed
on Sunday, cultivated and
weeded it on Sunday, reaped
it on Sunday, and even sold
the grain on Sunday. He
twitted his more godly neigh-
bor with the fact that his ac-
counting showed that his
field had yielded more profit
than his neighbor’s. “Yes,”
said the neighbor, “but God
hasn't. closed His account
book yet.”

We are to love God, not for
the material prosperity He
allows us to enjoy, but for

Himself alone, for the joy
that knowing and ‘obeying
Him brings to our hearts.

When a rich man in the
Bible died and went to hell,
Abraham reminded him from
paradise that in his lifetime
he ‘had received his good
things, yet had not loved God
or his neighbor. Now he had
no cause of complaint against
God. When it comes to a
choice of laying up treasures
in heaven or treasure on
earth, only the short-sighted
will choose the latter. The
former will last for eternity.

leadership of the concert commit-
tee has remained the same in the
past few years. “A very small
group is most effective in negotia-
tions of this sort,” he asserts. “I
look on the concert committee as
a ‘conelike’ organization. Months
before the concert only one or two
work on a show; by concert time,
nearly 80 people may be involved
in publicity, ticket sales, and ad-
vertising.”’

Gebauer foresees a “much broad-
er’ concert committee next year.
Director of public relations at
WVBU, he will work with Steve
Selinger, former music director
for WVBU, and Keith Coughey, as
well as others.

Upon graduation Meyer will
utilize his experience with concert
scheduling. As a professional “‘en-
tertainment specialist,” he will at-
tempt to schedule acts for various
colleges. He claims, “Colleges must
realize that concerts are not merely
activities, they are business.”

Pa. Drops Aid

(Continued from Page 1)
if the money isn’t appropriated by
May 1.

The first one is that the school
will need the money by then for
operating expenses, which would
seem to indicate the possibility that
the University might have to bor-
row. Or, since it is unlikely that
anyone in the Business & Finance
Office would like paying off the in-
terest on such a loan, with the pre-
sent $300,000-plus deficit from last
year still over their heads, the stu-
dents might just have to come up
with the money themselves.

Another disaster coukd be even
more troublesome. What about the
seniors who must have their bills
paid in order to receive their di-
plomas? At the present time there
are between 50 to seniors who
could be affected by the present
dilemma, which seems unlikely to
be resolved in the near future.

Although, for the University, the
problem has not, as yet, reached
any serious proportions, the statis-
tics tell the extent to which the
University could be affected: num-
ber of students receiving PHEAA
aid—300: total number of awards—
$116,000/sem.

With any kind of real austerity
program initiated by the legislature

ania, a goodly number
of students could find themselves
searching around for an extra $400,
or even worse, they might find
such a task impossible.

Improvements Needed

Series of Medical Errors, Including an ‘Emergency’
Expose Serious Inadequacies at Ziegler Dispensary

By DAVID HAMMER

Investigation suggests that the
Ziegler Dispensary may be taking
a turn for the worse. At least three
cases of persons needing medical
help from this university's dis-
pensary resulted in what could be
termed ‘“‘less than adequate’’ as-
sistance

For example, freshman Ed Hafer
experienced relative  disillusion-
ment on the Saturday and Sunday
of Homecoming Weekend last se-
mester when he suffered from a
broken jaw after being “mugged”
in Lewisburg by non-university stu-
dents. Having been informed that
Evangelical Community Hospital
“would not take X-rays,’ Hafer was
forced to seek assistance from
Ziegler dispensary on the after-
noon following the incident

Hafer asked for the doctor and
was told that he ‘would be in
later.’’ Consequently, he returned
that evening and informed the
nurse on duty that he had come
again to seek the doctor’s help.
While Hafer was waiting for him
to appear, broken jaw and all,
several people came in and out;
unfortunately, one of the ones who
Jeft the dispensary was the doctor
himself.

Because Hafer did not know the
doctor and because, evidently, the
physician had not been told of
Hafer’s presence by the nurse, the
freshman had to suffer yet another
day until an appointment could be
made with the dispensary, on Mon-
day.

‘Sprained Fracture’

In another incident, Gene Bar-
tholomew (Hafer’s roommate) suf-
fered what was later diagnosed as
a “sprained fracture” from playing
basketball in mid-December of last
year. The doctor on the afternoon
shift at Ziegler Dispensary, atter

remarking that he “really didn’t
think X-rays needed to be taken”
(as Hafer recalls his words), sug-
gested that the best thing Bar-
tholomew could do would be to
“walk on it.’ And, so, he did. All
would have been fine had his in-
jury merely beén a sprain (and,
without X-rays, such seemed the
case); however, had X-rays been
taken, Bartholomew would not have
been walking on the fracture and,
certainly, treatment would have
commenced immediately.

Dental Dilemma

Yet another situation arises from
a letter submitted to The Bucknell-
ian in which Annett Lord recalls
her experience with Ziegler Dis-
pensary on January 7 of this year.
She had had wisdom teeth re-
moved at home and, although the
stitches were still in, she was ad-
vised that she could return to
school. At approximately 3 am.,
on January 7, she awoke to find
her mouth bleeding and, finally,
asked her friend, (Nadeen Van
Tuyle) to call her home; Lord’s
dentist, from an account of the
situation, described her condition
as warranting ‘emergency treat-
ment.”

On these grounds, van Tuyle
contacted Evangelical Community
Hospital; the nurse on duty ex-
plained that van Tuyle should call
the University dispensary, instead
despite the ‘“‘emergency treatment”
analysis and the fact that only
three days earlier the hospital had
initiated a program whereby an
or, surgeon would be on call 24
hours a day. (Evidently, as Annette
Lord suggests, only those “higher
up” in the hospital echelon knew
of this action involving the oral
surgeon continuously on call.)

It happened that the Ziegler Dis-
pensary, in this instance, was less

than helpful despite Miss Lord’s
continued bleeding. The nurse on
duty would only supply names of
dentists in the area and, more
significantly to Miss Lord, freely
advised that contacting area den-
tists “would not be much help”
due to the fact that it was Sunday.
Finally, out of what must be termed
sheer desperation, Miss Lord was
driven to Geisinger Medical Center
by friends and was eventually taken
care of—only after much blood had
been lost due to the seeming—run-
around by both Evangelical Com-
munity Hospital and the Ziegler
Dispensary early on a Monday
morning

Several questions and suggestions
arise in the minds of those in-
volved in these isolated, yet re-
lated, incidents. Annette Lord ad-
mitted that panic was a factor in
her uation, and that the Ziegler
nurse did not help to “‘instill con-
fidence’’ with the remark that pro-
bably no help could be found at
such an early hour. Also, the
nurse at Ziegler did ‘‘not,” in Miss
Lord’s words, ‘‘seem to compre-

‘Groove Tube’
Satirizes TV

By KARL BLAKE

“Groove Tube,’”’ a new theatre
form in which the only actor is a
television set, will be here Wednes-
day, February 17, sponsored by
the Bucknell Concert Committee.

There will be continuous show-
ings at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 pm. Ad-
mission is $

Created by Kenny Shapiro, a
former television performer, ‘‘Gro-
ove Tube” is a two-hour collection
of satirical sketches, musical num-
bers and take-offs on television
commercials, which the theatre
audience views on three television
monitors on the stage.

Shapiro, with the help of friend
Lane Sarasohn, wrote and directed
the sketches and operated the
cameras and recording equipment.
He also acted in several of the
pieces.

When the show proved to be a
success at the Channel One Theater

New York’s East Village, he
made another copy of the tape for
circulation on college campuses.

Shapiro uses satiric techniques
of exaggeration and unexpected
juxtap ns. Thus, a pornographic
film is supplied with a running
commentary by two television
sportcas' with skin flick and
sports ers both being satirized.

Shapiro says, somewhat expan-
sively, of his videotape theatre:
‘This is my definitive comment
on television, and on life.”

‘Catch-22’ Flick Fails in Attempt
To Recreate Heller’s War Novel

By LOU BUCCERI

About fifteen years ago, Joseph Heller wrote a book called Catch-22.
It was about life and death and war and a million other things which
people have been writing about for centuries. The beauty of Heller’s
work was that it forced you to laugh uproariousty while simultaneously
experiencing a sickening feeling in the pit of your stomach. This com-
bination of emotions is the effect of what is known in some circles as
‘Black Comedy.’ In other circles this experience is known as ‘being alive.’
Whatever it’s called, Heller's effort in Catch-22 was outstanding.

About a year and a half ago, Mike Nichols began directing a film
based on Heller’s book. Nichols is a well known, much honored director,
with films such as The Graduate to his credit. He hired a crew of actors;
among them Orson Welles, Jon Voight, Alan Arkin, Bob Newhart, Art
Garfunkle and, as they say, a host of others.

To give this worthy cast a noble set, Nichols rented a valley in one
of the most desolate parts of Mexico. Since the book centers on a bomber
squadron in World War Il, Nichols gathered up bits and pieces to form
a fleet of B-25’s. He had the fleet restored to flying condition and flew
them to his Mexican valley, landing them on the full scale air strip
he had built there

At the same time, the well known writer and actor, Buck Henry,
was putting the final touches on the screen play adaptation of Heller’s
book. Nichols’ production co: ran into the millions of dollars. Pre-
premier publicity was heavy—everything from a cover story in Life
magazine to an article in Playboy.

All over the country, Heller freaks were impatiently waiting to see
if Nichols’ extravaganza would faithfully translate the book experience
into a movie experience. Catch-22 (the novel) had become a kind of
Bible for some of us, and to be able to see and hear it, instead of just
mind-picturing it, would have been fantastic. Unfortunately, Nichols
didn’t make it.

Catch-22 is a bad movie. It isn’t the acting, or the setting, or the
photography that is bad; it’s the script and the direction. Nichols and
Henry turned Catch-22 into a scattered series of incoherent vignettes.
Heller’s book was by no means linear, but it was definitely coherent.

Alan Arkin could have played the lead character, Captain Yossarian,

credibly, but the script forces him to portray Yossarian as two separate
people—first completely crazy, then, suddenly, completely sane. Heller’s
Yossarian is crazy, But it’s his insanity that saves him. He reacts in-
sanely to an insane environment, since behaving in a way which the en-

In the book, the author’s belief in the correctness of Yossarian’s
position is revealed by a gradual but forceful exposition of his situation.
In the movie, that situation is thrown at us all at once, making it im-
possible to understand what’s going on, let alone why it’s happening.

To allow this compression to occur, Nichols eliminates some characters
and exaggerates others, creating an atmosphere of Good vs. Evil com-
pletely alien to Heller’s book. Nichols kills off characters he hasn’t even
introduced simply because their deaths are picturesque. He suddenly
abondons characters he has just begun to develop, giving the feeling
that Yossarian is wandering among cardboard figures.

The character of Milo Minderbinder is first made central to the
story line, but is then perverted into the role of a Static-Hitler figure.
Heller’s Milo was clever, enterprising, and sick, but by no means
demonic. The movie boils Yossarian’s battle for life down to an imagin-
ary fight against imaginary demons.

Nichols’ movie takes a complex book concerning a complex situation
and crushes it, leaving a worthless cartoon of life. It may well be that no
movie could faithfully reproduce the atmosphere of Heller’s book.
Certainly no movie that had to end after two and one-half hours. Catch-22
is long and involved. Each minute part is important to the whole. Un-
fortunately, minor actions and gestures are often lost amid a film’s dia-
logue and camera work.

Perhaps film can present the dilemma treated in Catch-22, However,
it must first evolve its own story-line, its own characters, and make use
of its own peculiar methods. Nichols’ attempt is a choppy. incoherent
waste, impossible to understand without having read the book, and
horribly inadequate after having read it.

Thinclads Place in Relay Events;

By JEFF QUINZER

Improvement is the goal all
coaches strive for as a season
progresses. The progress of the
winter track team, and that of the
two-mile relay team in particular,
would please the most demanding
of coaches.

In the recent Knights of Colum-
bus Track Meet at Madison Square
Garden on Feb. 5, the relay team
of Paul Hermly (2:02.2), John Lar-
ner (1:58.9), Rich Francel (1:56.8),
and Tom Hagerty (2:01.5), ran a
7:59.4 relay which bettered their
times of the two previous weeks by
16 and 22 seconds respectively, and
was their best effort of the year,
good enough for a fifth place finish.

The fine showing eliminated one
problem for Coach Arthur Gulden:
whether or not the team should
travel to Baltimore the next morn-
ing for the All-Eastern Invitational.

“We were debating whether to go

or not,” explained Gulden. ‘It was

The decision to compete on Sat-
urday was obviously a good one,
as the team responded with an
8:01.2 time and a second place fin-
ish in their section. They were
topped only by the powerful Balti-
more Olympic Club, an AAU team
of graduate runners. In the process,
they downed Seton Hall, Catholic
University, and Virginia State.

Coach Gulden was obviously
pleased about the second place fin-
ish. “We beat a good team in
Seton Hall, who has run a 7:56, by
15 yards. That’s an important com-
petitive aspect. When you run on
a slow track like the one in Balti-
more, times don’t mean a thing. It
depends on who you beat.”

How did the squad react to run-
ning in such prestigious places as
the Garden and Civic Center?

‘Tt was a fantastic feeling,” re-
plied Francel. “Here we were, on

Fencing Found Fun

By DAN MILLER

It can be used to defend your
honor as well as that of your lady.
The techniques have been handed
down since the days of Cyrano de
Bergerac and the thrill of a deft
parry and adroit reoste still courses
in every noble man’s veins.

The sport is fencing, and it was
initiated at BU the opening week
in January as a one week workshop
under the leadership of Professor
Ken Kaminski of the Math Depart-
ment.

Professor Kaminski, an alumnus
of Rutgers University, competed in
intercollegiate fencing while an
undergraduate. He very willingly
compiled to a request to instruct
interested people in the rudiments
of fencing as a part of the January
Program.

The turnout was unexpectedly
large and enthusiastic and what
was originally slated to be a one-

week program was extended to
daily workouts for the remainder
of the month.

With the end of January it was
decided to attempt to combine the
organized practices on a one-per-
week basis during the semester.

In addition efforts are being
made to contact other schools to
investigate the possibility of organ-
izing intercollegiate matches.

While the fencers who are cur-
rently participating in the club are
enthusiastic, the element of com-
petitive experience is lacking.
Coach Kaminski is the only swords-
man who is familiar with the com-
petitive aspects of the sport.

Therefore, any fencers on the
faculty or in the student body who
are interested in returning to com-
petition are invited to attend the
Wednesday night workouts. They
are scheduled for 7:00 in Tustin
Gym and the equipment is pro-
vided.

decided that if the boys ran well in
New York, we would go.”

the same level as the guys you
always read about. They came over
and talked to us and everything.”

John Larner was also impressed
“Tt was a whole different atmos-
phere,’ he said. ‘Everything
seemed different; just seeing those
thousands of people in the stands
was really scary.”

“] think it gave us more confi-
dence and a lot of experience,”
added Hermly.

The following is a recap of the
meets in January.

Pittsburgh (Jan. 16): Larner,
Hagerty and Hermly finished first,
third and fourth respectively in the
1,000. Fred Weber took a first in
the 600 while Francel ran a 1:55.2
to place second in the invitational
half-mile. Len Dillinger finished
third in the high jump and fourth
in the long jump.

Philadelphia (Jan. 23): ‘‘The two-
mile relay team had a bad day and
finished fourth out of six teams,”
explained Gulden.

Cornell Invitational (Jan. 30):
Hermly (1:17.9) finished third in
the jayvee 600 while Larner placed
fifth in the mile with a 4:35, his
best time ever. Francel, returning
from a two-week injury, took fifth
in the 1,000.

The freshman medely relay of
Bill Ledgerwood, Rick Bullock,
Randy Mattison and Bob Lucas
finished third. Bullock was also
first in the 600 and Mattison finish-
ed fourth in the high jump at 58.

Coach Gulden is optimistic about
the future. “We have showed im-
provement and will continue to im-
prove, as long as we keep work-
ing,” he said.

“We're now looking forward to
the Delaware Invitational on the
26th and 27th,” concluded Gulden.
“Reaction to the team so far has
been very favorable. I’ve had many
compliments from opposing coaches
and meet directors. We will be in-
vited to these meets again next
year.”

Bullets Beat Baby Bisons;
Engineers Invading Davis

By ALAN GROCHAL

A spectacular 25 point perform-
ance for BU’s Paul Kerr was off-
set by Gettysburg’s balanced attack
as the Bullet frosh romped BU 86-
67, Tuesday.

Kerr, who fouled out late in the
game, scored 19 points in the first
half to bring the Bisons to within 2
points of the Bullets at intermis-
sion, 46-44.

The Herd went ahead 48-47 early
in the second half, but Gettysburg
streaked ahead to a 14 point lead
shortly afterward.

Five Bullet players scored in
double figures with Perry Clark
leading the way with 24.

Algin Garrett supported Kerr’s
offensive show with 16 points of
his own.

The defeat dropped the Bisons
record to 8-5 and shattered a four
game winning streak.

The Thundering Herd made a
spirited comeback in the game
after being down early. Gettysburg
ran off 12 straight points to start
the game. The Bullets came out in
a full court press which forced
several Bison turnovers.

Weekend action should provide a
stiff test for the freshman cagers.

Lehigh invades Davis Gym, Fri-
day, in what points to a revenge
match for the Baby Bisons. BU

Frosh Coach Tommy Thompson
has an added incentive. Thompson
has never beaten the Lehigh fresh-
men in his six years at the school.

Saturday, the Thundering Herd
travels to Lafayette for a tough
road game. Last week the Bisons
defeated the Lafayette frosh 61-52,
but on the Leopards’ home court a
victory will be more difficult.

high is one team Carter really
wants to beat, especially after Le-
high’s victory in double-overtime
over the Herd earlier this season.

The toughest Bison foe, in Har-
vey’s opinion, was Syracuse with
their 6-11 center, who gave the
team a real tough time. However,
there is still the promising thought
that Syracuse will play without
their giant next year, while BU
will return all but two players.

Admitte it was a rough mid-
dle of the season schedule for the
Blue, but even though it got
tougher to get up for the games
as the lo: streak lengthened,
Carter notes that ‘No one wanted
to quit, all the guys stayed with
it.”

While quick to point out that this
year’s season is far from over,
Harvey voiced his belief that the
Bisons will be a team to reckon
with in the future. He is really
looking forward to playing with the
freshmen who will be moving up
next year” as well as this year’s
sophomores. The  frosh squad

seems to be ‘‘working well together
and could help us next year.” He
also remarked that a frosh victory
always helped to psych the varsity
squad for their game to follow.
The big center feels that the
team is constantly learning to play
t ther, and in two years a lot
can happen to a team. He credits
Bucknell’s victories to ‘‘five guys
all playing together,” rather than
individual performances and backs
this up by noting the evenly dis-
tributed scoring totals for the Bi-
son attack
Harvey has set high goals for
himself and the team. He hopes to
win MAC titles the next two years
and to get to the NIT before he
graduates from BU. To some, such
a prediction is improbable, to
others, an understatement, but to
those who have watched, cheered
and followed Bison basketball this
r, these words must hold a
se for the future. Indeed the
Big Blue will be a power to reckon
with in the future led by such
talented athletes as Harvey Carter

By ALAN GROCHAL

BU’s varsity cagers carry an 8-10
record into tonight’s game against
Lehigh. The Herd will be trying to
avenge a 2 point loss in triple over-
time incurred earlier in the sea-
son.

Lehigh features the leading re-
bounder in the MAC Western Sec-
tion in 67” Greg Falkenbach. The
Engineers also have guard John
Waters who is averaging over 17
points a game.

Last Tuesday the Bisons whipped
Gettysburg 74-63 behind the strong
scoring and rebounding of sopho-
more Harvey Carter to break a
seven game losing streak.

Carter, who scored 22 points, was
also an intimidating figure on de-
fense with several blocked shots.
He is currently averaging 14.1
points per game.

Despite Carter’s heroics, the
ferd only led by 3 points at inter-
mission, 35-32. They increased their
advantage to at least -10 points
throughout most of the second
period. Gettysburg managed a drive
however, late in the game, to pull
to within 5 with a minute left.

Switching to a spread-type of-
fense, the Bisons forced the Bullets
to gamble and consequently scored
3 layups to ice the game.

Dave Greenwood and Paul Biko
scored 14 and 13 points respectively
for the Herd. Chris Riley added 11,

‘World of Possibilities’

By ED MARSTON

The Class of 1956 Lecture was de-
livered Monday evening by Dr. J.
Ernest Keen, professor of psy-
chology. The lecture was entitled

«Toward a Psychology of Passi-
bility.”

The lecture was well-attended, so
much so that the overflow crowd
caused the lecture to be moved
from a classroom in Coleman Hall
to Olin Science Auditorium.

Keen presented a radical new ap-
proach to conciousness, articulated
in terms of a world of possibilities
as opposed to a world of actual-
ities, and he talked about the im-
plications of such an approach for
science and for human relations.

He began by saying that science,
and psychology in particular, is
grounded in the belief that natural
laws can be discovered by the rig-
orous application of scientific
method to the question of truth or
falsity. Therefore the scientist asks
“how?” and believes that gradual
elimination of error will yield the
essence of the system being in-
vestigated. In believing that there
“s a singular, correct answer the
scientist searches for “‘actualities.”

This approach, according to Keen,
necessarily excludes another entire-
ly different way of looking at man
and the world—as possibilities
rather than actualities.

He suggested that one look at an-
other person not to see him as he
is, but “to see him as he could be
or should be.” This involves a basic
restructuring of consciousness a-
round a revised theory of truth.

The theory of possibilities recog-
nizes that the only thing that is
true about the world is the ex-
istence of other possibilities, Form-
ative judgements become irrele-
vant when it is clear that the es-
sence of what a person or thing is
lies in what he or it could become.

For example, when the clinical

Dr. Lyons

psychologist deals with a mentally
troubled person he can regard his
patient’s personal world as either
a misperceived or insane world, or
he can treat it instead as a pos-
sible world in which one might live.
In the later case the therapist
makes no moral judgment about
the validity of his patient’s ex-
perience and himself makes no
claim to normalcy.

The question then becomes not
whether the experience of the pati-
ent is right or wrong, but whether
he can live comfortably with his
experience. If not, then treatment
would consist of exploring other
possible works.

In speaking about the therapist’s
relationship to the patient Keen
said, “To find him incomprehen-
sible is to confirm his actuality and
deny his possibility.” That is, if
the patient is made to believe that
he is only what he is seen to be,
sick or insane, then has no basis on
which to choose among different
possible mental states.

Keen went on to say that the
goals of a science of possibilities
would be to explore different ways

‘Monster Manunkind’

By G. PETE BALAKIAN

Dr. Will Lyons, professor of eco-
nomics at Franklin and Marshall
College and a ’39 graduate of the
University, spoke here Thursday
night on the topic of our present
economic revolution; the changes
it is inducing now and its possible
consequences in the future.

Professor Lyons began his lecture
with the implicit claim that there
is in our present situation an eco-
nomic basis for a large-scale social
change. Lyons emphatically stated,
“Anyone who can remain calm in
the present situation just doesn’t
understand it.”

Whereas change in the past has
always been gradual and often not
even noticable in one’s lifetime,
today change is occurring at such
a®¥rapid pace that people cannot

Deadline Approaches
For Spanish Holiday

By JUNE HEISTAND

In early December, James Ham-
merlee, Director of Student Pro-
grams, attended the National En-
tertainment Conference in New
York. While there, Group Travel
Associates, Inc., Chicago, Illinois,
was recommended as a reputable
and inexpensive travel service. Be-
cause of the concern over legiti-
mate charter flights since the
ps gy Digest report to consum-

(January), Mr. Hammerlee ob-
pai a second recommendation
from the Federal Aviation Agency.
With their approval, a spring vaca-
tion to “Costa del Sol’”’ is now avail-
able to the University’s students,
staff, faculty, and their immediate
families.

even keep up with it.

“Technology has improved faster
than its people,”’ Lyons stated, “‘and
it is on this basis that people are
slowly becoming obsolete.’’ Past
history has been marked by a cer-
tain economic stability which based
itself upon the reality that the
trade or occupation learned in one’s
youth would suffice as a means of
economic subsistence for one’s en-
tire lifetime.

This is not so today, for with our
rapid technological advance, one
man may have to reorient his life
style several times in the course
of his life, and for many people
this will be difficult, if not im-
possible.

Thus, society finds itself gravitat-
ing toward a two-class system;
those who are superfluous, and
those who are within the system.
The class of superfluous people has
evolved over the course of the
twentieth century. The process of
typing individuals to machinery
which they have no control over
has become an institution of our
modern society. There is no pride
or workmanship left only the bore-
dom of sitting and watching the
job go by.

Lyons stated, “If you can point
with pride to what you have done,
it becomes meaningful, but on an
assembly line this does not exist.”
Therefore, many people are sinking
into a state of anonimity and our
technology is presently wasting
many lives.

However, the situation is only
progressing in a declivous manner

ABS Offers Scholarships
Conferences Probe Interaction and Involvement

By TERRY ELLIS

“Human Interaction” and “‘Stu-
dent Involvement in the Univers-
ity’ are the two national con-
ferences to be attended by Uni-
versity representatives, under the
sponsorship of the ABS Conference
Committee.

Selected in accordance with the
goal of “social good” established
by the committee, these confer-
ences will accommodate approxi-
mately eight students. Applications
to attend are open to the entire
campus, while according to com-
mittee guidelines, the personal se-
lection of representatives will be
“in keeping with consideration of
the ‘social good’ as potential con-
ferees are evaluated on the basis
of the manner in which they will
be able to enrich the University
with the experience gained by at-
tending the conference.”

“Human Interaction,” sponsored
by the NTL Institute for Applied
Behavioral Sciences, convenes on
Feb. 26-28 at their conference cen-
ter at Stony Point, New York. This
organization has established a
series of weekend laboratories
focusing on one topic ranging from
“Being a Liberated Woman” to
“Community Development.”

The purpose of the “Human In-
teraction” seminar is to aid people

in more fully realizing their po-
tential to have productive and sat-
isfying relationships. Through be-

havioral reactions to their own

social system, the conferees ex-

amine their individual contribu-
tion to relationships.

In response to what benefit this
individualized experience would

have for the University, Pete

Holmes, chairman of the commit-
tee stated, “The committee views
this conference as a kind of scholar-
ship. Just by sharing the new know-
ledge they’ve gained, they will add
to the University community. It’s
the kind of thing an individual
couldn’t afford himself, but with
funds from the committee he would
have the opportunity.”

Possibly four people could at-
tend, with the committee paying
for tuition and conference fees and
the individuals paying a share for
food, lodging, and transportation.

The second conference, “National
Conference on Student Involvement
in the University”, is sponsored by
Northwestern University and Bowl-
ing Green University on March 5
and 6. Operating under the theme
“In Common Cause,” the confer-
ence will respond to the increased
student participation in the Uni-
versity structure, and will ‘“‘discuss
problems and propose new pro-
grams and solutions in working with
the administration, alumni, and
other members of the university
community.”

This conference has direct bear-
ing upon student organizations,
especially ABS, at the University.
Again, four students will be chosen
to attend this conference.

Two Views on Protest Psychology Lecture

The mass protest march last Wednesday was a self-defeating,

ineffectual gesture as far as “doing something” to end the War.
Different criteria may be used to evaluate the march. The follow-
ing two editorials present different points of view concerning the

validity of various forms of protest.

‘Effectiveness’ of Demonstration

Constructive Action?

The recent invasion of Laos made
most of us feel that some type of “2
tion” was necessary to protest this new-
est disregard for human life. We had to
“do something.” Some of us acted on
this impulse and demonstrated in front
of the Federal Office Building in Lewis-
burg. Did this demonstration really ac-
complish anything constructive?

If we want to end this war in a way
that won’t allow a new war to develop
somewhere else, we must broaden our
idea of “action.” Thinking and living
purposefully are constructive forms of
action just as much as demonstrating is,
although the former may sometimes be
mistaken as apathy.

A concern for effectiveness is shared
by both the demonstrators and the Nixon
Administration. The question we should
be asking ourselves js: should “‘effective-
ness” be a valid measure for our actions?
Should we do what is most effective even
if it is de-humanization ? In our idealism
we have endeavored to eliminate hypoc-

. Are we destined to fall prey to the
greatest of all rationalizations : the ends
justify the means? What we want to see
established are humane ways of dealing
with humanity, and the only way to do
this is to treat people as people, even if
it seems to be “ineffective.”

The reasons for demonstrating
should be reconsidered. Is the agreement Nv
of many people a sign of correctness? did
Can a demonstrating crowd talk with
people, or do they tend to shout at im-
personal passersby? To what degree is
a demonstration an attempt to violently read u
persuade others by wielding implicit y? Now
power over them ?

pends on what our goals are, since we

To the Editor:

The meeting on Tuesday night,
concerning the Laotian invasion,
disturbed me because it made
clear, through all its chaos, that no
one knew what was going on, or
had been going on previous to the
meeting.

Professor Rinkus seemed to make
a plea for the individual to ed-
ucate himself about the issues and
then make a moral commitment,
but he bored people. There was
strong desire on the part of some
to make some kind of symbolic than twice in real earnest last

of our society. We have an enorm-

Chicago Concert Explained

By ANDREW MEYER

| GUEST COLUMN

———

Since I have been asked the same question by so many people in so

many different tones of voice, I suppose I should attempt to explain why
we do the things we do...

First, why two shows for CHICAGO? As you know, we have never

ows in the past. But what you may not know, is that

d out the 8:30 performance. That is a

dering the fact that in an attempt to

Bucknell students, we hadn’t put

‘ore faced with the follow-

ndreds of complaints

CHICAGO.

For many reasons, we decided upon the latter. The most important
reason should be evident by looking at the concerts at surrounding
schools. Penn State University has cancelled all of its concerts because
of a gate crashing problem. Lehigh University has been forced to cancel
its concerts for the rest of the year. Muhlenburg College has a serious
morale problem because of the high price of tickets for its concerts. At

oncert organizations left in
the country. The Concert d approximately one
concert a month (excluding January and exam months) this year and is
in an excellent condition to continue to do so.

Our feeling was, therefore, that the best way to preserve our concert
system would be to allow as many people as possible inside the gym,
instead of having to contend with them outside the gym. Ergo, two
shows. We felt that dissatisfaction would be least if all of the Bucknell
community was able to see a concert with CHICAGO, instead of creating
a tense and uncomfortable situation the night of the concert.

The second question is, why can’t Season Ticket holders simply go
to any show they want to without having to pay any more money? This
question is a bit more difficult to explain.

When we first organized the Season Ticket system three years ago
we never had any idea that we would ever be presenting two shows in
Davis Gym. In iact, until Feb. 2 we did not have any idea we would bee
presenting two shows in Davis Gym. Let me first emphasize that the
‘success of the concert series at Bucknell is entirely due to the volume-
buying, volume-selling (similar to a large discount store which buys more
for less, and can sell for less) Season Ticket System which we have been
using for our concert series. The addition of a second show, however,
made a weakness of this system quite obvious to everyone concerned.

Legal Matters

Once we have sold a season ticket at a discount price for a certain
show, we are forced to have everyone who has the same ticket go to the
same show. This is because we have made certain financial committ-
ments with CHICAGO that obligate us legally to a certain ticket structure
for a certain show. The only way we can alter that structure is by ac-
cepting refu for a ticket at one price, and then, in effect, selling a
new ticket ($5.50, the late show) at the other previously agreed upon
price. So, we find ourselves in a position where we are legally unable
to simply reshuffle the season ticket to any show we would like. All
Season Ticket holders have to g0 to one show, or turn in their Season
Ticket so we will have a record of their refund, and then purchase an-
other regular ticket like any other customer might.

Another less complicated reason it that we must know how many
people are going to each show. What would happen if on the night of the
concert 7000 ticket holders decided to go to the late show and 500 de-
cided to go to the early show. We would be in a position where 7000
people legitimately have tickets to see CHICAGO but we would have ‘c
turn most of them away

Beyond all of this confusion, I have two apologies to make. The first
is that it seems we have made an error which quite honestly, never
occurred to us in early February when we tried to pull this whole
operation into action within a few short days. We really had no idea that
the late show would be preferred to the early w. However, I have been
assured by CHICAGO that they will do two full shows (as long as, or
longer than the one show by Blood, Sweat and Tears, Sly and others)
and they are aware of the importance of doing a long first show.

I have also become aware of one particular situation which I con-
sider to be unfair to some Bucknell students, and which I am going to
personally try to rectify. There are some students who bought the
original Season Ticket with the knowledge that they had to work until
a certain hour but would be through in time to go to the 8:30 performance.
These students are now forced to pay more to go to the second show
since they have to work until after the 7:30 performance begins. So, any
student who has been inconvenienced by the earlier performance time
because of legitimate job obligation which restricts them from going to
the 7:30 show, ‘while they would have been able to make the originally
scheduled 8:30 show), should write me at B-561 and I will enclose late
show tickets. We will absorb the difference in price. Please enclose your
season tickets and your box number in the letter, and enclose a brief
explanation of the conflict.

I hope this helps to clarify matters. Please try to remember that
the Concert Committee is a student organization working for you, and
every decision we make has this premise firmly in mind. I thin)
CHICAGO'S performance on Friday night will answer all remain:
questions.

Zeller went on to say, “PAYE
proposals present an interesting
possibility for assisting the student
and family to manage their budget
but they speak only to the first part
of the problem. We are closer than
we realize to the point at which the
public may revolt against continued
increase in cost and PAYE pro-
posals will be most unapropriate
and seen only as a device to wring
additional dollars out of the al-
ready harlpressed budgets without
accompanying justification on 4
hard dollar and cents basis.”

Zeller went on to ask major ques-
tions such as, the relationship of
this program to already existing
scholarship and loan programs, not-
ing that now, the student with the
best chance of making a large in-
come after he graduates is given a
scholarship but under the PAYE
plan this person would be the best
risk for a loan.

The Vice President also question-
ed the source of the money,
whether it be on an institutional
basis donated by independent or-
ganizations such as Ford or The
Sloan Foundation, or through a na-
tional lending agency which could
perhaps do the job more efficiently.

basis it will be of little use to

Hypotheses, which appear to be
offered as possibilities, Keen called

presume the existence of a final
answer.

Speaking of the reordering of
society around the theory of pos-

blame for present violence on the
belief that two different views of
the truth must ultimately be re-
duced to one. He said, “We im-
pinge on others’ possible worlds
only because we forget that they

Matmen Overwhelm Red Raiders

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

The Thundering Herd trampled
the Colgate Red Raiders into the
mat 28-6 over the weekend. The
Bison grapplers were aided in their
»verwhelming victory by the fact
that Colgate’s varsity 126 pounder

and heavyweight did not wrestle.

Bison matmen were able to sweep
the first three bouts. Tom Wason

Cagers Conquer Lehigh,
Falter Against Leopards

By ALAN GROCHAL

By splitting two games over the
weekend, the Bisons have moved
up to third place in the MAC
Western Section.

A win over Lehigh, 60-50 last Fri-
day, pulled the Thundering Herd
ahead of Delaware in the stand-
ings. Despite a loss to Lafayette,
Saturday, the Bisons are 44 in the
league and are now tied with Dela-
ware, who is 3-3.

The Blue Hens were one of the
most highly rated MAC teams in
preseason polls, but the team has
been hampered by injuries. For
many of their recent games, Dela-
ware has been down to six players.

The victory over Lehigh was one
of the Bisons’ most impressive
performances of the year. Showing
a new fastbreaking offense, the
Herd was able to score many easy
baskets.

Harvey Carter played another
fantastic game. He garnered eight-
een rebounds, scored twenty-three
points, and blocked several shots.
Carter hit on 75% of his shots
from the field.

Coach Don Smith gave fans a
preview of next year’s team when
he played five sophomores through-
out a large part of the second half.

Chris Riley, the only senior
starter, first got into foul trouble
and later injured his knee, to press
sophomore Jack Darnall into ac-
tion, Darnall responded with a
solid performance. Riley still man-
aged eleven points despite his
limited action.

Outside shooting apparently spel-
led the difference in the game.
BU was outrebounded and outshot
from thet foul line by the Engi-
neers, but hit 50% of their shots to
Lehigh’s 37%.

The win was certainly sweet re-
venge for the triple overtime loss
which Lehigh inflicted on the Bi-
sons earlier in the season.

Against Lafayette the Herd was-
n’t quite as fortunate. Tracy Tri-
pucka, one of the leading scorers
in the nation, scored twenty-seven
points to lead the Leopards to a
73-57 victory.

For BU, Jim Donovan and Paul
Biko scored twelve points each, but
Harvey Carter, in foul trouble, was
held to five.

Chenoweth Discusses Relationship with Boyd Douglas

Editor’s Note: (Boyd Douglas
is an alleged government in-
former in the Harrisburg 6
case in which Jesuit Priest
Philip Berrigan and five others
were indicted for conspiring to
kidnap Presidential adviser
Henry Kissinger and to blow
up heating systems in the
White House. Douglas’s where-
abouts are currently unknown.)
“I’m sure he wasn’t always

honest with me, but I didn’t know
any other way to relate to him
except as a university professor
who could help him and as a
friend,”’ said Gene Chenoweth, pro-
fessor of political science, in an
interview about his relations with
Boyd Douglas, the probable princi-
ple prosecution witness in the Har-
risburg 6 case.
Douglas was a

convict in the

Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary
but took day classes here in 1970
as part of a study-release program
organized between the prison and
the university. Chenoweth came to
know Douglas as part of this pro-
gram.

Chenoweth first met Douglas in
about February 1970, near the be-
ginning of last year’s second se-
mester. ‘‘He came to me looking
for a department to go to. His in-
terest seemed to be in penology,”
said Chenoweth. “He eventually
wound up here,” he continued,
stating that Douglas “‘looked as
though he would pursue political
science” had he stayed on as a
day student.

Chenoweth acted ‘‘sort of as an
adviser’? to Douglas. “I kept some
kind of contact with the prison on
his program. I wrote in his behalf

Professor Richard Drinnon discussed the Berrigan Brothers and the
Radical Catholic Left at Tuesday’s Contact lecture discussion.

Drinnon Discusses Berrigans,
Radical Underground Catholics

By BILL WHITNEY

Dan and Phil Berrigan and the
other Radical Catholics have be-
come “the cutting edge of the
Peace Movement.”

“They stand for a moral revolu-
tion which, I think, is desperately
needed.”’

This was the general theme of

the Contact lecture-discussion ‘The
Catholic Left: The Berrigans and
Others’’, presented by Dr. Richard
Drinnon, professor of history,
last Tuesday at 12:30 in New Dorm
Pit.
In his lecture, Dr. Drinnon ob-
served that by the summer of 1970
the Peace Movement was slowing
down, that “dispair had set in,” In
spite of letters, demonstrations,
even a march on the Pentagon it-
self, “‘the slaughter went on.”

However, when Daniel Berrigan,
a Roman Catholic priest, became a
fugitive for his anti-war actions
(destroying Draft Board files) and
eluded authorities for several
months, Drinnon personally experi-
enced ‘‘great glee’ and “great ad-

By TOM NOVINGER

Two faculty members will be
absent from the University by the
beginning of the 1971-72 academic
year, according to an announce-
ment by Wendell I. Smith, Uni-
versity provost. Leaving the Uni-
versity are Dr. Mills F. Edgerton,
professor of Spanish, and Dr.
Michael A. Santulli, assistant pro-
fessor of philosophy.

A leave of absence has been
granted to Dr. Edgerton for a full
year. He will spend this summer at

miration for what he had done.”

Through their actions, the Berri-
gans “brought drive to the Move-
ment” and made people believe
that “this is a living thing.”

Because of their great impact,
Dr. Drinnon then posed the ques-
tion of where these underground
priests came from.

The Radical Catholics ‘come
from ‘Hardhat’ country,’ which
shows that the Peace Movement
“isn’t so Waspish as it seemed.”
The “‘Super-Americanism” of Hard-
hats turned into ‘‘super-radicalism”’
when the Catholic left felt they saw

when asking for his probation,” he
explained.

“His coming to me initially had
more to do with the discussion of
penology, but I wanted to know
about him and prison life,’ said
Chenoweth. “He also wanted to
discuss with me political questions
related to the war in Vietnam and
the trial in Chicago (last year’s
Chicago 7 trial).”

Chenoweth continued, “He talk-
ed movement stuff with me. I
don’t think he had a very deep
understanding of the war in Viet-
nam. He had a kind of romance
with Catholic activism.

“T felt that there were potentially
better students than Boyd Douglas
in the prison, but he had the
money to come out.’’ Chenoweth
did say that Douglas seemed “‘very
conscientious’ about keeping his

record straight early.

Chenoweth stressed that Douglas
had applied for summer grant
noney last year (‘‘a small a-
mount”) which would lead to a
survey of the University’s re-
sources on penology for a January
plan this past January. “This was
to include visiting prisons with
students,” said Chenoweth.
Douglas had backing on the pro-
ject, but since the Berrigan case
broke, Douglas has not been heard
from and consequently, the project
fell through. Chenoweth said that
he had last spoken with Douglas in
“very early December.”
Douglas’s political involvement
seemed to begin when he met
Philip Berrigan, whom Chenoweth
said Douglas was very impressed
by, in prison last year. Allegedly,
Douglas eventually began to carry

letters for the peace movement in
and out of prison while he was @
day student.

At one point, Chenoweth specifi-
cally asked Douglas if he was
transporting messages. “I told him
he would’ve jeopardized the study-
release program and himself, but
he said, ‘No, I did not.’ It now ap-
pears that he lied to me,’’ Cheno-
weth related. “I know he was talk-
ing to people on the telephone.”

Asked if he felt that Douglas
was a government informer, Chen-
oweth said, ‘It would appear that
he worked with the government
but not as a plan.”

Chenoweth also said that he had
his own “hypothesis” on Douglas's
role in the case. “‘All it can be is
a_ hypothesis, Chenoweth ex-
plained, “but (he) wanted to avoid

Expresses Concern About Usage

Risch States Drug Policy

By ERIC RIESS

Thomas J. Risch, Dean of Men,
indicated that University under-
cover agents investigating the use
of drugs on campus or for any
other purpose, do not exist

Risch stated the University would
not employ or in any way sponsor
undercover agents on campus.

Risch said however that no one
could rule out the possibilities of
action by local authorities at any
time. He commented, “We have no
way of knowing what the local
authorities might do in this area.
They are under no obligaion to in-
form us of their intentions and pro-
bably would not.

The Dean noted that it was pos-
sible that state and local officials
are interested in our campus as an
area of drug usage and supply.

Risch went on to say, “Of course
we are concerned with the fre-
quence of drugs on campus and do
realize they exist. We are concerned
that students know what the situa-
tion is and that they realize the pos-
sible consequences of their actions.
We also want students to realize
that the University can not be
a haven for illegal activities.”

At the beginning of this academic
year in September the University
released guidelines for the campus
which stated, ‘“‘a person who vio-
lates a state or federal law on Uni-
versity property, when such a vio-
lation has a detrimental effect on
the University and/or it’s members,

will subject that person to Uni-
versity action. An individual is di-
rectly responsible for obeying state
and federal laws.”

Risch went on to say, ‘‘We have
discussed present conditions with
members of our staff and will meet
with resident assistants and other
students to explain more fully the
University’s position.

Risch concluded, ““We want stu-

dents to be ¢ re of all
effects drug
them we

the possible
may have for
s their influence on
of the campus.”
with the Univers-
ity’s drive 1ake students aware
of what th possibilities might be,
Risch has offered to lead a Contact
discussion next Tuesday on “Drugs
and the Univer Campus’ at

Symposium Features
Distinguished Blacks

By LINDA DIETRICK

An Afro-American symposium
will take place next weekend, spon-
sored by the sub-committee on
black studies. As part of a con-
tinuing project which is seeking to
increase the University’s consci-
ousness of the black experience,
the symposium will bring three
prominent black intellectuals to the
campus for lectures and discussion.

Veda Butcher, an Afro-American
musicologist who heads the African
Music Institute at Howard Uni-
versity, will speak about African
Music, Sunday at 2:30 p.m. in
Vaughan Literature Auditorium.

Saunders Redding, a_ literary
critic who specializes in Afro-

Satire on Television and Culture

‘Groove Tube’ Reflects American Life

By DEAN LANDEW

As I was about to enter Coleman
Hall to see the 11 o’clock showing
of “Groove Tube” Wednesday, I
heard someone who was just leav-
ing say, ‘Don’t waste your money!
It’s terrible!”

After seeing “Groove Tube,” I
am trying to decide whether he
meant the actual production was
terrible or that the reflection of
what he saw was terrible.

“Groove Tube” is a cogent state-
ment reflecting life in America’ on
two levels. Superficially, it is a
satire on television; and as a satire,
it reflects the real influence of
television and consequently, it re-
flects our culture. The satire itself
is funny enough; but what really
can be seen is profound.

As comedy, it is easy to laugh at
Robert Elgin, the automated news
commentator, when the camera
fails to pan out at the end of the
broadeast: it is vicarious everyday
failure.

It is just as easy to laugh at love-
making when it is treated as if it
were an Olympic contest. So how
come these things make you laugh
more when you rehash them after-
wards with your friends then when
you actually saw them?

Because it is more than satire.
To make one basic statement about
what “Groove Tube” is saying:
sexual acceptance and attainment
is foremost in the minds of many
Americans today. Sex, of course,
has been impressed upon everyone
in some way as being the supreme
social accomplishment, and much
of this impression comes from tele-
vision, (Koko the clown wasn’t too
far off the mark.)

As a corollary to this rule, “Gro-
ove Tube” makes it apparent that
Americans generally seem to have
sexually symbolic fetish for PUTT-
ING THINGS INTO OTHER
THINGS for pleasure, security or
status. Olive pits into pitted cher-
ries into pitted olives; marijuana

into heads; bodies into prestigious
cars; Brown 25 between bathroom
tiles; penises into vaginas.

For various reasons America
seems obsessively motivated to fill
up the cracks.

It all makes sense. If the Love
Games from Tijuana sequence
brought as tense and anxious an
atmosphere to the show you went
to as the one I saw, you'll under-
stand. It was very funny when the
satellite broke down and the audi-
ence was asked to “please stand
by.” But you really wanted to see
what was so outrageously described.

The list goes on and on, but it
is worth it to mention the final
flaunting. That jocular penis nodd-
ing, telling you what to watch out
for in venereal disease. “A bird in
the hand is better than one in the
bush,” In reality, not really.

Of only slightly less significance
is America’s acceptance of vio-
lence, physical and mental, in-

Scope of Education

“Intellectual freedom is essential to human so-
ciety.” Not merely a political statement by a renowned
Russian dissident, these words written by Andrei Sak-
arov, a Soviet physicist are of universal application.

Within the framework of intellectual freedom
comes the airing of opinions of all sides, including the
radical left and right. Indeed, the views of the radical
left and right are often dismissed in favor of the es-
tablishment views which arise and too frequently stag-
nate in liberal/conservative debate. This situation ob-
viously has occurred here many times.

With the aim of widening the intellectual scope of
our community, a discussion series, entitled “Radical
Views of Society” begins next Friday at 10 p.m, in the
University Lounge. Nine more weekly discussions will
follow on topics such as education, economics, violence
and women’s liberation.

The organizers of this series will present the views
of the radical left. We applaud their effort to further
intellectual freedom here, and we hope that other groups
of individuals might organize similar series on other,
nontraditional attitudes toward society.

Of course, such a program will only be as success-
ful as the response of its audience. We urge support of
these efforts to expand the flow of ideas in the Uni-
versity.

FEEDBACK

PIII LI IL.

By JOHN TILTON

January Plan

report on the 1971 January Program will help me ex-
y with approval the suggestion made by Charles Muss-
n the Guest Column of February 12.

A prelimin

why I gr

cial registration for 1971 shows a considerable increase over that
of 1970, an increase sufficient to support the belief that an already strong
voluntary Jan Plan is generatnig further strength out of its own momen-
tum. About thirty-five more projects were carried out and about twenty
more faculty members acted as sponsors in 1971 than in 1970. And most
significantly, the percentage of the entire student body that was regis-
tered rose from 1970’s 23.6 percent to 30.2 precent, a 6.6 percent increase.
The number of students registered rose from 672 to 886. But as gratify-
ing as these statis’ may be, they do not truly reflect actual participa-
tion because these statistics do not embrace those students who, as Mr.
Mussman points out, may have ‘‘spent their time profitably” in activities
not offically registered

Using the 1970 statistics as an example, let’s see what happens if we
momentarily adopt Mr. Mussman’s premise that in some way these
profitable but unr tered activities ought to be recorded. If we were to
add to the 1970 registration figure the 228 “unofficial projects” and ‘‘ex-
periences of significant educational value’ that I culled from the 1970
questionnaire, we get a total of 900 students who took good educational
advantage of the 1970 Jan Plan. No count has yet been made of ‘“‘unof-
ficial projects’ for 1971, yet if we assume a similar proportion of register-

gistered projects in 1971, the true measure of participation in
well be 41 percent rather than 30.2 percent.

But enough of statistics. The problem that Mussman has pinpointed
the need to end speculation about how many students have executed

FACULTY FORUM

Politics for the University?

Professors Longley and Rinkus have asked the
faculty to reaffirm its belief in academic freedom by
disallowing any informer of the U.S. Government on
campus. On the face of it, the motion is based on two
unassailable grounds. Academic freedom is something
by which we live and none of us will ever speak against
it. From the time we were first graders, we were
taught by our teacher, let’s call her Miss Emma, that
one should not be a “‘tattle-tale.’’ And since all of us
adored Miss Emma, and she was by definition always
right, we have developed the habit of hating informers.
Thus to vote against the current motion seems to the
casual observer that one does not care about academic

freedom, and is out right disrespectful of the cherished
memory of Miss Emma.

However, on closer examination, it becomes ob-
vious that the current motion is neither well-conceived,
nor beneficial to academic freedom.

The alleged conspiracy case has not been proven,
nor the fact of the presence of an informer. As the two
sponsors of the motion remarked: “It should be readily
conceded that as yet there is no ‘formal’ evidence that
there was indeed an informer on our campus.” Yet
the prospect of having an an informer was so odious
to them that they found it necessary to take a pre-
ventive measure to ‘‘condemn without reservation the
use of any member of the University community as
an undercover agent for any branch of the United
States Government.” We are asked to vote on a
problem which may not actually exist, and without
the benefit of full and impartial inquiry.

Assuming that there indeed was an informer, the
motion cannot attain a goal which it is intended.
Undercover agents, by nature, cannot be easily de-
tected, and the University has no enforcement power
on these matters. The only way it could prevent the
presence of such undercover agents would be to
eliminate the conditions which necessitated the pres-
ence of such agents in the first place. In fact our
attention should be directed to this area. If we insist
on making pronouncements on matters over which we
have no control, we are no different from those meta-

ians who were castigated by Bertrand Russell,

“like savages are apt to imagine a magical con-
nection between words and things.”

The only matter over which Bucknell has control
is the study-release program for the Lewisburg peni-
tentiary. For humanitarian and social reasons, I would
like to see its continuation. Yet if the present motion
goes into effect, the only possible victims might be
those inmates who could otherwise benefit from this
program. The explanatory note to the motion states
that the intent of such a program might have been
subverted, and one could draw a conclusion that to
avoid the recurrence of the possibility of having an-
other informer, students coming from the penitentiary
should be further scrutinized. This could lead to the
denial of admission to otherwise qualified students.
And once admitted, those poor souls might be subjected
to probing and hostile eyes from those of us who are
presumed to adhere to the principle of a “free and
open university.”

By DAVID LU

The explanatory note avers that the four Bucknell-
jans were “subjected to the inconvenience an anxiety
accompanying a grand jury subpoena.” Conspicuously
absent from the note is an assertion that their aca-
demic freedom had been impinged upon. Yet by a
curious application of ill defined syllogism the note
comes to the illogical conclusion. A. Four Bucknellians
were subpoenaed and inconvenienced. B. There might
have been an informer who was the cause of all the
trouble. C, Therefore the U.S. Government should not

be permitted to have any informer on the Bucknell
campus.

Illogical aside, what is disturbing in this note is
the presumption that academic freedom can extend its
protection over civil and criminal matters. A Socrates
calmly taking the hemlock casts a far nobler figure
than a Berrigan burning draft files of others. We should
be respectful enough of the law to be willing to sub-
mit to a subpoena no matter how inconvenient it might
be. Instead of prejudging the proceedings which have
barely begun, we must give our judiciary a chance to
show us that it works, and works rather well. We
should not liken the pending Harrisburg trials to
Chicago. Yale was in ugly turmoil because someone
claimed that Black Panthers could not be tried fairly,
yet the trials that followed suprised most of those
demonstrators by their fairness. Why must we prejudge
by approving this motion? That in itself is non-aca-
demic and closed-minded.

If we pursue the logic of the explanatory note
further, we must arrive at the conclusion that members
of an academic community could engage in activities
which might be injurious to the state but should not
be inconvenienced by it. It does not take note of the
distinction between the professor as a private citizen
and as a member of the academic community. It
simply insists on an all-comprehensive immunity for
those who belong to the academy. This, in effect, is
to make the academic community a state within a
state, enjoying privileges analogous to diplomatic im-
munity and extra-territoriality. In the case of diplo-
matic immunity—which incidentally does not extend
to consular officials—the state granting it has certain
remedies, e.g., by declaring the offending diplomat a
persona non grata. The power asserted by the ex-
planatory note is far more extensive and unattainable.

In the past one of the strengths of the American
academic community has been the ease with which its
own personnel could work with the government and the
business community or vice versa, and there has been
constant interchange of ideas between these institut-
ions. In this country there has been less divorce be-
tween theory and practice to the benefit of all insti-
tutions concerned. The motion would not hesitate hav-
ing the academy become divorced from the reality of
life. It would prefer its own splendid isolation to thé’
“contamination” by the ills of the government or of
the world. Thus, the motion before us, brought by
those who are presently more actively concerned with
politics, would on its passage have the curious effect
of insulating the academy from the world. That could
presage a return to the ivory tower that is the anomaly
of this motion.

Loading the Guns

By RICK VANCE

Man, lemme tell ya somethin’. Them three cats is messed up. I mean,
the other day I’m sittin’ in this food joint in D.C. and who should walk in
but the big Three: hardhat hero Spiro, Hoove the Groove, and King
Pecker himself. Well, the next thing I know they flash me toothpaste
smiles and sit two booths away. Now I’m really uptight. I mean, I’m one
of them-there freaky pinkos, so why the hell do they make with the
grins all of a sudden? Anyway, pretty soon they start shootin’ the breeze,
so I listen, man, because I’m cool.

First off, the Greek orders lasagne and Hoove tells him no. He says
the Wops shouldn’t patronize till they go legit. Then Prez orders every-
body to get hotdogs and apple pie for dindin. Ok, so I’m thinkin’ these
cats are really weird, man. Like, they gotta be messed up to order crap
like that in a Frenchy coffeehouse. Pretty soon Hoove coughs up some
phlegm and starts talkin’ in a low whisper.

*“Yoy wouldn’t believe what those angels are planning now.” he says.

I’m thinking, ‘What angels?”

“Those student activists are peachy,’ he continues. “They parade
around courthouses, lay in front of buses. . .”

“I think public displays of affection are disgusting,” The Greek
interrupts.

“Shut up, ya jerk,” big Dick says. “He’s not talking about sex.”

“Oh,” Agnew says. Then Hoove the groove continues.

“The other day we bugged this room at B.U., and you wouldn’t be-
lieve what those little darlings were planning. The one guy suggests with
a straight face that all students should boycott the ‘74’ Presidential elec-
tions. That way, this guy says, when Nixon wins a shallow landslide
victory, his psyche will be destroyed. Because he realizes the kids didn’t
vote.”

Now, I go to B.U., and that idea happened to be a good one. I mean,
I pledged all my support, so I’m wondering why Dick and company are
laughing so hard and flashin’ me smiles all the time. They even offered
to pay my bill, and buy me some extra live beads. I mean, ain’t that
the cat’s pajamas. I’m their arch enemy, bent on destroying the piss out
of ’em, and they’re flashing me smiles. I'tellya, they hafta be masoch-
istic or nuts or somethin’. I mean, sometimes I just can’t figure them
cats out.

Used Books
To the Editor:

As a freshman, I have just gone
through the first biannual hassle
of trying to sell some of last se-
mester’s books and at the same
time buy this semester’s books at
half price from other students. It
seems to me that much time and
effort could be saved if the Uni-
versity Bookstore made facilities
easily available for the buying and
selling of used books. In the long
run, the savings to students in book
costs (which are high) would be
considerable.

Many colleges and universities
presently do operate such facilities.
When the Bookstore is moved into
University Center next fall, there

should be plenty of room for the
store to provide a used book
service.

The Bookstore could buy used
books, according to their condition,
at a price slightly below half price.
They then could be sold at a price
slightly above the buying price —
the difference going towards sal-
aries of employees. In the long run,
students would benefit because 1)
they would be more likely to sell.
all the books they desired to and 2/
at the beginning of the semester
students would be better able to
see what used books are available.

Besides, it would be a heck of a
lot easier to find a ride home when
the bulletin boards aren’t cluttered
with book ads.

Need More Help

Volunteer Services Staffs Agencies

By JON DeBENEDICTIS

Three hundred Bucknell students
assisted the C.A.’s Volunteer Ser-
vices program last semester. They
need about three thousand. New
programs are being initiated and
the old ones still need more help.
What can you do?

Volunteers are attempting to es-
tablish a child guidance center in

«Sunbury but many more are need-

ed to plan the task and staff the
center once in operation. The time
given would be up to the volunteer.

Students are needed at a new
center in Milton to work on a one-
to-one basis with handicapped,
mentally retarded, and emotionally
disturbed children of pre-school age.
Volunteers are needed from 1:00
p.m. - 3:30 p.m. one day a week.
Up to eight are needed every day.

Headstart needs additional volun-
teers this semester to work ap-
proximately 2-3 hours once a week
(time to be decided by teacher and
Bucknell student).

The juvenile probation officer in
Sunbury, who is staffing his ser-
vices alone, needs students to as-
sist in afternoon group rap sessions,
and others to work on a one-to-one
basis with those trying to find jobs,
etc. The facilities are available,

«; but volunteers are needed to staff

them.

The Youth Services Bureau in
Sunbury needs volunteers to help
them establish and staff a “hot
line.”

The Evangelical Home for the
Aged would like additional students
to befriend its residents whose
families are not here to help them.

The Selinsgrove and Laurelton
State Schools need more volunteers
to assist patients with occupational
therapy, speech therapy, recrea-
tional planning and friendship ser-
vice. This would require only an
hour a week and as many volun-
teers as patients are needed.

Possibly having greatest priority
is a specific program for the pat-
terning of a mentally retarded child.
This child has not been making pro-
gress because of lack of assistance.
The child needs 4 persons a day, 7
days a week. This would mean 28
people would be needed to train
the child twice a day for an hour.
Such a project might be taken on
by a hall group. fraternity, or
sorority.

Similar actions were taken by
two sororities last semester when
they worked together for three
weeks with orally handicapped. A
speech therapist set up guidelines,
and the twenty volunteers worked
an hour per week. The patients
showed remarkable progress, and
some were even able to leave the

class:

The C.A. would like to integrate
the community into their services
and some members of the com-
munity have already volunteered
their services for transportation.

As those that have joined have
discovered, it’s the initial decision
to sacrifice some time for some-
one else that is hard to make, But
once they have volunteered, near-
ly 100% of the students remain in
the program.

What’s in it for me???

This is the question every person
confronts himself with when he
reads a plea for volunteer services.
No monetary or other material
gratification is given for the few
short hours required of a volunteer.

The only satisfaction from these
endeavors might be the smile of a
child who just pronounced the word,
“horse,” correctly for the first
time, seeing new hope in the eyes
of an aged citizen, seeing a puzzle
completed by a mentally retarded
child without your help, or finding
out that a former juvenile delin-
quent you'd been working with
found a steady job for himself

There will be results, and those
you work with will progress, but
they need your help. If you can
find some time for someone else,
call 3486 or drop by Room 6 on the
ground floor of the Botany building
Someone needs you!

plan but find themselves “spending tt ir time profitably,” or who con~-
scientiously set about design and executing a project once they get
home, would have am time to fulfill the simple requirements needed
to qualify them for official istration and transcript credit. The Di-
rector could easily provide each student with a list of faculty members
available to sponsor a project at the last minute, and the student could
phone or write to a sponsor to gain approval and thus official registra-
tion of his belatedly conceived project

This recommendation alters Mr. Mussman’s suggestion somewhat so
as to bring it within the spirit and almost within the letter of the Jan-
uary Program pol! The adoption of this recommended change in
registration procedw requires Faculty approval of a change in a
regulation that has already in effect been changed the regulation that
“Registration will take place in October or November” has been bent
considerably because of faculty pressure to get late projects registered.
And herein lies a vital distinction between Mr. Mussman’s suggestion
and my recommendation.

If by his phrase “‘after the fact’? Mr. Mussman means that a stu-
dent should have the privilege of approaching a potential sponsor in
February—for the first time—to gain approval of a project already
completed, I must demur. Aside from the problems the faculty would
face in attempting to deal with previously unknown projects, I am con-
cerned about the student’s depriving himself of the value of registration.
“Registration” is, after all, only university jargon for “commitment,”
and the value I refer to derives from committing oneself to a consciously
conceived and seriously intended endeavor. Alertness, concentration,
methodical application, even provision of adequate time are made possible
by early committment. Since we have but four brief weeks in the Jan
Plan, should a student who does not realize his commitment by the end
of two weeks be given credit for having utilized the Jan Plan in a signifi-
cant way? I have my doubts. Surely commitment can come late; it can
even be the product of a grad y evolving interest. But at the moment
it seems to me unwise t to invite what may well be dilatori-
ness and i after the fact’? registration. What do

another time in (the prison), the
FBI and the prison caught him
with contraband (the letters) be-
fore the errigans were arrested
and sort of gave him the choice—
cooperate with information or pay
the price.

“As I understand it, Boyd is an
alleged informer,” continued Chen-
oweth. “I find it conceivable that
Boyd may have been lied to by the
government (about the case), al-
though it doesn’t seem to make
much sense like that.’

Chenoweth feels that the govern-
ment has “‘violated the University
program.’ He also said, “I think
they manipulated him.”

Chenoweth then mentioned the
motion he brought up at a recent
faculty meeting. The motion would
reject the manipulation of the Uni-
versity staff or students by govern-
ment agents. This motion was pas-
sed

He added that the political
science honorary here wrot J. Ed-
é Hoover to ask him to come
here to speak, but that Hoover
turned the invitation down on the
basis of havi too many commit-
ments already

Chenoweth currently teaches at
the penitentiary once a week, but

has not discussed the case with
any of the inmates. “I felt that
woud be unwise at this time,”
he said. “The prisoners don’t talk
about it, although they might like
to.

As for the study-release program,
Chenoweth feels ‘“‘it has been cal-
led into question, but it shouldn’t
be jeopardized. The men behind
the walls would suffer and so
would the campus.” He also said
that ‘“‘the warden and the college
will be more circumspect in the
future.”

Regarding the actual Harrisburg
6 case, Chenoweth stated, ‘I
don’t think they’ve (the govern-
ment) got a case. I believe the
Berrigan (denial of guilt) state-
ment.” He feels that the defend-
ants are “innocent until proven
guilty and the burden of proof is
on the government.”

“I could conceive that there
will be no trial,” Chenoweth re-
marked. If it believed it had lost
its case, Chenoweth said, the gov-
ernment should claim that a public
trial could impair our national se-
curity by releasing certain in-
formation

“We can wait for the trial
Chenoweth said. “This is all
speculation.’

about American involvement in
Latin America, Dan and Phil Ber-

Dan Berrigan, before his involve-

THE GNU AND THE GURU GO BEHIND THE BEYOND
(A CAUTIONARY TALE)
By Peggy Clifford.

Stephen Dedalus once said that if you think about something you understand it; and
undoubtedly in our times there are many people and things which need to be understood. So
borne by Stevie’s premise I ventured into the Behind-the-Beyond and observed a quiet
Midwestern town where the minds of our younger brothers and sisters are being shaped

and twisted (as ours were a decade or so ago).

I have heard that we are what we have once eaten, yet how often do we go back and
reconstruce those old menus. Last Spring I attempted just that and began by reading a
handful of those fantasies woven by Anderson. What I found was abhoring: the gross and
indiscriminate butcherings in the likes of Big Claus and Little Claus and the associated

beautiful are not surrogates for the good.

ese readings I also noted his arbtirary assign-

ly evil, conversely the

the two great camps of Good and Evil certainly needs to be reconsidered
son catalyzed my recent venture and observations

David and the Phoenix is the story of a young boy’s friendship with that strange and
mythical bird which can be found in the folklore of so many Peoples. Together they travel
the world in order to supplement David's traditionally stunted education. In this they are
aided by griffins, banshees and a host of other imaginary beings. Throughout the tale they
successfully evade a sinster scientist who attempts to slay or capture the bird—for the good
of science only. In the end the phoenix rises from his pyre, as tradition calls for every five
hundred years. He, the Phoenix, escapes and David though sad at his loss is a much wiser

young man.

So there you are. An innoucuous child’s

tale? Not quite, for masquerading under the

guise of innocence is a tacitly expressed ideology which is swallowed whole by the unknow-
ing child. For example, in David the author manipulates the traditional Good-Evil dualism
and pits our lovable old bird against that sinster man-of-knowledge. At a time in history
when insanity runs rampant it seems at best unwise to summon the forces of righteous
wrath against a symbol which should represent clear and distinct thought. To burn this
brand of anti-intellectualism into the mind of the naive child seems but another extension

of the theory that the world is mad.

And then there’s the question of David’s test tube surroundings. If a Caucasian child
is never introduced to his Negroid, Mongoloid or Australoid brothers how can he be ex-
pected to think about them and according to Stevie’s premise without thought, understand-

ing is impossible.

The last of this sample of questionables concerns not the story but the manner in which
it’s sold, One would hope that the purpose of a young people’s book service would be to aid
in the education of children, however, with The Children’s Book Club you get more than you

bargain for. On the dust jacket, expertly placed, is a statement concerned not with the

child’s education, but his acculturation. It simply urges him to join the proud consumerist

tradition of his parents by gently nudging

him into proselytizing the wonders of David and

the club, and to spread the truth among his teachers and friends.

I became aware of The Gnu and the Guru Go Behind the Beyond by means of the
annual pre-Christmas offensive launched by the publications industry.

The story line is too absurd to be worth explication, so let us suffice to say that
the unlikely combination of a gnu and a guru meet the inhabitants of an evolutionary
blind alley, the ugga-wuggas. The latter rule the Behind-the-Beyond, a totally functional
istate where: sidewalks are rolled up after dark to keep them clean; furniture exists
only in the form of frescoes to inhibit the accumulation of dust; and the flag has a
regimented geometrical design (and is raised upon a square flag pole) to attest to the

ideals of the state. Our heroes are capture

is better to be left unsung.

d and escape and what happens in between

The weakness found in Behind the Beyond so outweigh any educational benefits that
one is forced to conclude that it’s merely another in the series of modern techniques which
are devised to smother independent young minds.

The main conceptual idea woven into the tale is that of the evils of centralization. Given:
individualism is a Good Thing, however, if we are ever to attain this elusive ideal then we
must rid ourselves of those preconceived notions which pervade one-dimensional thought.
The centralization of power, coupled with the phenomenal advances in science and tech-
nology ought to be able to free whatever remains of the individual provided his existence
becomes grounded in rationality; which brings us to our second cusp of controversy.
Rationality cannot be mastered by programming our young with cliches. These thought
abridgements are levelling influences which tend to fell any original idea which dares to
burst forth. Any automaton well versed in their usage can get through a day, a year, or a
lifetime simply by conjuring up the correct truism whenever his security seems threatened.
It’s a simple recall situation which unfortunately results in the many who are simple. How-
ever, if you’re not well versed in the art of the cliche Behind-the-Beyond will provide some

fascination reading.

Nevertheless, an educational system cannot be constructed upon inanities, and until
education becomes an ex ducere (which will solely occur through a revolution to thought)
the fable’s conclusion is all but inevitable: only by falling into our violent heritage were the

Gnu and Guru able to escape.

It is questionable whether musical criti-
cism has validity of any kind. After all, it
is merely an attempt at interpolating what
one has heard into a liner, verbal form;
transposition from ear to eye.

Musical criticism doesn’t actually tell
one anything at all about music. It is
merely giving one set of words which may
have some kind of parallel correspondence
to the music, but never does the written
word ever come close to expressing/ex-
plaining/interpreting the music itself.

Verbal metaphors, used in the cause of
music criticism, seem to me to be 50
frustratingly inexact. How I can tell you
about husic by the use of the verbal/print
medium which can never actually reach
the heart of the matter. “If I could turn
you on, if I could drive you out of your
wretched mind, if I could tell you I would
let you know.” (R. D. Laing), I would.

Roberta Flack-First Take
(Atlantic SD 8230)

This is Roberta Flack’s first albumn.
The instrumentation is Miss Flack on
piano and vocals, John Pizzarelli on guitar,
the impeccable Ron Carter on base, and
Ray Lucas on drums. William Fischer, one
of the composers whose words were pre-
sented at Bucknell during the Black Arts-
Festival Weekend last semester, did the
string and horn agrangements on the
album

The album is characterized by the in-
tense singing of Miss Flack, her very
sparse piano style, and Ron Carter’s very
lyrical bass lines; all this serves to create
a quiet, expressive atmosphere which
makes the album a very intimate listen-
ing experience.

Miss Flack touches upon a number of
related musical styles in this album. There
are folkish tunes by Leonard Cohen and
Ewan MacColl, the rock number ‘“Com-
pared to What’ written by Gene McDaniels,
a ballad, a moving Spanish-flavored song
called ‘“‘Angelitos Negros (Black Angels),
and the gospel tune “I Told Jesus’ ar-

ged by Miss Flack. There are

y fine songs written by Donny Hath-

, and Leroy Hutson

If you like blues and jazz singing, 1
think you’ll like this album very much.
“Tryin’ Times,” a Hathaway/Hutson com-
position, is an especially good flowing
blues, and “I Told Jesus” is a gospel num-
ber that slowly builds up to an exciting
climax.

I much prefer this album over Mill
Flack’s second effort, Chapter Two, which
has mostly interpretations of “standard”
tunes like “Let It Be Me,” Just Like A
Woman,” and “The Impossible Dream.”’(?)
If you’d rather hear songs you know, she
does sing them better than most singers
do, For my taste, though, I’d much rather
listen to original material which doesn’t
yet have the dulling effect which I find a
lot of interpretations of standards have if

Dreams are made of.

This band can really rock and it can
really swing too. The members of the band
are all excellent musicians and this album
sure shows how well they can play to-
gether. The album is tight, clean, and has
a tremendous amount of energy. Everyone
sounds like they put a lot into making it
and ds of fun blowing their
heads off

The horn section has fantastic dynamic
control and plays some of the most origin-
al ensemble figures heard in big band
rock to date. The songs themselves are
not fantastic nor are the vocals exceptional
either, but both are indeed good and solid.
The real melodies of the songs seem to
be the horn lines; I find myself singing
along like crazy to them. (Listen to the
horn part on “New York” particularly:
it'll just knock you on your ass.)

The first time you listen to this album
you probably won’t think it is as good as
I’ve made it out to be. But think with re-
peated listenings you'll find that most of
the music will begin to get to you, if not
overwhelm you. And this is one alblum
I’m pretty sure will last.

Comments on ‘the Dead’, Kerouac, Kesey & Cassady

By JONATHAN BAILEY DRAEGER

i never enjoyed feedback-reminds me of
a confused acid trip. acid is only good if
it removes confusion. The Grateful Dead
were just one orgasmic screech after an-
other. their only purpose, it seemed, was
to heighten one’s trip, in my case they
never came close. Workingman’s Dead
came out last year and the Dead had gone
country. they played like musicians. they
were still into acid, cocaine, etc. but they
didn’t let the dope bring them down
musically. their newest albumn is Ameri-
can Beauty. this albumn is even better,
honest, funky, and musically sound.

the Dead is very closely linked to Ken

Kesey (author of One Flew Over the Cuc-
koo’s Nest and Sometimes a Great Notion).

in the early sixties Kesey and his Merry
Pranksters were the trip masters of the
west coast. Kesey and his group conducted
well attended acid tests in L. A. and Frisco.
These consisted of large halls with no
decoration except for psychadelic lighting
and two large barrels of Kool-Aid labled
strong and weak. (meaning intense quan-
tities of acid and lesser quantities). Kesey
had heard the Dead play in clubs around
Frisco and hired them to play at his Acid
Tests. The Dead started through Kesey.

where did Kesey get his initial inspi-
ration (as explained in Tom Wolfe’s Elec-
tric Kool-Aid Acid Test)? Where did his
Pranksters and his urge to rage across the
country come from? they came from one
member of the Pranksters community,
Neal Cassady (alias Dean Moriarity-hero of

Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, where Kerou-
ac spoke firsthand about their adventures
together). In the 1940's Cassady had un-
chemically speeded-dug (dig-it)-yessed his
way across the continent an incredible (yet
uncounted) number of times. he was the
hero of the “‘beat’’ generation, smoking
tea, balling and speeding his way around
the country in Drive-a-way cars. Cassady
and his cars were one, in synch. It was as
if Cassady’s brain had entered the cars’
engines. he could pass on curves, going
120mph, and just miss oncoming cars by
driving on the lefthand shoulder. he couldn’t
stop moving. the police in Frisco claim
that he stole 46 cars in one day. he could
out-run, out-jump, out-talk, any man he
ever met. (he met quite a few). (he once
talked continually from Frisco to Chicago).

he infected Kesey with the desire to cap
ture each moment by moving as fast as
time itself. he was the official Prankster
driver and could trip faster than anyone
in the group. Cassady died trying to run
the length of an inter-state railroad track,
his body just burnt out. Cassady remains
as close to Kerouac as he remains to the
Dead and Kesey. he is one of the links
that makes the Dead’s music even more
interesting.

“Oh what a long strange trip it’s been.”

Since the outer brick work of the
new University Center was com-
pleted last year, members of the
University community have been
unable to ‘monitor’ the progress
which workmen are making on the
5.5 million dollar project.

In an effort to get the ‘real in-
side story’ John F. Zeller, vice
president of administration and fi-
nance, offered to give this reporter
a tour of the partially completed
structure.

Before beginning Zeller com-

mented that work was progressing ; ‘ : ; nt : z Mgt - 4 mn é

on schedule in most parts, and
ahead of schedule at some points.
He went on to note that the Center
will probably be ready for use by
fall of this year.

The fourth floor of the University

The second floor is designed as general activities and
lounge areas.

To the left of the entrance will be a general listening
area. This area will be divided into a series of smaller
rooms with lounge furniture where students will be able
to listen in groups to one tape recording which they can

request, or a student can individually ask the attendant
to put a tape on a special channel for his own listening
pleasure. Students will also have the opportunity to listen
to records which they bring or check out of the Uni-
versity’s record library.

This is the view from the major second floor lounge.
Students, faculty, and administrators will be able to relax
to piped in music and do whatever they please. The view
is one of the nicest from the building and the atmosphere
of relaxation will be further enhanced by the real stone
wall at the back. (picture 2)

The actual snack bar will be located behind the wail

enter through an opening near the entrance from the main

Behind this will be the central communications area for the campus, the switchboard.

These two views of the area set aside for the bookstore attempt to
show some of the 12,000 square feet of space which the store will utilize.
Students will enter and exit through one large door off the main cor-
ridor. The 10 foot aisles will divide sections which will be arranged ac-
cording to the type of book sold. Paperbacks will be in one section with
hard cover books in another and supplies in another.

Warren Elze, director of the bookstore, will have a private office
with a picture window providing him with a full panorama of the store.

Also on the bottom floor off the main corridor will be three television
sets, two for viewing network programming and one closed circuit to
provide students with an up to date schedule of events every day.

The final portion of the ground floor will be a student activities area
with space set aside for darkroom, a game room with pool tables and
ping pong tables, plus what is termed an ‘arts and crafts room’ with
facilities for just about any interest from sewing to large mural painting.

Up one full flight from the lower level and one half a
flight from the door facing up the hill is the cafeteria.
Designed to accommodate the entire student body, the
cafeteria is larger than any on campus now but will be
divided by a series of supports to try and avoid looking
like a huge open room. Hopefully these supports will give
a feeling of privacy.

There will not be any of the traditional lines which
students now experience as students will enter this room

or scramble area to get food. Students will find main
dishes at one place, deserts at another and drinks at still
another.

Students will be free to go from station to station
picking what they want from the expanded menu, and
then exit and possibly pay ‘by the plate’ for the food which
they took. In this way experts say approximately two to
three times the number of students that are currently
served can then be accommodated.

The offices of the food service (picture 2) staff ac-
cording to Zeller, will be ‘the nicest on campus’ in terms
of their view from the second floor.

billed as a sort of ‘Bucknell Waklorf.’ Faculty members could meet their
wives for lunch or students could impress a date with the line of infra-
red cooking specialties. The restaurant can also be divided into smaller

rooms for more private dinners.

The final feature of the floor is the 254 seat audi-
torium. Located in the middle of the floor, it is equipped
with a giant screen (picture 3) with rear projection fa-
cilities. The auditorium is designed for events like faculty
meetings, ABS meetings, or for use during Colloquy
Convocation weekends. Blackboards are available for

from one to

5 visiting guests. Adjoining this room will be a series of
smaller rooms which can be reserved by any group on campus for meet-
ings over a meal. Students or faculty can move through the scramble

downstairs and then conduct their business in a private room upstairs.

use as well as the full range of visual aids. If the
auditorium is not being used for a specific function, the
screen can be used for television viewing for events like
the super bowl where large numbers of people want to see
the same thing.

Behind the front of the auditorium will be the offices

of the director of the center, James Hammerlee. It will
have a meeting room as well as office space.

Adjoining that will be the ‘play area’ of the center. A
large room with cork walls where students can do what
ever suits their creative fancy.

Notes &

Comment

By DAN MILLER
Although the sports pages of The Bucknellian are full of the exploits
of the elite of BU’s corps of athletes, the second and third stringers rarely
have the pleasure of seeing their names in print.
Nevertheless they work just as hard and sweat just as much as the
regulars do in practice and their contributions to the team are not in-

significant.

What team can operate without some sort of strong bench; a reserve
the coach can call on in tight situations?

That’s what relief pitchers are for.

The other benefit of bench strength is the potential for added scoring
punch. A swimming team can rarely afford to concede two out of three
places in a dual meet even if first place points are assured. The same

argument holds for track

In cross country depth has its own peculiar effect.

Although only the first five finishers count in the scoring, it can be
vital to have men high up in the field in order to raise an opponent’s score.

Another practical aspect of the situation is the competition a strong
bench insures. The best times are turned in when a runner or swimmer
is being pushed, either by a strong opponent or a second stringer looking

for a

rting slot. A wrestler will improve his timing and his execution

if his starting role is threatened or he feels a starting berth within his

reach

Of course from another viewpoint a bench is essential: how can you

have a

sketball scrimmage with eight guys on the squad? A lacrosse

team or hockey team would be vulnerable without second middies or an-

other scoring line

Less tangible benefits are the considerations of morale and spirit. If

all the g

ys on a team don’t have the will or desire to win it becomes

difficult to motivate the starting players with a winning attitude.

Icers Beat West Chester State;
Generate High-Powered Offense

BY GEORGE LANE

Success finally smiled on the Bi-
son Hockey Club last week as they
picked up three of a possible four
points in the league standings by
tying Villanova 4-4 and beating
West Chester State 3-0.

The Bisons led four times in the
Villanova game, but had to settle
for the tie on a disputed goal scored
by Villanova late in the third
period.

The first period was almost over
before Bison defenseman Floyd
Wallace put the Blue in front 1-0
on a great individual effort. The
teams traded two goals in the
second period and one more in the
first half of the third to put the
game at 43 for the Bisons. As the
final buzzer neared, a Blue victory
looked imminent. But Villanova
bounced back, as they had done all
evening, and scored one last time,
sending the Bisons home with a

Things looked much better on
Sunday, however, as the Bisons
faced West Chester. They combined
a powerful offense with a tight,
close-checking defense and goalie
George Lane kicked out all 17 West
Chester shots as the Bisons re-
corded their first shutout victory
ever in league competition.

The Bisons scored before West
Chester had even had a shot on
goal as Jim Davenport took a shot
from the point that Dave ‘Dump’
Simpkins, standing in front of the
net, appeared to tip in. Although
the referee awarded the goal to
Davenport, the result was the
same; Bisons 1, West Chester 0.

They added one more in the first

West Chester was a bit more
sparked in the middle session as
they held the Bisons scoreless, but
constant Bison pressure finally
tagged them for a third one in the
third period on a 15-footer by Gerry
Stevick.

West Chester twice came within
inches of scoring in the third
period, once on a shot that de-
flected off Lane’s glove and bounc-
ed behind him, the other on a re-
bound shot placed between his leg
and the post. Both times, however,
Lane was just able to turn around
in time to bat the puck away or
cover it with his glove before it
rolled into the net.

The 41 shots on goal are the most
shots taken by the Bisons this
season and only the spectacular
play of West Chester goalie Pete
Reuter kept the game from being
a rout. The Bisons hope to make
a habit of this kind of performance
as they look to make it two in a
row against the Academy of the
New Church on Monday.

Let's Get It Straight

WHAT PRICE PEACE?

Quzsriow: What about the U.N. and other peace-making
organizations? Do you think they will ever succeed in

bringing peace to the world?

Answer: In this matter of peace-making, let’s not fool our-
selves, The peace the world wants to promote and the
peace that God speaks about in the Bible are two different

things.

The world thinks of peace as the absence of war,

a state of non-aggression in which nations are free to pur-
sue their own internal policies without fear of attack.

But Christ’s peace has
nothing to do with freedom
from suffering. He says so
Himself, in John 16:33. “In
the world you shall have trib-
ulation: but be of good cheer;
I have overcome the world.”
His peace comes to us, not be-
cause of favorable circum-
stances but in spite of unfav-
orable ones. Even in war,
His followers may have
peace.

Christians must always be
peacemakers in this sense of
the word, bringing Christ’s
message ‘of reconciliation
with God to a troubled world.
This does not mean they
should not engage in efforts
to promote international

in the limited

the real difficulty lies still
deeper.

To be a peacemaker is to
bring the peace of God to the
hearts of men. But Chris-
tians need to be on their
guard, both within the
Church and in the world, that
peacemaking is not compro-
mising with evil at the ex-
pense of righteousness. Peace
is not a state of being re-
signed to evil for the sake of
avoiding open conflict. Peace
may actually necessitate war,
for peace apart from truth
and justice is a farce. The
evil that corrupts the world
is not fostered mainly by bad
men but by those who will
never take their stand upon
principle and dare the conse-
quences.

Concert Atmosphere
Detracts from Show

By DAVID LOGAN

The atmosphere on campus was
*not conducive to an enjoyable con-
cert. Things around here border a
little on the paranoid. Plus all the
short changing season ticket holders
were getting because of the early
and shortened show. But all that
aside, the concert barely missed
leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

Kathy Smith entertained for the
first half hour of the Chicago show.
She brought a pleasant folk delivery
with very good flute accompani-
ment

This was all but drowned out by
the loud drone of conversation from
the rightfully impatient crowd.
However, being rightfully impatient
doesn’t give license for talking,
shouting suggestions to the per-
former and obviously sarcastic ap-
plause.

But Bucknell audiences seem to
think they have that license. Kathy
Smith must have felt like someone
& the seashore trying to sing ac-
companied by the roar of the ocean.
The ocean just isn’t going to stop,
so she either sings with it or leaves.
She had enough composure to let
the children have their own way.

Then, after what seemed like an
eternity of frustration, Chicago
finally appeared. Having seen Chi-
cago late this summer I knew es-
sentially what to expect. A smooth,
professional, adequate show. The
first show’s music was good, al-
though they relied heavily on old
material. The second set had more
musie from the new Chicago II
album

The music was performed well,
and the group did their hour and a
half bit, including encore, and split.

The only solo of note, beside the
standard piano intro to “Does Any-
body Really Know What Time It
Is?” and the tremendous flute part
in “It Better End Soon,” was lead
guitarist Terry Kath trying to come
off as some sort of Top 40 Alvin

Adaptation of Greek Tragedy

‘Trojan Women’ Depicts Anti-War Attitude

By LINDA ANNE CAPUTO

The members of Cap and Dagger
will present Jean Paul Sartre’s ad-
aptation of Euripides’ Trojan Wo-
men Thursday, March 11, Friday,
March 12, and Saturday, March 13
at 8:30 p.m. in Coleman Theatre.
In addition to these evening per-
formances, a matinee show will be
held on Saturday, March 13, at 2:00
p.m

Trojan Women, subtitled “A
Tragedy of What It Means to Win
a War,” relates the plight of the
Trojans after the fall of Troy and
depicts Euripides’ anti-war attitude.

According to Harvey Powers, di-
rector of the play, Sartre’s recent
adaptation of this Greek tragedy
will be used since it gives a con-
temporary tone to the original text,
allowing it to become immediately
meaningful and relevant to the
twentieth century audience.

The cast for this anti-war play

consists of the following: the Tro-
jans - Hecuba, Terry Ellis; Cas-
sandra, Joan Billig; Andromache,
Sally Gudbrandsen; Astynax, Ni-
cholas Pinter; and Helen, Nancy
Henry; the Greeks Menelaus,
Charles Pollock; Talthybios, Robert
Colgan; the Soldiers ip Dorsey,
Ron Hornbeck, Moonves,
Marc Powers Prowant.

Ballet, Chorale Combine Talents
To Perform ‘Carmina Burana’

The University Chorale—under
the direction of Allen W. Flock will
«mbine with the Pennsylvania Bal-
let to perform the Carl Orff cantata
“Carmina Burana’, staged by
choreographer John Butler, in Dav-
is Gymnasium at 8:15 p.m. Mon-
day, March 1.

This dramatic cantata by Carl
Orff, involving both sacred and
earthy scenes from medieval mon-
astic life, was first choregraphed
by John Butler fifteen years ago
for the New York City Opera. First
danced by the Pennsylvania Ballet
in 1966, it has become a favorite &
natural sell-out for the Company in
its own season at the Academy of
Music and Temple University Music
Festival, now being performed for
the first time on its tours. Chore-
ggraphically, Carmina is a mix-
ture of the modern dance idiom and
classic-dance imagery. It should
be noted, then perhaps forgotten,
that John Butler is classified as a
“‘modern-dance choreographer”. He
is a product of the Martha Graham
Company, first and foremost of
modernists, but he created Car-
mina Burana for classically trained
and classically-oriented dancers,
which demonstrates the versatility
of these keen young artists.

The company’s roster is interna-
tional; it’s dancers come from
Yugoslavia, France, Australia, Jap-

an ,Brazil, and more than a dozen
states in the United States. The
repertoire highlights the most sig-
nificant choreography of George
Balanchine, Anthony Tudor, Ivan-
ov, Petipa, modernists John Butler
and Anna Kokolow, and the com-
pany’s own ballet master, Robert
Rodham.

In addition to “Carmina Burana”
the dancers will perform ‘Les

International

Sylphides’’, Michel Fokine’s dream-
like ballet and a highlight of mod-
ern repertoires of ballet companies
around the world.

Maurice Kaplow is musical di-
rector of the Ballet and will lead
the company’s symphony orchestra
and direct the University Chorale
in their part of “Carmina.” Mr.
Kaplow is a former violinist of the
Philadelphia Orchestra.

Weekend

Explores ‘Third World’

By LISSA BLOCK

This spring International Club is
sponsoring a weekend devoted to
the “Third World,” similar to Col-
loquy in its approach.

On April 1 through April 4, guests
from many universities, foreign
countries, the Peace Corps, and
religiously affiliated groups will in-
form the University community of
the conditions in the Third World,
a political term referring to those
countries which are not allied with
major powers of either the free or
the Communist worlds. These areas,
including Latin America, India and
parts of Asia, Africa, and the Mid-
die East, are underdeveloped as a

result of their status.

The economic, sociological, and
political development of these coun-
tries will be the theme of the Third
World. Thursday and Friday will
be dedicated to lectures and panel
discussions, while movies and var-
ious representative cultural events
and exhibitions will be shown on
Saturday and Sunday.

The speakers come from various
backgrounds. Irving Horowitz, a
sociologist and author from Rutgers
University, will discuss the Three
Worlds of Development, the topic
of his recent work. Edisson H.
Osorio wil express his concern, as

A ‘Pass’ System - - Why Not?

It really doesn’t matter who you
ask—whether it be faculty, students,
or administrators—one of the biggest
problems at any university is the grad-
ing system. So why have grades at all?
A convincing argument for an arbitrary,
ill-defined grading system simply does
not exist.

We are presently experimenting
with pass-fail courses. The reasons be-
hind our experimentation seem, at first
glance, to be sound. In order to evaluate
the feasibility of pass-fail, a controlled
study of this system should be made—
or so the reasoning goes. However, when
viewed from the point of view of the stu-
dent who has three graded courses and
one pass-fail course, this situation
changes. When academic pressure in-
creases past a certain degree, certain
courses are going to have to suffer.
Which courses? The answer is obvious.

This may be the reason that the
year-old experiment in pass-fail is yield-
ing discouraging results. The solution to
this dilemma is simple: the grading sys-
tem should be abolished and pass-fail in-
stituted for all courses at the University.
In this manner, students would not ne-
glect any one sourse because grade moti-
vation kept them working on three other
courses, or two others, or one other.
Students would again be working hard,
but without all of the problems, restric-
tions, an worry that grades cause pre-
sently.

Any student who takes a continu-
ous-progress course must achieve a
“level of mastery” of the subject in order
to pass the course. The differences

among students are manifested in the
amount of time it takes for students to
complete the course. In regular courses
all students complete the course in the
same time span, but the achievement
differs. In the latter case, all students
must proceed at the same rate. Superior
students are slowed down to the point
of boredom, while slow students are
pushed to the point of despair. Some of
these “slow” students are able to attain
a level of proficiency in most subjects—
if they are given sufficient time to un-
derstand the material. Too often they
give up all hope and fail a course, not
because they cannot understand the ma-
terial, but because they cannot proceed
at the same rate as the rest of the class.

Several universities in this country,
among them Reed College and Wesleyan
University, presently operate on a total
pass-fail type tem. We propose that
this University go a step further and in-
stitute »ompletely continuous-progress.

ystem. In fact, why not just a
“pass’ system? When any student attains
sufficient mastery of the subject to pass
the course he should be given a ‘‘com-
pleted” on his record. If a student can-
not complete the course within a certain
time he doesn’t get penalized for it, he
jst doesn’t get credit for it.

Why should the University have
grades? A stuent needs thirty-two “C's”
(a cum GPA of 2.0) to graduate. Why
not make it just thirty-two “passes” or
“completed’s?” We would like to see the
Committee on Academic Regulations re-
evaluate the reasons for the present
grading system and the reasons for
changing it.

Once in the Bucknell student
body as a whole has shown its
phistication by being the
act of the three which per-
formed at Friday’s concert. For
those of you who don’t know by
now, we are referring to the gross
impoliteness shown Kathy Smith,
the intro act for Chicago. Admit-
tedly, her act was anything but in-
spiring, but when you consider the
noise level and the open hostility
which greeted her and persisted
throughout her act, it is almost im-
possible to make a really valid
judgement as to her true ability.
But worse yet, the poor job the
sound people did concerning her
guitar mike was _ inexcusable
especially when they replaced her
first mike with another one which
also didn’t function properly
However, probably the biggest
problem was that the Concert Com-
mittee very conveniently forgot to
tell anybody that there in fact was
an intro act—a minor oversight!?
We can only say, “Bucknell, a job
well done; keep up the good work!”

An open letter to:

Professor John W. Tilton
Director, January Program

Dear Sir:

Bucknell’s January Program as it
now stands is unique in the United
States. For this reason, the Class of
1971 thought it imperative that cer-
tain considerations be kept in mind
during any re-evaluations that may
occur concerning the aforemention-
ed program.

A poll was taken at registration
this summer in an attempt to di-
scern the extent of interest and

participation in the January Pro-
gram. It should be taken into ac-
count, when evaluating the results,
that many students did not bother
to fill out this questionnaire, there-
by giving an inaccurate picture of
what actually was accomplished
durir anuary. In addition, a large
number of students did not sign up
for official projects, yet studied on
their own. There is no way of know-
ing about these activities if the
students did not fill out the ques-
tionnaire

The possibility of changing the
January Program (for example, by
making it mandatory or by initiat-
ing a grading system) is perhaps
being considered. This course of
action might have detrimental effect
by stifling the system and destroy-
ing the objectives intrinsic in its
make-up. i.e. that of creating an

Elections
To the Editor

I would like to call the Univers-
ity’s attention to the recent repre-
hensible actions of John Dunlop,
dean of student affairs.

Last week, as the deadline for fil-
ing as a candidate for student gov-
ernment elections (Mon., Feb. 22),
several students were approached
by Dunlop and were asked to run
for President of the ABS Congress.
Dunlop’s motives seem to have
stemmed from his concern that one
of those who had already declared
their candidacy was likely to win
and that individual was ‘‘too
radical.’ Dunlop realizes, and prob-
ably rightly so, that his job as dean
would be much easier were an ‘“‘ad-
ministrative nigger” to assume the
Presidency.

He was unsuccessful in finding
someone who would play the role
his way, but the idea of his even
attempting to install a puppet gov-
ernment deserves close attention by
all. If he is to be considered repre-
sentative of the University adminis-
tration, it would seem that they no
longer can retain the confidence of
the students.

Sincerely,
Paul Osher

Scholarship
To the Editor:

It is suprising that the ABS has
$7000 that, in a sense, it “doesn’t
know how to spend.” It is well-
known that this University does not
have much money for financial aid.
While $7000 is not that much, may I
suggest that this amount would ful-
ly support three or four students
for the Fall semester? I sandwich
my idea in among the others ABS
is probably receiving from organiza-
tions requesting funds for their pet
expansion plans. Unfortunately, it
is also well-known that this cam-
pus is hung-up somewhere between
sorority rush and outer space.

Chicago Concert

(Continued from Page 1)

Lee. His riffs seemed mechanical,
being done only to give people who
think good music is good solo work
something to be happy about.
Kath is a good lead, but not
great. The vocals were all good
backed by the strong brass section,
that, although they cracked a few
times, did an overall good job.
What was really unfortunate,
though, was the crummy sound sys-
tem that sacrificed much clarity for
much volume. The highlight of the
evening came pretty early
Between numbers some of Buck-
nell’s crew of vocal groupies chirp-
ed up with shouts of “I’m a Man.”
I was very pleased to see Terry
Kath tell them that that song was
no longer part of their repertoire.
Jt was quite a surprise considering
Chicago’s emergence as one of the
top commercial groups in the coun-
try (judging from new album
prices, singles cut from old albums,
etc.).
A final comment has to be made
concerning style. Chicago seemed

to really enjoy performing, and ex-
cept for a few peace symbols
flashed and several interjections of
“Out of Sights”, they refrained
from prostituting themselves too
much. They had polish and style
that a nice conventional school like
Bucknell would (and did) eat up.
However, even this smooth profes-
sionalism I found more tolerable
than the cold professionalism and
aloofness of the Band back in No-
vember.

All in all, Friday night was a
satisfactory evening from a musi-
cal point of view. But, the music
was never quite able to rise above
the shoddiness of the rest of the
concert’s environment

Another Tight One!

Leopards Pounce Past Matmen;
Bisons Aim for Winning Season

By JOHN GARDNER

Once again the wrestling team en-
countered a formidable foe and bat-
tled to a thrilling, yet equally frus-
trating outcome. This time the La-
fayette Leopards decisioned the Bi-
sons 17 to 16. The meet proved even
closer than the final score indicates
because of disputed decisions by the
referee in three of the individual
matches.

Tom Wason has begun to display
his true potential. He dominated the
entire match against his opponent,
O’Brien, who captured fourth place
last year in the Pennsylvania high
school tournament. Wason showed
considerable strength in his take-
down ability and overall condition-
ing in winning 6-4.

Jim Northridge and Mark Ram-
age both wrestled previous state
champions. Northridge lost 9-4 after
an exciting toss and turn match.
With 1:10 left in the bout North-
ridge trapped Munn in a quick
cradle and flattened his back to the
mat, but the ref was too busy giving
the reversal points to notice that

eree failed to give him what ap-
peared to be valid predicament
points.

George Ballentine, John Skinner,
and Mark Currie were all decisioned
by their Lafayette predators. Skin-
ner, as did Northridge, had his man
pinned but again the ref was off in
Never Never Land and failed to
award predicament or near fall
points.

Wrestling at Bucknell used to be
a joke. Trent Smith came along as
coach and started piecing together
a team. The Bison community soon
boasted of an AC champion, Tom
Rivoire, and a proud fourth place
berth for the entire team (even
though both co-captains were in-
jured during the season and couldn’t
wrestle! )

Bucknell now has this new coach
named Rich Schumacher. ‘“Schu’
was the National Heavyweight
champion last year and the
wrestlers feel he’s about the great-
est guy they could have for a coach,

Sure he’s still young and inex-

perienced at coaching but you
should have seen him at some of
the meets, 260 pounds jitter-bugging
along the mat’s edge, while shout-
ing encouragement and chiding him-
self for forgetting to demonstrate
a certain move during practice.

And coach isn’t the only inex-
perienced member of this year’s
team. With ten weight classes in
collegiate wrestling, there are a
total of fifteen grapplers who report
for BU’s practice, seven freshmen,
three sophs, three juniors, and one
senior.

The fact that this year’s team lost
two matches by one point, one
match by two points, and another
by one match points to their tre-
mendous effort and potential

So things do appear to be chang-
ing for Bison wrestling, at least for
the team itself. As far as the spec-
tators are concerned, they’ve re-
mained the same. For those of you
who haven’t witnessed the change,
I can only say I’m sorry that you
weren’t there to see it yourself.

Cagers Fall to

Broncos,

Host Delaware Tomorrow

By KEN DOAK

The Herd hoopsters suffered a
62-60 setback Saturday at Rider, as
the Broncos’ Steve Jefferson netted
a 15-footer with 27 seconds remain-
ing to turn back a Bison comeback
bid.

During the first 11 minutes, the
contest was a back-and-forth strug-
gle, as Chris Riley and Jim Dono-
van led the attack, and Harvey
Carter controlling the backboards.

However, BU went cold in the
scoring department, and Rider
grabbed a 35-29 halftime lead.

The Broncos’ Bill Katz hit on
several jumpers early in the second
half to help extend the Rider lead
to 50-40.

At that point, the Bisons ran off a
16-4 burst, as Bill Peterson, Jack
Darnall, Riley, and Carter each
netted 4 points.

Six points by Jefferson around a
lone Carter free throw gave Rider
a 3-point lead, before Dave Green-
wood deadlocked the game at 60-60
with a crucial 3-point play.

With 45 seconds left, Greenwood
missed a shot from underneath, and
two BU follow-ups were missed, be-

Rutgers Routs Swimmers;
Mermen Await Engineers

By MARK KNODERER

Oh, there are good days and there
are bad days. What Rutgers did to
the swimming team on Saturday
might be better termed “atrocity,”
but in any case the Scarlet Knights
ended the Bison’s five meet win
streak, 82-31.

The team’s lone first place came
in the 20 backstroke, where Bob
Young, after only two weeks of
training, made his debut with a
sparkling time of 2:08.5. Other than
that the team’s big guns were ef-
fectively silenced.

Coach Russell had predicted a

“buzzsaw” at Rutgers, and if the
diving team was an example, the
team should have known something
was amiss

On Thursday Ron Farr sprained
his ankle, and had to dive with it
heavily bandaged. When warming
up before the meet Bob Richards
landed on his face when attempting
a 3% somersault, and required
medical attention.

There were several bright spots
for the Bisons, however. Young is
already approaching the form that
earned him the M.A.C. backstroke
championship last year.

Gary Norton sprints for the finish line. The rapidly improving freshman is
the first Bison to break 11 minutes in the 1000 yard free style.

Frosh Gary Norton continued his
remarkable improvement with a
time of 10:57.9 in the 1000 free, the
first Bison to break eleven minutes
this year,

Paul Landes had his fastest 200
free time, 1:53.3, and Peter O’Keef-
fe turned in his best 500, 5:09.5.
Skip Allen continued his steady im-
provement with a time of 2:14.0 in
the butterfly, making him a threat
at the M.A.C.’s.

Dute Otto swam the backstroke in
2:09.4, his fastest time, and Matt
Slick glided to a 2:22.8 in the 200
breastroke.

Coach Russell said that the team
looked tired and was not “up” for
the meet. He also noted that the
improvement in the Rutger’s times
made the meet a rout more than a
poor showing by the team itself.

This week, however, the team will
begin to taper for the M.A.C.’s.
Last year’s winner, Lehigh, will
visit the Freas-Rooke naratorium
this Saturday at 1:30, in what will
definitely be a prelude to the
championship. Lehigh will be in
the midst of their taper also, so the
meet will be close until the final
event.

Risch Notes Concern
About Drug Situation

By CAROLYN PERNICE

Regarding the question of
whether drug use was of any bene-
fit to the academic community of
this University, Thomas J. Risch,
Dean of Men, stated there were
several reasons why he felt that
the use of drugs does not contribute
to the achievement of goals set
forth by the University

Continuing in the same vein, he
expressed the main purpose of the
University as being the ‘develop-
ment of the individual to his com-
plete potential.’

In an effort to show concern and
to stimulate action within the stu-
dent body, Dean Risch spoke earlier
this week in both a contact lecture
and an evening discussion in Lari-
son Hall.

He feels that the dependency
caused by drug usage is not com-
patible with the growth and for-
mation of a strong and stable in-
dividual. Closely connected with this
idea is the fact that “‘the existence
of drugs on campus has the po-
tential to stifle all the elements of
free inquiry and personal decision
that are necessary to individual de-
velopment.”

The potential, he said, is that the
campus is ripe for professional
pushers and the representatives of
organized crime who might try to
get the students “hooked’’ on the
more lethal and profitable drugs.

He went on to explain that “‘the
drug situation on campus only

erves to create an environment
that is not conducive to good mental
hygiene and therefore could act as
the catalyst of mounting fear and
anxiety in many people.”

He criticized the use of drugs as
“pollutants of our bodies that are
extremely detrimental.”

He said, “I wonder why people
who are interested in anti-pollution
and the environment are not as in-
volved in the protection of their
own bodies.”

In addition, Risch emphasized the
fact that the University, ‘as an
academic community open to social
reform and experimentation, should
take the lead in correcting the ills
of our society.”

Regarding the pressure society
and the University in particular, is
faced with, Risch feels that “‘this
pressure could be met and sur-
mounted in ways that are not so
harmful to the body and which aid
the development of the total person
Re his maximum capibilities.”

He offered no concrete solutions
to the drug problem, only chal-
lenges, ‘In hope that we here at
the University will soon learn to
create a climate where drugs aren’t
necessary and where people are
courageous enough to live as true
independent beings.”

Dean Thomas Risch stated his
views concerning drug usage on
campus at Tuesday’s Contact lec-
ture.

Election on Monday
Candidates Offer Views in Open Forum

ABS Uses Computer
To Help Count Votes

By CHARLES MUSSMAN

In order to increase the speed
and efficiency with which the ABS
election ballots are counted, this
year the student body will be mark-
ing their candidate choices on com-
puter cards. Craig Eby, ABS vice
President, made the decision to
computerize the election procedure
in the hopes that there would be
less confusion and fewer disputes
about the correctness of the ballot
count.

Charles Mussman, a student who
is employed by the Computer Cen-
ter as a programmer, was con-
tacted by Eby and has designed a
simple system which will use the
Sigma 7 computer to count the num-
ber of votes each candidate re-
ceives as well as the total number
of students voting in the election.
The computer will have the results

in less than two minutes.

This year, the ballots will have
to be punched at the Computer
Center, however this will be done
semi-automatically; all that will be
necessary is to divide the ballots
into piles according to candidate.
Next year, though, it is hoped that
perforated computer cards can be
used. These cards are able to be
punched without the use of any
machinery, simply by pressing out
the holes with a sharp pencil.

Write-ins will continue to be a
problem. Since there is no way to
easily program the computer to
recognize and record write-in votes
without humanly keypunching the
name onto a computer card, these
votes will continue to be counted by
hand.

Mark Dembert, President of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, the men’s leader-
ship honorary, emphasizes that this
is an experiment. Since ODK is in
charge of the ballot counting, they
will have to evaluate the new sys-
tem and decide whether or not
elections will be computerized in
the future

CAR Investigates Resolution

Majority Oppose Phys Ed Requirement

By SANDARA SELBY

The Association of Bucknell Stu-
dents passed a resolution advocat-
ing the abolition of the physical
education requirement for men and
women last October. A subcommit-
tee of the University Committee on
Academic Regulations was then
formed to investigate the resolution.

A questionnaire was distributed
to almost all students, and the ma-
jority of these questionnaires were
returned. Sixty-one per cent of the
women who replied opposed man-
datory physical education, and 68%
of the men who replied were also
against the requirement.

A majority of those who opposed
the requqirement, especially the wo-
men, said that they would partici-
pate in the physical education pro-
gram even if it was not mandatory.

As for distribution by class, fresh-
men men opposed mandatory phy-
sical education by a margin of 41,
and freshmen women were opposed
by 2-1. Among both senior men and
women answering the question-
naire, a bare majority opposed
mandatory physical education.

Wilder Discusses Understaffing
As Major Counseling Problem

By DAVID HAMMER

On a number of counts, this Uni-
versity’s Counseling Service does
not measure up to standards pro-
posed by a nationally-oriented task
force.

For example, ‘Guidelines for Uni-
versity and College Counseling Ser-
vices” suggests on its first page
that “the Counseling Service, like
any other department, requires pro-

#*essional qualified individuals in suf-
ficient numbers to provide the
necessary services.”

In Dr. David Wilder’s opinion as
director of the Counseling Service
here, the ratio of full-time Ph.D’s
jn the Counseling Service to stu-
dents “‘should be in the neighbor-
hood of one Ph.D. per 1,000 stu-
dents.”

Obviously, even such a minimum
ratio does not exist here; Wilder is
the only full-time Ph.D. (aided by
a graduate research assistant, part-
time, and a secretary) serving ap-
proximately 2,800 undergraduates.

By comparison, in an April, 1969
survey, Wilder discovered that at
least fourteen other private colleges
and universities with comparable
enrollments have 2.8 times this uni-
versity’s Counseling Service staff.
By this figuring, even if one more
full-time Ph.D. were added to the
Service here, the staff “‘would still
be at a lower level” than most
other comparative institutions.

This understaffing problem raises
some serious questions regarding
effectiveness. Whereas page five of
the tentative ‘Guidelines’ states
that ‘‘an integral responsibility of
the Counseling Service is generation
of research to determine the ef-
fectiveness of its services and to
improve those services,” Wilder
admits that ‘‘one distinct weakness
(due to understaffing) is in ‘follow-
up’ (subsequent evaluation of con-
sultation). We are not in a position
to take the time to adequately
evaluate the effectiveness of our

{Continued on Page 6)

The ABS, at its Wednesday night
meeting said that it ‘“‘has noted with
interest, the result of the physical
education survey sent to all stu-
dents, and expects that the sub-
committee report will reflect the
desires of the majority of the Uni-
versity’s men and women.”

The subcommittee is chaired by
Dr. Paul DeHoff, assistant profes-
sor of mechanical engineering. Fac-
ulty committee members include
Rober Latour, director of athletics,
Margaret Peck, instructor of wo-

men’s physical education, Dr. John
Murphy, assistant professor of En-
glish, and Dr. Meldrum Winstead,
professor of chemistry

In addition, two committee mem-
bers, Christine Ellison and Tom
Rivoire, were appointed by the phy-
sical education department, and
two students, Mike Holoszyc and
Beth Wright, by the ABS.

The subcommittee has met twice
and is still considering the results
of the questionnaire.

Dean Eckberg Retires
Committee Reviews Applications

By RICHARD DAY

With retirement of Dr. Herbert
Eckberg, Dean of the College of
Engineering near at hand the ad
hoc committee to nominate passible
replacements has been at work.

Their task is to examine, inter-
view and ultimately nominate two
or three of the approximate 75 ap-
plicants for the position. The nom-
inations will then go to the Board
of Trustees where the final decision
will be made

When received, the committee
members, in closed session, review
each application.

According to Dr. Smith, “The

Dean Herbert Eckberg is retiring
as head of the College of Engine-
ering this August. The committee
is in the process of looking for a
replacement for the position.

criteria upon which we will base
our final decision is many-faceted.”’
The group is looking for a man (or
woman) preferably in his late
thirties or early forties who has
had administrative as well as re-
cent teaching experience. “We ex-
pect him to teach and/or conduct
research,” said Dr. Smith, “‘conse-
quently, we want him to be able
to be ‘in touch’ with the student
body.””

To facilitate this, the committee
also hopes that the nominee will
come from a liberal arts field so
as to better understand the prob-
lems and frustrations of the ma-

jority of the students at the uni-
versity
According to Dr. Smith, the com-
mittee, which was formed about six
months ago, has worked extremely
well and very efficiently, being “re-
markably free from politicing.”’
He commended all the committee
members as well as the faculty and
department chairmen for their help.

For ABS Abolishment

As the annual ABS elections ap-
proach, concerned students again are
searching for an alternative form of
government which would be less deceiv-
ing and hopefully more meaningful than
the ABS.

The ABS as it now stands serves
three main functions. First, it adminis-
tears the funds to which every student
contributes through the General Fee.
Second, it acts as a screening and ap-
pointing mechanism which, in theory,
sees that most qualified students serve
on the proper administrative committees.
And third, it acts as the Official Repre-
sentative Voice of the entire student
body.

Bucknellians have led themselves to
believe not only that the ABS is truly
representative, but also that it has some
real power other than doling out; money.
Both assumptions are incorrect. Can an
organization which could not engender
enough student interest to readily ob-
tain two candidates for its second most
important office be called truly repre-
sentative? A truly representative body
would have to be as apathetic as the stu-
dents it represents, and therefore would
not exist in the first place. Or, for that
matte, has this organiqation which
sought to sharpen the reflection of its
constituency by adding Living Unit Rep-
resentatives—only to be burdened with
popularity contest winners and dead
wood (witness the alacrity with which
the Senate has been dealt)—-become any
more representative than the unopposed
oligarcy which preceded it? We doubt it.

Perhaps a more honest form of stu-
dent organization would be a funding
committee that so called itself and avoid-
ed delusions of representativeness and
popular voice. This Student Funding
Committee (SFC?) would have annual-
ly elected members and would recognize

itself as a necessary administrative
agency—and only that. Similarly, a com-
mittee could also be annually elected
whose sole duty would be to screen and
appoint students to the various com-
munity bodies in which student perspec-
tive should be present.

On important matters which de-
mand that the student body as a whole
take a position, the entire student body
would vote in a referendum: the sound of
the Bucknell student body is not one
voice or a handful of voices, but 3000
voices. A petition signed by a significant
proportion of students would be able to
initiate such a referendum.

Minor policy statements might be
drawn up at community-wide open meet-
ings at which everyone in attendance

would have a vote. Of course, since there

would be no elected representatives
morally obligated to attend such a meet-
ing, the undoubtedly small attendance
at these meetings would reflect the rela-
tive importance (to the student body)
of the issues being discussed. (Although
ABS meetings are open to the entire
student body, the lack of non-elected rep-
resentation at these meetings might ex-
press the relative importance of the work
of ABS.)

Such a system, where the refer-
endum would be the major outlet of stu-
dent sentiment, would not only allow for
more accurate reflection of genuine stu-
dent opinion, but it would also free those
truly interested students from the
shackles of our current government so
that they could serve on the very com-
mittees that the ABS is now having such

a difficult time filling. All interested,

nonapathetic students would be much
more useful as functioning members of
such committees than as power-seeking
individuals presuming to speak for the
entire student body.

THE SIDESHOW——s=*”

Bucknell at Play

By DAVID WEINBERGER

The Bison had never been so crowded, except for the year before. A
snowstorm of people: if it only would all melt together, like spring thaw.

People huddle, pushed together by the walls. A naked person would
be dressed by the outside of his neighbor’s clothing. Sorority packaged
girls, gifts under the Christmas tree, on tip-toe on the ledge around the
Bison; singing, their toes curl over the edge like divers about to push off.

But the sorority girls won’t jump in. Around them, the audience of a
strip show; guys hope that the barrier between them and the lines of girls
will remain so that they can look without fear.

Beta Gamma Beta Gamma Beta Gamma Rah Rah. Cheering for
cheers,waiting for the football team to come out. But they don’t appear.
We're all in the Bison, cheering for the contest because when there’s no
game that’s the best you can do.

Doric columns of legs, the cosmetics counter of the Bison. Sorority
eye-make-up, worn on a pin on the breast where all eyes now turn.
Voyeur, sports fan, exotic dancer, Avon lady, all brought together under
one roof like a banquet in Howard Johnson’s.

Meanwhile we invaded Laos so we invaded Lewisburg. Gathering in
front of the library with revolutionary placards and expressions, the brave
soldiers prepare for the Long March.

A leader appears, stepping up onto the brick fence in front of the
library, placed there to defend the library from entrance through any-
thing except the doors. A statement of purpose is handed out and read
quickly, for these are veterans: the ones who made it through the meet-
ing the night before. “We all know why we are here today.”

The day is cold enough to put out a fire, but in the march to win by
endurance, the body’s discomfort is the proof of rectitude.

A crowd is gathered because we “have to do something.”’ Another
leader speaks and says that he thinks it might be a good idea if the
demonstrators link arms in front of the Post Office Building. Someone
asks why and a leader on the ground says, ‘“‘There’s no point in discuss-
ing it,’ meaning that we have spent enough time taking, now let’s do
something. Do, act. Thinking is not doing. Changing yourself is not chang-
ing. Act, because sitting and wondering are more painful than a short
walk on a cold day. Act, because by donating an hour and a half of time
we can to help end a war, although the real war will go on burning our
souls.

Milling in front of the library, Bucknell slays the ghost of apathy.

A student plays piano while we try not to slurp our drinks at the
Class of ’72 Coffeehouse. White tablecloths and someone went to New-
berry’s to buy red candles. Like a restaurant we sit at tables; in the back
of the room, like at a poetry reading, we sit on the floor.

A guitar player sings very nicely, while the other local talent waits in
the sitting room reading a magazine. In between goes an officer of the
class carrying an empty dispenser marked Tea. “More punch for the
coffeehouse!””

Reactions

Tuesday evening, the Bucknellian met with the
candidates running for the ABS offices of president,
vice-president, and treasurer. The following are our re-
actions to the various candidates.

President: Jim Lackritz suffers from lack of ex-
perience, and his views on most issues would be suf-
ficient to bring the University into the nineteen-sixties.

30b Nachshin has experience and seems to have all
the right views . . . the fact that he is a seasoned poli-
tician may be the detriment of the University.

Vice-President: Bucceri and Pais agree (on the
issues).

Treasurer: Chuck Resnick would be a good book-
keeper, and his views are sufficient to bring us into the
Great Society era.

John Sprout “was unable to attend” the meeting.

Not exceedingly often does a

nonetheless, it seems necessary for
me to do so.

The Bucknellian of December 11

FEEDBACK: Logan

Dear Editor:

This is written to protest the
Bucknellian’s act of “censorship”
on my review of Chicago concert
in the February 23 issue. The en-
tirety of the first paragraph and
parts of the second were deleted
without my knowledge. I think con-
sultation was in order, particularly
since beginning an article in what
originally was the second paragraph
did little justice to whatever style
it originally had as well as making
the general thrust of the article
(the bad “environment” for the
concert) unclear.

The reason the material was de-
leted, as I understand it, were sup-
posed inaccuracies in the descrip-
tions and comments made. Com-
ments and concerns voiced, may I
add, by a number of Bucknellians
as well as myself. I was willing
then, as I am now to take full re-
sponsibility for anything I wrote.
However, it should be the responsi-
bility of the Concert Committee

(who were largely the subjects of
my commentary) to justify the ac-
tions they took in presenting the
concert. Had my contentions been
proven false, I would have gladly
retracted them.

In the interest of voicing the con-
cern of members of the Bucknell
community, though, these com-
ments were made, and I felt that
these concerns deserved coverage
in the Bucknellian.

However, the most dissapointing
element of this whole affair was the
capitulation of the Bucknellian to
the wishes of the Concert Commit-
tee. It is understandable that the
Committee wishes to preserve their
public image. I feel strongly,
though, that no instifution is above
criticism, and it is unlike the Buck-
nellian to avoid coverage of student
concern with these established in-
stitutions.

Hopefully the outgrowth of all this
will be not only a more responsive
and responsible Concert Committee
but, as well, a Bucknellian policy
that doesn’t sacrafice journalistic
courage in the face of pressure.

Sincerely yours,
David Logan

However, ever since the disclos-

Bucknell special student had been
playing James Bond for the Justice

have risen quite dramatically.

I wish to stress that I selected
these persons as “‘victims’” because
they all seemed innocuous and/or
beneficient. To the best of my know-
ledge, none of them is an under-
cover agent. I urge my fellow para-
noids to stop hassling Len Smolen
(Marchand and Birdsall being no
longer around to be hassled), and to
forget about the whole damned
column.

ABS Treasurer

To the Editor:

As Vice-President of the ABS and
Chairman of the Elections Com-
mittee, I would like to publicly
clarify a situation that caused some
confusion of late. According to arti-
cle II, Section 5d of the ABS By-
Laws, “The slate shall consist of
at least two names for each po-
sition to be filled.”

As many of you are aware, Chuck
Resnick was unopposed as a candi-
date for Treasurer until Monday
when a petition was received from
John Sprout. At the time of the
announcement of the preliminary
slate no other students had expres-
sed an interest to run for Treasurer
so the Nominating Committee at-
tempted to encourage a candidacy.
Meeting with failure in this attempt,
several members of the committee,
myself included, were at odds as
to what to do and conveyed this
feeling to Resnick. He was advised
to ask people he knew to submit
their names as candidates to allow
for a “legal” election. He was ex-
tremely reluctant to act on this
suggestion but was persuaded into
mentioning the nature of the situa-
tion to his friends.

Learning of the need for a second

name to appear on the ballot to
validate Resnick’s candidacy, John
Sprout, a freshman who lives down
the hall, submitted his name. A
petition was obtained and circulated
and his name now appears on the
ballot.

I hope this explanation frees
Chuck from any doubts which might
have been cast his way and the
whole affair will become a closed
subject from this point on.

Incidently, I feel the aforemen-
tioned section of the by-laws is in-
appropriate and should be elimin-
ated. I cannot think of a true
rationale for a mandatory two can-
didate slate, since write-ins are al-
lowed, the voter is always provided
a choice. Unfortunately, by the time
I realized this it was too late to
change it for the upcoming election.

Sincerely,
Craig Eby
ABS Vice-President

Chicago
To the Editor:

David Logan’s review of the Chi-
cago concert brought a few points
to my mind which I feel impelled to
relate. These center around Mr¢
Logan’s idea that the crowd had no
right to voice their dissatisfaction
with “folksinger” Kathy Smith. To
me, the idea that a person, after
paying $5.50, is not entitled to voice
his dissatisfaction with an act is
ludicrous.

If a person is allowed to voice his
approval (by applause), it would
seem to be markedly hypocritical
not to boo an act which the specta-
tor viewed as inferior. Just as in
sports, where booing is an accepted
happening, entertainment should not
be above reproach. After all, the
spectator did pay his money.

It seems to me, however, that
Smith was not booed for any. lack
of ability, as the grumblings started,
before she had even started to sing.”
What she encountered was probably
the dissatisfaction of a crowd which,
already shafted by being forced to
attend a shortened ‘first’ show, saw
their precious time being shortened
further by an act which no one had
told them of. Unfortunately they
chose to voice their frustrations at
an innocent bystander (Smith).

Perhaps it the audience had taken
the time to think, they would have
booed the individual responsible for
the situation (Andrew Meyer). Des-

FEEDBACK: Dunlop

Clarification
To the Editor:

As a member of the University
whose attention has recently been
called to the “reprehensible ac-
tions” of John Dunlop, Dean of
Student Affairs, I would like to elicit
clarification from Paul Osher re-
garding the specifics of his accusa-
tion. I am sure Mr. Osher will be
more than happy to answer a few
simple questions in this regard,
that is, presuming he subscribes to
that hackneyed phrase: ‘‘innocent”’
until proven ‘“‘guilty” (whatever
that means). The questions:

1) What was (were) the source(s)
of his information?

2) Did Dunlop approach students
and solicit their candidacy for the
Presidency of the ABS Congress?

3) Who were the students spoken
of in his letter?

4) Did Dunlop actually submit the
judgment that one of the candidates
who had already declared was ‘‘too
radical’? If so, when and whom?

5) What is an “administrative
nigger’? Is the other candidate to
be termed such? How shall the
candidate in question be character-
ized?

6) Is it within the realm of pos-
sibility that the Dean of Student
Affairs, through the nefarious co-
vert subterfuge suggested, could ac-
tually perpetrate the election of a
“puppet government’?

7) What are the boundaries on the
participation and interests of the
ABS advisor, as he (Osher) sees
them?

Should the answers to these ques-
tions conclusively verify the accusa-
tions alleged by Mr. Osher, I be-
lieve the University owes him a
sincere thanks for his bringing these
deplorable facts to our attention.
Indeed, it might be appropriate for
all of us to join him in his public
censure. Should the contentions
prove inadequate, inaccurate, or
even indefensible, NO LESS than
the converse should prevail.

@ It is quite unfortunate that such
a strong conclusion was not reached
with a more convincing display of
fact (as opposed to rumor, for ex-
ample). It’s a good thing universi-
ties foster free thought and open-
mindedness or else we might be
susceptible to internalizing as true
any idle gossip that comes down the
pike!

Very sincerely,
Chuck Resnick

Rejection
To the Editor:

After careful consideration I find
that I must reject the accusations
made by Paul Osher in his letter
of Tuesday.

I have had a close working rela-
tionship with Dean Dunlop for al-
most two years in the areas of the
Independent Men’s Christmas For-
mal and the University Committee
on Student Affairs.

In both of these cases and in in-
formal discussions I have found the
Dean to be frank and open. One
might charge him with being too
cautious at times but hardly would
I call his actions reprehensible.

Even if one assumes that the
Dean is guilty as charged, I fail to
see what difference it makes en-
couraging someone to run for of-
fice is perfectly fair. Further, I fail
to believe that anyone on this cam-
pus is so mindless that they could
be influenced and used as an “ad-
ministration nigger.”

In short, I lack confidence in ad-
ministrators when the facts justify
it and not on the basis of innuendo.
I could find no facts to substantiate
the charges against Dean Dunlop.

Don Thompson

Disturbing
To the Editor:

As a member of the ABS I am
very interested and disturbed by
the accusations Paul Osher has
made concerning Dean Dunlops in-
volvement in the current ABS elec-
tions and I don’t believe they should
go unchallenged. If the charges
Osher has raised are true, then J
certainly feel that the Congress of
the ABS must review its associa-
tion with Dean Dunlop who is its
advisor. If, however, Osher can
not substantiate his accusations,
then I feel it is Osher who should
be denounced. In any event, I think
Osher’s letter insults the intelli-
gence of the University community.
For Osher to expect the student
body to accept these charges with-
out him producing any evidence is
both outrageous and ridiculous.
What I am asking Mr. Osher to do
is either to “put up or shut up.” I
think Osher is obligated to produce
the names of the students involved,
a clearer idea of the conversations
which transpired between them and
the Dean and if possible even the
dates on which these meetings oc-
curred. If Osher is unable to pro-
vide this information, because as
I suspect Osher based his accusa-
tions on either rumors or complete
falsehoods, then I would hope that
he would be man enough to apolo-
gize not only to Dean Dunlop but
also to the University community

Po TL TH 0108

for attempting to smear the good
name of a man who has served this
University and its student body so
well.
I anxiously await Mr. Osher’s re-
ply.
Sincerely,

Pres. Class of '72

Student View

To the Editor:

We are shocked by the blantant
and unfounded accusations of Paul
Osher in his letter of February 23.
His condemnation was based, as he
admits, solely on rumor. The letter
is unjustifiably slanderous.

Yet his attack has cast consider-
able doubt on the integrity of the
Dean of Student Affairs, and of
University administrators in gen-
eral.

Whether this was done to sway
the results of the impending election
or to case certain inuendos against
all administrators, we cannot be
sure.

More facts are needed before the
accusation can bear any validity.
We believe the matter demands
either proof of the allegations or a
formal apology. Until such time, we
hope the University will not be pre-
judiced by these currently unfound-
ed slanders. Mr. Osher, exactly who
is manipulating puppets?

The light is on a new guitar player, not quite as good, as we whisper

Professors Consider Establishment
Of Collective Bargaining Measures

By ANN WENGERT
and HOLLY HACH
The American Association of Uni-
versity Professors is considering the
formation of a collective bargain-
ing agency at Bucknell. Michael
Santulli, Asst. Professor of Phil-
osophy, is tentatively organizing a
referendum to poll faculty attitudes
with respect to such an agency.
A recently enacted Pennsylvania
law provides for collective bargain-
ing at institutions of higher educa-
tion; however, this law may be pre-
empted by the National Labor Re-
lations Board in the case of private
schools.

John Peeler, President of the
local chapter of the AAUP, outlined
some of the policies of the national
AAUP concerning collective bar-
gaining. It does not support a
‘union shop’ (i.e., mandatory mem-
bership and compulsive strikes) or
striking for purely economic issues.

This system of collective bargain-
ing has been initiated at various
institutions such as Rutgers and St.
John’s University. It has been peti-
tioned for by the State University of
New York, Adelphi and New York
University.

It is hoped that the forthcoming
referendum will provide a basis for
the possibility of forming a collec-
tive bargaining agency for profes-
sors under the supervision of the
AAUP.

A second topic of discussion was
the method of teacher evaluation.
Presently, the administration is re-
sponsible for this task and the sub-
sequent presentation of teaching
awards, such as the Lindbach
Awards. Among the ideas discussed

for possible improvements were stu-
dent evaluation, departmental eval-
uation and college evaluation. From
these suggestions, perhaps a better
method of teacher evaluation may

Presently, the committee mem-
bers have narrowed their choice to
about eight nominees, though they
are still reviewing those nomina-
tions currently coming in. Dr. Smith
added, however, that he was not at
liberty to release any information
concerning the candidates (names,
professions, background) due to
what would be considered “an in-
vasion of privacy.”

Hopefully, by April the committee
will submit its final recommenda-
tions to President Watts and the
Board of Trustees. Said Dr. Smith,
“We fully expect to have a Dean of
Engineering in the fall.”

Headed by Dr. Wendell Smith,
Provost, the advisory committee
consists of Dr. Ralph Walker, Pro-
fessor of Electrical Engineering;
Dr. Robert Slonaker, Professor of

CA ‘Contact’ Series
To Discuss Education

During the three-week period
from March 1 until March 19, the
C.A. will sponsor a series of fire-
sides and ‘“‘Contact’’ lecture-discus-
sions focusing on various aspects of
education. Dr. William Moore, pro-
fessor of education will begin the
series on Tuesday, at 12:30 in New
Dorm Pit with a “Contact’’ pro-
gram about the survival of the
private university, considering the
nature of the education offered by
private institutions.

“Professors and Students - What
Is Teaching?” will be the topic for
a fireside at the home of Dr.
Richard Ellis, assistant professor
of biology, on the following evening,
at 7:30.

On Monday, March 8, at 7:30 Dr.
John Anderson, associate professor
of economics and other professors
from the department will lead a
discussion in New Dorm Pit on
“Crisis in Education,” in which
they will share some of the ideas
which have been raised in depart-
mental discussions of effective
teaching.

At another ‘‘Contact’’ program on
Tuesday, March 9, Dr. Wendell
Smith, Provost, will comment on
Dr. Moore’s talk of the previous
week and will present his views on

, the topic.

A fireside at the home of Mr.
John Zeller, vice president for busi-
ness and finance, will again focus
on the question of the survival of
the private college, this time in
view of financial as well as educa-
tional value considerations.

An overnight at Cowan on March
13 and March 14, with guest Willi
Unsoeld, a professor at Evergreen
State University in Olympia, Wash-
ington, will deal with alternatives
in education, innovations which are
being tried at other universities.

During the last week Thomas
Risch, dean of men will host a fire-

side on “Education Outside of the
Classroom.”

In the final ‘‘Contact’’ program of
the series on Tuesday, March 16,
Leon Pacala, dean of the college of

arts and sciences will consider al-.,

ternatives for the orientation of both
students and faculty at a university.

Programs held on campus are
open to anyone interested. Firesides
and the Cowan overnight will be on
a signup basis.

Class “72 Initiates
Diploma Revision

Talks between University officials
and the officers of the class of 1972
during the past few months indicate
the likelihood of a revision in the
traditional diploma, to begin with
the graduating class this year.

The revision will provide for the
recognition of students receiving
degrees with distinction, in that
“cum laude,” “magna cum laude,”
or ‘summa cum laude’’ will appear
on the diplomas of those students
who qualify.

The change was proposed to Leon

Pacala, dean of the college of arts 4

and sciences, early this fall by Jack
Hart, Mike Scheinberg, and Ellen
MeVeigh, junior class officers, and
it was later recommended to Wen-
dell Smith, University provost, by
the dean.

Florence Pyle, University regis-
trar, is now in the process of con-
tacting several suppliers in order to
find the most efficient manner in
which to include the distinctions.

“There will be very little trouble
in making the change,” stated Mike
Scheinberg, junior class vice presi-
dent. ‘In fact, most people don’t
even realize that the distinctions
aren’t included on the diplomas

ABS Candidates Air

Editor’s note: The following is an
edited text of a BUCKNELLIAN in-
terview with the candidates for the
ABS offices of president, vice-presi-
dent, and treasurer. John Sprout,
one of the candidates for treasurer,
was unable to attend.

President
(on politics)

Bob Nachshin: If the University
remains apolitical, it is evading its
responsibility as a university. I
think the University has a right to
speak out, particularly against
things which I think are moral in-
justices . . . The universities can-
not remain oblivious to things that
are happening in the country.

Jim Lackritz: When the Univers-
ity takes a stand on an issue, it has
a tendency to speak for all of the
students. I think that it should be
up to the individuals within the Uni-
versity. I don’t think it is right for

the University to speak for every-
body.
(on University government)

Nachshin: I can’t think that stu-
dent government can exist anymore.
It is an anachronism. The only way
that we as students can become
equal partners in the University is
if the ABS is abolished and if we
have some form of a governing unit
where the students have an equal
say in the policies of the University.

Lackritz: I am not for the abolish-
ment of ABS. One of the first things
I would do in office would be to
look at the basic structure of the
ABS and find the best way to create
a system which would be better for
the students and faculty.

(drugs)

Lackritz: As long as drugs are
illegal in the US., then any drug
use by a University student is a
reflection on the University as a
whole . . . I know it is very dif-
ficult to preserve an image when

A Plea for Justice

Editor’s Note: The following is a statement issued by the Harrisburg
Six on February 8, 1971. Two of the defendants, Reverends Joseph Wen-
deroth and Neil McLaughlin, will speak in Vaughan Literature Auditorium
on Sunday night, after the Black Arts Festival has been concluded.

We are thirteen men and women who state with clear conscience that
we are neither conspirators nor bombers nor kidnappers. In principle and
in fact we have rejected all acts such as those of which we have been

accused. We are a diverse group,

position to the massive violence 0:

united by a common goal: Our op-
f our government in its war against

Southeast Asia. It is because of this opposition that we have been branded

a conspiracy.

Our anguish for the victims of the brutal war has led all of us to non-
violent resistance, some of us to the destruction of draft records. But,

unlike our accuser, the Government of The United States, we have not

advocated or engaged in violence against human beings. Unlike the

Government, we have never lied to

our fellow citizens about our actions.

Unlike the Government, we have nothing to hide. We ask our fellow citizens

to match our lives, our actions, against the actions of the President, his

advisers, his chiefs of staff, and pose the question: Who has committed

the crimes of violence?

It is, in fact, the Government which has engaged in kidnapping on an

enormous scale: The deportation of m

illions of Vietnamese—and now Cam-

bodians and Laotians—from their ancient homes by force; the abduction
of American young men from their families under the Selective Service
Laws, sending them across state lines and international borders to be
killed or maimed. It is the Government which has not only conspired but
carried out the destruction by explosives of three countries: Vietnam,
Laos, and Cambodia, crippling these defenseless people with napalm and

pellet bombs, destroying their forests

and rice fields. If one is concerned

with crimes against humanity, it is the officials of the U.S. Government

who should be on trial.

Throughout history, citizens of conscience have engaged in discus-

sions as to how to oppose the overwhe!

Iming power of unjust governments.

In such discussions, the problems of violence and non-violence have been
aired, and an infinite variety of strategies and tactics examined, accepted,

or rejected. Such discussion is par

+ of the tradition of free speech in a

democratic society, protected by the first amendment. When your govern-

ment moves against some citizens through wiretapping, secret agents,
and conspiracy laws, to turn this constitutional right into a crime, free
expression is endangered for all Americans.

Our government’s disregard for the constitutional rights of individuals
has marked every stage of the proceedings against us so far: The pre-
indictment accusations by J. Edgar Hoover, the arrests without warrants,

the excessive bail amounting to ransom, the travel restrictions on de-

fendants and an atmosphere of intimidation created by the Grand Jury,
which began historically as a shield to protect the innocent and has be-
come instead a sword to oppress the defenseless. And most recently, we
have seen a deliberate act by the Attorney General to keep the defendants
from meeting together. Does justice really exist for black people, for poor
people, or for those who, like us, oppose the policy of war? Based on what
has happened to us so far, we can only wonder.

We believe in the Holy commandment: Thou shalt not kill—a com-
mandment which our government has violated with impunity a million
times. We urge our fellow citizens to join us in demanding that our gov-
ernment stop the current secret invasion of Laos, end its expansion of the
war in Southeast Asia immediately and bring its troops, planes, guns and
bombs home without delay. We ask our fellow citizens to resist this war
by refusing to fight, refusing to pay taxes, refusing to cooperate in any
way. Finally, we reaffirm our dedication to a world without violence—
that violence which for so long has ravaged so many lands, so many souls.

people are getting caught. There-
fore, I think that some disciplinary
action should be taken as long as
the University wishes to uphold its
good standing and name.
Nachshin: I don’t think that the
University should act as a law en-
forcement agency, nor do I think
that the University should give in-
formation to law enforcing agencies
about particular students. This is
an invasion of the students’ privacy.

Vice-President
(abolishment of ABS)

Russ Pais: I hope that ABS, as
it stands now, will be (abolished).
We need a faculty-student senate in
which faculty power is distributed
more evenly and major student fac-
tions on campus are represented
more objectively. However, should
a strong Senate not come about,
we will need ABS, but a much
stronger, much more effective ABS.

Lou Bucceri: We need ABS to
channel and funnel student opinion.
The proposed faculty-student senate
will be great, even if it is not
adopted in full version However,
ABS should continue as a “coach”
or “back-up body” for the seven
or eight students who would be on
the Senate.

(athletics)

Pais: The intramural sports pro-
gram should be strengthened .. . In
view of the University’s financial
deficit, however, it is a crime that
the intercollegiate athletic budget
is so large. Funding of this program
should be re-evaluated and trimmed
considerably

Bucceri: I do not believe that
intercollegiate sports should be
abolished. Although the budget is
huge and the benefits to the Uni-
versity are questionable, intercol-
legiate sports should reconstruct
priorities, but remain in operation.
Much of the funds used now for
inter-varsity sports should be re-
channelled for intramurals
(minority graups)

Bucceri: I deplore the present
lack of heterogeneity in the student
body; the isolated, artificial atmos-
phere here will cause the downfall
of the University .. . Admissions
officers should minimize athletic re-
cruiting and drop absurd minimum
standard requirements.

Pais: New priorities should be
set, and a bigger budget for the re-
cruitment of minority students and

new staff members, like black pro-
fessors, should be established.
(differences in opponents)

Bucceri: I am more realistic, but
not more conservative, in my deal-
ings. Confrontation policies and ve-
hement assertions of student rights,
however, are not principles of mine.
There is a need to cooperate with
this faculty and administration, yet
not give in to them; this we can,
and must, do.

Pais: We differ in that my op-
ponent will operate within the sys-
tem longer than I will. At a certain
point, after I've tried for something
without results, I’m inclined to
stand up and assert that I won't
take “no” for an answer. I will de-
mand effective change.

Treasurer

(role of treasurer)

Chuck Resnick: He is chairman
of the Appropriations Committee
of the Co-operative Funding Com-
mittee. As treasurer, I will invest-
igate these committees as to their
effectiveness. My main goal as
treasurer will be to devise a work-
able budget, one within the reach
of our resources.

(on campus issues)

Resnick: I feel that the most im-
portant thing that the ABS is pre-
sently concerned with is the Uni-
versity Senate. If the ABS version

Views on Campus Issues in Forum

of the Senate is not compatable with
the conference committee’s version,
I would advocate a student boycott
of the University Senate and all
University governance. This Senate
is very important because Uni-
versity governance would be un-
workable without a good Senate.
However, I am against abolishing
the ABS

Another area which I feel is im-
portant is the question of required
physical education. I am opposed to
required gym. As treasurer, I would
work for the adoption of one of two
proposals. First, that physical ed-
ucation be offered on a voluntary
basis for eight semesters, four of
them for credit (one-fourth credit
each). There would be no segrega-
tion of classes according to graduat-
ing class, for example, seniors
would be with freshmen, and co-ed
classes would be offered. This plan
would allow those students who
wished to participate in a well-
organized program, without impos-
ing it on others. The second pro-
posal would be to make gym re-
quired for one year only, with a
wider range of choices as to sub-
ject matter.

Another thing for which I would
work is that the Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs should investigate as
soon as possible the possibility of
24 hour open dorms.

University Discussion Offers
Radical Viewpoint of Societ

A free University discussion
group, “Radical Views of Society,”
will meet Friday nights at 10:00
p.m. (after Hilltop) in University
Lounge.

According to Steve Becker, one
of the organizers of the course, its
purpose is to give analyses of prob-
lems of society and possible solu-
tions to such problems that are not

uussed in establishment sources.

Each week a different member of
Lewisburg community, after giving
a relatively short introduction, will
Jead the discussion on a particular
topic.

titles of the various topics to

iscussed are somewhat mis-
leading, according to Becker. For
example, “Radical Views of Educa-
tion” implies that there are some
common views about education that
all radicals share.

“T don’t believe that’s true. Al-
though there seems to be some
common understanding of the pro-
blems and of what kind of solu-
tions are possible, there is much
lively debate in radical circles

Draft Resistance Entails

Planning and Dedication

Features Editor’s Note: The follow-
ing letter was released by the re-
cently formed Draft Counseling
Service, to inform draft resisters
of the legal aspects of returning
their draft cards to their local
boards. The letter was specifically
intended for the information of
seven University students who re-
cently performed this means of
protest, yet it may be of interest
to any student involved with the
draft.

Returning a draft card or burn-
ing it for that matter takes a great
deal of commitment and a sharp
change in direction on the part of
the registrant. Because of the re-
cent statements of members of our
community we felt it was necessary
to outline the steps a draft resister
is liable to be put through

A registrant can no longer be
issued an induction order because
he is delinquent (Breen v. U.S.). A
draft resister cannot be given an
induction order merely because he
returned his draft card. His lottery
number must have been reached
before his local board can draft
him. For example, if my lottery
number were 340 and I received
an induction order I would have ex-
cellent grounds for a procedural
error case on the part of the local
board if I could determine that just
one registrant with lottery number
339 and classified I-A had not re-
ceived an induction order.

Warning

Upon receiving the registrant’s
draft card the local board will
either return it to him with a warn-
ing of how severe the penalties for
such action are or place the draft

ur
rather ocessed just as
If and when
r comes up he
an induction order if
he is medically fit. Just returning
the card is not that dangerous, it is
rather the thought and conviction
behind the act that is dangerous.
Just recently, however, Selective
Service of on the West coast
seem to be t g a new line of
judisdiction; egistrants in
Washi rrested for just

returning their draft cards

The one loophole for a raw deal
is the iduction physical. All
draftees are required to have pas-
sed a physical within twelve months
prior to induction. The local board
has the power to at any time order
the registrant to take a pre-induc-

tion physical examination.

In reality, you, the registrant,
are not usually given an order to
report for a pre-induction physical
unless it looks like you are going
to be drafted. You will, however,
receive such an order if your lot-
tery number is coming up; the
board must give you an order. Re-
fusal to report to this examination
is quite illegal. Usually the board
forgets about the pre-induction
physical, thinking that they can ex-
amine the registrant at the time of
induction. While prosecution in this
case is rare, it does happen (Jim
Love who graduated last year was
arrested for refusing to attend his
preinduction physical).

Choices

If you do not attend the pre-in-
duction physical and the board
takes no action or if you decide it
would be best to attend the physical
you have the following choices
when induction rolls around: 1. Do
not attend the induction ceremony
and risk a chance of being arrested
at an awkward moment; 2. Refuse
induction at the induction center
and in most places risk the same
loss of sanity waiting for the FBI
to come knocking at your door; 3.
Be drafted.

If you refuse induction at the in-
duction ceremony, you’re going to
go through a lot of questions with
a federal agent that would probably
be wise not to answer. Lately the
trend in the big cities such as
Chicago, New York, and possibly
Philadelphia in the near future has
been to arrest refusers at the in-
duction nter-on the spot. In light
of this, you are going to refuse
induction at the induction center
it might be wise to have someone
to bail you out or speak for you
if you hope to get out on personal
recognizance. After that comes ar-
raignment and trial.

Trial Location

It is also important to note that
the registrant has a choice of
where his trial is going to take
place. Any man can have his pre-
induction physical and/or his induc-
tion moved to another state or
court district as long as he has an
address in that district. This is an
important point because most law-
yers feel that the merits of the
case are not as important as the
attitude of the judge. A sketchy
summary of the different judicial
attitudes in the country can be ob-
tained from SIS counselors.
Defense of the registrant is hard.

than is necessary, not to be unduly anxious even about nec-

THE BUCKNELLIAN

: |
FEBRUARY 26, 1971 |

Unless the board has committed a
procedural error he has either com-
mitted an act of resistance or he
hasn’t. One defense that draft re-
sisters stand by is an attack of the
system such as ‘conscription is un-
constitutional without a declaration
of war.’ An outline of such a case
can be obtained from one of the
SIS counselors.

If found guilty, prison sentences
range from six months to five
years. An alternative to prison, de-
pending solely upon the attitude of
the judge, is probation with man-
datory work in the national in-
terest. This is more and more the
trend in and around Philadelphia
with those draft resisters who
strike the judge as ‘conscientious.’

A Recent Case

In parting, the story of a Puerto
Rican draft resister may raise
some hopes. The registrant was
convicted of refusal to enter the
Army and was sentenced to jail.
He appealed and the judge, realiz-
ing the hostility on the island to-
ward the draft, changed the sen-
tence to one hour which the resister
had already served. Not satisfied,
the registrant is appealing that de-
cision!

This has been pretty compressed-
a list of great books on the subject
is available in the back room of
the Bison. Feel free to corner one
of us anytime.

Peace.

Focus: Ecology

By KARL BLAKE

Features Editor’s Note: This article
is the first in a series dealing with
ecology at the University. It was
condensed from an article by Curt
Chandler in the January, 1971 issue
of the Bucknell Engineer.

The University’s Physical Plant
has taken some steps towards re-
ducing the damage done to the en-
vironment by the University com-
munity.

One obvious source of pollution on
campus is the pollution of the air
from the power plant smokestack.
Some precautions were taken to
minimize pollution from this source
when the plant was built in 1949.
The stack was made unusually wide
to reduce the velocity of flue gases
and allow particles to drop to the
bottom of the stack, instead of be-
ing carried out with the smoke. The
stack was also made unusually tall,
so that wind currents would carry
smoke away from the campus. An
oversize stoker was used to increase
burning efficiency.

At the same time a third boiler
was added to the plant in 1961, the
plant began using bituminous coal
instead of anthracite coal, because
of the soft coal’s lower sulfur con-
tent. The coal now used has .6 to
1.5 percent sulfur, somwhat below
federal requirements. The use of
natural gas was considered, but
rejected due to the restricted sup-
ply. A vibrating grate type stoker,
the first of its kind in the state, was
installed to provide more complete

services,” in addition, because
counseling services to students con-
sume staff time during the aca-
demic year, “research is limited
to summer and vacation periods.”
Certainly, then, it seems that prime
concerns of a University Counseling
Service, like the so-called ‘“‘follow-
up” and research are relatively ne-
glected because of a lack of quali-
fied personnel.

The four-week waiting list, too,
hampers effectiveness of the Ser-
vice, and is directly related to the
insufficient number of professional
personnel. Wilder admits that
“those who have immediate deep-
rooted. developmental problems are
necessarily “turned away,” and
only those persons who have rela-
tively minor problems eventually
receive assistance. This inference
would seem to strip the Counseling
Service of its most significant role.
(It must be added that priority
does exist in emergency cases;
however, an “emergency” depends
upon the “‘secretary’s assessment”’
of the situation.)

The long waiting list and the need
for the Counseling Service to offer
other types of assistance such as
group work and consultation with
resident assistants (which is limit-
ed now) have been subjects of in-
dividual and organizational concern
for some time. Letters from AWS

headed by Pete Holmes and Jeff
Sengstack, attest to the displeasure
felt because of an understaffed and,
therefore, seemingly inadequate
Counseling Service.

This lack of personnel (or full-
time Ph.D.’s) in the Service at this
University is evidently due to the
lack of money; indeed, Wilder un-
derstands that ‘“‘budgetry limita-
tions’ are the reason for his limit-
ed operation. Yet, Wilder’s ‘‘needs
have been known for four to five
years.” (Wilder reports directly to
John Dunlop, dean of student af-
fairs who, in turn, reports to the
Provost and the President).

This whole matter reduces to the
question whether an understaffed
Counseling Service is better than
none at all, If only those individuals
with relatively peripheral problems
eventually receive assistance, and
if “follow-up” is virtually nonex-
istent, can the presence of a
Counseling Service be justified?

Dr. Wilder remarks that “there
are serious questions about whether
a Counseling Service should con-
tinue to exist if it is seriously under-
staffed. Students’ attitudes are af-
fected concretely.

Long waiting lists interfere with
satisfactory resolution of students’
problems while, at the same time,
creating dissatisfaction.”

Furthermore, according to one
Counseling Service director at an-
other school, ‘‘a basic minimum in
Counseling Service staffing is
necessary to realize any substantial
effect. Below the minimum level, a
Counseling Service is really not
capable of demonstrating its capa-
bilities.”

Yet, as Wilder points out, “with-
out a Counseling Service, there
might be more emotional problems,
and a less wholesome channeling
of students’ energies, but there
would be no direct feeling of dis-
satisfaction.” Perhaps only a satis-
factory elimination of the under-
staffing problem can resolve this
University’s Counseling Service
troubles and, consequently, relieve
the seemingly mounting student
frustration with the service.

combustion of the coal, and at a
lower temprature.

The University apparently feels
that the installation of devices
which would drastically reduce the
emission of particulate would be
prohibitively expensive.

Another problem is the disposal
of solid wastes. Most of these
wastes are disposed of through in-
cineration. The ‘federally approv-
ed” incinerators in the newest
dorms, Swartz and New Dorm, in-
sure that all combustion takes place
within the combustion chamber and
not in the chimney. Some of the
efficiency of these units is lost, how-
ever, because students put into the
garbage many unsuitable materials,
such as glass and organic wastes.
Some sorting of the garbage is done
before incineration, but the only
economical means of achieving
complete separation would be with
student cooperation.

Outdoor burning has been elimin-
ated.

No incinerator will be installed in
the new University Center. All rub-
bish from the Center will be dis-
posed of in the Lewisburg landfill.

Alternatives to the present meth-
od of solid waste disposal include
recycling, installation of a central
incinerator, remodeling of present
incinerators in the older buildings,
and disposing of all trash in the
Lewisburg landfill.

Recycling is regarded as too ex-
pensive. It would cost at least
$15,000 a year.

To dispose of the trash in the
landfill the University could either
work the present packer truck,
which compacts trash, two shifts,
or it could buy a second truck. The
estimated cost of the first option
would be about $19,600 a year; the
second, $17,800; the third, $10,450.

In addition to dealing with pro-
blems of air pollution and solid
waste disposal, the University has
attempted to reduce water pollution.

The Physical Plant uses phos-
phate free, bio-degradable cleaner
in campus buildings. Of the five
cleaning products used by the laun-
dry only one, a bleach used in small
quantities, contains a_ significant
amount of phosphates. A search is
on for a substitute.

A ceramic holding tank below the
Olin Science Building captures
waste water from labs, mixes it,
and allows it to neutralize itself be-
fore it is released into the sewers.
This process, however, is of un-
certain effectiveness.

The garbage disposals used by the
kitchens reduce the solid waste
problem, but also put nutrients, in-
cluding phosphates, into the water.
These are only partially removed
by primary treatment. Lewisburg
does not have secondary treatment
facilities.

DDT and mercury compounds are
no longer used on the campus and
golf course. However, fertilizer con-
taining phosphates is still used, sup-
posedly only in amounts which soil
tests show to be necessary.

All University cars run on low
octane gasoline, and unleaded gas-
oline is used in all but one vehicle.

One must conclude that the Uni-
versity continues to be guilty of pol-
lution, but it is certainly relatively
innocent in comparison with most
other segments of society.

title he won last year as a fresh-
man. For Bob Young is a tremend-
ous athlete with an incredible
amount of desire.

Freshman year Bob did not go
out for soccer, but chose to play
water polo instead. Last fall, he
went out for the soccer team, and
after two weeks had established
himself as a starter at center for-

Coach Reynolds notes “The key

BY BOB WENDELL :
The University American Insti-
tute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)
Student Chapter participated in the
Third Annual AIChE Skifest on
Sunday, February 21 at Big Boulder
Ski Area. This event was sponsored
by the Penn State student chapter
this year. : :
Three members of the University

Kirk Bishop 72 became the Nation-
al AIChE Ski Champion by taking
first place in the Individual Com-
petition. Clair Wheeler ’74 added to
the Bucknell honors by coming im
second, while Ron Mertz ’71 placed
seventh.

By also winning first place in the
Team Competition, the University
AIChE became the National AIChE
Ski Champions for 1971. This trophy
was won by the University of Colo-
rado the past two years. The Uni-
versity Chapter hopes to be able to

defend its title next year.

attitude is the thing that will en-
able him to outdo many others.
Even as a sophomore, he was a
leader on the team.”

In the soccer team’s opening
game against Pitt, Bob scored the
team’s first goal of the season. A
minute later he was writhing on the
ground with a badly torn cartilage.
Although he continued to exercise
the leg, he was effectively out for
the season.

But he didn’t give up. He came to
every practice, and went to away
gomes in the capacity of a manager.

Come November, Bob turned to
the other sport at which he excells,
swimming. Bob worked hard for a
month, and appeared on the way to
a fine season. But the night before
Christmas vacation he badly
wrenched his knee.

On January 13 he entered Divine
Providence Hospital in Williamsport
and had his left cartilage removed.

On January 27 he discarded his
crutches and began walking. Still,
he could not bend his leg. He spent
hours alone in the pool learning
how to do a flip turn with one leg,
and also strengthened the bad leg
with weights.

When second semester began,
Bob rejoined the team, and has
been swimming two workouts a day
since. Gradually the knee unstiffen-
ed and he could do a regular turn.
Last Saturday he swam in his first
meet of the season against Rutgers,

Icers Gain Upset Victory

on MAC’s

and won the backstroke in an amaz-
ing 2:08.5.

Why has he stuck to it, when it
would have been so easy to just
forget swimming this year? “Last
year, when we lost the MAC’s coach
(Russell) said if we wanted to win
it back, we had to have everybody
back. Besides, if you miss a year
of swimming, it’s almost impossible
to come back.”

Bob credits coach Russell with
much of his inspiration which made
him determined to press on. “He
drove me to the hospital for my
operation, and the very next day he
came to visit me. He came in at
seven o'clock three days a week
and Sunday mornings just to watch
me swim.”

Russell, in turn, passes much of
the credit to Bob. ‘‘His comeback
has been one of the most incredible
things I’ve seen in fifteen years of
coaching. He is truly a remarkable
individual.”

His goals? “‘I hope to place in the
100 and 200 backstroke at the
MAC's.” If dedication is a measure
of success, Bob Young will achieve
his goals.

The Bison Ice Hockey Club con-

against the Canadian-sparked A-

Herd In Invitational

By ALAN GROCHAL

Involving the largest number of
trackmen ever sent to an indoor
meet by BU, the Delaware Invita-
tional will be run tonight and Satur-
day.

Twenty to twenty-five Bisons will
attend the two-day meet which in-
cludes an open meet tonight and an
Invitational meet Saturday. Only
two of BU’s trackmen have been
invited to Saturday’s meet thus far,
but Coach Gulden expects more to
qualify during tonight’s meet.

Rich Francel and Bob Smith are
the Herd’s entrants Saturday. Fran-
cel will run the 880 while Smith is
in the triple jump.

Others whom Coach Gulden ex-
pects to qualify are Len Dillinger
in the high jump, Glenn Clayton in
the 60 yard dash, and John Larner
in the 1000 yard or mile runs.

The Delaware Invitational is the
final tune-up before the IC4A East-
ern Championships next weekend.

Team Effort

Bisons’ first goal. The first period
ended with Academy on top 3-1
after they scored no. 3 on @ sizzl-
ing shot from the point.
The Bisons’ confidence grew as
they watched their goalie, George
Lane, repel all shots in the second
period. This was the incentive the
Icers needed. Just, on the ice after
a penalty, Jim Davenport took a
pass from Ellenberger and convert-
ed it into a score. Shortly there-
after, Ellenberger again fooled the
goalie on a high shot which bounced
off his shoulder into the net. Floyd
Wallace, agile Blue defenseman,
rounded out the scoring in the
second with a twenty foot blast,
the assist going to Geoff Walker.
This gave the Bisons a 43 lead after
two. One player commented that
Lane’s performance in the goal that
period was the best he had ever
seen by a Bison goalie in recent
years.
The third period opened with Paul
Jewell taking a pass from Gerry
Stevick and scoring on a long shot
to the goaltender’s left. ANC then
began to spurt as they scored
quickly and cut the Bison’s lead to
5-4, Then, with only 342 minutes re-
maining, they tied the game at ‘5’.
But the power combination of Hunt
Worth and Gerry Stevick put the
Blue ahead to stay with just two
minutes remaining, on a well-placed
shot by Stevick. An empty net goal
by Davenport, scored after ANC
pulled their goalie for a sixth for-
ward in a last-ditch effort to gain
a tie, finished the scoring.

VOLUME LXXIII — NO. 33 TUESDAY, MARCH 2, 1971

By MARK KNODERER

Alright! The fun and games are
over. It’s time to get down to work.
Such is the attitude of the swimm-
ing team as they head down the
home stretch of the 1970-71 season,
and seek to reclaim the MAC title
they lost last year.

This week the team has begun to
‘taper’ for the championships. For
four months they have been averag-
ing about 5,000 yards a day; the dis-
tance men perhaps about 7,000. The
swimmers, bodies cannot complete-
ly recover from day to day, and, as
a result, performances during the
season are not overly outstanding.

Now the workouts are becoming
shorter, with emphasis on “quality”
rather than “quantity.” The body
recovers completely, and is burst-

ng full of energy from all the pre-
vious conditioning. Such a “taper”
generally takes about ten days, and
can be done effectively only once
a season

Dick Russell’s time table has the

Blue Hens

team’s superior effort planned for
next Thursday, Friday, and Satur-
day.

Tomorrow, however, the prime
contender for that championship,
the Engineers of Lehigh, come into
town for a dual meet. Lehigh has
a multitude of stars returning from
last year’s champions, and are sure
to battle the Bisons for every point.

in the freestyle events, the En-
gineers feature sprinter Phil Hogan,
middle-distance man Alan McGra-
gor, and distance man Bob Sine.
Hogan won the 50 last year, took
second (to O’Keeffe) in the 100, and
won the 100 butterfly. MacGregor
took second (to O'Keeffe) in the 200
fourth in the 500, and fourth in the
100 fly. Sine placed fourth in the
200, third in the 500, and third in
the 1650. He is a 2:07 backstroker
as well.

Loughlin has posted the best time
in the league (2.22.7). and is a good

begin when one player teed up a tennis ball and stroked it over a net into
his opponent’s court.

The player who had received the serve has the option of hitting the
ball back while it is in the air or after it bounces once. This pattern con-
tinues until one player hits the ball into the sand traps or water hazard
surrounding the court.

If this happens the ball is teed up and play begins again. Each player

Another new game reportedly being developed will combine baseball

University faculty, two of the co-de-
fendants and one of the alleged co-
conspirators in the Harrisburg Six
case spoke to a capactiy audience
in Vaughan Literature Auditorium.

Sponsored by the Bucknell Stu-
dents for Peace, the panel discus-
sion included the Reverends Joseph
Wenderoth and Neil McLaughlin,
the co-defendants; Tom Davidon,
one of the co-conspirators; Gene
Chenoweth, professor of political
science; Philip Withim, assistant
professor of English; and Mrs. Zoia
Horn, reference librarian.

Professor Chenoweth made open-
ing remarks. He briefly described
*the series of events of the case thus
far,beginning late last November
when J. Edgar Hoover first charged
conspiracy by the Berrigan brothers
in front of a Senate subcommittee,
until early January, when two Uni-
versity students and two librarians,
including Mrs. Zoia Horn, were
given subpoenas to appear before a
Grand Jury.

Reverend Wenderoth then spoke
about ‘‘wisdom, compassion and
orderliness’ in America today. As
a counter example of wisdom, he
cited the recent false alert of the

National Emergency Warning Cen-
ter, saying, ‘‘We are all pre-pro-
grammed to some degree in this
country, and we must start think-
ing about it.’’

On his view of ‘compassion,’
Wenderoth mentioned ‘“‘political
partisanship’ in light of President
Nixon’s new health program. He
also mentioned that a certain Balti-
more ghetto was not officially clas-
sified as in a state of ‘“malnutri-
tion,’ but that 60% to 80% of its
residents were suffering from some
form of undernourishment.

Discussing ‘orderliness,’ Wende-
roth told about a Laotian tribe
which “became a warring force’
due to American intervention in that
country.

“T feel very strongly about the
probability of justice and morality
in our country today,” he said. “A
lot of what we face is results. We
must look at the causes.”

McLaughlin followed with a com-
parison of the Harrisburg Six in-
dictment to the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin
resolution, which he said effected
“six and a half years of warfare
based on a lie.”

He said that the credibility of the
non-violent peace movement was
“at stake” in the case, and that the
“so-called credibility gap is already
large . . . that we can now say that
a majority of Americans don’t be-
lieve the government.’ He also
said that the case “‘is a test as to
who is telling the truth.”

“It is clear that the anti-war
movement in this country is frac-
tured,’’ McLaughlin continued. “The
government has been able to instill

‘Negro’ Is White Creation

Artists Reflect Black Life

By G. PETER BALAKIAN

¥ “Truly you must know now that
‘Negro’ means something not bio-
logical, but something social that
was created by white Americans,”
asserted Saunders Redding during
the keynote address of the Black
Symposium Weekend Sunday night.

Redding, professor of English lit-
erature at Cornell University,
author of several books, and recipi-
ent of awards as a scholar and
creative writer, added that Negro
America has had to make do with
being a slave. They had to hope for
emancipation, suffer through the in-
justices of the reconstruction period,
and watch the immigrants surpass
them in a few short decades.

Black literature, therefore, is only
understood in a socio-historic con-
text. Saunders explained that the
black people were greatly restricted
in their activities until the late nine-
teenth and early twentieth centur-
ies because slavery was written
into the Constitution, and the black
man was considered only three-

fifths of a man

Therefore, being constantly chain-
ed to the land, the Negro in Ameri-
ca had little time or opportunity
for mental expansion. However,
there were a few early black lit-
erary artists, but they failed to ex-
press the true feelings of the black
American and were not honest in
portraying the vicious treatment
they received from the whites.

Redding explained that the most
expressive forms of Negro creation
during the nineteenth century were
Negro spirituals and folklore. “‘They
expressed the pathos and the humor
of the black man,” said Redding.
Spirituals like ‘Let My People Go”
and “Sometimes I Feel Like A
Motherless Child’’ revealed the true
tragedy of the Negro in America.
“The Ballad Of John Henry’ por-
trayed the inhumanity of the Ameri-
ean technological society.

“With the advent of Booker T.
Washington,’ Redding explained,
“the black American was set back.

“Ballet Troupe Merits Accolade
For Overwhelming Performance

By MILTON SLEETER

In eight years the Pennsylvania
Ballet has estiblished itself as one
of America’s better dance com-
panies. As witnessed last night, they
have the ability to perform the
masterpieces of the past, as well
as those of the present, and per-
form them well.

Michael Fokine’s ballet Les Sylp-
hides is a “romantic revery” - a
series of choreographic pictures for
the corps de ballet, plus four solo-
ists. The lovely music for the ballet
is composed of seven piano pieces
of Chopin, orchestrated by Roy
Douglas. The beautiful Nocturne
was exquisitely danced with grace
of line and body movement.

Unfortunately, the orchestra had
its problems throughout the even-
ing - poor intonation, wrong notes,
and poor balance were much too
prevalent. However, Kathryn Biever
and Gretchen Warren also had
trouble convincing one that dancers
and orchestra were together in their
solos. Alba Caldraza and David

. | eee

Kloss both danced superbly with
such apparent ease.

The music of Carl Orff is noted
for its rhythmic vitality - his use of
repeated rhythmic patterns and
large percussion forces. Orff con-
sidered himself as a melodist. His
scenic cantata, Carmina Burana,
written in 1936, is based on twenty-
five poems and student songs from
a 12th century Latin manuscript
found in the Benedictbeuren Monos-
tery of Germany.

Orff has divided these rather
bawdy songs into a three-part cycle
dealing with man’s encounter with
niture, wine, and love. The variety
of musical material used by Orff
ranges from the melismatic plain
chant like melody, to the robust
drinking song, to the beautiful
areoso.

By itself, Orff's Carmina is an
impressive work - coupled with
John Butler’s choreography, it be-
comes overwhelming. It is easy to
see why this ballet has won inter-
national acclaim - its sensuous

quality combined with tense physi-
eal frenzy attacks the senses.

Carmina may not be everyone’s
ballet - it may be offensive to some
- how I don’t know. One would have
to fight pretty hard not to get
caught up in its excitement. The
ballet never lets up - never lets you
regroup; from the first resounding
chord, there is a continual drive
forward, slowing down occasionally
only to come back again.

The dancing last night was
superb. There was little doubt that
the dancers were in complete con-
trol. From their first encounter,
through the “‘contest’’ dances, to
the return of the bitten-lovers,
Misses Sandonato and Fuerstner
were expertly partnered by Mssrs.
Parkes and Rodham. Both men per-
formed their athletic movements
admirably, but Rodham’s perform-
ance as the drunken abbot was the
highlight of the ballet.

that of Rudy Menchaca. Menchaca

The election results were witheld
until midnight because there had
been a misunderstanding of one of
the campaign rules. It has been
rumored that Jim Lackritz, a presi-
dential candidate, was protesting
the election and questioning the
validity of some of the campaign
tactics of his opponent. As no pro-
test was officially filed, it is as-
sumed that the difficulty was in
some way resolved.

Residence Hall Offices
Change Staff Eligibility

By PAMELA MAY

“Being a J.C., or an R.A., is not
something you can put into twenty-
five words or less. It involves a lot
of work, a lot of unexpected things
—good and bad. It can be interest-
ing, exciting. A tremendous experi-
ence.”

These are the reflections of Shel-
ley Colio, who has served both as a
J.C. and an R.A. Any who have
held either position will verify it’s
a rewarding experience.

Interested persons may now apply
for either or both positions by pick-
ing up and submitting by Wednes-
day, March 10, 4:30 p.m., a form
for J.C. from the Office of Fresh-
man Residence Programs or R.A.
from the Office of University Resi-
dence Halls.

A change in eligibility of women
has been made for this year—all
women who will be of junior or
senior class standing, or 21 years of
age, are eligible for either position.
This change was made to match the
men’s traditional qualifications.

Any person may apply for both
positions, although it is expected
that he or she may indicate a pre-
ference in the course of the applica-
tion and interview period. Appli-
cants will be notified of the final
selections by April . 9

Speaking about this change in
qualifications for female J.C.s, Miss
Brenda Gordon, director of fresh-
man residence programs, acknow-
ledged that ‘“‘some seniors may find
the freshman attitude foreign.”
However, she emphasized this may
not be so in the case of all seniors:
“We are more interested in the
person than his class standing.”

“Basically,’’ explained Miss Gor-
don, ‘‘we’re looking for people who
are understanding, accepting, sensi-
tive, and responsive to others. They
must be together enough to know
where they’re at, to handle any-
thing that comes their way. This

doesn’t mean the stopped grow-

ing or searching. ‘re not looking
for thirty-eight ‘finished people’.”

She further elucidated that J.C.s
would be more involved in the fall
freshman orientation than past
years by leading discussions, ete.
However, “the program is not final-
ized.”

Miss Judy clarified, ““‘We want
people who are concerned about
people. We don’t want machines—
they could lock up the dorms for us.
Instead we want some one who will
assume a counseling point of view,
who will assume neither the ex-
tremetreme of interfering, nor the
opposite of not wanting to ‘get in-
volved’.””

Mr. Len Smolen, assistant di-
rector of University residence halls,
noted the major difference between
serving as an R.A. versus J.C. is
that ‘freshmen go more readily to
their J.C., and, therefore, a J.C.
may find more fulfillment. The R.A.
may often have to work with stu-
dents who reject him, for they often
regard him as aligning with the
‘establishment’.’”

“The R.A. is there to help the
student on a counseling basis, not
a punitive level—to offer assistance
and not to search and report. Many
students are still suspicious, and it
may take a while to gain the con-
fidence we're seeking.”

“Counseling is the basic approach
of the orientation staff here,”’ con-
tinued Mr. Smolen. “The R.A. acts
in the same capacity, only on a
much lower level; he, because he
is working with peers, may be
closer to the student on a personal
level.”

After the applications for J.C. and
R.A. have been filled out, group
discussions will be arranged to
“allow the applicants to ask ques-
tions of the people directly in-
volved,”’ an innovation in the selec-

FEEDBACK

During the past week, the Concert
Committee has received sharp criticism
for its handling of the Chicago concert
of February 19. Much of the criticism
has been directed at the Committee’s
chairman, Andy Meyer. It is unfortunate,
yet not unexpected, that serious ques-
tions are being raised about the Com-
mittee’s handling of the concert series.

For four years, the Concert Com-
mittee has been Andy Meyer. Meyer’s
work has so overshadowed the other
members of the Committee that students
have been lead to believe that there
really are no other members. The general
level of knowledge about the Committee
has consisted in knowing the name of its
head and the names of the groups he,
presumably single-handedly, has brought
to campus. The behind-the-scenes activi-
ties of the Committee have remained
unknown.

There are few students who fully
understand the intricacies of getting
“big-time” groups to “small-time” BU.
Among these students (principally
others on the committee and close friends
of Meyer) there is overall confidence in
and praise for his work. They contend
that he has provided the “inside” know-
ledge in dealing with the agents of
groups who would not normally consider
appearing at such a small school. Above
all, these students attest to Meyer’s
honesty and desire to get the best for
the campus.

Yet the student body is filled with
feelings of distrust and disillusionment
concerning the Committee. The protest,
however, is general and abstract and is
not directed at specific faults of the
Committee. The basis for the criticism
is a sense of powerlessness — frustra-
tion over being only the passive sup-
pliers of the Committee’s funds. Thus,
the criticisms are of the Committee’s
style, not its content.

Se ee a

The Committee has been a closed
group which has dealt with the student
body in only a most indirect manner. It
has made some token gestures towards
opening itself up, but has been unsuc-
cessful in its attempts to “appease” stu-
dent fears over misdealings. Although
most of the fears are probably ground-
less, they remain. The Committee must
confront these fears.

Committee members will contend
that this may be impossible to do. They
might argue this way, We are too small
a school to openly deal with large groups.
Unless we are allowed to make arrange-
ments with them in our own way, we will
end up with a second class concert
series.” Within limits, this analysis is
correct, but it cannot give the Concert
Committee a blank check to deal with
students as they wish. The Committee
uses the students’ money.

If indeed the nature of our campus
and the nature of the concert business
make it difficult for the Committee to
be truly open in its dealings, then we
should be sure that the Committee is
being as open as it can be. The Com-
mittee must open itself to continued
student criticism and analysis, and rep-
resentative students, not directly as-
sociated with the Committee, should
have complete access to the records of
the Committee’s work. Communications
can also be improved upon. When a
group is booked, the fact should be an-
nounced, and not held until the package
deal is ready to be placed on the market
for sale. Forms may be helpful. But until
the Committee can open itself complete-
ly there will continue to be apprehen-
sions and groundless charges. That may
have to be expected. It is unfortunate,
however, that Meyer has had to take
the brunt of the attack. Perhaps the cri-
ticism should rather have been directed
at the industry he is dealing with.

Letters to the Editor

Dear Bucknell Students

Once again, it is incumbent upon
me to run for office. The situation
which I have warned against in my
last three campaigns for President
of the Freshman Class (among my
other attempts) has come to pass
Bucknell is in danger of losing it-
self entirely in a morass of molas-
ses. I am the only solution to this
problem.

Although I am sure you all know
every detail of my fascinating and
adventurous life (my semi-autobio-
graphical novel, Death in the Morn-
ing Sun has been serialized on most
of the reputable matchbook covers),
perhaps I should say an additional
word about myself. I am a Junior
who lives a retiring life in the dug-
out behind the hometeam stands,
appearing in public only for elec-
tions and on ground hog day. I was
also one of the first people to wear
a V-neck sweater.

I’m running on a ticket that in-
cludes an Avacado for vice-presi-
dent. The Avacado isn’t just any old
avacado: She’s a Negro Avocado.
So you see, I am a liberal.

Now to the issues. I’m for repeat-
ing change until we get used to it.
Change is like a machine gun: it
fires in rapid bursts, but you need
the ammunition. Don’t bull it; bul-
let!

Bucknell is in a crisis of mean-
ing. The crisis is of scissors, which
is harder to fathom than to pro-
nounce. Like a scissors, we must
cut the paper neatly, giving them a
clean edge and a place to go. I am
of course speaking metaphorically.

Some negative thinkers say that

Bucknell has no meaning, no reason
to exist. I say that Bucknell’s raison
d'etre is a raisinet.

During my last campaign for
Frosh President I suggested in the
Bucknellian that we create a new
form of University Governance
based on the number three, on the
grounds that there are four legs
to a table and Bucknell is not a
table, is it?

But times have changed and the

times must change with them. Now
I propose that students demand the
right to be totally unrepresented
in the University Senate. Let the
professors have their independence.
Then we can form a student govern-
ment. We could set up a system in
which all living units would elect
representatives who would listen to
public discussions weekly, and then
weakly vote on the important mat-
ters.
“The first job of the student and
faculty groups would be to appoint
a joint committee to study the im-
portant problem of University Gov-
ernance. This would require honest,
open discussions of what a raisinet
is, over a leisurely lunch with sea-
food substitutions if it is held on a
Friday (we must learn to be more
tolerant), and something real good
for desert. After all, the people in-
volved deserve something special
for their efforts!

Open Discussions Now: If you’re
not Forum, you're against *em!!

The Avocado promises to fight for
minority rights. She already has
earned the thanks of the Italian
Anti-Defamation League for her
valiant struggle to free the oppres-
sed zuccini.

Smoking
To the Editor:

Numerous complaints have been
received about smoking in class-
rooms and auditoriums. There are
three basic reasons why smoking
must be prohibited except in author-
ized areas which are appropriately
marked and provided with ash
trays:

1. It is discourteous to non-

smokers to pollute the air and
impose your habit on others.
State law makes it illegal to
smoke in theaters or auditor-
iums. This applies particularly
to the University Theatre and
to the Vaughan Literature
Auditorium where much of the
complaint against smoking has
originated.
The cost of cleaning and of re-
pairing damage to upholstery
and rugs can become exces-
sive.

The cooperation of all members
of the University community in ob-
serving good manners in the ob-
servance of smoking regulations
will be appreciated.

Editorial

To the Editor:

I read with concern the editorial
in The Bucknellian of Feb. 23 ad-
vocating the adoption of a con-
tinucous progress-pass system at
Bucknell. I would like to take this
opportunity to offer my observa-
tions on this issue.

The proposal for a continuous
progress-pass system can be seen
in the light of a recent trend to-
wards an even more loosely de-
fined education at Bucknell. Thus,
a year ago we reduced the distri-
bution requirements in the liberal
arts curriculum to two natural
science, two social science, and four
humanities courses. Now it is pro-
posed that the student be allowed
a virtually indefinite period to com-
plete his course-work and that he
not be graded on his efforts. It is
said that this move would reduce
the pressure on students and theus
facilitate learning. The editorial I
the pressure on students and thus
today students must fail their
courses because they cannot keep
up.

I will not discuss the assumptions
about learning made by this edi-
torial, except to remark that it is
not at all clear that students learn
better when pressure is reduced. I
am concerned here with the wider
effects such a non-competitive, zero-
pressure environment. We hear
every day of strife and conflict in
“the outer world'’—in business, poli-
tics, war. Yet it is urged that as a
preparation for this world we culmi-
nate the educational process with
four years of leisurely dilettant-
ism. What sort of preparation is
this? Graduates will have to face
competition in getting a job, in
keeping it and advancing, in getting
his political views adopted, ete_—he
will constantly be under time pres-
sure and constantly evaluated.
Should he not be prepared for this,
able to cope with it?

Ah, but it is also said that the
system is bad, that such pressure
is dehumanizing and should be
eliminated so that people can pro-
ceed at their own rates . . . Except
that we must have freedom NOW,
an end to poverty NOW, peace
NOW, clean air NOW—and never
mind the complaints of overworked,
criticized (i.e., graded) businessmen
and officials who must accomplish
these things.

Thus we point up the urgency of
our national problems without call-
ing for an educational system that

will prepare to deal with them. The
student is to be leisurely in his
habits—until graduation, when he
must overnight become efficient and
effective.

What of the content of the train-
ing our future leaders are receiv-
ing? It is said that technology is
our greatest domestic problem—bet
can the Bucknell graduate under-
stand and thus cope with tech-
nology? Of course he can—after all,
he’s had Physics 201-202! It is said
that we must take account of the
human factor and of social costs
and benefits in our calculations.
And our graduate can handle that—
he’s had two social science courses.
Ah, but the really important thing
is sensitivity to people—and four
humanities courses certainly pro-
vide that. Well, they may provide a
fluency in expression, but the writer
is in danger of having nothing to
say.

In short I am urging that the
problems we face today cannot be
solved without the most disciplined
application of knowledge we are
capable of. But the University is
not moving in this direction, for all
its talk of social concern and re-
sponsibility.

As a result, when our students
graduate, they may have a burning
sense of social injustice but no idea
at all of what to do about it. They
protest, they “‘bear witness,” they
burn or kill, and eventually they
drop out and turn on to drugs in
frustration, their pride destroyed by
the realization of their own incom-
petence. Can society or the indi-
vidual or the University long afford
or tolerate this?

To sum up briefly, we cannot
even begin to solve our problems
without disciplined, knowledgeable
people to attack them. What is the
message for this University? Per-
haps thirty-two required courses,
with no (pass-fail) and no con-
tinuous progress. Those who do not
wish to undergo this discipline may
stargaze at their leisure—they need
not spend $16,000 for the privilege.

In short, if the University con-
tinues to proclaim nothing but al¥
solute and total educational an-
archy, then it, the student, and our
society will suffer beyond belief.
Let those who agree with this an-
alysis not allow a vocal minority
to push through such ill-conceived
proposals. Let us speak out.

Sincerely,
William J. Mates, ’71

About YourSelf

By DAVID HAMMER

Identity crises have been the subject of much thought recently—more
people than not want to know who they are and what they are all about.
And although one may suggest countless ways of discovering one’s “true
Nature,” I would argue for the simplest and most direct method of all:
feeling what you do.

Many individuals, after much ‘‘soul-searching’’ and inwardly-directed
inquiry, eventually arrive at a self-appraisal which seems generally ac-
curate but which is specifically superficial. Nevertheless, armed with this
self-perception, they live segments of their lives supposedly “doing what
they feel.”

For example, if someone after much thought that he harbors a deep-
rooted depression, he may wish to hide his emotions from others and will,
consequently, ‘“‘put on an act” and appear happy, well-adjusted and con-
tent. He would, therefore, be ‘doing what he thinks he should feel.”

But this line of action suggests that persons can always act or dis-
guise the way they feel no matter whom they are with; and, ‘‘doing what
you feel’ assumes that one is constantly self-appraising and analyzing
himself, continuously developing an accurate perception and conciously
performing as a direct result of his apprasial.

My contention that one should “feel what he does’’ presupposes none
of these assumptions. In an example of the emotional depression, I would
maintain that, if a person appears well-adjusted and content believing
he is deeply depressed, that individual is not so sad as he supposed. In-
deed it is my argument that one’s self is, in reality, as it appears to be
via his outward actions and reactions with others.

This reasoning reveals an appreciable means of understanding one’s
self—and it seems unquestionable. How can one deny that he is being
himself when he makes a particular remark or that he is positively
reflecting his being when ke reacts with those around him? It seems
difficult to speculate that what we appear to be is actually the result of
extended performances for the sake of others; rather, it is much more
sensible to realize that how we appear in this largely-spontaneous world
is as largely-spontaneous beings. And, so, to suggest that one can con-
sistently cloak his spontaneity—and self—borders on the absurd.

Consequently, if one would like to resolve his identity crisis, he need
only observe himself and his actions to do so: one should constantly
“feel what he does.” Misunderstandings between persons will then
steadily decrease and individuals will no longer primarily rely on false
appearances versus honest feelings because appearances and feelings
will be realized as one and the same thing.

Like the Band, Sea Train synthesizes the roots of rock within the traditional forms of American

music... It draws upon almost every aspect of rock's history .. Their music reflects, much like the Band's,
a finely developed sense of working fogether that produces coherent music. The group brings fresh

hope that rock is neither dead, nor dead-ended.

The co-consiprator, Mr. Davidon,
said that one of the reasons he feels
the government has indicted him “is
to attempt to further the intimida-
tion of other people.” He also men-
tioned the relative lack of response
to the recent Laotian incursion,
saying, “This is some of the in-

timidation which has stifled us.”

Davidson later said that the in-
dictments could hinder or help the
peace movement. “That depends on
you, on everyone in this room,” he
explained.

Comment

By ROBERT WENDEL

In the U.S. we, as citizens, have
the right of ‘‘dissent,” and/or “free
speech.”’ Also as human beings, we
have obligation to try to right
wrongs when we see them. Those of
you who know me personally, or by
name, know that I am not known
for my silence, to put it mildly.

Earlier in the school year I wrote
a column from the editors desk con-
cerning the basketball coach, Don
Smith, and summarily received a
great deal of flack for simply say-
ing things which were not only true
at the time of the articles, appear-
ance, but for at least three years
previous to it

Well, at this time, I find it acso-
lutely necessary that sonmeone
comment on the basketball game
played against Delaware on Feb-
ruary 24, and on the year as a
whole.

Coach Don Smith is not only a
bad coach, but also a ridiculous
one. To point directly at the Dela-
ware game, we see many mistakes
concerning strategy. First, the Hens
had only six players. Any coach
would immediately have seized on
the opportunity to run the opposl-
tion into the court and possibly
fouled out a few of the Hens play-
ers. Not Smith. He played Dela-

Smith doesn’t like it.

However, the fact remains that
the Bucknell basketball team needs
Ramsay. I’m not trying to make
him into an Oscar Robertson, but
I am trying to say that he is one of
the best players this school has, and
it is impossible to rationalize why
he has been sitting on the bench for
the better part of a year.

In conclusion, I must add that I
hope this article doesn’t jeprodize

me if it did.

I would also ask once again that

Knights Slip Past Cagers
As Herd Finishes Season

By ALAN GROCHAL

Closing the cage season on a dis-
appointing note, the Bisons lost a
heartbreaking 60-59 decision to Rut-
gers, Saturday.

The Scarlet Knights’ Tom Roth
converted two free throws with only
two seconds remaining to snatch
victory from the Thundering Herd.

Weekend Sports

In other action over this weekend,
the Bison mermen sent the Lehigh
tankers home with a 64-49 defeat.
The Bisons ended the season with a
9-2 record. The swimmers are now
busy preparing for the MAC champ-
ionships this weekend at Temple.
Further details will be presented in
the next issue of the Bucknellian.

The Bucknell grapplers weren’t
quite so lucky as junior Mark Ram-
age notched a 9-8 victory over his
Syracuse opponent to prevent a
shutout as the Orange routed the
matmen 33-3. The wrestlers will
participate in the MAC tournament
at Gettysburg this weekend.

The intramural bowling tourna-
ment will be held this Thursday and

BU led by as many as 4 points
in the final minute of play but a
turnover and a missed foul shot set
up Rutgers’ comeback.

Trailing until the final 442 min-
utes of play, the Bisons streaked
ahead behind the inspired play of
Chris Riley.

Riley, who played his last game
for BU, led the team with 19 points.
Bill Peterson the only other grad-
uating player added 9 points in his
final effort for the Herd.

Sophomore Jim Donovan played
well down the stretch with seven of
his ten points coming in the last 7
minutes of the game.

Bison fans were given a scare
late in the first half, when center

capes aae

Harvey Carter was forced out of
the game with an injury. Carter was
sorely missed as BU fell behind
33-24. Carter returned shortly be-
fore the half however, and helped
the Herd pull to within 4 at inter-
mission 36-32.

Deserving special note is the fact
that the Bisons were able to stay
with a much taller team. The Scar-
let Knights’ front line consists of
6’9”, and 6’6” players.

BU finished their season with 2
9-14 mark while Rutgers is 14-7.

On an encouraging note, four of
tonight’s starting five will return to
Coach Smith next year, making the
Bisons definite future MAC con-
tenders.

McCloskey Verdict Reversed
Graduate Awards (Court Rules on Room Search Policy

By GINA SMITH

College dormitory rooms are as
secure from unwarranted police
searches as private homes, apart-
ments, and hotel rooms, according
to a recent Superior Court ruling.

The verdict reversed a possession
of marijuana sentence on Roy Wil-
son McCloskey, former student
here. Additionally, the court has
clarified the official procedure for
entering and searching a student’s
room.

In his appeal, McCloskey had
challenged the legality of the search
of his room by state police and
narcotics agents in the spring of
1968. The authorities let themselves
in by use of a pass key obtained
from the head resident of the dormi-
tory

John Zeller, vice-president for ad-
ministration and finance, recalls the
incident: “‘There was some question
as to whether the investigators
knocked on McClaskey’s door. They
didn’t announce the purpose of their
visit, and they wrongly assumed
that McCloskey was not in the
room.”

The McCloskey verdict stands as
the most author e statement on
dormitory searches at this time. All
college officials in the country must
follow these guidelines in entering
a student’s room. However, the Su-
perior Court verdict presently is be-
ing appealed to a higher court.

John Dunlop, dean of student af-
fairs, cites both the McCloskey rul-
ing and guidelines approved by ABS
and faculty last year as determin-
ing official University policy on

Women J. C.’s Oppose Change
Revised Counselor Qualifications Spark Debate

By PAMELA DAY

The change in women’s qualifica-
tions for J.C., now allowing both
juniors and seniors to hold the posi-
tion, has created widespread de-
bate among those involved in or
knowledgable about the situation.
Of those interviewed it appears that
it is mainly the women who oppose
such a change in their system while
the men, whose system of freshman
counseling has traditionally allowed
both juniors and seniors, have much
to say in its favor.

Mary Ellen Cacetta, a past J.C.,
summarized the major reason for
those who do not welcome the
change, “I don’t think it’s good for
a senior to be a freshman counselor.
A senior is really removed from
freshmen. She could make an effort
but there’s just such a difference in
life outlook. I really don’t think all
that many seniors will be interest-
ed: they have their other concerns
taking them away from campus in-
terests, looking for jobs.’’

Also a past J.C., Shelley Colio
thought it ‘‘a shame seniors will be
so close to freshmen. The seniors
are characteristically indifferent be-
cause they’re leaving and can’t get
excited about the University. It’s
a shame to put them in contact with
freshmen, although the freshman
spirit might be contagious.”

Beth Wright, now applying for R.
A., raised a new argument in stat-
ing her belief that, “by the time
you go through junior year, you
need to be with upperclassmen to
challenge your ideas. It’s not that
seniors won’t be interested, but
freshmen are special people. Juniors
are much more close to them and

better able to help.’

She also pointed out that, ‘“‘Fresh-
man women get especially close to
their J.C. A junior would still be
here the next year, while a senior
who left wouldn’t give the same
carrying through action.”

Also a former J.C., now an R.A.,
Jeanne Brockmyer reflected, ‘‘One
of the best things about being a J.C
is the freshness and newness of it.
It’s new to you and new to the
freshman, so you have a spontane-
ity and enthusiasm on both sides.”

She further stated as a_ senior
that ‘‘What you're thinking about
and what the freshman are think-

Black Prof Outlines
Afro Music History

By BILL WHITNEY

“The Influence of the African
Idiom on Music of the United
States’’ was the topic of a lecture
delivered by Howard University
Professor Vada E. Butcher on Sun-
day afternoon in Vaughan Litera-
ture Auditorium as part of the
Afro-American Symposium II.

Professor Butcher's lecture, which
included many taped recordings,
traced the influence of African
music on the music of America
from the time Negro slaves were
first brought to this continent with
their tribal songs to the “downright
revolutionary’’ compositions of pre-
sent Afro-American musicians.

Since the slaves originated from
western Africa, Butcher began her
lecture by describing the character-

ing about is so different. It would
be bad for the freshan to have some-
one in a J.C. position lose interest
in something they’re interested in:
the J.C. is just as important at the
end of the freshman year.”

Current J.C., Pam Schwartz, said
she was ‘‘surprised’’ to hear about
the change in qualifications. She
stressed that ‘“‘The needs of the job
is different for girls from guys:
girls need a J.C. around a lot
more.”

The men, who have traditionally
had both seniors and juniors work-
ing with freshmen, expressed an
opposite view.

Curt Torell, a senior freshman
counselor, had much to say favor-
ing ‘‘a mixture of juniors and
seniors.” “As a group of hall
counselors, they work best together.
Juniors and seniors each have their
separate advantages to give to the
group. They bring up diverse com-
ments, bring out more ideas.”

Another senior counselor of fresh-
man men, Matt Ridgway, stated
straightforwardly, ‘I can’t see a
problem with a senior in that job.
You have to take into account the
person who really wants to do this
job. A senior will know herself well
enough to know how she will react
to the job.’

“Many senior girls think they
can’t handle it. Some one who feels
that way should not try. But there
will be exceptions. Maybe some one
just couldn’t do it their junior year;
it would be too bad if the op-
portunity were closed.”

“Anyone who applies goes through
a lot of soul-searching. He figures

(Continued on Page 4)

ably wouldn’t be informed of them.”

As stated in the ABS rules,
“search of a room by law enforce-
ment officers under the authority
of a duly issued search warrant
must be permitted by the University
whether the occupant is present or
not.””

For a University-based search,
there must be reason to suspect
that a room ‘(1) contains stolen
goods . (2) items or persons pro-
hibited by University regulations

are present; or (3) activities are in
progress that are forbidden by Uni-
versity regulations.”

Dean Dunlop asserts,
tory room is searched,
every effort to ident
and our purpose before entering.
Prior to the McCloskey decision,
knocking and identification were not
required.”

Conference Committee Next

ABS Approves Senate

Regarding completion of the ABS
consideration of the University Sen-
ate, Bob Nachshin, newly elected
student body president, said. “I
think the ABS has gone a step
further than the faculty has to-
ward establishing a true com-
munity governance.’

The Association of Bucknell Stu-
dents finally ratified their amended
version of t Univers Senate
document by a vote of 20 to 5 at
its Wednesday night meeting

The document will now be sent
to a conference committee in the
nevt step of the document’s ratifica-
tion process. This committee will
attempt to iron out the differences
between the faculty and the ABS
versions of the ate

After that, the document will be
sent back to the faculty for their
approval and then to the entire
student body in the form of a ref-
erendum

The faculty passed the Senate
October 19 and immediately after-
wards the ABS began its considera-
tion of the document, October 23. A
total of 63 amendments were sub-
mitted over a five month period.

The most important change the
ABS made was in deleting the stu-
dent life committee because the
Congress felt that its duties over-
lapped with those of the ABS. The
Congress felt therefore that this
committee was not needed

The Congress also discussed the

Dateline: The Campus

By STEVE SHEDD
The Pitt News has reported that the University of Pittsburgh is pre-

sently under racial pressure

“Black and white students on this campus are at the moment violently
uptight and ready to strike out at anyone who is their opposite in color;
and if something isn’t done to alleviate the tension now prevailing we’re
going to have a first-class, busted-head, students-hospitalized-maybe-even

killed, race riot.”’

This tension stems from an incident on February 20 in which a black
student and a white student engaged in what is believed to be name-call-
ing and threatening. Campus police were called to the scene but the tower

of tension had already been built.

What resulted was a good-sized fist-throwing fracas between the black
and white students. Several students were injured in the incident.

Students at Villa Maria College in Erie, Pa. have been wondering
why there is only a token representation of black students on campus
In an article published in the school’s newspaper. The Villecrit, the at-
titude of the administration was blamed.

The reason for the lack of black students were presented: (1) the
absence of black faculty members (2) the absence of black administrators
(3) the absence of a black advisor (whom the students could relate and
identify) (4) hardly any black films shown and finally (5) scarcely any
black speakers or performers of any kind scheduled.

Black Panther, Huey Newton, spoke recently at Syracuse University
His speech carried a theme for the world to work together.

Newton preached intercommunalism and love, not nationalism and
racism. ‘‘Without you there can be no revolution. The people must liberate
their institutions, and when the empire that is America can no longer
control the world, the universal police can no longer oppress the people
there will be but one world, one people. Newton spoke calmly, portraying
his vision of the future, as he asked for the help of all men in pursuing

his goal.

Athletic Objectivity

It is difficult to dispute the conten-
tion that, if students are to be included
on committees whose decisions will af-
fect all students, then these members
should be appointed by the entire stu-
dent body. Since the students at this
University have chosen to be represented
by the ABS, it follows that these mem-
bers of University committees should
necessarily be appointed by the Congress
of the ABS.

A subcommittee of the Committee
on Academic Regulations is presently en-
gaged in evaluating the physical educa-
tion requirement. The membership of the
committee was specified by the Provost,
the chairman of the CAR. Although
four students were allowed to partici-
pate, the ABS was instructed to appoint
only two of the four. The other two
students were appointed by the Men’s
and Women’s Physical Education Depart-
ments.

ing

During the course of the committee
deliberations, the students appointed by
the ABS requested an explanation of
the rationale behind allowing the physi-
cal education department appointee:
participate on the committee. A
factory answer was never found, a:
from the argument that “both
should be represented.”

The appointment of committee mem-
bers should only take into account the
ability of these individuals to arrive at
a rational decision after impartially
evaluating information presented to
them. Although, in reality, such im-
partial and unbiased people are rarely
found, to deliberately appoint certain

ABS Editorial

To the Editor

The Bucknellian editorials of Feb
26 calling for the disbanding of the
ABS were yet another example of
the lengths to which the Editorial
Board will go in order to mislead
the University into accepting its
opinions. It is my intention to...
clarify some of the more blatant
deceptions being perpetrated. I do
this because I w a member of

nature of the problem to which the
editorial refers. As a member of the
ABS Ste: Committee and a
friend of the candidate involved, I
can verify Craig’s letter. The Elec-

al people who considered running
for the office in question. However,

such a spurious syllogism. The prob-
lem at Bucknell isn’t that people
don’t have opinions on certain sub-

the ambition or confidence neces-
sary to take action. A body of in-

We are not disputing the fact that
“both sides should be represented.” But
they should not necessarily be represent-

be represented in the information which
the committee uses to arrive at its con-

choice of its own representatives is an

Sea Train
To the Editor:

Upon returning to campus after
January, I was somewhat disap-
pointed, as I’m sure several stu-
dents were, in learning of the con-
cert series planned for the semester.
I was very hesitant in buying a
ticket and even bothering to see a
group called ‘Sea Train.” Last
weekend, however, I happened to
catch them in concert with the
Youngbloods at Colgate University
When it was all over, the Train had
played for two and a half hours in
one of the most totally involved
concerts I had ever experienced.
The appearance of the Youngbloods
at midnight could only be a letdown.

With an electronic violin ,that in
my opinion, surpasses the quality
of It’s A Beautiful Day, and a flute
that competes with the excellence
of Chicago, this amazing folk-rock
group is definitely worth seeing. I
hope they can turn on the erratic
Bucknell audience with the same
kind of show that completely blew
up the Colgate gym.

Elections
To the Election Committee:

This letter is not intended to be
a personal criticism against any one
individual on the election board, or
against my opponent in the past
election. I congratulate Bob and en-
courage all members of the Buck-
nell community to support him

My letter is written as a criticism
of the procedure used during the
past campaign. As a candidate, I
was notified by an election board of-
ficial that I was permitted to send
only one letter to the students out-
lining my views. My letter was prin-
ted by the University Duplicating
Service on Friday, and they dere
distributed on Sunday evening. My
opponent sent one letter through the
campus mail earlier in the week
and distributed a second sheet the
night before the election. Apparent-
ly he was not told that he was
limited to one flyer. I later dis-
covered that there was no limit
policy on the number of circulars
set by the election committee.

I am not implying that I was
purposely misled, rather I feet
that those on the election board
were not explicit in outlining the
specific rules of the campaign. I
suggest that the election committee
send each candidate a written state-
ment outlining all of the campaign
limitations such as the use of pos-
ters, limit of money to be spent,
and the like. Only when such writ-
ten guidelines are given to each

Black Studies

By TOM FICKLIN,

American colleges are, above all else, political in that values are pro-
moted and distributed by means of power and authority. Furthermore,
they have been stripped and shown to be operated with the same racist,
political, social, and economic dynamics as any other institution. Black
students demand Black Studies, that kind of program which will de-
velop black people who can work within and for the Black community;
these have been political demands. The struggle has been political in the
sense that the right of the college and university to rule unchallenged in
the traditional ways was being questioned.

What is essential to such a program is not only a knowledge of the
black man and his culture, but also that each item of the program be
planned in reference to a goal of liberation and development of black
people. For many years to come, Black ghettos will continue to exist as
separated communities, and full respect will not come to black people in
America, if it comes at all, until the black community as a whole is re-
spected. Black Studies proposals attempt to explore new ways to approach
socio-political change in modern America, at least from the vantage point
of black Americans. Have not some political science courses traditionally
been dealing with how groups operated effectively in the society? Have
not many of the economic courses not only dealt with mere description of
the existing economic order, but also with ways to strengthen and make
that order more viable? Are we unaware of the mass of research carried
on on the college campuses by scholars under contract with the goal in
the natural, physical, and political sciences.

The student is not to be trained to be a “‘credit to his race,” but to be
an asset to his people. They are not concerned only with the development
of teachers, social scientists, technicians, businessmen, and counselors;
they recognize the parallel need for research scientists, psychologists,
humanists, and even philosophers; for technical excellence cannot develop
in the absence of theoretical speculation. The black community is con-
trolled by foreigners, owned by foreigners, trade is handled by foreigners,
political control generally emanates from foreigners, education is de-
termined by foreigners, and economy is dependent upon foreigners. In

short, the black ghetto has less opportunity to regulate itself and to de-
termine its future than the American Colonies did when they chafed under
what they described as the tyrannical oppression of Great Britain. Realiz-
ing that respect will not come as long as the black ghetto remains in the
present state, many proponents of Black Studies therefore, are concerned
primarily with programs which will train people who can transform the

Dunlop Again

To the Editor

Although I have serious doubts
about most of what was said by
Miss May and Mssrs. Resnick,
Thompson, Hart, Clayton and Hen-
dershot (The Bucknellian, Feb. 26),
I must agree that my facts were a
bit inaccurate with regard to John
Dunlop’s attempt to encourage a
pro-administration opposition in the
ABS Presidential elections (The
Bucknellian, Feb. 23).

After investigating further, the
most recent version of the events
preceding the election is said to go
as follows:

Having observed that Bob Nach-
shin was a trong Presidential cand-
idate running against a less well-
known opponent, three students,
Resnick and Hart among them, met
several times during the one or two
weeks prior to the election in order
to determine if one of them should
consider opposing Nachshin (the as-
sumption being that one of them
would be tougher opposition).

In the meantime, Dunlop, who
has been uneasy about the increas-
ing number of ABS actions that
make obviously ‘“‘unrealistic’’ de-
mands of the Board of Trustees and
Faculty, was not particularly
pleased with the anticipated suc-
cession of Nachshin to the Presi-
dency of the ABS, fearing that
Nachshin would be ‘‘too radical.”
He made his feelings known to
either one or all three of the stu-
dents mentioned above when they
sought his advice about the election.
{ that time, he also encouraged
one of them to run for the office.
That person subsequently decided
not to run for one reason or an-
other.

Originally, I was led to believe
that Dunlop had initiated the dis-
cussion, but it now seems that my
source erred on that point. If Res-
nick, Hart or anyone else would like
to take issue with my story, I would
be more than happy to hear their
version.

To the Editor:

Gordon Fletcher’s letter in your
last issue needs a reply at two
levels. First, at the opinion level, I
question Fletcher’s attitude towards
booing a performer. He says that
he paid $5.50 and, for his money,
he has the right to boo a performer
if she does not meet his standards.

Editor

LL:

A performer is a human being, with
feelings like most of us.

Buying a ticket to a performance
means you can listen to a performer
and hopefully enjoy the experience.
It does not mean that you have to
enjoy it, but if you don’t, I’m not
sure you have any right to boo and
ridicule a person giving of themself
for you. Does buying a ticket make
you ‘the master’ and the performer
‘a slave’ to be treated as you wish?

A second level to question Mr.
Fletcher’s letter is the factual level.
In fact, the first show (which Flete-
her supposedly couldn’t attend) was
NOT any shorter than it would have
been in any other circumstances.
Neither the second show nor Kathy
Smith’s performance shortened it
one minute.

One correct thing said by Fletcher
is that Andy Meyer is responsible
for it all. He is. When we were
freshmen, before Andy brought con-
certs to Bucknell, there were two
major concerts. In the fall Dionne
Warwick performed. Arriving about
an hour late, she sang excellently,
although through a sound system

pinion, not personality traits.

The Editorial Board then searches
for further ‘proof’ of ABS failure by
saying that the new living unit re-
presentatives are ‘dead wood.’’ AS
‘evidence’ for this slander they ask
us to “witness the alacrity with
which the Senate has been dealt.”
... Lassume the board is ironically
pointing to the fact that the ABS
has been working on amending the
faculty version of the University
Senate for nearly 3 months. The fact
that the ABS has had to consider
over 60 amendments . . . some of
which are completely original with
the ABS and its “dead wood” mem-
bers, makes no impression on the
Board (the fact that the Senate may
well be the most important thing
to happen to Bucknell in 50 years
makes no impression either.). Many
ABS members have put in long
hours, thinking and rethinking, writ-
ing and rewriting, in an effort to
create the best possible Senate. The
fact that this concern is considered
to be evidence of “dead wood’’ in
our midst can only be attributed to
the Board’s own superficiality and
inexperience. Any group that em-
phasizes speed over comprehensive-
ness in matters such as the Senate
document would indeed be an ap-
propriate target for an attack by
The Bucknellian. The ABS, however,
has tried to retain the best of both
worlds, being both as thorough and
as efficient, as possible

After this brief attempt at con-
crete evidence the Editorial Board
stated that it doubts that the addi-
tion of the L.U.R.’s has made the
present ABS any more representa-
tive than “the unopposed oligarchy
which preceeded it.” Catchy phrase
that, ‘unopposed oligarchy.”’ Sounds
pretty damn sinister. Fortunately,
it has no real meaning. Unfortunate-
ly the Board used it to mislead its
readers. The oligarchy referred to
is, I assume, the ABS in its first
year of operation during the ad-
ministration of . . . Mel Hill. I have
no idea as to what the term “un-
opposed” refers. All the candidates
in that election had opponents and
rather strong ones as I recall. Per-
haps the Board means unopposed
by The Bucknellian.

In any event, the increase from
15 people to 31 people has allowed
a larger number of students to
participate, thus providing the op-
portunity for more ideas and view-
points. In many cases the new
L.U.R.’s have been able to report
directly on student opinion in their
constituencies. This is clearly an in-
crease in representation.

We now come to the Board’s idea
ot a “more honest form of student
organization” (though from what
we've seen of the Board’s ‘honesty’
so far, I have my doubts). The
editorial calls for a Student Fund-
ing Committee which ‘would recog-
nize itself as a necessary adminis-
trative agency and only that.’’ This
SFC would ‘‘avoid delusions of rep-
resentativeness and popular voice.”
The fact that the esteemed Editorial
Board thinks that a funding com-
mittee (or a Student Appropriations
Committee which is the name the
ABS uses) is a purely administra-
tive agency which need not bother
with the “popular voice” is rather
surprising . . . and rather naive.

The present Appropriations Com-
mittee (consisting of the 5 ABS of-
ficers and the 5 at-large members)
is responsible for the allotment of
$60,000 in student funds. It sets up
budgetary priorities and controls
the purse strings of the vast ma-
jority of student organizations, in-
cluding The Bucknellian. To say that
such an important group need not
bother with student opinion shows
a colossal ignorance of the prob-
lems of governance. How could we
decide who deserves more funds.
and who less without refering to the
needs and desires of the campus

population? If the members of this
SFC had no job but budgeting, how
could we be sure that their actions
would be responsive to changing
situations on campus? Another point
is that if all these administrative
committees (SFC, committee on ap-
pointments, etc.) are elected, the
problem of popular people winning
will still be present. . .

The idea of a student referendum
on all “important matters” is in-
teresting. Who will decide which
matters are important? There are
no official leaders, so who will deal
with the administration and faculty
in the negotiation of demands? If
everyone can vote in the open meet-
ings described (a system considered
and rejected during the formation
of the ABS), what will prevent block
voting by special interest groups?
What will prevent factioning and
political in-fighting (such as that
which often plagues the faculty)
from creating a worse morass than
that of the, at times, tedious ABS.
Clearly this new “honest’’ system
is without substance.

One further point of criticism re-
garding the editorial itself. The
Board claims that attendance is a
clear measure of the importance
which the students attach to a par-
ticular function. According to this
logic not only are ABS meetings
unimportant, but also Bucknellian
editorial meetings, anti-Vietnam
meetings, C.A. volunteer meetings
and just about everything else out-
side of fraternity parties, concerts
and Dunkle’s. I repeat that I be-
lieve the student body cares about
many things . . . It is only that
their motivation to actively par-
ticipate is often very low. It may
well be that the frustration that
causes this is especially acute at
Bucknell. . . In such situations those
who are motivated to take action
should do so, keeping the interests
of the others in mind

In closing, I think it worthwhile
to note that we should not think
that the Editorial Board of the
Bucknellian in any way believes in
the supposedly egalitarian system
it set down to replace the ABS. In
reality the Board (and I should note
here that all my references to the
Board refer only to those members
who voted in favor of the Feb. 26
editorials) believes that Bucknell is
totally apathetic and hence, worth-
less. They dislike the ABS because
it struggles to operate in what they
consider to be a vacum. In reality
they want and expect all attempts
at government to fail. They are
frustrated and, in many ways, un-
derstandably so.

Unfortunately, there can be no ex-
cuse for the personal attacks made
on the ABS candidates for Presi-
dent and Treasurer in the second
editorial, no excuse for using the
space that should have been de-
voted to objective analysis for
character slurs. Worst of all, there
can be no excuse for the gaps in
credibility which may be reopened
by these actions.

Yet, what can one expect from a
small group of people, ‘‘an unop-
posed oligarchy,” which is totally
convinced of its own righteousness
and cares not for outside opinion?
Indeed, what can one expect when
certain “power-seeking individuals”
are presumptuous enough to speak
from the podium of Bucknell’s mo-
nopoly press, caring not at all for
facts, for logic, or for the damage
they might do, caring only for their
own self-gratification?

much of the gym.

In the spring, Sam and Dave were
supposed to come, but we got, at
the last minute, Marvin Gaye and
Wilson Pickett. The concert started
late (an uncontrollable problem)
and was very disorganized. It lost
several thousand dollars.

Andy is now responsible for a
series that includes a low price
season ticket (try to match it at a
school with a gym our size), top
name artists (try to match them at
a school our size), and much new
talent (Tony Kosinec, coming with
Sea Train, has as much talent as
anybody I’ve heard in a long time).
Running these concerts takes a lot
of Andy’s time. By now he’s pro-
bably bought his books for this se-
mester, but before Chicago he had-
n't the time to.

It also takes the cooperation of an
intelligent dience, perceptive of
the problems in presenting concerts
here. Fortunately, in the last three
years, Bucknell has been one of the
best audiences on this coast

There is no glamor involved in
doing these concerts. Much work
has to be done during the concert
itself. Andy and others on the Com-
mittee often see very little or none
of the performance. There is a lot
of mental strain. After each con-
cert, I see that Andy has pulled
out about half of his beard.

If you have questions or doubts
as to fact, ask Andy. He will tell
you the truth because he knows it.
If you have opinions, tell Andy.
He'll listen.

Of course opinions are still yours,
and if you are a person who thinks.
as Mr. Fletcher does, that concerts
are like sporting events and you
want to boo, and if the people
around you don’t mind the dis-
courtesy to their enjoyment of the
concert, be not hindered by simple
consideration

Motivation
To the Editor:

It was with great dismay and
greater disillusionment in the in-
telligence of the Bucknell student
body that I read Mr. William Mates’
letter to the Editor in the March 2
issue of the Bucknellian. Although
continued discussion of a pass-fail
system might be better directed to
the Committee on Academic Regula-
tions, I feel motivated to answer
what I thought was a poorly organ-
ized, poorly thought out, grossly
trite and generally asinine answer
to your editorial of Feb. 23.

It seems the greatest misunder-
standing encountered in this argu-
ment is related to a question of
priorities: rather, it the primary
purpose of a university to act as an
educational institution or as a pre-
paration for future material ven-
tures? Naturally it is meant to
serve both of these purposes—but
which one should be given priority?

Possibly I am being cliche or
idealistic in thinking that the stu-
dent is attending a university to
learn just for the sake of learning.
What Mr. Mates is suggesting is
that, with the advent of technology,
students no longer attend a uni-
versity for the pleasure of learning,
but rather for a hollow background
that gives them a license for life.

Why should the rest of the student
body be hampered by students such
as Mates who feel the need for im-
posed motivation to “force” them
through college? If Mates doesn’t
feel that he has enough maturity
and responsibility to shape an ef-

fective educational experience for
himself then perhaps this shows the
failings of the traditional system to
prepare him for life. If he is unable
to motivate himself for a task from
within then he may find himself in
trouble when he fails to find ma-
terial motivation for everything he
must do to survive in the great big
outside world. What is really unfair
is for him to project his immaturity
on the rest of the student body.

My suggestion (though possibly
burdensome in terms of efficiency)
is to allow all students to make
their choice as to what courses they
will take pass-fail and which courses
they feel need a graded label for
future employment reference. This
could be done some time prior to
registration. Those students who
would not feel motivated without a
grade can thereby elect to have
themselves judged in the traditional
manner.

At any rate, I feel that more can
be gained by learning self-imposed
motivation rather than learning a
dependency on some outside moti-
vation. In the long run a more ma-
ture and capable student will de-
velop under the pass-fail system.

Sincerely,
John de Benedictis

Other Sides

To the Editor:

The other night at the meeting
for the Harrisburg Six, Prof. Man-
ning Smith asked when the “other
side’ would be presented. I should
like now to respond to his question.

I don’t think it is the responsibility
of the Bucknell Students for Peace
to arrange for a speaker or a panel
of speakers to discuss the govern-
ment view of the alleged conspir-
acy.

Therefore, I suggest to Prof.
Smith that he seize the initiative:
Do set up a meeting at which the
“other side” can be heard. I should
certainly make an effort to attend,
because I would find the evening
most interesting. Can any good
sense be made of the indictments?
I might even be persuaded to help
with some of the arrangements

Sincerely,

Obviously, white students will not benefit significantly from a program
restricted to this aim. The question is not whether a white student will
be banned but whether it is worth his time to participate since he will not
live or work within the black community. However, at an integrated col-
lege or university, an Afro-American Studies program, though focused on
this aim, should not be restricted to it. Indeed one objective of a Black
Stu Program should be to provide all white students with valid and
valuable information concerning the Afro-American experience to act as
a de-myabologizing experience and as a basis for the understandings they
will need to live responsibly in a multi-racial society Understandings of,
for example, the term liberation. People frequently fear the term because
they conceptualize it in relation to armed revolution. It is understandable
that many Ameri have sought to liberate themselves from what they

rded as oppression, they have picked up guns against the British,
against the Union, or group which opposed them. But for
Black people, psycholog: eration is as important as economic and
political liberation. As curricula of public schools are reformed to include
more Afro-American materials, and as the pride in identity is developed
in the elementary school, or even in pre-school experience, this particular
goal will become less important in college programs.

Curriculum is a troublesome issue. For example, curriculum at a pre-
dominately black institution in rural Georgia would not be identical with
a curriculum at a predominantly white institution in a northern city. For
example, Bucknell’s Black Studies Program, Afro-American Studies, or
Black Community and Educational Research Center curriculum will be
influenced by the black communities in the Lewisburg prison, Williamsport,
and the migrant workers. In addition it possibly will be a cooperative
campus, regional center Black Studies Program including Lycoming
College, Bloomsburg State, and Susquehanna University.

In conclusion, institutions of higher education must not limit their
vision to temporary solutions which will appease the demands of the
moment. Instead, they must carefully plan ways to insure stability and
continuity for such an intellectually significant program as the study of the
culture of a community numbering more than 25 million people, and the
preparation of leaders for that community. Perhaps higher education will
even discover a beneficial by-product if professors in other disciplines,
emulating the methods and objectives of teachers of Black Studies, decide
to restrain their ego-centric enthusiasm for their own specialty and to
concentrate instead upon developing academic programs which will educate
students to meet the needs of their society.

and was elected to Phi Eta Sigma,
national scholastic fraternity for
freshman men. Last September he
received the George R. Faint Prize
“for excellent scholarship during
the first three years.”

In announcing the awards, Dr. H.
Ronald Rouse, National Director of
the Foundation, said ‘“‘We are en-
couraged each year to find so many
young men and women who com-
bine intellectual curiosity and bril-
liance with a deep concern for so-
ciety’s needs. Tody there is too
much pessimism about the future
of higher education, and a tempor-
ary oversupply of Ph.D.’s has been
magnified out of all proportion. It
is important that fine students be
encouraged to consider careers of
college teaching, where their talents
add quality and relevance to high-
er education.”

The two-hundred and fifty Wilson
Fellowships offered annually in the
United States are tenable for one
year and are usually renewable.

Application is open to any student
pursuing graduate study in the hu-
manities, social, or natural sciences
and considering college teaching as
a career.

The fellowship is valued at two
thousand dollars per annum for liv-
ing expenses and up to one thousand
dollars for tuition.

Application for the Woodrow Wil-
son Fellowship is a long and dif-
ficult process. Applicants must be
nominated by a faculty member.
This is followed by the filing of an
application requiring a statement
of intellectual interest.

Preliminary screening is com-
pleted on the basis of the applica-
tion and semi-finalists are required
to attend regional interviews before
a panel of three.

All semi-finalists receive letters
of recommendation for financial aid
to be sent to the three graduate

schools of their choice.

As a result of interviews, final-
ists’ applications are sent to a cen-
tral committee for national screen-
ing. Awards are distributed on the
basis of this final screening

dents who have been named Wood-
row Wilson Fellows or Designates

Following a night spent in the
homes of members of the com-
munity, many of whom were fac-
ulty members of the nearby Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, 130 singers
and instrumentalists travelled to
Atlantic City, New Jersey for an-
other concert at the Chalfonte-Had-
don Hotel.

The audience was made up of
members of the eastern division of
the National Music Educators Con-
ference, including Latham, com-
poser of the “Te Deum,” who in-
troduced his own work. The two
pieces were received by the large
crowd with a standing ovation.

A record is being made of their
performance and may be ordered
by contacting the music department
before March 15

The exhausted group returned to
campus Sunday afternoon in time
for a 6:30 rehearsal in preparation
for the concert to be given the fol-
lowing night with the Pennsylvania
3allet. The Chorale combined with
the ballet company and its orches-
tra, conducted by Maurice Kaplow,

“Speaking for the guys, there is
at least as much enthusiasm among
seniors as juniors, if not better, for
seniors have one more year €x-
perience, and one more year set-
tling down.”

Anne Wright, Residence Director
of Roberts, is a graduate of Hiram
College where the custom is to hire
both junior and senior women to
counsel freshmen.

She specified that under that sys-
tem freshmen and upperclass were
mixed in the dorms, although some
halls contained a majority of fresh-

rf Black

istics of West African tribal music,
which included ‘‘functionalism,”
“rythmic complexity,” the “call and
response” pattern, extensive use of
percussion, improvisation, and the
use of a “gapped scale” (very few

| notes used in a given melody).

With the addition of simple in-

| struments (banjo, harmonica) to the

field holler and work song, a
“primitive blues’’ was produced.
Like all blues, this early form was
criticism, complaint,
dissatisfaction with the world”
which “‘offered no hope for the fu-
ture.” The “highly syncopated”
scales of primitive blues melodies
were much like the African gapped
scale.

The next step in the development
of Afro-American music was the
addition of more sophisticated in-
struments to produce the ““Memphis
Blues” and the “St. Louis Blues”
as heard on the “race records’’ of
the 1920’s and 1930's. This music
“reflected the disillusionment of
thousands of blacks who moved
north after World War I’ and

men. One counselor was assigned
for all the freshmen on a floor.

Reflecting on this, Anne con-
tinued, “It depends on the indivi-
dual: if you get good people it
works just fine. It doesn’t have any-
thing to do with class at all.”

A further advantage she stated is
having one or two repeating J.C.’s
in the dorm with experience.

Anne also clarified that Miss Gor-
don, Director of Freshman Resi-
dence Programs, had asked the
Residence Directors to consult the
J.C.’s in this change: erall, the
majority of female J.C.’s were for
allowing senior women to be fresh-
man counselors.”’ She re-stated, “It
has worked well for the men, and
we're more interested in getting the
person.”

Music

“proved blues were a powerful ve-
hicle for voicing social discontent.”

“Rhythm and Blues” then ap-
peared, which when added to Coun-
try and Western produced the rock
‘n’ roll of Elvis Presley, and when
blended with the “Gospel Sound”
resulted in contemporary Soul
music. Even today, one is able to
see the “particular, strident tone
from Afric in Soul.

Another category of African in-
fluence on American music is that
of religious music. The “Spirituals
which resulted from the conversion
of Africans to Christianity’ re-
flected their ‘‘pain and disillusion-
ment” but were “usually optimistic
for the future.’ The Spirituals in-
cluded “‘percussion, hand clapping,
and call and response,” all of which
show African influence.

American jazz is one of the most
famous forms of African inspired
music, made great by such per-
formers as Louie Armstrong, Diz-
zie Gillespie and others. Aithough
“the American Black has lost po-
session of jazz,’ the whole world
has picked it up.

Japanese Program Excels

East Asian Studies Provide Unusual Opportunities

By DAN MARTIN

“We are made more aware of
ourselves after we have been ex-
posed to a culture distinct from our
own,” is a statement which helps
clarify Dr. David Lu’s view of the
validity of the East Asian studies
program at this University.

Dr. Lu is director of the Univers-
ity’s center for Japanese studies.

The Japanese program began here
in 1965, with a grant from the U.S.
Office of Education. This allotment,
the first bestowed upon undergrad-
uate institutions, included gifts to
thirty-three educational centers for
use in developing specialized stud-
ies. Seven of the institutions es-
tablished East Asian programs,
while three chose to pursue Japan-
ese language and culture as their
main area of study.

Even before this generous grant,
the University maintained a long
tradition of non-Western history pro-
grams, including courses in the
history of China, India, and Japan
at the time of World War Two, and
the full time employment of a pro-

fessor of Asian history in the fifties.

At the time of the federal grant,
a decision had to be made as to the
area of concentration of the Uni-
versity’s program-Chinese or Japan-
ese. The latter was finally decided
upon, and Japan was made the
doorway to the understanding of
East Asia.

Several considerations affected
the choice, among them being the
important fact that Japan was at
that time, and still remains an open
society, while China existed behind
impregnable barriers.

Furthermore, Japan retained
much of China in her cultural heri-
tage, and Japanese reports of the
events within Communist China
were among the most complete and
accurate available.

On a more practical level, know-
ledge of Japanese language and cul-
ture is of immense importance in
modern times. Presently the third
largest industrial power in the
world, Japan offers great oppor-
tunities for knowledgable foreign-
ers. Tremendously advanced in

‘The Trojan Women’:
A Play About Wars

By MARC POWERS

Next weekend, Cap & Dagger will
present Euripides’ The Trojan Wo-
men, a Greek tragedy condemming
the brutality and futility of war, in
which there is no actual victor.

The setting of the play is the des-
ecrated, destroyed city of Troy,
the day after the ten year Trojan
War was culminated by the strate-
gem of the wooden horse.

The basic story is that of the
Trojan women during their last day;
the revelation of their future as
slaves and/or whores of the Greeks,
and of their dedication to fallen
Troy, their memory. The physical
play ends with the city burning and

Horowitz to Present
Third World’ Paper

By LINDA DIETRICK

Dr. Irving Louis Horowitz, pro-
fessor of sociology at Rutgers Uni-
versity and well-known authority
on the “Third World,” will speak
here during the Third World Week-
end, April 1-4. He will present a
paper entitled “‘A Reappraisal of
the Condition of the Third World in
the 1970's.”

Dr. Horowitz is Director of Stud-
ies in Comparative International De-
velopment at Livingston College. Be-

fore coming to Rutgers, he was Pro- |
fessor of Sociology at Washington |

University at St. Louis for seven

years. In the past, he has taught |

extensively in Latin America as well

as Europe, and has held visiting |

appointments at the Universities of

Wisconsin, California, and the State

University of New York.

Dr. Horowitz is also editor-in-
chief of TRANS-action, the largest
social science
United States. Among his books on
the subject of the Third World are
Latin American Radicalism (1969);
Masses in Latin America (1970); The

Rise and Fall of Project Camelot |
(1967); and Three Worlds of De- |
velopment: The Theory and Prac- |
tice of International Stratification.

the ‘victorious’ Greeks dragging
off their booty. But, the end is only
the beginning, for the victorious
Greeks become the vanquished vic-
tims. The play has not yet ended,
and it will not end until mortal man
realizes the futility of war. Euripi-
dies’ tragedy is far from being
“dead’’—unfortunately for man it is
still very much alive.

In this production, under the di-
rection of Dr. Harvey Powers, the
Jean-Paul Sartre adaptation will be
performed. Sartre’s version, more
contemporary in style and more
forceful in attack, is most conducive
to the style of the production itself.
In his presentation, Dr. Powers is
attempting to merge literal imagery
with physical representation. Pro-
phecy of the future and its dream-
like actuality take form simultane-

verbal desecration becomes
ysical; the past, present, and fu-
ture all become a singular element.

manorial manuscripts superior to
those of Europe. The first non-West-

eyes of a technically equal but
culturally opposite nation.

Every other year, the Japanese
department offers a summer trip
to Japan, which involves extensive
study along with pleasurable re-
laxation.

The 1970 tour, led by Dr. Lu, con-
centrated its attention on art his-

and Nara-a replica of the ancient
capital of Changan, and contempor-
ary government and politics, which
comprised interviews with major
party spokesmen, a luncheon with
the Speaker of the House, Mr. Naka
Funada, and tea with Prime Minis-
ter Eisaku Sato.

Other interesting experiences of
the group included a tour of Tokyo’s
subways and slums by a metropoli-
tan government official, a study of
farm administration on the island
of Shikoku, and a visit to Japan’s
Expo °70.

The University sponsors several
other programs in connection with
East Asian studies. Informal rela-

Japanese universities in order to
promote a Junior year abroad in

Several faculty members have in-
cluded East Asian topics in their
disciplines, including courses in art,
religion, geography, and music,

The Real Red Baron
von Richthofen

By ANTHONY GOSSE

We all know something about the
famous aces of WW I: Rickenbacker,
Bishop, Guynemer, Boelcke, and, of course,
that ace of aces, the Red Baron himself,
Manfred von Richthofen. But it is generally
the legend about these men that is familiar,
not the reality. Truth, however, is not
only stranger than fiction, it’s a lot more
interesting

The latest book on the subject is Dale
Titler’s “‘The Day the Red Baron Died.”
“The Day the —” is a fashionable and
familiar gimmick and Titler’s main con-
cern is to prove that an Australian anti-
aircraft machine-gun battery got Richtho-
fen from the ground rather than the official
victor, and undistinguished RAF pilot
named Brown. The significance of the book,
however, lies not in this sort of detail but
in the picture of the last days of the man
himself, even then a legend to the German
and British (the sensible French hated him
and despoiled his grave).

Actually, it doesn’t really matter who

t the Red Baron. If it had not been that

y, it would have been the next or a few
days thereafter, for something within Richt-
hofen had quietly broken and neither he
nor anyone else knew it. The pressure on
him was unbearable: two years of combat
six weeks was the average life span of a
pilot); the relentless discipline he main-
tained over himself and his men; his care-
ful training of them—a detailed critique of
the a’s performance man by man after
each patorl. One of them meeting him short-
ly before his death at 25 remarked on how
old he looked. A few days earlier he had
lost for the first time his famous cool.

that cognition which he rightfully de-

rd, the one notable exception

the Nobel nominating committee

as cited his singular achievements

ck as 1967. (Maniacs in the Fourth

ension was recently up for the National

Book Award). However, for the All-too-

many the name Kilgore Trout still evokes

images of the genus Salmo, that species
of freshwater game fish.

To my knowledge, only one article has
appeared concerning him in the mass media

“Fishing for Trout,’ Saturday Review
4/27/67); therefore, relatively little is
known of his enigmatic character. Here,
the elementary nature of this exposition
must be stressed. For only through the
study of his major themes can an idea of
the man behind them emerge. These themes
are presented below: their analysis for
the most part, is left to the reader.

A pregnant area for the induction of
clues might lie in the works of Jorge Luis
Borges, for few are aware of the influence
this American has had upon his work. In
Other Inquisitions (Washington Square
Press, 1962) Borges wrote, “If one ventured
into the labyrinths of my mind and stumbled

tically no range is unimportant. He should
never have been there doing what he was
doing: chasing another plane for too many
minutes at ground level over enemy anti-

aircraft. All in all, the picture of von Rich-
thofen is rather sad. The legendary hero
was in fact a strangely limited person,
merely a hunter, though of course amaz-
ingly gifted at his trade. He worked at it
just a bit too long, things began to give,

and the law of averages reached out its
bony finger.

The aftermath is a further deflating of
the legend. While his body was stiffening
in rigor mortis the souvenir hunters picked
him clean. The Australian chaplain went
around afterwards trying to recover his
handkerchief, wallet, family letters and
photographs, ring, watch, even his flying
boots. The body was carried on a sheet
of metal roofing to a nearby hanger and
the curious came to stare and scrounge
what was left. Already the RAF and Aus-
tralian hierarchy were manuvering for
credit for the kill. The official autopsy was
perfunctory and found for the RAF. Then
the Public Relations Officers got on the
job. An elaborate funeral was arranged,
carefully photographed and written up.
Distribution of information was first rate.
Even the Germans got story, photos, and
a large wreath

In the classic ending of his fight with
the Red Baron, Snoopy shouts ‘‘Curse you,
Red Baron!’ just as a tatoo of bullets
punctures his Sopwith Camel. The scene
embodies that best of all ironies, the truth,
for there really was a curse on the Red
Baron, but Snoopy was lucky; the Real Red
Baron would have shot at the dog instead
of the doghouse.

The Importance of
Foreign Languages

By MILLS F. EDGERTON, JR.

I wouldn’t be a student and teacher of foreign languages if Iweren’t convinced that what
I do has enough intrinsic value to justify my spending my whole life at it. In the following
paragraphs I have tried to outline some of what the study of a foreign language has to offer

to today’s student in his quest for a shape to his life and a semblance of rhyme and reason
in the world.

A great many people in this country today have come to consider the study of foreign
language at worst a useless frill and at best an innocent pastime—except, of course, for the
relatively few clearcut instances in which knowledge of one or more foreign languages has
some direct, practical justification, as in the case of those relatively few people who work
in academic disciplines, types of business or governmental activities in which such knowledge
is a practical necessity. It is true, of course, that for some people the study of a foreign
language is interesting and fun; for them such study needs no further justification. Personally,
however, I would question whether it is reasonable and responsible to spend any very appre-

ciable proportion of an undergraduate curriculum working at something which is fun and
games and nothing more.

The most important single fact, I think, about any given language is that it is unique
code—a system of symbols—in which people transmit and receive messages about them-
selves and about the world in terms of a conceptual system which may be partly natural but
is certainly for the most part artificial—a cultural artifact, a product of history. Each such
code has implicit in it a world-view. Another way of saying the same thing is to point out
that a language, as a system of symbols standing for a system of concepts, is the expression
of the collective personality of all of the people who are its native speakers. In order for us
to be able to say that any group of people speak the same language, we must also be able to
say that they are all members of the same culture. But these are facts that it is difficult,
perhaps impossible to understand fully as long as a man remains imprisioned in his own
language and his own culture.

We live in a pragmatic age and we live in a country in which pragmatism has always
loomed large. Americans are well aware that most of them do not really need to know any
foreign language in order to lead full and rich lives. But what they do not understand is
that their lives could be much fuller and much richer if they possessed the added dimension
of experience that can be had from an intimate penetration of another way of looking at
the world. The best way to obtain such insight—short of actually spending an extended period
of time as a member of another culture—is through the vicarious experience to be de-
rived from the intimate study of another language and the system of concepts and values it
symbolizes. Such study must necessarily include more than traditional grammar and litera-
ture. It must include serious treatment of the social, economic, religious and other aspects
of the way of life and world-view of the speakers of that language.

There are a great many people in the world—there are a great many people in the
English-speaking world in particular—who see nothing but an obstacle to communication in
the existence of a variety of languages in the world. They maintain that we should all be
better off if there were only one language spoken over the whole surface of the planet. They
maintain that at the very least everyone in the world should have a common language even
if local languages survive for local purposes. Ultimately, however, a single language for the
entire human race, submerging all others, would be a terrible impoverishment of the rich

variety of ways we now have of looking at life and the world. There are those who argue
that this would be a small price to pay for peace in the world, for, they say, it is precisely

“LREEN

the fact that different peoples see the world differently and attach different values to dif-
ferent aspects of life that leads to strife, and war. I suggest that these people fail to take
into account the possibility, even the probability that this same logic would eventually be
applied on the level of the individual. It it is true that we can eliminate causes of strife
and hatred among nations by eliminating whatever makes them different from one another,
then the same would hold for individual human beings: the more like one another we are
and the less separate and distinct each individual personality is, the less likely it is that
conflict will arise among us. The result, of course, in the long run would be a gray uniformity
in thought and deed of which I, personally, would want no part.

ore Trout, The Man

upon its innermost chamber, there he
would find a plaque inscribed with a single
word: Trout.”
By now most of us are familiar with
2 gar Borges plays with time and
as Borges plays with the rid-
dies of the universe, Trout tools with those
of man. Often his work is oozing with
religious overtones; let us consider, for ex-
ample, The Gospel From Outer Space. In
it Trout tells us of a visitor from another
world who comes to Earth with the in-
tention of comprehending why Christians
find it so easy to kill one another. He con-
cluded that part of the reason was slip-
shod story telling in the New Testament.
He also found that instead of fulfilling their
intentions of teaching universal love, the
Gospels actually taught this: Before you
kill someone, make certain that he has no
connections. And so the flaw in the Christ
stories presented itself. Christ, who looked
like a nobody, was actually the son of an
omnipotent being. Since the readers under-
stood this, when they came to the cruxific-
tion they naturally thought: Oh boy, they
sure picked the wrong guy that time! There-
fore, implicit in the stories is the idea that
their are right people to murder-those with-
out connections.

Understanding that, the visitor rewrote
the Gospels. This time Jesus really was a

ARTs

nobody, but he still said what was said
that he said in the originals. One day the
people became bored and decided to crucify
Christ for kicks. (They couldn’t imagine
any repercussions since he didn’t look like
much). And then it happened. Just as the
nobody was about to die, the Vox Dei came
thundering down and announced that he

You cannot touch me

was adopting the bum and that from then
on he had the full powers and privileges
of the most powerful being in the Universe.
So it went.

As you can see, there is little question
as to why the New York Times found
Visitor, ‘The finest example of the in-
finite regress this age has yet produced.”
Then there is an author whom Trout re-
sembles, one William Tallis whose work is
typified in Apes and Essence. This sem-
blance can best be seen in Trout’s Gutless
Wonder: the story of a robot with bad
breath. Human in action and appearance,
this robot was programmed to drop napalm
on people. No one found this particularly
bothersome, but that breath! Not until his
halitosis cleared up was he accepted into
the Human Race.

But let us not sweat over things, as
Machiavelli once said, for there is also a
lighter side to Trout which we should, at
least, acknowledge. For example, consider
The Money Tree. Twenty dollar bills instead
of leaves were sprouted by its branches.
And as could be expected, it attracted men
who killed each other at its roots (and made
very good fertilizer). It grew suprisingly
well. Wow!

There he is. Kilgore Trout, the Master
in brief. Indisputably, he ranks as one of
the genii of our age, and possibly of all
time. Yet this article was spun from the
barest threads. The one thing it should
make clear is the utter lack of biographical
information concerning its subject. If any
individual has any of importance, kindly
send it to this newspaper, in care of the
Literary Editor.

season with a fine 9-2 record by
beating Lehigh 64-49. It was a see-

swam to the first of his two wins in
the 200 freestyle, which combined
with co-captain Jack Krohmer’s
second place finish but BU only
one point behind.

Then freshmen Steve Winings and

But Bobby Young, still coming on

O’Keeffe, Bucknell’s only double
winner of the day, won his second
event with co-captain Huffman tak-
ing third in the 500 freestyle. Bob
Rasmussen and Matt Slick came up
with a second and a third respec-
tively to give the home team a 51-
46 lead going into the 3 meter div-
ing.

Coach Ron Jenkins’ divers came
through and the 400 yard freestyle
relay of Winings, Landes, O'Keeffe
and Krohmer added the icing to the
cake by winning that event in the
time of 3:23.0.

The Bison mermen looked at this
victory as a sort of revenge for last
year’s loss at the MAC Champion-
ship. But the swimmers realize that
the real test comes next weekend at
this year’s MAC tournament.

Lehigh coach Roy Nichols said
that Saturday’s meet ‘‘doesn’t mat-
ter.” He, like Bucknell Coach Dick
Russell, is aiming toward the MAC
Championship. Both coaches, when
asked for comments concerning the
MACs replied ‘We're ready.”

University Division swimming and
diving championships are taking
place this Saturday at Temple Uni-

The three-day affaire concluding
on Saturday evening will include 16
swimming and two diving events.
Lehigh, the defending champion,
figures to be the pre-meet favorite
with the Bisons, LaSalle and Temple
also having a chance. The Engine-
ers scored 144 points to the Big
Blue’s 12644 in 1970.

It may seem unusual that Lehigh
would be the favorite because the
Engineers lost to both LaSalle and

Bucknell in dual meets. However,
the exceptional strength in the but-

y and individual medely events
Nichols has on
of great benefit

in tiring championship
meets.

been gearing his squad toward the
MAC’s all year. He said, ‘‘Last
year we were overconfident, but
now we're cast in the role of the
underdog. It’s a different feeling
because it’s the first time in five
years that a Bucknell team has not
been the favorite. Our men are
physically ready and from now on
it’s all mental.”

Junior Peter O'Keeffe, leads this
year’s group of swimmers. O’Keef-
fe won the 100 and 200-yard free-
styles last year as a Bison sopho-
more. He could compete in those
events, or in the 500-yard freestyle,
the two backstrokes, or the indivi-
dual medley events.

Defending 200-yard backstroke
champion Bob Young, is also re-
turning. Young is making a remark-
able comeback after a knee opera-
tion in January. The Bison sopho-
more swam in two meets this sea-
son, winning both of them. Junior
Paul Landes, and sophomore Dute
Otto, should also pick up points for
the Herd in the backstroke.

Bucknell freshman Steve Winings,
is expected to provide stiff competi-
tion for Lehigh’s Phil Hogan, the
defending champ, in the 50-yard
freestyle. Co-captain Hike Huffman,
is counted upon as a point pro-
ducer in the 500 and 1,650-yard free-
styles. Frosh Gary Norton, should
do well at 1,650.

Lehigh’s frosh Charles O’Lough-
lin is the favorite in the breaststroke
events, but don’t count out the Bi-
sons’ Matt Slick, and Bob Rasmus-
sen, last year’s runner-up at 200-
yards.

Bucknell could have its finest div-
ing combination in years with fresh-
man Bob Richards and Ron Farr. In
last week’s dual meet with Lehigh,
poth Richards and Farr beat out
the Engineers’ Tom Dillman, and
Dillman was runner-up in both
events last year at the MAC's.

Before the season started, Russell
stated that the team’s one objective
was to win back the MAC title. The
Orange and Blue mermen compiled
a 9-2 dual meet record and now is
drawing near on the coveted goal.
Bucknell has won the MAC crown
in 1960, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968
and 1969.

Bucknell’s rifle team ended its
season matches with a win against
the University of Delaware. In what
could have been a close match the
shooters defeated Delaware by al-
most 100 points, 1250-1159. Combin-
ing for the winning score were
Karen Reid, Ron Mertz, John Tub-
bs, John Dickerson, and Steve
Boyer. ;

The team ended the season with
a 7-5 record. Coming up on April 3
is the league tournament in Harris-
burg. Bucknell has a good chance
to bring back both individual and
team awards and to avenge its
earlier losses.

Editor’s Note: Following are predictions for each event in the Middle

weekend. Some men have been included in more than the allowed three
individual events because it is impossible to determine exactly where they
will be swimming. For this reason a team score has not been predicted.
Some outstanding men have not been included, but many of the competi-

With Loss to Syracuse

By JIM NORTHRIDGE
st Saturday the Bison grapplers
traveled to Syracuse and suffered
a stinging 3. setback
Junior Mark Ramage averted a
shutout for’ the matsters as he
edged by Guy Rocha 9-8 in the 134

was scoreless, but Ramage, work-

second period, picked up five points
as he took Rocha down and then
cradled him up tight. Trading an

Bucknell’s top two wrestlers, Al
Loesch and Tom Rivoire, both suf-
fered close losses. Loesch dropped

caught in a five point move in the
first period before he could proceed
to work on even terms with his op-
ponent

This Friday and Saturday the
grapplers are at Gettysburg for the
MAC championships.

Again, co-captains Al Loesch and
Tom Rivoire should have the best
chances in the tournament. Loesch
possessed an outstanding 11-2 record

while Rivorie, an MAC champ last
year, has a 10-3 mark.

Coach Richard Schumacher said
that the Bisons have an excellent
opportunity to show what we’ve
learned and can do.” He feels that
each member on the squad is
capable of placing and earning
valuable team points.

The varsity squad will consist of
a young team with three juniors,
three sophomores and four fresh-
men. However, they have learned
much this season and are deter-
mined to make up for the fact that
they failed to achieve a winning
season record.

Runners Show Improvement;
IC4A Meet Offers Stiff Test

By JEFF QUINZER

Several runners turned in their
top career times at this weekend’s
Delaware Invitational and perform-
ances in general continued to im-
prove as Coach Gulden and the
winter track team prepared for
their biggest meet of the season,
the upcoming Inter-Collegiate Ama-
teur Athletic Association of America
invitational meet. More practically
known as the IC4A’s, the meet is
the equivilent of the eastern champ-
ionships and will be held in Jadwin
Gym at Princeton this Friday and
Saturday.

This marks the first year that
this school will compete in the
IC4A’s, a meet in which a school
must receive invitations to compete.
In order to receive an invitation,
the individual performers must
meet certain qualifying standards.
Coach Gulden expects the competi-
tion to be the stiffest the team has
faced yet. “This is usually the most
competitive of any meet held in the

O’Keefe Guns for Triple Crown
As MAC Swim Tourney Begins

By DAVE COULTER

In a year that Bison athletic
teams have witnessed victory and
defeat, hope frustration, the
swim team has provided a shining
example of the excellence which
can be attained through the diligent
efforts of coach and team.

The swim team is presently en-
gaged in the battle for the MAC

at the All-MAC meet at

One of the standout per-
formers on the Bison squad is
Peter O’Keeffe, whi will be gun-
ning for three first places in the
meet

However, what “really matters’

Peter and the team is not the

contests, but the MAC

“Last year Lehigh won the

three relays, and that was the dif-

ference. This year the relays could

once again decide the meet,’’ he
forecasts.

Lehigh has been rated a slight
favorite over the Bisons to reclaim
the crown this year, in spite of BU’s
64-49 triumph over Lehigh at the
Freas-Rooke Pool last week.

O'Keeffe believes, however, that
the big difference in the team this
year is their ‘‘ability to win the big
meets, and the close ones.’ Also a

team spirit has developed with
‘everyone cheering for the whole
team . we’re a lot closer.” Both
of these Bison assets will be tested
to the utmost as the final events
of the MAC’s approach

Something has definitely been

orking in the Bison’s favor so far
this year. As Peter O’Keeffe looks
b over the season he finds that
‘the Cornell meet really sticks out
in my mind, as we played them in
water polo as well as swimming,
and had developed a great amount
of animosity toward them and their
coach. We wanted to beat them
real bad - and Syracuse, too. Rut-
gers was our worst defeat. The

team was thinking about the Lehigh
meet (instead of Rutgers), which
was probably good because we
didn’t get down afterwards. Last
year the loss to Rutgers hurt at the
MAC’s because we were still down.”

At the MAC meet O’Keeffe’s per-
sonal goal consists of victories in
the 100 and 500 yd. freestyle and
the 200 yd. backstroke. Although
one swimmer from Temple has had
1 better time in the 500, Pete be-
lieves the triple is still within his
reach

He notes that there is a certain
‘loneliness’ in swimming, “you
can’t just start talking to the guy
next to you like in other sports
There is also the challenge of get-
ting psyched for a race. “I often
get myself psyched up by a fear of
failure,’’ O’Keeffe explains. “I con-
vince myself that something awful
will happen if I lose.’’

H er, losing has not been
Pet way. This is his first year
with the 500 yd. event, but he es-
tablished himself as a_ potential
MAC champ in this ra He recog-
nizes that there is some ‘a think-
ing in this longer race, ‘‘you have
to pace yourself more, deciding
where to slow down and speed up.”
The ‘100’ remains his favorite
race, as he has more experience
and confidence in the shorter event.

His speed is a prime asset in
longer races where he feels he can
“outsprint them at the end if I can
stay with them the rest of the
race.’ The Bison swimmer also
sees the middle distance events as
tougher than the shorter or longer
races, as “one can exceil in dis-

with hard work or the sprints

h talent, but the rniddle distances
require both.’

Peter O’Keeffe has indeed shown
his all around swimming abilities
this year while smashing records
and capturing honors for his team
and school. During the spring re-
cess, he and Steve Winings will
travel to Iowa St. for the Nationals.
They both are ranked among the
top ten in their respective events
100 back and 50 free), but admit
they will have to work even harder
to get to the finals of the rugged
championship competition
While not working out with the
swim team, the BU junior works
toward his economic degree. He
plans to progress to graduate school
after Bucknell with his sights set
on the banking field
Peter remains somewhat disen-
chanted with the ‘“‘overemphasis on
social life here at nell.”” He
admits that he is inclined to be both
a conservative and a realist.

As the season draws to a close
O’Keeffe and the team must look
forward to next season, when they
will return nearly the same squad,
lacking only the services of talented
seniors Jack Krohmer and Mike
Huffman. Pete looks for a continued
strong showing by the Bison team
next year under Coach Russell.

Congratulations, praise and sup-
port are certainly in order for both
Peter O’Keeffe and the Bison team
for their successes and devoted toil
in their quest for athletic excellence.

East,”’ he emphasized. “It can even
be rougher than the Millrose Games
or the AAU meets. This is consis-
tently the tougest of any meet I’ve
seen.”

Just one look at the field would
support that conclusion. Although
this is mainly an eastern invita-
tional, Notre Dame, Michigan State
and Duke will be represented as
well as eastern powers such as
Maryland and defending champion
Villonova, which is again the team
to beat.

Gulden is optimistic about the up-
coming meet. “The times are en-
couraging,” he said. “‘We just keep
improving and bringing the times
down. Even the boys who are not
placing that high are still running
well; almost everyone has im-
proved.”’

Examples of the continual im-
provement can be found in the re-
sults of the Delaware Invitational
held this past Friday and Saturday
Paul Hermle turned in his best
time ever in the 600-yard run (1:15-
.5) while John Larner’s lifetime best
(4:31.8) won him fifth place in the
mile run.

In other results from that meet,
Len Dillinger took first place in the
long jump at 20 feet, 7 inches and a
fifth in the high jump with a leap
of 6 feet and one half inch, Tom
Hagerty was sixth in the 880-yard
run (2:00.5), Bill Hamilton ran a
6.6 in the semi-finals of the 60-yard
dash and freshman Scott Bartran
ran a 9:56 for the two-mile. The
two-mile relay team of Bill Ledger-
wood, Paul Hermle, John Larner
and Tom Hagerty took second with
a time of 8:09.3.

While most of the team returned
after Friday night’s events, Rich
Francel and Bob Smith stayed
overnight for the invitational on
Saturday. Smith took a first in the
triple jump with a jump of 44 feet
¥% inch and Francel ran a 1:57 in
the 880.

After the IC4A’s, the Bisons will
compete in the East Stroudsburg
Invitational on March 13 for the
final meet of the winter season

Seniors Learn Child
Aiders ‘Just Kidding’

By LUCY TYRRELL

“It was an unfortunate experience
and a mistake,” asserted Jeff Seng-
stack, president of the class of ’71,
when he referred to the sponsorship
funds given last year by that class
to Save the Children Federation
(SCF).

“We wanted to develop a social
awareness through the class con-
tribution,” he explained, ‘“‘and make
a significant difference somewhere,
helping people who need help—but
the appreciation just wasn’t there.”

In the fall of 1969, after consider-
able thinking, the class of '71 chose
to give a contribution to SCF, an
international child welfare agency.

The class registered with SCF
their interest in making one large
contribution, specifying that it be
utilized to help a family in Ap-
palachia.

With substantial sponsorship funds
sent by the class of ’71 and a col-
laborating contributor, the Federa-
tion made an interest-free loan to
the Black family in Greenville, Ten-
nessee. The money was to be used
to purchase needed equipment for

BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA ———

Zeller Releases Unofficial Figures

Collegiate Athletics’ Budget Reduced

By ROBERT WENDEL

An increase of almost $80,000 in
scholarships appeared in the re-
vised University budget for the
coming fiscal year, announced Dr.
John F. Zeller, Vice-President of
Administration and Finance. How-
ever, much of this income was off-
set by a reduction of $45,000 in
graduate funds.

Although many individual expendi-
tures were affected, the total net
change came to only an $18,000 re-
duction.

Substantial changes include a de-
crease of $86,000 in the total Uni-
versity income, the majority of
which was due to a increase in tab-
ulated tuition of $100,000 and re-
search funding of $35,000.

Some of the larger reductions in-
clude a cut 0 000 from adminis-
trative salaries, the majority of
which is due to the elimination of
the position of Dean of Business

New Police Chief Speaks
Heiter: ‘Raids Are Conceivable’

By CATHLEEN EVANS

“I€ University students are going
to act like drunkards, criminals or
Communists, we'll certainly ac-
comodate them,” promised Lewis-
burg Chief of Police, Donald Heiter.
He continued, “If the students want
to flirt with the law, then at some-
time in the future there may be
repurcussions or arrests made.”

Not wanting to continue the para-
noia that plagued the campus dur-
ing the ‘‘Chicago” concert, and
wanting to assure the students of
a passive position unless provoked,
he stresses, “I won't make any
threats as to raids being made on
or off campus, but I will make a
promise that if the laws are not
followed, then raids will be con-
ducted for illegal use of alchohol
or narcotics and other illegal drugs.
This can happen anywhere in the
borough under my jurisdiction—even
in private homes,” and anywhere
else on campus by federal, state or
county police.

Unlike many townspeople, he
doesn’t feel that the University is

the major supplier of drugs for the
high school, but he feels there are
a number of other sources within a
100 mile radius.

He cautions that the University
is not a ‘“‘sanctuary,”’ as part of the
area is in the Lewisburg borough
and part under the jurisdiction of
the East Buffalo Township.

Any of his policemen can be depu-
tized by the sheriff and go any-
where in the county, or become
deputy marshalls and work for the
federal government, a_ practice
which is now being utilized in the
conduction of drug and other in-
vestigations on campus.

Attributing most problems be-
tween police and students during de-
monstrations to outsiders, he notes,
“We're here to protect you as stu-
dents and townspeople, but when
outsiders come in, we don’t know
who’s who. We’re trying to relate
to the students and citizens here
that they’re jeopradizing their own
lives just because of these out-
siders.”

He makes a second promise that
“The first time students throw

Irish Senator Discusses
Political Strife in Ireland

Michael Yeats, chairman of the
Irish senate and only son of the
poet William Butler Yeats, and his
wife Grainne, a harpist, will present
a lecture-recital tonight. Open to
the public, the program will be
given in Vaughan Lit. auditorium at
8 p.m.

There will also be an open class
in which Yeats will discuss religious
strife and current political develop-
ments in Ireland at 9 a.m. Wed-
nesday in 204A Coleman Hall.

Newly-elected chairman of the
Irish senate, Mr. Yeats’ post is
comparable to that of the Speaker
of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. He is a leading spokesman
for the government party in the
Irish senate and is one of the
founders of the Irish branch of the
European movement.

Senator Yeats is also a profes-
sional music critic and an authority
on Irish folk music. His wife is

widely acclaimed throughout the
British Isles and the continent for
her performance of this kind of
music.

In his appearance, Mr. Yeats will
reminisce on the influence of his
father’s poetry. His wife will pre-
sent musical illustrations of Yeats’
poetry.

One of Ireland’s most distinguish-
ed harpists and singers of tradi-
tional Irish songs, Grainne Yeats
uses a small 31-stringed Irish harp,
a modernized version of the harp
which has been used in Ireland for
over 1,000 years.

A reception will follow the pro-
gram.

Senator and Mrs. Yeats’ visit to
the University is sponsored by the
Friends of the Ellen Clarke Bert-
rand Library, the department of
English, and the English honor
society.

Donald Heiter, a 1946 graduate
ot Lewisburg High School, spent
time in the navy, naval reserve, and
marine corps which included 14
months in Korea and one year in
Vietnam (1967-1968), was appointed
Chief of Police January 4, 1971.

Nodding a ‘Peace, Brother” to
one of his policemen, he noted that
while he might agree with many of
the students ideas, ““You might say
that I don’t have any civil rights, I
have to protect both sides. I’m
going to enforce the law. That's
all there is to it.”

faculty salaries in the Department
of Japanese Studies; and a $5,000
cut from the intercollegiate athletic
program

On the departmental level, only
English, astronomy, and economics
showed any appreciable gains
(more than $1,000), as most showed
slight losses

The ultimate deficit of $68,000
which was uncovered by the new
budget tabulation, was balanced by
using funds which were originally
earmarked for future use
The revision was made with the
hope that the budget would be in
balance. Originally, this action
would not have to occur; however,
due to the slowdown of the economy

i some actions taken during and

er the Cambodian incursion, the
budget was out of balance for the
present fiscal year

In order to avoid the inevitable
Zeller requested last November
that all departments cut their in-
dividual budgets as much as pos-
sible. Dr. Zeller’s office proceeded
to re-evaluate the entire budget in
January, and, on February 10, the

ised budget was sent to Dr.
Charles H. Watts for approval

Although President Watts has
yet to OK the revisions, Dr. Zeller
feels that the budget cuts will stand
as corrected, and, in an interview
with this reporter stated, ‘The
budget has been closed for the
year, and is in balance.”

Dr. Zeller also made some pre-
dictions for next year, in which he
noted that due to the difference in
the sizes of the senior vs. next
year’s freshman class, there will be
an increase of 50 students. This in-
crease taken with the increase in
tuition, will increase income by
$1,000,000, and the total 71-72
budget by close to $750,000.

Also, in regard to the obvious
problem which will accompany the
increase in student population,
Zeller stated that the University

now has an architect commissionec
to supply different poss ities for
future student housing

One of these is the constructor
of privately-owned apartment com
plexes or town house arrangements
while another alternative is cor
struction of University-owned dorms
across Route 15, wh
mural soccer fields are

Overall, however, the f
ng situation seems to be
other financial thorn in Dr

side

‘Pleasing Lack of Pretension’

Sea Train, Kossinec Rate Reviewers’ Raves

By DEAN LANDEW
There are many factors which make a good rock

concert

The first, of course, is a talented group which can do
it technically and with honesty and charisma. Secondly.
a good audience. One which is discriminating, polite
apprecitative, and ready to have a good time.

Then things like reasonable ticket prices and com-

fortable seating come into it.

Well, pleasant surprises are always nice, like good
rock concerts nowadays. And Friday’s Sea Train/Tony
Kossinec concert was a pleasant surprise.

The general atmosphere for the show was right from
the beginning. The usually notorius waiting and push-
ing in line situation would have been almost entirely
eliminated had the sound equipment arrived on time.

Apparently, a lot of people weren’t ready to risk $2
on two unknown acts, so the crowd filled maybe three-
fourths of the gym. It didn’t hurt anything. There was
a pleasing lack of pretentiousness on the performers’
parts and an equally pleasing lack of overexpectation

on the audience’s part.

‘And for $2, the show generally turned out to be one
of the Concert Committee’s best arrangements of the

1970-71 school year.

The headliner, Sea Train, has been kicking around
for a while, switching personnel and recording com-
panies. Three members of the group come from earlier
experiences which a close follower might know: Peter

Rowan, guitar, from Earth Opera;
violin and mandolin, from Jim Kweskin’s Jug Band;
and Andy Kulberg, bass and flute, from the Blues

Project.

Richard Greene,

Sea Train and Tony Kossinec both “withstood” succes
sive standing ovations and proved an “outstanding” be

ginning to the second semester concert series.

Out in the Real World

y DAVID WEINBERGER

I remember last year’s seniors very well, Although I wasn’t there, I
can recall their graduation ceremony. They shook hands with President
Watts, like new-born babies being slapped, and began to wait for their
names to show up in the Alumni News.

In Boston, where most of them went, I slept in their living room one
weekend, hoping to learn from them what my parents couldn’t tell me.
“What's it like in the real world?” I asked when the moment seemed right
The moment stretched and we pretended that I had asked the question as
a joke

One is teaching school. I laughed when I heard about it. Jane’s not a
teacher, although her students don’t know that. Her students call her

Miss,” as they run around the Bunker Hill Monument on the class trip
on Patriot’s Day.

Jane knows that she’s not much of a teacher. The students realize
that they can get away with anything. They aren’t learning anything. Jane
doesn’t even try to justify herself by pretending that she is allowing them
the freedom the archaic school system denies them. The kids are just
running around. But Jane also knows that she is just a temporary teacher.
Somewhere in the future she'll quit and find her rightful place. We both
stopped talking and saw ahead fifteen years. She'll still be teaching but
the kids will call her ‘‘Mrs.” And neither of us will think that it’s a joke
on the school system that she is a teacher.

Another graduated from Bucknell with an art degree. She’s a waitress.
But just for now. She is living in Boston with Jane. She is sleeping on
the couch, looking for a job. A better job for now

They live in a city, but they really live in an apartment with five
other people, each of whom reminds them of someone they knew at
Bucknell. They can’t go for long walks in the country anymore, but they
never did at Bucknell anyway.

Another works for an advertising firm. She’s just doing it to earn
money, making the most of it. She’s not selling out, although she too has
an art degree and is now buying space in newspapers for deodorant adver-
tisements. She is still the same person, disguised in a cloak of averageness
for the sake of the advertising world. In twenty years she'll pause for a
moment in a phone call to the bank and wonder who it is she has hidden
inside

Her boyfriend is in the mailing room, Xeroxing his gentials and send-
ing the copies out as Christmas cards. He’s waiting for his promotion, not
necause he wants to work his way up in advertising, but because then
he’ll have more money to let his real self run free among the unopened

envelopes and the pencils ready to be sharpened.
Sitting in our living room, my friends who have yet to graduate and I

talk about what we will do.

Maybe we'll buy a jeep and drive through South Amearica: python
hunting, fighting off rampaging Amazons, tracking wild boar. But really:

iriving all day through a jungle paved road,

happen like any night in the Bison

waiting for something to

to do without one. Watching as our karma becomes a re-run. The day the

We have friends who are going

to buy a yacht and sail around the

Bucknell’ Dead at 133

By PAUL J. J. PAYACK
and PAUL OSHER
LEWISBURG, Pa., Feb. 23, 1979.
Universitas ‘Bucknell’ Bucknellen-
sis succumbed today after a jong
illness. She was 133 years old and
lived on “the hill” overlooking the
picturesque Susquehanna River.

Mysteriously conceived by “a
small group of Baptists’ in 1845,
the foundation was laid for a short,
but prosperous, lifetime. During
her adolescense and young adult-
hood she was known as the country
club on the Susquehanna who blos-
somed into a favorite social center
(and steppingstone) for white,
Anglo-Saxon protestants in the late
1960’s and early 70's.

In her final years her name was
often associated with the nearby
federal prison. This notoriety reach-
ed its apex during the trial of the
“Harrisburg Six.” This chance se-
quence of events catapulted such
figures as Phil Withim and Zoia
Hern into the national spotlight.

The first noticeable symptons of
the fatal “financial ills’ surfaced
in 1970. (Their cause has not yet
been determined; the coroner’s re-
port will be released on Thursday).

These symptoms manifested them-
selves in a reduction of courses
offered, a smaller scholarship pool,
and a substantial and regular defi-
cit. An exodus of the top-flight fac-
ulty ensued, and the vain attempts
of the administration of Charles
Watts to rectify the situation yield-
ed naught. The University could not
hold onto those who created the
stimulating environment of that
time. Distinguished new professors
were reluctant to join their fading
ranks, even more so as the homo-
geneity of the student body increas-
ed (the institution became a haven
for the upper middle class). An ill-

The stone Bison was converted to
a wishing well as one of the final
efforts to save Miss Bucknellensis.

timed hastily conceived University
Center, ‘‘the little mother,” further
aggreviated the situation.

Near the end, in August of 1972,
one Sid Miller succeeded Charles
Watts as president of the University.
Miller recognized the crisis and
ordered, in the next few years,
several dramatic budget cuts. ROTC
was abolished, football was reduced
to club status and the stone Bison
was converted into a wishing well,
in order to earn its keep.

Immediately before her demise,
Miss Bucknellensis was assimilated
into the Pennsylvania Educational
System, too late, however, to avoid
the inevitable.

Survivors include Philip Roth,
Sam Havrilack, Bob Latour, and a
cast of thousands (also 17,000 bi-
son).

There will be no public viewing.

Gradegrubbers
To the Editor:

Mr. Mates’ letter to the editor
(March 2) revealed an extremely
narrow view of the objectives of a
university and the meaning of dis-
cipline. Bucknell is committed to
intellectual development and bring-
ing the “student to an awareness of
his own talent’ (Bucknell Cata-
logue), not the disciplining of minds.
A “pass system” only means an-
archy for those people who do not
have enough meaning in their own
lives to find fulfillment and self-
integrity. It is the “disciplined ap-
plication of knowledge” without a
humanistic basis that has contri-
buted to the present state of social
problems and has imperiled the ex-
istence of man. Only a new mind (a
Consciousness III?) that has es-
caped the corruption of a disciplined
mentality and the hoax of grade-
grinding can hopefully cope with the
present institutionalized immorality.

Today, education is no more lo-
osely defined—the objectives of at-
taining knowledge, a scholarly ap-
proach and means to cope with life
remain. It is only the methods of
the past that have degenerated that
are being re-evaluated.

In a sense, Mr. Mates is right in
saying that a “disciplined” college
experience will prepare graduates
for later life. Gradegrubbers will
fit into the meritocracy of the cor-
porate state very well. But how
many people want to kiss asses for
the rest of their lives? And he may
be right in saying that the people
who believe in inner-direction, self-
reliance, and self-determination are
in the minority.

Mr. Mates believes that there is
only one kind of discipline—external
and imposed from without. Mr.
Mates, did you ever hear of self-
control, of intrinsic motivation, of
self-determination? It is unfortunate
when so little is left of a human be-
ing that he must rely on artificial
rewards outside of himself to sur-
vive. I do not understand why Mr.
Mates is so concerned with dis-
cipline when the Bucknellian edi-
torial never mentioned the word.
The only place that I have seen the
word ‘discipline’ is in the ROTC
manuals and they certainly have
nothing to do with knowledge.

Anyone desiring rigid control can
enter a military academy or the
demented armed forces. Let those
who desire freedom and self-de-
termination attempt to make the
University into a community of
scholarship.

David Bender

Bears
To the Editor:

Most of us are aware that the
last couple of years have seen a
friendly, helpful, and healthy re-
lationship spring up between the
students and the Campus Security
Force (Bears). The acquisition of
new, young men on the force has
helped to create a rapport with the
Bears which can only enhance their
ability and willingness to protect the
students and University property
while allowing the most reasonable
and pleasant flexibility of Uni-
versity regulations.

More than one example can be
given in which the Bears, perceiv-
ing no danger or destruction, but
only friendly, mischevious actions,
have turned their backs and allowed
pranks and practical jokes to be
perpetrated on a student by his
fellows. It is common knowledge
that the Bears have, upon occasion,
played their own tricks upon stu-
dents and even other Bears. How-
ever, this last point may be their
downfall, unless we as students and
interested individuals move en
masse to waylay the new policy of
the administration.

On March 2, 1971, certain of the
off-duty Bears effected the kidnapp-
ing of a resident on campus. Three
things should be made clear about
the kidnapping: it was done entirely
in fun; no one was hurt and any in
convenience involved was minimal;
and the victim bears no grudge
against the kidnappers. Unfortunate-
ly, the administration apparently
does begrudge the Bears their
harmless fun.

Chief Fine, in this case, apparent-
ly the spokesman for the adminis-
tration, called the men involved on
the carpet. They were told that

their friendship with the students
would have to cease to the extent
that all conversation between stu-
dents and the Bears is to be either
official or non-existent. They are
no longer to be on a first name
basis with students, nor can they
profer a ride up the hill when they
see a student walking along and
fighting the elements on cold, dark,
and miserable nights. In short, the
Bears are to assume a formal and
indifferent attitude towards the stu-
dents, neither offering help and
friendship, nor requesting and re-
ceiving them.

Their official appearance is to be
so altered, that their badges must
be displayed at all times, as well
as this, the immediate institution of
the practice of carrying, at all
time, a nightstick and a canister of
gas has been effected. In other
words, the Bears are to become the
guards at Buckingham Palace, the
MP.’s in a riot control squad to
maintain strict law and order and
to hamper or totally restrict the
normal outlets of student exuber-
ance and comradery as well as
their own. And possibly the ultimate
indignation is that Chief Fine’s re-
strictions extend to their private
lives: the Bears may be told not to
visit Lewisburg bars in order to
avoid possible interaction with stu-
dents.

OK students! You are now aware
ot the situation. The student-Bears
relationship is being seriously

ditor

RN ES
threatened by people who are not
involved and have no apparent
knowledge of its nature or pro-
ductiveness. What do you intend to
do about it? It is to your benefit to
take some action, possibly in form
of letters to the editor of The Buck-
nellian, letters to Chief Fine, Vice
President Zeller, and the like, or
personal visits to these people in
order to preserve the status quo.

Those of you who have contact
with the Bears know this is neces-
sary. To those of you who don’t, ask
around. Find out how many times
a Bear has been hurt helping stu-
dents. Find out’ how many times
the Bears have apprehended
troublemakers and criminals who
have decided to prowl our campus.
You might even discover how many
times the Bears have helped drunk-
en students to get home safely, and
the way in which they have taken
care of people on bum trips, seek-
ing only to help them, calm them
down, and protect them from self-
injury without harsh, police-like
actions.

You'll discover that the Bears go
out of their way to help the stu-
dents, not because their job dictates
it, but simply because they are
your friends, regardless of whether
or not they have ever set eyes on
you before. Their friendship is an
asset to Bucknell life: don’t let it
be foolishly destroyed and the Bears
dehumanized. DO SOMETHING!!

KEEPING ACCOUNT
Administrators’ Chat

By CHARLES MUSSMAN

I wasn’t quite sure who I was listening to at the other end of the bug
which had been cleverly imbedded somewhere on the second floor of Marts
Hall, but the discussion was so interesting that I thought it might be
worth repeating.

As far as I can tell, there were four people present: someone named
Big Flo, another called The Chief, still another addressed as Thomas J.,
and the last called MaryJane. The conversation concerned itself with
occupational hazzards.

Big Flo started off by telling a story of how, just that morning, she
had to go to the dispensary to see someone named Dingaling. It seemed
that a student had tried to bite her after he was told that the drop-and-
add period had ended Although she had been able to get the hysterical
student away from her with a few, well-placed kicks, he was able to in-
flict several nasty scratches on her left leg.

MaryJane followed this by asserting that the female students could
sometimes be worse than the men. She said that she was forced to give
in to a pretty coed, because the wayward girl threatened to expose the
woman’s connection with those “referral” ads in The Bucknellian if she
didn’t give the girl special permission to obtain birth-control pills with-
out her parents’ signatures.

Thomas J. replied to this by saying that MaryJane was lucky that the
girl hadn’t wanted a piece of the action. Then he launched into an account
of his most recent campaign. During his efforts to discourage drug abuse
around campus, he was informed that several students were financing
their education by certain activities in this area. He was SO impressed
by the ingenuity and ambitiousness of these students that he decided to
write a letter to The New York Times citing this example of the way the
youth ‘of America have embraced the free enterprise system.

The Chief congratulated him on the effectiveness of his campaign. He
warned however, that there were other reasons for being extra vigilant in
the coming semester. He was especially concerned about the clamour of
students for open dorms. As evidence for his contintion, he produced a re-
solution from the Audacious Bull-Shitters urging the President to declare
dorm autonomy.

He continued by voicing the opinion that students today are given too
much freedom. In his day, he said, the women’s dormatories were sur-
rounded by a high fence. Men were allowed inside, and every time a
girl left the compound she had to be chaperoned. Ah, those were the days!

The conversation was coming to an end. Someone shouted: ‘In loco
parentis forever!” There was the sound of a window being opened, and
after the chapel bells struck five-thirty, everyone joined in to sing Dear
Bucknell.

Sea Train Concert

(Continued from Page 1)

With organist Lloyd Baskin and
drummer Atamanuik, Sea Train is
one of the strangest looking outfits
in some time (and with the name of
a van lines company, no less). But
after much shuffling around, they
seem to have hit on a winning
musical combination which, hope-
fully, will gain momentum without
getting out of hand.

Technically, this is a good group.
Kulberg and Greene are outstanding
soloists. Greene, in particular, gave
the best single instrumental per-
formance of any non-classical artist
to appear here since Miles Davis
last September as far as I am con-
cerned.

The group’s vocals are solid, and
Atamanuik holds things together
completely on drums, although his
drum solo in “Flute Thing” was. . .
another drum solo.

Although the group has been com-
pared to the Band for reasons which
I find vague, Sea Train has a far
more liberal approach which will
probably suit them well as they try
to make an impression on the larg-
est amount of listeners.

I saw Sea Train about a year ago,
and I still enjoyed the group’s show.
I have been a Richard Greene fan
for a few years now, and I have
been hearing Rowan and Kulberg
for a while, to. The group itself
came across with feeling and, for
a change from most groups, seemed
to like performing.

Two minor complaints. I had
hoped that Rowan’s theatrical days
of political psychedelia with Earth
Opera were behind him, but he
seems to have a new religious a-
version (Elijah, Job, Satan, etc.).
Nothing too wrong with it, but he
can offer so much more otherwise
without being dominated by phases.

Then, I also hope that Sea Train
doesn’t get too indulgent and be-
come the Richard Greene Violin
Showcase, because the whole group
is fine enough to make it without
exploiting his virtuosity solely.

So in the future, it’s a question of
Sea Train getting a chance to be
heard. They can give a good show,
and I hope they can keep up with
good material and get somewhere
this time.

As for Tony Kossinec, he seemed |

surprised. He received two stand-

ing ovations, sort of an impressive |

thing considering he was a virtual
unknown when he took the stage.
And a one night engagement in
Vaughan Lit. Auditorium to boot.
His acoustic guitar /bass/piano
set-up may have reminded some of
James Taylor, but Tony is quite
different. His songs are not the
typical 4-line verse and chorus with
ABAB lyrical form. He presents a
semi-steram of conscious ness thing,
and he is a good singer, flashing

moments of a very impressive voice
range. He also has a foxy piano
player.

I guess what I liked best about
him was his very last line before
he walked off initally: ‘‘ We do, we
do, we do make music.”

One last aside to think about. The
University seems to be suffering
from an Encore Syndrome. What is
it about every pop act that steps
onto the magical makeshift Davis
Gym stage that instills them with
such incredible and predictable
crowd-moving powers? I mean
every one gets the Standing O. But
then, it’s up to you... . it depends
how culture-starved you are.

All right, tossing aside value judg-
ments, I can’t complain. Both acts
were good. I dug the concert. Every-
body involved seemed to come off
looking really good this time

around.

riculum in which students take only
one course in place of the usual

It is Unsoeld’s conviction that ed-
ucation is more easily gained out-
side the formal classroom structure.
For example, his students spent the
initial two weeks of the past se-
mester hiking and camping in the
wilderness.

There will be an overnight dissus-

be extensive discussion and criti-
cism of ‘“‘the Unsoeld educational

expedition.

At seven o’clock Monday night in
New Dorm Pit, Unsoeld will hold a
fireside discussion of his educational
ideas. All interested members of
the University community are in-
vited to attend.

The class received an information
letter from the regional head-
quarters, with a personal sketch
about the 14-year-son, Ronnie, and
his family. The class then sent a
letter to the family. No response
came.

“Tt was then that we started to
get discouraged,” Sengstack said.
“There was no communication from
either SCF or the family indicating
that the money was being used.”

After sending several letters to
SCF requesting information, the
class received a notice that the

the Black’s business was reported
not to have improved, though the

lack of concern or follow-up on the

cated to reclaiming the MAC title,
became a glorious success last

by placing 1-3 in the 200 butterfly.
A surprising finalist, Bucknell’s
Gary Norton, placed fourth with a
fine time of 2:10.2. O’Keeffe’s crush-
ing victory and Huffman’s sixth
place finish in the 20 free brought
the Bisons to within three points.

Then Winings, Slick, and Wilf
placed 1-4-5 in the 100 breast, and
the Bisons moved into the lead.

The backstroke trio placed 2-5-6 in
the 100 back, and the divers (Bob
Richards and Ron Farr) served
the cause by eliminating Lehigh’s
Tom Dillman from the finals of the
i-meter event, and placing fifth and
sixth themselves.

Bob Rasmussen then set a school
record (4:35.5) in the 400 IM, plac-
ing second for the second year in

The 800 freestyle relay, however,
was the turning point of the meet.

Last year the disqualification of
this relay cost the Bisons ten
points, and placed them 21 points
behind Lehigh going into Saturday’s
events. This time, however, O’Keef-
fe’s magnificent anchor leg won the
event, and the Engineers weak

of the 10 butterfly then cut the lead
to 25.

Bob Richards placed third in the
3-meter diving and Ron Farr placed
fifth.

The final event of the meet was
the 400 frestyle relay, and as Paul
Landes later stated, “their was no
way we were going to lose that re-
lay.”

From the firing of the gun Win-
ings (48.5) was in the lead, and
Krohmer (49.5) and Landes (48.5)
increased it further. When O’Keef-
fee entered the water he had a
huge lead, and his blazing finish
(47.0) completed a new school,
pool, and MAC record of 3:13..6.

A beaming Dick Russell accepted
the championship plaque but was
unable to comment because his
voice was hoarse from three days
of cheering. He quickly handed it
back, however, as the team threw
him and diving coach Ronn Jenkins
in the pool. His year of striving for
perfection is over and the MAC
championship is back at Bucknell
where it belongs.

fourth place finished placed them |

those same 21 points behind, the Bi-
sons, 84-63.

On Saturday the Bisons quickly
broke the meet wide open, as Huff-
man and Gary Norton swept the

1650, and the 21 point Bison lead |

became 33.

O’Keeffe and Krohmer place d 1-
5 in the 100 free, and the back-
stroke trio’s 4-5-6 finish in the 20
back increased the margin to 40.

The 200 breastroke was the great- |

est head-to-head confrontation of
the meet, as the Bisons qualified
their trio of Rasmussen, Wilf, and
Slick, and Lehigh qualified their
freshman aces, Charles O’Loughlin
and Jim Stine.

closely followed by Rasmussen (2:

In response to President Charles

the ABS has decided to hold a

the matter. The forum, to be held

Questions Institutional Goals

Provost Examines Education’s Dilemma

“Some of the problems we face,
as well as other small colleges, are
that we are too small to be success-
ful, do not offer as comprehensive
a program, and are enrolling a de-
creasing proportion of the popula-
tion as time goes on,” said Dr.
Wendell I. Smith, University Pro-
vost.

His lecture, entitled “Will the
Private University Survive’ is the
third in a series of C.A. sponsored
lectures about education. Smith pro-

vided another view of the supposed
failing private residential institu-
tion

As provost, Dr. Smith is largely
connected with the problems facing
the University as well as its faculty.
Dr. Smith’s discussion mainly con-
cerned the University, or as some
may call it, the University’s demise
regarding its educational effective-
ness. Another important problem he
mentioned was the duplication in
college of both secondary school

“Distinguished Third World Speakers
Lecture on Socioeconomic Problems

By CAROLYN PERNICE

One of the highlights of the Third
World week-end will be the scores of
visiting professors and guest speak-
ers who will be coming to talk
about the under-developed countries
of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Four of these visiting lecturers
will be Stanley D. Metzger, Ralph
Zacklin, Edisson Osorio, and John
Herbert Badgley.

Metzger, presently a professor of
law at Georgetown University Law
Center, will speak on his concern
with economic problems of develop-
ment.

He hopes that his ‘‘interests and
work have been toward trade and
aid with under-developed countries,
looking toward their accelerated

# economic development and effective
political independence.”

In his role as assistant legal ad-
visor for the State Department from
1946-60, he served as advisor to the
U.S. delegation which established
the Inter-American Development
Bank in 1959. He also served on the

University

By JACK SCHMIDT

President Charles Watts has re-
ceived a letter from the Project on
Corporate Responsibility, request-
ing his support in Campaign GM-

* Round II, an effort to make
American corporations more re-
sponsive to society's needs.

In an interview with the Bucknel-
lian on March 9, Watts commented
on (what the project has termed),
an attempt to “give the university
and other General Motors share-
holders a continuing opportunity to
exercise their responsibilities of
ownership.”

The University presently has
6,869 shares in GM worth over half
a million dollars. However, this
represents a relatively minor per-

tablish the International Develop-
ment Association

In addition to serving as con-
sultant for the agencies of the State
Department, Metzger is presently
an honorary member of the Mexican
Academy of Law and Culture and a
member of the American Society
for International Law.

He has also published a book,
Trade Between ‘Have’ and ‘Have-
Not’ Countries and served as author
of UNCTAD, the American Journal
of International Law.

Zacklin is from the Rutgers Uni-
versity School of Law in Newark,
New Jersey where he teaches public
international law.

He is particularly concerned with
the role of the international com-
munity, as represented by the
United Nations, in the affairs of the
underdeveloped nations of Africa,
Asia and South America.

Concerning this topic, he has
written several books of which he
is best known for The Amendment
oi the Constitutive Instruments of

centage of the total GM shares.

Earlier in the year, Watts travel-
ed to Detroit to talk with GM of-
ficials about GM’s response to
“social issues.”” He said his trip had
been “‘very interesting’ and that he
had found real evidences that GM
was taking the issues of social re-
sponsibility very seriously.”

Watts said he could receive no
clear answers from GM on what
Watts called fundamental issues —
how does a private corporation ex-
press its sense of social responsi-
bility?

Specifically, the Project is asking
the universities to vote their GM
stock in favor of three new share-
holder resolutions that the Project
will introduce at GM’s annual meet-

and graduate school courses. The
University could be cited however,
as having less duplication than most
other colleges.

Assuming that the University will
remain a private institution, that
its financial base and status will be
secure, and that the private resi-
dential college retains its place in
society, Smith questioned the goals
of this institution.

He stated “the institution should
become a center for experimenta-
tion” and a place where goals de-
veloped by the students themselves
“are visible.”

“Older people are unable to ac-
cept change’ was a statement by
Dr. Smith directed towards the fac-
ulty.

He continued, ‘Learning to live
with change is absolutely necessary,
but we should not institutionalize
each change as if next year it were
tradition.”

Smith stressed, ‘We should com-
mit ourselves to be heterogeneous,
as an institution not insuring
elitism.”

“The ability to pay’’ should not
be so vital in attempting to provide
the University with a more diverse
student body.’’ However, he con-
tinued, ‘‘this will necessitate more
status support.”

The provost presented some ideas
he felt would benefit the University
as a place of higher learning.

“Bucknell’s degree program is
too restrictive,’ he said, “because
degrees had to be completed within
a certain period of time.”

“A three-year program would
benefit students with little or no
direction, while a longer program
might be more suitable for other
individuals,” he said.

He also suggested that orienta-
tion, credit for work outside of

ing on May 21 in Detroit. Campaign
GM has said that if the proposals
pass, they “would have a funda-
mental impact on GM’s decision-
making process.

Last year, the University’s stocks
were voted with management, but
a letter was sent to GM by Watts,
expressing concern that GM make
itself more responsive to social
pressure.

In a Bucknellian interview with
John Zeller, Vice-President of Ad-
ministration and Finance, Zeller
commented that he expected no
administrator of the University to
present the case for Campaign GM
to the trustees.

Trustees Must Decide
The executive committee of the

a graduating senior each spring to
serve a term of three years. Even-
tually three recent graduates will be
on the Board.

“J wasn’t at all surprised, but I
was disappointed,’ commented Bob
Nachshin concerning President
Watt’s letter. Nachshin suggested
these possible courses of action for
the ABS to take involving dorm and
fraternity regulations:

1. To encourage the living units
to declare themselves autonomous;

2. To wait until the results of a
questionnaire concerning this come
in and then go to the President with
an ABS recommendation. If the
President does not approve it, dorm
autonomy can then be called for or
no action can be taken;

3. To wait for the results of the
questionnaire and then abide by
them;

4. To call for the question of 24
hour dorms to be decided and acted
upon individually.

In February, the ABS had passed
a motion calling for the President
to grant dorm autonomy until such
time as the regulations governing

visitation and co-ed facilities could
be lifted

In his reply to this, Watts asked
that the ABS wait for the Student
Affairs Committee questionnaire to
be tabulated and evaluated. He
stated that if the recommendations
which would be made to him by
April 12 were extremely encourag-
ing, he would be prompted to look
into it. This could take a consider-
able amount of time

There is a possible misunderstand-
ing or contradiction as to the origin-
al use of the questionnaire and the
referendum’ that President Watts
termed it to be. Several ABS mem-
bers doubted that the students knew
how important the questionnaire
may become

ABS members attended confer-
ences in Chicago and at Penn State
last weekend, involving student gov-
ernment, younger trustees, and lob-
bying in Harrisburg for funds for
Pennsylvanian colleges and universi-
ties. Individuals interested in a
meeting to organize lobbying for

Assembly Appropriates Money
For Delinquent University Aid

By ROBERT BITTERLICH

John Hayward, Director of Fi-
nancial Aid expressed his opinion
that students who have been threat-
ened by the loss of PHEAA student
aid can “stop worrying.’ What
prompted this optimism was a letter
from Pennsylvania’s Governor
Milton Shapp.

Shapp reports that he has just
signed ‘‘a bill passed by the General
Assembly of the Commonwealth
which includes a three and one half
percent personal income tax for
residents of the Commonwealth.”

The funds received through this
tax will enable the State to pay it’s
debts to the Universities as well as
to operate the State government
until June 1972.

At this point, the legislation has
been passed by the Senate 44-2, and
is being prepared for action in the
House of Representatives. The Gov-
ernor reports that the act has his
full support

If this act is passed, Shapp
promises ‘that the PHEAA will be
in a position to distribute funds to
your institution as soon as legisla-
tion can be enacted appropriating
the money, and payments can be
processed.

Mr. Hayward sees the purpose of
the letter as two-fold. Initially, the
Governor wishes to publicize his
actions and opinions on this issue
and, secondly, he wants to reassure
Universities and students that funds

Campaign

trustees will be meeting in New
York in about one month for a
regular meeting. If the University
is to change its vote from support
of management, the decision has to
be made at this time.

Watts said, in the interview, that
he was obligated to report to the
trustees on his trip to Detroit. Dur-
ing the report, he thought it entire-
ly possible that he might mention
Campaign GM. However, he also
seemed reluctant to press strongly
for trustee action in support of the
Project.

Watts said he is concerned with
the “large sources of power” in the
country, and the possibility that
corporations may someday “‘overt-
ly” establish the values of the so-

will be forthcoming

Many schools had set April 15 as
the d ine for the state to pay
and then they would demand the
students to pay the balance due
themselves.

Although our University has set
no deadline, they do suffer the loss
of interest the money could be earn-
ing this semester

Although the Office of Business
and Finance will have to work
around this deficit, he feels sure the
cash will be received soon enough
to avoid any permanent damage

NYC Theatre Group

“Terminal,” the latest work of
Open Theatre, an experimental
theatre group from New York City,
will be presented at the University

The Open Theatre began 8 years

The Proposals

The first Campaign GM proposal
would transform the now closed
selection of directors into a real
election simply by requiring GM to
list on its proxy candidates nomin-
ated by shareholder petitions; only
candidates nominated by manage-
ment are listed there now. All share-
holders thus would have the op-
portunity to make meaningful nomi-
nations and to choose among op-
posing nominees

The second proposal would give
three of GM’s most important con-
stituencies — consumers, dealers,
and employees — a voice in GM’s

A Time for Openness

The Provost has approved Profes-
sor Richard Drinnon’s recommendation
that Professor Mortimer Cushman’s con-
tract not be renewed. There is consider-
able doubt in the minds of many mem-
bers of the academic community con-
cerning the underlying reasons for this
dismissal. The time has come for com-
plete disclosure of all facts concerning
the matter.

Drinnon has provided this rationale
for his actions st, the quality of his-
tory taught by Cushman, exemplified in
his doctoral thesis, is not acceptable ;
second, Cushman is not sufficiently con-
cerned with students’ problems; and
third, his contributions to and coopera-
tion in the work of the department have
not been adequate. Drinnon has restated
these points time and again.

During the first part of this se-
mester, a letter was printed in The Buck-
nellian on behalf of 80 per cent of

With all the changes and experiments which the Army has under-

taken, there are other key ingredients, over which the Army can exercise

minimal control, that will be needed in any plan to reach a zero

draft. Among other things these involve public attitudes about the military

é appropriation by Congress of the additional money which

» of the items that will require substantial appropriation if

ike military service competitive with civilian life for the

high-type young people our Services require. For example, it is estimated

that civilianizing kitchen police would cost about $115 million a year. To

give our soldiers increased privacy in their barracks is estimated to cost

at least $50 million. Young people do not contend with these irritations in
civilian pursuits.

One of the reasons we feel so strongly about the extension of Selective
Service is our apprehension that it will take a considerable period of
time before appropriations of the size required will be passed by Congress.
While there is a great reservoir of esteem and good will for the Services
in Congress, there are in its membership many vocal anti-militarists.
There is also amongst those in Congress who are friendly to the military
Services, an openly expressed cynicism or doubt about the efficacy or
practicability of an All-Vounteer Force. In this climate our visualization of
a gradual, long-term effort to reach the goal of zero draft seems to be
realistic

There is another basic problem which cannot be solved by the Services
alone, and that is the attitude of many Americans, particularly the young,
toward military Service. Public esteem for our Armed Services has reached
a low ebb. Hopefully, some of the program now underway in the Services
will improve matters. Probably the further wind-down of the war in Viet-
nam will moderate some of the virulence which has been so unjustly di-

I appreciated very much your

it hard to understand the attitude
of those who aspire us to interna-

that their personal international ex-

To demand that a foreigner com-

‘o the Editor
Mr. deBenedictis (Bucknel-
lian, March 5) shares a common
misperception about the purpose of
grades. It is perhaps true that for
some students the grade is an end
in itself, a spur without which they
would do nothing. For such stu-
dents the grade is a useful tool,
although it can become a crutch.
But this is not the primary pur-
pose of grades. For those who feel
the need to excell, to actualize the
potential that is in them, the grade
is simply a convenient means of
keeping score, a rough measure of
progress. Such students would do
well with or without grades. In
psychological terms, the distinction
is between students motivated by
the ‘need for achievement’? and
those driven by a “fear of failure.”
Mr. deBenedictis also spoke of the
purpose of the University he asked

whether we are here ‘‘just for the

in communication. Nowhere in my
article did I limit the applicability
of my comments to material ven-
tures: the tenor of my article was
that any venture in life requires
habits of discipline, with which I
am sure Mr. deBenedictis would
agree.

Furthermore, I do not see the
validity of the purported distinction
between learning “just for the sake
of learning” and learning as a prep-
aration for life. In a meaningful
education the two go hand in hand.
Mr. deBenedictis simply assumes

Concert Forum
To the Editor:

Monday, March 8, an open forum
was held by the Concert Committee
in Coleman 101-A. The response of
the “concerned students’ of the
Bucknell Community was quite sur-
prising. . . . The number of students
that attended the meeting was
matched by the number of Concert
Committee members present.

Comments, criticisms, and sug-
gestions were solicited by the Com-
mittee from those present, but due
to the poor attendance the entire
proceedings took less than half an
hour. During the course of the dis-
cussion, it was suggested by a
member of the Committee that an-
other forum be held soon after
spring break.

As one of the few present at the
Concert Committee’s first forum, I
sincerely hope that those “con-
cerned students’? whom we have
heard from will take the time to
come down of their soapboxes,
whether public or private, and at-
tend the next meeting. They may
jearn something.

rected at the military. But others outside the Services are going to have
to help.

We urge that the Commander-in-Chief take a more active role using
the full machinery of his administration to enhance the prestige of the
Services. Congress can, of course, do a great deal not only through their
appropriations, but by more actively and publicly refuting the garrulous
minority who feel that there is political capital to be made by vilifying
the military who cannot fight back. Leaders in business and industry can
take a more active, positive and public posture in support of the military.

But most of all, many members of the religious and academic com-
munities have the greatest responsibility to make restitution for the damage
which they have done to the dedicated individuals who through their mili-
tary Service have shouldered the burdens of executing our national policy
while they had no voice in its direction. The anti-military activities of

large numbers among the religious and academic communities have been
a national scandal and have seriously demeaned their own institutions as
well as doing grave injustice to those who serve their country as good
citizens. We cannot have the All-Volunteer Force they profess to desire
so passionately if they at the same time do all they can to discredit and
vilify those who wear the uniform.

If those who so ardently oppose Selective Service will channel a
portion of their energies toward making military Service more prestigious
and attractive, the day may come when the draft will no longer be needed.
Until then, we Americans can’t have it both ways. We can’t insist that
Selective Service must be abolished and fail to support those measures
needed to create a Modern Volunteer Army. American colleges can’t pro-
test their love of freedom and permit a radical minority on campus to de-
prive others of the freedom to choose a military profession through ROTC.
And American citizens, for whose security the military serves, cannot
fail to insist that military personnel be treated with decency, dignity and
respect throughout our society.

Involuntary military service has never been popular since its instiga-
tion in 1792. However, without it our country would have been lost.‘ Much
is being done to make military service less onerous, but such involuntary
service through a viable, operative Selective Service System will be re-
quired until we have proven that we can maintain quality Armed Forces of
sufficient size to meet our National Security requirements without it.

Pass - Fail
To the Editor:

Tt is often the case that ostensibly
local or specialized issues turn out
on close examination to be mani-
festations of larger universal ques-
tions. This, I believe, is the case
concerning the question of whether
Bucknell or any university should
judge its students on a five letter
scale or on a pass-fail basis. The
grading system in high schools and
colleges is part of a larger system
of competition that is generally ac-
cepted as a central motivational
force in our society. Whether in
sports, war, business social climb-
ing or grade-grabbing, as it stands
now competition entails winning and
losing.

Admittedly we have produced an
efficiency and affluency in which
there are enough ‘‘winners’ to
maintain a steady stream of self-
proclamations of being “the great-
est nation on earth’ (paraphrased
from off the side of a circus wagon).
Perhaps if we were to suspend this
lullaby for a moment, it would be-
come apparent to all that this nation
rests on a disturbingly extensive
base of victims—both foreign and
domestic

It may be impossible for us as a
nation to deal humanely with our
prisoners, insane, addicts and al-
coholies, for to do so might well
require an admission that we are
hiding as many weaknesses of the
“free enterprise’ system as we are
touting strengths of it. At present
we are attending a surface defect—
the fact that at no level of society
is the competition fair. Individual
physical characteristics, political
beliefs, religion, social background,
national origin, sex and skin color
are all decisive factors in determin-
ing success at any level of society
(including the classroom). But this
is merely a superficial fault. Long-
standing governmental neglect of
problems of the mentally ill, socially
ill, drug addiction, alcoholism
would seem to reveal a deeper
dread—perhaps a fear or admitting
the system itself is at fault.

0 the Editor

a

The results of living in a world of
high pressured competition with the
fear of losing face or one’s position,
plus a confused system of rewards
are evident throughout western
civilization. Bribery, cheating and
sycophancy are encouraged by the
system. Competition promotes di-
visiveness, pits man against man,
business against business, group
against group with the “winners”
demoralizing or destroying their
“foes.” One is faced with surrender-
ing either his victories or his con-
science, for neither pride nor shame
are morally or psychologically pro-
ductive and fear is a poor force in
deed to motivate human beings.

Compulsory competition implies a
need to justify one’s existence to
his age or worse, to that society
arbitrarily imposed upon him by
birth. Since neither the age nor the
society can provide or guarantee
existential fulfillment, the presump-
tion of an obligation for self-justifica-
tion becomes strained at best. In-
deed the society should be one in
which we are encouraged to enrich
and expand our modes of existence
rather than to waste time justifying
the Given.

For these reasons it would appear

=
that the University would serve it-
self and society as a whole well by
seeking alternative motivational sys-
tems at least for academic en-
deavors. We should continue to re-
organize those as of the Uni-
versity which promote or presume
competition in their teaching to the
exclusion of other systems. But first
d foremost we should reduce the
pressures of academic competition
so as to allow the development of
alternative motivational forces.

Presently, Zacklin is the director
of the International Law Program
at the Carnegie Endowment for In-
ternational Peace.

This organization seeks practical
paths to peace and its publications
deal with programs in international
law, diplomacy, the changing role
of military force and the advance-
ment of international relations re-
search.

In addition, he is contributing his
time to the Carnegie-sponsored In-
ter-American Study Group.

This group is doing research on
the law of the sea and international
economic law within the context of
Latin America, and is also under-
taking a second project on inter-
national aid and legal development
in which the role and function of
law in development is being studied.

Experience is the key clause ina
description of Osorio. He spent five
years as a Lutheran minister in
Chile, Ecuador and Puerto Rico,
served as Secretary of the Student
Ch ian Movement for one year
in Ecuador, and acted as Regional
‘ etary of the Latin American
Union of Ecumenical Youth for
three years in the Caribbean Area.

John Carlson co-ordinator of the
week-end feels that Osorio ‘will be

able to present the views of the
people since he has worked on the
problems of the area on a grass-
roots level.”

In addition, "he should be able to
give to us Americans, an insight
into our government policies and
performances in South America,”
since he was born here and lived
most of his life in the United States.

About Badgley, Carlson comment-
ed, “John Badgley is primarily con-
cerned with the political aspects of
development: the problems involv-
ed in creating change and progress
through the existing governmental
structures.”

As an author, he has written
several books and a countless num-
ber of articles and professional
papers on Southeast Asia, especial-
ly Burma

Consequently, Carlson feels that
“he should be able to give insights
into the national feelings of the
people in these countries, the in-
fluence of Communist China in the
area, and nation-building and de-
velopment in an area of conflict.”

Presently, Badgley is teaching
at John Hopkins University, SAIS,
and is also on the Board of Di-
rectors for the Association for
Asian Studies, the Advisory Board
of the Asian Literature Program,
and the Board. of Editors of the
Asian Survey.

ing them to participate in the se-
lection of three GM directors.

The third proposal would require
GM to publish in its annual report
hard statistics on its progress on
auto-pollution control, auto-safety,
and minority hiring, thereby provid-
ing shareholders, constituents, and
the public with the minimum infor-
mation needed to effectively evalu-
ate whether GM is meeting its
public responsibilities.

The Project, a public interest
center in Washington, D.C. believes
giant corporations, epitomized by
General Motors, are virtually pri-
vate governments; their decisions
fundamentally affect the lives of
millions of people in areas ranging
from product safety to employment
discrimination to environmental pol-
lution. ‘“‘Yet those decisions are
made, far removed from public
view, by a narrow group of self-
chosen men — isolated from the
people their decisions affect and in-
sulated from the public pressures
that shape the decisions of society’s
other important policymakers.” The
Project, through Campaign GM and
its other activities, seeks to subject
corporate decisions to public scru-
tiny and to make corporate decision-

makers directly accountable to the
people affected by corporate action.

Campus Focus

In campaigning for the Campaign
GM proposals, the Project is con-
centrating on institutions, such as
universities, foundations, union pen-
sion funds, banks, mutual funds,
churches, and insurance companies
(who together own over 40% of
GM's stock), urging them to make
use of their power as major share-
holders in GM to make GM more
responsive to public needs.

The Project also plans to cam-
paign among the constituents of
those institutions — church mem-
bers, university students, teachers,
and alumni, bank depositors, mu-
tual fund investors, insurance policy
holders, union members — urging
them to insist on their institution’s
support. A major goal of Round II
is to crack what it sees as an un-
spoken alliance between corporate
management and institutional lead-
ership “that has for too long per-
mitted management the luxury of
making decisions without challenge
and policies without review.”

The Project is particularly focus-
ing on universities, for it believes
that they have a special obligation
to consider the social as well as

vote on Campaign GM is “re-
sponsive to the wishes of the entire

dents are organizing referendums;
others are planning debates and

through special committees that
have been set up to reevaluate the
university’s investment policies.
Last Year

Last year, when this University
supported management, the Project
campaigned for a proposal to add
three public interest directors to the
GM Board and a proposal to estab-
lish a Shareholder Committee on
Corporate Responsibility to review
GM’s public policies. As a result of
that campaign, many people for the
first time began to corsider the
social impact of corporate decisions.
The campaign precipitated intensive
debates within shareholding insti-
tutions, leading many to reassess
their investment criteria. It at-
tracted considerable public and
shareholder support, including the
votes of several universities.

Features Editor’s Note: ‘Spotlight’
is a new feature which will give
brief summaries of campus and
area entertainments for the week-
end and the coming week.

Les Cousins is Hilltop’s feature
presentation tonight at 8:00 p.m. in
Vaughan Literature Auditorium.
Claude Chabrol’s 1970 film depicts
the relationship of Paul and Charles,
law students and cousins, who share
a Paris apartment in the last year
of their study.

Charles, the hard-working and
sensitive country boy, and his super-
ficial and decadent cousin are con-
trasted in their daily experiences,
and in their relationship with a
sweetly pretty girl who responds
physically to the latter but is “in
love’ with the former. As Charles
fails his exams and Paul passes,
the film comes to a shocking and
sobering climax which brings to an
end the odd association.

Saturday Review praised Cha-
brol’s eye and sense for detail as
“extraordinary.” Catching the at-
titudes of the young without being
satirical, Chabrol’s talent and the
fine acting of Jean-Claude Brialy,
Gerard Blain, and Juliet Mayniel
makes Les Cousins a film worth
seeing

Tonight at 8:30 p.m. and tomor-
row at 2:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., Cap
and Dagger will continue their per-
formance of The Trojan Women in
Coleman Hall. Jean-Paul Sartre's
adaptation of Euripides’ tragedy is
set in Troy, the day after the close
of the ten year Trojan War. The
women of the city, reflecting upon
their fallen culture and their im-
minent fate, express the futility and
brutality of their war, and all wars.
The production is directed by Dr.
Harvey Powers and tickets can be
obtained at the Bookstore, with a
one dollar discount upon presenta-
tion of a University ID.

At Lewisburg’s Campus theatre,
Five Easy Pieces will be presented
this weekend. The highly-praised

film presents a series of incidents
in the life of Robert Eroica Dupea
(Jack Nicholson)-moments of anger,
comedy, nostalgia, and passing sad-
ness-that help to reveal his complex
personality.

Journeying into the past to visit
his family at the oppressive home
he once fled, he travels across class
lines to a tight, repressed, intellec-
tual world consisting of meaningless
chat and piano duets—a direct con-
trast from his thoughtless and vio-
lent everyday life as a beer-drink-
ing, bowling, bawdy oil-rigger.

The portraits of Robert, losing
himself in the lives of common
laborers, Rayette (Karen Black),
the waitress he gets involved with,
and the several minor characters
he meets, including the ecology-
minded lesbian hitch-hikers, make
Five Easy Pieces undoubtedly one
of the best films of the year.

The Strand Theatre in Sunbury
will present this weekend The World
of Hans Christian Anderson, an ani-
mated cartoon.

Monday Night at 8:30 p.m., the
Open Theatre will perform Ter-
minal, an experimental drama sim-
ilar in form to the Company’s two
other productions, American Hurrah
and The Serpent.

The group, formed in 1963 by
Joseph Chaikin in New York, pre-
sents a series of improvised images
to deliver the impact of their pur-
pose. Terminal is based on medita-
tions on death, the Last Judgment,
and reincarnation, and “is a con-
spiracy to make death relevant only
to others, never oneself; a con-
spiracy to concede that we all die.”

Tickets for the production are
available at the Bookstore for $2.50.

Eco Group Seeks Environmental Remedies

By KARL BLAKE
Features Editor's Note: This is the

Neiswender is the leader of
American Eco, a small group of

Lewisburg residents who are con-
cerned about the state of the en-
vironment. Most of them are young,
but youth is no criterion for mem-
bership. In fact, the group would
prefer more older members, to
counter what Chip David, the sole
Bucknell student in the group, fears
may be their “freak image.”

The group’s activities include the

second of a series of articles deal-
ing with ecology at the University
and in the Lewisburg area.

“We are primarily concerned with
developing an educational, grass
roots approach to arousing the
public to the deadly seriousness of
the environmental crisis,’ says
Karl Neiswender of the American
Ecology Concern Organization

dissemination of information on en-
vironmental issues, the sale of “en-
vironmentally safe’? cleaning pro-
ducts, recycling paper, promoting
a Ban-the-Can campaign in Lewis-
burg, and organizing an Earth Day
program.
Education

Education is American Eco’s
principal goal. To this end they dis-
tribute mimeographed information
sheets in Lewisburg and nearby
communities, publish a newsletter,
and soon will be maintaining an
“ecology bulletin board” in front of
the Union County Journal offices.

A sample information sheet sug-
gests twenty-five ways in which the
individual can help alleviate en-
vironmental problems. (Example:
“Use less electricity, especially be-
tween the hours of 5 and 7 p.m.
These are prime hours and deter-
mine the needs for more power
plants (possibly nuclear) and more
dirty air, dirty water, and dead
fish.”’)

No charge is made for either the
information sheets or the news-
letter.

Fund-raising Projects

To finance their publications, the
group is engaged in two fund-raising
activities which have the added ad-
vantage of being environmentally
constructive.

The first of these involves selling
a line of ‘environmentally safe’’
detergents, cleaners and cosmetics.
Produced by the Shaklee Company,
these products are completely or-
ganic and biodegradable, contain-
ing no phosphates or manufactured
chemicals of any kind. They are
also nontoxic if accidentally swal-
lowed by children

A second ‘“‘fund-raising” project,
the recycling of paper, has not yet
succeeded in raising any funds.
Eventually, however, this project
should provide a small source of
revenue.

The group also hopes to become
involved in recycling glass. How-
ever, while paper can be con-
veniently recycled through Baker’s
Junk Yard in Lewisburg, which then
sells it to a firm in Williamsport,
the nearest glass recycling facilities
are 120 miles away. The group is
searching, somewhat desperately,
for transportation for this project.

Another American Eco project in
progress is a Ban-the-Can cam-

Peoples Lobby
Desires Change

By DAN MARTIN

L. C. Ball feels that the people
are the only group in the United
States who are unorganized and
thus ineffective in voicing their de-
mands. To remedy this appalling
situation, he has organized a
Peoples Lobby, with the intention
of making known to the government
the wishes of the populous, through
sheer voting power.

Mr. Ball’s seemingly infeasible
plan to obtain fifty million signa-
tures arose from what he considers
to be at the heart of the injustice-
the sixteenth amendment. This par-
agraph which gives the Congress
the “power to lay and collect taxes
on incomes, from whatever sources
derived, without appropriation
among the several States, and with-
out regard to any census or enu-
meration” is, in his opinion, far too
strong. It underlies the American
belief that power comes with money
alone.

By repealing the sixteenth amend-
ment, the power of the government
would be reduced by reducing its
overhead cost of opérating.

Other specific aims of the Lobby
will be formulated at a general
meeting when five thousand signa-
tures are obtained. In existence only
three weeks, the organization now
has five hundred names of inter-
ested voters. There is no member-
ship fee; cards and applications
have been printed up by local firms
at no cost and ten volunteers pre-
sently man the office at 37 Broad-
way, Milton, from 10 a.m. to noon
and 2 to 4 p.m., Monday through
Friday. Mr. Ball will absorb the
cost involved when formal organi-
zation comes about.

Mr. Ball is seeking people who
have grievances as well as those
who have inexpensive solutions. to
those grievances. In addition to re-
lieving some of the ills of the
country, it must be proven that
changes can be made without huge
expenditures.

The Peoples Lobby might take its
motto from Thomas Jefferson, who
said that “if we can prevent the
government from wasting the labors
of the people under the pretense of
caring for them, they will be
happy.”

There is everything to gain from
the Peoples Lobby. As the group
grows, local legislators will feel its
impact; an impact that will spread
eventually to state and national
governments. Without violence or
demonstration, this is a simple
answer to America’s problems, an
answer to which Mr. Ball is giving
his full-time attention:

Lehigh Engineers Glide Past Icers;

By DEAN LANDEW

After all the adrenalin stops pumping, after all the bets have been
paid off, after the mandatory full-color spread in Sports Tilustrated gives
everyone a souvenir, maybe people will see who and what the real win-
ners and losers were in the Muhammand Ali/Joe Frazier word champion-
ship fight.

As for the two fighters, the main thing to remember is: Ali did not
necessarily have to win, but HE COULD NOT LOSE. This does not imply
that Frazier could not win; it is merely a statement on Ali’s over-all role
in the fight.

These are times when words are often substituted for action. Such
seemed to be the case with Ali Monday night. To the dismay of Frazier
fans, or anti-Ali forces at any rate, Frazier’s victory will probably not
serve to “shut that big mouth bastard up.” Ali had won every one of his
professional fights before meeting Frazier, most of them by knockouts.
His place in boxing history was easily secured before he ever entered the
ring.

The words-over-actions idea is a funny thing. You're applauded and
mythologized when you deliver, but shamed when you don’t, But shame
dies quicker than applause when you've already been a hero. It seems
that just as many people, if not more, are rooting for Joe Namath to
make it all the way back to the Super Bowl, even after the great fall he
and the Jets took in 1970.

With Ali, however, the case is slightly different. His career may be
over. Certainly, a rematch with Frazier would be anticlimactic if not
futile. But Ali is such a spectacular figure outside of athletics in so many
parts of the world that he will live on, his fans possibly packing him more,
once the post-mortems are done.

I'd prefer to avoid political connotations, but it does remain to be
seen how Ali will conduct himself. I like to think that much of the sum
he makes after taxes will go to the defense of his draft case, the Black
Muslims in some way, or travel expenses for speaking engagements.

Ali must live up to the fact that he has a claim in the case of Guy
Gillette, a New Yorker who challenged the government the afternoon of
the fight as a conscientious objector. He objects to fighting only in Viet-
nam; a CO must object to all wars. The Supreme Court turned him down
He faces a two year jail sentence.

So Ali will not lose if he is what his fans hope he is, a fighter in more
than one way. He must still be in the ring.

Then there is Frazier. The athletic stereotype, manipulated by insti-
tutions, specifically boxing. The World Champion, a nightclub Sonny
Liston. The Great White Hope was a superb fighter, too. Without taking
his victory away from him, Frazier stands for why I really find boxing
abhorrent.

Frazier does represent what boxing essentially is: brute force, sheer
violence, which reaps rewards. This is nothing new. It was just presented
in a particularly fashionable way this time.

Again, the American public, and the rest of the world, loses big at
the guiding hands of a few incredibly sly promoters, who netted about $30
million for the cause of violence in the name of sport.

Not only is a bit of humanity chipped away, but also, more simply,
the fight was an extraordinary economic plot for the sole sake of money.
That most of America paid fantastic amounts to see this fight on closed
circuit television makes it taste even better to a status-oriented public
and a greedy promotion office.

Maybe the economy took a boost, but only for a select few. And how
much is the New York school system in debt?

So Ali is a non-loser. Frazier may have won, put in a pyrrhic sense
Neither could lose economically, nor could the government. The promoters
were enormous winners, but ethical losers. The American public and the
world audience were probably the biggest losers. Violence won over
humanity, if you want to go that far.

I am obviously no fight fan, but the dimensions of this one were too
intriguing not to look at. Although I don’t feel it was completely necessary
for him to have fought, I was for Ali, if only because he is an individual
who is manipulating institutions, athletic and social. He defies the stereo-

Naturally, the winners and losers depend on what side you’re on. For
me, the losers went down, but so did Ali in the fifteenth.

Rison Skaters Try to Even Record

By GEORGE LANE
The Bison Hockey Club suffered
its first loss in four games Sunday,
dropping a 9-5 decision to the de-
fending league champion, Lehigh.
The game started with favored

Lehigh pressing heavily in the Blue

defensive zone, but being turned
away each time by a tough Blue
defense, led by standouts Jim
Davenport, Floyd Wallace and Hunt
Worth.

The defense kept forcing the puck
out of the zone and their efforts
were finally rewarded as Paul
Jewell took a pass at center ice,
skated in alone on the goalie and
scored. Less than two minutes later
the Bisons scored again and found
themselves on top 2-0

But, that was as far as the Bisons |
would go, as the Lehigh machine
recovered quickly and put in two to
tie the game. Lehigh’s comeback
was then blessed with a little luck
as they were awarded a goal on a
missed call.

Lehigh defenseman took a shot
from the point that beat the goalie
and bounced off the left front goal-
post, apparently remaining in play.
But, one referee, despite the other
referee’s ruling of ‘no goal,’ and |
vehement protest by the entire
Bison team, ruled that the puck
had hit the back goalpost and
bounced out of the goal, and award-
ed the crucial score to Lehigh

With all the momentum in their
favor now, Lehigh scored two more
ou the slightly shaken Bisons to end
the first period on top, 5-2

Some people, when this
awareness dawns upon them,
become filled with a sense of
destiny; others with a sense of
frustration because, along with
it, they have not been issued a
guidebook explaining why they
were born.

Wouldn't it be helpful if ba-
pies were born with printed tags
around their necks telling what
they were best suited for in life?
Maybe. But if human nature
ran true to’ form, probably a
great many of them would rebel
against having their lives laid
out for them in advance. Peo-
ple want to be free to choose for
themselves.

In fact,- that’s how you be-
come a person in your own
right, through making your
own decisions and discoveries.
That's why God gave Adam

and Eve the power of choice in
the Garden of Eden, because
He wanted the human race to
be real people and not puppets.
That’s why He gives you the
freedom to make your own de-
cisions in life.

But because He loves you,
He tells you in advance what
will happen if you make the
tight choices, and what will
happen if you make the wrong
ones. “If you choose to obey
Me,” He says in effect, “you
will not only be saved from
wasting your life, but you will
find a real sense of purpose in
being aligned with the Primary
Truth from which all other
truths spring.” Jesus Christ
said, “I am the way, the truth,
and the life.” He holds the key
to your personal fulfillment.
Choose Him and you find life.

What you should know about diamonds
when you know it’s for keeps

You've dreamed about your
diamond engagement ring 2 thou-
sand times. But now that you
know it’s for keeps, it’s time to
stop dreaming and start learning
about diamonds and their value.

Because no two diamonds
are exactly e, jewelers have
adopted exacting standards to de-
termine the relative value of each
and every diamond in the world.
These standards include a dia-
mond’s size (carat weight), color,
cut and clarity.

ASTROLITE

COLOR: Fine white diamonds are
quite rare and valued accordingly.
Other shades in relative order of
their worth are: blue, yellow,
brown and black.

CUT: The cut of a diamond—the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—brings out the gem’s fire
and brilliance. Anything less than
correct cut reduces beauty, bril-
liance and value.

CLARITY: Determined by the ab-
sence of small impurities. A per-
fect diamond has no impurities
when examined under ten power
magnification by 2 trained eye.

CARAT: A  diamond’s size is
measured in carats. As a diamond
>5 in size, its price will
even more if the quality
remains constant. But larger dia-
monds of inferior quality may ac-
tually be worth less than smaller,
perfect diamond:

HOW TO PLA

Although it’s important to
know the facts about diamonds,
you certainly don’t have to be an
expert to choose a Keepsake Dia-
mond Ring . . . because Keepsake
guarantees a di mond of fine white
color, correct cut and perfect clar-
ity or replacement assured. The fa-
mous Keepsake certificate provides

ermanent registration, trade-in
value and protection against loss
of diamonds from the setting.

Wrestlers Outgunned at Gettysburg;
Schumacher’s Raiders End Season

By JIM NORTHRIDGE
The Bison grapplers found a little
hard luck and some tough competi-
tion last weekend at the MAC
wrestling tournament in Gettysburg.
In the first four weight classes
the Bisons were unlucky enough to
draw the first seeded man in the
first round each time. Despite solid
efforts by Tom Wason, Jim North-
ridge, Mark Ramage, and Don
Danser, none could make it past
the first round
At 150 pounds Tom Rivoire suf-
fered a heartbreaking 3-2 loss to
Dennis Garetano of Hofstra. When
Garetano lost in the semifinals Tom
found himself barred from wrestl-
in the consolations. This really
hurt the Bison chances for placing
high in the tournament because the
squad received no team points.
Yet, the team did pick up some
valuable team points from co-cap-
tain Al Loesch. Loesch was seeded

second in the tourney. He pinned
Ted Schaffer of American in 4:50
and easily decisioned Rick Greene
of Temple 9-3.

However, Rich Iseke of Hofstra
broke Loesch’s streak as he eked
out a 43 decision in the semi-finals.
Iseke went on to win the finals
while Al placed third by winning
his third match 8-2

The grapplers also had two fourth
place finishers in 118 pounder Tom
Wason and 167 pound Jim Schutz.

After being defeated by first
seeded Rick Swanger of Rider,
Wason turned on the steam. The
unquenchable freshman defeated
two experienced foes 5-4 and 6-4
before losing in the finals of the
consolations to Bob Carullo -of

Jim Schutz won an exciting 8-7
victory over third seeded Joe Vento

Cindermen Teamwork Praised;
Large Turnout Greets Gulden

A joke?
may well

t exactly, for that ad
appear in the ‘‘Classy-
Fyed”’ section of this paper in the
future. Despite a fine turnout for
the spring track team, Coach Gul-
den could still use jumpers to give
the team more depth in that de-
partment and is especially interest-
ed in any pole vaulter who might be
in this reading audience. A lack of
established sprinters is also an early
season problem but one that should
be remedied as the season progres-
ses.

Despite the shortage in these two
events, the coach has been very
pleased with this year’s turnout. The
team has approximately fifty boys
working out which ‘‘must be some
sort of a record” as Coach Gulden
put it.

It’s basically a young team, with
about forty of the boys being fresh-
men and sophomores. With a team

young, inexperience will be a
factor early in the year.

The team will have to gain ex-
perience in a hurry as their tough-
est opponents are scheduled for the
first half of the season. Three of
the first five meets are against
powerful Lehigh, Delaware and
Lafayette.

‘I think we face a very demand-
ing schedule,’ explained Gulden.
“The second half, at the moment,

pears to be easier than the first
half. I think that if we can reach
the halfway mark with a .500 record,
we'll have a winning season. Of
course, that’s going to be very dif-
ticult to do.”

The coach has been impressed by
the competitive attitude of the boys
and particularly encouraged by the
attitude of the underclassmen.

One reason for this could be due
to the fact’ that many of the boys
participated in the winter track
program. This is the first year that
the Bisons have had a competitive
winter program and it no doubt
has been a big help in preparing
the team both mentally and phy-
sically for the outdoor season.

“This has given us a big head
start for the spring season,” ex-
plained the coach. ‘‘People are al-
ready running faster than they ever
have before. This is bound to be a
big help when they’re able to get
out on the track.”

The winter program has been
most beneficial to the distance men
and jumpers but the weight men
will not be hurting from lack of
practice either. The shot putters,
discus men ete. have been warking
out on their own since January. In
fact, one cannot really set a date
for the start of track practice; in-
dividuals have been working out
ever since September

The team’s strongest events ap-
pear to be the distance events,
from the quarter-mile on up. “The
middle distances seem to be our
best events,” said Coach Gulden.
“But we'll need strong perfor-
mance in the sprints and jumps in
order to have a good season.

Coach Gulden was apprehensive |

about making predictions for the
season. “I won’t predict any won
lost records now,” he said.

was too tired physically to capture

Coach Schumacher was not the

weekend, but he did note the fan-
tastic improvement of the entire

experience gained this year he feels

Track Season Ends

By ALAN GROCHAL

Two school records fell in the
IC4A Track Meet, but in what
Coach Gulden called, “‘the best
quality competition I've ever seen,”
the Herd was unable to place any-
one in the finals. An indication of
the stiff competition comes from
the fact that a Rutgers trackman
ran the third fastest 660 in history.

John Larner set a new school in-
door record for the Bisons in the
1000 yard run with a time of 2:15.9,

fective riding technique. The Bison Co-captain finished third in the MAC’s.

while the freshmen medley team
broke the school record by 20
seconds in a time of 8:30.5. Three
of the four frosh runners posted
their personal best times.

Finishing fourth in his heat,
Larner failed to reach the finals by
one place as did Rich Francel in
the 880. Francel’s time was 1:57.3.

Paul Hermle managed a fifth
place in his heat of the 600 while
Bob Smith produced a jump of 45.3
feet in the triple jump.

“This meet provided good ex-
perience for us. The results showed
the need for speedwork and point
up our lack of a running track.”
Coach Gulden commented.

Concluding the winter track sea-
son, the Bisons will enter 35 track-
men in the East Stroudsburg In-
vitational this weekend.

Coach Gulden plans to stack his
best runners in the relays in an
effort to show BU’s three best re-
lay teams. He doesn’t anticipate the
stiff competition that the Bisons en-
countered in IC4A’s.

Paul Kerr Sets Baby Bison Scoring Mark

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

Freshman Paul Kerr has set a
new Bucknell scoring record during
the 1970-71 season with 362 points
for a 21.3 average.

“Tall Paul,’ as he is known to
his teammates, used his height to
good advantage drawing many fouls
as he worked towards the basket
This turned into many points as he
hit on 77.7 percent of his shots from
the line.

The 6-5 forward broke the old
mark of 321 set by Bill Bonkoski
during the 1967-468 campaign. Kerr’s
height on the inside plus an ac-
curate fall away jump shot tallied
113 field goals as ha made one out
of every two shots he took.

Paul credits the teamwork and
passing game for his ability to
reach the scoring plateau. “You
will always find that the top scorer
can get many easy baskets from a
well executed play or an accurate
lead pass,’’ he said.

Paul is also looking forward to

ABS Asks

By JUNE CAFFREY

“Fach student has the right to
determine his own visitation hours,”
Bob Nachshin, president of the As-
sociation of Bucknell Students,
stated. Nachshin was refering to the
ABS resolution requesting Presi-
dent, Charles Watts II, to empower
each living unit to determine its
own visitation policy and his
(Watts) response to the ABS motion.

On March 16 and 17, Nachshin

April 2.

and Russ Pais, ABS vice-president,
had a series of meetings with
President Watts. They stemmed
from the recent questionnaire sent
around to all students by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.

It was the general feeling of the
ABS that this questionnaire 1) did
not speak to the present ABS mo-
tion, 2) President Watts, in a letter
to Nachshin, had referred to the
resolution as “tantamount to a ref-
erendum’”’ (a misunderstanding) 3)
the questionnaire had been am-
biguous, and 4) the question had
been phrased in a way which made
them negatively biased.

After hearing these points, Watts
stated that he had a “‘temptation to
invalidate the whole process but
that it was highly unlikely.”

Nachshin and Pais cited that
many students were unhappy with

athe present visitation policy and
they proceeded to present a hypo-
thetical case to Watts, whereby the
recent survey indicates that a ma-
jority of the students were in favor
of a change in visitation policy.
Watt’s response was as follows:

he Bucknellian

BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA

Decision

“Tf the survey strongly favored
the expansion of visitation hours
and if a recommendation were
made from either the Student Af-
fairs Committee or the ABS with
a clear and logical rationale ac-
companying it, he (Watts) would
give very thoughtful consideration
to the matter. He would undertake
appropriate considerations with the
Board of Trustees and would take
whatever steps necessary to insure
their implementation.”

Nachshin and Pais have set Sep-
tember 1, 1971, as their goal for
the motion to pass and do not feel
that either “Dean Dunlop or Presi-
dent Watts will oppose this date.’

Presently, the ABS has three mo-
tions before Watts: 1) Student par-
ticipation in honorary degree selec-
tion, 2) Appointment of graduating
seniors to the Board of Trustees, 3)

Reflects National Trend
On Visitation Policy Walling Notes Decrease in Applications

By ERIC RIESS

Fitz R. Walling, director of ad-
missions here, said this week that
applications for admission to the
University are down approximately
10 per cent from last year.

In an interview with The Buck-
nellian Walling said, ‘‘Most private
colleges across the country have
noted a similar drop in applications,
while applications to state institu-
tions are generally rising.”’

This trend, noted in an article in
the New York Times (Feb. 28),
has led many educators to cite
the current state of the economy as
well as the continued rising costs
associated with most private in-
stitutions as the causes for the
trend.

Walling noted, “Students are be-
coming more selective when they
choose a school. They can’t afford
to pay $100 to apply to six or seven
different schools if they aren’t sure
that they can get in.”

‘In addition to this, many stu-
dents are finding that they just

cannot afford to attend the Uni-
versity. Currently, we are using a
base figure of $4200 for one year
here. This has been rising steadily
for the past few years and will
probably continue to rise in the
future.”

President Charles H. Watts of-
fered other reasons why applica-
tions to private universities may be
declining, noting, ‘‘Higher educa-
tion may have allowed itself to be
oversold. In the 50’s and 60’s ed-
ucation was thought to be the pan-
acea for all the nations problems,
but the public is beginning to real-
ize that education is not the whole
answer.”

This realization, together with the
increased economic burden of a
college education, has caused a
char in the publi attitude to-
ward her education

AAUP Deliberate
Salary Problems

By RICH DAY

Tuesday evening, the University’s
chapter of the American Association
of University Professors met in the
University Lounge to hear the re-
sults of the state AAUP meeting
recently held in Harrisburg. Pro-
fessor John Peeler, president of the
local chapter, chaired the meeting
_to which only a few faculty mem-

* bers came. He will be attending the

national meeting of the AAUP to be
held in Philadelphia sometime next
month.

Mrs. Zoia Horn, who attended the
Harrisburg meeting, reported the
major concerns of the delegates,
among which was the possibility of
faculties conducting collective bar-
gaining with their respective schools
concerning pay raises.

Mt. Everest Climber
Unsoeld Proffers ‘Alternative Education’

By ED MARSTON

“By what right, by what ration-
ale, have you divided the world
into courses?”’, asked Willie Unsoeld
in a discussion Monday night con-
cerning alternatives in education.

Unsoeld had been at the Uni-
versity since Friday, hosting a fire-
side at Cowan and a slide presen-
tation on his assents of Mount
Everest.

Although obviously tired from
three days of activities, Unsoeld
spoke enthusiastically about the ex-
periment in education which begins
next fall at Evergreen State Col-
lege, where he is a faculty mem-
ber.

Evergreen, located in Olympia,
Washington, is an attempt to rep-
resent in a college a unified view
of knowledge and of society. It has
no departments, grades, or courses
in any traditional sense.

Unsoeld spoke of the changes in
our society, technological and philo-
sophic, which have brought about
the need for a new approach to
education. Since the death of God
as a viable expression of our re-
lationship to the universe, Unsoeld
said, men have been “cast adrift

with only our human resources and
each other.”
Therefore, we

that the relationship of faculty

At Evergreen, and at institutions
like Evergreen, the attempt is be-

Willie Unsoeld

ing made to order the classroom
around individuals, not around po-
sitions of spurious authority.

Classes are small, usually involv-
ing about ten persons. Unsoeld said
that as faculty member his role
was that of a “guide,” not claim-
ing any monopoly on expertise in
the broad issues discussed. A “‘port-
folio’ evaluation takes the place
of grades

A student at Evergreen can par-
ticipate in the coordinated studies
plan or can “‘contact’’ with a pro-
fessor to pursue an interest of his
own choosing.

Another issue which was discus-
sed is the tendency toward frag-
mentation of knowledge. Unsoeld
described our present direction as
“rank specialization, run rampant,
for all the wrong reasons.” He
suggested that each separate aca-
demic discipline has a vested in-
terest in its own perpetuation which
is detrimental to the pursuit of
knowledge.

“We don’t need experts or lonely
scholars. What we need more of in
this world is citizens—citizens of

Individuals should have the right to
determine guidelines for their own con-
duct. Unaccordingly, the issue of 24-hour
open dorms still lingers unresolved.

The administration has given the
students minimal concessions thus far.
The ABS asked President Watts to de- are
clare dorm autonomy in February, but
the President is waiting for the results
of the recent Student Affairs Committee
poll on attitudes towards present living
situations.

The discussion among students and
administrators centers on whether the
students should decide the issue for
themselves. Administrators have offered
lin nary arguments. They claim that

Junk Mail

To the Editor

Recently, concern has been ex-
pressed over the mass of junk mail
that confronts us regularly in our
mail boxes After careful obser-
vation for a couple of weeks now, it
appears that the biggest culprit in
this respect is perhaps not Time,
Newsweek or the Record Club of
America, but our campus itself

More often than not, the mailbox
welcomes you with an overdose of
notices describing the various cam-
pus activities. While this is proba-
bly an attempt to reach each in-
dividual student, one cannot help
noticing that most of us toss them
into conveniently located trash cans
after only a_ brief glance at the
headline. The Campus Calendar and
the Bucknellian adequately inform
the students about the goings-on in
the campus. (This, in itself, is a
duplication!) The ubiquitous bul-

Editor’s Note: The following “ >eople’s Peace Treaty” was negotiated
by representatives of the National Student Association of the U.S. and

student representatives from North and South Vietnam,

in November,

1970. A nationwide campaign is now being waged to ratify this treaty at
the grassroots level. Groups are being asked to write their own preambles

and then sign the treaty.

Other national groups, such as y. A. F., are opposing the treaty on
the gounds that it seriously jeopardizes present U.S. plans for Vietnamiza-

tion of the war.

JOINT TREATY OF PEACE
BETWEEN
THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, SOUTH VIETNAM AND
NORTH VIETNAM

1. The Americans agree to immediate

and total withdrawal from Vietnam,

and publicly to set the date by which all U.S. military forces will be re-

moved.

2. The Vietnamese pledge that as soon as the U.S. government publicly
sets a date for total withdrawal: ‘
They will enter discussions to secure the release of all American

prisoners, including pilots captured while bombing North Vietnam.

There will be an immediate cease-fire between U.S. forces and
those led by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South

Vietnam

4. They will enter discussions on the procedures to guarantee the
safety of all withdrawing troops.

P

5. The Americans pledge to end the imposition of Thieu-Ky-Khiem on the

people of South Vietnam in order to insure their right to self-determina-
tion and so that all political prisoners can be released.

6. The Vietnamese pledge to form a provision! coalition government
to organize democratic elections. All parties agree to respect the

results of elections in which al

1 South Vietnamese can participate

freely without the presence of any foreign troops.

The South Vietnamese pledge to enter discussion of procedures to
guarantee the safety and political freedom of those South Vietna-

regime

The Americans and Vietnamese agree to respect the independence,
peace and neutrality of Laos and Cambodia in accord with the 1954
and 1962 Geneva Convent and not to interfere in the internal
affairs of these two countries.

Upon these points of agreement, we pledge to end the war and re-
solve all other questions in the spirit of self-determination and
mutual respect for the independence and political freedom of the

N RESPONSE:

To the Editor:

The Draft is a national scandal.
Prominent political figures, from
Barry Goldwater to Eugene Mc-
Carthy, agree that the Draft should
be ended. We of the Bucknell Chap-
ter of Young Americans for Free-
dom are strongly in favor of the
abolition of the Draft during peace-
time and the institution of a volunte-
er army.

There are two basic reasons why
the Draft should be ended:

1) The present Draft is ridiculous-
ly expensive. It costs billions of
dollars to train men who will only
be in the army for two years: This
is not to mention the tremendous
cost of staffing several thousand
Draft Boards. A volunteer army is
readily observable to be more eco-
nomically feasible than the present
system.

2) Most important of all, peace-
time conscription is undeniably a
violation of individual liberty. Ex-
cept as punishment for crime, The
Constitution of the United States as-

YAF

ENKI
sures us of freedom from the im-
position of involuntary servitude.
Young men between the ages of 19
and 26 have committed no crime.
Except in time of national emer-
gency, it must be the free choice
of the individual to offer or not to
offer his services to his country.
The Bucknell YAF will be placing
petitions in the cafeterias on Wed-
nesday night, March 17. There will
also be a petition posted on the
bulletin board outside Vaughan
Literature Building. The petition
will be addressed to Senator Hugh
Scott calling for (1) an end to the’
peacetime Draft, (2) the establish-
ment of a volunteer army (3) with
the provision of a one-year exten-
sion of the present system in order
to allow time for an efficient trans-
ition to the volunteer system. We
urge all members of the Bucknell
community to join with us in op-
position to peacetime conscription.

Grade Pressure?
To the Editor:

. I would like to refute Mr.
Mates’ letter of March 12
Firstly, he said I had a “misper-
ception about the purpose of grades

** Possibly I misinterpreted what
he wrote but let me quote from
that letter of his. Mr. Mates talks of
the ‘non-competitive, zero-pressure
environment’ of a pass-fail system
which creates “‘leisurely dilettant-
ism.” He goes on to note that a
graduate ‘will have to face com-
petition in getting a job” and that
“he will constantly be under time
pressure and constantly evaluated.”
This theme of competition and pres-
sure is repeated throughout his

letter. This indicates to me that he
sees the purpose of a grade as being
a form of pressure which the stu-
dent must get used to in preparation
for life. If one were to combine his
first letter with his second which
states that ‘“‘the grade is simply a
convenient means of keeping score,”
one might also be led to believe that
monetry payment at a job serves
the same purpose. Furthermore, he
says that students who feel the
need to excell “would do well with
or without grades.” This is exactly
the point. If students who do feel
the need to excell have no use for
grades, then what purpose do
grades serve for those who do not
have this need or a self-motivated
interest other than as a form
of pressure?

Mr. Mates finds further issue con-
cerning the distinction between
learning “‘just for the sake of learn-
ing” and “learning as a preparation
for life.” Whereas he sees no dif-
ference between the two, I find that
one may preclude the other. While
learning for curisoity’s sake may
prepare one for the future, learning
soley for preparation for life (a duty
around which Mr. Mates seems to
think the University should be cen-
tered) does not necessarily imply

Engineering Department Offers
Environmental Studies Course

By ROBERT WENDEL

“J would like the people to leave
this course with an appreciation for
the enormity of the pollution prob-
lem, and a feeling that, although
the problems are in most cases
solvable, they will not disappear
overnight.”

This expresses the general ob-
jective for the new chemical en-
gineering course No. 260, which will
be offered next semester, and which
is open to all members of the aca-
demic community

The statement was made by Dr.
Eugene Greskovich, assistant pro-
fessor of chemical engineering who
along with Dr. James Pommers-
heim, associate professor of chemi-
cal engineering, will be teaching
the course

Greskovich went on to state that
the course will be unstructured in
the traditional sense. Although there
will be some kind of textbook, much
of the information for the course
will come from magazines, journals,
movies, and guest speakers

In discussing the direction of the
course, Greskovich stated that the
whole course will be ‘‘an attempt to
bring together students with dif-
ferent interests to discuss the var-
ious facets of the environmental
problem.”

Some of these facets as explained
will be “Production—Its Economic
and Environmental Aspects’; ‘The
Web of Responsibility;” ‘‘Engineer-
ing Action and Ethics;” “Anti-pol-
lution Devices and Techniques;” and
“Pederal, State, and Local Regula-
tions.””

One of the tasks which will be ex-
plored according to Greskovich will

be “‘anti-technology.” He feels that
in some cases pollution could be
stopped simply by using the argu-
ment that if a given process is pol-
luting the environment, it should
simply be shut down.

However, he went on to say that
in most cases, public demand for
a product prevents this approach,
and that it is precisely the problem
of public demand which makes the
anti-pollution dilemma so
ous.””

Greskovich stated that in an effort
to bring
problem, and its political implica-
tions into perspective, he intends to
go to Washington, D. C. to try to
draw guest speakers and lecturers,

to discuss the national issue, and |

also to bring local and state of-
ficials from Williamsport.
Greskovich emphasized that the
course is not “engineering” per se
and would not necessarily be

“easier” for an engineering major. |
In fact, as planned now, there |

would not be any exams, but rather

the course grade would be based |

on classwork and participation.

In conclusion, he said “I’m hoping |
this course engenders some really |
offer |

good discussion, and will
everyone a soap box from which
they can make their feelings
known.”

enorm-

both the extent of the |

learning for personal pleasure. In
fact, it is possible a student could
go through a university learning
not what he wants to, but what
someone else says he has to.

Lastly, I would like to comment
on the overall theme Mr. Mates has
been preoccupied with, which can
be summed up in his words, “.. .
the problems we face today cannot
be solved without the most dis-
ciplined application of knowledge
we are capable of.” Certainly,
proper application of knowledge is
a prerequisite to solving world pro-
blems but Mr. Mates’ entire at-
titude seems to be toward forcing
people to follow specific guidelines
of study and preparation in order
that, like robots, they can go out
and apply their knowledge to the
benefit of humanity no matter how
bored or unfulfilled they may feel.
There is a catch, though. By this
very specificity one’s creativity is
stifled . . . Personally I prefer life
to be an adventure or exploration
whereas Mr. Mates seems to see
himself as part of a great American
movement to produce scientific and
literary mechanization even at the
cost of meaningful human relations.

I will not end with a challenge

_ . But I will accept his challenge
and do my best to see if my plan
might be at least carried out on an
experimental basis

Sincerely,
John de Benedictis

Dateline: The Campus

By STEVE SHEDD

Several student papers have been suspended for printing abor-
tion referral service advertisements. A February 2 article in the
“Chronicle for Higher Education” noted that student papers on at
least eight campuses have been suspended for the printing of the
ads. The student papers of Concordia College, Niagra University,
University of Georgia, and Ohio University were listed as some of
those temporarily closed down. The Chronicle stated that most
people do not realize that the referra vice alone can cost one
hundred dollars or more. There is referral information free on most
campuses as well as through Planned Parenthood offices

The Temple University News reported that information concern-
ing the procuring of the birth control pill is now available to any
female student on the campus. It was stated that the Health Service
would not turn the pill over to anyone, but they would refer stu-
dents to the Family Planning Center of the Temple University
Hospital. All that is required is a referral form signed by a doctor
for the Health Service. Next, an appointment is scheduled at the
Family Planning Center. A physical examination is administered as
well as advice on contraceptive methods. The type of pills required
as indicated by the examination are then distributed free of charge.

The Bullet, Mary Washington College’s newspaper relates that
birth control pills are readily available on that campus. Several
doctors in the vicinity will prescribe the oral contraceptive, to un-
married women, with no questions asked, after a thorough physical
examination and a Pap smear. It we against the use of the pill
even though it is the most reliable contr eptive. (It has only a one
per cent chance of failure) This warning stems from information
supplied by distinguished res' chers noting several possible side
effects of the pill. Examples are plood-clotting, cancer, heart-disease,
diabetes and jaundice which can afflict the user

has said in a paper presented ip
March 1970 to the American As-

“there is growing evidence of re-
bellion againse the collegiate formal
educational process and the stand-
ard degree pattern.”

He continued, “Dropping out —
and intermittently dropping in again
— may become a much more com-
mon occurence . . . In short, the
danger is real that expansion-mind-
ed state planning agencies may
overbuild the state systems of high-
er education by the middle or late
1970s. As we approach that danger
point, a substantial portion of the
private section will be fighting a
losing battle for survival.”

In conclusion, Cartter stated,
“Only those private institutions
that provide an educational exper-
ience far superior to that of the
public institutions are likely to sur-
vive in a world with more openings
than students.”

not advocate teachers’ strikes, nor

Professor Peeler, commenting on

The Susquehanna Economic De-
velopment Association, located in
the Timberhaven Conference Center
on Rt. 15, is a multi-county plann-
ing and development organization
serving an area of central Pennsyl-
vania consisting of 6300 square
miles of land and 550,000 people.

SEDA receives funds from the
Appalachian Regional Commission,
put also from private industry and
the eleven county governments in
the SEDA region.

SEDA has done studies and made
recommendations for handling prob-
lems in such areas as regional
sewer systems, solid waste manage-
ment, water resource management,
highways, industrial growth, health
services, housing and tourism.

The following interview was held
with Richard Kauffman, director of
environmental planning at SEDA.

Bucknellian: Do you see any con-
flict between SEDA’s development
goals and its goal of preserving the
quality of the environment?

Kauffman: I wouldn’t put it quite
that way, but I think conflicts do
arise in certain situations. For ex-
ample, SEDA was asked by the
Appalachian Commission to express
its views on the new Appalachian
Throughway. This highway will pro-
mote industrial development, and I
am not against it, but I recommend
that every dollar the federal and

state governments put into highway
construction should be matched with
similar dollars to take care of the
environmental problems that will

be created by the influx of addi-
tional people and industry. But it
is doubtful that the commission will
accept this recommendation.

B: What specific activities of
SEDA are aimed at preserving the
environment?

K: For one thing, we are doing
solid waste studies for the counties
in our region. Sanitary landfill is
the method we promote, because
this is a rural area and cost is a
real consideration.

The land fills will solve the im-
mediate problem, but in the long
run we may run out of landfill
areas, and so we are also hoping
to develop a regional plan promot-
ing the resource recovery concept.

We are toying with the idea of in-
stalling at the new landfill to be
built in Union County, some means
of pulling out the paper, glass bot-
tles, ferrous metals, and so forth
The U.S. Bureau of Mines has re-
cently developed equipment that will
do this. The separated materials
can then be transferred to facilities
for recycling that already exist,
such as National Gypsum, which
makes use of old paper.

All municipalities in Union County
have accepted our proposal, which
will enable Lewisburg to close up
its landfill, which has been a very
poor one because of its location on
a flood plain. But in other counties

we haven’t had such good coopera-
tion. The problem of getting several
communities to cooperate on one
plan has also plagued us in our
plans for r gional sewer systems.

B: What are the prospects for
getting better cooperation on such

regional plans?

K: To encourage regionalization,

that is, getting several municipali-
ties to cooperate on a regional plan,

To Be Young, Gifted and Black,
lest season’s longest running off-
Broadway comedy-drama, will be
presented at 8:30 p.m. tonight in
Soleman Theatre. Directed by Will
Mott, the road company stars three
of the initial New York cast mem-
pers: Tina Sattin, Bernard Ward,
and Garry Mitchell.

The production is a self portrait
of and by Lorraine Hansberry, the
brilliant author of A Raisin in the
Sun. It is a major statement re-
creating the world of the woman,
the artist, and the black experience,
and is presented by a interracial
cast who in turn portray Miss Hans-
berry, the people who most affected
her, and the characters she created.

With the presentation of A Raisin
in the Sun, Lorraine Hansberry was
the youngest dramatist ever to win
the New York Drama Critics Award
for “The Best Play of the Year.”
When cancer claimed her life five
years later, at 34, her second play,
The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Win-
dow was running on Broadway. Les
Blanes, produced posthumously this
season, has been widely mentioned
as a contender for the “Tony” and
Crities Circle Awards.

“An extraordinary achievement
so brilliantly and tenderly alive,”
wrote Nat Hentoff in the New York
Sunday Times of To Be Young,
Gifted and Black. Time Magazine
called it ‘‘a milestone in the black-
white confrontation,” while Harold
Clurman in The Nation hailed it as
“an understanding embrace of our
fellow men.”

Tickets for the performance may
be obtained from the Bookstore for
$2.50.

Tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. in
Vaughan Literature Auditorium,
Hilltop will feature Viva Maria, a
1966 film by director Louis Malle. A
“fresh,”  ‘‘delightfully relaxed”
comedy, the film is a handsomely
photographed, romantic fairy tale
for adults.

Jeanne Moreau plays the leading
lady of a vaudeville troup, making
its way through Central America at
the turn of the century. Wary, but
not weary of love, she is: on the
lookout for a grand passion to warm
her twilight years, which eventually
comes (and goes) in the form of a
local revolutionary (George Hamil-

ton).

Bridgette Bardot joins the vaude-
ville troupe when her anarchist
father is killed trying to blow up a
bridge. She is as innocently indis-
criminant about her love as she is
with TNT, and is contrasted with
the heavy-breathing passion of Mor-
eau.

The two females combine to carry
on the work of the soon dead Hamil-
ton, involving themselves in exploits
which include the single-handed
storming of a gun emplacement by
3ardot, the strategic placing of a
wasps nest to stop an armored
train, and the training of a magic-
ian’s doves into an air force.

In Viva Maria, Malle satirizes
political passions and the violence
they beget, while maintaining a
comic mood, and one removed from
reality.

At Sunbury’s Strand, Sidney J.
Furie’s Little Fauss and Big Halsy
is the main attraction. Gazing upon
small-time racing, endurance runs,
and hill climbs, the two “‘quintes-
sentially American characters” of
Fauss (Michael J. Pollard) and
Halsy (Robert Redford) are de-
veloped.

the state planning board should re-
quire that municipalities within a
certain sewer region or a certain
solid waste region either cooperate
in a regional plan or not receive as-
sistance from the state or federal
government for that particular ac-
tivity.

This hasn’t been done in the past,
because estblishing such regions
throughout the state would be such
a costly undertaking, but I think it
may be done in the future.

B: There was a proposal some
years ago to use old strip mine pits
in this area as disposal sites for
wastes from Philadelphia. Will this

proposal be renewed?

K: Yes. The idea failed last time
because the Reading Railroad,
which bought some of the pits an-
nounced that it was going to dispose
there, failed to use diplomacy and
antagonized the local people.

The main obstacle now is a po-
litical one. Both the township super-
visors and the county commissioners
would like to accept Philadelphia
refuse, but the question is whether
the county or the township gets the
money which the railroad will pay
for the right to dump. Eventually
they will probably decide to split it
and we will see this plan imple-

mented

B: How do you feel about nuclear
power?

K: People have to make up their
minds about this. If they are willing
to reduce their consumption of
electricity, to stop using their vacu-
um cleaners and television sets,
fine. But if not, then the demand
for power will keep increasing, and
nuclear power will be necessary.

B: Are cooling towers now re-
quired on all nuclear power plants?

K: Definitely. Even on some fossil
fuel plants, such as the new one at
Washingtonville, cooling towers are
being installed.

Yoga: For Fun and Profit

By JACKIE STUBBA

If you've ever passed by Hunt
living room on a Tuesday night be-
tween 9 and 10 p.m., you may have
noticed about a dozen people scat-
tered on the floor with their bodies
pent in unbelievable positions, ab-
sorbed in thought. Don’t worry, this
is not a sensitivity session left over
from freshman orientation. It’s one
of the weekly Yoga classes spon-
sored by Indigo.

Marcy Newcomer, a sophomare
who organized the Jan Plan Yoga
classes, is continuing her instruc-
tion throughout this semester and
possibly next fall also. This popular
art of coordinating one’s mind and
body is open to anyone interested
in attending each week or even
those curious in coming to one class.

position; others have to gradually
work into it. Everyone is at a dif-
ferent level of dexterity, as the
sound of cracking bones will verify.
And as you stretch your muscles
and increase your flexibility, you
may even gorw an inch or two in
the process.

Yoga is an ancient practice from
the Far Eastern cult. According to
tradition and the writings of an-
cient manuscripts, each exercise
has a specific name, such as the Co-
bra, the Lion, or the Sun Salutation.
Animal references are common,
however the aged gurus seemed to
have omitted one—the Bison. This
one does exist and has several vari-
ations. If you don’t think so,
observe the people coming 0

in line about to go in. Watching
them may inspire you to do this too

Yoga is fun to perform, but there
is also a serious side to it. After
an hour of exercising and resting
the group goes into individual medi-

ch week the group engages in
bi y the same
stretches, bends and twists. Unlike
calisthenics, every part of the body
is used, conditioning the muscles to
stretch farther, with greater flexi-
bility. Thus the inexperienced novice
need not be nervous or embarrassed
at his own underdeveloped form.
For some people it comes natural
to twist their legs into the Lotus

Reviewer Hails ‘Trojan Women’ Production

By SANDRA MARTIN

Jean-Paul Sartre has described
the style of The Trojan Women as
“not a tragedy like the Antigone,
put an oratorio.” Taken as such, it
is possible to view Cap and Dag-
ger’s latest production from that
standpoint—as a heroic text put

ludes. All three were interwoven
skillfully to achieve a collage of al-
ternating rhythms—the slow ca-
dence of the Trojan women and
chorus followed by the explosive,
forceful intrusion of the Greeks.

Novel Approaches

The setting, designed by James
Lyon, also served to emphasize the
staging of Dr. Powers. The “jungle
gyms’ at the rear of a raked stage,
representing the ruins of Troy, were
employed as cages both restraining
and protecting the women of Troy;
the set, as a whole effectively com-
municated the desolate state of the
city and its inhabitants.

Novel, too, was the approach to-
wards the god Poseidon and the
goddess Pallas Athena—the essence
of their power over man’s destiny
was exposed by representing them
as massive mastheads and utiliz-
ing offstage voices. Perhaps here
the use of either a single voice or
an entire chorus per deity would
have been less disconcerting than
the constant switching of voices;
nevertheless, the effect was time-
less—as the gods plan the ultimate
fate of men while Hecuba lies help-
less on the ground, so do the diplo-
mats of present times determine the
destiny of peoples today.

The Play of Light

The lighting effects conveyed the
message of this oratorio, contrast-
ing harsh, realistic light that came
to be identified with the Greek con-
tingent, to the more ethereal light
for the Trojan women. Especially
powerful were the spotlighting on
the women during their soliloquies
and the special light sequence
utilized for the final burning of
Troy.

The costuming also served to
highlight the various circumstances

of the characters, from the grimy
tatters of the defeated Trojans,
through the polished uniforms of
the Greek soldiers, to the gaudy
finery of Helen.

The Cast

No review of a dramatic produc-
tion is considered complete with-
out an examination of the acting in-
volved. Terry Ellis as Hecuba was
a true vision of wearied but un-
faltering strength; the range of emo-
tions she conveyed and the clarity
of her delivery were nothing less
than inspiring.

The scene involving Cassandra,
as portrayed by Joan Billig, was to
my mind the most theatrically ex-
citing event of the evening. Her ex-
cellently choreographed dance of
madness, coupled with a convinc-
ing intensity, provided the audience
with an unmatched display of vir-
tuosity.

Sally Gudbrandsen’s Andromache
seemed somewhat hindered by a
stiffness of movement; but in her
first appearance on the Coleman
stage, she delivered her speeches
well, tapping an inner source for
a sustained performance. Miss Gud-
brandsen was at her best in her
quiet soliloquy addressed to the
audience

Talthybios is perhaps Euripides’
most human character in the play—
he has none of the clearly defined
motives of the others and as such
is a complex character to analyze.
Robert Colgan admirably mastered
the divided sympathies of Talthybios
and performed well, although he had

a studiously affected movement pat-
tern that detracted from a totally
polished performance.

Nancy Henry’s Helen was the
epitome of coy and cunning femin-
ine deception—a stark contrast to
the honest despair of her Trojan
counterparts. As Hecuba delivered
a retort to Helen’s explanation of
her motives, Miss Henry’s facial
demeanor clearly expressed her in-
difference and wily character.

} Bison Skaters Stalemate with Eagles;

Ellenberger,

By GEORGE LANE
Seeking to extend their winning
streak over the North Penn Eagles
to three games in three seasons,
the Bison Hockey Club let leads of
2-9 and 3-1 slip by them as the
agles rallied to tie the Bisons 3-3.
The Eagles were penalized and
the Bisons capitalized before one
minute had elapsed in the first

period. With one of the Eagles off
for tripping, Steve Ward took a
twenty-footer which Paul Jewell,
positioned in front of the net, tipped
in to put the Bisons out in front, 1-0

The Eagles got the edge in play
over the next ten minutes, as they
tested Blue goalie Steve Levings,
but it was the Bisons who scored
next on Jim Jones’ first goal of the

season. Jonesy came in on a break
and shot it right at the goaltender.
But he was on the puck for the re-
bound shot and flipped it over the
fallen goalie to give the Bisons a
2-6 edge.

North Penn quickly cut the Bisons
lead in half as they scored from a
scramble in front of the net. But,
less than two minutes later, Terry
Ellenberger scored the Bisons third,
and last, goal on a neat backhander
that completely fooled the goaltend-
er and beat him on his glove side.

The second period was quite a
different story. Not rattled, the
Eagles came on strong as the Bisons
tried to sit on their lead. Their pres-
sure paid off as they scored number
two on a slap shot to the far corner
of the net from the point and num-
per three on a shot from in close

This seemed to shake up the
Bisons, and they arted matching
the Eagles’ offensive push Both
teams played out the second period,
and all of the third, on a par with
each other. Play was mostly at
center ice with only a couple of
good chances for either side. Neither
was able to score again, though, as
the game remained tied to the end.

The tie put the Bisons final sea-
son mark at 2-3-2. Although falling
short of the .500 level this time, the
team is looking forward to break-
ing it next season in what hopefully
will be an expanded, more diversi-
fied schedule.

Thinclads Prep for Spring Debut

By JEFF QUINZER

The winter trackmen continued
setting new individual marks and
brez s old school records as they
concluded the indoor season this
Saturday in the East Stroudsburg
Invitational.

The performances of the distance
men runners was particularly en-
couraging to Coach Arthur Gulden
as the distance medley relay placed
third while setting a new school
record (10:35.2

The team consisted of Tom Hag-
gerty, Paul Hermle, John Larner
and Rich Francel. Haggerty started
by running the half-mile in 2:04.3
and was followed by Hermle’s 51.8
quarter-mile Rich Francel ran the
three quarter-mile leg in 3:10.8 and
John Larner finished with a time
of 4:28.3 for the mile.

The strong performances by these
runners supported the preseason
notion that the middle distances
would be the team’s strongest
events. For Hermle, Francel and
Larner, the times represented their
best efforts in those events to date,
a sign that they are just reaching
their potential. In the last several
indoor meets, these runners Ccon-
sistently reduced their times from
week to week, continually break-
ing their previous best time from
the week before.

Another Bison record fell on
Saturday, this one to freshman Glen
Martin. Glen broke the freshman in-
door shot putt record with a toss of
44 feet and 9 inches. Sophomore
Kurt Barefoot registered a throw of
45 feet, 7 inches.

Len Dillenger cleared 6 feet and
Randy Mattison 5 feet 10 inches in
the high jump, while Doug McCord,
running in his first 6000, turned in a
time of 1:19. Freshman Scott Bar-
tren ran the two-mile in 10:58 to

take a second place in his heat.
Scott was forced to set the pace of
the race for the first time this year
and handled the task well.

In yet another first, the two-mile
relay team was disqualified after
having placed in their section. The
officials ruled that the Bisons were
guilty of running over the dividing
line between the lanes and were
charged with pushing.

The Bisons didn’t fare as well in
the sprints as m the other events
but Coach Gulden wasn’t particular-
ly surprised.

That has to be expected,” €X-

plained the coach. “The boys may
have looked a little flat but that’s
just because we haven’t done much
speed work I’m sure that once we
get out on the track and are able
to get in more work with the em-
phasis on speed, the times will come
down.’

for the start of the spring season.

Phi Psi Wins IM Basketball,
Durbiano Leads All Scorers

By ALAN GROCHAL

A driving layup by John Durbiano
with only 20 seconds left in the
overtime period earned Phi Kappa
Psi a 42-40 victory over Lambda
Chi Alpha, and the intramural
championship

Phi Psi was originally behind by
2 points with only 50 seconds left,
put a field goal by Shep Huntington
tied the score. They then stole a
pass from Lambda Chi to set up
Durbiano’s heroics

Both teams had a chance to win
the game in regulation time. The
score was tied with 1:20 left, but
neither team scored any more be-
fore the overtime period. Phi Psi’s
Durbiano had an opportunity with 8
seconds left, but failed to capitalize
on a crucial one and one situation

Lambda Chi owned a height ad-

vantage, but Phi Psi’s defense
helped neutralize any rebounding
disadvantage

Phi Psi Coach Tom Reznor
especially cited the defense of Bud
Libby, Huntington, and Durbiano on
Lambda Chi’s leading scorer, Bob
Pr as a major factor in the
game. Price was held to 7 points.
Durbiano led all scorers with 23
points.

Both teams used a zone defense,
which helps explain the relatively

Stroke of Luck

O'Keeffe Stars in Eastern Meet;
Smashes Three School Records

By MARK KNODERER

Peter O’Keeffe made an epilog to
the swimming season last weekend
as he buried three more school
records in an outstanding perform-
ance at the Eastern Collegiate
swimming championships

The Bisons one-man team made
quite a splash as he finished second
in the 200 yard backstroke, third in
the 100 yard backstroke, and twelfth
in the 211 IM. His 26 total points
earned Bucknell thirteenth place in
a meet which drew teams from
North Carolina to New Hampshire.

Navy’s Rick Stringer won the 200
backstroke in 1:56.4, but O’keeffe,
who led until the last lap, was right
behind at 1:57.2. The 100 backstroke
was won by Army’s Ben Ross at
53.1 with Princeton’s Charles Camp-
bell second, and O’Keeffe third. His
time of 53.8 broke the old Bucknell
record by 1.1 seconds.

The 200 IM was an extremely
tight race, as Villanova’s Tom Aretz
won with a time of .8, and O’Ke-
effe was twelfth at 2:03.1. In the
preliminaries he had set a new
school record of 2:02.5.

Season’s Show

season, Coach Jamieson said “has
been the depth and strength of mid-
field units who have to play at
both ends of the field and who do
most of the running and actual hard
play.”

Returning midfield players are
Bob Worthen, Charles Swoka, Curt
Torell, and Randy Harris. All these
men have had two years playing
experience. Others at midfield are
Buck McPhail, Randy Goat, Doug
McClellan, Kevin McCabe, and Mon-
roe Diefendorf

Rounding out the rest of the team
are Eugene Bitchko, Gary Germ-
ond, Jim Kirkley, Richard Lotze,
Bruce McCdenathan, Daniel Stew-
art, and Robert Jennings.

The toughness of Bucknell’s sche-
dule has been upgraded from last
year. Included are Syracuse, Rut-

rs, and Washington College who

ranked in the top 20 teams in
the nation.

Delaware and Franklin and Mar-
shall, teams which Bucknell lost to
last year are also scheduled. Both
teams have returning veteran play-
ers. Filling out the schedule are
Gettysburg, Lehigh, Lafayette, Dick-
inson, Penn State, and Leabnon
Valley.

Overall, Pennsylvania placed first,
Princeton second, Yale third, Dart-
mouth fourth, and North Carolina
State fifth. Villanova’s Aretz was a
triple winner capturing the 220 IM,
100 breast, and 200 breast. Double
winners included Navy’s Rex Hand
(50 free, 100 free) and Dave Pearl
(100 fly, 200 fly), and Penn’s Russ
Varley (500 free, 1650 free)

O’Keeffe’s performance gained a
victory of sorts for the team. Rut-
gers, a team which defeated the
tankers during the regular season,
placed fourteenth with 25 points.

Over Spring vacation O’Keeffe
and freshman Steve Winings will
travel to Ames, Iowa to participate
in the NCAA university division
national championships. They will
be the first Bucknell swimmers ever
to participate in this meet, and we
wish them the best of luck.

Rivoire Finishes Fourth;
Enters National Tourney

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

Wrestling co-captain Tom Rivoire
placed fourth in the Eastern Region-
al Tournament held at Princeton
last weekend and thus became the
first wrestler in Bucknell history to
enter the Nationals. In order to
qualify for Nationals, a wrestler
must place in the top five of the
regional tournament.

In his first bout, the dedicated
junior used a change in tactics to
avenge a dual meet defeat against
John Allen of Syracuse. At the
matchup, Rivoire was caught in a
five point move and lost a 6-1 de-
cision. The cause of this defeat was
his relentless pressuring for a take-
down.

This time Rivoire changed his
style and it paid off handsomely.
Cautiously working, using deliberate
moves, the two grapplers ended the
first period in a scoreless stalemate.

Tom gave up a point on an escape
as Allen proved to be too fresh to

Junior Tom Rivoire uses an extremely aggressive ride to pile up riding
time. He will wrestle in the 150 pound weight class in the Nationals.

wrestlers circled the mat, warily

In the final period, down by one
point, Rivoire pushed into the lead
as Allen attempted to ride Tom
with legs. Rivoire managed to grab
Allen’s hips and pull himself on top
for two critical points on a reversal.
But in his final effort, Allen man-
aged to escape to end the regula-
tion match in a 2-2 draw.

The overtime bout consisted of
three one-minute periods and here
Tom’s conditioning spelled the dif-
ference. Working under pressure,
Rivoire prevented Allen from gett-
ing any penetration for the take-
down.

In the second overtime period,
Rivoire rode out his opponent in
such a manner that the Syracuse
star tired visibly.

From the defensive position in the
final period Tom escaped within
six seconds and then, as he put it,
“J ran for my life!” Clinching an
exciting 3-2 victory Tom was on his
way towards placing.

Tom then wrestled the first seed-
ed Gillespie in the quarter finals and
was pinned with one second left in
the final period. However, the junior
grappler worked his way into the
consolation finals with some ex-
cellent luck.

In the finals he met Don Stone of
Penn State, who was EIWA champ
this year. Tom allowed an escape
and a takedown but he couldn’t
complete a move offensively and
lost a close 3-0 decision.

Tom will enter the Nationals a
week from today, Friday, and
Saturday. They will be held at Au-
burn University in Alabama. And
how does Rivoire feel about his tre-
mendous achievement?

“J’m psyched right out of my
mind and feel really lucky! This is
going to be a fantastic opportunity
and experience for me.”

Schedule Expanded
_ Beach Boys, Taylor Appear In Concert

By RICHARD HUMPHREY

The Bucknell Concert Committee
has announced two additions to its
current concert series program.

On Friday, April 23, the Beach
Boys will be appearing on campus
in a special promotional concert,
in association with Warner Bros
Records.

The special tour was arranged as
a result of the overwhelming re-
ception the group received at the
Big Sur Festival and at Carnegie
Hall.

Richard Merlis of World Maga-
zine describes the Beach Boys’ ap-
pearance at Carnegie Hall as “of-
fering the audience, who were vir-
tually rapt in awe, the greatest
performance I have ever witnessed
in Carnegie Hall or any other place
where rock has ever been played.”

The Beach Boys will present one
full two hour show in Davis Gym.
Admission is $3.50 general admis-
sion and $1.00 for season ticket
holders.

Livingston Taylor will share the
stage with Tom Rush for the May
sixth Houseparty week-end concert.
Livingston, the brother of James
Taylor, has released an album
composed of his own material under
the Capricorn label. Tickets are

$4.00 general admission.

After nine years and over sixty-
five million record sales, the Beach
Boys have re-emerged as a result
of their most recent release, “‘Sun-
flower.’ Robert Christagau of The
Village Voice classified ‘‘Sun-
flower’ as being one of the twelve
best albums of 1970. This album
is now on reserve in the library.

The Beach Boys recorded the
album on their $200,000 custom
sound system, the first of its kind
in the world and a system which
has never been duplicated.

Andy Meyer, member of the Con-
cert Committee, commented on the
Beach Boys, saying, “Many of the
innovations by the Beach Boys are
unknown, as is the excellence of
their recent music. They were the
first rock group to ever use the
Moog synthesizer. They were the
first group to own a record com-
pany exclusively for their own pro-
duction (long before Apple was
born.) They are presently the big-
gest selling American group ever.
They are being brought to the
University because they are able to
offer the best in both the old and
the new music.”

Livingston Taylor has been on the
road four or five nights a week

Director Reveals Plan
For Room Preferences

By TOM NOVINGER

Miss Judith A. Judy, Director of
Residence Halls, has announced the
procedure and the areas available
for room selection for the next
school year.

The selection will be a two-step
Xorocedure: the drawing of a prior-
ity number on April 12 and the cho-
osing of a room on April 19, 20, or
21. In order to draw a priority
number, a student must appear
personally, present his 1D. card,
and already have paid the $100
with his re-enrollment agreement
to the Registrar’s Office.

The areas available for room
selection “are basically the same as
last year,” although there are a few
changes. In Swartz Hall, B Wing
will again house women, but the
rooms will be doubles as they are
for the men in A Wing. The lounges
“will be returned to normal use in
D Wing.”

New Dorm will house men in the
»center section, as well as in the
wing where they are presently
housed. A few additional spaces
have been created in the center
section. Throughout both wings, the
large double rooms on each floor
will be converted into triple rooms
and four lounges in each wing will
be used as double rooms.

Larison will house upperclass
men, as well as some freshmen,
and part of the first floor of Harris
Hall will be an upperclass women’s
area.

Carey House room selection al-

ready has been conducted by the
Language Department, so rooms
may not be selected in this area.
Two other houses, Leiser and
Hulley, will not be available for
room selection. They will be held
in reserve in order to accommodate
men or women, in one or both
houses, depending on the number
and sex of the unhoused students
after room selection.
According to Miss Judy,

Frosh Begin Paper
Recycling Campaign

By STEVE WATT

An ecology drive, headed by
freshmen Hoabie Swan and Al Bor-
acci, has begun this spring to help
start the recycling of used paper.
The ten students working on the
drive, all freshmen, are collecting
old newspapers, magazines, and
computer cards.

Freshmen have been requested
to leave the items outside their
door for pick-up every Tuesday
and Thursday. The paper is taken
to the physical plant and stored
until a “sizeable load” is accumu-
lated, which is then transported to
Williamsport by trailer truck.

Minkin Industries, 1315 West 3rd
St., Williamsport, pays $5 a ton for

Referendum Proposed

ABS Rejects Ratification
Of People’s Peace Treaty

At Wednesday night’s meeting,

that James’ fame has generated
Livingston’s career; however, this
is not entirely true. Livingston be-

an eagerness and warmth in con-
cert. “I want people to come into

Roberts Hall Disciplinary Committee
Sets Up 24-lr. Visitation Guidelines

By GINA SMITH

Acting upon the March 17 dorm
antonomy decision of the Associa-
tion of Bucknell Students, the dis-
ciplinary committee of Roberts Hall
resolved Thursday night not to take
action against individuals observing
24-hour open dorms.

Their statement reads as follows
‘We, as the disciplinary committee

Majority Report Recommends
(ne Year Mandatory Phys Ed

By BILL WHITNEY

The majority report of the Sub
Committee to Review the University
Requirement in Physical Education
was submitted to Dr. Wendel I
Smith, chairman of the University
Committee on Academic Regula-
tions, on March 19

The majority of the Sub-Commit-
tee members voted to recommend
that CAR submit the following mo-
tion for faculty consideration: “Be
it moved that the University re-
quire each student to complete
successfully one year of physical
education or to demonstrate a pro-
ficiency in several phy: activity
areas which have “carry-over”
value. This requirement would
normally be completed during the
freshman year and would be graded
on a pass-fail basis. In addition,
students would be encouraged to
participate, on a voluntary basis, in
physical education courses beyond
the first year.”

The proficiency tests would be
determined and conducted by the
physical education departments in
such “carry-over” sports as aero-
bies, archery, badminton, bowling,
fencing, golf, handball, slimnastics,
swimming, and tennis.

CAR is presently considering both
the majority report and a minority
report, issued by three members of
the nine-man Sub-Committee, and
will present its recommendation for
faculty consideration at a later
date.

Members of the Sub-Committee
who comprised the majority were
faculty members Miss Margaret
Peck, instructor of physical educa-
tion; Dr. Paul DeHoff, assistant
professor of mechanical engineer-
ing; and chairman of the Sub-Com-
mittee, Mr. Robert Latour, di-
rector of athletics; Dr. Mel Win-
stead, professor of chemistry; and
students Christine Ellison '72 and
Thomas Rivoire '72.

It was unanimously agreed by
the Sub-Committee that “students

should be encouraged to participate
in physical and recreational sports
which have a continuing value.”
jority report concluded by
s finally the majority
opinion of the committee that this
encouragement can best occur with
the suggested one year program
which the committee views as an
opportunity rather than a require-
ment. It is our hope and expecta-
tion that the program provided by
the Men’s and Women’s Physical
Education Departments will be both
flexibile and challenging.”

naneseceneecocrcocsscnrecoroeooos BY DAVID HAMMER eeeennoed

People seem more willing than not to openly express their opinions
on wide ranges of subject matter, partly because of an increased break-
down in purely local perspective and partly as a result of a growing con-
cern with the ways in which one’s decision affects another’s situation.
And, in order to lessen the potential conflict which one may experience
in confronting different opinions, individuals should understand that
opinions are based on decisions, and decisions, in turn, are based upon
an individual’s experiences.

This hierarchy initially maintains that, indeed, “‘experience’’ character-
izes the lives of all persons, and it warrants that the broadest definition
of experience be understood. In effect, an ‘“‘experience’’ for a person is
something with which one is totally involved at the moment of its occur-
rence. Under this definition, thought, action, interaction and perception
are some characteristics suggested as composing the experimental essence
of life. Isolated ‘‘experience,” then, may refer to everything from read-
ing a book, flying an airplane or walking through woods to awaking in
the morning (or whenever), noticing a robin or eating an apple.

The process of making a decision, too, may be regarded as an ex-
perience because the act involves processes of thought, action, perception
and, possibly, interaction. But decisions are more than experiences in that
they link past exxperience with what will happen following the decision’s
outcome.

For example, if a man is trying to decide whether to marry a certain

We would like an answer to a
number of points. First, should
male tour guides be regarded as
unisex? Second, why must we be
awakened by their rude loud knock-
ing? Third, are the rooms in
Roberts actually representative of
the dorm facilities available to the
entire campus? And lastly, why
are male prospective frosh shown

We would seriously appreciate
answers to these questions, pub-

Question ABS

To the Editor

With the passage of ABS’s recent
motion to deny the application of
the University’s visitation hour reg-
ulations, the ABS has dragged the
student body onto a dangerous new
course

Specific disagreements stem from
the many inclarities offered by a
motion that declares that the de-
cision of dorm hours is not only
outside the jurisdiction of anyone
in the University community, but
that the flaunting of such rules will

eive the tacit approval if not

ing of the ABS.

This attitude seemingly places all
individuals in a quagmire. Students
must question ABS’s credibility in
such reckless bypassing of the ex-
isting operation. JC’s and RA’s are
placed in the uncomfortable position
of having to choose between
“policy” on the one hand and “non-
policy’? on the other. Consideration
of their plight was obviously not

KEEPING ACCOUNT——**TI
A Learning Experience

By CHARLES MUSSMAN

It was snowing the day before we were to leave for the conference,
so we thought that it would be safer and easier to take the plane than
to drive. We disembarked at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport hop-
ing that the National Conference on Student Involvement in the University
would give all of us a fresh insight into the problems which face students
at all universities, including Bucknell. The conference raised more prob-
lems than it solved, however.

When we started to talk with others we found out just how far ahead
Bucknell is. Two guys from St. Procoprious College said that their ad-
ministration had just changed the name of the institution without telling
the faculty or students until three weeks after the legalities had been
completed. The students took a poll, and ninety-five per cent preferred
the old name (I wonder why), but the administration was not impressed.

We also discovered that we are not unique. Bowling Green State Uni-
versity in Ohio, one of the co-sponsors of the conference, is at this very
moment struggling with the creation of a unicameral form of campus
governance—as Bucknell is—and they’re encountering the same problems
and coming up with the same compromises and the same disgusted dis-
satisfaction.

However, we were able to find some places where we could be better.
Dr. Hollis A. Moore, President of Bowling Green, eats breakfast in one
of the student cafeterias once a week. He also has rap sessions at least
once a week in the dorms where students can ask him all kinds of ques-
tions about the administration of their university. Our administration
could open up the communication a little more than it has been. Ad-
ministration serves a supportive function; students help pay the bill.
Don’t they have a right to know what’s going on?

Dennison University has a student on its Board of Trustees as a full
voting member. Roosevelt University is being sued by its students for
the return of a part of their ‘general fee” which was supposed to go for
the upkeep and maintenance of a student union which does not exist! The
Northwestern University student government has established a method
of student evaluation of faculty so effective that they are now working
to get it incorporated into the considerations which determine who receives
tenure.

Eva Jefferson

Saturday morning, Eva Jefferson, President of the Northwestern
Associated Student Governments, spoke on the news censorship. Although
the freedom of the press is guaranteed it seems strange that the media
bas seen fit to alter their emphasis somewhat, and now refuse to give
national coverage to many important anti-war happenings. In Detroit, a
group of Vietnam Veterans got together to tell the nation about the extent
to which actions such as the My Lai Massacre occur in the War. During
this expose (called the Winter Soldier) they also brought up the way in
which they were constantly oriented toward a “gook” mentality. If some-
how human beings, be they yellow, red, black, or white, can be reduced
to inhuman gooks, it is a foregone conclusion that prejudice, suspicion,
and atrocities are much more likely to occur. This might be likened to
the ‘pig’? mentality among many radical groups.

The two points Miss Jefferson raised which affected me most, how-
ever, were philosophical in nature. One was a quotation from Edmund
Burke: ‘‘All that is necessary for evil to prevail in the world is for good
men to do nothing. “The other was her definition of the student leader’s
role: to get the students involved in the “real” world.

In the following panel discussion, Mrs. Audrey Cohen, a member of
the Newman Task Force on Changing Higher Education (HEW), brought
up several major problems facing all of higher education. There must
be systematic ways to incorporate and test new orientations and con-
cerns in today’s colleges. Freshmen deserved to be treated with equality.
Admissions procedures need clarification and revision. The inequities in
financial aid are unjustifiable.

During one of the seminars I attended, “Quality Teaching: A Dream
or Reality—Faculty Responsibility to the University,’ questions were
raised about the whole concept of tenure. If universities were run with
even the most basic business principles in mind, how could they ever
sign a contract declaring that they will not discharge a professor, no
matter how poorly he may perform in the future? Performance should

woman, he may draw upon past memories such as his involvement with
other women (in order to “‘compare’’), along with his immediate, emotional
feelings. These constitute “what has come before.” But he may also
weigh his alternatives by speculating on the potential ‘‘success” of the
marriage. In so doing, he would be wondering ‘‘what will happen” follow-
ing his decision. Likewise, if one decides to play tennis on a given day, he
may either consciously or subconsciously review the quality of his game
of the past few days while simultaneously thinking about his chances of
winning and losing with the opponent. While these examples may tend to
oversimplify, they do relegate the making of decisions as processes which
call upon past experiences and speculation in determining future courses
of action.

Decisions, then, invariably utilize experience, but they also are con-
nected with the formation of opinions in that one rarely holds a sub-
stantial opinion on something unless he has consciously or subconsciously
reviewed alternatives and discarded all but one. In eliminating alterna-
tives, one is, in effect, engaging in the process of decision-making. One
may reflect, therefore, that our opinions are a product of our experiences
in that opinions are based on decisions because of the processes of review
and rejection, and decisions themselves are based on ‘what has come
before’—an individual’s experiences.

While this sequence may seem elementary, and is probably not so
original as this author supposes, it is often overlooked by groups or persons
differing in opinion. No two persons can be expected to initially agree on
everything together, due to their different, unique, experimental back-
grounds. And, consequently, one should perhaps have second thoughts
before labelling this ‘right’ and that “wrong” without an earnest pooling
of ideas and viewpoints. Clearly, at the outset, this should not be a world
of extremes.

Dateline: The Campus

By STEVE SHEDD

Jennifer Dohrn, Weatherman leader, sister of Bernadine, and former
student at the University of Chicago, spoke at the University as reported
by a March 12 issue of the Chicago Maroon.

The main purpose of her visit was to inspire support for the up-coming
anti-war demonstrations in May. Plans include a May 1 meeting of the
SCLC mule train marchers from Kent State and other demonstrators at
a farm outside Washington D.C. On May 2 they will present the People’s
Peace Treaty to President Nixon and Congress. Plans are to surround
the Capitol until Congress discusses it. According to Miss Dohrn “We're
going to have to destroy this government and all it’s institutions. It’s
going to be a real spring offensive.”

Racial tension at the University of Pittsburg has still not subsided.
The March 22 issue of the Pitt News related that on Friday March 19 a
racial conflict between black and white staff members at the campus
radio station forced the closing of the station. At the printing of the March
22 issue the station was still not broadcasting.

The March 12 issue of the Albrightian, Albright College’s newspaper
reported that Professor Robert Lifton of Yale had spoken there. His talk
was on “Living In Atrocity.” Lifton had studied the effects of the bomb
on the survivors at Hiroshima and found that people had difficulty com-
municating the totality of destruction. One survivor stated “My body was
all black, people were dying. I told my self it was the end of the world.”

Lifton felt the atrocity at My Lai was acted out by men who had lost
their bearings. He described Vietnam as dull. “‘GI’s have no roots, only a
shadow of an enemy, but no concrete contact with the enemy. They de-
velop a sense of guilt for surviving and a sense of hate for the South
Vietnamese people because of the corruption they find.” Lifton concluded
by stating that atrocities can only be stopped when people face them, in
all their aspects of the incidents, denying nothing.

taken. Too, parents of students and
prospective students must wonder
as to what type of living experi-
ence exists both in theory and in
practice. The present proposal
offers no mode for such determina-
tion.

In short, the ABS, by adopting a
rule such as this, holds itself up to
ridicule by the entire University
because 1) despite the seeming
righteousness of the idea of in-
dividual freedom, the measure
doesn’t offer a constructive alter-
native to existing visitation policy
shortcomings; for example, the es-
tablishment of the living units, right
to determine hours and with the
added provision for living space (a
couple of halls or whatever the “de-
mand” dictates) under the present
system of visitation hours for those
who so desire it. 2) The ABS pro-
posal effectively sidesteps existing
issues and rules and fails to repre-
sent the interests of the student
body taken as an entirety. 3) It pre-
cludes the opportunity for discus-
sion and meaningful dialogue be-
tween students and administration
towards the resolution, compromise
and/or conciliation. 4) The ABS
action provides a dangerous pre-
cedent of non-action in the face of
real issues and 5) which by its very

be the criterion for continuing employment. It is disgusting to think that
the same .ousy professor can go on turning off students for years, and
yet, because he is on tenure, nothing can be done, yet that is exactly
what happens all too often. Why aren’t professors’ salaries scaled accord-
ing to the quality of their teaching? Why aren’t professors required to
take courses in teaching? The fact that one is brilliant does not neces-
sarily imply that one can adequately impart that knowledge to others.

The most important problem discussed during the conference centered
around the question of how anything cari direct itself unless its objectives
are known. The most fundamental problem with higher education today
(and it is almost universal) is that the goals of these institutions are un-
defined. Before any further steps are taken in any direction, the Uni-
versity must rethink: what is its purpose? What should its direction be?

That night we all went down in the snowstorm to see Chicago’s famed
Old Town. And early the next morning we left the hotel to return to
Bucknell with more problems than we had when we started and a greater
sense of responsibility to see that something is done about them.

Students for Peace
Co-ordinate Auction

By GINA SMITH

An auction sponsored by the
Bucknell Students for Peace will be
held Saturday, April 10 from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. in the Bison. Pro-
ceeds will be donated to the Harris-
burg Six Defense Committee.

Senior Betsy Sandel and sopho-
more Peter Hect are coordinating
the event. Bob Walker, a senior,
will act as auctioneer.

The group still needs donations,
especially old books, records, furni-
ture, clothing, knicknacks, and arts
and crafts. All items can be drop-
ped off at 246 New Dorm, or they
can be collected by calling Miss
Sandel at 1732.

Miss Sandel anticipates earning
a thousand dollars in this venture.
Recently, the Bucknell Students for
Peace sent a $475 check to the De-
fense Committee. This sum repre-
sented the profits from a showing of
the film “Holy Outlaw,” a folk con-
cert, and the Feb. 28 forum featur-

was defeated.

It was then decided that a refer-
endum should be held “in which
all members of the University com-
munity, as individuals, be asked
within the first two weeks of April
to consider and vote on the ratifica-
tion of the argeement.” The ap-
proved motion also said “It is
understood that organizations as
well may consider and ratify the

At this point, in obvious disgust,
Doscher rose, told the body that he
was resigning, and walked out. At
this time, the ABS has failed to
receive a formal written resigna-
tion from him.

The referendum will be held si-

In other business, a plan con-
cerning the possibility of installing

proposed by Tom Wells, would have
necessitated students accepting re-

possibilities of making long distance
calls at any hour through direct
dialing or extending the University
operator’s hours. Students would
thus be permitted to accumulate
phone bills on their room exten-
sions, and accepting incoming col-
lect calls.

A plan for co-residential living by
alternate rooms, was introduced by
Pais. He specified that all dorms
need not be structured in this fash-
ion — some may also be co-ed by
alternate floors. A committee con-
sisting of Pete Holmes, Jeff Hassel,
Russ Pais, and Janet Russo was
appointed to look into the issue.

Constitutional amendment intro-
duced by Chuck Resnick concern-
ing the publicity committee was
adopted. It stated that the com-
mittee would be composed of liv-
ing unit representatives, thus re-
leiving a publicity director of the
burden.

It was voted to abolish the lec-
tureship committee, in that its func-
tion was now performed by the co-
operative funding committee. A
conference committee was set up
in its place to gather information
concerning conferences to be spon-
sored by the University.

Because the computer cards can be

they can command a higher price.

the drive, Swan said that “it will
be continued until the end of the

Love Story

By DAVID HAMMER

Someone once said that ‘“‘a best-
seller is a gilded monument to a
mediocre talent,” and nowhere is
this maxim more evident than in
Paramount's celluloid production of
Erich Segal’s notorious Love Story.
Basically, the movie exactly paral-
lels Segal’s work, and that may be
wherein many of the film’s flaws
lie. In addition, though, “Love
Story” (at Sunbury’s Strand for a
three-week run) substantially lacks
as an aesthetic offering: craftman-
ship which other, recent films have
noticeably mastered is almost to-
tally absent in this production.

The content of the movie, as in
the book, rests largely upon the
“romance” (with all its old-time
and incongruous connotations) be-
tween a poor Radcliffe girl, Jen-
nifer Cavilleri, and a rich Harvard
boy, Oliver Barrett IV. The couple,
played by Ali MacGraw and Ryan
O'Neal, meet, fall in love and marry
despite the obvious rift between
their social classes. As the audience
struggles along with the couple’s
trials (the cutting off of Barrett
money) and jubilations (the boy’s
admittance to law school and the
marriage’s success, among others),
it supposedly grows with the pair.
And the reality of the girl’s death
hits many viewers, in the end,
faster than they can pull out an-
other pack of Kleenex.

But this viewer found no such
growth with MacGraw and O’Neal;
instead, one sensed a lack of depth
in each of the two characters. The
film projected stock types with no
real personalities of their own, and
the actors themselves did little or
nothing to enhance the contrived
roles.

Ali MacGraw projected a paper
image which became only slightly
three-dimensional with the utter-
ance of a few unoriginal obscenities,
her role in “Goodbye, Columbus”
was proof that she could have done

a more able job than she did.

Ryan O’Neal fared a bit better
in that his facial expressions and
acting style seemed to eminently
suit one’s image of an upper-class
rich boy reacting against his par-
ent’s values. Generally, though,
both actors were chained to “sch-
maltzy” character roles, manipu-
lated to evoke soap-opera tears for
who knows what reason, which
made for a film destined for rec-
ommendation by such periodicals as
the Reader’s Digest. Therefore,
there was little either could do to
remedy their fate.

The best performances were
turned in by the supporting actors,
notably Ray Milland as Oliver Bar-
rett III. Perhaps this is because the
audience saw them for only mo-
ments at a time and was not forced
to take them in large doses as was
the case with the two leads.

Much of the editing of ‘Love
Story’’ was choppy and lacked suf-
ficient transitional devices to lend
aesthetic appeal to the film. And
Henry Mancini’s score consisted
of the title theme’s repetition
throughout the movie. While it oc-
casionally changed tempo, it was,
at times, inappropriate to the mood
created by some scenes in the
script. But, because the theme is
both “catchy” and overly-genti-
mental in sound, people will no
doubt remember it (as they will
the movie) — sensing a richness
which is not actually there.

Despite the film’s considerable
faults, however, some devices and
scenes were worth commending.
The foreshadowing of Jenny’s death
at the movie’s start and its con-
comitant flashback allow the viewer
to concentrate more on the happi-
ness of the couple than on the
tragedy of death itself. And, had
the characters been a bit more
“Jifelike,” such a device would have
surely been effective.

Interlude scenes, which do not
ordinarily depend upon dialogue and
character development, were e€x-

cellent in this film. The couple’s
frolicking in the snow and Oliver’s
playing in the ice hockey game
were visually and entertainingly
successful. Unfortunately, scenes
like these were the exception rather
than the rule

Judging from the dearth of pro-
and con- criticism on the film,
“Love Story” is a movie which one
does either love or hate. Indeed, if
one enjoys viewing ‘‘soft’”’ charac-
terizations performed with medi-
ocre style, occasionally sloppy edit-
ing, a weak, repetitious score and,
generally, trite substance — and
yearns to see a film which six
major studios turned down — ‘Love
Story” is a definite “must.”

Fantasia
By DAN MARTIN

To say that this weekend’s movie
at the Campus Theatre in Lewis-
burg is a feature length Walt Dis-
ney cartoon is, while true enough,
an enormous understatement. The
film is Fantasia and constitutes
what I would call the high point of
Disney’s long career.

Made in 1940, Fantasia is a mas-
terpiece of visual creativity, a sym-
phony of sounds and images. From
the introduction of Leopold Stokow-
ski and the Philadelphia Orchestra,
through the seven or eight pieces
performed by them, all eyes are
focused on the screen while minds
are wondering whether the visions
are actual or dreamt; whether
they’re Disney’s or our own

The introduction into Fantasy-
land is provided by Bach’s Toccata
and Fugue in D Minor, accompan-
ied by a multitude of flowing, wrig-
gling patterns of lines and forms;
brilliant colors which pour from one
side of the screen to the other, out
into the audience and far into the
distance. Dramatic bursts of light
pulsate along with the changing
musical tempos and culminate in
a breathtaking display of swirling
clouds and a flaming sun.

A normal, everyday Walt Disney
flick? Hardly. And so far only the
hors d’oeuvres have been tasted,
with a multi-course dinner yet to
come.

Bach is followed, no less impres-
sively, by Tchaikovsky and the
Nutcracker Suite, with a cast of
dancing animals and vegetables
who are quite often hilarious and
always beautiful. Among the eight
outstanding sequences are the rol-
licking Chinese mushrooms which

closes with the Waltz of the Flow-
ers, autumn fairies open milkweed
pots to set free their seeds.

Disney’s creativity continues as
he presents Dukas’ Sorcerer’s Ap-
prentice, who turns out to be,
amazingly enough, good old Mickey
Mouse. Our favorite rodent gets
himself into his most classic dilem-
ma, as he experiments with his
powerful master’s wand, only to
bring on a sea of angry water and
hopping mops in yet another bril-
liant array of colors and move-
ments.

In the remainder of the film,
Disney turns a bit more serious as
he presents Stravinsky’s Rite of
Spring and depicts, in none other
than a stupendous manner, the
birth of the Earth, with red molten
lava, boiling gases, and swirling
seas. Nature, or the return to it
is again his subject in the paradise
he presents in Beethoven’s Pastoral
Symphony. Disney has created in
this sequence a utopian view of
our world based on the Greek myth
which I consider the highlight of
the entire film.

emotions in Moussorgsky’s Night
on Bald Mountain, followed by the
simple peace of Schubert’s Ave
Maria.

Given the amazing content of this
film, the degree of imagination and
creativity, and the seeming depth
of meaning involved, it is a bit of
a puzzle why Walt Disney’s sub-
sequent thirty years provided the
public with scores of Doris Day,
and Hayley Mills flicks, and count-
less sentimental animal stories. Per-
haps it has to do with his amazing
genius for getting rich, but from
his cartooning alone, not repre-
sented by but culminating in Fan-
tasia, I must consider Disney an
artistic genius as well.

Salaries and Recruitment Drop

Placement Office Reveals Absence of Jobs

By STEVE WATT
Dr. Irwin, director of this Uni-
versity’s Office of Personnel and
Placement reported recently that
the number of companies schedul-
ing campus recruiting visits this
down 10% from 1969-
so noted that 30% of the
companies have dropped or cancel-
led their visits to the campus this
year, compared to a 40% national
average
“Many companies have no open-
ings, but recruiters come anyway
in case there should be a sudden
change in their company’s needs,”
Dr. Irwin said. Greater numbers of
lified applicants and fewer jobs

College recruiting activity is con-
tinuing at a greatly reduced level
at the mid-point of the current
season. But, in terms of inflation,
there may be encouragement in a
checking of the upward spiral of
the starting salaries being offered
college graduates.

Drop In Pay

The rise in beginning salaries,
usually at the rate of 5% to 6% per
year, had continued unabated dur-
ing the past decade. However, this
year it’s different.

At the bachelor’s level, only one
curriculum realized a gain of 3% or
more in dollar value since the close
of the last recruiting season. In-
dustrial engineering went up 3.3%
to $877 per month. Last year the
largest percentage increase in the
comparable period was 8.5% for ac-
counting. This year the accounting
increase since June was 1.7% to
$850.

Three curricular recorded aver-
ages slightly below last year’s
closing figures — business, $717;
marketing and distribution, $676;
and the chemistry-mathematics-phy-
sics group, $794. The remaining
bachelor’s curricula covered in the
ongoing study experienced modest
incre s ranging up to 2.9%.

Highest Average

Chemical engineering at $928 con-
tinued to command the highest
dollar average at the bachelor’s
level, followed by metallurgical
engineerin $890, and mechanical
engineering at $886.

category held up better than most

season was 3% below last year’s
closing figure. Although known to
be a slow st r, last year at this
time its dollar average was 4%
above the close of the previous
season

MBA candidates with a technical
undergraduate degree still received
the highest average offers at
$1,075, although this was a drop
from $1,112 in June. Chemical engi-
neering majors were next at $1,055,
a gain of 1.8% over $1,036 in June.
MBA candidates with a non-tech-
nical background had an average of
$1,018, down from $1,044 in June.

At the doctoral level, there was
insufficient volume reported to
draw any meaningful or valid con-
clusions

Data for this study by the College
Placement Council, limited to male
students, covers actual offers made

by business and industrial firms as
submitted to February 16, 1971. The
Council issues three men’s Salary
Survey reports a year—in January,
March, and late June—and a report
on women’s salary offers in July.
No Improvements

In terms of volume, the figures
in the current Salary Survey report
failed to indicate an improvement
in the situation depicted in the
findings of a special Council study
conducted in December. The al-
most 1,000 employers responding in
the December study indicated they
planned to make 21% fewer campus
visits and to hire 23% fewer college
graduates than last year

National Economy

“Obviously, the downturn in the
nation’s economy, resulting in sub-
stantially reduced employer needs,
is a primary reason for the size-

able drop in the number of offers
recorded thus far,” a Council
spokesman stated. “But another
and very important factor insofar
as the Salary Survey volume is
concerned is the apparent change
in the ratio of offers to acceptances.
Employers have been receiving
such rapid acceptances that they
have had to make many fewer
offers to fill each available position.
There is also the speculation that
a significant number of employers
are holding back on making offers
until later in the spring when the
economic picture may be more
promising.”
Other Side of the Fence

Gone are the days when college
seniors had a multiple of job offers.
“They are on the other side of the
fence:” said Dr. Irwin, ‘they must
now make themselves wanted.”

Commission Seeks Disruption Remedies

By DAN MARTIN

In recent years, American cam-
puses have been in “the greatest
turmoil in all of their history,”
said Dr. Clark Kerr, chairman of
the Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education at its March meeting in
Chicago.

Having proposed adoption of
“Bills of Rights and Responsibili-
ties” for members of American col-
leges and universities, the Commis-
sion’s new report recommends pro-
cedures designed to assure that
dissent and protest on campuses be
expressed in constructive and
in accord with the principles of a
free society

Specifically, the report recom-
mends adoption, campus by cam-
pus, of “‘A Bill of Rights and Re-
sponsibilities for Members of the
Institution,’ suggestin model
pill. Also necessary is the develop-
ment of effective measures for con-
sultation and contingency planning
in the event of disruptive emergen-
cies

sanctuary from the general law,
and thus, must relate more con-
sciously and effectively with the
police than it did in earlier
periods.” Each campus must cre-
ate effective procedures to deal
with cases involved.

One of the difficulties in dealing
with “Campus unrest,” the Com-
mission reports, is that the Ameri-
can public seems to show limited
tolerance for mass protest activi-
ties, even when they are within the
bounds of the law. The group’s
report distinguishes between dis-
sent and disruption and proposes
that responses to events on a
campus be based on this distinction.

Dissent is defined by the Commis-
sion as: ‘Individual or organized
activity which expresses the griev-
ances held against, or changes de-
sired in, society, or a campus, or
both. The activity is carried on
within the limits of the democratic
processes of freedom of speech,
assembly, and petition. Dissent may
be more generalized than around
a single grievance or remedy and
may have an ideological base. It
often includes proposed solutions as
well as complaints.”

The Commission’s report says
that dissent “‘lies at the foundation
of a university,’ and that ‘‘organ-
ized dissent and protest activity
within the law, are basic rights
which must be protected on the
campuses—as they should be for
all citizens everywhere.”

Disruption is defined by the Com-
mission as: “Activity which is not
protected by the First Amendment
and which interferes with the rights
of others. Whereas dissent relies on
persuasion, disruption is based on
coercion and sometimes violence.’’
that disruption ‘“‘is
and purposes of the campuses, and
the processes of a democratic so-
ciety. . . It must be morally con-

| demmed and met promptly by the
| efforts of the campus and, when

necessary, by application of the
general law.”
In its review of emergency sit-

| sion found that (1) grievance pro-
| uations on campuses, the Commis-

cedures are often too slow or non-
existent; (2) rules governing pro-
test activities have often been un-
wise or imprecise of both; (3) too
many members of the campus have
been reluctant to give up “the myth
of uninterrupted serenity,’ and
thus too few campuses have thought
through the handling of emergen-
cies; (4) the view that a campus is
some kind of a sanctuary from the
law has been held ‘‘for too long by
too many;” (5) police relations
have been treated on an arms-
length basis that encourages im-
provisation, rather than accepted
as an essential part of campus life,
as they are elsewhere in the society;
(6) and campuses have often failed
to consider temporary closure as
a last resort in situations of clear
danger of violence to persons or
property.

On the campus, the Commission
suggests the appointment of om-
budsmen to handle complaints made
by faculty, students, or administra-
tors informally. If an ombudsman’s
recommendations are not accepted,
the case at issue could go to a
campus hearing officer for more
formal investigation of the facts
before a provisional decision is
reached; a member of the campus
community could bring charges to
the hearing officer. Campuses might
also consider appointing ‘“‘campus
attorneys’ to prosecute cases of
alleged violations of campus rules.

The Commission calls upon the
campuses to reform themselves and
to develop their own rules and pro-
cedures to protect dissent and pre-
vent and control disruption.

To this end, they recommend
that members of each campus en-
deavor to agree on a bill of rights
and responsibilities applying equal-
ly to faculty, students, administra-
tors, staff, and trustees. ‘‘Too often,
in the past,” the Commission says
“faculty members have set rules
for the students but not for them-
selves; or trustees have set rules
for the faculty but not for them-
selves. We believe the time is ap-
propriate for certain rights and re-
sponsibilities to be applied equally
ta all members of a campus.”

: Kissling N

By DAVE COULTER

The spring recess means more to
the BU sports community than a
midway break in the academic
rigors; it is a period of change from
the basketball tournaments and
winter athletics to the refreshing
outdoor competition of the spring
sports. The roughest and perhaps
the most exciting of these is la-
crosse. The Jamieson coached stick-
men have a well-balanced and sea-
soned squad who will be strong con-
tenders for the MAC title this year.

One of the outstanding athletes
on the team is Lou Kissling, the
leader of the Bison attack. He
currently holds three Bison records:
most goals in a single game-6,
most goals in a season-31, and most
goals in a career-59.

Last year he received recogni-
tion for his performance when he
was named to the MAC 1st team,
Central Atlantic Conference 2nd
team, and Little All American ord
team.

Lou describes lacrosse as combin-
ing “the roughness of football with
the playmaking of basketball.”

He believes the midfield position
is the “toughest position physically;
a midfielder should be dead at the
end of a game.”

Kissing heads the Bison scoring
attack and explains, ‘Scoring in the
game of lacrosse means a lot of
movement, cutting, accurate pass-
ing, and spotting the open man.
We have to find a good percentage
shot like in basketball except there
are no time limits.”

Lou is aided offensively by his
ability to fire shots at the goal
with either hand. He learned how
to use both hands in high school, |
as ‘“‘in order to be good you have
to know how to use both hands,
or the defender will know how to |
play against you.”

This year hé feels the Bisons are
“sound all over as a team. We |
have experience everywhere, ex- |
cept at the goalie position. There |
are seven or eight good midfielders |
this year, and the defense has all
returned. The key to the team’s
success is our midfielders, if they
play together it will help the team
immensely.”

quality of the Bison midfielders, BU
can be expected to play a “more
aggressive defense” making full use
of the team’s depth.

Lou pointed out the wealth of
senior talent on the team and par-
ticularly: co-captain Kent Kisen-
bauer, who “has been converted
from attack to an All-MAC defense-
man;” Doug Behm, “a defenseman
who is tough to beat when his game
is on;’ and C. J. Sowka, a hard
working midfielder ‘‘who has lot’s
of scoring potential.”

The outlook for this season is
bright, but Lou believes, “Tf we had
had more time to practice we'd be
in better shape now. We could be
really good this year if we can Co-
ordinate things and play together
as a team.

In the scrimmage against Siena
College we had some penalty
trouble and ended in a 7-7 tie. But
we were down 6-3 before coming
back to gain a tie and when de-
pression could have set in we ral-
lied and gained a moral victory in
that sense. We can’t afford any let-
downs this year with our schedule.”

The opposition this year includes
8th ranked Rutgers, Syracuse,
Washington, Lehigh, and F. & M.
The season opened Wednesday with
a thrilling 6 to 3 victory against
Gettysburg, and the Bisons will find
out “how good” they are Saturday
against Lehigh in the first home
game. Lou noted that the ‘‘fan sup-
port really helps, and that it has
been incredible here at Bucknell.”

Looking ahead at the entire sea-
son, the team feels that “the first
objective is to get the MAC title,

everything else is icing on the
cake,” This is Lou’s personal goal
also, for after witnessing the thrill
of winning the MAC title two years
ago, he would “rather win the MAC
than be named to the All-American
team.”

While “having a great time at
Bucknell” the senior lacrosseman
has been majoring in economics
and political science. Although he
does not have a decided vocational

year he plans to go on to graduate

As the challenges and opportuni-
ties of a new season arise the power-
ful Bison lacrosse team should pro-
vide many a thrill for sports en-
thusiasts.

otes Laxmen’s Talents Prender Experiments in

Spring Practice Sessions

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

Spring is the time of the year for baseball, kite flying, and football.
Yes, the Bison gridmen are in the midst of their annual spring practice.

Head football coach, Fred Prender commented that, “I am eagerly
looking forward to this year’s practice. I feel we will be able to find 22
ballplayers capable of making next year a success.”

And even though Prender has 29 returning lettermen he feels that
there are really 22 open positions on the team. However, the upcoming
sophomores will have to compete with the more experienced players.

The coaching staff is taking a good hard look at all defensive back
candidates since this appears to be the main Bison weakness.

Prender stated, ‘‘We’ll be switching everyone around trying different

ions until we are able to field two complete units.” The football mentor
is again striving for two distinct defensive and offensive units so that
he will be able to platoon as much as possible this fall.

Leading the 1971 squad are co-captains John Klenovic, an offensive
center, and defensive tackle Joe DiOrio Howie Burke will be calling
signals again and the Bisons are going to be working hard on opening
their passing game up in order to complement the strong running game.

Spring football only lasts for 20 days but the results of this crash
program will be evident when the Bisons tackle the Citadel in their home
opener this fall.

Thompson Previews Season O’Keeffe and Winings Break Bison
Swimming Records in National Meet

By KEN DOAK

The Bison baseball squad, bolster-
ed by 11 returning lettermen, is
looking towards a winning season.
Although the team won only 1 of 5
exhibition games in North Carolina,
Coach Tommy Thompson said, “I
think for a spring trip the guys did
a good job.”

He is seeking increased run pro-
duction and a tighter defense to
help improve last season’s 7-9 rec-
ord. He said, “Last year we were
hurting ourselves with errors at
key times. We have to strengthen
up the defense.”

The strength of the team lies in
the battery combination. The mound
staff features increased depth,
which is important since the team
is scheduled for 22 games in 6
weeks

Tony Zidansek, who was all-MAC
as a soph before sitting out last
season with arm trouble, has been
throwing well and could be the key
to a strong season

Bill Lane, 2-3 last year, is a hard-
thrower who should have a good
season if his control holds up.

Chris R who

spark the offense. His 415 batting
average and 17 RBIs topped last
year’s team.

The infield is led by shortstop
Mike Marinchak, who has moved
over from third, and Dave Hill,
who returns at first base. Marin-
chak swatted .390 last season, while
Hill hit .278

Sophs Bernie Berninger, a second
baseman, and Steve Eck, at third,
hit well down south and appear to
have won starting positions.

The outfield boasts three return-
ing lettermen, including Captain
Gene Luccarelli in centerfield. He
hit .321 last year and is an excellent
gloveman.

John Rudolph (.340 in 1970) has
the edge in rightfield. Steve Gen-
tino has been shifted from second
base, and is battling Jay Sabatino
for the starting berth in left field.

Coach Thompson seemed general-
ly pleased with his team as he
stated, ‘The desire is there now.
t’s just a matter of putting it all
together.”

If the Herd does put everything
together, they could end up battling
for the MAC crown with Lafayette
and Delaware, who appear to be
the top two teams.

The Bisons open the season on
Saturday with an MAC doublehead-
er at Lehigh. While offering no pre-
dictions, Thompson concluded, ‘“‘we
just hope to get off to a good start.
I think we should have a decent
team.”

O’Keeffe reset his school record

Peace Weekend Benefits “""™ ""
COR Vietnamese Children

By RICHARD HUMPHREY

The University Students for
Peace, in association with concerned
faculty and students, is sponsoring
a weekend of activities on April 16
and 17 to attempt to point out how
the war in Vietnam has interfered
with various aspects of society. The
activities will aid the Committee of
Responsibility (COR).

The Committee of Responsibility
was formed in December, 1966, by
a group of doctors and laymen in
order to bring war-injured Vietna-
mese children to the United States
for medical treatment not available
in Vietnam.

The Committee has a continuing
program for the children returned
to their homes in Vietnam. Entirely
funded by donations from private
groups and individuals, COR is
strictly a humanitarian rather than
a political organization aiding vic-
tims of the Viet Cong and American
forces.

Although arrangements for the
week-end are still in the planning
stages, Philip M. Whithim, faculty

Cone to Speak

Professor James Cone, author of
Black Theology and Black Power,
will speak on “Black Theology,
Revolution, Violence and Reconcilia-
tion” April 7 at 8:00 p.m. in Olin
Science Auditorium.

His other books include A Black
Theology of Liberation and Black
Spirituals: A Theological Interpreta-
tion. His visit on April 7-8 is being
sponsored by the Rooke Chapel
Academic Colloquy.

ae

James Cone

co-ordinator, briefly outlined some
of the proposed activities.

Included in the activities is a
discussion lead by Mary Emeny,
national co-ordinator for the
Peoples’ Peace Treaty.

She is well-versed on the social
and moral implications of the war,
as a result of her experience as
head of a Vietnamese orphanage.

John Balabat, a professor at Penn
State and a representative of the
Committee of Responsibility for
War-Injured Children in Vietnam,
will bring a film entitled “War’s
Children.”” Mr. Balabat has been in
Vietnam on numerous occasions and
will soon be returning for a year.

Other activities include a history
and general outlining of the war in
Vietnam, with a lecture from a
representative of Concerned Veter-
ans speaking of his experiences as
a serviceman in Vietnam.

Dialogue on “Prisoners of Con-
science’”’ will be presented by John
Hogan, one of the Catonsville Nine,
and Helene Michie, wife of a mem-
ber of the Catonsville Nine, now
serving in Lewisburg Penitentiary.

Other topics hopefully to be in-
cluded are discussions concerning
repression of dissent, illegal sur-
veilance, and an inquiry into the
foreign policy implications of the
discovery of oil off the coast of
Vietnam.

Faculty Vetoes ABS Plan
For Conference Committee

By JUNE CAFFREY

On Monday, April 5, the Uni-
versity faculty voted to reject the
ABS motion to add an administra-
tor to the proposed members of
the Senate Conference Committee.

It was also decided that there
would be a special faculty meeting
on April 15 to discuss the possibility
of establishing a Faculty Finance
Committee to study faculty salary
allocation.

Last May, the faculty accepted
the University Senate Document. It
was then turned over to the ABS for
approval. In the period from Sep-

tember to February, the ABS en-
tertained 75 amendments and has
recently completed Stage 2 of the
ratification procedure of the Uni-
versity Senate.

Stage 3 of the ratification pro-
cedure concerns the membership of
the Conference Committee. In the
original Senate Document, the com-
mittee had been composed of ten
members, five from the faculty to
be appointed by the secretary of
the faculty and five from the stu-
dent body to be appointed by the
president and vice-president of
ABS. The ABS had proposed the

Wright Says No Right
Roberts Revokes Open Visitation

By GINA SMITH

On Sunday night, the Roberts Hall
disciplinary committee revoked its
Thursday decision to take “no ac-
tion” against violations of the of-
ficial dormitory hours.

This move marked a return to the
University-authorized hours of mid-
night on weeknights and 2 a.m. on
Friday and Saturday for Roberts
Hall.

Anne Wright, residence director
of Roberts, and Wendy Wenk, dis-
ciplinary committee head, both
stressed that the Roberts action was
not the result of ‘“‘pressure” from
University administrators.

Miss Wenk explained, “A lot of
people, both residents and commit-
tee members, simply realized that

Maharishi’s Disciple

By LINDA DIETRICK

Kirby Lamotte, a teacher of
Transcendental Meditation who
studied with Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi, will speak about Transcen-
dental Meditation on Thursday,
April 8, at 8 p.m. in Olin Science
, Auditorium.

He will present his views con-
cerning the value of practicing
Transcendental Meditation for the
individual and its implications for
social behavior, world peace, and
education.

He describes Transcendental Med-
itation, or T.M., as “a natural,
spontaneous technique which allows
the conscious mind to experience
increasingly more subtle states of
thought until the source of thought,
the unlimited reservoir of energy,
creative intelligence and happiness
within, is reached.”

ternational Meditation Society, a
non-profit educational organization
| «which offers courses in T.M. on
most of the major U.S. campuses,
some 60,000 persons are now prac-
ticing the technique in this country,
and the number is rapidly growing.
Teacher-training programs in
India and the U.S. are presently
meeting demands for instructors.
Several universities, including Stan-
ford, Michigan State, and the Uni-
versity of Colorado, have fully ac-
credited courses in T.M.

Meditators report that it produces
a “deep relaxation and infusion of

Miss Wright emphasized that the
impetus for rescinding this decision
came from individuals both favoring
and opposing 24-hour visitation.
“Revoking the statement didn’t
necessarily mean it was a wrong

decision; the committee just lacked
the power to make such a change,”
she stated.

The residence director related
that she had received complaints
from women, not so much opposing
the decision itself as questioning

Two Frosh Attend Conference,
Consider State Student Lobby

By LINDA CAPUTO

Two freshmen attended a con-
ference held from March 5-7 at
Penn State University, which was
organized for the purpose of discuss-
ing the possibility of developing a
student lobby in Harrisburg.

Tom Wells, president of the fresh-
man class, and Roy Grossman, sup-
ported by the Class of "74 and by
ABS, feel that such a lobby could
represent the opinions of Pennsyl-
vania students, as well as out-of-
state students. In this respect, the
lobby would encourage the passage
of student-supported legislation.

Sixteen Pennsylvania schools
were represented at this confer-
ence. According to Lt. Governor
Ernest Kline, main speaker at the
conference, ‘“‘An effective student
lobby would be beneficial to edu-
cation, students, and to members
of the General Assembly.”

At this conference, a panel of

government officials discussed three
major issues: the desirability of a
student lobby in Harrisburg, the
effect a student lobby could have
on Pennsylvania state legislation,
and lobby techniques.

These officials felt that ‘‘the pro-
posed student group would allow
students to participate at all levels
of state government: legislative, ex-
ecutive, and institutional levels.”

The establishment of an office in
Harrisburg would serve as head-
quarters for student organization.
This office would function as an in-
formation center to promote the
lobby.

The student lobby would also be
a research service. Files and re-
cords on the actions, statements,
and backgrounds of the members

Communities Sponsor Hunger Walk,
Donate Monies to Combat Poverty

By JENNY CHEN

The “Walk for the Hungry” on
Sunday, May 2, emanating from
three local communities, will con-
verge at Davis Gym in a unified
community effort to raise money
for CROP, an organization involved
with the collection and distribution
of overseas emergency aid.

The three-pronged community ef-
fort from Lewisburg, Watsontown,
and the Sunbury - Northumberland
areas initiated by a local Lewisburg
youth group ofter an appeale from
World Church Service. The group is
currently enlisting the aid of groups
throughout Union County.

The Rev. Bruce Knisely, general
chairman for coordinating the walk
from the Lewisburg area, said that
the aim now is to get young people

to enlist in the walk. Each indi-
vidual must secure a sponsor, who
will agree to piedge an amount of
money for each mile of the walk
the walker completes.

“We are aware of the fact that
there is poverty in Union County,
and we are also mindful of the fact
that there are poverty-stricken
people in our area. But, I also feel
it possible that in communities like
Lewisburg people are not aware
of the prevalence of hunger in the
world,” said Rev. Knisely. “The
purpose of the walk is to call at-
tention to this and to bear witness
to the community that we have
some responsibility and that the
young people are sensitive to the
problem.”

The youth group will hold services
in four area churches in the hope

of ‘‘bringing the walk to the atten-
tion of the congregations so that
people of the town will enlist as
sponsors.”

As for the response, “It’s pos-
sible that it would peak at the last
moment. We’re thinking in terms of
hundreds of kids,” stated Rev.
Knisely.

The walk will be held rain or
shine. Tentatively, a type of cele-
bration of achievement will be held
when the groups converge at Davis
Gym.

Money received from the walk
will be forwarded to CROP, part of
the Church World Service, and it
will be used to handle emergency
situations such as natural disasters
and refugee problems and also to
handle long range food develop-
ments in underdeveloped countries.

addition of a member of the ad-
ministration to be appointed by
the president of the University.

ABS reasoned that by having ad-
ministration representation, the
Committee would have a better idea
of whether the Senate document
was going to be vetoed or passed
by the office of the President.

Another argument was that the
Senate is a product of community
effort and the administration should
have a say in its formation since
they will be voting members of the
body.

Professor Spielman voiced the
opinion that if there were to be a
veto, it should be open and not
concealed until the last minute.
Professor Walker added that many
faculty members had worked hard
for the ratification of this document

and did not wish to see it changed.

A vote was taken on whether or
not to add the administrator to the
Conference Committee. The ABS
motion was defeated by a narrow
margin 44-24, as two-thirds of the
members present was the amount
needed for passage.

Those who have staunchly op-
posed the Senate document from
the beginning voted against the ABS
motion, while those who have favor-
ed the idea agreed with the ABS
and were anxious to have nothing
impede its rapid approval

Bob Nachshin, ABS President
“views the faculty’s actions as
regrettable and hopes that the ABS
will effectively prevent an impass.””
If an impass developes, it is pos-
sible that ratification of the Senate
document fay be delayed until
September.

hid Office Provides
Summer Employment

By STEVE KNIGHT

A unique cooperative program ad-
ministered by the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance Agen-
cy and the University Financial
Aid Office will make summer jobs
available to many University stu-
dents this year.

John C. Hayward, of Financial
Aid, outlined the details of the an-
nual project. Officially known as
the College Work-Study Program,
it is funded by the U.S. Office of
Education and allocated by the
University administration according
to financial need.

Undergraduate students who are
receiving financial aid from the
University and/or Pennsylvania
State scholarships, or who have
established financial need but have
not received financial aid are usual-
ly eligible to participate.

The jobs will be in branches of
state, county and local government
social service and other non-profit
agencies in or near the individual
student’s hometown and are re-
lated to the student’s major field
of study and intended occupation.
Most jobs will provide a work week
of 40 hours, and all will pay at
least a minimum wage of $1.60 per

THE BUCKNELLIAN

JOHANNA CRAWFORD

APRIL 6, 1971

The VC, according to the informa-
tion, have taken to dying their skin
black to avoid detection in the
United States. “I knew,” Mr. Nixon
said, “that there was a reason why
we had so many of them. Along
the same lines, the VC have begun
dying their skin white and wearing
their hair long. But we'll put these
people in their place.”

He announced the formation of
the “Home Army,” to be headed by
George C. Scott. Its purpose will be
“to cut a swath a mile wide through
America, if that’s what it takes, to
root out and destroy the supporters
and suppliers of the VC no matter
what privileged sanctuary they are
hiding in. I think the elimination of
Connecticut last week shows that I
mean business.”

Towards the end of the Press Con-
ference, Mr. Nixon, with tears in
his eyes, announced that the most
devious plan of all, has been the
VC's attempt to “create dissension
and diversity in the hearts of the
American People.” He accordingly
announced plans to eliminate any-
one who ‘‘deviates from the norm.
That way we will remain pure and
strong.”

He noted that the only exception
will be the last ten million men
drafted, the “Cripple Corps” as they
are known. “Our brave fighting
men will be allowed to live. Every-
one else is in doubt.”

Vindication

To the Editor:

I feel compelled . . . to adjust the
image of Miss Brenda Gordon, Di-
rector of the Freshman Residence
Halls Program, which I feel was
inaccurately portrayed by the resi-
dents of Roberts Hall. Their letter
gave me the impression that she
is unresponsive to and unconcerned
about the needs of the student, an
impression that is totally misrepre-
sentative of her.

Do these young women realize
Miss Gordon, like: myself and four
other Freshman Residence Direc-
tors, has been interviewing appli-
cants for the J.C. position for the
past two weeks so that it is quite
possible that she was in conference
every time they called? ...

Did they ever walk up to the of-
fices of Miss Gordon or Mr. Jenk-
ins, the Assistant Director? Did they
ever consider making an appoint-
ment to talk with either one?
Since when is Roberts Hall con-
sidered a majority of the University
community? And finally, the most
important question of all, did these
anonymous ladies ever 80 to the
people directly responsible for
tour guides, not Miss Gordon, but
the Admissions Office?

I sincerely believe people should
exhaust all possibilities before writ-
ing a letter which detracts from
someone’s reputation.

Pax,
Chris Schroeder
Residence Director

It’s Spring!
By JACK SCHMIDT

Despite the many predictions that student activism has reached a
low ebb, extensive programs are now being formulated for a new spring
offensive. April and May have been filled with enough events to keep any
frustrated anti-war activist at least as busy as he was last year. How-
ever, the character of the 1971 calendar hints of a much stronger com-
mitment to end the expanding war in Southeast Asia. Organizers are eX-
pecting another outpouring of disgust with the war and are quoting the
oft used figure that 73% of all Americans want “out”? by the end of the
year.

Anti-war groups are organizing around two distinct events, but an
accompanying schedule of local marches may overextend the entire
movement. On April 24, marches and rallies are scheduled in Washington
and San Francisco, sponsored by the Student Mobilization Committee
(SMC) and the National Peace Action Coalition (NPAC). The week of
May 1-7, the Mayday offensive, is planned as a period of militant, non-
violence in Washington, centered around the ratification of the People’s
Peace Treaty.

The April 24 marches appear to be similar to previous anti-war
marches such as those held in November, 1969 and May, 1970. SMC is
the largest student peace group in the country and is calling ‘for massive
legal and peaceful action” on the 24th. These activities are placid enough
to gain the support of dove Senator Vance Hartke (D-Ind.), who said
in a letter to the NPAC: “ ‘the American people, peacefully and massively
assembled, can at last prove that the Peace Movement is truly national—
and that the nation is truly determined to end the war now.”

Newsletters sent out by April 24th organizers fail to give any mention
of Mayday, probably because of the avowed militancy of the latter. May-
day is expecting to be culmination of many local anti-war activities
and the symbolic uniting with Third World forces around the world. The
People’s Peace Treaty, which the ABS has had such trouble dealing with,
will be a focal point of the activities.

People’s Peace Treaty

The Treaty, sponsored by the National Student Association, was
negotiated last year by United States and Vietnamese students (see The
Bucknellian, March 18, p. 2 for text). It essentially represents the present
negotiating position of the Provisional Revolutionary Government and the
program of the popular Front for the Defense of Peace — both Vietna-
mese groups. Following endorsements by student body presidents and
campus newspaper editors, Peace Treaty Committees are being formed
in order to seek additional endorsements from faculty and administration
members. After student governments endorse the treaty, campus refer-
enda have been urged.

The ABS has shied away from any endorsements, but plans to hold a
referendum in conjunction with the upcoming member-at-large and class
elections. Faculty members are also expected to vote on the document.
Certain ABS members have taken the leading role in pressuring for
ratification, and it appears that they would form the nucleus of any Treaty
Committee

To date, the Treaty has been ratified by the student bodies at Florida
State University (by a 5600-400 vote), Roosevelt University, Chicago (4-1
margin), and Wisconsin State University at Oshkosh (3-1 margin). Refer-
enda are planned at Lousiana State University at New Orleans, Bellar-
mine-Ursuline College (Kentucky), University of Texas at Austin, the
schools of the Wisconsin State University system, universities in the
Philadelphia area, and most universities in Ohio. Local groups are also
considering the Treaty, and it has been introduced into the city councils
of Cambridge, Massachusetts and Madison, Wisconsin.

Mayday

The Mayday Collectiv which is coordinating the events in Washing-
ton, maintains that it has learned from earlier anti-war struggles. A need ,
was seen for a concrete, programatic, way to end the war, which the
Treaty provides. Earlier demands of “bring our boys home” and “‘end
the war now’ provided no specific plan for ending the war. “Ratification,”
the Collective says, “encourages millions of Americans to assert their
right to make peace when their government won't do it for them.”

It is important to stress that ratifying the Treaty pledges one “‘to take
whatever actions are appropriate to implement the terms of this Joint
Treaty and to ensure its acceptance by the government of the United
States.’’ With this goal, a week’s activity has been planned for early May.
Briefly, the events can be outlined:

May 1—People’s Assembly, held on farm outside Washington; cele-
bration of signing of the Treaty
May 2—Rally with People’s Coalition for Peace and Justice; join
with National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO); Nixon
given final opportunity to accept Treaty
May 3—
May 4—‘‘Stop the War or We Stop the Government”; rush hour sit-
downs at major highway junctions
May 5—national moratorium on business as usual; encircle Capitol
It is hoped at this point that strikes will be staged at campuses and high
schools across the country, that demonstrations will be held in major
cities, and the civil disobedience will grow.

Unity with Third World forces is being stressed and similar assemblies
are supposedly being planned in Paris, London, Tokyo, Peking, and other
cities. The Collective says, “Mayday is a planetwide distress signal for
every concerned person to get in touch with the life and death struggle
facing Vietnam.”

The international character and commitment to massive, militant
nonviolence are new to the anti-war movement. Demands have widened
beyond those specifically pertaining to the war. With the inclusion of the
NWRO and the SCLC, Mayday also demands a guaranteed annual income
of $6,500 for a family of four and the freedom for all political prisoners.
It remains to be seen if this policy of expanding the movement brings
in added support or much less the issue from that specifically ending the
war.

Commitment

The following was adopted by the Mayday Collective on March 7, 1971.

“Some people will react to this scenario as a significant step
forward in anti-war strategy and tactics; others may think it is “‘old
wine in new bottles.’ Most of us have marched, signed, and been
busted many times already and our exhaustion has occasionally
blinded us to our success. All the years of talking, walking, arguing,
disrupting have finally had their effect. The peace movement really
does represent the people. We are the majority. Now we must pring
our power to bear.

“sisters and brothers who have been in the movement for a
while sometimes become a bit cynical and believe that no single
event or time particularly matters, that the accumulation of our
work and struggle is al! that matters, that it is not courage which
is required, but endurance. In fact, we do need courage; not the
macho courage of individualistic action, but the disciplined courage
to understand the critical period we are in and the political and
personal risks which must be taken, and the sacrifices which must
be made in solidarity with our sisters and brothers in Indochina.”

It is obvious that a much deeper commitment will be needed for Mayday

hibited in 1970. This spring will either focus anti-war
activities on a renewed activism or verify the death of mass demonstra-
tions. The calendar is full, but it is difficult to predict if the streets of
Washington will be. Boycott Coke anyone?

Although mainly state colleges,
state-related colleges, and com-

actively involve private institutions
in this program. Under the direc-
tion of Tom Wells, a letter ex-
plaining the purpose and the re-

sent to schools ‘similar to the Uni-

If the response from these schools
is favorable, a similar conference

tentative.

According to Tom Wells, the
University’s participation in this
project is twofold. ‘‘The financial
status of private universities and
colleges is the primary concern,”
Wells stated. “Second, the educa-
tional aspect of this program may
be of value to students who could

semester for regular credit might
be devised. However, no formal

The physiological changes which
accompany meditation have recent-
ly come under study by a number
of medical researchers. Dr. Robert
K. Wallace at UCLA reported that
in most meditating subjects, the
metabolic rate fell within five
minutes to a lower level than that
of deep sleep.

Distinguishing it from wakeful-
ness, deep sleep, and dreaming, as
well as from auto-hypnosis, Dr.
Wallace calls T.M. a ‘“‘fourth state
of consciousness,’ perhaps similar
to animal hibernation

Other studies have found T.M. to

Poor Weather
Hurts Golfers

By JEFF QUINZER

The golf team’s spring trip turned
out to be more of a “winter jour-
ney’ to quote Coach Brad Tufts.
The team of eight players ran into
the same weather problems that
plagued the baseball squad on their
tour

On March 22, the Bisons lost to
Duke in their first match of the
trip and two days later played the
opening round of the Red Fox Invi-
tational at Tyron, N.C. only to have
the last two da: of the tourney
snowed out. Despite some disap-
pointments in that first round,
junior captain Mark Reddy shot a
78 on the relatively new and dif-
ficult course to place among the
top twenty golfers.

The only other returning letter-
man is Junior Alan Shiffler. The
senior-less team is the youngest and
least experienced of any team in
the past five years.

The competitive experience is
coming fast for freshmen Mickey
Sinkus and George Ferrantelli who
along with Reddy and sophomore
Greg Mordas, were the team’s top
performers down south. Freshman
Ray Douglass and sophs Dan Stetz
and Dave Maier also made the trip.

Lettermen Reddy and Shiffler will
experience a new type of competi-
tion when they play in the first of
five ‘‘medal play’ matches, the
rules of which are quite different
from the typical MAC format.

In the typical MAC match, seven
individuals from each team com-
pete in a hole-by-hole competition.
Each may win one point for his
team by defeating the player on
the opposing team who is matched
with him according to number. The
team’s total strokes are not in-
volved in the final outcome, the
winner is the team that wins the
best of seven individual competi-
tions

In medal play however, the match
is won by the team with the least
number of team strokes. Seven in-
dividuals from each team again
compete but not on a man-to-man”
basis as before. Rather, an accurate

record of each team’s score is kept
and the lowest five scores are ad-
ded to give a team total with the
win going to the team with the
lowest total.

“T think we’re better geared to
that type of play,’ he explained.
“We don’t have the really explosive
golfers that are particularly suited
for the MAC format. We have a
much more balanced team, one
that would benefit a great deal if
total strokes were counted.

“Tn fact,” he continued, “I would
like to see them count all seven
scores rather than just the lowest
five.

“For example, last year in the
MAC Tournament, we finished
third in the count of the five low
scores. If they had counted the
team total of seven, we would have
been first by 10 strokes. Our bal-
anced team has very good golfers
in the sixth and seventh spots. I
hope the MAC changes its rules.”

The team’s first match (away
against Pitt), scheduled for last
Friday, was postponed and the
Bisons will now open against Dick-
inson and Juniata in a triangle meet
at home on Thursday. Spectators
are welcomed and even encouraged
to attend.

Weekend Action

The Big Blue baseball nine open-
ed their season in double trouble as
they dropped both ends of their
season doubleheader opener 1-0 and
4-2 last Saturday at Lehigh. Coach
Thompson severely missed his ex-
pected potent offensive attack.

The Tennis racketeers made it
sixteen in a row as they downed
Pitt, 9-0 in straight sets in an
away match

The Lehigh Engineers ground out
an 87-58 victory over the Bison
track team last Saturday in Me-
morial Stadium. Soph Bob Smith
broke his own triple jump record
with a leap of 46’ 8’. Glenn Mc-
Laughlin and Len Dillinger were
other first place finishers for the
Big Blue.

Lehigh Goals Defeat Laxmen

By KEN DOAK

The Bison lacrosse squad dropped
a hard-fought 7-6 decision to Lehigh
Saturday, considerably diminishing
BU chances of an MAC champion-
ship.

The first period was all Lehigh, as
the Herd displayed poor stickwork
and usually could not clear the ball
when they did come up with it. The
Engineers drew first blood when
John Bassani fired a shot past Bison
goalie Jim Tonges.

Midway through the quarter, BU
evened things on a fast break goal
by Kevin McCabe. He was set up by
defenseman Kent Kisenbauer’s long
clear to Gary Germond, who as-
sisted with a perfect pass over the
middle.

Lehigh then dominated the re-
mainder of the period, and moved
into a 3-1 lead. Kevin Stelljes and
Bassani netted the scores.

Bassani scored again early in the
second period off a pass from Stell-
jes. However, Bucknell finally came
to life, and Middie Curt Torrell put
home a shot to make the score 4-2
at halftime.

The Bisons took control of the
game at the start of the second
half, and an early goal by Germond
off a break narrowed the margin.

Two scores by Dan Nourse in a 3
minute span then jumped BU into
a 5-4 lead. Assisting on the goals

were Germond and Lou Kissling,
who was hampered throughout by
a hip injury.

However, a late third-period goal
by Bassani knotted the score at 5-5,
and triggered a Lehigh rally. Two
more scores followed in the final
stanza, and the Engineers found
themselves protecting a 7-5 lead.

BU again began to press the at-
tack, but had several good attempts
blocked. Finally Rob Worthen nett-
ed a long shot with only 48 seconds
remaining.

In the final moments, the Herd
was all over the field, trying for
the equalizer, but could not set up
a shot as the game ended.

On the positive side, the defense,
led by Kisenbauer, could become
very tough to score on when Tonges
gains experience in the goal. And
the offense has good scoring po-
tential if they avoid the poor passes.

The stickmen will attempt to im-
prove their 1-1 record at home
Saturday when they face F&M, a
10-7 victor a year ago.

Kunstler Speaks May 4;
Students Arrange Auction

By DEAN LANDEW

Defense lawyer William Kunstler
will speak here in Davis Gym Tues-
day evening, May 4.

Kunstler, who was forced to fore-
go a speaking engagement here last
semester due to other commit-
ments, is being brought next month
through the efforts of junior Al St.
Vincent.

In trying to get a job for Kunst-
ler, St. Vincent came in contact
with Kunstler’s law center and ar-
ranged for him to come to the Uni-
versity.

Kunstler is being guaranteed $1000
for the defense fund of the Harris-
busg 6, but St. Vincent said that he
hopes to get more through dona-
tions.

In related activities, the Bucknell
Students for Peace are holding an
auction, raffle and bake sale tomor-
row in the Bison from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m.

According to senior Betsy Sandel,
the day’s activities should raise
$1500, which will go to the defense
fund.

On sale at the auction will be a
Baldwin upright piano, a Philco por-
table television, a bicycle, a 12-
string guitar, furniture, kitchen
utensils, books and records, among
other things.

The raffle is a recent develop-
ment, also stemming from the ef-
forts of the auction’s organizers.
Gifts and gift certificates totaling
between $80 and $90 were solicited
from Lewisburg businessmen and
campus organizations.

Included in the raffle will be ten
gallons of gasoline from Esso, two
pizzas from the Pizza Hutch, ten
tickets to the April 23 Beach Boys
concert from the Concert Committee
and two tickets to ‘“‘The Glass Me-
nagerie’”’ from the theatre depart-
ment.

‘Piers the Plowman’

Four Professors Combine Talents
To Produce Musical Adaptation

By STEVE KNIGHT

The highlight of the University’s
125th anniversary celebration dur-
ing Spring Weekend will be the pre-
sentation of a three-part musical
drama based on William Langland’s
The Vision of William Concerning
Piers the Plowman.

Four University faculty members
have combined their talents to
make the performance possible. The
dramatic conception and text of
this adaptation was written by Dr.
John S. Wheatcroft, professor of
English. The University’s first visit-
ing composer-in-residence, Dr. S.
Thomas Beversdorf, has written the
musical score. Professor of music,
Allen W. Flock, is the choral di-
rector and Dr. Harvey Powers, pro-
fessor of English, will be the poet-
narrator.

Dr. Wheatcroft notes that, “If it
is possible for Langland to recon-
ceive the traditional story of Christ
in fourteenth-century terms, to por-
tray Christ’s passion as a chivalric
pageant, perhaps it is also possible
for us, no less urgent for redemp-
tion in our own country, to share
Langland’s_ vision.”

Functions Threugh Three Organs

. Multi-faceted SIS Provides Aid

By GINA SMITH

Drug, draft, pregnancy, and
abortion counseling comprise only
part of the assistance offered by
the Student Information Service.

Conceived of last spring as “an
attempt to bring underground ser-
vices above ground,” S.LS. now
functions through three main or-
gans: Hotline, an information center
in the Bison, and a contact counsel-
ing agency.

Jack Blyskal, S.1.S. coordinator,
reviews the growth of the organiza-
tion: “A series of films and drug
information reviewing sessions last
spring laid the groundwork for

Kenyon Unveils Past
In Archaeology Talk

* One of the world’s leading archae-

ologists will deliver the third
Charles M. Bond Lecture Monday,
April 12.

Dr. Kathleen Kenyon of the
British School of Archaeology in
London, the international authority
of Biblical archaeology, will give
her first description in person in
America of her recent excavation
of Jerusalem.

Her lecture, ‘Digging Up the
Holy City,’ is open to the public
and will begin at 8 p.m. in Room
102A Coleman Hall.

Miss Kenyon, who will appear
later in the week at the University
of Mississippi, is expected to de-
scribe work on Israelite and New
‘Testament Jerusalem and tell what
archaeology has to say about a
number of features which have
always puzzled Bible students.

These are likely to include a de-
scription of what the “gutter”
through which Jacob climbed to
capture the city of David most
probably was; what “Millo,”” which
the Israelite kings had constantly
to rebuild and repair, may have
been; details of the appearance of
Solomon’s Jerusalem; and whether
or not the Holy Sepulchre is on a

was realized for one main organi-
zation including a number of ser-
vices.”

The Lewisburg pregnancy clinic
opened in November, and Hotline
began operating in early December.
The Bison center, which opened in
February, now compiles and dis-
perses information.

“Our major task was to organize
and update our information,” states
Blyskal. ‘In addition to drug, draft,
and abortion facts, the center’s re-
sources now include airline sche-
dules, maps, the University calen-
dar and cookbooks.”

Providing information when it’s
hard to get as well as serving as a
rumor control center, the backroom
Bison center is open from 6 p.m. to
8 a.m. with telephone number 1346.
Freshman Elaine Silver heads the
center.

Using this pool of information, but
specializing in ‘‘crisis intervention,”
is Hotline. Open from 8 p.m. to 6
a.m. and occasionally in the after-
noons, the Hotline number is 1515.

Twenty-two  ‘‘para-professional’’
student volunteers man the phones.
Two volunteers, a male and a fe-
male, are available throughout each
night. Both the volunteer and the
ealler remain anonymous.

Jon Silver, Hotline coordinator,
recalls, ‘‘At first, there were a large
number of joke calls. However, we
treated them seriously: many of
the trick calls could have been in-
dividuals testing out Hotline to see
if it could be trusted.”

During February, an average of
4.3 calls were received each night.
This peak is attributed to questions
concerning registration, the Chicage
concert, and the February eclipse.
As spring break approached, the
average number dropped to 2.5 calls
per night.

Hotline volunteers undergo a
training period lasting from two
weeks to two months, depending on
how much time is given. Included
are presentations by professionals,
discussions, experience in role play,
selected readings, and familiariza-
tion with phone techniques.

A final examination, conducted
by a student and a_ professional,

completes the “course.” Chuck
Confer, a local minister, gives ex-
perienced advice to the volunteers.

S.I.S. contact counseling service
deals with Hotline phone problems
requiring special aid on a person-to-
person basis. Karen Farnsworth, co-
ordinator of this service, stresses
that these individuals are merely a
lot of experienced people who listen
and oceasionally point out alterna-
tives.

“None of us is a professional,”
she explains. “Although we're
backed by professionals, we recog-
nize the fact that we’re amateurs.
We've compiled a list of referral
sources to help deal with problems
beyond our capabilities.”

S.LS. is an ABS-funded organi-
zation. An eight-man advisory board
includes Blyskal, Silver, Miss Silver,
Miss Farnsworth, and four ‘‘profes-
sionals: Thomas Risch, Dean of
Men; Chaplain James Gardner;
Carl Pepperman, education profes-
sor; and Leonard Smolen, associate

Residence Staff Names
Next Year’s Counselors

By SUSAN PRESTON

Both the offices of University
Residence Halls and of Freshman
Residence Programs have announc-
ed their counseling staff for the
coming year.

A new criteria was used in select-
ing both resident assistants and
junior counselors for women in that
both junior and senior women were
considered for both positions. Until
this year only junior women could
be counselors and only senior wo-
men resident assistants.

Due to the intensive training pro-
gram in which each counselor must
participate, an increased program
in planning this spring. It is hoped
that this move will lessen the time
the counselors will have to be here
in late August before the student
body arrives.

The men on the resident assistant
staff including: Geoffrey Blood,

Michael Daves, Ralph DelCoro,
Richard Dittenhafer, John Furman,
Arthur Helmstetter, Richard Hopf,
and John Larner.

Also included are Glenn Mars,
Stephen Moore, Tarras Onischenko,
James S. Segal, David Shaffer,
Ronald Sheibley, Byran Snapp,
Peter Stover, William Vladuchick,
and Edward Woehling.

The women resident assistants
are Marie Burak, Edith Ditchey,
Heather Entrekin, Constance Evans,
Sharon Gavin, June Heistand, Kath-
erine Kellogg, Trisha Kono, Marga-
ret Yathlaen, Teri Lippenberger,
Katherine Lyon, and Rosamond

On the national level, ABS voted
to support the Kennedy-Javits
calling for a Cancer Program. Th
Bill authorizes Congress
ate 400 million dol

present budget) and a continuing
increase until the budget of one
billion dollars is allocated in 1978.

Secondly, the Bill calls for a
National Cancer Authority to co
ordinate research programs aimed
at the conquest of cancer.

The ABS also submitted a request
to the faculty committee on sab-
batical leaves to limit departments
of ten members or less to having,
no more than one faculty member
on sabbatical leave at any one time.

Finally, it was passed that the
People’s Peace Treaty will be sent
to the Board of Trustees to be put

‘Community’ Ratification of Peace Treaty

On Wednesday, March 31, the ABS voted to in-
itiate a referendum in which “all members of the Uni-
versity Community, as individuals” will be given the
opportunity to express their personal convictions to-
wards peace in Southeast Asia by voting, if those con-
victions are strong enough, to ratify the People’s Peace
Treaty.

The Treaty itself is a direct result of the inability
of the governmental systems involved in the Indochinese
War to resolve the impasse which has effectively block-
ed peace, and the consequent realization by the people
under those systems that massive mobilization of public
pressure is necessary to bring about peace. While parts
of the Treaty pledge an attempt to “insure its accept-
ance by the government of the United States,” it must
be realized that the Treaty is essentially extra-govern-
mental and, hopefully, apolitical. It is not a petition, it
is a treaty of peace. The idea, then, is to allow for com-
prehensive grass-roots support for the Treaty.

Towards this end, the ABS initiated its referendum
for the “community.” The fact that the referendum is
supposed to be community-wide, however, presents some
serious problems.

Exactly what constitutes the University Com-
munity? According to the Cooper Report, the Com-
munity includes not only the student body and the fac-
ulty, but also the administration, the physical plant,

librarians, the departmental secretaries and the
administrative help. In apparent contradiction, how-
ever, only the students (through a ballot-box vote) and
the faculty and administration (htrough a mail vote)

will be given the opportunity to vote in the referendum.
This is unfortunate, for this action not only severely
negates what progress has been made towards the ac-
ceptance of the concept of Community, but also denies
those not allowed to vote the opportunity to express
their convictions, \thereby effectively disenfranchising
them.

Also, consideration must be given to how the re-
sults of the referendum will be used. Apparently, the
National Student Association, in its drive for endorse-
ment of the Treaty and the principles on which it stands,
would use the name “The Bucknell University Com-
munity” in many of \its media advertisements (provid-
ing, of course, that a majority of those voting do en-
dorse it). So not only would the ABS be disenfranchis-
ing a segment of the Community, it would also be mis-
leading the public, the principals in the Treaty, and it-
self into believing that the TRUE Community had rati-
fied it.

While this situation is regrettable, steps might be
taken to rectify it, and any endorsement of the Treaty
should not be nullified on this ground alone. For in-
stance, the ABS could ask the NSA to qualify its defini-
tion of the Community.

Ideally, however, the ABS would speedily modify
its voting procedures and allow for the enfranchise-
ment of the entire Community consistent with its own
definition of that body, and make the hoped-for Com-
munity endorsement more truthful publicly and more
forceful privately.

Calley as Hero
To the Editor:

I am not prepared, nor am I
qualified, to judge what should be
the penalty for Lt. Calley. True, he
is a scapegoat and a victim of an
unjust and inhumane (aren’t they
all?) war, but a man is responsible
for his own actions. The “I was
only following orders’? excuse for
murder does not hold—it’s been
tried before.

Can Calley be serious when he
says he murdered women and child-
ren because the Army failed to in-
form him that the “enemy” was
human? Can the Army pervert a
man’s judgement to this extent?

An even more perverted transfor-
mation is that of Lt. Calley from
murderer to hero. He is being treat-
ed like a hero wherever he goes. I
understand that the record, “Battle

Dateline: The Campus

By STEVE SHEDD

The March 19 issue of The Skiff, Texas Christian University’s
newspaper revealed that Gloria Steinem, a free-lance writer for
McCall’s and many other magazines as well as a contributing editor
to New York Magazine had delivered a speech to an equal in
numbers male and female audience on the topic of Women’s Liber-
ation. At the reception following the lecture Dean Robert E. Neeb
was quoted as saying that Miss Steinem “‘was doing very well con-
sidering she was leaving town.’ Miss Steinem in her speech said
that ‘“‘a women’s ability to bear children was envied by men until
the covery of paternity;’ also “The suffering of women and
blacks isn’t the same but the myths are similar. All of us who aren’t
white males are marked.”

Lafayetts College’s April 2 issue of Lafayette reported on Dr.
Morris Abrams’s (former President of Brandeis University) talk
there on March 30. Dr Abrams’s talk was delivered on the topic of
“Who Reforms What In The University?” The former President of
Brandeis University described the goal of the University as an
attempt “to transmit past knowledge to future generations and to
stand on the frontier of new knowledge.” Abrams quoted Anna
Freud in terming the current student rebellion ‘one of feelings and
not celebration. You are projecting your inner turmoils on the
institutions of the outside world.” He concluded saying “I do not
doubt that the young people of today possess a sensitivity unlike
that of any group of students\ before them. “Ours today have the
same flaws of development as, others before, but they are good,
and they intend well. Perhaps jit is the duty of the wise to listen
to some of the complaints of the good.”

David Dellinger, a co-defendent in the Chicago Conspiracy trial,
discussed American involvement \in IndoChina, the distinction be-
tween force and violence, and F.Bil. infiltration of leftist forces as
reported by Lehigh’s Brown and White March 30 issue, Dellinger
said that the Laotian disaster “exposed America as a pitiless
human giant.” He called for people to indict President Johnson,
General Westmoreland, General Abrams and President Nixon if
Lieutenant Calley was found guilty. \Dellinger threatened at the
close of his speech that “the time has come that if government does
not stop the war, then we must stop the government.”

FOCUS:

Dear Editor:

The ABS has asked students to
ratify the People’s Peace Treaty in
a referendum to be held during the
ABS elections. I think we should
all take a closer look at just what
the treaty says and what it fails
to say in its nine points.

“1) The Americans agree to im-
mediate and total withdrawal from
Vietnam and publicly to set the date
by which all American Forces will
be removed.’ (Nowhere does this
treaty mention the withdrawal of
North Vietnamese troops from
South Vietnam.)

“The Vietnamese pledge that as
soon as the U.S. Government pub-
licly sets a date for total with-
drawal;

“2) They will enter discussions to
secure the release of all American
prisioners, including pilots captured
while bombing North Vietnam.”
(The 16 students who “negotiated”
this treaty have stated that the
American POW’s are murderers
and should be left to die in Hanoi’s
prisons, and there is nothing to
suggest that these discussions will
be more fruitful than the Paris
peace talks or the peace talks in
Korea which have gone on for 20
years.)

“3) There will be an immediate
cease-fire between U.S. forces and
those led by the Provisional Govern-
ment of South Vietnam.” (The
North Vietnamese have never ob-
served any previous cease-fires and
it isn’t likely they will now.)

“4) They will enter discussions of
the procedures to guarantee the
safety of all withdrawing troops.”
(But no provision is made for with-
drawing troops after discussions
begin. In Korea two-thirds of the
U.S. casualties ocurred after the
truce talks began.)

“5) The Americans pledge to end
the imposition of Thieu-Ky-Khiem
on the people of South Vietnam in
order to insure their’ right to self-de-
termination and so that all political
prisoners can be released.” (This
gives the United States the right to
overthrow South Vietnam’s elected

gime.”’ (It is implied that while
discussions are in progress, current
Viet Cong policy will be in effect,
which is to assassinate all civilians
oppositions as was done at Hue,
Dak Son, Thanh My, Tam Bang,
Thanh, Cai Son, etc.)

“8) The Americans and Vietna-
mese agree to respect the inde-
pendence, peace, and neutrality
of Laos and Cambodia in accord
with the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Con-
ventions and not to interfere in the
internal affairs of these two coun-
tries.” (At the present time there
are 50,000 North Vietnamese troops
in Laos. These troops are not of-
ficially recognized by North Viet-
nam and would not be affected by
this treaty.)

“9) Upon these points of agree-
ment, we pledge to end the war and
resolve all other questions in the,
spirit of self-determination and mu-
tual respect for the independence
and political freedom of the people
of Vietnam and the United States.”
(The treaty has done nothing to stop
bloodshed in South Vietnam, and
“in the spirit of self determination”
the treaty has empowered North
Vietnam to set up a puppet govern-
ment over that same country.)

Again I urge all students to take
a good look at this treaty before
approving it.

As Spring blossoms into full
bloom and Summer approaches, the
season of young love is at hand. It

suld seem, according to centuries
oi romance, that this is the time
when vows are spoken and pledges
of life-long love are professed. For
some reason, however, young lovers
at our University are breaking the
sacred heritage of romance, and
“Private Eye” must raise its voice
in protest. We submit to the mem-
bers of our community our humble
request that love not die in
Lewisburg and that lovers every-
where their everlasting
devotion and send the announce-
ment of subsequent pinnings, en-
gagements, or weddings to the

Trackmen Down Dickinson;
Big Blue Golfers Triumph

By MARK KNODERER

The cindermen chalked up their
first victory of the year yesterday
as they topped Dickinson in work-
manlike fashion, 84-61.

The victory was all the more
gratifying because Dickinson ex-
pected to win the meet, but found
Gulden’s legions too much to handle.

The story of the meet was guts.
The Bisons came through when
they had to. Especially in the field
events, where the Bisons outscored
the Indians 46-17, the Herd showed
the results of hard work.

Sweeps (first, second, and third
places) in the triple jump, javelin,
discus, and shot put provided the
cushion for victory. In the discus,
the Bisons placed, incredibly, in the
first five places

Mitch Farbstein led the assult on
the discus, flinging the disc 149’4’’,
and missing the school record by a
foot. Doug Nauman led the javelin

ade with a winning toss of 203’-

as Onischenko heaved the

3/8’ to win the shotput,

and Bob Smith narrowly missed his

record in the triple jump with a
leap of 465 1/4”

The track events, though, pro-
vided some of the more emotional
thrills of the meet.

tick Francel is this year’s cap-
tain, and he showed why by putting
on an inspired and determined
show. In the 880 he completely ran

away from the opposition and won
by over 30 yards in a time of 1:59.9.

In the mile relay he held a nar-
row lead when he took the baton
from John Larner. Dickinson’s Ed
Philipps never had a chance as
Francel blew him off the track. The
relay’s time of 3:28.8 is one of the
best in the MAC’s at this point in
the season.

Tom “Doc’”’ Haggerty was another
stalwart for the team, as he placed
third in the mile (4:39.4) and won
the grueling 2-mile in 9:51.0, both
his best times.

In the 440 Dickinson’s Terry Tay-
lor sprinted out of the blocks and
held a 10 yard lead after 220 yards.
Then freshman Glenn McLaughlin
turned on his blazing speed, passed
Taylor, and won in 52.4. Paul
Hermle also nipped Taylor at the
tape to take second place.

The meet was won on team depth,
as the Bisons won nine of the seven-
teen events, placed second nine
times and third twelve times. The
meet was the initial win for track
coach Arthur Gulden, and if wins
are measured by desire, it should
be the first of many.

The cindermen will next test their
mettle tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
in Memorial Stadium against Dela-
ware. The Blue Hens have a tough,
well-balanced team, and the Bisons
will have to be at their best to beat
them.

and Harrisburg Polyclinic.

During regular league competi-
tion, Bucknell compiled a 7-5
record, making this the third
straight year the team has finish-
ed their season with better than a
500 mark. In the other two years
of the league’s existence, Bucknell
finished the season with records of

3 and 10-4.

Graduating senior members and
an expanded league next year mean
that the club will be looking for
new members to keep the team in
good standing.

The Bison linksmen opened their
season with a masterful stroke by
downing Dickinson 5-2 and Juniata
7-0 in a triangular meet held yester-
day at the Bucknell golf course.

Mark Reddy, a junior, put the
golfers ahead by taking a 4-3 de-
cision from his Dickinson opponent
while going one up against Juniata.

Soph Dan Stetz, playing in the
number four slot, and freshman
Mike Sinkus, playing in the number
five slot, shot the lowest rounds of
the day for the Bisons registering
well-coordinated 78’s.

Greg Mordas and Ray Douglass
followed with 79’s while Mark
Reddy (80), George Ferrantelli (82),
and Dave Maier (84), closed up the
scoring.

Coach Brad Tufts was more than
satisfied with his team’s play and
stated, ‘“‘The scores today proved
that on any given day, anyone of
our members is capable of playing
the best round. We really have a
balanced team.”

Bison Netmen Continue Streak

By JEFF QUINZER

The Bison tennis team rolled to its
second win of the season and ran its
unbeaten streak to 17 games over
the past two years as they defeated
Layfayette at Easton by the unusual
score of 744-14. Due to the cold,
windy weather and because the out-
come of the meet had already been
decided, the final doubles match of
Jim Cummings and Bruce Kevan
was called a draw after two sets
with each team being awarded a
half point.

“The windy weather made things
very difficult,” explained Coach
Craig Reynolds. “I was pleased with
the play under the conditions
though. Its tough to get in proper
position when its windy; you move
to where the ball should be when
you look up, its not there.”

The poor spring weather plays no
favorites and the tennis squad has
been hurt by the weather as much
as any Bison team.

“We haven’t had the chance to
really see how well we’re capable
of playing,” said the first year
coach. “You have to play a differ-
ent type of game in this weather;
you have to be more careful. We

Lions Leap Past Diamondmen

By KEN DOAK

The Bison nine dropped their
third straight low-run game Tues-
day, as they lost 41 at Penn State
in a snow-abbreviated contest.

The Herd outhit the Nittany Lions
7-5, but losing pitcher Bill Lane
walked 8 batters in his 4-plus inn-
ings.

BU jumped into a first inning lead
as Chris Riley singled, Mike Marin-
chack reached on an error, and
Steve Eck delivered the run on a
base hit.

In the third, Lane walked the
bases loaded with two outs. How-
ever, he fanned the next batter,
and the Bisons were seemingly out
of the inning as Riley rolled the
ball back to the mound.

However, the umpire ruled that
Riley had not held the third strike,
and the Lions ended up with a run
despite a heated protest.

They picked up 2 more runs in

BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA —-————

Suggests Professor Representative
Brandon Favors Student Trustee

By ROBIN BITTERLICH

In a contact lecture last week,
Dr. Arthur Brandon, a member of
the University Board of Trustees,
expressed his opinion that there
should definitely be some sort of
student representation on the Board.

Brandon was being questioned on
the advisability of having students
choose the Board of Trustees. He
said, “I don’t think it is sound to
have students elect the Board, but
they should have some form of rep-
resentation.”

Although Brandon did not clarify
this statement with specifics, he did
show an interest in attempting to
increase the ties between the Uni-

versity community and the Board
of Trustees.

In response to this apparent in
terest, Brandon was asked to ex-
press his opinion on the ABS motion
requesting three meetings of 2
Board, of which two would be held
on campus.

Brandon answered that although
New York City was more conven-
ient for most of the present mem
hers of the Board, meetings on
campus would be an excellent idea
He continued, “‘I feel that when we
accept the responsibility to be a
member of the Board, we should
also accept the responsibility to be
on campus.”

Forum Probes Education Goals,
Focuses on University’s Future

By ROBERT WENDEL

“Very little change has occurred
in colleges nationwide over the past
15 years,’ quoted John Zeller, vice
president of business and finance,
from a recent publication entitled
“The Golden Years’ in an open
forum on University priorities held
recently.

Zeller went on to say that since
the activity of the students during
the latter part of this period was
high, it is rather unlikely that the
University would change substan-
tially over the next 15 years.

Wendell Smith, University Pro-
vost, reacted immediately by say-
ing, “If this is true, then higher
education is in big trouble. We may
be lacking financially, but, more
importantly, we might be lacking
educationally.”

The forum also focused on
whether or not the University has
any goals, or whether, in fact, it
should have any hard and fast
goals at all.

Dr. Edward Cotter, assistant pro-
fessor of geology, indicated that
one of the biggest problems is that
since statistically, most students
like college just the way it is now,
a major change might scare off the
majority of those enrolled.

America an ‘Evil Nation’
Asserts Theologian Cone

By CATHLEEN EVANS

“The Black Revolution involves
the tension between the actual and
the possible, between the ‘white
past’ and ‘black future’, asserted
James Cone, from Union Theologi-
cal Seminary in New York City,
when he spoke here last Thursday.

He went on to state that, “The
culture and life styles of blacks
must be decided in terms of their
reality, rather than the reality
which enslaves them. The black
community must accept the re-
sponsibility of defining the world ac-
cording to its ‘open possibilities’.”

Noting that traditional Christian-
ity has been identified “primarily
with the structures of power and
only secondarily with the victims of
power,” he sees white Christians in
America as thinking of ‘love as an
absence of power and reconcilia-
tion as being indifferent to justice.’’

As there is “no white theologian
who has taken the oppression of
black people as a point of departure
for analyzing the meaning of the

gospel today,” nor could there be
he advocates a Black Theology,
which, as does Black Power, has
liberation for its theme.

“God, according to the Bible, is
known by what he does, and what
he does is always related to the
liberation of the oppressed.” He
tells American theologians to re-
consider German theology in terms
ot LeRoi Jones, Malcolm X, or the
Black Panthers.

“Black Power seeks to change the
structure of the black community—
its thought forms, values, and cul-
ture. It tells black people to love
themselves, and, by so doing, con-
fronts white racism with a mode of
behavior inimical to everything
white,’ comments Cone, adding
that, ‘““America is an evil nation,
and black people have known that
for a long time.”

The question, however, is no long-
er between good and evil but be-
tween white and black, slave and

(Continued on Page 3)

In answer to this point, Dr. Gene
Chenoweth, professor of political
science, stated, “Higher education
has evolved to now occur in a
gerrymander fashion; this type of
development, can, and, in some
ways, has been very detrimental to
the educational experience. ”

“Probably the biggest problem is
the fact that college is too depart-
mentalized. We need a greater co-
operation between members of the
University community. The curricu-
lum should be more ‘wholistic’ in
approach, with a ‘merged’ faculty.”

When questioned further, Cheno-
weth went on to describe what he
considers to be the first step to-
ward making the University more
wholistic

“The freshman year should be
three-fourths ungraded, where in-
stead of taking courses per se, the
student would be taking what would
amount to being 12 credits worth of
freshman seminar, plus one course
which would be necessary to the
student, according to his probable
course of study.”

Chenoweth felt that this kind of
experience necessary to make
college entirely different from high
school, while, at the same time, it
would give the freshman an overall
view of what education is all about.

Smith then interjected the idea
of ultimately making all four years
like the freshman seminars and,
possibly, only requiring the student
to go three years to get his degree.

During the talk, Zeller outlined
the history of the University since
the turn of the century, and came
to the conclusion that public senti-
ment and alumni gifts reached a
peak between 1955-1970. He went on
to make it very clear that the fu-

as well as 5 additional seniors who

ture of American universities will
not be an easy one.

“Some private institutions are
simply not going to make it through
the next five years. A quick ex-
ample is the Brooklyn section of
L.LU., which is projecting a deficit
of $7,000,000. over the next five
years. It simply can’t compete for
students when right across the
street is C.C.N.Y

Zeller did not feel that schools
with the reputation of the University
would be forced to fold, although
there will definitely be some belt-
tightening necessary. An example
of such cutting back here at the
University is the $700,000. reduction
in the cost of the Student Center—
at the expense of the completion of
the fourth floor.

Expert Shows

Purpose, Benefits of Meditation

By G. PETE!

“Transcendental
philosophy, but a t nique used to
attain aspirations.’’ stated Kirby
Lamotte, disciple of Maharishi Ma-
hesh Yogi, when he spoke last
Thursday night.

In essence, everybody is really
searching for the same thing. La-
motte explained, for all people wish
to expand their horizons ard liimits,
whether it be in a spiritual way
through God, or in a material way
through money

“We are all searching for more,
no matter what it is we seek,” he
stated. In this sense, all humans are
similar and, generally speaking, the
expansion of consciousness is a
common goal for all.

However, our outward quest be-
gins by an inward search, and, in
this sense, transcendental medita-
tion plays an intergal role.

It is a method by which we can
realize the very essence of our be-
ing. ‘Before we have a thought, we
must have consciousness, and an
understanding of the self,’ said La-
motte.

Why then do we meditate? Medi-
tation is a preparation for activity.
It is not involved with aestheticism
or any type of cult activity, but it is
something which all people can use
to their advantage.

Transcendental meditation deals

University Stocks
By JACK SCHMIDT

As we move through April, it is becoming more evident that no mean-
ingful action will be taken on the issues of corporate responsibility. Tomor-
row night’s ABS discussions on Campaign GM will mark the first public de-
bate on the issue. It is questionable what effect a student government reso-

e on the trustees if it is passed in the present vacuum of

ation by other groups. (It is the trustees who make the

decisions concerning votes or proxies). The faculty missed their chance

when last week’s regular meeting passed without a word concerning

e. The only alternatives now open to the faculty are a referendum

special session, since the regular May meeting will be held after
consideration of the matter by the trustees.

High adm ation officials have been noticably silent and may be
attempting to quietly evade the issue. Without any pressure from campus
likely that the trustees will be in any hurry to change their
year’s support of the General Motor’s management. Neither
Charles Watts or John Zeller seem to be willing to forcefully plead the
case of Campaign GM. Watts has visited Detroit as a guest of the GM
management, and his support of insurgent consumer-led proxy fights must
be considered doubtful.

Hunger Walk
To the Editor:

I’m writing in response to the
“Hunger Walk” article. I have the
greatest admiration for the people
who have organized the march.
However, I feel that there is a
great need for the funds in our own
country. The American Indians,
children of the Appalachian region,
and the poor of our cities and rural
areas are going hungry each day.

I have driven through areas of
the South and West where families
of five or more are living in shacks
that the people of the Lewisburg
area would hesitate to put their
tools in.

I realize that helping people of
other countries seems to have taken
first place. It does seem hard for
the people of the United States to
accept the fact that children of this
country live on one meal a day in
some areas.

I ask that all or part of the funds
raised be used in our own country.
We should look to our own country’s
needs before feeling responsible for
the rest of the world. We must not
go on feeding the rest of the world
and let our own people go hungry.

Grace and Peace!
Sincerely,

DAVID'S GOLIATH

Announcing a ‘Student’ Union

By DAVID HAMMER punnnnnoe’

The Bucknellian has learned that the soon-to-be-completed University
Center has undergone drastic changes.

It had been determined that the new structure would house various
administrative offices, cafeteria services, and automated vending machines
(thus spelling the demise of the Bison). Recently, however, an informed
source in the Administration denied the granting of these space allotments,
and further suggested that the University Center would, instead, consist
of a concert hall, various recreational facilities and ample student lounges,
among other things.

The source also indicated that the building would be known as the
“Student Union” in order to compensate for the proposed alterations.

Generally, then, the Student Union will perform a totally different
purpose from that of the University Center. It seems that the building
will be operated specifically for students—and at least three reasons were
announced which account for the change of heart by the Administration.

First, the Administration was persuaded that the students have long
needed a suitable and appropriate place to congregate for concerts, strikes,
and similar routine occurrences in this University’s social life. And it was
evidently felt that, since a building was being constructed on campus, it
might as well be the one used for such events.

Second, it was felt that a new cafeteria and Bison-substitute would, on
the one hand, eliminate lines of persons waiting for meals and, on the
other, standardized food service. Thus, students would be denied the op-

wr

portunity for complaining about having to wait in line and the unique ex-
periences of enjoying various degrees of Bisonburgers from uncooked
(rare) to shoe-leather (well-done). Such denials would, unfortunately, go
against University tradition, one source remarked.

Third, because of economic uncertainty, many Administrative posts will
be eliminated by tember 1972 when the structure will supposedly be
completed. Therefore, it was felt that new Administrative offices would
not be needed and, consequently, other purposes for the building under
construction were promptly considered. The students evidently won in the
deliberations for once.

But the undergraduates here must show that the Student Union will
be well used, according to another highly placed Administrative source.
The lounges and concert hall shall remain only if frequently patronized.
Other wise, lounges will be converted into dormitory rooms. (thus sup-
posedly curbing the predicted housing shortages) and the concert hall
will be turned into a full-time practice court for the varsity basketball
team; Andy Meyer’s concerts will, subsequently, be moved to Trax Hall
lounge so the national badminton tournaments may be held year-round in
Davis Gym (thus making Lewisburg a world-wide sports capital and ful-
filling the Athletic Department’s greatest dream).

It is clear, then, that the students have been given a vote of confidence
and a test in the form of a building all their own — ‘‘one small step for
students. . .”

A Look through My Window

By RICK VANCE

It was early evening as I headed for my room. The
dimly lit strip of pockmarked macadam that separated
the academic and nonacademic worlds was blanketed
in the silhouettes of tall oaks and parked cars, as
though recuperating before another day’s pummeling.
The night hid the avenue’s wounds beneath shadowy
bandaids that betrayed themselves only to my feet,
and as the old redbrick dormitory that functioned as my
academic home came suddenly into view,

counting my footsteps.

Forty steps brought me to the junction of Davis
Avenue and Mitchell Road where I turned the corner
and glanced at the window of my fourth floor room.
The room was brightly lit, and I wondered if the ac-
quaintance I had made one week earlier was watching
my approach and playing the game I had played so
often. Using the leaves of the tree outside my window
as peripheral knives I had cut the passersby into sliv-
vers by adjusting my line of sight. Head, torso, legs. I

“Both,” he admitted, startling me, I hadn’t expected
him to concede this point so readily. ‘‘Plus,’’ he con-
tinued, ‘“‘they’re troublemakers. Look at Philly. Look
what they did there!”

“That’s Philly, not here. You mean you know what’s
causing your prejudice and you still won’t change?”

“Fear is fear,” he said. ‘“Just because you know
why you fear a lion doesn’t mean you're not gonna fear

an ideal merging: the rugged body of one of the town’s
steelworkers with the head of a fellow student. But
such opportunities were rare, for the townspeople gen-

erally avoided the campus.

When I arrived at my room hardhat Chuck Fletcher
was sitting at my desk, staring out the window. He was
wearing large, steel-reinforced boots, dungarees, and
a heavy brown coat that made his shoulders seem even
more massive than they had appeared one week earlier a

“That’s past tense! You can’t go by that!”

“So what? Having blacks in your town will benefit
you in the long run.”

“Just like it benefitted Philly. Hell, we can’t give

contact energy resources that will
allow us to act so much more ef-
ficiently?

Thus, contact with the field of
being is a preparation for action.
The concept of apathy and non-ac-
tien often associated with medita-
tion are misconceptions which have
been mistranslated from Eastern
thought.

The idea that one must renounce
the material for the spiritual is
wrong. The duality of spiritual and
material which has divided us in
our present society can be unified
be meditation.

Transcendental meditation inte-
grates one’s active life with one’s
spiritual life, because, through med-
itation, one can act more efficiently.

Lamotte concluded by explaining
that one of society’s problems lies
in the constant efforts to solve our
problems through social and eco-
nomic institutions.

“This is fine only to a degree, but
we must get to the individual, for
the atmosphere of a country is a
reflection of the inner condition of
its individuals. We must learn to in-
tegrate our technological advance-
ments with a knowledge of our-
selves,” Lamotte explained.

In its normal state, our nervous
system is enlightened, but, as a re-
sult of external tensions and anxie-
ties, its degree of efficiency has
been damaged, and our potential
for action has been lessened.

Stated Zeller, ‘Tuition is going to
keep rising until the student quota
of the University can no longer be
realized.”

What then? He was asked what
the chances were that this school
would become a state school. In
response, Zeller stated quite em-
phatically that the opportunity for
such action was unlikely so long as

In conclusion, Mr. Zeller felt that
“so long as there is a place for the

its classrooms. However, we do run
the risk of becoming a very elitist
institution, with only students who
can personally afford to come

He calls violence “what white

says, ‘Violence is American as

even if it means death.

The Delaware track team dealt
the Bison cindermen a stunning 90-
55 defeat la’ aturday. In a meet
which would have been much closer,
few Bisons duplicated their recent
performances due, in part, to the
cold and windy weather and the
letdown after the big win over Dick-
inson last Thursday.

Coach Gulden had counted on the
strength of his distance runners
and the field events to overcome
Delaware’s strength in the sprints
This strate. did not quite work
out, as Blue Hens actually out-
scored the Herd in the field events,
lost marginally n the distance
events, and cleaned up in the

Delaware had three sprinters

and Carlos Williams who swept the

swept the 120 high hurdles, won the
mile relay, and placed 1-3 in the
440. In these six events the Bisons
were outscored 43-3.

In the longer distances things
went a little better. ‘“Doc’’ Hagerty
and John Larner placed 1-2 in the

Stickmen Rally in
Battle with F&M

By ALAN GROCHAL

In a game not to be long forgot-
ten by BU fans, the laxmen de-
feated Franklin and Marshall in
sudden death overtime 10-9, Satur-
day.

Behind by as many as two goals
on several occasions, the Bisons
came storming back time after
time and tied the score for good,
with only 53 seconds remaining in
regulation play on a goal by Kevin
McCabe assisted by Lou Kissling.

The Herd then battled F & M
through two-four minute overtime
periods without scoring, to send the
game into sudden death. Shortly in-
to the sudden death period, Dan
Nourse put a happy end to the 3
hour marathon game by sending
home a goal assisted by Kissling.

Co-captain Kissling displayed out-
standing ability to set up team-
mates. He garnered 6 assists, as
well as scoring a goal himself. The
Bisons’ 9 assisted goals gives an
indication of their excellent team-
work.

Since Franklin and Marshall en-
tered the contest undefeated, the
victory was especially sweet for the
laxmen who are now 2-1. This win
should give the Herd impetus for

their next two games at Syracuse
and Rutgers.

Rutgers began the season as one
of the top ten Lacrosse teams in the
nation, but recently the Scarlet
Knights have lost to Army and
Adelphia.

Encouraging is the fact that the
Herd outshot F & M by over a 2 to
1 margin. In last week’s loss to
Lehigh, the Bisons were slightly out-
shot by the Engineers.

Individually, Franklin and Marsh-
all’s goalie, Steve Revell, was very
impressive with many outstanding
saves. For BU, Curt Torrell and
Kevin McCabe each contributed
two goals.

Bison Goalie Jim Tonges had a
rough afternoon with only 7 saves,
but this can be partially accredited
to F & M’s few number of shots.

Midfielder Curt Torrell felt that
Franklin and Marshall was a better
ballelub than Lehigh. ‘“F & M used
a great variety of plays and man-
aged to find the open man very
well.” he remarked.

Lou Kissing, who was subpar for
the Lehigh game, was virtually
100% for F & M and his good health
could spell trouble for the laxmen’s
future opponents.

Chris Riley: Herd’s Hard Hitting Cager

By DAVE COULTER

Although Bucknell has not at-
tained the reputation of being a
major athletic powerhouse, the
cover of the NCAA 1971 Baseball
Guidebook displays the figure of a
Bison player. This player has hit
448 and .415, placing him 4th and
13th in the nation, in his last two
seasons with the Herd. He has also
been co-captain of the Blue basket-
ball squad; he is of course senior
Chris Riley.

While this year’s baseball squad
has a slow start, Chris holds high
hopes for a successful season. He
explains, ‘This year’s pitching is as
strong as I have seen it at Bucknell,
and the hitting is strong throughout
our first eight positions; together we
should have an effective Bison nine.

“We have had a schedule prob-
lem,” Chris relates. ‘“‘This year
our MAC games are at the begin-
ning of the season and we haven't
had time to warm up yet. I think
that we could have defeated Lehigh
later in the season. The weather has
also been bad; at Penn State it
snowed the whole game and that
was extremely adverse to hitting.
However, we have at least shown
signs of making contact with the
ball; they just have not been fall-
ing in.”

therefore I am more at ease with
it. I have had to work harder at
basketball to produce.”

As to future Bison basketball pro-
spects, he predicts, ‘‘The next two
years in basketball will be among
the best Bucknell has ever seen.
Coach Smith has been able to rte-
late to the players, and they will
go further than ever before. With
Carter, Kerr, Darnall, Donovan and
Greenwood the Bisons will have a
good shot at the MAC title.”

Commenting on recent criticism
of Coach Smith, Chris said, “I was
at first a bit wary of Coach Smith,
but in my junior year and especial-
ly my senior year, I feel Coach
Smith gave all the ball players a
real fair deal. He didn’t try to rule
their lives and they had a chance
to play as they wanted to.

“There was criticism about play-
ing a slow game in the Bucknellian,
but Coach Smith did not specify a
slow game against Delaware. It was
the individuals’

a fast break and good shot offense,
but we didn’t have the experience
to run and shoot.”

“J was really disappointed in our
basketball fans this year. They have
treated the basketball team unfair-
ly and have let the team down. I
think Coach Smith is as adequate a

coach as anyone could ask for. If |

Bucknell could become a basketball
power. Our fans have only shown
their triteness by their lack of sup-
port.

“In the last home game (where
the Bisons were heavy underdogs to
Rutgers), I felt the spirit of the
crowd for the first time and that
was probably one-half of the reason
we did so well. The fan support was
forcing us to play well.”

Chris has “really enjoyed’ him-
self here and plans to attend law
school next year unless he “gets a
baseball contract attractive enough
to make me accept it.’’

While the baseball Bisons have an
uphill battle to fight if they are to
be in the running for the MAC
crown, they have, in the eyes of
their catcher, the talent to “‘do the
job.” All that remains is for the
team to jell and for the power of
Chris Riley and the Bison sluggers
to begin to take its toll. Hopefully
the Bisons will discover the magic
which will allow them as a team to
utilize their talents toward their
goal of a successful MAC season.

New Class Officers Faculty Appoints Black

The Association of Bucknell Stu-

for vice-president Rod Edwards
prevailed as he tallied 109 votes
against his opponents Steve Boyer,

Shannon Becomes Professor, Advisor

“Tf a black has the security of
knowing who he is, then he does
not necessarily need a black setting
in which to affirm himself,” stated
David T. Shannon, who has received
the faculty appointment of associ-
ate professor of religion, effective
this July

He will serve also as an advisor

sociation of Blacks for Progress.

Shannon received his A.B. from
Virginia Union University in 1954,
his Bachelor of Divinity from Vir-
ginia Union School of Religion in
1957, and his Master’s Degree in
Sacred Theology from Oberlin Grad-
uate School of Theology in 1959.

He is presently working on his
dissertation in Wisdom Literature
for his Doctorate in Sacred The-
ology at Catholic University of
America

Under the auspices of the Ameri-
can Baptist Convention, Shannon
served as the East Coast Director
of Higher Educational Services as
consultant on black studies for a
number of small liberal arts col
leges.

He has served as co-ordinator of
a conference on black students of
small universities at the University
of Chicago in 1970, through the
American Baptist Convention. He
has also spoken at several schools
on the topic of black studies.

In an appearance on campus last

People’s Peace Treaty Fails to Secure
Student Body Support by Shim Margin

By ROBERT WENDEL
News Analysis

Why did the People’s Peace
Treaty fail to gain student support
here at the University? Probably
the first question which should be
asked is what is the treaty. Judging
from the comments made to this
reporter, most people didn’t even
know what they were being asked
to ratify.

Shapp Signs Senate Bill
For Scholarship Monies

Gy LYNDA ROSCOE
On April 2, Governor Milton J.
“Shapp signed into law Senate Bill 18
to provide $25.7 million to fund
second semester state scholarship
grants.

In addition, $527,000 to bolster the
state student loan fund and $500,-
000 for matching money to procure
federal work-study grants were ap-
propriated as part of the bill’s
measures.

The funds had been delayed for
approximately two months due to
inaction in the State Senate and
House of Representatives.

Early in March, when the funds
had not yet been granted, Governor
Shapp asked that the 87,000 state
scholarship students at the 1400 in-
stitutions involved be extended

He asked that the institu-
tions resist proposals to force these
students to pay their bills or leave
school.

Processing of the scholarship pay-
ments has already begun. Dr. John
C. Hayward, director of financial
aid, reported that the school had
recently received a check for a
lump sum of $116,153 from the Pen-
nsylvania Higher Education Assist-
ance Agency. This amount covers
grants for the 300 students here re-
ceiving PHEAA assistance during
the current semester.

He noted that the process, for ap-
proving grants for next year has
begun. The deadline for applications
is May 1.

Hayward explained that if the
money is a able, award notices
will be received in June, although
he said that in all probability, they
will be delayed until August.

The major points of the treaty
were as follows: 1) ‘The Ameri-
cans agree to total withdrawal, and
to publicly set the date for such
withdrawal”. Discussions (will en-
sue) to guarantee the safety of
withdrawing troops, and secure re-
lease of all military prisoners;

2) ‘Americans will pledge to
stop imposing (the Thieu govern-
ment) on the people of Vietnam,
and the Vietnamese will form a
provisional coalition government to
organize democratic elections, and
enter into discussions to guarantee
the safety and political freedom of
persons who cooperated with either
side in the war;”

3) Both countries agree to respect
the independence of Iaos and Cam-
bodia.””

As can be seen the document is
not very specific, however, it is
also not very radical in nature.
However, many people on campus
found it too objectionable to ratify
(the vote was 571-534 against the

Grateful Dead Concert Creates
‘Insistent? Crowd Outside Gym

By TOM NOVINGER

A “religious, almost mystical
following” was the major cause at-
tributed to the gathering outside
the Grateful Dead Concert Wednes-
day night.

The crowd consisted of approxi-
mately two hundred people, “non-
students,’ who became “noisy and
insistent’ after the concert began.

According to Andy Meyer, chair-
man of the concert committee, the
group was nonviolent; there was no
property damage and it was not
necessary for the State Police to be
called.

Although the group was denied
entrance to the concert because
they did not possess tickets, they

could have bought them in the
ticket office.

Meyer said that the group was
finally admitted to the concert only
after he realized that “the problem
wasn’t worth risking. . . . I don’t
believe in violent confrontation.”

He offered two reasons for the
crowd’s behavior. Several possessed
counterfeit tickets, a problem with
all concerts, and became angry
when they were not permitted en-
trance.

Meyer added that the “particular
nature of the dedicated following of
the Grateful Dead” also contributed
to the disordered behavior. They
were “something only the Dead
could bring.”

against the treaty did so on the
basis that either the document was
of no value in terms of really being
able to accomplish anything, or,
that the treaty was so full of
‘holes’ that it was impossible to
agree with it.

As one girl put it, “I read the
document, but it is simply all emo-
tionalism, with no rational or clear
thought. I also don’t think the
document had a real purpose—it
simply meant to stir people up.”

Campaign GM Discussed

ABS Urges Support
For Nader Proposal

By ERIC RIESS

The Association of Bucknell Stu-
dents acted on two fronts last
night to press the University trus-
tees to make large corporations in
the United States acknowledge their
social responsibility.

The ABS passed motions request-
ing the board to vote the Univers-
ity’s stock in General Motors and
the Gulf Oil Company, in favor of
changes proposed by Ralph Nader
and the United Presbyterian
Church.

Nader’s motion, nicknamed cam-
paign GM round I, will be voted on
at the May 21 GM_ stockholders
meeting. The proposal has three
mair points.

The first would ‘transform the
now closed selection of directors
into a real election simply by re-
quiring GM to list on its proxy
candidates nominated by  share-
holder petitions; only candidates
listed by management are listed
there now. All shareholders thus
would have the opportunity to make
meaningful nominations and to
choose among opposing nominees.”

The ABS motion proposed by Torn
Leonard, a representative of Tra:
Hall, continued, “the second pre
posal would give three of GM's
most important constituancies—con-
cumers, dealers and employees—i
voice in GM’s decision making pre
cess by permitting them to partici-
pate in the selection of GM direc-
tors.”

The third proposal would require
GM to publish hard statistics on its
progress in pollution control, safety
and minority hiring.

According to Leonard, “The Uni
versity has 6869 shares of GM stock
and even the President doesn’t
think that anyone in the adminis
tration will press the trustees for
action on the matter, so it’s. up t
the students.

Leonard continued, “It’s the duty
of the students to press this issue
and we should.”

The trustees meeting is planned
for early May.

The second motion passed by the
ABS asks the trustees to vote the
University’s shares of the Gulf Oi

Dateline: The Campus

By STEVE SHEDD

Maine’s Senator, Edmund Muskie, possible presidential candi-
date in 1972, delivered a speech at the University of Delaware as
reported by that school’s April 5 issue of The Review.

Muskie said, “Freedom of information is the foundation of a
free society. The party must restore the trust and confidence which
the Nixon Administration has undermined bit by bit.”

The New England Senator cited as an example the Cambodian

Invasion.

“The Administration went into Cambodia to destroy

enemy headquarters. The headquarters were never found.”
He also cited the Laos invasion, “Next they went into Laos to
plock the Ho Chi Minh trail until the rainy season in May. They

were driven out

The Administration claimed a great victory in
Laos. We can’t stand many more

‘victories’ like this.’”

He concluded by saying that the President tells Americans to
elaborate on what’s right with America. Muskie believes that the
right to report what is wrong is what is right with America.

Right Up Our Calley

By DAVID WEINBERGER

Isn’t it all really clear? Calley murdered an entire village (a village,
incidentally, declared to be friendly). He did so on orders. He lined people
up in a ditch and then shot them. He is guilty of murder; we should also
realize that he does not bear the guilt alone. No one likes to see a scape-
goat suffer, even when he is guilty.

But he has become a hero in America. Is he a hero because he
followed orders even though those orders went against everything America
“stands for: justice, individual rights, a helping hand?

Or is it that America now explicitly stands for orders instead of
justice? The Sanctity of orders. Calley is a hero because a heroic act is
one in which a person is ready to sacrifice himself for something higher.

Calley is a hero because he obeyed orders that were even harder to
carry out than orders which send men rushing through mine fields: he
had to go against his own conscience. In a heroic act, the only thing that
comes out intact is the person’s spirit. But Calley sacrificed even his spirit.
A hero is now one who is brave enough to sin, The Sinners risk Hell, while
to be good brings only reward and satisfaction.

Ordered to do wrong, he bravely turned against his own conscience,
like a Hitler youth turning in his parents. We are now fighting not for a
goal but rather te maintain a rigid process. We are fighting to maintain
orders and order. We are fighting to maintain law; but this law and this
order have no content except themselves. It is good to have laws; it is
good to restrict freedom, but no longer is this being done in the name of

Isolation vs. Exploitation: Foreign Policy

By RON DOCKSAI
Editor’s note: the following is a syndicated column distributed through
the Free Campus News Service. The news service, conservative in its
political stance, is attempting to make inroads into the traditional college
press service field presently dominated by leftist groups.

rich - became our nation’s extemporizers of foreign policy, man

fact that economic ties abroad boost the prestige of the United States in
the community of nations are either discounted or bypassed in the com-
pany’s stockholder’s report with limp references to “helping all the world’s

people with the gift of progress.”

Even the ‘Nixon Doctrine,’ which is
really the Kissinger doctrine, suggests an isolationist blueprint as if any
reference to America’s having responsibilities abroad, as

Athens, means sending American boys to foreign shores.

place but helped many Africans in establishing their own outlets and
business trade centers. (If, however, Senator Kennedy convinces Congress
to economically embargo South Africa in full, the black population is pro-
vided with no alternative save migrating from a country they do not wish
to leave.)

South America is and has been the stimulant of a leftist’s indignation
when choosing to get in heat over U.S. economic policies abroad. In 1969,
when President Nixon asked Governor Rockefeller to go to South America,
the President was not only doing a favor to the people of New York State,
but the Governor actually returned with some interesting things to say.
(See the Rockefeller Report on the Americas/The New York Times edition /
Quadrangle Books/1969/$1.25). Statistics show that not only have U.S.
industries not ‘ripped-off’ South American republics (in fact, our economic
presence led to net increases in GNP and individual income), but our in-
dustries have been and will probably continue to be shy in establishing
new overseas investments in South America. Through President Kennedy’s
Alliance for Progress and the unfulfilled expectations of peasants who were
promised Cadillacs and only received Chevrolets resulted in much of the
current political and economic instability, as witnessed in the election of
Allende and the new style of coup in Peru, South America has a long track
history of social and political anarchy between election days. Such un-
stable environments are not promising for companies that must plan in
terms of long-range investements, and individual countries are not helped
by U.S. companies only interested in immediate economic gain.

No one has all the answers (and only some have a few of the answers)
to the economic and political dilemma South America poses for herself
and her neighbors. However, in the pursuit of solving them in our nation’s

just national interests, Americans should cease apologizing to the world’/

for our prosperity and continued life. There is an unhealthy arrogance in
the attitude of Americans who see the world’s problems, all of them, as
our own invention. Traditionally, Americans have never liked the idea of
exploitation. As our statute grew as a nation with the responsibility of
leading the free world, we agonized with our power and even proved our
unwillingness to establish a Pax Americana, in spite of the suggestions of
Bertrand Russell, during the four year interval after World War II when
we held a monopoly of nuclear weaponry. At the Ford Foundation, men
earn their professional wages by worrying about such things as writing
books to instruct future generations on how exploitative we must never be.
In short, in case you are interested, I hold great faith in our nation’s
ability to prosper as long as we are willing to hold up our veil of tears
long enough to breathe.

Peace Treaty

(Continued from Page 1)

Another student echoed this feel-
ing, “I never read the treaty—but
I read the ad hoc committee re-
port and agreed with what they
said. I don’t really see what good
it would have done to pass the docu-
ment.”

On the other side of the coin, the
two basic motives for passage
were covered by two men. One
simply felt, “Since peace won't
occur through our government, the
citizens of the involved countries.
who are the ones who are doing
the dying, must work to gain the
peace they desire.

The other student simply stated
“It’s simply one more way of ex-
erting pressure on the government,
just as marches and demonstrations
exert pressure.”

Nationally the treaty has wide-
spread appeal. Some of the indi-
viduals who have ratified the treaty

tion in the religion department, say-
ing that, “I feel I will bring the
cultural experience of being black
to the department, as well as a
black perspective to Biblical liter-
ature.

“T think that the intellectual stim-
ulation of the department and its
diversity of faculty members, as
well as the challenging atmosphere
of the campus itself, will provide
many opportunities for intellectual
development.”

When asked how he will apply his
experience as a pastor to his posi-
tion at the University, Shannon re-
plied that, “I see my work as a
pastor in a wider scope - that of
education. Thus, my work in aca-
demic cources and my advisory
capacity to students is an extension
of my past work as a minister, for,
in all of these positions, there is a
questioning process which must go
on.”

Shannon will be teaching Religion
100 next semester, and, during the
second semester of next year, he
will be teaching a course in new
approaches to Wisdom Literature.

Gaining Ground

Cindermen Outdistance Juniata;
Vauman, Dillinger Set Records

By MARK KNODERER

The Bison. track team sped past
Juniata last Monday, 86-59, setting
their third and fourth school records
of the season and evening their
record at 2-2

The win was tougher than ex-
pected due to strong competition
from the Indians, but Gulden’s men
responded with a championship ef-
fort. After eleven events the Bisons
led only 51-44, but 1-2 finishes in
the two high jump, and dis-
cus, and a win in the mile relay
ballooned the lead to 80-47.

The win was also well balanced
as the field event half of the team
eutscored Juniata 38-25, and the
run s scored 48 points to the
Ind 34

Doug Nauman broke the first
record of the meet by heaving the
javelin 206’2’, breaking the old
record by nearly four feet.

Sophomore Len Dillinger was the
other record breaker, as he cleared

Weidler finished

in 4:28.0, and Tom Hagarty followed
in 4:32.3.

The 1-2 finish of Scott Bartram
and Hagarty in the two mile began
the Bison breakaway, and the In-
dians were never in the meet again.

John Larner, meanwhile, won the
880 in 1:58.2, a time which Coach
Gulden noted was a “‘fine effort,
considering he had no competition.”

A Bison 1-2-3 sweep in the 120
high hurdles provided the narrow
cushion which the team held
throughout the meet until the big
breakaway. Steve Dautel, John
Newman, and Bob Smith provided
the manpower.

prove. The mile relay team of Paul
Nermle, John Larner, Glenn Mc-
Laughlin, and Francel lowered their
time to 3:26.8 an average of 51.7 a
man. The 440 relay team has not
won all year, but the Bisons are
getting closer. The team of Rick
Bullock, Steve Aronoff, Bill Hamil-
ton, and Len Clayton finished at
45.0, only a tenth of a second be-
hind the Indians.

McLaughlin and Hermle both had
their best times of the year in the
440, 52.3 and 52.4 respectively. John
Newman had his fastest time ever

in the 440 hurdles. Aronoff and
Hamilton finished 2-3 in the 100
yard dash, and Hamilton placed
second in the 220.

BU Athletes Chosen

Nine Bucknell athletes have been
chosen to appear in the 1971 edition
of Outstanding College Athletes of
America. This year’s selections
were Alex Anderson, Paul Biko,
Rick Francel, Don Giacomelli, Mike
Huffman, Lou Kissling, Gene Luc-
carelli, Glenn Mars and Tom Ri-
voire.

Coaches and athletic directors
from individual colleges across the
nation nominated the winning ath-
letes on the basis of their displayed
abilities, not only in athletics but
also in community service and
campus activities.

Anderson is captain of the tennis
team. He has a three-year singles
record of 28-1 and has won 24 in a
row. Last year the senior was a
member of the MAC championship
doubles team and the A Division
consolation singles winner at the
1970 ECAC tournament.

Biko displayed exceptional leader-
ship qualities in his first year on
the varsity basketball team. He

Broadway

Musical

Rocks Shakespeare

“Your Own Thing,’ a modern
musical comedy version of Shake-
speare’s ‘‘Twelfth Night,’ will be
brought to the University Saturday,
April 24, at 8:30 in Davis Gym.

The tongue-in-cheek, modern re-
telling of the Shakesperean tale of
mixed-up lovers deals with the mis-
taken-identity complications in the
romances of a pair of twins - one
a boy, and one a girl who feels
obliged to masquerade as a boy.

The musical comedy, complete
with New York cast under the di-
rection of Richard Nagel, won the
1968 New York Drama _ Critics’
Circle Award, one of the most high-
ly coveted prizes that any American
stage presentation can hope to at-
tain.

In the thirty-three years that this
award has been bestowed since it
was founded, it has never been
given to an off-broadway New York
production - not even to the ac-
claimed, long-running “Three Penny
Opera.”

Almost every Shakespearean play
has been turned into an opera, but
only four of his works have been
adapted into musical comedy form,
and all have been wonderfully suc-
cessful.

The first, of course, was “Kiss
Me, Kate,’’ based on “The Taming
of the Shrew,’’ which was a mag-
nificent hit, running 1,077 perform-
ances in New York from 1948
through 1951.

The second was a similar peak in
theatrical history — the adaptation
of “Romeo and Juliet’ called ‘“‘West
Side Story,’’ which drew New York-
ers to 981 performances, 1957-1960.

The third, ‘‘The Boys from Syra-
cuse,” based on “The Comedy of
Errors,” ran 500 performances in

Berm Committee Submits
Self-Determination Motion

By LUCY TYRRELL

Changes in residence regulations,
24-hour visitation, and dorm auto-
nomy — Possible? According to
members of the New Dorm House
Council Committee on Self Deter-
mination, who recently drew up a
proposal to effect residence hall
self-determination of visitation
hours, there is hope.

On April 5, this proposal was pre-
sented to "president Charles H
Watts II, Dean John P. Dunlop, the
Office of University Residence
Halls, the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, Miss Brenda Gordon, and Miss
Margaret Peck.

Sometime this week, Affairs Com-
mittee plans to send a report to
President Watts, including informa-
tion compiled about the current
system of dorm operation and visi-
tation hours and also recommended
changes.

Although the New Dorm Com-
mittee feels its document may not
be accepted in its present form, or

may not be the proposal which will
be acted upon, the New Dorm Com-
mittee hopes that the petition will
be incorporated into the larger re-
port to be made by the Student
Affairs Committee and to be acted
upon (in the near future) by Presi-
dent Watts.

The New Dorm Council Commit-
tee want to try to institute a policy
of self-determination for all resi-
derice halls

The Committee bases their pro-
posal on the results of a question-
naire concerning visitation hours
and regulations circulated in New
Dorm in October. Of the 309 resi-
dents polled, 86% favored the pro-
posed visitation hours of 24-hour
open dorms and 82% favored hall
autonomy within the maximum
limit. The complete results are in-
cluded in the proposal for self de-
termination.

The actual document presented by
the New Dorm Committee includes
resolutions for changes both in the

Committees Call for Moratorium May 5

Presidents of the three largest
national student organizations - the
National Student Association, the

national moratorium on May 5 in
support of the immediate with-
drawal of all U.S. forces from Indo-
china.

memoration at campuses through-
out the nation of the killing of stu-

Open Protest Letter

By JUNE CAFFREY

Bob Nachshin, along with more
than 400 other student presidents
and college editors, has signed an
open letter to President Nixon con-
demning his policies in Vietnam
and charging that the Administra-
tion “seriously misinterprets the
mood of both the campus and the
countryside.”

Zietlow Conducts
Training Session

By RICHARD HUMPHREY

Carl Zietlow, coordinator of non-
violent civil disobedience training
for the April-May peace actions in
Washington, D.C., will conduct
an action training session tomorrow
at the Cowan Conference Center
from 2 until 12 p.m. Mr. Zietlow is
sponsored by the Bucknell Students
for Peace.

The session is designed to bring
the participants to an understanding
of the nature and psychology of
civil disobedience by analyzing the

(Continued on Page 3)

The letter attacks the President’s
‘“Vietnamization’’ policy, contend-
ind that ‘‘changing the color of the
corpses does not end the war.”

The statement, released in Wash-
ington last week, is signed by the
largest number of student leaders
to sign such a protest against the
war.

According to a recent New York
Times article, 100 student leaders
sent an open letter to President
Johnson in December 1969, express-
ing anxiety and doubts over the
war.

In the spring of 1967, 200 student
leaders sent a similar letter, and, in
April 1969, 253 student presidents
and editors signed a statement say-
ing that they would go to jail rather
than be drafted, ‘as long as the
war in Vietnam continues.”

Nachshin noted that this last
letter aroused a ‘“‘good deal of pub-
lic sentiment.” Regarding his de-
cision to endorse the present state-
ment Nachshin said, “Hopefully,
efforts by student leaders will bring
forth greater consciousness on the

followed by the local moratoriums
throughout the country on May 5.

Bob Nachshin, president of the
Association for Bucknell Students,
is enthusiastic about the possibilities
for a University moratorium. He
commented that, ‘‘I hope the ABS
will aid the Bucknell Students for
Peace in working in the University
and the community to urge people
to join in a call for a National
Moratorium on May 5

“If there is a cessation of busi-
ness-as-usual at the University, 1
hope this will be a day of serious
activity to show the world that we
cannot continue in a horrifying war
that is polarizing all segments of
our society.”

In a letter to the SMC, Nachshin
stated that, ‘The ABS supports the
efforts of the Student Mobilization
Committee and the National Peace
Action Coalition (the sponsors of
the anti-war marches and rallies
scheduled in Washington and San
Francisco on April 24) and encour-
ages members of the University
community to support their efforts
to prove that the nation is truly
determined to end the war NOW in
a legal and peaceful manner.”

The students sponsoring the na-
tional moratorium state that, ‘We
call for a day of actions which will
involve all forms of non-violent pro-

Students Question Soviets,
Protest Oppressed Jews

By GINA SMITH

Protesting the oppression of Jews
in the Soviet Union, approximately
fifty students silently demostrated
at a lecture given by two Soviet
representatives last Thursday night.

The lecture, entitled ‘Lenin’s
View of Imperialism,”’ was not dis-
rupted by the silent demonstration.
Students holding posters, such as
“Let My People Go,”’ lined the back
and sides of Coleman 102A

Senior Steve Billig, who coordin-
ated this action with Andy Lesser,
explains the motives behind this
action:

Speakers Denounce Penology,
Advocate ‘Prisonless’ Society

By ED MARSTON

“Prison is a place where you lose
your face.”

This was the dominant theme of
a panel discussion on prisons held
Saturday afternoon, sponsored by
Psi Chi, the psychology honorary
society. The speaker was Jack
Cook, a former inmate at Lewisburg
Penitentiary and Allenwood Prison
Farm.

Cook said, “Every institution has
an implicit definition of man, and
you are always standing in relation
to that definition. In prison your
manhood is attacked and you live
as a failure.”

Appearing with Cook was David
Greenberg, author and advocate of
prison reform. Greenberg stated

that progressive penology has been
a failure because it is just another
“mask” for the coersion of the in-
dividual by society.

“Prison is an evil, because it
denies autonomy, degrades dignity,
impairs or destroys self-reliance,
inculeates resentment, fractures
family ties, and prejudices the
prisoner’s future prospects for any
improvement in economic or social
status.”

This occurs, Greenberg said, des-
pite superficial changes in the
prisoner’s standard of living. He
also pointed out that although some
individual acts prohibited by law
are harmless, the most harmful
acts of the last century have been

“First, we realized that having
the two Soviets here presented a
fine opportunity to protest agai
the maltreatment of Russian Jews.
The two Russians consented to
speak here, hoping to report the
mood here on campus. We were
able to demonstrate our strong con
cern for the plight of Russian Jews
to them

“Also, our action served to it
form the University community of
what is going on in the Soviet
Union. Few peopie realize the ex
tent of the oppression against Soviet
Jews.”

Although the Soviets did not re
spond to the protest on Thursday,
their Friday night lecture on the
Five Year Plan was devoted mainty
to the question of Soviet Jews.

The two representatives, George
Isachenko, editor of Soviet Life
magazine, and Eugene Lukyantzev,
second secretary of information for
the Soviet embassy, denied most of
the reports of Soviet Jewish “‘cul
tural genocide.’

For example, they attributed the
closing of all Jewish seminaries
(training schools for rabbis) in the
Soviet Union to the fact that there
is no demand for rabbis today.

When asked why so many Russian
Jews are requesting exit visas, one
Soviet replied jokingly that not only
Jews are trying to leave the coun
try.

Billig explains the Thursday pro-
test as a “spontaneous demonstra
tion within the University com
munity;” although there are numer

At the April faculty meeting, the group failed to approve an ABS
suggestion that one Administrator be appointed to the Senate Conference
Committee. The motion failed, but a general concern could be sensed
that the document be immediately considered by the Conference Com-
mittee. The ABS, in a gesture of community, accepted the faculty’s
insistence that no Administrator be consulted, so that the Senate could
move quickly into committee. The weeks are passing and the FAC has
yet to name its selections to the Committee. They may be trying to stall
the document to death, or at least push its ratification into next year. One
wonders where we first got the idea that we could all work together in
governing the University.

Letters to the Editor |

Elections
To the Editor:

I originally ran for the presidency
of my class merely for the sake of
taking an active role in the election.
I never ran for office in high school
and, as a result, never really ex-
pected to win. However, I was ap-
palled at the way in which the
campaigns were publicized, the lack
of issues, and most importantly,
the extent another individual would
go in order to prevent me, or any-
one else he didn’t approve of, from
winning

Permit me to clarify these
charges. The first and only meeting
of all the candidates occurred on
the Wednesday before the elections.
During this time, we spent less than
10 minutes discussing two essential
issues: the election date, which
originally had been planned for the
next day (or so I understood from
the discussion), was decided upon
and the type of signs allowed was
also agreed upon. When someone
suggested that the candidates have
a debate, the general consensus was
an emphatic no; on the basis that no
one would attend. This would seem
a reasonable assumption for how
could any attendence be expected
on such short notice and without
any publicity?

Then came the campaign and the
main question that faced me was
my policies. I soon discovered that
I had none and, except for the fact
that we all wanted a general im-
provement of Bucknell life, neither
did any other candidates, More dis-
tressing was the realization that

even if a letter was published con-
cerning our policies it would never
be read by 90% of the class. This
apathy is confirmed by the minute
turnout at the polls, the continuing
disgusting conditions that exist in
all freshman dorms and lounges,
intramural un-organization, and the
quality of our food.

Apparently, I had been running
my campaign skillfully enough to
scare someone, though not the other
candidates specifically. Election
morning I was shocked to learn
about some fifteen signs in the
cafeteria calling me nearly every
name under the sun and making
my campaign a joke. These were no
run of the mill signs either; be-
cause they were done with great
originality and effort. What hurt
more than the signs was the sub-
sequent assumption of all who read
them that I had put them up,
personally.

I did not; nor would I ever stoop
so low as to base my campaign
upon the degredation of someone
else. Whether or not these signs
kept me from the presidency is of
little consequence because as I
mentioned previously, the outcome
of this election was not as im-
portant to me as the actual partici-
pation. However, to find that such
people call themselves members of
this university has weakened my
faith in human nature itself

Good luck to Tom Wells, with
circumstances like this he'll need

Upon examining the recent events on campus, I have come to the
conclusion that Bucknell can be broken down into three major groups:

a rather

small contingent of anti-war, anti-governmental politicians

of all—the apathetics.

Also included is that “One floor

According to the proposal, each

of civil disobedience.

The clinic deals with important
questions such as: How do I accept
arrest? What prior provision for
lawyers and bail should be made?
How do I help a member of the
group who is losing his cool under
harassment?

The group attending will under-
take role playing, participate in
socio-dramas, and share in quick-

Zietlow will also bring the latest
information concerning Peace action
plans for Washington, including the
centers opened there for on-the-

Zietlow, a member of the Quaker
medical ship Phoenix which brought
badly needed supplies to Hanoi,
worked for eight months in Cam-
bodia for the Quakers and served
as liason to the North Vietnamese.

Since 1968, he has pioneered the
establishment of non-violent, direct
action training centers. Zietlow has
been frequently arrested and is in-
timately acquainted with all the
problems and techniques of success-
ful direct action.

Speakers

committed by governments, and
these are not illegal.

Greenberg and Cook both argued
for a “‘prisonless” society, rather
than for reforms that merely
strengthen the hand of prison au-
thorities. Greenberg noted that
liberal reforms often advocate
“treatment” rather than ‘‘punish-
ment,” thinking that the two terms
indicate a change in purpose.

“Thus ‘punishment’ is evil and
barbaric, but ‘treatment’ is benign
and progressive. The fact is that
from the offender’s standpoint the
two regimes are identical in most
respects.””

Cook stated that the prisoner can-
not be helped by the prison system,
that one was either on the side of
the prisoner or on the side of the
prison authorities. He said that
prison psychiatry is “‘in the service
of the prison system, not in the
service of science.”

Representatives from Lewisburg
Penitentiary had been scheduled to
appear at the panel discussion, but
they declined at the last moment.

Debby Bustin, National Coordina-
tor of the SMC, stated that, “It is
one year since the historic events
of last May, which triggered the
most massive explosion of student
anti-war activity ever in the history
of the United States.

“The students of this country do
not forget either the murders of
their sisters and brothers at Kent
and Jackson, or the power of our
response to the American invasion
of Cambodia.

“The momentum that is building
around April 24 is cracking the Ad-
ministration-touted ‘lull’ in anti-war
activity on America’s campuses.
We plan to channel this momentum
into massive local moratoriums
throughout the country on May 5.”

It has been urged that those stu-
dents who are unable to come to
Washington help to organize a na-
tionwide cessation of “‘business as
usual’? on May 5, in order to take
the People’s Peace Treaty to their
communities.

The demonstration in Washington
will mass at the Ellipse at 11:00
a.m. At noon, the demonstrators
will march down Pennsylvania

Rider team at home 8-1, Saturday.
Both teams entered the match with

Winners and Losers

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

In what had to be one of the
most lopsided wins ever for a Bison
track team, the cindermen obliter-
ated Albright 124-21, yesterday at
home. Highlights of the meet in-
cluded two school records broken
and sweeps of seven events.

Coach Gulden commented that,
“Albright had to leave several team
members home, but our margain of
victory was so big I really don’t
think that it mattered.”

There appeared to be a marked
contrast between the Coach Gulden
who was at the Albright meet com-
pared to the one who was at the
Lafayette meet last Saturday. Then,

it was the Bisons who were being The

beaten 90-55.
Last Saturday the Big Blue just

couldn’t get off the ground as the

Leaopords swept the pole vault,

high jump, and long jump, as well
at the 220 and 2 mile events. In
those five events the Bisons gave up

40 points while not earning any.

This match should be a big boost of
confidence in the coming matches
whenever the pressure is really on.

Delaware definitely did not run
away with the match. Coach Tufts
commented that, “Our last two
matches were on our opponents’
home courses. This is a definite ad-
vantage when it comes to setting
your ball up in the proper lie when-
ever you are approaching a dogleg

Rinkus Discusses Views on Military

American University Life Vietnam Veteran Returns Medal
To Government in War Protest

By TERRY ELLIS

“Life is very different here; you
can’t really compare it. Here you
have trees and are in the country
where you can show your liberty.
American students are very re-
laxed, receptive, informal.’ So
states one of 23 Belgian and French
students who are currently on cam-
pus for a two week exchange pro-
gram.

The group composed of male elec-
tricians and engineering students
from the Institute Don Bosco in
Tournai, Belgium, is here from
April 18 to 30 to live with and learn
from their American contempor-
aries. This University is one of
nine universities in the country to
participate in the Belgian exchange
program.

Developed by the Experiment in
International Living in Putney, Ver-
mont, and subsidized by the Belgian
Ministry of Education, the program
is designed to promote interna-
tional travel, reciprocal home visits,
and international studies. The op-
portunity for 25 students from here
to visit Belgium at a reduced rate
next January is part of the re-
ciprocal arrangement offered
through the program.

Under the guidance of Professor

Ralph Walker, chairman of the
electrical engineering department,
the students have visited classes
and facilities as well as such com-
panies as Corning Glass Works,
Piper Aircraft, and Sylvania Elec-
tric Company.
*But the students, informal inter-
ests have been considered as well.
Through daily meetings with Jim
Hammerlee, director of C.A., and
Mrs. Ralph Walker, chairman of
the visiting committee, the students
help plan their own schedule. Many
have expressed a desire to attend
the Beach Boys concert, Cap and
Dagger’s production of The Glass
Menagerie, and to audit specific
courses of interest.

They have also challenged the
varsity soccer team to a match on
Saturday, April 24

Since their school is located in a
city, they don’t have the opportunity
for sports, and as one student ex-
plains: ‘‘At school, athletics are

News Analysis
(Editor’s Note: The following arti-
cle) by Nancy Grden and Bill Whit-
ney concerns the hiring of two black
professors, effective next semester.
David T. Shannon will join the fac-
ulty as associate professor of re-
ligion, and advisor to black students.
Richard E. Smith will join as assist-
ant professor of Engliish.)
(Part one of a two part series.)
Last semester, the Bucknellian
published several articles concern-
ing the hiring of black faculty mem-
rs and the development of the

* black studies program. Themes

such as the need for an outside
consultant on black studies, the
difficulty of attracting black profes-
sors to the University, and the hope
that a black professor would not be-
come a “specimen” or “token” on
campus frequently were seen in the
articles.

Four University students, three
black and one white, discussed
separately with the Bucknellian
their personal views concerning the
hiring of two black professors and

school and students in sports.’
Helping the Belgian group be-
come acquainted with American
life are approximately 75 students
serving as hosts and hostesses on
a revolving basis. Through ac-
companying them to meals and
taking part in informal gatherings
such as a Cowan picnic and a
European folksing, the students are
exchanging ideas, answering ques-
tions, and giving the primarily
French speaking students a chance

Jerome J. Rinkus, retired captain,
USAR, in a letter to the Vietnam
Veterans Against the War dated
April 19, 1971, has signified his soli-
darity with that organization by en-
closing his Joint Service Commen-

The medal and commendation,

approved by Gen. Will. Westmore-

his active duty tour in Vietnam in
1966-67. Rinkus, who served with
Army Intelligence in Saigon, said
in his letter to the Veterans, ‘The

Decision Results from Questionnaire

Student Life Committee Recommends Autonomy

By ERIC RIESS

The Student Affairs Committee
has reccommended to the President
that individual living units be given
authority to determine visitation
policy, effective September 1971.

If approved by the President,
Charles H. Watts, each hall group,
small house, or fraternity will have
the opportunity to set and regulate
it’s own visitation regulations.

The report presented to the Presi-
dent this week also proposes guide-
lines for implementation and a sug-
gestion for an Official university
policy statement.

The recommendation is part of
a report, requested by Dr. Watts,
as an evaluation of recent innova-
tions in residential life recently in-
stituted at the University. The com-
mittee will also issue reports con-
cerning co-residential living and
the freshman residence program
later in the semester.

The evaluation of the present liv-
ing situation, was conducted through
a questionnaire distributed to ap-
proximately 2500 undergraduate
with 1682 responding. The results
of the questionnaire indicated that
83% of the total number respond-
iing thought visitation hours should
be extended beyond the present
limits.

Seventy-five per cent of those re-
sponding thought that visitation
should be expanded beyond what it
is now but less than 24 hours.

The report stated, that “By a
proceedure to be determined by
the governing body of each resi-
dence unit, each fraternity and resi-
dence hall may determine its own
visitation policies, including hours.
Each living unit shall be respons-
ible, through its Disciplinary Com-

ABS Recommends
24 Hour Parietals

By JANET RUSSO

Recognizing the importance of
the ‘Report and Recommendations
Concerning Visitation Policies and
Hours,” the Association of Bucknell
Students unanimously requested
that President Charles H. Watts I
take immediate action to implement
by September 1, 1971, the recom-
mendations submitted by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.

The most important proposal con-
tained in the evaluation is that
“each fraternity and residence hall
may determine its own visitation
policies, including hours.” The in-
dividual living units shall also be
responsible, through their disciplin-
ary committees, for dealing with
violations of their regulations.

A necessary assumption that
underlies the committee’s recom-
mendations is the realization that

mittee, for adjucating violations of
the units visitation regulations.”

The report goes on to say, “The
members of the Student Affairs
Committee believe that a uniform
and University imposed regulation
concerning visitation does not nec-
cessarily provide the best residence
environment for social growth and
interaction among students. Ad-
ditionally the Committee believes
that a majority of Bucknell stu-
dents possess the ability to regulate
their lives in a mature and re-
sponsible manner. . .”

In addition the report stated, “. . .
the Committee feels that the Uni-
versity must demonstrate trust in
individual students and in the gov-
erning bodies of each residence hall
and fraternity by delegating to them
the responsibility for determining
their own visitation hours and regu-
lations.”’

The Committee suggested that
each living unit determine its visi-
tation policy by a majority vote of
the residence voting in a secret
ballot, and that the governing body
of each living unit, should ‘‘de-
termine for the entire residence
unit regulations concerning visita-
tion which it deems appropriate for
the entire unit.”

A subcommittee should be set up,
according to the report, to mediate
any problems between the occu-
pants arising from visitation policy.

Four Air Views on Effects on Black Experience

React to Hiring of Black Professors

the ramifications of the black
studies situation on campus.
Necessary Change

When asked if the two black pro-
fessors would be more than new
faculty members, Sharon Gavin ’72
responded that, “The two blacks
are not just two more professors,
but are part of a necessary change
for the University. I think the Uni-
versity has seen that the black pre-
sence here is a reality, and it must
be understood.’”

Miss Gavin went on to say that,
“I hope the professors will be part
of a meaningful committment on
the part of the University toward
the realization of the black pre-
sence. She does not feel that they
are “‘tokens,’’ but that they are
“very real and black men.’ Miss
Gavin also stated that since each
professor’s blackness is a part of
him, his perspective on the’ courses
he teaches will inevitably be a
black one.

When asked about whether the
presence of two black professors
would attract more black students
to the University, she said, “It
would probably help - having these

two professors is a first step.”
Miss Gavin also discussed her
view of the faculty reactions. “I
hope white students and faculty are
adults and that they will act
normally,” she said. “There will
probably be no difference in re-

Treaty Referendum

ABS President Bob Nachshin an-
nounced today that the People’s
Peace Treaty was passed by the
faculty and administration by a
vote of 46-43. The vote of these 89
represents approximately one third
of those who were sent the ballot.
This brings the total vote of the
referendum to 578 in favor and 614
against. Thus, the University has
failed to ratify the People’s Peace
Treaty.

action from the black students.”
She also felt that there would be an
element of apathy among the Uni-
versity population toward black pro-
fessors.
Black Studies Program
“In the past, it has been said that

before any sort of black studies
program could be developed, more
qualified people were needed from
outside the University,’ stated
Steve Wyatt ’72. ‘“‘We now have
more qualified people. In theory,
then, we should see more work
done on the development of a black
studies program.”

In regard to attracting more black
students to the University, Wyatt
feels that, ‘‘Prospective black stu-
dents look for three things in a
college - scholarships, black studies,
and a black advisor. The University
is working on the last two counts.”

Wyatt stated that the presence of
black professors should help to tie
together the black experience on
campus. He also believes that it
should now be easier to get more
black students and faculty members
to the University.

Sub-committee’s Viewpoint

Kay Smith, a white member of
the sub-committee on Afro-Ameri-
can Studies, stated, “The two pro-
fessors will aid black studies in that
they are going to bring studies re-

A Study in Martsology

By ERIC RIESS

———————————
Kremlinology, the detailed study of every document and public ann-
ouncement that comes out of Moscow’s kremlin has become a favorite
political game for many western politicians. Few people realize that a
similar pastime is enjoyed by many people on the Bucknell campus.

I’m speaking of course of the martsologists: the professor, student
or administrator who spends a large percentage of his time observing
the goings-on in Marts Hall.

Specifically these martsologists are watching room 219, the office of
President Charles H. Watts, II.

Recently, the martsologists have discovered a number of important
‘facts’ which I think are of interest to the University Community.

The first fact which they have uncovered is that President Watts is
nearing the end of his term as lord over “300 acres set aside’ for Bucknell

They say first of all that the average term for a college president in
the United States is five to eight years and President Watts is currently
in the middle of his seventh year here so the University is ready for a
change if we are to keep up with the national average.

The martsologists say further that when the president came here from
The American Council on Education via Brown University he did it with
the goal of making a name for himself so that he could eventually go
back to the Ivy League. In other words, they say Bucknell is just another
rung in the educational ladder for Dr. Watts. (The vacancy at Princeton
is seen as incidental to the president’s plans, but is nevertheless con-
venient).

President Watts, according to sources, came here with specific goals
in mind, and now that he has either accomplished these goals or realized
that it is impossible to do what he wants he is ready to leave. Among
these goals are the new University Center, and an improvement of the
program of graduate studies. It appears that the president is batting only
500.

Other factors which appear to point towards a vacancy in Marts hall
in the near future are the President's relationship with the Board of
Trustees and the other members of the administration.

It appears that the President is a bit too liberal for certain members
of the board and also that the President’s attitude toward faculty mem-
bers who are currently in disfavor with the board is a bit tough for the
Trustees to take sitting down.

The President did gain ‘points’ with the Trustees with his handling
of last year’s strike week. While other campuses were in turmoil, the
trustees were able to look with pride at the constructive and peac
pursuits happening at Bucknell. Some Trustees have seen the ability of the
president as more than ample reasons to retain Dr. Watts at least until
the United States is out of Vietnam.

‘Also the Martsologists say that the President is having trouble rais-
ing money for the school. They claim that he has not impressed others
enough to get the big bequests and gifts which a private university needs.

COR Fund Drive

To the Editor:

The COR fund drive that took
place this past week on campus was
done with the humanitarian aspect
in mind. It is very important that
someone take the responsibility to
collect money to bring war-injured
Vietnamese children to the U.S.
for medical treatment not available
in Vietnam. This is what the Com-
mittee of Responsibility does in a
very apolitical manner. . .

The average Bucknell student who
contributed twenty-five to fifty cents
probably gave because he saw pic-
tures of maimed children in the
COR pamphlets. These made him
feel compassion enough to contri-
pute. . .Then perhaps he heard the
Viet veterans discussing war crimes
— a woman took her wounded son
to a military hospital and the
Americans would not admit them
because she did not have the pro-

to the Editor

ee EES
per papers. While she pleaded, her
son died in her arms. A story like
this generally upsets our average
student — even to the, point of
volunteering to help collect.

The money is great, for that is
what COR needs; however, it makes
little sense to keep donating money
as opposed to worrying about elimi-
nating the need for it. Why not at-
tempt to prevent the wounds and
pain from occuring instead of just
fixing them after they do?

The average student will make a
contribution and then walk away,
pleased with his generosity and
social concern, feeling that he has
done his part. This effort does noth-
ing toward stopping the war and
its subsequent injuries. If a person
cares enough to give to COR, may-
be he should care enough’ to take
action to stop the maiming. This
doesn’t mean everyone should do
something visible, but rather that
everyone should evaluate his posi-
tion on something as important as
the war and act upon it. Peace
rallies and civil disobedience may
not be the way for all, but there
may be some form of individual
protest or behavior that can express
a person’s beliefs.

Supporting withdrawal from Viet-
nam as quickly as possible seems
a logical step after contributing to
the COR drive. When the U.S. stops
dropping bombs and planting mines
there is obviously going to be fewer
children requiring our medical at-
tention. I do not believe that there
will be more killing and maiming
of civilians after we leave than
there is now; the “blood bath” fear
is not logical.

This week’s COR drive should
therefore lead to continuing action
on everyone’s part in the way of
disagreeing with present adminis-
trative plans and its slow with-
drawal. The war goes on — killing,
maiming, ruining lives and land —
The sooner we get out, the sooner
all of this will decrease and even-
tually end

Sincerely,

noise: bringing tt
all back dead

by peter eggers
(spiritual advisor and boggie king: allen wheatcroft)
subtitle: will the future be dead?
i’ve always liked the dead but i am surely not what you would call
an unconditional dead freak. in listening to their records there have
been times when i cannot really tell how good they actually are. so
for me, wednesday nite’s gala dead endurance test was also a (tah-
da-dah) musical test of the dead in my head. (sing along with that
one.)
part one: the new riders of the purple sage.
it seems like they had a good time playing their stuff (which is
nice) but almost two hours of very similar (and generally mediocre)
material is a bit too much.
now consider this next statement seriously (for a moment): what
would happen if almost any of the psychedelic/screaming/down-
home/jumping/far-out fans the new riders had wed. nite saw a
short-haired/straight country group that sounded exactly the same
as the riders playing in front of some local supermarket or at a
church bazaar? they would probably laugh at the “hicks” and hate
the band. i maintain that without the dead affiliation this group
would be nothing. (just as all of the beatles’ solo effort records
would probably not have gotten any airplay if they were not made
by beatles.) as there are unknowns who are making much better
music than that which appears on the beatle solo albums (j.geils
band for one), there are many country groups that have a more
convincing and interesting sound than the new riders. their mo-
notony succeeds only in cultivating boredom after the half-hour
novelty period is gone.
good points: the electric guitarist was quite competent; garcia
showed himself to be a mighty fine pedal steel player.
part two: the dead
the dead’s albums as a whole are a very inconsistent lot. the first
is a solid one in the blues vein featuring garcia’s fast lead work;
it is still a good album by today’s rock standards.
their best album is Anthem of the Sun which is one of the finest
rock albums of the 60’s along with the airplane’s Bathing at Baxter’s
and hendrix’s Are You Experienced. side one of Anthem of the Sun
is undoubetdly one of the most integrated electric symphonic-like
concert-sides that came out of 60’s rock.
the critical album for me was Live Dead. upon hearing Live Dead i
began to have doubts about how good the dead actually were.
(some asides before we go any further: 1) dead freaks rave over
Live Dead as being an example of a ‘‘good’’ dead concert; 2) the
way the dead played at bucknell was very similar to much of Live
Dead; 3) thus it is probably safe to assume that the dead were ‘‘on’”’
and having a “good’’ nite at bucknell. all these asides are trying to
get at it that the generalizations that follow pertain not to a “bad”
example of the dead but a “good” one, and thus they point out
various problems that the band does not overcome which impairs
its performance.)
all the playing is very improvisatory, subject to many chances of
error, and thus the dead play in a very difficult style. when they
play such long extended songs in a very free manner it is very
difficult to keep some kind of long-line movement in effect.
and this is where the dead falter. all the cuts on Live Dead and
all the longer songs they played here progress in wave-like alter-
nations of tight/exciting/soaring/rocking sections w ith generally
uneventful/just plain mediocre sections. one reviewer for rolling
stone commented (when reviewing Live Dead) that the dead sure
take a long time to iget into it, but it is sure worth it once they get
there. for me these periods of poking around looking for the right
ideas were almost uninteresting enough to diminish the impact of
the really fine rock passages which ultimately followed.
obvious highlights however: pigpen’s gusty rendition of ‘mama
you’re sure hard to handle’’/smokey robinson’s “i second that

“in no way immune from federal prosecution whether for resisting the
draft or conspiring to resist the draft.” Yet, it seems unlikely that more
than a minute percentage of the hundred thousand could be prosecuted.
Those who were would probably have grounds for appeal based on the

fact that they alone were selected for prosecution out of a large group |
of ‘criminals.’ Those who weren’t prosecuted could appear in court to |

confront the proceedings with the fact of their own similar, but unin-
dicted, cases. The tie-ups in the judicial process would be of mammoth
proportions. The government would once again be confronted with the
problem of enforcing a law which is rejected by a large segment of the
populace, but this time it would be on a gigantic scale.

Whatever the outcome, such year-round actions as the Charlottesville

Pledge should serve to remind those cynical souls among us that the
‘spring offensive’ is just one phase of a continuing battle being fought by
concerned Americans all over the country, regardless of the season.

Appropriations
To the Editor:

Thiis letter is in response to the
Bucknellian editorial of April 16
concerning the ABS Student Ap-
propriations Committee meetings
(why an editorial on this topic was
written as opposed to one encourag-
ing attendance at past weekend’s
Teach-In on the war, for example,
is, I suppose, only a matter of con-
jecture). Although the editorial
carried an inaccurate figure for re-
quests (the correct figure, $85,500,
was not known at the time) and
made an analogy that failed to be
analogous (only ten students are
allowed on the floor of the faculty
and are permitted to speak when
recognized), through no fault of its
own it did stumble upon a rather
major consideration regarding dem-
ocratic ideas, whatever they are.

The Student Appropriations Com-
mittee held budget hearings from
4 to 11 p.m. on Monday for all stu-
dent organizations requesting funds
for the 1971-72 academic year.
These meetings were open to any-
one in the University to attend and

Included among the possible donors of these big gifts are some members
of the Board, according to the Martsologists.

As a final bit of tangible proof that the president is leaving, the
martsologists quote the president as saying to an interviewee for the
position of Dean of the College of Engineering, “You'll see that Bucknell
is quite proud of it’s engineering program and although I won't be hera
when you take over, I’m sure that you'll realize this.”

The martsologists are currently working on finding out who wil
succeed Dr. Watts. There are several names that come to mind, notably
Dr. Wendel Smith the current Provost, and John F. Zeller, Vice President
for Administration and Finance

Dr. Smith seemingly is the logical choice, since he is supposedly
second in command. But many people feel that he has not had ‘enough
experience as an administrator, having been provost for only a year,

Zeller, on the other hand, has been around for many years and is
certainly experienced. Many point to him and say that when the President
is away, which is about 70% of the time last year, he is virtually running
the University anyway.

A third possible darkhorse cont sr, Dr. Mark Ebersole, who
was provost here until 1968. Dr is with The Ford Foundation
but last month, he announced he will take over as head of the graduate
school at Temple July 1. Reportedly, Ebersole took the job at Temple,
considered as a step down from the Ford Foundation, as a signal to &
one in the educational community that he wanted to get back into
administration.

All in all, the Martsologists agree that the Pres n
leave but they don’t exactly know when or who is going tc repl:
But then again, what Western politician knows when Breshney is going
to fall from power in Russia, let alone who will replace him ‘

Williams’ Play

By LINDA CAPUTO

Cap and Dagger will present its
fourth major production, The Glass
Menagerie by Tennessee Williams,
on Parent’s Weekend, under the
direction of Stuart White.

The Glass Menagerie is Williams’
first major play. The intense lyric
quality of the writing serves to
create a highly sentimental mood.
According to White, the Cap and
Dagger production is attempting to
recreate this unrealistic but tender
and touching mood

Special stage techniques are be-
ing employed to strengthen the
mood set by dialogue. For ex-
ample, the backdrop consists of a
series of large photographic panels.

In addition, White has chosen to
use the music from the original
production by Paul Bowles. This
music, which includes a violin and
celesta, is strikingly different and
contributes to the unrealistic tone
of the play, as well as maintain-

ing the proper mood of St. Louis
in the 1930's.

White also notes that because the
cast is small and the play is highly
autobiographical, the success of
the production relies heavily on the
cast to project the complex person-
alities of their characters.

The cast consists of Howard Ash-
man as Tom, Janet Cunningham as
Amanda, Nancy Henry as Laura,
and Trevor Lewis as Jim. The tech-
nical crew includes set design, Jim
Lyon; lighting, Rick Gardner; cos-
tuming, Ruth Brinen; and stage
manager, Maddy Posper assisted by
Shelia Fisher.

Performances will be held nevt
Thursday and Friday at 8:30, and
Saturday at 2:45 and 8:30. Tickets
for Thursday’s performance are
available at student discount rates
and weekend performances will
cost $1.75 and $2.00. Tickets are
available at the bookstore

while the students have achieved
the responsibility for establishing
visitation policies within their living
units, “the University cannot and
will not diminish its obligation to
assist in seeing that the rights and
welfare of all are protected.”

The report suggested that guide-
lines of implementation of policies
and statements of official University
policy, should be included in the
Student Handbook.

In an attempt to strengther re-
lations between the dorms and ABS,
Neil Hendershot, living unit repre-
sentative, drew up a motion. It
asked the dorm councils to consider
adding their elected living unit
representatives to their respective
dorm councils with full voting privi-
leges. The motion was passed.

The final discussion of an ABS
donation to the Committee of Re-
sponsibility found all in complete
agreement that $50 should be al-
lotted to help in providing medical
care and treatment for war-injuer-
ed Vietnamese children.

ABS Budget

The ABS Student Appropriations
Committee will compile the 1971-72

The ABS needs one Sophomore

sider students’ appeals of traffic
violations and to review and advise
on traffic regulations.

there are no new recruits for the

“This is why it is particularly im-
portant that the two men are as-
similated into the University com-
munity - it will make it much easier
to recruit more black professors.”

“Getting these two men on cam-
pus was an important first step, but
we must assimilate them so that
they will not be viewed as ‘tokens,””
Ficklin said.

Ficklin also expressed his hope
that white professors would in no
way feel that their jobs are threat-
ened by the presence of black pro-
fessors.

“The fact that these black pro-
fessors will also act as advisors
will aid the sense of black com-
munity here,” stated Ficklin.

Rinkus: ‘Bucknell Students Are Well Programmed’

(Continued from Page 1)
fer what they must we will force
the Vietnamese to be ‘free’ in spite
of themselves. This is all tied up
with the racist attitude. We are
liquidating a whole culture, a whole

people, in the process of ‘saving it.”

Rinkus related a joke, popular
among American officers in Saigon

| in 1966. The problem is the Vietna-
| mese situation. The solution? Sim-
| ple. Put all Vietnamese who are

‘for us’ on ships and send them out
to sea. Use nuclear weapons on the
entire country. then bomb the
ships.

“This reflected a great deal about
the racist nature of the situation to
me,” Rinkus said, recalling his re-
action at the time.

He remarked that all of his con-

| clusions about the war could have

been reached through critical ex-
amination of unclassified material.
In this respect, the existence of

| two books, Columbia Law Professor

Taylor’s Vietnam and Nuremburg,

| an American Tradgedy,”’ and Shell’s

“The Military Half,” refute the
contention that ‘‘only the president

| has enough information to decide

on the war issue.”

Rinkus encourages reading of

these books to “decide for your-
selves what war crimes are.”

He was asked what he thought of
the University’s apathy in the era
of campus concern and action on
political issues.

His reply: ‘Bucknell students are
well programed. In spite of the
fact that Bucknell has its quota of
Catholics and Jews, and is even
working toward its quota of blacks,
we are still possessed of a majority
of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants
— creating a drab uniformity in
thinking, dress, and actions, which
does a great deal to make the class-
rooms uninteresting.”

In regard to the recent student
rejection of the People’s Peace
Treaty, he says, ‘‘Another case of
Bucknell’s apathy. Only 1000 even
bothered to vote. . .unfortunately,
until the war affects their lives
personally, they can ignore it.”

Rinkus points for further exidence
of the University’s political im-
maturity to the fact that Mr. Ralph
Stein, a former military intelligence
officer who is with the Senate sub-
committee investigating military
surveillance of civilians visited the
campus last Saturday.

Attendance, which Mr. Stein said

numbered in the thousands on other
campuses, numbered 20-30 students
here. “The low attendence refledcts
the indifference of the Bucknell stu-
dent body,”’ the professor observed.

Even in the conservative South
Mr. Stein has drawn large crowds.
Apparently Wallacites are more
concerned with the growth of the
police-state than are students here.

Rinkus himself, on his return
from Vietnam, was stationed at
Fort Holabird, Maryland, where he
found massive information collec-
tion on civilians to be taking place.

“That’s the frightening thing,” he
said, “‘that we can have that type
of intrusion by the military into
civilian affairs.””

He urges any former military in-
telligence officers to contact him in
regards to supplying information
about civilian surveillance to the
Senate sub-committee.

Rinkus’ attitudes towards the fac-
ulty are no less caustic.

“I attended faculty meetings
faithfully for the first two years I
was here. I found that they didn’t
speak of anything of any real im-
portance until last May. Instead
they concern themselves with pro-
cedural trivialities. Their solution
to everything is a committee. Five

years later, there is a report sub-
mitted in committee prose, which
is hardly comprehensible to even
its authors. The whole nature of
our educational institutions is being
challenged and needs to be serious-
ly considered. We need change now,
not ten years from now.”

Rinkus attended the faculty meet-
ing concerning the Boyd Douglas
case, and together with Dr. Charles
Longley, assistant professor of po-
litical science, submitted a resolu-
tion opposing any surveillance on
campus. The more modified pro-
posal of Dr. Gene Chenoweth, pro-
fessor of political science, was ac-
cepted and a committee was form-
ed.

He said “It was apparent that we
were now going to experience the
intimidation at the University that
is prevalent in the society as a
whole. I went to the meeting to con-
front people and get them to ques-
tion. Nothing happened. A few days
ago, two more people were sub-
peonaed. It should be obvious that
the government is still fiishing here.
I’m familiar with the tactic of stag-

gering subpeonas iin order to mini- ,

mize adverse reaction.”
Rinkus no longer considers fac-
ulty meetings worth attending.

Rinkus Joins Veterans in Open Letter

Fellow Veterans Against the War:

As a former Captain in Army Intelligence who served in Viet-
nam from July, 1966 to July, 1967, I would like to join you in pro-
testing continued American involvement in the war in Indo-China.
I support the anti-war position of your organizers, John Kerry and
Al Hubbard, who appeared on the National Broadcasting Company’s
program ‘Meet the Press” on April 18, 1971. I also support your
anti-war operation, Dewey Canyon Til planned for April 19 to April
23, as a means of appealing to the conscience of all Americans to
end the death and destruction which we are responsible for by con-
tinuing to wage war in Indo-China. The destruction of all lives —
American, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian — must cease. We
must protest President Nixon’s policy of ‘“‘Vietnamization” as a
subterfuge for continuing the war through mechanization. Life will
continue to be destroyed as a result of American air power and
artillery.

As a means of supporting your efforts to protest the war, I have
inclosed the Joint Service Commendation Medal which I was
awarded while serving as an Intelligence Officer in the Combined
Intelligence Center, Vietnam. I would consider it an honor to have
you include this medal with other service medals which veterans
are planning to return to their Government on April 23.

In peace,
Jerome J. Rinkus

Weekend Film Presentations Include
Tora! Tora! Tora’ and ‘Cul-de-Sac’

By DAN MARTIN

Roman Polanski’s Cul-de-Sac
(4965) is the story of the painful
paradise gained by an odd couple
(Donald Pleasence and Francoise
Dorleac) who buy an isolated castle
on the British coast in an attempt
to recapture the wild, free life of
romantic yore. In addition to their
problems of everyday existence,
their edgy idyll is invaded by a
gangster (Lionel Standin) whose
partner is wounded, whos car is
broken down, and whose boss is
about to abandon him for incom-
petance.

Saturday Review’s Hollis Alpert
feels that ‘Polanski is presenting,
in Cul-de-Sac, his own comical and
at times nightmarish vision and
also seems to be saying that people
who retreat from the real world
are hardly likely to be able to re-
solve the problems they bring with
them as well as those that present
themselves.”

Richard Schickel, however, has a
somewhat less complementary view
of the film. He feels that “One
might have developed the encounter
of these three futiles with gentle
irony and come out with a satis-
fying sad commentary on mistaken
ambitions.” Polanski, however,
tried to turn the film into a black
comedy, with some overexplicit
sex, and a sadistic beating of Miss
Dorleac, a touch of transvestism,
and, finally, a bloodgushing climax
far too violent for what has come
before

Schickel asks: “What can Polan-
ski be thinking of? Why does he
oversell his joke, pushing it far
beyond humor to crude sensational-
ism? Doesn’t he know that the es-
sence of humor is knowing when to

these vows are too too private

stop?”’

Cul-de-Sac will be presented to-
night at 8 p.m. in Vaughan Lit.
Auditorium.

Winner of the 1959 Cannes award
for best director (Francois Truf-
fant), The 400 Blows centers on
twelve year old Antoine (Jean-Pier-
re Leaud), a young victim of unsuf-
ficient love on the part of his
mother and foster-father. Played
quite effectively by the amateur
schoolboy, Antoine becomes involv-
ed in the diversions, dodges, and
dares that make up a young boy’s
life-unusual only in the fact that
his pranks turn into crimes, includ-
ing an abortive attempt at robbery.

As usual, the critics differ in their
apprasial of this film, with News-
week seeing Antoine as a tragic
hero, with the deck stacked against
him. The boy portrays Antoine
“sensitively” and without cuteness,
and when he finally sheds a tear or
two as he’s carted away to reform
school, “the effect is unbearable.”

Hollis Alpert disagrees, however,
with this view of the dfamatic
effect, calling it “off-hand.” He
suspects that ‘““M. Truffant wasn’t
able to fully decide whether he was
telling a dramatic story or making
a serious psychological and social
study of a typical delinquent, and
by thus falling between two stools
he has visitated the emotional re-
sponse of his audience. The boy is
touching, but the sociology, grim
though it is, seems superficial.”

The English Department will pre-
sent The 400 Blows on Monday night
at 8:00 p.m. in Vaughan Literature
Auditorium.

weekend. The $25 million produc-
tion documents the events that led
up to, and the actual attack on
Pearl Harbor, offering amazingly
realistic recreations of actual events
—reactions which Richard Schick-
el claims cost more to produce on
film than the actual attack cost
Japan.

Schickel feels that for all of its
action, “TTT remains remote, un-
involving.” ‘‘Tolstoy wrote War and
Peace to prove, among other things,
that men can indeed lose control of
events and so become their prison-
ers. But nothing so existentially
grand-and chilling-is suggested here,
where _ pusillanimous objectivity
reigns.”

Hollis Alpert defends the film,
writing that ‘‘. . .while bombs crash,
barracks collapse, and bewildered
brass gaze at the debacle through
headquarters windows, a sense of
history broods over it all. Wars are
no longer politely declared That
time, man thousands; next time, if
it comes, many, many millions. One
hardly needs to say that Tora!Tora!
Tora! is both powerful and mean-
ingful and the very model of a
major motion picture.”

ever, this is confusing, as they are
with different people each day and
usually end up answering the same
questions. Says one: “It’s good for
meeting people, but hard on the
English.”’

The Belgians came with ques-
tions and impressions about Ameri-
ca ranging from the educational
system to the Vietnam war
In Europe, the American stereo-
type is represented by a lot of
money and a big car; but as the
Belgians traveled to this campus
through areas of both urban and
rural poverty, their views changed.

The differences between Ameri-
can and Belgian small towns don’t
seem as great to them now.

Their brief stay in New York
city left impressions of huge build-
ings, a Times Square for visitors

7, and amazement at a nickle

- ride in a very expensive city.
Walking down a deserted 5th Ave-
nue on a Sunday and observing
bicycles on one way streets gave
the city a certain unreality in the
minds of the Belgians.

For them, Vietnam is a distant
issue; one they are curious to speak
to Americans about, but one not
affecting their daily lives.

The generalized “I don’t care”
attitude of the Belgian people about
the issue drew criticism from one
student who felt the Belgian’s con-
cerns were too provincial as they
focus primarily on the internal con-
flict between the Wallons and Flem-
ings, two ethnic groups in Belgium
who differ in language, politics, and
culture, and create a general air of
tension within the country.

He suggested that ‘“‘more view of
life. The Americans seem to look at
many different problems from a
wider perspective.”

For many students, the Univers-
ity Center has faded into the
scenery as a structure somewhat
aloof and detached from campus
life, The utilization and appear-
ance of its interior remains a
mystery to most, as students spec-
ulate what changes will occur and
what traditions will fall with its
opening next September
Questions
Through an informal poll, stu-
dents raised the questions most
prominent in their minds about the
new Center. Most wanted to know
out the cafeteria system, what
student ivities would be incor-
porated within the building, and
generally how the Center would
serve them. The building is now 85
per cent completed and it is easy
to see the potential layout and
character of the rooms. Through a
iew of the basic structural
scheme, most questions can be
answered
The building consists of four

tween the second and third levels.
The controversial fourth floor will
not be completed at this time due to
lack of funds. It will cost $400,000
to $500,000 to finish the area, if the
contract is awarded to the Uni-
versity contractors

The space was originally designat-
ed for student activity offices, thus
causing several groups such as The
Bucknellian and the Pladement
Office to remain in their present
facilities. In order to alleviate the
lack of space problem, three meet-
ing rooms on another floor have
been changed to one large student
activities office, containing desks,
typewriters, and files for each
organization. In addition, the area
first allotted for a barber shop will
now house a computer terminal and
ABS office

The third level is primarily
lounges. The largest student lounge,
facing Moore Avenue, will be in-
formally decorated with a large
stone wall, wooden beams, and a
thick carpet. There will also be
several small lounges, one for
music tapes, others equipped with
study carrels. An amphitheater

rooms, and C.A. offices are also in-
cluded.

Dining

A new addition will be a served
dining area, much like a restaurant,
where an expanded menu will be
served at an added cost. Also, a
small regular cafeteria serving
persons attending meetings will be
located on this level.

The second level is completely
the dining area. Instead of the
normal cafeteria line, students will
serve themselves through a “‘super-
market system.’ Different food
items such as salads, beverages,
and meats will be on individual
counters and students will simply go
to the counters they want, rather
than waiting in one line. This pro-
cess serves more students effici-
ently and will also be utilized in
the student snack bar.

The cafeteria itself will be car-
peted and will have an outdoor
patio facing Moore Avenue. An in-
teresting feature of the cafeteria
is the conveyer belt that takes the
trays by spiraling down and travel-
ing underneath the floor to the
kitchen.

The first level houses a huge
bookstore, a post office serving the
entire campus, the student snack
bar, and game rooms. Replacing
the Bison and Guys, the snack bar
will have the permarket ser-
vice” system, vending machines,
and an outdoor patio located on the
front of the building.

Possible Delay

According to Mr. Walter Geiger,
director of the Physical Plant, the
Center should be ready for use
Sept.1, and will be open for pre-
liminary tours by Parents Week-
end, April 30, May 1 and 2. A pos-
sible delay in immediate comple-
tion could occur, however, when six
union trade contracts expire on
May 1, raising the possibility of a
freeze on construction. Negotia-
tions have been underway in at-
tempts to reach a settlement before
the deadline.

Planning Committee

One group that has been answer-
ing questions such as those raised
by the poll has been the University
Center Planning Committee. Com-
posed of students, faculty, and ad-
ministration, and headed by John
Zeller, vice president of adminis-
tration and finance, it has served
as a planning group and sounding
board during the development of
the Center. Their most recent task
has been to organize the dedication

emotion,” wellsuited for the dead for some reason/ china cat sun-
flower with garcia’s fine guitar/the extended improvisation on
thematic material from Anthem of the Sun and dark star/ a simple
moving version of kris kristofferson’s “me and bobbie megee,”
which also appears ‘on Pearl. individually, the dead were quite
good technically. garcia was most prominent with a quick linear
style that was very melodic and seemed to sing. phil lesh was ex-
cellent on bass with his nimble lead-guitarish style which brought
the bass out as both melody and bottom. kreutzman on drums was
deceptively good in that he kept the rhythm (train) driving along
while he continually added in subtle rhythmic nuances. Weir’s vocals
were very expressive and he sounded much better live than on
record. the unfortunate thing is that such individually good musicians
could not combine to play good music the whole time. when it was
good it was very good but why should we have to wait around a
good deal of the time for the “good parts.”
important socio-political note: no one can say the dead are out to
rip-off anyone/ they sure give one one’s money’s worth in quanity
anyway, (if that happense to be the way you judge a concert, which
would indeed be unfortunate.)
why
bringing it all back
dead?
in the so-called ‘freak’ world the dead mystique runs strong among
many. there is a great concern with what the dead will do next.
the dead evoke such things as san francisco, kesey and the bus,
good rock concerts, r. crumb comix, free music, owsley and his
acid, and a memory of a certain kind of life-style before the
k ardization of it by the media. an somewhat curious affection
exists for both the airplane and the dead. experiencing the dead
in person has much to do with religion, ritual, and cosmic events.
the dead experience seems to be almost an extra-musical one
communicated through the use of music.
(sidetrip: those who came to the concert without much kniwledge
of the dead’s extra-musical nature were at a distinct disadvantage.
they were not able to partake of the complete dead experience.
san francisco psychedelia finally made it to bucknell and the ma-
jority of bucknell still wasn’t ready for it. those who understood what
the dead were about and those who tripped at the concert got to the
essence of the dead; those who thought the dead were just another
rock band missed out on the totality of experience and peculiar
cultural heritage that the dead bring with them when they play.)
but this experience is beginning to become stale. this has something
to do with the fact that the musical style and sound of the dead
has remained virtually unchanged since Anthem of the Sun. “acid
rock” (to use a now almost meaningless term) seems to be a very
limiting genre. the dead, the airplane, hendrix, and other major
rock figures have not done anything essentially new with it in the
last three years. with their country albums everyone is saying that
the dead are bringing it all back home; they are setteling down. i
say they are bringing it all back dead, in the terminal sense.
country music is a dead end, the stress here being on the word
end: there is not much area to explore in this type of music. 0
my mind, the dead’s last two country-styled albums are an in-
dication of their realization that their idiom has become somewhat
unsatisfying. they have thrown themselves heartily into the country
music style which is much less complex and challenging for the
immediate gratification of a pleasant, fun-to-make music. (it might
also be pertinent to add that this change is selling them a lot of
records and making them much more money than before) (ah-hah!
economic determinism!)
so at present the dead are still a standstill; they are taking a
circular country detour. rock in general is stagnating. it wiill be
interesting to see what the dead will do next. country music and
old rock and roll, no matter how good, cannot carry them far into
the 1970’s. the dead charisma will not do it either. they must be-
come an adventuresome, creative force once again. they have to
“want to see and hear — everything.” if the grateful dead and rock
and roll in general decide to sit back, take it easy, and rest on
their laurels, they will both surely die. rock’s vitality comes from
movement, and rock itself must continually move on.

a stepping stone to run out the rest of the season successfully.

Tennis — What more can be said about Reynold’s racketmen? To
continue their super season going, they'll have to tangle with the
Scarlet Knights from Rutgers in a home bout at 1:30 p.m.

Track — The cindermen specialty teams and some of the stronger
field event men will travel to Philadelphia to participate in the Penn
Relays. This marks the first appearance in the relays in a long time
for the trackmen who will be competing against many of the major

colleges in the East.

By DAVE COULTER

As the spring sports season ap-
proaches its midpoint, the records
once again show the tennis team
leading the way. Carrying a string
of 28 victories, six in this season’s
campaign. Bu_ is pressing hard
in quest of an MAC title. However
the squad is quite young with only
one senior, Alex Anderson, who
handles the second singles position.

Alex is quite “optimistic” about
the prospects for this season,’ as
long as the four, five and six men
do well. Up top we’re as strong as
we were last year, when any of
the top five could beat any other
on a given day, and we have three
of the five back this year.

“So far the top three have been
winning while the bottom three
have been having trouble. However,
no team will overpower us, even
though some may have more
depth.”

But if the Bisons continue to
play well, Alex feels they should be
able to advance into the MAC finals.
However, he notes that in the fall,
St. Joseph’s had the top MAC
singles player in Steve Barnet.
They also may have “a little more
depth than we have, for while we
beat them last year 6-3 they didn’t
sraduate anyone.

‘As our team plays more matches
we should get stronger and be much
better by the end of the season
Also, we have played in a lot of
wind so far which is probably a
new experience for some of the
younger players.”

This years team also features
Steve Baird, who is.a junior, at
first singles and Jim Lackritz, also
, junior, who plays ‘‘very rong”
at the third singles spot
lieves that continued play wi
prove talented sophomares Keith
Kimball and Bob Christianson, and
freshman Bruce Kevan.

“Next year,’ Alex feels, ‘‘The
team should be just as strong if
not stronger. I’m the only senior
and an entire nucleus will return
next year. Also a freshman will
join the team who was the top
player in the 18 and under class in
New England. We could have a
tennis dynasty if we can keep gett-
ing more freshmen Next year we
will also have an indoor tennis
court which can be rolled on the
gym floor If we can keep doing
well, people will think of BU asa
tennis school and it will be easier
to recruit and keep a winning
team.”

season.”

As far as getting psyched for a
match, Alex tries to ‘“‘go out with
the attitude that you must play your
own game before your opponent
gets his started. For example, you
have to make him miss his back-
hand by playing up to the net, and
exploiting his weakness. You must
force the other guy to make mis-
takes; often you do not win, but
the other player is forced to lose.”

“There is a great difference,
though, between doubles and
singles; it is much harder to hit a
shot that no one can get to, a com-
plete winner in doubles. You must
get the opponent to hit a shot that
is high enough or soft enough for
you to handle easily. You don’t
want to hit a shot that the other
guy can take advantage of. It is
much easier for the other team to
capitalize on your mistakes in
doubles.”

Alex asserts that “the most im-
portant thing in playing is to con-
centrate and keep your cool. I try
to get to the net and force him,
while not making any mistakes.

Notes &
Comment

By ALAN GROCHAL

Athletic intramurals involve more students than any other activity
at the University. According to Wrestling Coach Richard Schumacher,
coordinator of the intramural program, 1740 different bodies participated
in the various sports offered

‘The objective of intramurals is to involve as many students as
possible. Right now about 50% of BU’s male population are competing.”
Coch Schumacher noted.

While Schumacher considers the intramural program ‘‘well organized”
he is planning some changes.

“Intramurals are headed in the direction of a more open program.
I'd like to open up all sports like the basketball league this year.”

Basketball intramurals gave any upperclassman the opportunity to
form their own teams iinstead of playing for a fraternity or independent
team

In the future, Schumacher would like to be able to send all-star in-
tramural teams to other schools to compete against their intramural
champions.

Schumacher also forsees, with increased student participation, the
necessity of scheduling intramurals seven days a week

“We really have poor basketball facilities and the playing fields are
just adequate. Greater student involvement would necessitate Sunday
afternoon or night intramural games.”’

In respect to other schools’ programs, our University compares

vor At BU eleven different sports are offered. Penn State’s intra-
mural program for example, features 14 different sports, but a majority
of these are single eliimination tournaments which might give a team
only one opportunity to play. At a smaller school, such as Susquehanna,
only five sports are offered on the intramural level.

The only superiority of Penn State’s intramural program lies in the
awards system. Due to the fact that each entering team is charged a
small entrance fee, the school is able to have elaborate trophy presenta-
tions

This subject of money comes right to the heart of the problems in
the University’s intramural program. During the fall sports program it was
referees to insure getting good ones. This cost, com-
bined with money for equipment, use of facilities, and presentation of
trophies runs into a large sum. Because of the large number of students
who efit from athletic intramurals, we feel that this expenditure can

dorsed a strengthing of the intramural program in their pre-election
speeches.

Now is the time that they can do something to strengthen intramurals.
Coach Schumacher has set a budget this year and it behooves ABS to ap-

Spring Football Game Stages
Bison Freshman-Varsity Battle

The annual Blue-White football
game will be held here in Memorial
Stadium at 7:30 Friday night as
usual, but this year Coach Fred
Prender has added a new twist to
the intrasquad battle. The Bison
head mentor has divided the squad
into two teams consisting of the
freshmen on one unit and the var-
sity on the other.

Prender said, “There are a couple
of exceptions to the rule, but pri-
marily that’s the way the two
squads will be divided. I think that
it will make for some fierce compe-
tition.”’ Co-captain Joe DiOrio will
play on the defense for the freshmen
and sophomore Rich Zentz, who was
out all last year with an inyujr,
will run in the frosh backfield.

Doing the quarterbacking for the
Blue team (varsity) will be regular
signal caller Howard Burke, who is
returning from a shoulder separa-
tion, and frosh Paul Kmetz. The
White team will have freshman
Carl Probst and Will Pike at the
reins.

Running in the Blue backfield will
be sophomores Rick Diez, Mitch
Farbstein and Gregory Wright. The
two wide receivers will be junior

The Bison golfers picked up vic-
tories yesterday in a home tri-meet.

senior Al Shiffler and sophomore

The White team offensive backs
will be freshmen Pat Caffrey and

The wide receivers will be fresh-
men Bob Chandler and Bill Stein.

Prender said, “‘The Spring Game
brings to an end 20 days of hard
work. It gives us a chance to show
what we’ve been working on. The
kids always look forward to it. I
hope that many of the fans will be
out to see us on Friday night.”

Impressive Strength Up Middle
Keynotes Baby Bison’s Attack

By KEN DOAK

The Bison ‘“B’’ baseball squad,
consisting of 29 freshmen, has been
working in virtual anonymity while
developing some ballplayers for fu-
ture BU varisty teams.

Coach Bill Lane has been im-
pressed with their attitude. Despite
being handicapped by playing only
four games, he sees some of them
helping the Bisons next season. He
said, “If they can play summer ball
and improve their skills, they
should be fairly adequate players
by next year.”

They began their season in style
by routing Luzerne Community Col-
lege 16-4 on Monday, and playing
what the Coach called “a real fine
game.” He was especially pleased
with their alert defensive play.

The strength of the team lies at
catcher, second base, and center
field. Lane said, ‘‘We’re good
through the middle, and that’s the
keystone of any ballclub.”

These three players are Ed Coh-
en, Connie Dwire, and Stan Page
They sparked the offense against
Luzerne, as well as doing well de-

Fading Diamondmen
Defeated by Pitt, 6-2

By KEN DOAK

The Bisons dropped another ball
game Tuesday as they lost to Pitt
6-2, dropping their overall record
to 2-8.

The Herd had plenty of baserun-
ners for a change, but could not de-
liver the big hit as several hard
hit balls were caught with men on
base. As a result, 15 runners were
stranded.

Before yesterday’s contest with
F&M, Coach Tommy Thompson was
still looking for a way of getting
some runs across the plate. He said
of his players: ‘“They’re getting
down on themselves; they’re press-
ing. We’ve just got to keep swing-
ing.”

At Pittsburgh, Gene Luccarelli
opened the game with a big home-
run as he continued his strong hit-
ting. However, BU found themselves
down 5-1 before they could get on
the scoreboard a second time.

The Panthers reached starter
Tony Zidansek, who was working
on short rest, for a run in the first,

Cohen collected three hits and two

ed, “Cohen looks like a real fine
hitter. He always gets a piece of
the ball.”

Page was the offensive star
against Luzerne, as he banged out
three hits, scored four times, and
drove in five runs. He also covers
a lot of ground in the outfield. De-
wire also drove out two hits.

Other starters include Jim Rich-
ardson (1B), John McIntyre (SS),
Bill Walsh (3B), Jeff Fischer (LF),
and Ray Linstrum (RF). Other
prospects include shortstop Tom

Against Luzerne, starting pitcher
Jim Bolognese went the distance,
yeilding nine hits and three earned
runs, while fanning nine. Lane said,
“He was ahead of every batter. He
pitched a real fine game.”

Bolognese and Steve Speechley,
in addition to hurling for the B
squad, have been relieving for the
varsity and doing a_ respectable
job.

Smolen Predicts No Shortage
In Housing for Coming Year

By JUNE CAFFREY
and LINDA DIETRICK

Mr. Len Smolen, Associate Di-
rector of Residence Halls, has an-
nounced that there is ‘no serious
housing shortage on campus.”

After last week’s room drawing
it was rumored that six present
freshman women were left without
rooms. Smolen said that there is
“sufficient room for all women
now” because the University has
opened the entire first floor of
Harris Hall to upperclass women
Smolen added that most rooms
were adequate except for the slight-
ly crowded conditions in B-Wing of
Swartz Hall.

One future resident of B-Wing re-
marked upon seeing her room (now
wi Single which will be made into a
double), ‘“‘The main problem be-
sides crowding will be the amount
of storage space available. The
closets and drawers seem only ade-
quate for one person.”

With regards to the rumor that
there were 140 freshman men with
no room assignments Smolen said
that there are 61 unassigned spaces
which will presently be opened. This
leaves 79 unhoused men. This num-
ber is very low in comparison to
last year’s figure.

Smolen sees a good possibility

D.C. Demonstration Draws Thousands;
Movement Emerges from ‘Hibernation’

By DAVID LOGAN
News Analysis

Poets and _ pseudo - philosophers
have told us that in spring, “a
young man’s fancy turns to love.”
This has been expanded in recent
years to include, “and demonstrat-
ing.”

Last Saturday the Peace Move-
ment came out of its winter hiber-
nation and took to the streets of
Washington, D.C. in, as one of the
speakers put it, “the biggest anti-
war demonstration of the year.”

It seems to me that it had to be,
since it was also the first of the
year. But that is nit-picking. The
demonstration was large and peace-
ful and important to a yet-to-be-de-
termined degree.

Actually, it wasn’t the fiirst. For
the week preceding the march, a

Deuxed Coup

large contingent of Vietnam veter-
ans camped out on the Mall and
lobbied in Congress. Apparently the
impact they had was large, and
their concerns were felt (if not
shared) by the whole nation. Their
activities were capped by the
medal-dumping on the Capitol steps
on Friday

Throughout the week the vets
voiced their concern about Vietnam
in only ways that a vet could. This
is probably the only large difference
between this and the other big
demonstrations in D.C., but there
are other less important but equal-
ly interesting ways to distinguish
it

‘Funkier’ 1971 Beach Boys
Disperse ‘Good Vibrations’

By DEAN LANDEW

(1971 version) All of this talk
about the New Beach Boys, I’m not
sure about it, see. . .just because
it’s so many years after “Little
Deuce Coupe’’ and ‘Surfin U.S.A.”
and things have gotten louder and
more technical and Jimi Hendrix
has been here and gone, it doesn’t
mean that there is going to be New
Beach Boys.

I know what the idea is, it’s that
these people who did so much with
their music a few years ago can
still be trend setters (or at least
they can still be In There), so
they’re coming up with some new
songs that show that they are in-
terested in keeping up.

I tell you, though, I heard these
Beach Boys Friday, and they
haven't improved a lick on their
instruments. Carl and Al have got

BILL WHITNEY
(Editor’s Note: This is the last of
a two-part news analysis concern-
ing the hiring of two black pro-
fessors. David T. Shannon will join
the faculty as associate professor of
religion and advisor to students.
Richard E. Smith will join as as-

sistant professor of English.)

Dr. Harvey Powers, professor of
English and chairman of the sub-
committee on Afro-American
studies, discussed the appointment
of the two black professors. ‘The
hiring of these two black profes-
sors is a 200% improvement over
the present situation. Shannon is
deeply committed to the notion of
finding a model of black studies ap-
propriate to the University,” as-
serted Powers. “He will provide
guidance and leadership that we
asked for when we recommended
that a consultant be hired.’’

“Smith is a scholar who is com-
ing to fill a vacancy in the English
department, but it is our good for-
tune that he happens to be black.

heavier sounding than Fenders, and
the whole sound is big, sort of, with
the horns and piano and percussion,
but it’s still trebly and light and
hygienic and really about as safe
as milk.

So their hair got longer and they
swapped their Good Humor suits
for other clothes (particularly Mike
Love looks pretty good, doesn’t he?)
and they do dope and meditation
and they probably have got groupies
too, but didn’t you hear the same
old band, of last decade? I mean
there were an awful lot of polo
shirts and short pants Friday that
usually don’t show up at concerts
these days.

Some of their old stuff is done
over so it’s slower and sort of
funkier, like “Help Me Rhonda,”
but wasn’t it great to hear “I Get
Around” again like it really used
to be? And ‘‘California Girls?’’ God,

what a little bit of wine and with
all your friends there, you knew the
musie wasn’t as good as the Band
or someone like that, but who
cares?

You were there to have a good
time, see what the Beach Boys look
like now, and hear some good old
tunes. They don’t have to change.
They shouldn’t. It just sounds good
to hear the Beach Boys again and
enjoy the old songs.

And even though “Darlin” and
“Good Vibrations’ and the Pet
Sounds stuff in general is still
really good music, and it’s so nice
to hear some real melody these
days, the encore was the best part
of the concert, really, wasn’t it?
They knew what the crowd wanted.

Even though they ended on a new
unknown song (from Sunflewer, the
new album they’ve played on the

Hiring of Two Blacks Attracts Praise,

He will be teaching two freshman
English sections in black literature,
and, in this respect, he will be a
positive contribution. It is rather
valuable to have both men here.”

When asked if he felt the two men
might become ‘“‘tokens,” he replied,
“People who are thinking in terms
of tokens are also thinking in terms
of prejudice. However, we have no
effective means of combating pre-
judice.”

Powers also feels that in the past,
black students have not turned
down admission to the University
because there have been no black
professors. ‘‘Rather,” he stated,
“blacks have been offered admis-
sion elsewhere where they have bet-
ter scholarship aid. I do feel that
the University will appear more at-
tractive now to black students,
especially since one of the men has
been specifically appointed as an
advisor to students.

“If we do want to really attract
more black students, and other
minority students, then we must de-
velop a healthier financial aid pro-

gram than we have presently.”

When asked if he felt the Uni-
versity might be more able to at-
tract more minority group profes-
sors, Powers said, ‘I do think that
the more progressive faculty mem-
bers find the faculty somewhat nar-
row. It is unnatural for a faculty
as large as this one to be pre-
dominately white. I do feel that the
University will be able to attract
more good professors, both white
and black.”

Powers went on to say, “I am
delighted with the turn of events,
which are in part due to the efforts
of our committee.

Powers also commented on whe-
ther he felt there would be any type
of friction between the two men and
the rest of the faculty. “I can’t
imagine that there will be any sort
of friction. I am sure my collea-
gues are just and honorable men
who will welcome these two new
faculty members.

Let’s Keep It Peaceful

The spring movement now marches
into a critical period — so say the organ-
izers. Late April and early May are
scheduled as a time for militant non-
violence which demands a stronger com-
mitment than that needed to march last
Saturday.

This week, the People’s Lobby will
confront various government agencies,
asking them to ratify the People’s Peace
Treaty. Saturday, May 1, will bring a
rally of festive nature to Rock Creek
Park. This day will build strength and
solidarity for the May 3 - 5 actions plan-
ned to “shut down the city.” During
these days, groups will mass at the major
transportation junctions in and near
Washington and attempt to snarl traf-
fic for the entire day. The commitment

tem, including any militancy. It is as-
sumed that men, working militantly,
necessarily act emotionally and irration-
ally. In living in a world where men
control their own lives and have no de-
signs on that of others, mass action has
no place. Inherent in this lifestyle, how-
ever, is a total rejection of the exploita-
tion & violence of the present system.

The commitment to nonviolence
which will bring many to Washington
has the added dimension of militancy.
Out of these actions, Dave Dellinger
hopes “we may on the one hand add to
the widespread sense of crisis and urgen-
cy, and, on the other hand, avoid alienat-
ing people by seeming to be irrespons-
ible or self-indulgent.” The belief is that
to live in a nonviolent world, the exist-
ing violence must be halted - nonviolen
ly. But only militancy can assure this
end.

What’s Happening in D.C.

People’s Coalition for Peace & Justice

People’s Lobby — April 26 - May 4

Perhaps the most effective action taken last spring after
Cambodia and the killing of students at Jackson and Kent was
the invasion of Washington by people demanding to talk to their
government.

They were people’s lobbyists. And on a one to one basis, they
talked to the people who run the war machine, Congressmen, the
White House staff.

This year there will be a broader people’s lobb;
when we're asked “What do you want, anyway?”
“Sign the People’s Peace Treaty.”

The object of the People’s Lobby is to talk to everyone in the
government in Washington. To show everyone the treaty and ask
him to sign it. To ask him to join in the “no more business as
usual’? moratorium May 5. To demand that the war end now, that
a date be set to complete the withdrawal of all troops from South-
east Asia

To demand a guaranteed annual income of $6500 for a family
of four

And to demand the freedom of all political prisoners.

Starting Monday, April 26 the lobby will call on Congress,
Selective Service, IRS, Justice Department, and the Pentagon.

FOCUS: Counselors

By JOHN FRIEDMAN

After participating in a discussion of
April 22 in Roberts, with the new and old ‘‘j.c

held on
» | have arrived at the

‘junior counseling,”

final realization — there is no hope in this tradition. I attended hoping
to curtail the shit I knew would be flying, and ended getting it all over

me

What kind of perspective can these people, these “‘counselors,”’ have

when they preface every sentence with enther.
or “How should I talk to them when they

What should I do if. . .?”
2”? These “counselors” kept

speaking of their responsibilities as “‘j.c.’s”’ rather than the importance,

the necessity, of individual freedom

and independence. To limit the

absurdities one would have to interrupt every sentence spoken, and start
another using the aforementioned ground.

What kind of orientation, or more importantly; what kinds of re-
lationships can freshmen have when these people, their immediate “buck-
nell” contacts, are involved in their role as j.c. (and its contingencies)
to such an extent, that they feel forced to play “counselor,” instead of
being themselves. Can I possibly express my anger and dismay over a

system grounded in shit!

Get to know the Administrators!

To the Editor:

In answer to the anonymous letter
about je and ra selection.

Upon first reading your letter
about counselor selection I was fur-
ious. Re-reading it I felt only pity
and sadness for you, as a member
of the Bucknell community as well
as a human being. . «

How do you know what the ad-
ministration wants to hear?. . .First
if you honestly know what they
want to hear, it can only be through
personal contact with these ad-
ministrators which invalidates your
reference to the point of twenty
minute interviews. To really know
what they are looking for in a coun-
selor, you must really know the ad-
ministration, which refutes your
thesis that a twenty minute inter-
view is the only criterion in all
cases. If, however, you assume
these qualities to be the obvious

criterion, don’t you believe that
some people really do possess
them? I know that some of the
counselors selected exhibit great
quantities of your in-quote phrases.

Secondly, if you only talked with
them for twenty minutes and are
accusing them of making snap de-
cisions, I strongly feel that you have
made the grossest assumptions.

Not only is it immature and in-
conceivable to me that you could
believe what you wrote, but truly
the saddest phenomena present in
the world today-that of mistrust
and false assumptions by one hu-
man being of another. Only if you
really know a person, can you with
any conscience make these state-
ments — and then only about in-
dividuals, not the entire administra-
tion.

radio recently, did you hear it got
good review in Rolling
, we saw the Beach Boys,
and it was really more the whole
excitement of seeing them than the
music itself, right? And for a
. who could miss? Cool. . .you
w? Everybody had a good time.
(1965 version) Everybody was
ready for the concert. Ronny and
Cindy and Tommie and Debbie were
there, and then we picked up Billy.
Especially Billy looked good in his
white levis because he had been in
the sun and got a tan. It was nice
and sunny and Mom took us over
to Newark in the Chevy with the
top down so our hair could blow
and we really wanted to get there.
We had great seats! We were in
the fourth row and we could see the
Beach Boys perfectly, we were so
close. They did “I Get Around,”
“Little Deuce Coupe,’ ‘‘Surfer
Girl,” “California Girls’ and even
“Good Vibrations” which we could-
n’t believe they could do except on
the record. There was screaming
for Dennis, he was the one they
wanted most. Billy thought Dennis
was the coolest one, the way he

looked cool and got all the girls.
The only part I didn’t like was
when these four girls charged down
the aisle yelling and jumped in on
me and Ronny trying to get on
the stage. It was all wild, and we

all thought it was great.

We turned on the radio in the.

convertible on the way back home,
but the news was on so we shut it
off. Instead we let the wind blow
our hair and we sang “Barbara
Ann” all the way home. We even
stopped for Dairy Queens. It was
the life, just being with your friends
and singing and having a good time.

Billy got the Beach Boys party
album when we got home and we
all went over to his house to get a
Pepsi and hear it. It was a good
record and we all had a great time.

Housing Shortage

(Continued from Page 1)
iin fraternity houses, or to leave
the University.

Smolen noted that the slight im-
balance on the waiting list in the
proportion of men and women was
due to a larger number of women
living off campus in apartments
that men normally would have oc-
cupied. As a result the University
will house approximately 640 up-
perclass men and 660 upperclass
women.

The reason the University did not
open all housing for room drawing
was that there was a question of
which sex needed more rooms. As
to why the University maintains a
waiting list Mr. Smolen replied that
“it is part of the normal function
of residence halls to insure that
they won’t be left with 30 vacant
rooms in September.”

As for freshmen, the office has

taken into account an expected
class size of 725, all of whom must
be guaranteed a room by the uni-
versity. This is a reduction of about
75 freshmen over last year, and
will provide additional room open-
ings for upperclassmen.

According to the Admissions Of-
fice, 373 deposits have been received
from prospective freshmen, 220 of
which were early decision candi-
dates. Slightly more than that num-
ber are expected to accept offers
of admission by May 1, the dead-
line for deposits, bringing freshman
acceptance to about 750. Some 20-30
of those would then be expected to
cancel over the summer.

The reduced freshman class, add-
ed to the expansion of existing
housing by converting lounges,
singles into doubles, etc., has re-
sulted iin 155 more openings for
upperclassmen over last year.

Hiring of Blacks

(Continued from Page 1)
Professor Smith as a “welcome
change,” but Garvin emphasized
that the two think of each other
in professional terms.

Dr. Garvin expects the faculty
reaction to be ‘‘very good - it
certainly was in the English de-
partment. Most of us like the fer-
ment of having a blach professor
in the department.”

He also does not believe that
the new professor is any type of
token. ‘Neither the English depart-
ment nor Professor Smith would
have considered the appointment if
there had been a question about it.”

“There should be no great em-
phasis on his blackness,” comment-
ed Garvin. Such emphasis would
not be very sophisticayed nor ac-
curate.”’

Shannon

Dr. Douglas Sturm, chairman of
the religion department, comment-
ed on the appointment of David
Shannon as associate professor of
religion. ‘Professor Shannon will
be a regular member of the faculty,
but he will also be a co-ordinator
in the investigation of the future

|

for a black studies program here.

At this point, however, there is
still a question about a formal
blach studies program. However,
we do have a ‘definite man’, and
that man has the assignment to
make plans.”

“T feel Shannon will fit right in
with the faculty,” Sturm went on
to say. “Both professors are also
expressions of a meaningful com-
mitment to have black professors
on campus.

When asked about whether more
black students might be attracted
to the campus now, Sturm replied
“In principle, yes, but in fact, the
future is uncerta Two blacks do
not make a broad community.
However, I do have genuine hopes
for the formation of a black com-
munity at the University in the
future.”

Pep Talk Provides Inspiration
As Laxmen Trounce Leopards

By ALAN GROCHAL

By outscoring Lafayette 10-1 in
the second half, the Bison laxmen
erased a halftime deficit and
trounced the Leopards 11-3 Satur-
day

Instrumental in the Herd’s turn-
about according to several of the
players, was an inspired half-time
pep talk by Coach Sid Jamieson.

“If we come out on the short end
of this game it’s going to be a long
bus ride home and a heckuva a
week of practice.’’ Coach Jamieson
remarked to the team

BU seemed to come alive in the
second half as they scored five
goals in each of the last two quart-
ers and outshot Lafayette 35-10 in
that span

Freshman Kevin McCabe scored
five of the team’s first six goals and
his five goal total for the game was
one short of the club record.

Coach Jamieson felt that indivi-

dual performances were not the
whole story of the game, however.

“All through the year our over-
all team play has been strong. An
indication of this is the number of
assisted goals in every game.’ he
noted

Eight of the eleven Bison goals in
Saturday’s game were assisted. On
the season about seven out of every
eight goals have been assisted.

The job done by the younger
players also warranted Jamieson’s
praise. He cited in particular, soph-
omore Gary Germond, freshman
Kevin McCabe, and sophomore Jim
Tonges, for their fine play.

The laxmen now have two home
contests coming up, Wednesday
against Dickinson and Saturday
versus Washington College. The
Dickinson game shouldn't be too
tough, but Washington College is
perennially one of the better la
crosse schools in the country. This
will be a difficult league game

Frosh Gridders Edge Varsity, 7-6

By ERIC RIESS

In spite of the fact that Dave
Boyer practiced football for less
time this Spring than any member
of either the blue or white squads,
he turned out to be the busiest man
on the field, and both the hero and
the goat in the annual encounter
Friday night.

The White squad, made up pri-
marily of freshmen, won the event,
edging the veterans 7-6 before a
sparse crowd at Memorial Stadium.

Boyer was the punter and place
kicker for both teams and the fact
that he punted a combined total of
18 times and attempted two PAT’s
perhaps tells the story of the con-
test better than any other statistic.

Boyer has spent most of the
Spring with the track team, prac-
ticing in the field events, concen-
trating on the javelin. Friday night
he averaged 39.4 yards per kick in
his 18 attempts, after only practic-
ing Thursday with the rest of the
football team.

Of his attempts, ten were for the
winning white team quarterbacked
by freshman Carl Probst, and Will
Pike. The two freshmen were un-
able to generate much of an of-
fense gaining a total of only 80

PAGE FOUR APRIL 27, 1971

The three field men found the go-
ing just as rough. Bob Smith leaped
445’ 8’’ in the triple jump and plac-
ed seventh. Doug Nauman threw
the javelin 205’ 33. and placed
eighth.

This weekend the linksmen split
at Rutgers as they defeated Col-
gate, 400-407, while losing to the
home team to 400. Sophomore
Greg Mordas was the low Bucknell
man at Rutgers with a 78.

The Bisons entertain Rider and
Lafayette on Friday afternoon.

They got their final run in the top
of the seventh when a successful
bunt, a walk, and a single made the
score 3-0.

BU then made things exciting
with a last-gasp rally. Gene Luc-
carelli singled and Marty Stenzel
belted out a long double to bring
home the run

John Rudolph then lofted a wind-
blown fly to left-center that dropped
as the Delaware outfielders col-
lided, and the Bisons ended up with
runners on second and third

However, Chris Riley hit a fly ball
to left and Dave Hill grounded out
to third to end it

In the second game, the victors
bunched two singles, a walk, and a
long double by Mark Cacciatore to
take a 2-0 lead in the second.

BU finally scored in the sixth
when Dave Greenwood walked, ad-
vanced on an error, and rode home
on Bill Lane’s RBI single

The Hens made the final score
3-1 as they added an unearned run
in the final frame. The Bisons load-

ed the bases in their half, but could |

not get a key hit.

yards in total offense.

Pike completed the only aerial
for the White. That pass was a bit
on the unusual side as Pike called
a center eligible play. With all but
four members of the team lined
up on the far left of center, Bruce
Sobus snapped the ball and found
himself standing all alone on his
pass pattern.

The White score came on a 71-yd.
drive led by Probst. Helped by
three penalties, one of which was a
pass interference call on the Blue
7 yard line, Probst directed the of-
fense to the one before taking the
ball over himself on a fourth down
play.

Boyer kicked what proved to be
the deciding point, drilling the ball
through the uprights soccer style
like he had done for the freshmen
last year.

For Boyer it was his second place
kick of the game, the first being a
50 yard field goal attempt in the
first period. On that play the holder
had trouble placing the ball down
and Boyer was forced to run with
the blocked attempt, a fact which
could influence Boyer’s performance
in track this season.

According to Boyer, ‘“‘When I
was tackled on the play I went
down head first and then someone
fell on my leg and bent it into
a backwards ‘L.’ I heard something
erack and it’s been sore ever
since.”

After the most exciting play of
the game, a 51 yard sprint by Greg

Wright off left tackle, Burke moved |

the ball the remaining 15 yards into
the White endzone with two passes
in the next 5 plays. The score came

on a two yard pass to Ed Mc-

The Blue team had a total of 207
yards in total offense. Burke and
Kmetz were more successful
through the air, connecting on 13 of
26 passes, with Kmetz connecting
on 7 of 12 attempts.

Commenting on his performance
Boyer added, “I'll probably do a
lot of work over the summer. I
don’t have my timing down and I
have to practice getting my punts
away quicker.

That’s probably the attitude of
most of the team: judging from the
performances Friday night, when
August rolls around they’ll have a
lot to do to get ready for the Citadel
who will invade Memorial Stadium,
September 18.

D.C. Police Release Love,
Four Students after Sit-in

By DEAN LANDEW

Four University students and one
former University student have been
released on bail of $25 by the Wash-
ington, D.C. police department. Two
freshmen, Hoabie Swan and Gary
Norton, had been released Wed-
nesday, while Eric Leroy, Pete
Doscher, and Tom Love were all
released yesterday after bail money
had been raised on campus

Gardiner

Senior William Gardiner was re-
cently cited for contempt of court
during proceedings of the Grand
Jury investigation into the alleged
kidnapping plot, and conspiracy to
bomb the Capitol, now taking place
in Harrisburg.

Gardiner, who received a John
Doe subpoena, refused to testify,
was then granted transactional im-
munity by the prosecution, but still
refused to testify. This action
brought about the contempt citation,
and he must now return to Harris-
burg on May 10, for a hearing.

They had been arrested and jailed
Wednesday morning on a disorderly
conduct charge along with 200 others
who were all protesting the Vietnam
War by sitting in front of Selective
Service headquarters.

The sit-in had begun Tuesday
night and the arrests were made
the next morning after the demon-
strators had formed what Swan
called ‘a human carpet.” They
were all taken to the Third Precint

jail in the city

Swan and Norton came up with
bail money of $25 each after being
arraigned and were released. Swan
pleaded not guilty and faces a trial
appearance in the next few week.
He returned to the University
yesterday.

Doscher, LeRoy and Love were
transferred to the Washington city
jail early Wednesday evening.

Senior Rick Beardsley, Doscher’s

* By RICHARD HUMPHREY

Five students and five faculty
members have been named as
members of the University Senate
Conference Committee.

The committee has been formed
for the purpose of amending the cur-
rent University Senate document
for ratification by students and fac-
ulty.

The faculty representatives, ap-
pointed by the chairman of the fac-
ulty, are: George Folkers, associ-
ate professor of German; Charles
Jones, professor of education; Owen
Anderson, associate professor of
physics; William Snyder, assistant
professor of chemical engineering;
and James Turnure, professor of
art.

Student representatives, appoint-
ed by Bob Nachshin and Russ Pais,
include: Lou Bucceri, ABS repre-
sentative-at-large; Jack Schmidt,
editor-in-chief of The Bucknellian;
Jack Hart, president of the class of
1972; Russ Pais, vice-president of
ABS; and Bob Nachshin, president
of ABS.

Bob Nachshin, ABS president,
stated, ‘I hope the committee as a
whole will be responsive to a strong
University Senate with a great
share of responsibility granted to

the students.”’

When asked about the student
representatives’ attitudes toward
this responsibility, Lou Bucceri
said, “We intend to work closely as
we can with the faculty and main-
tain the integrity of the document.”’

Russ Pais commented, “I just
hope that the ten of us can prepare
a document that will serve the

share in America.’’ Lincoln appear-
ed at the University in conjunction
with this year’s third Afro-Ameri-
can symposium.

Lincoln further explained, “The
real problem in America today is
the institutions with a racist idea-
logy, such as the school, the church,
and the art gallery, as well as
people with a racist ideology, name-
ly parents of young white liberals.”

He stated that he distrusts any
coalition of the New Left and
lacks. ‘White radicals are sons
and daughters of the establishment.
While not impugning their serious-
ness, one can’t deny the attractive-
ness of their patrimony. In the past,
so-called radicals went home to be
‘right’ like their parents; blacks
cannot discount this possibility
among the New Left.”

He criticized the inability of white
America to see the racial crisis as
anything but the “colored situa-
tion.”

lem;’ they he re-
marked

Williams’ Metaphor of Memory
Conveyed by Sentimental Mood

By GREG PROWANT

Last night marked the opening
of Cap and Dagger’s production of
Tennessee Williams’ Glass Menag-
erie. The play is the memory of its
poet-narrator Tom Wingfield, a
character who closely resembles the
young Williams.

Williams has used the metaphor
of memory to create an atmosphere
that seems to reach for the deeper
meanings in reality, rather than
exact representations. In the play
we see a view of pre-World II

Mayday Events Include Rock Festival,
Presentation of Three Point Ultimatum

By JACK SCHMIDT

The Mayday Collective, coordi-
nators of the Washington Mayday
nonviolent civil-disobedience offen-
sive planned for May 1-5, announced
yesterday that they had secured
camping permits to use West Poto-
mac Park during this weekend’s
rock festival.

The permits alleviate the expected
problems had the government de-
manded the clearing of the park
during the night.

An ultimatum has
issued to

also been
government officials

which includes three demands which
must be met before May 1. If they
are not, the massive, nonviolent dis-
ruptions will go ahead as planned.

The demands ask Congress (1) to
plan for the immediate withdrawal
of all U.S. troops from Vietnam in
accordance with the People’s Peace
Treaty, (2) to provide for a guaran-
teed minimum annual income,
based on the scale of $6500 for a
family of four, and massive man-
power training and job creation pro-
grams, and (3) to free all political
prisoners.

If the demands are not met, key
intersections throughout Washing-
ton will be blocked, and in con-
junction with the People’s Coalition,
an attempt will be made to stop
Pentagon and Justice Departments
from functioning.

On May 5, all attention will be
centered on a massive, nonviolent
encirclement of Congress. The Col-
lective says, “We believe that the
Congress can stop the war if it
wants. We hope to make it impos-
sible for it to function unless the

America that rings true: crowded
tener s; the local delicatessen
and night spots; the intense fatigue
created by life in a world of mo-
notonous streets and meaningless
jobs that are just beyond the stage
setting. Such a life Tom Wingfield
yearns to escape, as his father had
done sixteen ye before. His
desertion would leave his mother
Amanda, a nagging, aging belle of
the old South, and his crippled
sister Laura to their own meager
resources. Laura is the single factor
restraining him: shy and fragile
like her treasured collection of
glass animals, she evokes in Tom’s
reflections a persistent mood of
great tenderness, gentle, yet sad
The appearance of a “gentleman
caller’? brings only transitory hope
and confidence for Laura in her
secluded, fragile world of glass.
Director Stuart White has tried
to convey in his production a senti-
mental, almost melodramatic mood.
This mood is set by the music,
taken from the original Broadway
production, and enhanced by the
maintenance of a slow, consistent
tempo. The almost too poignantly
vivid characterizations are counter-
ed by a sense of “picture frame’
distance from Tom’s memory.
This distance is maintained

Student Affairs and Counselors

Over the course of the past few
years the campus has undergone some
changes. Students are beginning to as-
sert more and more influence in the
planning and control of their own educa-
tional and social programs. However,
i the rules and policies of the Uni-

ity still restrict the freedom of stu-
dents, many times we find that students
must play an increasing role in the feed-
back process.

Underlying every set of policies
there must be certain organizational
goals which direct the planning function.
The University has never adequately de-
fined its purpose other than in vague
generalities. Until recently, most de-
cision makers thought that certain in-
formal objectives were sufficient to

id r progress. As a policy was

these vary from individual to individual,

they are expected to perform. As a conse-

and the administration, students must
have faith and confidence in him. Yet it
is alleged that when one counselor sought
information concerning the best way of
helping students on her floor who were
having problems with drugs, she was
strongly requested to reveal the names
of these individuals. Instead of ltreating
the matter confidentially, the adminis-
trator supposedly summoned the stu-
dents to Marts Hall for questioning.
What kind \of trust will the students in
this hall group have for their counselor
now? What kind of trust does the
counselor have for the administration
after the way in which this affair was
handled?

Students also wonder why freshmen
shold be segregated from the rest of
the college community. Clearly this ar-
rangement gives the administration
much more control over the kinds of in-
fluences upperclassmen have on fresh-
men. Most freshmen are in close contact
with only one upperclassman, their
Junior Counselor, for the first few
months at school. Since the student af-
fairs personnel determine which upper-
classmen are selected as counselors, they
are easily able to choose a type of stu-
dent who will conform to whatever image
they wish to project on the incoming
class.

The students affairs personnel must
have impetus to effect change. As a
first step in the feedback process, the
President of the A.B.S., has appointed
a special committee to investigate the
rationale underlying the present concepts
of student assistance held by the admin-
istration. Furthermore the methods em-
ployed in the selection of students to fill
these positions will be examined. We
feel that this step is long overdue.
Handled properly, this investigation
could directly influence the present views
held by the Student Affairs Staff.

This committee will also help to
clarify the views students hold concern-
ing counselors, residence assistants, and
the manners in which they are selected.
It may stimulate other student feedback
efforts designed to improve the planning
and execution of policy related to stu-
dent life. Without this type of control or
information the administrative policies
cannot be effectively geared towards the
improvement of student life.

Note: The following is to be chanted as a responsive reading, preferably
in the key of E-flat.)

Uniforms and songs have a way of associating with each other — per-
haps the singing of the latter helps to remove from one’s mind the op-
pression of the former. In preparation for Summer Camp, Rotcees have
been issued a booklet full of pleasant lyrics, to be sung or chanted while
marching, shooting, or otherwise acting all grown up:

“I want to be an Airborne Ranger.
I want to jump from big-assed planes.
I want to be an Airborne Ranger.
I got shit for brains.”
Somew re sophisticated are the songs of a different batallion:

GUEST COLUMN

BG Student’s Governments

By LOU BUCCERI

The status of student government at Bucknell has always been tenuous
at best. The majority of students on campus are rarely sure who has the
power to do what, nor why they have that power. In the past the Uni-
versity’s institutional structures seemed to rely on obscure traditions and
ancient policy decisions as their guide. Strangely enough, a movement to
change this situation began three years ago. Its goal was to create an
effective, responsive student government which would act on behalf of
the whole student body. The result was the Association of Bucknell Stu-
dents.

Any institutional change is difficult, but the ABS sometimes seems
to have more than its share of problems. This has largely been due to
a lack of unity on the part of the student body. The building of student
influence in University affairs requires the support of a unified student
population. Without unity, it will be impossible for us to gain any degree
of control over the institutions that currently regulate our lives.

Student apathy is, of course, one source of the problem. It can only
be ended as a result of a continuing effort to deal with the issues whiich are
central to student life. The ABS has shown its dedication in this area

went out, tables were set up in
the Freshman cafeteria, notes were
published in The Bucknellian, and
announcements were made on WB-
VU.

What you may ask, were the re-
sults of all this planning and work?
First, the response was virtually
non-existent until Thursday, April
22. We had asked for immediate
response in all of our announce-
ments and yet by Monday, April 19,
the day we had to confirm the bus
reservations, only ten people had
signed up. . -

This fact is bad enough in itself,
but furthermore, the aggravation
and frustration appeared in full
force on Thursday night, April 22.
Many people called up asking what
time the busses were leaving. . .

As it was, we managed to
scrounge for rides, and most of
the people who wanted to go got
there by car or by thumb. It would
obviously have been much easier if
the people who wanted to go by
bus the day before the march had
called us in time to order more
busses.

There is one last thing we would
like to mention. About three hours
after the signs were put up, most
of them had been ripped down.
This only demonstrates to us a
lack of understanding, and possibly
a fear af the consequences of such
a march. If the person (or persons)
who engaged in this suppression of
free thought and lawful dissent, is
man enough to speak to us about
his action, we would be more than
willing to discuss anything he
wishes.

Autonomy

To the Editor:

Every time one picks up The
Bucknellian, the page is mottled
with stories concerning the rights
of individuals within the dormitory.
There have been questionnaires,
policy statements from dorm coun-
cils, ABS motions, and rationales
ad nauseum.

We, however, fail to perceive a
problem, and furthermore,we sub-
mit that there is no problem.

It is common knowledge that
there are many individuals, perhaps
a majority, who have been living
their lives independently of Uni-
versity regulations. For example,
men and women have been sleeping
together in University residences at
will. Be that as it may, why all the
furor over dormitory regulations
when in reality Bucknell men and
women regulate themselves?

Since this has been the state of
affairs, and, since it undoubtedly
will continue to be (at least on our
hall), we felt it incumbent upon
ourselves to acknowledge reality,
and, hence, our only recourse is to
declare openly that our floor is
autonomous.

Baseball

To the Editor:

Maybe the baseball coach, Tom-
my Thompson, should stop and
think about changing his policy
governing team tryouts each year.
Upon returning to school at the
beginning of February for the start
of second semester, I called Coach
Thompson to find out when base-
ball tryouts were going to be held.
At that time he informed me that
tryouts were by invitation only,
with invitations going to those stu-
dents who had played ball in the
past, either on the Freshman or
Varsity teams. Such a policy seems
both uncompetitive and unwise.
There may be several students at
this school who have quite a talent
for playing baseball, but because
of one reason or another are not
able to go out for the team until
their junior or senior year. It is
not only unfair that such students
do not have a chance to tryout,
but equally, irrational since real
talent that might be used to the
team’s advantage may be going
unnoticed. Therefore, I ask that
Coach Thompson consider altering
his present policy to insure a
thorough and competitive baseball
tryout period involving all students
at the school who are so interested.

Apathetics

To the Editor

(In reply to D. Flanagan’s letter.)

I am always amazed at how well
some college students read. As
regards Mr. Flanagan, I can only
recommend that a refresher course
be taken. If he goes back and re-
reads my article he will find that
nowhere in it do I call those who
voted against the treaty apathetic;
however the fact that Mr. Flana-
gan read this into my column in
dicates some kind of guilt complex
on his part

In my article I simply listed the
three kinds of people I had witnes-
sed — the apathetics being one of
them. More spe ally I never
even addressed myself to this group,
(they aren’t worth the effort), and
rather, referred only to the “‘anti-
war, anti-governmental-politicians,”
and the ‘“‘America the Beautiful’
groups

You Mr. Flanagan I place in the
latter group, and no doubt you like
being put there. You say you read
the treat I would ask you this
did yc he referendum ques:
tion on I sincerely doubt
it

I can only hope (from one Mas-
sachusettsite to another) that o'
the next three years of your Buc
nell existence you come to realiz
that if the people of this land don’t
start to make our government listen
to those people, our “‘of, by, and for
the people’ constitution can be
thrown in the garbage

“The terms ‘nigger,’ ‘Negro,’ and

What you should know about diamonds
when you know it’s for keeps

You've dreamed about your
diamond engagement ring a thou-
sand times. But now that you
know it’s for keeps, it’s time to
stop dreaming and start learning
about diamonds and their value.

Because no two diamonds
are exactly alike, jewelers have
adopted exacting standards to de-
termine the relative value of each
and every diamond in the world.
These standards include a dia-
mond’s size (carat weight), color,
cut and clarity.

ASTROLITE

COLOR: Fine white diamonds are
quite rare and valued accordingly.
Other shades in relative order of
their worth are: blue, yellow,
brown and black.

CUT: The cut of a diamond—the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—brings out the gem’s fire
and brilliance. Anything less than
correct cut reduces beauty, bril-
liance and value.

CLARITY: Determined by the ab-
sence of small impurities. A per-
fect diamond has no impurities
when examined under ten power
magnification by a trained eye.

CARAT: A _ diamond’s size
ured in carats. As a diamond
ses in size, its price will
increase even more if the quality
remains constant. But larger dia-
monds of inferior quality may ac-
tually be worth less than smaller,

Although it’s important to
know the facts about diamonds,
you certainly don’t have to be an
expert to choose a Keepsake Dia-
mond Ring . . . because Keepsake
guarantees a diamond of fine white
color, correct cut and perfect clar-
ity or replacement assured. The fa-
mous Keepsake certificate provides
permanent registration, trade-in
value and protection against loss
of diamonds from the setting.

Critic Condemns ‘Your Own Thing’;
Labels It ‘Commercial and ‘Phony’

By HOWARD ASHMAN

Hippies are big business. The
Disney studios recently re-issued
Fantasia on the premise that Walt
Disney was ‘‘on their side’ in the
early nineteen forties. Considering
the stoned ‘“‘oh wows” and glowing
student reviews those pirouetting
mushrooms received, it is not sur-
prising that the Bucknell audience
took Your Own Thing to its 1957
heart.

Your Own Thing is an extended
Pepsi commercial. It is more of
television (especially its slick,
youth-oriented commercials) than
of theatre. Remember how Pepsi
was recommended “for those who
think young,” and later to the
“Pepsi Generation?’’ Remember
the billboards urging us to “Come
Alive?” Well, Your Own Thing
speaks in that idiom.

It is commercial from the top of
its Beatle haircut to the tip of its
vinyl-booted toe. Now, there’s noth-
ing wrong with being commercial
Hello Dolly is commercial and bril-
liant. Cabaret is commercial and
devastating. But Your Own Thing
is a phony.

It purports to be a rock-musical,
but its music is neither rock nor
musical comedy. It is the kind of
music that sells Ban-Roll-On.

It purports to be a picture of
“youth on the go,” but it is merely
Madison Avenue’s version of hippies
cirea 1967. Treated with the right
tone it could poke fun at all that.
The production that came to Davis
Gym on April 24th did not.

While the show was professionally
mounted, (indeed, one of the slick-
est “bus and truck”’ companies I’ve
ever seen) one felt the cast was
aware ‘that it was performing drivel
and was exerting enormous energy
to compensate. That energy was
misdirected. Songs came out with
the hip over-emotionalism of Jim
Nabors singing “Let It Be.”

Since Oklahoma, the American
musical has been built on the in-

tegration of action and song. In
Your Own Thing songs have only
the loosest connection with the plot.
They reiterate rather than illumin.

good effect. Brecht knew how to
stop the action and comment on it
in seemingly irrelevant song. But

dience must be in on the joke.

It’s too bad, because rarely are
college touring companies of this
kind graced with such fine voices.
But what good are fine voices, ade-
quate dancing, and passable de-
livery when a show is a fraud.

Who can enjoy them when they
are used to take advantage of a
naive audience?

most definitely not in on this par-
ticular hoax. They cheered, stomp
ed, and shouted “‘right-on’’ at lines
like, ‘““You can’t tell the boys from
the girls.” Perhaps this was an
audience conditioned by television
to respond to this kind of watered-
down “relevance.”

But the topicality of Your Own

the audience’s reaction, one would

duction: Jim Lyon’s set instills in
us a constant reminder that we
are watching something that is no
longer existent; it is just an illusion,
floating in black velour. With light-
ing, Rick Gardner has done an ex-
cellent job of creating that plastic,
hazy mood of the world of mem-
ories. And as it is Tom’s play,
truths which are important to his
rationalization are punctuated by
shafts of light which are directed
quite often to a picture of his father
on the wall.

As narrator and a character in
his own story, Tom, played by
Howard Ashman, is a very complex
character. Narrating, he brings the
audience comfortably into his story
There, his inner conflict between the
desires to leave and his concern
for Laura are portrayed with near
brilliance.

A difficult role to present without
falling into stereotype is that of
Amanda, who constantly relives past
glories, unable to face present facts.
Janet Cunningham, though new to
the Bucknell stage, handles the role
quite well: her projection, faci
pressions, and even her gait <
walks across stage are all consis-
tant with the confused vitality of
Amanda

Several of the most important
lines spoken by the timid Laura are
said so faintly by Nancy Henry
that they are barely audible. This,
however, is all that is necessary,
for she seems to have the audience
sympathetically holding their breath
in order to hear every line. She

While originally described by
Williams as an “ordinary young

production, played by Trevor Lewis,
is refreshingly anything but ordin-

comic; he is deflated by his in-

tertiary treatment.

A $1.5 million plant to treat acid
water from the mines before it
enters the river is now being con-
structed by the State and paid for
by the coal companies on Rausch
Creek in Schuylkill County, and
similar plants are being planned for
Shamokin Creek and other streams.

Solid waste disposal has also been
a problem since most of the land-
fills in this area have been little
better than dumps. This problem is
soon to be remedied, however, by
a system of true sanitary landfills
which has been planned for the
area by the Susquehanna Economic
Development sociation.

One problem which will not be
soon solved is the effect which strip
mining has had. Besides polluting
streams it has defaced the country-

Pollution

The Susquehanna river and its
tributaries are badly polluted with
mine acid and with untreated and
inadequately treated sewage.

the Susquehanna at Sunbury, is an

tion of Interstate 80, which is now
the main artery of traffic between
New York City and the West. Since
Route 15 is the main corridor be-
tween Buffalo and Washington, D.
C., Lewisburg now has a quite stra-
tegic location.

Another factor accounting for this
anticipated growth is the increasing
desire of businesses to migrate
from troubled urban areas to the
suburbs and rural areas.

This trend is encouraged by
numerous organizations, such as
the Central Susquehanna Valley
Chamber of Commerce and the in-
dustrial development associations
of many communities and counties.
P.P. & L. has also engaged in the
effort to attract industry by pur-
chasing potential industrial sites
and providing them with the neces-
sary services.

Industry

The influx of industry so far has
greatly relieved the former un-
employment problem and has cre-
ated a stable, diversified industrial
base. But with unemployment now
largely confined to a few communi-
ties who have recently lost a major
employer, a few people doubt that
continued growth is desirable.

Dr. Richard Nickelsen, Professor
of Geology, for example, looks skep-
tically upon the “desirability of a

constantly expanding GNP.” He be-
lieves that this area’s growth will
“benefit only those few landowners
who sell their property to develop-
ers, while the rest of us see the
quality of life we now enjoy being
destroyed by air, water, visual and
noise pollution, and the elimination
of open spaces.”

No amount of industrial develop-
ment, Dr. Nickelsen feels, can
eliminate unemployment altogether,
since more people than can be em-
ployed will always gravitate towards
a developing area.

He believes the main environ-
mental goal here should be ‘“‘main-
taining the unique natural beauty
of the region.’ For this, “the only
growth tolerable is planned
growth,” but zero growth would be
better. The prospects for this, he
concedes, are extremely dim.

One of the main points of Dr.
Anderson’s report is that the area’s.
anticipated growth is not even
being well planned. The report
shows that most people are happy
with Lewisburg as it is but are un-
aware of the forces for change
which are at work. The report con-
q s: “Unless we begin to think
about where we are going, few of
us will be happy with Lewisburg in
1980.”

Lack of planning shows up in

ehanna Valley Region

various ways. The commercial strip
developments along Route 15 north
ot Lewisburg and in other places
have created visual pollution and
also an inefficient highway. Thus a
new highway may eventually have
to be constructed parallel to the
present one in these areas.

Residential strip development,
such as that along Route 45 be
tween Lewisburg and Mifflinburg,
creates the same problem, and also
makes it more difficult for these
homes to be supplied with electrical
and sewer services.

Another question raised in Dr.
Anderson’s report is how housing
could be provided for a large popu-
lation increase. The soaring prices
of single-family dwellings could
make modular housing units and
mobile homes the only possibility.
Little thought has been given to the
desirability of this solution.

George Fasic, planning specialist
for the Union-Snyder County Puan-
ning Commission, believes that at-
tracting industry to the area has
been overemphasized at the expense
of other modes of solving area
problems. Most people, including
many elected officials and business-
men, remain unaware of the ques-
tions that must be asked, and may
not become aware until a state of
crisis has occurred.

‘Owl and the Pussycat’ Succeeds
As Co-stars Overcome Its Flaws

By DAN MARTIN

The Owl and the Pussycat is a
truly enjoyable film with many good
points and many flaws.

Let’s start with the flaws. I sup-
pose an apparently noticable one
would be the plot itself, a some-
what unfathomable tale of a bumbl-
ing intellectual (George Segal) and
a New York prostitute (Barbra
Streisand) who get together under
unlikely circumstances and fall in
love. Complicated by the constant
conflict of ‘“mind’’ versus “body,”
the pair nevertheless learn to recon-
cile their differences, and come to
an understanding after which they
presumably live happily ever after.

Given the above circumstances, I
don’t think that anyone with an
ounce of taste would admit that
they independently constitute an
exciting movie. Luckily those cir-
cumstances, as in the plot of any

film, do not stand alone, relegating
this criticism to a comparatively
minor place.

A more valid objection, however,
could be leveled at Buck Henry’s
screenplay: unquestionably funny,
but most questionably realistic. Ig-
noring the few undeniably horrible
sequences, such as the leering
lechers in the pornographic movie-
house where Segal goes to see Miiss
Streisand’s film, or the closing
scene in which Segal has Streisand
playing go fetch, the dialogue is
at times too quick and too manu-
factured. There are moments, in
fact, when Miss Streisand’s obscene
witticisms are just too rapid fire
for us to take sitting down (I
stayed to see the movie through
twice to catch them all).

Which brings us to another ques-
tion, one of more personal taste-
whether or not Barbra comes off
in this new role. Personally I think
she does, and does it in a manner
that can only add complements to
her fame as an established come-
dienne. Granted, she’s gotten carl
ried away lately with her roles in
musical extravaganzas. But I stand

by my claim that Miss Streisand’s
comic nature is her best, and it is
that nature which is successfully
revealed in The Owl and the Pussy-
cat.

Well, I had a feeling when I sat
down to review this film, that 1
couldn’t keep up my criticism for
long. The fact is that The Owl and
the Pussycat is one of the most
enjoyable comedies I’ve seen in
months, and I sat through it twice
most importantly for the sake of
pure enjoyment.

As long as we're classifying, the
biggest plus for the film is Mr.
Segal-undoubetdly one of the best
character actors in the business to-
day. Squeezing everything human
out of his frustrated writer, Segal
presents here his mastery of the
ability to portray a laughably weak
character and still come out on top.
Even more impressive than that, is
his unbelievable success in keeping
up with the widely recognized vigor
and pace of his co-star.

‘And it is herein that lies much of
Miss Streisand’s success. Due un-
doubtedly to the skill of Mr. Segal,
this is the first time I can remem-
per that Barbra has failed to over-
power and completely suffocate her
male star. If anything, it seems
that in the moments when she does
get carried away, she seems glar-
ingly out of line and is called back
by Segal. The end result of all this
is a delightful duet, with the two
partners constantly complementing
each other and keeping each other
in place.

A final thing that always has to
be dealt with in cinema today is

“the message,” which happens to
be light and happy in this film, but
nonetheless significant. Perhaps the
whole point of The Owl and the
Pussycat is jokingly offered by Miss
Streisand as she tells Segal about
a psychiatrist she went to who told
her that she should do anything she
wanted, as long as it didn’t make
her unhappy. When she didn’t pay
him, it made her happy as hell, but
| not him. Whether or not that sums
it up, the treatments of life that

Streisand offers to Segal to bring
| him back to humanity, does. For us,
| I'd prescribe one dose of this film,
| a medicine that might offer some
| cure for the weekend’s monotony.

NEWS OF PARENTS WEEKEND EARLY

CUBBY, KAREN, VORTEX

BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA

Prof. Roy Rufus

Jethro “Boy” Goffer, Professor of Baroque Literature, found Parent’s
Weekend his most lucrative in months. The parents were apparently very
appreciative not only of the fine luster he gave to their shoes, but also
of his talent of beating out snappy rhythms while buffing them. As
always, Prof Goffer will donate the money to the ammunition fund of

the Panthers.

Smackmen and Fornos
Trounced by Blue Boys

By FLRAN SEPPEL

The largest drug raid of the week
took place on Saturday. Four hun-
dred students, twenty-seven faculty
members and nine trustees were
arrested.

Bail was posted at seven million
dollars, the highest ever. Few stu-
dents were able to raise the money;
the trustees, released in a matter
of hours, promised to help raise the
money, however.

The raid took place at two in the
afternoon, in Davis Gymnasium
where the crowd had gathered for
its daily ‘‘Shoot-Up and Sex” party.
The busloads of prostitutes had not
yet arrived, although the Com-

Fly Zips In and Up

By WILLIAM CHANIZ

A freshman, mysteriously known
only as “The Human Fly,” made
his formal debut on Sunday when,
in honor of Parent’s Weekend, he
became the first man to “conquer
the University Center.”

Before a crowd of several hun-
dred, the Human Fly scaled the
sheer eighty foot monument without
the help of ropes or any kind of
support. In an amazing display of
strength and agility, the Fly
grasped the small indented concrete
areas surrounding each brick, and
wriggled his way to the top.

Dressed in a tight-fitting orange
and blue uniform, complete with
a cowl for his face so that we may
only guess at his identity, the Fly
became an instant hero when he
answered the cries of “jump” by
leaping off the building, landing
safely in the fountain on the Quad.

Yarious members of the com-
munity had observed the Fly train-
ing for the event by climbing up
trees in the Sem, only to lower him-
self down again by the sheerest of
ropes. There is some speculation
that the Fly is the same person re-
portedly sighted sleeping on the side
of the water tower.

The Fly indicated that he would
return in the near future. Having
climbed the largest building on
campus, he promised that his next
challenge would consist of the at-
tempt to climb the sheer walls of
a building that is still only on the
drawing boards.

It is rumored that the fly is an ex-
skydiver who found that sport too
easily conquered, so he headed in
the reverse direction. “Heck, sky
diving is as easy as falling off a
log,” he once said.

munists had begun showing their
Anti-American films, when the boys
in blue arrived. The animals for
the “Bestiality Parade” were found
in compromising positions, adding
another possible count to the ex-
pected indictment.

Although the largest in numbers,
this raid did not exceed the record
in terms of quantity of illegal sub-
stances confiscated. That record is
held by the raid two days ago
when thirty pounds of heroin, ear-
marked for the ‘Neighborhood
Children’s Breakfast Program,”
was found, along with four thousand
dirty syringes and nine crates of
pornographic T-Shirts.

A small shoot-out occurred when
one of the faculty attempted to
escape. He was mowed down by a
group of students who felt that he
was “Copping out.” One was heard
to shout after the murder, ‘‘An-
other blow for Relevancy!”

It is suspected that several top
student leaders of the campus
Mafia-SDS coalition were picked up
in the crowd. This may slow down
the razing of the University that
has been in progress since last
spring.

The townspeople, upset by the
recent anti-Catholic pogrom, are
expected to pressure the local po-
lice chief to continue cracking down
on the students. But the students
have pledged to ‘‘Sacrifice by sex-
ual Abuse” two of the town's child-
ren for every student harassed.”

Fish Cake Walk

By VICKI VOCKI

Today, in an environment action
that surprised many with its mili-
tancy, fish from the Susquehanna
River crawled up on land and beat
on Mr, Geiger, head of the Physical
Plant.

Tim Storieonk, president of the
Bucknell Students For Clean Every-
thing, expressed dismay that the
fish had not consulted his group be-
fore the action. ‘“‘We were taken
completely aback, and were totally
afronted.””

Storieonk said that Operation
Springtime would go ahead as plan-
ned. Operation Springtime is an at-
tempt to keep Bucknell prepetually
in that season.

Students will canvass all of Lewis-
burg, handing leaflets out to all
trees. The leaflets warn the trees
against shedding their leaves in fall,
under threat of “finding yourself
picking someone's teeth in a greasy
diner on Rout 15.”

Watts and Golden Calt
Ride Wave of Futurity

President Watts addressed the
Parents Saturday, stressing the roll
of the University in the “Wave of
Futurity.”

Dressed in a demure gorilla suit,
the president welcomed the parents,
saying, “It sure is a pleasure to
see so many of you here. I wouldn't
say that there are a lot of you here,
but the people in the back are eat-
ing borscht.”

He then stated the theme of the
talk, “But seriously, if you think
this room is small, you ought to see
the freshman dorm rooms. Why
those rooms are so small that a
freshman put a key into the lock,
and broke a window.

“Why, I wouldn’t say that those
rooms are small, but, but even the
mice are hunchbacked. They're so
small that you have to leave the
room to change your mind. I
wouldn’t say they’re small, but
they had to put the lampshades on
the bottom of the bulbs, and the
light switches have to operate side-
ways. I wouldn’t say they’re small,
but when you finally get into your
bed, the door knob gets in with you

“Finally, this freshman kid lay

Clowns Smirk

By SACCO DOTAL

Parents this weekend expressed
surprise at the four hundred student
clowns wandering around the cam-
pus.

The clowns, students elected to
that position because of high aca-
demic achievement, or some other
outstanding quality, expressed re-
ciprocal surprise at the parent’s re-
action. As one was heard to com-
ment, “Jeez, you'd think they had
forgotten that we ever existed.”

As usual, the clowns, dressed in
their homemade outfits, rode
around campus, throwing marsh-
mallows at whoever ignored them,
talking in voices two octaves higher
than normal, beeping their “magic
horus” whenever there was a
silence.

The parent’s expressed a mixture
of shock, amusement and outrage.
“After all,” said one father, “I
didn’t send my son here to become
a clown! He’s here to learn the
ropes of the trade.”

Another typical reaction was
stated by one mother who sat in the
Bison over a coke and hamburger.
She said, ‘‘Gee, I don’t really under-
stand it, but I guess we just have
to accept what the kids are doing
today. After all, we made such a
mess of the world, maybe they can
teach us something.”

Some parents could not help but
contain their mirth at the Annual
Dance and Rainmaker held in a
tent on the soccer field when a con-
tingent of forty clowns swallowed
Ronnie Dio, the bandleader.

tomy between a luxury institution
and community in which it may be
located. ‘‘Well, let me tell you that
he was outraged.”

Continuing, talking of the need
for personal answers to personal
questions, President Watts said, “So
he marched down to the Head Resi-
dent and said angrily, ‘There are
two rats fighting in the middle of
my floor!’ ”

About the unfortunate necessity
of high tuition, Watts concluded, “So
the Head Resident turned to him
and said, “For four hundred dollars
a year, you expect maybe a bull
fight?”

speech was swift and unanimous.

Calf Bone

By SALLACE KORK

At a special ceremony, lead by
President Watts and Chaplain
Gardner, parents watched the un-
veiling of the new monument do-
nated by the class of 1956.

Gathered together on the only
patch of land left of what was once
known as The Hill, the crowd heard
Chaplain Gardner give the invoca-
tion as the President of the Alumni
Association pulled the string that
ripped the veils from the shining
Golden Calf.

“We ask Thy blessing on this
humble work, that it might serve
as an inspiration to all future Buck-
nellians that grace this fair Uni-
versity,” The chaplain said sancti-
moniously

President Watts made a similar
invocation, substituting the Truste-
es for God.

The statue was donated by the
Class of 1956 to “‘symbolize some-
thing,” in the words of the Presi-
dent of Alumni Everywhere. “Be-
sides, it was either that or a five
pound box of chocolates and some
flowers.”

Toes Tap Fred Astaire

By BROCKMAN TUBER
This weekend saw three theatrical events of uneven quality. A de-
light to the ear was the new background music; a treat to all the senses
was the performance by Jed Macky and The Stumpers. And the pro-

duction number on the hill was its usual dull self.
The background music for the weekend was changed from its normal
fare in honor of the parents. The Steering Committee decided that the
usual minuet music on the quad, and the “Thus Spake Zarathustra” in

the Bison were a bit too heavy for

the parents.

Instead the committee opted for replacement of the orchestra through-
out the campus by accordian-saxophone duets, which played Italian Wed-

ding Music and the theme from “My

Three Sons.” The idea was a stroke

of genius, although we think a few more flute players in the bushes might

have provided more of the sense of
the campus.

mystery of the East which prevades

But really, must we suffer through another spontaneous production

number? As usual, a

student walking down the hill got the urge and

yelled, ‘Take me to Park Avenue, Kids!”

The chorus line, this time dissapointingly only two-hundred students
long, danced out from behind the shrubbery and sang, ‘“Let’s Go Slumm-
ing, From the Bowery to Park Avenue.”

The kicking was less than precise, and although the joy and spirit
seemed to be there, we can only wonder how much longer this stillness
will go on before it becomes stultified into a tradition.

Addenda and Pudenda

By RUDOLPH FRIML

The Dept. of Physics held a lec-
ture for the parents this weekend,
at which time it released some of
its most ‘“‘amazing Science Facts.”
The parents expressed benign in-
terest.

The Dept. announced that the
world’s heaviest rain occurred at
the bottom of the ocean. In fact, it
is still raining there right at this
very moment.

The Department also said that
the Hudson Think Tank had recent-
ly discovered a way to count var-
ious fruit conglomorations, disprov-
ing the old saw that you cannot
add apples and oranges. The par-
ents applauded.

As a footnote, the spokesman
added, with an obvious note of dis-
appointment, that as yet no way
to get a hard-boiled egg out of a
milk bottle has been found.

The spokesman said that the
world’s largest plant is not a giant
redwood in California, but was
rather, as of February first of this
year, the Detroit General Motors
factory. “Progress is our baby, our
only baby’? he quipped.

Sigma Alpha Mu, in its annual
Bounce for Beats, this weekend sur-
prised parents with more than re
quests for money for charity.

This year, the Sammies bounced
parents instead of basketballs, drag-
ging them out of their cars, and
sending their cadillacs over the side
of the road into the creek by the
Bison.

The money will be used to buy
narcotics and women of easy vir-
tue for an orphanage.

Diamondmen Defeat Dickinson Big Blue Laxmen Explode
With Exciting 9th Inning Rally

By KEN DOAK

A ninth inning home-run by Chris
Riley gave the Bisons a 7-6 triumph
over Dickinson Tuesday in a tre-
mendously exciting and unpredict-
able game

lead after three innings as they

A Dickinson error, and singles by
Eck and Jay Sabatino loaded the

bases.

Mike Marinchak then followed with
three line shots to the outfield to
jump the Herd into a 6-4 lead.

The four runs in that inning sur-
passed the team production for any
previous game.

Bill Lane then replaced Rich
Baines, who had pitched 4 scoreless
innings. He breezed through the
next five batters and seemingly had
a victory wrapped up. However,
nothing is ever certain with the
Bisons, as the next two batters
proved

Paul Wagner, with two strikes on
him, belted one that did not stop
rolling until it bounced off the

isty Mathewson Gateway, and he
coasted around the bases. Lou Lo-
quasto followed with a towering shot

over the fence in left field, also on
a 2-strike pitch, and the score was
5-7

Rudolph added a bit of excite-
ment as he led off the bottom of the
ninth with a double and was nailed
trying to stretch it. However, Riley
quickly drove a line-drive to deep-
est left-center and legged it all the
way for the game-winner to help
erase the pained look on Coach
Thompson’s face.

Hopefully, the base hit barrage
will bring the Bison batters out of
their slump, and Rudolph (.359) and
Gene Luccarelli (.333) may get
some offensive help.

Records were shattered as the BU
laxmen defeated winless Dickinson,
at home Wednesday, 20-6.

Co-captain Lou Kissling set a new
mark with ten points in the game,
on four goals and six assists. Junior
Dan Nourse tied the single game
record for goals with six. Finally,
the team score of twenty goals set
a new mark.

The Herd led from the start as
they mounted a 5-1 lead at the
quarter. BU increased the margin
to 12-2 at the half and 15-3 after
three periods.

Throughout the last period Coach
Sid Jamieson substituted freely,
but the Bisons still outscored Dick-
inson 5-3.

Although Nourse tied the single
game record for goals, he still felt
this was far from his best
game.

‘A Very Significant Thing’;
Faculty Votes to Open FAC

y JUNE CAFFREY

At the faculty meeting last night
a motion which changes the struc-
ture of the Faculty Advisory Com-
mittee was passed by a vote of
53-41,

The motion, proposed by Stephen

assistant professor of

s, provides that the 5 or 6

vacancies each year shall be filled

by candidates at large (i. e. there

would be no requirement concern-

ing department, division, or college
affiliation).

“This is a very significant motion
the faculty just passed,” Provost
Wendell Smith commented. The new
voting system will alleviate the
departmentalization which was
characteristic of the old system.

“I have noticed intense depart-
mentalization of the faculty and
feel that Professor Becker’s motion
will aid in breaking it up,” observed
Richard Henry, chairman of the
physics department.

Gene Chenoweth, chairman of the
political science department, spoke
in favor of the motion and noted
that, “The at-large approach is
much better all around.” It allows
for the possibility of minority as
well as majority representation of
the faculty.

David Ray, coordinator of grad-
uate studies and professor of math-
ematics, reported on his committee
which is investigating the use of the
campus by outside agencies

The main purpose of the commit-
tee is to clarify the issues and de-
note the implications of this use for
the University community

The committee’s investigation will
center around the Boyd Douglas
issue. Ray said the committee will
explore the question of whether cer-

tain individuals’ academic freedom
and personal rights had been en-
dangered

The final report will be issued at
the December 1971 meeting.

Mildred Martin, professor of
English, proposed that the faculty
create an International Education
Committee. The motion passed after
some discussion.

The purpose of this committee
will be to coordinate all activities
relating to foreign study at the Uni-
versity. It will be composed of 13
members including three academic
deans and one student.

Herbert Eckberg, Dean of the
College of Engineering, noted that,
“Within the next few years, there
will be an increasing need for co-
ordination of information concern-
ing among other things, the amount
and sources of funds available for
studying abroad and acquiriing
foreign students at the University.”

The faculty voted to recess for
one week. Topics for next week’s

meeting will include the physical
education requirement and a reso-
lution that the relationship between
professor and stulent be considered

‘Vision of Christ’ Deemed
Medieval Mystery Play, 1971

By MICHAEL PAYNE
Vision of Christ is a
poetic revelation in which, as in its
fourteenth-century source, the in-
timacy of religious and imaginative
ecstacy is offered to be shared as
a communal experience. The dy-
namics of the work range from the
personal realm of man’s sin, his
fear of death and damnation, and
his hope to imitate in fact Christ’s
resurrection to the communal realm
of grace, love, and peace
These two realms merge in the
“mirroring mind” of the Poet,
whose consciousness is fragmented
into all of the separate identities
in the poetic drama. The center of
the work, then, is the Poet, whose

work of

are much less perceptive than a
medieval audience, for the relation-
ship between the audience and a
play appears to have undergone a
complete inversion since the four-
teenth century. It has been said of
medieval drama that “while the
performance lasted, audience and
actors shared the same ritual world,
a world more real than the one
which existed outside its frame.”
Similarily, in the Prologue to
fision of Christ the Poet tells us,

r you tillers and toilers I pro-
vide with rare Truth.”

The “rare Truth’ of the Vision
comes to us through a series of
transformations. The first medieval

vision takes the ancient form of
psychomachia, which allows for the
projection of parts of his mind into
a series of dramatic characters
whose interaction constitutes the
working of his mind as it creates
and renders his vision.

The aesthetic risks involved in of-
fering such a poetic drama “‘on the
order of a mystery play, 1970-71”
are tremendous. The creators of
Piers Plowman and the medieval
mystery plays could assume much
more about their audiences than
can be assumed about a modern
audience.

In our receptiveness to the ex-
periences of myth and ritual, we

cess gives us one of the most mag-
nificent lines in the poem: ‘For
Christ was a knight, courageous, a
King’s son.”

The second transformation recasts
the medieval experiences in modern
terms, but here the transformation
is no longer primarily visionary;
now it is the modern idiom in the
verse — “Then sighing sad Satan
spoke to his gang’? — and even
more obviously the modern tonali-
ties and rhythms in the music which
bring the traditional into conjunc-
tion with the contemporary.

The third transformation, of
course, is what gives us the per-

BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA —

Mayday Memorial Service
Marks Strike Anniversary

By RICHARD HUMPHREY

A Mayday memorial service will
be held Wednesday, May 5, from
1:00 p.m. until 2:30 p.m. on the
Academic Quad.

The service will be held to com-
memorate the lives of the Kent
State and Jackson State students
which were lost in protest of the
widening war in Indochina.

This commemoration will be real-

ized through the joint efforts of the
Association of Bucknell Students
and the Bucknell Students for
Peace.

The Peoples Coalition is calling
for a nationwide moratorium on
business as usual May 5.

3etsy Sandel, chairman of the
Mayday campus committee, stated,
“It is hoped that there will be no
‘business as usual’ this Wednesday.”’

Controversy Continues

JC’s Uncertain about Their Role

the names of the residence halls
personnel for next year, the con-
troversy over the performance and
counselor selection methods of the
Office of University Residence Halls
has increased

Initially, there seems to be a glar-
ing lack of communication between
the counselors and the residence
directors. In the freshman dorms,
counselors’ meetings are either un-

roductive or non-existent.

Supposedly, the problems that are
making freshmen uncomfortable
are very seldom discussed and,
consequently, morale is low.

Further, several staff members
from Marts Hall used to visit the
counselors last year, but those visits
have been terminated

There is at least one reported in-
cident of a counselor being down-
graded by a head resident in front
of his hall group

As for responsibility, the coun-
selor in the past was expected to be
a social coordinator, but that as-
pect of the job has been down-
played

Freshman counselors also did not
participate in this year’s Freshman
Orientation program and, thus,
were unable to answer many ques-
tions

At the end of this year, the fresh-
men were asked to evaluate their
counselor. As unreliable as it may
be, this seems to be the only kind
of evaluation that is formally done.

Finally, several counselors have
the feeling that they are supposed
to be policemen, but they have re
jected this role

Mexican-American
Joins Psych Staff

By NANCY GRDEN

Enrique J. Abordo has received
the faculty position of assistant pro-
fessor of psychology, effective this
September.

He will be teaching two sections
of general psychology, as well as
a course in abnormal psychology.

“Dr. Abordo plans to reorganize
the general course so that they in-
clude field experience,” stated Dr.
Douglas Candland, chairman of the
psychology department. “It is
hoped that students will learn about
psychology by seeing what a psy-
chologist does.”

Abordo received his A.B. from
Loyola University of Los Angeles
in 1962 and his M.A. from San
Diego State College in 1964. He re-
ceived his Ph.D. from the Uni-
versity of California last December.

His most recent faculty position
has been assistant professor of
psychology at Reed College.

“Although Dr. Abordo is more
than familiar with the Mexican-
American communities in southern

California,” Dr. Candland stated,
“he is coming to the University be-
cause he feels that it offers him the
best opportunity for professional
development, and we are pleased
to have him here for that reason.”

Dr. Abordo hopes to do research
in the fields of child psychology
and primate learning, especially at
the child study mobile unit center,
which will be opening in the fall
next to the psychology lab.

“Dr. Abordo is interested in the
field of problem solving and concept
formation in children and the Great
Apes,’’ Dr. Candland continued.

“His current interest is with how
blind children solve problems be-
cause one of their sensory systems
is removed from perception.”

“Dr. Abordo did his work for his
master’s and doctoral degrees on
how human beings and primates
solve novel problems, and his pro-
cedures for study have led other
researchers to reorganize their ap-
proach to this area.”

Senior biology major Ken Dang-
man lost an entire set of lecture
notes, research, and materials for
his honors thesis in the fire. Tech-
nical assistant Thomas Maxon also
lost much of his research work.

Biology professor Jack Harclerode
relate “There was extensive
smoke damage in all of the labs
and offices. Electrical power was
lost temporarily on all floors of the
building. Smoke and water damage
resulted in the smudging of nearly
all the glassware in the building.”

The fire alarm rang at 8:30 a.m.
Sunday, but officials feel that the
fire had been burning for at least
an hour before that. At the time of
the alarm, the night watchman had
already left, and reportedly, no one
was in the building.

Fire officials found a burned-out
circuit breaker on the second floor.
However, they felt that until there
was a more thorough investigation,
the fire could not be attributed to
any specific electrical cause.

Two general biology labs and two
organismal physiology classes were
cancelled on Monday. However,
Harclerode expressed his convic-
tion that the biology program would
be operating on schedule today.

“The physical plant people and

the Lewisburg firemen have been
exceedingly cooperative,”’ he stated.
“Twenty or more people from the
physical plant worked in the build-
ing all day Monday. A number of
people have also volunteered their
services.”

University officials have not yet
estimated the cost of the damage.

Alternative Treaty

To the Editor

Bucknell students voted down the ‘People’s Peace Treaty.” Even the
treaty’s supporters said it was poorly written and “objectionable.” We
think Bucknell students should now make some statement of what they
do support in relation to South East Asia. To this end the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee to Stop the Treaty submits the following Peace Proposal.

1) There will be an immediate and unconditional cease-fire through-
out Indochina

2) All people held as prisoners of war by the North or South Viet-
namese, the Viet Cong, the Americans, or any other force operating in
South Vietnam will be released immediately and unconditionally.

3) All military forces not native to South Vietnam will withdraw from
South Vietnam on a published timetable of withdrawal.

4) An election will be held in South Vietnam with all political views
represented. All ballots will be secret to safeguard against future “re-
pression’’ of voters.

5) The cease-fire, the prisoner release, the withdrawal, and the
election will be guaranteed by the governments involved and will be en-
forced by international inspection.

We urge all students who consider themselves ‘“‘antiwar” and who
voted against the treaty to publicly support this proposal. We further urge
the ABS, as our official spokesman, to endorse this proposal.

Professor Rinkus describes the
“close cooperation of the educa-
tional system with the military.”
There are currently 11 students at
Bucknell on ROTC scholarships who
are directly thankful for the close
cooperation as are many others in
ROTC. For one reason, it has saved
them and their parents a total of
$27,927.50 thiis school year alone
and perhaps has provided them with
a unique opportunity to attend this
fine institution. We would ask Pro-
fessor Rinkus if he would prefer the
military to be led by un-educated
individuals, or by well-educated
young men such as those commis-
sioned from Bucknell.

We would suggest that if Profes-
sor Rinkus would have left the
“growing American community in
Saigon” (with its “bar maids, house
maids and prostitutes’) and served
for extended periods in the field
where the war is being fought, his
low opinion of what Americans are
doing in Vietnam might be com-
pletely different.

state that we are proud of our 1

formance itself; it is here that the
vision becomes dramatic and the
revelation is shared.

In each of these three transforma-
tions the Vision judges us and finds
us weak, our vision impaired, and
our community in fragments. The
audience at the premier perform-
ance either did not know the story
of the Passion or its members were
mostly Protestants who insisted on
interpreting the gospel for them-
selves; the sound of the turning of
pages in the program notes sug-
gested that for many the only vision
was of faintly visible print. In a
Myth-play, authority and judgement
come from the stage, and consider-
ing how little rehearsal time the
performers had with the complete
text, the authority of the perform-

ance was remarkable.

There are surely countless visions
of this work which in
open up the gap between dream
and realization: the author’s vision
of what they created and of what
they saw performed, the perform-
er’s of the effects they wished to
achieve and of what they were able
to achieve, the audience’s of what
they were being challenged to ex-
perience and of what they were
capable of experiencing. But such
an awareness of our mutual in-
adequacies is central to the poem.

In the Prologue, the Poet is con-
scious of the weight of his belly on
his soul, but he is nevertheless
aware that his “lewd letters’ cre-

Racketeers Rally over Raiders;
Engage Nittany Lions Tomorrow

By MARK KNODERER

The Bison netters overcame a
game Colgate team, 5-4, Saturday
afternoot at home to garner their
ninth straight victory of the season
and twenty-fourth straight over a
two year period. On Friday after-
noon the team had defeated the
Syracuse Orangemen, 8-1 at home.

Colgate coach Joe Abramson used
an extensive switch of his lineup to
pull off the near miss, a tactic
which was quickly dubbed the
“Abramson Stack’’ offense by the
Bisons.

The morals of tennis state that
you should always play your best
man at the number one position,
and so on, but this unwritten rule
is not always followed. Abramson
claimed injuries and personal prob-
lems forced the drastic changes,
but the story does not fit

For instance: Geoff Steadman
played sixth singles and first
doubles. Steve Schindler, normally
the third singles player, played
first singles and third doubles. Jack
Neems played at the second singles
position, but did not play doubles
Dick Kadesch, the second singles
player, was taking medical exams
during the singles, but returned to
play second doubles

Fortunately the upper half of
the Bison ladder refused to be sha-
ken by the shenanigans. Steve
3aird, Alex Anderson, and Jim
Lackritz all won in singles, and

Baird and Anderson won at first |

doubles

The bottom half of the ladder
floundered a bit, but made a re-
spectable showing with the crucial

his own record in the javelin with a
toss of 11”. The mile relay
team ran @ 23.3 for its best time

match by winning the third set,
6-3. T gave the Bisons a 4-2 lead,
which was much more acceptable
than a 3-3 deadlock.

Against Syracuse, only the sore
shoulder of Bob Christianson pre-
vented the Bisons from a shut out.
Christianson was the fifth singles
player until the injury sidelined
him two weeks ago.

His teammates, however, had
little trouble in polishing off the
Orangemen, as only the third
doubles went into three sets.

The team felt that one of the con-
tributing factors to the victory over
Colgate was the large crowd which
watched the match. Coach Rey-
nolds refuses to make predictions
as to the outcome of tomorrow’s
Penn State match, but both he and
the team would appreciate a large

4 LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

One advantage which history affords is the
ortunity for reviewing, concluding and, conse-
ently, projecting. Bucknell University has had

25 years of history, and its past is, indeed, a
means of distinguishing the roots of contemporary
trends and the direction of University growth in
the future. In this commemorative 125th an-
niversary magazine supplement onsored by The
Rucknellian, some of 3ucknell’s past, present and
prospects are described

Any kind of publication or writing, for
that matter demands selection when content
is decided upon and, in a magazine vhich initially
attempts an overview of the years 1846-1971,
selection obviously becomes a crucial factor. One
can only hope that enough “flavor” of the years
will filter through the words and pictures that
were eventually chosen for this issue.

Contributing writers like seniors Robert Wen-
del, Don Thompson, Dan Miller and Eric Riess,
junior Nicki Drew, sophomores June Heistand and
Nancy Grden and freshman Dean Landew make
the selection process work in this magazine because
each, in penning a particular aspect of Bucknell
University’s evolution, develops an essay in-
dividually characterizing various things like the
school’s growth, personalities, issues or (what
seem now as) trivialities.

The photographs too, submitted by Riess and
Bob Arnold, capture amusing or pertinent ‘spots
of time” in Bucknell’s past and present.

or less, beginning to demonstrate a
liberal trend, and it was this trend which
sparked serious inquiries on campus re
garding students rights, concerns and free-

important student questions were
being asked in the 1960's, A perusal of the
editorial page of the newspaper in 1960

LEWISBURG:
Expanding Town

By NICKI DREW

The activity of Lewisburg revolved, in
846, around its waterways

The Susquehanna River was not adequate
for the town’s growing commerce and, In
1833, the citizens were therefore granted
a cross-cut canal which was responsible (by
the time the University was founded) for
much of Lewisburg’s commerce, industry
and recreation

Indeed, much of Lewisburg’s indu
pended on water. The resulting sh
ing business, flour mill, woolen
saw mill relied on the streams and the
naturally, for power

As the mills grew, so did the town and
vith that growth came other, s busi
nesses. Donehower’s Store (1877) and
Gundy’s Hat Shop are two obvious ex
amples. Others, including a nail factory
brick yard and chair factory (which has
since become a general furniture outlet
also helped make Lewisburg a center for
industry in this area

CULTURAL APPETITE

Besides the small-industrial growth
isburg’s cultural appetite was satisfied
its own Opera House which resided in
area behind (what is now) the post

According to a longtime Lewisburg
Robert Donehower, the House

from twelve to fifteen hundred
patrons, it featured such personages as
Henrietta Crozman, DeWolf Hopper and
Eva Tanguay (do they ring a bell and
sho a i Mistress Nell, “High
Henry’s rels’’ and the Follies. When it
was destroyed by a fire over fifty years

2 replaced — perhaps one

say that Lewisburg’s cultural life
went up in smoke

Other ‘‘institutions’ were dominant in
Lewisburg’s past, too. The Railroad was
an important part of the town — and a
significant means of transportation for
many students attending the steadily-ex
panding University

THE ORANGE AND BLUE

; In 1887, in¢ reasingly aware that most col-
leges were identifying themselves with colors,
the students of Bucknell voted that orange and
blue become the colors of their University. Ten
years after, the first issue of a weekly newspaper
was published, named the Orange and Blue —
student vote later changed it to The Bucknellian.

ALUMNI RELATIONS

; Through one of its alumni, Bucknell has left
its mark on the state of Alaska. Charles E. Bun-
nell, who received Bachelor’s, Master’s and Honor-
ary degrees from Bucknell, was the founder and
first president of the University of Alaska; until
his retirement in 1949, he was considered the fore-
most educator in the territory.

Around the world: Bucknell University has
become known in Argentina via a contribution to
international education. In 1963, the University
signed a contract with the Agency for Interna-
tional Development of the State Department.
Under the direction of Dean Herbert Eckberg
th > College of Engineering assisted the University
of Cordoba, Argentina, to improve its undergrad-
uate engineering program.

By STEVE KNIGHT

What authority and _ responsi-
bilities should a department chair-
man have? Several University de-
partment chairmen discussed their
views on the subject in an inter-
view with the Bucknellian.

Dr. Douglas Sturm, chairman of
the religion department, presented
the idea of modifying the role of
the department chairman last week
at the meeting of the American
Association of University Profes-
sors

Dr. Sturm emphasized the im-
portance of the department chair-
man as the only formal channel be-
tween University administration and
faculty.

He also pointed out the import-
ance of a chairman’s decisions on
such matters as salary level and
tenure for an individual faculty
member.

‘Cancelled’ Meeting

By JANET RUSSO

In keeping with the philosophy of
“no business as usual’’ on May 5,
Bob Nachshin, ABS President, de-
cided against holding a regular
Wednesday night meeting. He over-
ruled the steering committee’s vote
of 3 to 1 (Russ Pais absent) to con-
duct a meeting.

Chuck Resnick, ABS treasurer,
was going to run the meeting as of
Tuesday night. However, upon ex-
amining Article I of the Constitu-
tion early Wednesday morning, it
was realized that only the president
has been given the power “‘to call
and preside over meetings,” or the
vice president in his absence. At
noon Wednesday the secretaries
were instructed to notify all mem-
bers that there would be no meet-
ing that evening.

These proceedings were unknown
to the nine representatives who did
arrive for the meeting, and who
questioned the legality of such pro-
ceedings. They felt there was suf-
ficient reason to conduct a meeting
and discuss the agenda as it was
outlined. They, therefore conducted
the meeting.

Resnick’s motion concerning the
re-allocation of the student fee of
$30 was accepted and will be pre-
sented as a referendum next Thurs-
day. A revised proposal on the im-
plementation of the visitation policy
from the student affairs commit-
tee’s recommendations, was then
presented by Neil Hendershot, LUR
member, and was passed. The final
action was the appointment of one
sophomore student to the traffic
committee.

Upon consulting Nachshin later,
he declared that the meeting and
any decisions made were unconsti-

A i NBR IRE ERED AOS GN ASANO

tutional due to the fact that neither
he nor Pais had called the meeting
nor were present.

Added to the legal problem is the
fact that a quorum of the Congress
was not present. An inconsistency
is brought forth in this statement
however, because last week’s meet-
ing was considered official, despite
the fact that a quorum did not exist.
It is believed that proposals and
amendments will be made at next
week’s meeting, in order to clarify
existing policy

State

In place of the current setup, Dr.
Sturm believes there should be a
method by which faculty members
can review a chairman’s decisions
He also feels that some organiza
tion should be responsible for evalu-
ating the individual chairman

As a possible solution to the ‘‘pri-
vileged’’ position which department
chairmen now enjoy, Dr. Sturm
would be in favor of a faculty re-
viewing committee to judge the
performance of each chairman.

In contrast, Dr. David Ray, chair-
man of the mathematics depart-
ment, emphasizes that all of a
chairman’s decisions are under con-
stant review by both fellow faculty
members and the University
ministration

Dr. Ray cited the
most departments, chairmen are
elected by the other members of
their department, and can, there-
fore, be removed by a concenst
vote.

He also emphasized the general
procedure in which a chairman’s
decisions are subject to the ap-
proval of the dean of the respective
college and the provost as a limit-
ing factor upon the chairman’s au-
tonomy

Dr. Ray stated that he would not
be in favor of a faculty reviewing
committee to replace the current
setup.

Dr. Harry Garvin, chairman of
the English department, is also
aware of the many limitations upon
a chairman’s autonomy

Dr. Garvin notes that within his
own department, committees have
been formed to handle some of the
administrative matters which were
formerly reserved exclusively for
the chairman

At this time acceptance deposits
are still being received so that few
details or statistics (class ranks or
average SAT scores) are yet avail-
able.

Walling stated that he is hoping
for more than 725 acceptances be-
cause he expects what he terms
“considerable summer erosion.”

He noted that ‘‘all private schools
had fewer applications” than usual
this year (they were down almost
10 per cent here) and consequently
the University, like other private
institutions, ‘‘made proportionally
more offers’ than before.

Therefore, Walling expects there
will be ‘considerable movement”
during the summer months, as the

more prestigious schools accept ap-
plicants from their waiting lists, and
some students planning to attend
this University will move elsewhere.

The admissions committee is hop-
ing for approximately 450 to 475 ac-
ceptances from men and 250 to 275
from women to achieve the goal of
725 in September.

Walling noted, however, that
there ‘“‘shouldn’t be any decrease
in quality’ in the Class of 75. The
freshman class is expected to be
“similar in quality to last year’s
class’’ because it is smaller.

With regard to the present hous-
ing problem, he stated that the ad-
missions committee ‘‘defined the
freshman class’ for next year with
curriculum and housing in mind.
The committee is ‘‘sensitive to the
housing situation’ but does not ex-
pect as large a problem as pro-
duced by the present ‘abnormally
large’ Freshman class.

Also included were resolutions
providing for the rights of non-ten-

croachments on freedom, objection
to American involvement in Viet-

the poor state of the American
economy

Commenting on the AAUP’s in-
fluence, Dr. Peeler said, “It’s major
sanctioning power it the threat of
censure for violating academic free-
dom. In most cases this is enough
to cause the administration to
change ways.”

A main concern about the use of
the National Labor Relations Board
is that though they have jurisdic-
tion in colleges, their primary work
has been in industrial relations. Dif-
ferences between the academic
world and labor can arise.

“The faculty believes they have
the right to decide,’ Dr. Peeler
added in exemplifying a difficulty
that might arise between the fac-
ulty and the NLRB.

Also condemned were policies con-
cerning nepotism, hiring faculty and
staff members on the basis of
family relations. The resolution

Insurance Available
To Dorm Residents

An insurance policy covering per-
sonal property loss for students
living in residence halls is being of-
fered for next semester by the
National Student Services, Inc.

Losses of personal property over
$25.00 and up to $1500.00 due to
theft, fire, vandalism, and from
dam due to water, wind, smoke,
or explosion are covered in the pro-
gram.

Personal items such as articles of
clothing electronic equipment
furniture, musical instruments, and
hebby equipment are covered by
the program; items such as checks
currency, tickets for commercial
transportation, autos, bikes, contact
lenses, artificial teeth, and other
items are not covered in the pro-
gram

The policy is unique in that it is
the only such program offered to
three million students. Because of
the high number of students, cover-
age can be offered for $7.70 each
year.

as to the motion’s comical nature. De-
spite a few important problems with its
implementation, it would be unfortunate
if the faculty dealt with the motion as
if it were some sort of a joke.

The real worth of the motion lies
in its outline of “the working rationale

The motion itself calls for an evalua-

specifies no time for the evaluation and
in what manner it is to be made. This
must be specified.

We cannot agree with the proposed
one year requirement, which appears to
be a contradiction of the definition of

that the requirement is necessary

FEEDBACK: Counselor

To the Editor

In the past few issues of The
Bucknellian, various articles ap-
peared which criticize the selection
process of Junior Counselors and
the JC’s role in the freshmen dorm-
itory. The undersigned Junior Coun-
selors of Trax Hall do acknowledge
the presence of certain problems re-
garding the realm of the counselor.
We do, however, believe that some
previous attacks on the JC deter-
mination, orientation, and role
cognizance have been based largely
on personal feelings

The criticisms often discredit,
misinterpret, and misrepresent the
merits of the administrative selec-
tion policy and the orientation and
role behavior of the counselor. Until
the presentation of Don Thompson’s
article, “JC’s Uncertain about Their
Role’ Trax Hall counselors’ senti-
ment was indifferent. No reply was
deemed necessary. The emotional
undertones and biases were blatant.

But now we feel compelled and
warranted to denounce an article
written out of ignorance, be it
partial or total. . .

The assertion that there is a
“glaring lack of communication be-

tween the counselors and the resi-
dent directors” is inapplicable to
Trax Hall. The JCs have developed
a rapport with the freshmen. They
have established a similar relation-
ship with Resident Director Steve
Turner.

The keenest source of communica-
tion has been through his hall
counselors. We feel our individual
conferences with Steve or the week-
ly meetings attended by Steve and
all the counselors have satisfied the

and solved the problems
which arose, in spite of Mr.
Thompson’s belief that counselors’
meetings are “either unproductive
or non-existent.’”

On several occasions we have in-
vited members of the administra-
tion and student government to at-
tend our meetings and clarify
policies or advise us on specific
problems.

One particularly vital asset that
we have in this dorm is the com-
munication between and among
counselors. An incapable or unin-
terested Head Resident could dis-
rupt such communication as well
as cause numerous other problems.

Jazz Responsibility
To the Editor:

In view of the overwhelming turn-
out at the West Chester State Jazz
Band-Inner Tube concert on Sunday,
May 2, | feel compelled to publicly
express my gratitude to the con-
scientious ‘news editors’ of The
Bucknellian for their beyond-the-call
-of-duty advertising of the event.
You people have done your (very
little) bit for Culture by desperately
avoiding any type of thorough dis-
semination of the news and have
vastly contributed to the awareness
of Bucknell students and the litter
of junk mail and posters on campus,
not to mention the morale of the
kids who give their time and talents
to make things happen around
here.

POOLILEDIIDDDL DODD LE LILILDODIDOI OOD I LS,

major link in this communication as
well as relating our concerns
through administrative channels.
He has, at times, been the coun-
selor’s counselor.

If our hall is not functioning pro-
perly, we follow our own beliefs
and perceptions in order to regulate
the problem. We do not brandish
rules wildly nor blindly. It is fool-
ish to profess that we feel we “are
supposed to be policemen.” The
freshmen in our halls know we are
not authoritarian figures, even
though we posses the potential to
exercise authority

The administration have greatly
expanded JC roles over the last
two years. There is now substantial
flexibility. Rules have been sub-
stituted by reason. Peaceful co-
existence, academic excellence, and
an expanding maturity are the
goals.

Even though the most important

aspect of being a good counselor is
to be oneself, we feel that the
counselor orientation has at times
proved invaluable. We do not
always learn what to do in certain
instances, but mostly what to ex-
pect, ..
Counselor orientation has already
begun this spring and will resume
2 days before the new freshmen ar-
rive. It has entailed reading books
on counseling advice and drug use
and a basic acquaintance with the
University branches, offiicials, and
their functions.

Throughout the year we have dis-
cussed and proposed revisions and
additions to the entire counseling
program.

Th feollowing new additionally
stressed topics were submitted:

1. explicit knowledge of the Uni-

versity judicial system and
punishment specifications
. more interaction of new coun-
selors with past junior coun-
selors
. better understanding of Coun-
seling Services
a. more emergency and ab-
normal counseling training
from Dr. Wilder, clinical
psychologist of the Counsel-
ing Service
4. more drug training

S Reply.

. closer working and understand-
ing of the SIS (Student Infor-
mation Service; drugs, birth
control and abortion, hotline)

6. increased awareness of extra-
curricular activities

7. acquaintance with Student Gov-
ernment representatives and
procedures

Some of the suggestions already
have been incorporated into the
training program. Others are still
under consideration, but we feel
they will be approved. . .

Don Thompson observed that
there is “non-communication and a
lack of confidence between student
personnel and residence hall ad-
ministrators.’’ This is valid to a
certain extent, only if he is refer-
ring to the channels between resi-
dent hall counselors and Freshmen
Residence Hall officials and of
University administrators

Some of the problem will be al-
leviated by more contact and learn-
ing from past JCs. Improved
counselor orientation will also aid.
But there must be increased inter-
action feedback, and confidence
directly between the counselors and
the particular administrative of-
fice: .

The administration should revise
the counselor selection process.
There should be more emphasis on
peer evaluations, not just from
present University counselors. Rec-
ommendations from professors are
a possible source. But the interview
schedule should be greatly expand-
ed. Present freshmen evaluations of
their counselor can be a valid in-
dication of effectiveness and should
be retained as a judgement cri-
terion for reapplying counselors. . .

Hopefully the readers will realize
that this letter was written not only
in rebuttal, but also out of concern
and desire for improvement. Our
involvement provides an excellent
vantage point from where we clear-
ly see the shortcomings of the JC
system. However, we are dismayed
at the rash judgements and dearth
of constructive suggestions from
others.

Sincerely,
The Junior Counselors
of Trax Hall

they can continue to support the

FACULTY STUD

University Discrimination

By JEAN WILLIAMS and SUSAN LOUGHLIN

Last April and May, the Women’s Equity Action League and the
National Organiation for Women filed complaints of sexual discrimination
in hiring against 150 colleges and universities. Subsequent investigations
forced more than 2,000 schools to open their personnel records to inspec-
tion by Federal agents. If Bucknell were investigated, would sexual dis-
crimination in faculty employment be revealed?

First, note the percentage of faculty members who are women: 13.5%.
And the number of female chair‘men’ of academic departments: 1 - the
head of the women’s phys. ed. department. In what rank are most women
faculty members? Of the three lower ranks, (Assistants, Lecturers, and

Instructors), 16 of 49, or 3:

are women. However, there is consider-

able thinning out of the women’s ranks when the three higher posts (Pro-

fessor, Asso
of 198, or 6.6%,
higher positions

iate Professor, and Assistant Professor) are considered: 13
are female. Why? Aren’t women capable of filling these

The lack of motivational models for the girl has become a matter of
concern to educators, some of whom have strongly urged that the uni-
versity give more thought to providing models for undergrad women by
employing more women faculty members in prestige positions to demon-
strate that such fields are open to qualified women. The absence of
women in faculty posts and positions of authority cannot help but affect
negatively the students’ general attitudes toward women’s capabilities, as
well as the women students’ achievement motivation and future occupa-

tional goals.

Why aren’t more women hired here? The conditions of work are not
ideal: lack of other women faculty with whom to associate, lack of day-
care facilities for women faculty with children, unstated policy on ma-
ternity leave, relegation of women to secondary positions, lack of active
recruitment of women, unwritten and ambigious policies prohibiting sim-
ultaneous employment of husband and wife, and wage discrimination.

Women faculty are paid considerably less than males for the same
work. For example, the median salary for male and female professors

combined is $16,639

However, the median salary for women professors

alone is only $14,780. Associate professors? Median of all: $12,974; median

of women, $11,325, and so on. . .

How are such consistent wage discrepancies explained? That’s the
key to the problem. They are not explained at all. There is no policy re-
garding hiring of women, or recognizing the needs of women faculty as a
legitimate minority group at Bucknell. It is doubly hard to combat pre-
judicial attitudes that are not brought out in the open and given body

and definite policy.

It is imperative that official recognition be given the needs of women
as a minority group within the university, and that policies be formulated
and implemented that are directed toward rectifying present inequities
and disadvanteges experienced by women in hiring practices, wages, and
decisions of promotion and tenure. Refusal to recognize the existence of
discriminatory practices should not be tolerated by educated persons.

Infirmary Ignores Girls’ Needs,
Refuses to Provide Gynecologist

We all know that when we com-
pare Bucknell with state schools or
when we compare the University
today with the Bucknell of yester-
day, women have it comparatively
better, and we should all be grate-
ful, (we are told). University pub-
lications exude great airs of belief
in equality and individuality, but
somehow the general attitude to-
ward women implied by the prac-
tices of the University seems to put
this in question. How does Bucknell
see the Bucknell woman?

Ah, yes, things have changed -
women are allowed to live off
campus, make their own meal ar-
rangements, and set their own cur-
fews. The trend is in our favor, I
admit, but Bucknell hardly treats
women as capable of making de-
cisions in their own best interests.
Why are women still locked in their
halls at night when men are not?
(Sure, we know, mad rapists would
ravage the Bucknell beauties . . .)
Why must women under twenty-one
bring a signed slip to prove that
their parents approve of their living
off campus, when this is not re-
quired of male students? (The land-
lord usually requires this signature
to make a lease legally binding,
but why the University?) Why do
freshmen women have hours when
freshmen men do not? There are,
of course, reasons for these decis-
ions which sound fairly ‘‘reason-
able” and some of them even make
sense

The questions here are raised to
question the actual intent of these
regulations. More serious questions
which need to be asked, however,
lie in the failure of the University

Women in Academe -- AAUP Considers Situation

By MARYANN BRANDT

(Condensed from “The Second
Sex in Academe”’ by Ann Suther-
land Harris in the AAUP Bulletin,
Sept., 1970. Research into the prob-
lem of discrimination against wo-
men in higher education is handi-
capped at present by the scarcity
of studies of individual colleges and
universities. This article is based
on up-to-date statistics available
from the University of Chicago.)

ks by men famous
in the > world reveal all
too clearly how women are re-
garded in Academe. When former
Jent Nathan Pusey of Har-
i realized that the draft was
going to reduce the number of men
applyi to Harvard’s graduate
reaction w She shall
be left with the blind, the lame, and
the women.’’ Sometimes there ap-
pears in serious publications what
appears to be a reasonable objec-
tion to giving women the same op-
portunities as men, that is, that
women are enrolling in graduate
schools without having seriously
considered the obligation they are
assuming by requesting that such
expenditures be made for them.
That women who go to graduate
school do make a serious commit-
ment is proved by studies that have
taken into account the degree of
education of working women. The
amount of education a woman has
received is a more important factor
with respect to her decision to work
than either marriage or children.
For example, Helen Astin found
that of 2000 women doctorates sur-
veyed ten years after completion of
their Ph.D.’s, 91% were working,
81% of them full time.

Responses to a questionnaire pub-
lished by the AAUW (American As-
sociation of University Women) in
its January 1970 Journal showed
that the majority of over 3,000 men
who replied believed ‘“‘that women’s
first responsibility is to be the
feminine companion of men and a
mother, that women have less need
to achieve in the working world,
that they have adequate opportunity
to develop their potential, that the
job turnover rate and sick-leave
rate of women is higher than that
of men, and that women have dif-
ficulty dealing with males in sub-
ordinate positions. It should be quite
obvious, however, that those women
who wish to become professors,
lawyers, and doctors can hardly
have less need to achieve in the
working world than men, for they
will need far more determination

than men to reach the same status
and enjoy the same opportunities.
The sick-leave rate and turn-over
rates for women are, according to
latest figures from the Women’s

Bureau of the Department of Labor,
slightly lower than those of men.

The way men treat women in em-
ployment situations and in higher
education is a simple one: the high-
er the job or education level, the
fewer women are tolerated.

Overt discrimination against wo-
men in graduate school is exempli-
fied by the following quotations,
gathered from various institutions
last year.

We expect women who come here
to be competent, good students, but
we don’t expect them to be brilliant
or original.

Women are intrinsically inferior.

Any woman who has got this far
has to be a kook. There are al-
ready too many women in this De-
partment.

(To a young widow who had a
five-year-old child and who needed
a fellowship to continue at grad-
uate school) You’re very attractive.
You'll get married again. We have
to give fellowships to people who
really need them.

Laws for Women

“Women who feel oppression, women involved in the fight
for women’s liberation, are not paranoid. Their feelings of
oppression are not imaginary. Indeed, their oppression, in
more areas than generally realized, is built into the law.”

You say you're getting married this summer? You say you and
your guy have it all worked out, the marriage will be democratic—
he won’t be authoritarian, you won’t be submissive? You might h:
it worked out between yourselves, but have you considered the laws
pertaining to you in your status as a married (and liberated) wo-
man? Following are just a few of the laws you may have to deal

with.
In Ohio, Pennsylvania,

You must assume his name.

In North Carolina the first $2000 of your husband’s income will
be exempt from tax, but you are only entitled to a $1000 exemption.

In Alabama, Florida, Indiana, No. Carolina or Texas you cannot
dispose of property without your husband’s consent

In Maryland you are limited in your ability to sue or be sued in

your own name.

In California, Nevada, Florida, Penna., and Texas you must
have court approval before setting up a separate business. In
Florida the wife is required to declare to the court her ‘character,
habits, education and mental capacity for business’ and briefly
set out the reasons why such disabilities should not stand in the
way of her acquiring a business!

In only four states (Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, and New
Hampshire) are you allowed to establish your own domicile for all
purposes, without limitation. And in only 22 states are you allowed
to establish your own domicile if you and your husband have agreed
to live apart. (Domicile decides where you vote, where you are
eligible for public office, where you pay property and income taxes,

etc.)

If you live in Ariz., Calif., Idaho, La., Nev., N. Mex., or Wash.
(all “community-property” states) you will be pleased to discover
that all property or earnings are owned jointly by the husband and

clusive right to control and manage the estate.

The principle behind all this is an old feudal doctrine called the
law of coverture which says in effect, that by marriage the hus-
band and wife are one person in law. Justice Black in 1966 pre-
sented the situation even more clearly: ‘‘Though the husband and
wife are one, the one is the husband.”

Jackson State. “¢

Head reference librarian of Bert-
rand Library and one of the wit-
nesses to the Harrisburg Six con-
spiracy trial, Mrs. Zoia Horn spoke
about the atrocities being commit-
ted to hundreds of children in South-
east Asia.

She appealed to everyone present
not to forget them simply because
of the great distance between us;
“they are our children, even though
they are on the other side of the
earth.”

Also lamenting the “countless
number who have suffered the
American way of death,” Gene
Chenoweth, chairman of the polit-
ical science department, attacked
the bureaucratic structures within
America which expand fear and

teach hate.

“Those who died at Kent and
Jackson State have, let’s face it,
died in vain.” Chenoweth’s appeal
was to the members of college
campuses to search within them-
selves for the answers.

Representing the Association of
Blacks for Progress, David Young
began his address by wondering
whether there would have been a
nation-wide strike if the murders at
Jackson State had occurred alone.

The difference between the white
and the black has been, according
to Young, the fact that while the
white student is disturbed about
certain failures in our government
and our society, he is incapable of
feeling the anger of the black stu-
dent. ‘“‘What is happening does not
hit the white man in the gut.”

Protestors Confront
ROTC Ceremony

Guests arriving at the annual RO-
TC awards ceremony Thursday
afternoon were met outside Davis
Gym by approximately twenty per-
sons demonstrating against the Viet-
nam war and the presence of ROTC
on campus.

Many of the demonstrators car-
ried water pistols and held broom-
stick “rifles.’’ Before assembling at
the gym, the protestors had taken
a short mock “march” around the
campus.

Senior Paul Osher brandished a
gorilla mask and shouted at each
arriving guest, “See yourself in the
magic mirror! Kill! Kill!”

Most of the persons entering the
gym ignored the demonstrators.
One University administrator told
Osher, “We have nothing to talk
about.”

Tempers flared later, when the
ceremony ended and people began
to leave the gym.

Osher became involved in a shout-
ing argument with several of the
departing guests Insults were
traded and Osher was asked to
leave by Dean of Student Affairs,
John Dunlop.

Osher, however, refused to leave
until all of the persons inside the

A Musical Perspective on ‘Vision of Christ’

By PETER EGGERS

When considering what should be
said about the musical aspects of
“Vision of Christ,” it came to me
that the most intelligent approach
would be to first consult the com-
poser to answer a few questions
that were raised in my mind about
the work. Consequently, the first
part of the article is devoted to
some observations by Dr. Thomas
Beversdorf prompted by my ques-
tions, while the second portion in-
cludes some of my own remarks
upon the work and the performance
we were presented with last Satur-
day evening.

The music in the “Vision” is
based on a famous tone-row of
Anton Webern’s but Dr. Beversdorf
did not strictly adhere to the serial
technique. He remarked that very
soon after Arnold Schoenberg de-
veloped the twelve-tone system and
others began experimenting with
it, it was found that the longer a
strictly twelve-tone piece is ex-
tended, the less successful it be-
comes. In order to write a long
work such as the ‘‘Vision,” a com-
poser must depart from strict ad-
herence to the system; departing
from the rigid system adds much
more variety to the work. Even
Schoenberg himself realized the ne-
cessity of braking away from the
strict rules in hiis most successful
works.

Advantages

When asked what the advantages
are of utilizing a serial system in
composition, Dr. Beversdorf said
that a serial system is structurally
as beneficial as tonality in ordering
a piece. In music which no longer
relies on functional chordal relation-
ships, one needs some other kind of
ordering mechanism to give shape
to it: the serial system thus func-
tions as an organizing agency in
place of the overused one of func-
tional tonality. He also mentioned in
passing that he has found that in
writing dodecaphonically the sys-
tem itself sets up additional mo-
tives: in constantly manipulating
the row he finds that the new mo-
tives will crop up several times and
this seemes inherent in the system
itself. This is an extra advantage
to the composer

An interesting part of the ‘‘Vis-
ion” is its use of both medieval and
modern musical materials. Dr
Beversdorf made several state-
ments relating to this facet of the
composition
of Music Forms
medieval period is
generally simple while today’s
music is extraordinarily complex
and is becoming even more so at a
tremendously st rate. But the
music of today has evolved out of
the music of the past and there-
fore, contemporary music reflects
a depth of tradition; it is indeed
related to medieval music. To quote
Yr. Beversdorf’s remarks in the
program notes: “Yet what seems
t radical may indeed be a re-

ering of materials and a recrea-

n of techniques that have deep

sts in tradition.’’ There are great

ons in our music today but
re was also tension in medieval
sic. Thus, by the “Vision” in-
ding both kinds of music, the
work is showing the relation of a

simple time and art balanced with
a more complex one. Quotes from
medieval material also occur to
lend the work a certain archaic
quality and flavor. The juxtaposition
of medieval and contemporary ele-
ments in the music is paralleled by
the concurrence of these elements
in the text.
Instruments

The instrumentation and intuitive
combination of instruments is a di-
rect attempt to communicate the
essence of the sound and mood of
medieval music. Percussion is much
used in ‘Vision’ as it also was in
medieval music. The use of a wo-
oden piccalo and flute coupled with
the recorders is similar to the
sound of a medieval recorder con-
sort. The use of brass is related to
the medieval use of sackbuts, while
the doble reeds (oboe, English horn,
bassoon) are related to the medie-
val chaum. The double bass is a
direct descendant of the bass of the
medieval period. Dr. Beversdorf
mentioned that the other stringed
instruments of the middle ages had
less tension than our stringed in-
struments do today; thuse he chose
to use the violas in “Vision” be-
cause they have a softer, duller
sound than both the violin and the
cello. The use of the harp and harp-
sichord, and the use of pizzacato
playing is related to the sound of
medieval lute music. The instru-
ments are played in various combi-
nations to effect an archaic quality
and to correspond to the custom of
playing instruments in consorts (or
families) that was common in the
medieval period

Dr. Beversdorf also noted the use
of motives which recur throughout
the piece that are related to cer-
tain turns of phrases or ideas in
the text. Other structurally unify-
ing devices besides the text, mo-
tives, and the use of twelve-tone
technique are the various tradi-
tional compositional forms used
sectionally

When asked what other com-
posers’ influences could possibly be
found in “Vision,” Dr. Beversdorf
replied that Mahler was an in-
fluence both vocally and orchestral-
ly. When asked if his prominent use
of percussion was at all related to
Varese’s he said that it wasn’t re-
lated directly anyway. He said his
concept of percussion comes largely
from his early association with Car-
los Chavez, and from the way in
which percussion is largely used to-
day.

Personal Observations

Now follow my remarks as a
spectator.

The performance on the whole left
a lot to be desired, to put it lightly.
Much of the piece was just played
through without any interpretative
playing, and a great deal of it was
performed so inexactly that much

400 Market Street

of living

of the music itself was almost un-
intelligible. The performance of
Part II, (even forgetting about the
costly miscueing that inaugurated
about ten minutes of embarrassing
chaos), was so uninspiring and in-
exact as to have made this section
impossible to understand and al-
most worthless as a concluding sec-
tion. The whole production could
have been better coordinated and
have had much more of a flow to
it. The high points of the perform-
ance, however, were the vocal solo-
ists; all of them did fine jobs,
especially the basses.

If one could get past the diffi-
culties the poor performance pre-
sented, there are a number of other
aspects about the piece that de-
serve comment.

Orchestration and Vocalization

In the area of orchestration, the
sounds emitted by the instrumental
ensemble were quite amazing. The
percussion section is quite domin-
ant and contributes much to both
the texture and the movement of
the piece. Instruments are com-
bined in very interesting ways
which create sounds that this listner
has never heard before. The effect
achieved by combining an oboe and
a piccolo with the soprano on the
word ‘‘swooned” is particularly
stunning. The use of the harpsichord
and the harp, and the varied color-
ings of the piece

The vocal writing is very effective
also. The close relationship to the
text integrates the words and
music to an extremely close degree.

the choral representation of the
“mad mess of people” shouting for
Christ’s death by yelling ‘‘Nail him
up, nail him up!”’ There are many

other instances in the score of ef- |

fective tone painting of the text.

ance we heard, which was pretty
well messed up by this time, but
I have a strong feeling that it might
be more than that. The momentum
of the piece is so deflated by this
section that the conclusion of the
piece which follows seems almost
without any impact whatsoever.

(A problem might also exist in
the work being presented in such
a large gymnasium. As John Wheat-
croft mentions in his program notes,
the work should be a “passionate
spectacle” for the audience. This
seems to imply to me a communal
identification of the audience with
the action and an emphasis on ri-
tual. In such a large hall, it is
easy for an audience to become de
tached from the action. A presenta-
tion in a much smaller theater
would probably enhance the atmos-
phere and involve more people in
the work.)

Strong Points

In general, though, beneath the
muddled performance I detected a
very powerful musical-drama. It is
a subtly well-written piece of music
that combined with the text and the
staging conveys a strong sense of
the power of the medieval imagina-
tion. Through the work we are
brought firmly back into medieval
times and back into the realm of

with the power that seemed to lurk

then a much more valid critical

A report on Lewisburg has been
recently completed by John Ander-
son, Associate Professor of Eco-
nomics at this University. The re-
port is the result of several surveys
conducted by students here under
Anderson’s supervision in the spring
of 1970.

inadequate.
Changes

However, this does not mean that
the people in Lewisburg desire 00
changes at all in the community.
Fifty-eight percent of the people
surveyed would like a shopping cen-
ter here, and y percent favor-
ed more off-s parking. The
downtown shopping area, thus, ap-
pears to be in need of some basic
cha 's according to some people,

A majority of businessmen felt
that the population of the Lewis-
burg area would double iin the
next ten years. Predicting that
their employment needs would in-
crease about 10% in the next 5
years, they estimated that 60% of
that new labor force would have
to be recuited from outside the
Lewisburg area

A large part of the study also
concerned housing in Lewisburg. It
indicated that Lewisburg housing
prices have soared in the last de-
cade. In 1960, the averege price of
homes sold in the Lewisburg area
was $8,309 as compared to a 1970

of $16,778

Substandard Housing

When the study arrived at the
subject of substandard housing, it
was found that only 44 out of nearly
2,300 homes qualified as ‘“‘sub-
standard,”’; however, there seemed
to be little evidence of overcrowd-
ing and all of the units had elec-
tricity and town water.

This evidence is, thus far, very
encouraging

When one looks at the occupations
of those living in the substandard
housing, however, a major problem
develops. It was discovered that
25% of those people that lived in
substandard housing were students
attending this University.

The fact that the majority of the
living units were in the North Ward
of the Borough, could cause even
more concern. Property values in
this section of town could decline
considerably in the near future, not
to mention its “livability.”

Furthermore, a random sample of
students showed that 27% of the
males and nearly the same propor-
tion of the females desired to live
off campus. This would mean that

900 students would consider
searching for an apartment or home
in the Lewisburg area. Will the
students be able to afford the ris-
ing price of an apartment along
with a rise in tuition?

The majority of people polled
favored a growth of industry in the
Lewisburg community; however,
there was a huge discrepancy in
the response according to the length
of time the responder lived in
Lewisburg. It was calculated from
the data that 2 out of 3 people that
have lived for less than five years
favored industry, while 2 out of 3
that lived here for more than 15

years opposed any industry.

It appears that the older resident
will have to fight to keep the area
as they want it, while the newer
resident will have to struggle to
keep industry growing.

The Future

The problems presented in this
study are the normal problems of
any town such as Lewisburg. The
serenity cannot last forever without
some planning for the future. The
main theme of this study has been
“Have we given sufficient thought
to our future?”

One question can be asked of all
members of the community, and
that is ‘‘What can the local resi-
dents do to insure that the area
growth is in keeping with their
vishes?”’

Wha will people do when they
realize that the high cost of owning
their own home in Lewisburg will
force them to live in low cost
multiple dwellings or modular hous-
ing? What will people do when they
find that they are living in a com-

munity quite different from the one
they wanted?

What shall be our plan of action?
The report, in its conclusion, called
for an “open debate-with a frank
airing of divergent opinions” to
Lewisburg into the community ‘‘we
all want.” Pooling our total re
sources and ideas was cited as the
best means to come up with work-
able ideas on obtaining the future
“we all want.’

Awareness Needed

When asked about his written con-
clusions, Anderson stated, “I want
to get people interested in the prob-
lem of their future. . .they must be
come aware of the problems that
will resllt.”

“T will also hope that Bucknell
students will become more con-
cerned about our area’s future,’’
Anderson added. Copies of the re-
port are available from the Eco-
nomics Department and Professor
Anderson is most willing to talk te
anyone interested in this subject.

Editor Discusses
Tristram Policies

By DEAN LANDEW

“If anybody is interested in writ-
ing, Tristram is surely a good place
to start,” says senior Andy Kraft,
editor-in-chief of Tristram, the Uni-
versity’s creative arts magazine.

The magazine, which is published
twice a year, is comprised of con-
tributions of poetry, prose (short
stories, essays, and interviews),
music, art and photographs from all
segments of the University com-
munity.

The latest issue of Tristram,
which Kraft expects will go on sale

| sometime this week, will contain
two stories, four poems, six or
seven photos, two songs, an inter-
view, and an essay on literature in

the 1920’s.

Kraft says that there are really
no space limitations as to what is
published in Tristram. ‘‘We’d rather
go to cheaper methods of publica-

| tion,’ he comments, ‘‘to get all the
| good things in.’’

He mentions that “everybody’s
contributions are looked at equal-
ly,’ and that none of the editors
ever judges his own work. Kraft
does say the people interested in

| writing usually “turn up as in-

volved with the magazine,” and
that many of those people are the
largest contributors.

What is ultimately published,
Kraft states, involves basically a

| staff decision, although the final
| decision belongs to the editor-in-
| chief. Kraft says that a faculty
adviser, Assistant Professor of
English Dennis Baumwoll, only
| serves “‘to deal with the adminis-
tration.”

Kraft does maintain two com-
plaints about reaction to Tristram.
“I sort of deplore the lack of in-
terest on campus in the magazine
for its creative output and input,”

‘We know we can help you, even
if it’s just to talk to someone.

he says, “and I sort of wish the
Bucknell community would take the
magazine more seriously, and sub-
mit things of high quality.’ Kraft
feels that many of the contributors
whose works are not published have
talent, but talent which needs
further development.

He also mentions that the money
appropriated by the ABS to Tris-
tram was cut over a third to $800.
“This is one activity with a great
potential for returns,” says Kraft,
“We felt the cuts were too much.”

He notes that two new ideas for
Tristram will be explored by next
year’s editors. One is the possibility
of a single, larger annual issue. The
other is a nationwide poetry/prose
contest with a $50 prize for the
best piece of prose and the best
piece of poetry

The latter proposal is intended to
increase sales by offering the maga-
zine on other campuses and to
generate more interest here on
campus. It would not be an at-
tempt, says Kraft, to make Tris-
tram inaccessible to students here;
University contributors would still
be given priority.

The new editors, selected Monday,
who will be considering these pos-
sibilities as well as working on the
magazine next year, are Jim Alley,
editor-in-chief; Robin  Bitterlich,
prose editor; Marianne Long, poetry
editor; Don Richman, art editor;
Peter Hecht and Doug Abdelnour.
photography editors; Bob Drake,
business manager; and Jim Reed
publicity director.

Concerning this semester's issue,
a $50 prize for the best work of
prose and the best work of poetry
will be given. The decision in both
categories will rest with Professor
Baumwoll, Associate Professor of
English; Karl Patten, and one other
member of the English department,
according to Kraft. The winners will
be announced next week.

The new issue of Tristram will be
on sale for 50c in the bookstore,
the library, the English department
office and the cafeterias during
dinner.

Banquet Honors Senior Athletes

Gene Luccarelli came away with
top honors Wednesday night at
Bucknell’s annual Senior All-Sports
Banquet. Luccarelli won two awards
while five other seniors were re-
cipients of one apiece.

Head Football Coach Fred Pren-
der presented Luccarelli with the
Christy Mathewson Award as “the
outstanding senior athlete,” and he
was also named co-winner of the
Albert E. Humphreys Award, given
to “the outstanding multiple sports
athlete.’ Luccarelli earned three
letters as a defensive halfback in
football and three as a centerfielder
on the baseball team.

He is captain of the 1971 diamond
nine and is currently hitting .356.
Gene holds the Bucknell all-time
mark for most pass interceptions
in a season (10) and a career (18)

During the 1970 season he set a
record for yards gained on inter-
ceptions (128). The 5-10, 180-pounder
received honorable mention All-
State on the gridiron, and was
named to the Little All-American
Academic second team.

The other co-recipient of the
Albert E. Humphreys Award, pre-
sented by Head Basketball Coach
Don Smith, was Chris Riley. A co-
captain of the 1970-71 basketball
team, Chris earned three letters as
a guard, and three letters as a
catcher in baseball.

He hit over .400 in both his sopho-
more and junior years. Riley was
selected as the 1971 NCAA Official
Baseball Guide coverboy.

Don Giacomelli, was selected to
receive the Bison Club Award, given
to the “‘athlete who best exemplifies
the ‘winning spirit’ of Bucknell Uni-
versity.” Giacomelli, co-captain of
the 1970 football team, earned
letters for three years as a de-
fensive and offensive halfback, and
as a quarterback.

“Jock” is remembered most for
taking over at quarterback in the
second half of the 1969 Lafayette
game with the Bisons trailing, 20-0,
and leading the team to a 21-20
victory. He
mention All-State last fall.

The E. W. Pangburn Award for
‘sportsmanship, fellowship and con-
tribution to the Bucknell University

received honorable |

athletic program’’ was presented to
swimming co-captain Mike Huff-
man. Huffman demonstrated his
tremendous leadership ability at
the 1971 Middle Atlantic Conference
championship which the Bisons won.

He captured the 1,650-yard free-
style event and set a Bucknell
record in the process. Mike also
was a member of the victorious
800-yard freestyle relay quartet.
This spring he went out for track
for the first time and is participat-
ing in the pole vault.

Recipients of the E.C.A.C. Medal-
lion, given to “the student at each
member school who has achieved
an outstanding record in the class-
room and in athletics’’ were Dave
Hill and Kent Kisenbauer.

Hill has been a regular first base-
man on the diamond for the past
two seasons, and last summer was
named to the All-American Baseball
Academic first team.

Kisenbauer is co-captain of the
lacrosse team and was an All-MAC
second team defenseman in 1970.

The Bucknellian, presented its
fourth annual ‘‘Coach of the Year”
award to swimming mentor Richard
Russell. Russell guided the mermen
to the MAC title and a 9-2 record
overall. He has a three-year coach-
ing record at Bucknell of 26-10.

Forty-four seniors who had par-
ticipated in a varsity sport for three
years were presented with school
rings by the coaching staff as gifts
from the Bison Club.

The first annual Stuart M. Smith
Award was received by soph foot-
ball star Dick Diez.

Given in honor of the late Stuart
Smith, the award goes to “‘that
sophomore who _ best

ship and ability necessary for out-
standing football performance.”
Smith played at Bucknell from

1934 to 1936 and was co-captain of |

the gridiron team in 1936. He made

history in 1935 when he scored the
first two touchdowns against Miami
in the first Orange Bowl which was
won by the Bisons, 26-0.

Diez had an outstanding sopho-
more year for the Bisons during
the 1970 season. The 6-2, 195-pound
fullback gained 639 yards in 156
carries for a 4.1 average, the most
rushing yards ever gained by a
Bucknell sophomore.

tion on sex and birth control, which
might put the problem in its true
perspective, is half-hearted. (But
then whoever said that an ostrich
stance is conductive to a realis-
tic perspective).

Each year over 5% of Bucknell
women are faced with an unwanted
pregnancy - we can no longer deny
that there is a problem here that
the University is ignoring. We can
no longed deny that there is a need
that the University is refusing to
meet - excuses will not hold up any
more (The excuse of the problem
being “in committee’ is perhaps
the most evasive “‘action’’). The
University is proclaimiing its in-
difference to the needs of its women
students - yes, “‘even at Bucknell”
(especially at Bucknell?) there is
discrimination against women. Our
sisters in the movement have de-
monstrated against dehumanizing
treatment of women in so far os
they are considered sexual objects.
It is not even more dehumanizing
for a woman to have denied the
rights to any sexual being at all?

Women in Academe

(Continued from Page 3)
peatedly asked, “Are you really
serious?”’. In fact, women attrition
rates at University of Chicago are
only slightly higher than attrition
rates for men in biological sciences,
physical sciences, and social sci-
ences, and are actually lower than
male attrition rates in the humani-
ties. The slightly higher attrition
rate of women graduate students
can be largely explained by lack of
encouragement and the actual dis-
couragement experienced by women
graduate students for career plans,
as well as by discrimination in
financial aid

It is generally assumed that it is
more difficult for a women than for
a man to get into college (witness
Bucknell itself) and analysis of pub-
lished admissions figures provides
additional evidence in support of
the assumption that you have to be
better to get a place in graduate
school if you are a woman than if
you are a man. Women who have
definite career plans and conse-
quently choose to go on to graduate

school are, therefore, a very special
group of women. Only the very best
ot the good women students go to
graduate school. Out of these, only
the hardiest survive.

The lack of social approval for
women’s careers and the discrimi-
nation against women in higher
education insure that many able
and capable women will stop their
professional training with a B.A.,
which will, as is well known, en-
title them to become the secretary
of the male college graduate who
has just collected his B.A.

The Bisons upped their record to
6-11 as they routed their hosts
Juniata 7-3 last Monday in the rain.
However, more bad weather pre-
vented yesterday’s clash with Sus-
quehanna from being played.

At Juniata, sophomore Dick
Baines hurled the Herd to a victory,
with relief help from Jim Bolog-
nese, The BU bats supported him
in fine style with 12 hits, including
five for extra bases.

Mike Marinchak, who has been
in a slump, paced the offense with
three hits, and Steve Eck added two
triples.

Gene Luccarelli, playing at first
base because of a bad leg, added
a single and a two-base hit. John
Rudolph and Chris Riley also con-
tributed doubles to the attack.

The Bisons have been much im-
proved defensively this season, and
played well in the field against
Juniata. The Indians, in contrast,
were guilty of seven miscues be-
hind pitcher Lou Eckerl.

this week giving them an overall
record of 10-4. The golfers downed
Gettysburg and Lehigh by identical
4-3 scores last Tuesday at a tri-
meet on the Bullets’ home course.

The day before, the Herd hosted
the University of Rochester and
took a 395-404 victory in medal play.
The linksmen’s total of 10 victories
is the second highest total in the
team’s history

Junior captain Mark Reddy con-
tinued his fantastic play of the en-
tire season by firing the low score
of the day, a 74. Coach Brad Tufts
had nothing but praise for his num-

Frosh Defeat Kutztown

Stickmen by 8-4 Score

By JIM NORTHRIDGE

The Baby Bison stickmen showed
promise of things to come as they
downed Kutztown 8-4 in an away
game last Monday.

Monroe Diefendorf and Richard
Lotze provided the bulk of the
scoring as each rammed in three
goals and had one assist

Several of the freshmen are play-
ing for Jameison on the varsity and
are picking up valuable experience
Jamieson praised the freshman
midfielders Henry Ford, Charles
McPhail, Rich Murray, and Diefen-
dorf.

He also expects to use Jim Na-
vran and Rich Lotze on attack and
Jon Spain on defense this Saturday
when the varsity travels to Dela-

ship to the younger members of
the team.”

Reddy provided one of the high-
lights of the match against Gettys-
burg as he made a 30-foot putt on
the 18th hole for par’ which enabled
him to beat one up his Bullet op-
ponent. It was only the second loss
in 15 matches for the Gettysburg
golfer.

The other highlight of the Get-
tysburg match was Dave Maier.
The number three position sopho-
more shot a 76 and was a big
double winner as he made a six-foot
putt for a birdie on the first extra
hole to beat his man

Other top scores of the day for
the Bisons were registered by Dan
Stetz and Keith Anderson with 77’s
while George Ferantelli was also a
double winner from his number
seven pc on thus clinching both
victories against Lehigh and Gettys-
burg

Against the University of Ro-
chester Dave Maier had the best
score of the match for the Bisons
with a 76 while Stetz and Reddy
each fired a 79. However, Coach
Brad Tufts took best total for the
day with a 73

This Monday the linksmen travel
to Rider to participate in the MAC
Championships. Westchester and
Delaware are the favorites to win
the tournament but since the winner
is the total low five scores the
Bisons could very well have a
chance

Kirkland Proposal Tabled
Faculty Reviews Phys Ed Requirement

By JOHN DEBENEDICTIS

“I have absolutely nothing to say
about it.” This was the guarded
reaction John Kirkland, associate
professor of history, had to Mon-
day’s faculty meeting at which he
presented a proposal for an ex-
perimental investigation of the phy-
sical education program.

Briefly summarized, the motion
proposed: 1) a tentative rationale
for the existence of the physical
education requirement ‘presented
in general terms to suggest a di-
rection in rethinking and restruc-
turing of the P.E. department,” 2)
a plan for the Provost to appoint a
committee of specialists, including
students and faculty, to make hypo-
theses concerning the “nature of
play” which would be subject to
evaluation and, 3) a request for “a
one-year P.E. requirement in order
to meet the conditions necessary
for an experimental design’ through
which the hypotheses might be
tested

The motion was attacked by both
those in favor of the immediate
abolishment of the only University-
wide requirement and those who
wished the requirement to remain
in its present form.

Committee Requests Gynecologist

By JANET RUSSO
* At the final meeting of the year
last night, the ABS strongly recom-
mended that President Watts call a
special faculty meeting on or be-
fore May 24.

The prupose would be to permit
further discussion of a motion to
eliminate the physical education re-
quirement by Michael Payne, as-
sistant professor of English. The
faculty has been considering re-
ports from the CAR (Committee on
Academic Regulations) and also a
study presented by Dr. John Kirk-
land, professor of history, but to
date no changes have been made
in the present system.

A committee report concerning
the gynecological services in the
«University Dispensary was  pre-
sented by Jeff Sengstack. Based on
interviews with Dr. J. Weightmen,
director of the University Medical
Service, and other area doctors, the
report revealed that there is a
definite need for gynecological ser-
vices at the dispensary.

Presently, most women visit area
doctors for medical services, due
to the fact that the physicians at
the dispensary rarely perscribe
birth control devices to unmarried
women, have limited facilities for
performing examinations, and lack
the time to perform these duties.

The committee proposes that the
University, with the assistance of
the local gynecologists, find a third
gynecologist for Lewisburg. The
proper equipment should be ac-
quired for their use, to provide
reasonable service for the 1200
women on campus

Other services,
availability of the morning-aiter
pill, and birth control devices,
should also be offered.

An alternate proposal included in
the report, would be to have the
present staff set aside an extra
hour a day for gynecological ser-
vices to cope with the problem. The
report was unanimously passed
after being reviewed.

Neil Hendershot’s motion concern-
ing the determination of visitation
hours within the dorm was proposed
and approved after discussion. The
suggestions made were in the in-
terest of minority rights, and served
to further define the voting pro-
cedure on dorm policy.

A reply was received from the
Provost concerning the Report on
the Counseling Service. He recom-
mended that a more thorough study
be conducted and that alternative
systems should be introduced before
any further actions will be con-
sidered.

such as_ the

there was ‘‘subject matter worthy
of study in the field of ‘physical
education’, neither the minority
(in favor of the existing require-
ment) nor the majority (those op-
posed) reports presented an ‘‘ade-
quate rationale’ for a decision on
the matter.

The rationale presented by the
CAR was formed by a committee on
which there was a member of the
Women’s Athletic Department as
well as Robert Latour, Director of
Athletics

Latour supported the views of the

P.E. department with the advice of
psychologists, sociologists, and phy-
siologists that there is a need for
spending spare time wisely and that
some of this time is best spent in
participation in athletics.

The department felt that athletic
skills were a necessary prerequisite
to a healthy social, psychological,
and physical future

Latour also said that the depart-
ment felt they were doing a
thorough job at present and that no
experimental investigation was nec

By caterorizing the paragraphs

what they've done since they left

approximately how many males and
females had received their Masters
degree, how many males, single
women and married women were
holding jobs, and how many females
had gotten married. These two
classes were chosen because the
material was readily available from
the Alumni Office and presumably

Some of the difficulties we ran into
are that the entire class (497 in ’65,
508 in ’66) did not write about their
experiences, only in 65 and 199
in ’66 did so. Therefore, for all the
rest we knew only their names and
addresses and could not tell if the
men were married. Also, we cannot
definitely assume all females listed
as single are not married because
they haven’t kept in contact with
the Alumni Office. Finally, there

The Right to Know

By DEAN LANDEW

As more and more about ourselves is being made public, oftentimes
against our wills, drug use has remained one area which is essentially
private in nature. This is possibly due to the moral and legal issues in-
volved. But at any rate, definitive answers as to who is taking what drug
for what reason are nowhere.

One might begin to think that it is not answers we should search for,
but rather, that we need good questions to begin with. So The Bucknellian
asks: is drug use public business?

Our question arises from a major series on drug use here on campus
we had planned early this semester. The whole project deteriorated when
we realized that it was not going to be so easy to get the cooperation of
the student body at-large.

The focal point of this series was a poll on drug abuse. We knew from
the start that we would never be able to prove exactly how much truth the
results of such a poll would carry. Like everyone else who attempts to
survey a population, the best we could hope for was a reasonable indicator
of what was going on.

The methods of the poll could be argued vigorously, and some of
those who returned the questionnaire did so. Let it simply be said that 10
per cent of the entire student body was selected from a random table of
numbers and was sent a very brief explanation of the poll and a simple
questionnaire to fill out and return. (Too simple, commented some.)
Anonymity was assured, and to this day we have no record of who sent
what back.

We received about 130 out of 300 questionnaires sent out. With the ones
we received came many comments on the method ond nature of the poll,
mostly adverse. After not too much speculation on the partial results
(based on less than 5 per cent of the school), we decided to scrap the
poll, and with it, the whole project. There were too many reasons why
people would or would not return the questionnaire, and we had no way
of knowing what kind of sample we ended up with.

Now we only wish to bring to light the nature of such a poll or

(Continued on Page 3)

presumably these non-grads fall
into our “Uncertain” category be-
cause if they had sent in their
write-ups, it would have appeared
for us to see.

Although hastily done, the value
of this study is that it is a good-
sized sample and does give statisti-
cal weight to what many people
previously suspected (or didn’t su-
pect). 45% of the female respond-
ents of ’65 but only 20% of ’66 have
since received at least a Masters
degree compared to 57% and 25%
of the men in those respective
years. Although the total number
of people receiving Masters is low-
er in ’66 than in 65, the male ratio
is higher than the female one both
absolutely and relatively.

The interesting thing we found
is that although none of the single
females or males with or without
their MA or MS could afford not to
hold a job, six married women in
65 and one in ’66 with their ad-
vanced degree could. For 1965 this
iis one-quarter of all married fe-
males with Masters—what a tre-
mendous waste of brain power.
However, we must keep in mind
that now is the prime child-bearing
time for these two classes, and per-
haps the women will re-enter the
job market when their children
enter school. Many of the women
explicitely stated that they left their
jobs to have their first child. Ques-
tions must now be raised: How long
will they be out of work? Will they
ever go back? Are they using their
education or merely watching child-
ren:

Of all married females in the
sample (with or without a Masters)

and 50% in ’65 and 66 re-
spectively do not hold any job
while none of the males and single
females fall into this same category.
What are these women doing? How
can society afford to support these
privileged women? Perhaps because
they save society (and their hus-
bands) money which could be spent
on babysitting, cooking, cleaning,
and household duties?

Disrupting Protes
To the Editor:

I think the actions of a number of
Bucknell officials and VIPs during
the peace demonstration on Thurs-
day were disgraceful. Two little old
ladies (including the wife of a past
Bucknell P’ dent) seemingly un-
able to control their tempers bat-
tered down a few signs held by the
demonstrators. The demonstrators
responded with verbal heckling; Uni-
versity top brass responded phy-
sically.

The Bucknell officials nearly suc-
ceeded in turning a peaceful pro-
test into a dangerous confrontation
Only restraint on the part of the
protesters concluded the demonstra-
tion on a non-violent note.

Peaceful protest is an important
right; men who oppose it in this
manner are dangerous and disrup-
tive. It is my feeling that if certain
University officials are not able to
condone peaceful dissent they
should be replaced by men who can.

Abusive Tactics
To the Editor:

It is hard to begin this letter
knowing full well that those to
whom it is directed will probably
be the most closed minded about
considering it. And yet, I feel that

it is something which desperately‘

needs to be considered. In our
society today the right to protest
is being utilized in many productive
and useful ways. It is good to make
it known that you as an individual
feel something needs to be changed.

Demonstrations also should carry
with them the responsibility of
those individuals involved to work
to change that which they do not
believe in. Protest can also be
used as a tool for breaking down

Mayday Lockup

By LOU BUCCERI

The D.C. Coliseum is old and run-down just as most of the black
ghetto that surrounds it. Inside there are seats for about 10,000
people surrounding a large oval arena. The ceiling is decorated with
fading red, white, and blue pennants and bunting and in the center
a huge cubical scoreboard and clock hangs proclaiming ‘Pepsi-Cola’
for all the world to see. The National Guard formed a line at the
mid-point of the oval dividing the prisoners from the tables set up
for finger printing and mug shots. They stood with their riot clubs
at ease. At the edge of the arena (in the ringside seats) more
guardsmen and D.C. police sat watching.

Down on the floor about 1200 of us sat, stood, slept, sang, ran,
chanted, laughed, talked and (some) made love. We had been in
this twhile hockey stadium since 4:00 p.m. Wednesday, May 5.
It was approaching 11:00 a.m. Thursday morning. During that time
we had each had two bologna sandwiches (except the vegitarians
who ate bread) and some water. Nine hundred of us had refused
booking because we had not been allowed to see a lawyer or make
phone calls. To pass the time we danced and wrote slogans on the
4-foot wall surrounding us (Nixon’s a Vegetable) and rapped with
the cops and the guard. The guardsmen were our friends, most had
joined to ape the army. Whenever their shifts changed we
chanted ‘‘Free the M.P.s’” and applauded. Most of the D.C. cops
were in a good mood as well; they were getting close to $100 a
day because of overtime riot duty. We were hungry, tired and cold
(the coliseum was unheated), but in good spirits.

At about 11:30 a.m. we were told that we were being moved
We discussed whether we should go along or passively resist. We
decided to refuse to leave without first seeing our lawyers. About
20 cops moved in and began dragging us out. One cop felt obliged
to drag men out by their long hair. Another tried to bend women’s
fingers back until they screamed. He thought that they would then
cooperate; the poor fool was wrong. They spent about an hour mov-
ing people (some walking, some being dragged) to the buses.
Watching the scene some of the guardsmen were in tears.

The buses took us to the center of Washington. We traveled
down an elevator to some underground cells. They put 121 of us
in a 25 man cell. Six cells for 750 people. The women came in
seperate buses and were physically forced to submit to finger-
printing, the men still refused. By 8:00 p.m. Thursday evening we
had 2 more bologna and 1 cheese sandwich, plus some food sent
in by the black community. We had been held for 28 hours and
had seen no lawyers and been unable to make phone calls.

The new cells had very poor ventilation, the temprature topped
100 degrees. Three men in my cell fainted; one almost slashed his
wrists

There was no room to walk, sleep or do anything but sit and

being dismissed. A half hour later another lawyer appeared and
told us the first lawyer was wrong and that we were going to be
held in contempt of court if we didn’t fingerprinting. We

in an intersection, forcing traffic to stop. Some motori
continue moving right through the demonstrators, leaving it to them not
to get run over. Other motorists, who are normally irritated sufficiently
by the heavy rush-hour traffic, would curse and shout at the obnoxious
long-hairs. The feeling of hatred prevailed at every intersection I saw.
After a minute (or even less), the police would come running after the
kids, nightsticks swinging, and often, tear gas being thrown. Underneath
the helments and masks, one could sense the hatred that was present.
The kids would scream a few obscenities and then disperse, a few staying
behind to be arrested. A little later, groups would get together again and
the same thing would occur. Eventually, most of the kids decided their
time had come and were peacefully brought to what they thought would
be a jail, but was in fact a football field. It was “cops ’n robbers,” for
bigger stakes than most had ever played it before.

I wasn’t able to block traffic that morning. Instead, I was only an
observer although my heart was supporting the protesters. This was the
first time that I was actually witnessing mass clubbings and tear gassing,
but I don’t think it was that which really discouraged me. What I found
most depressing, was the hatred which was created from the physical
confrontation. The motorists were representative of so many people who
I knew and liked, the naval officer merely one of them. For me to tell
them, ‘no, you’re not going to go to work today’ as they shouted obscenely
at me, was making too great a demand of me. Likewise, turning the cops
into pigs was something I was not able to participate in. And besides,
what were we doing to end the Vietnam War?

I left Washington that afternoon more uncertain than when I had ar-
rived. It upset me that the physical confrontation and the violence that
ensued was being done in the name of peace. But yet, it remains a truth
that civil disobedience is usually the most effective means of bringing
about change. I left Washington with great respect for the people who
attempted to stop the war-making government for a day, but yet I
wasn’t able to join them in their effort. It seemed that civil disobedience
requires enormous commitment to cause, a commitment which forces
you to overlook the anger which you are likely to incite. I found myself
unable to ignore these adverse effects.

this that true understanding can

Somehow the hatred and abusive
attitude of some of those’ students
at Davis Gym is in my mind just
as destructive to peace as hatred
and abuse in Vietnam. Because of
this, the protest lodged Thursday
was not productive, it was not
good. It served only as the pro-
testor’s own edification. My con-
dolences are extended to those who

FRISCH FIRED!

To members of the Bucknell com-
munity:

We, the members of the fourth
New Dorm hall group, would like
to inform the academic community
of certain matters pertaining to the
recent “resignation” of our R.
About a week ago, he was asked to
resign by Miss Judy at the request
of Miss Peck, the Head Resident of
New Dorm

According to Miss Pec). and Miss
Judy, our former R.A. had failed to
perform certain administrative
functions several times during the
year. While we realize this is true,
we feel the infractions were of such
a minor nature that the “forced”
resignation was unjustified. We feel
that Bill’s working relationship and
rapport with the men on the hall
outweigh such minor incidents as:
failing to post certain notices, lock-
ing up late several times during the
year, failing to evict a pet snake
from the dorm

‘Misconduct’ Charge

(Continued from Page 1)

In response to the charges, Osher
stated, ‘“‘They leave me non-plussed;
it just seems to be another case of
small men in big places.”

Although he refused to make any
specific comments on the incident
itself, he added, ‘The charges
against me are so flimsy that I can
only conjecture that the Administra-
tion is being pressured to demon-
strate their disciplinary capabilities.

“I mention this because, at the
time of the alleged incidents, at
least one member of the Board of
Trustees was present. Therefore,
Zeller and Dunlop would seem to
have yielded to these external
forces, focusing upon me as a con-
venient target.’

In answer to The Bucknellian
editorial of May 7th, which ques-
tioned the value of a mandatory

proved the program instrumental,
Kirkland said, ‘“‘Sometimes you

Latour tended to agree when he
said, following the meeting, “If we
don’t have a required program the
students that need this type of
activity will never appear . . . The
history of the instiitutions that have

In objection to the ‘‘guinea pig”
nature of the proposed requirement
and the inability of the CAR to
produce a rationale for the two-year

sistant professor of English, pro-
posed abolishment of the require-
ment although pending the forma-
tion of an adequate rationale by the
proposed committee. His motion
was ruled out of order since it
changed the substance of the motion
on the floor and was not further
discussed.

The discussion of the motion

Cocktail Theater Presents Plays by Pinter, Odets

By SANDRA MARTIN

Three more Cocktail Theater one-
acts were presented in the past two
weeks on the Coleman Hall stage.
Clifford Odets’ Waiting for Lefty,
directed by Les Moonves, is a some-
what dated play when one views it
on an obvious and superficial level;
it is a series of vignettes dealing
with the problems—corporate and
private—of Depression America.
But looking deeper into the message
of the text, one senses a relevance
to one of the biggest conflicts today
—the right of the individual versus
the “powers that be’’—be they
governmental, political, or tradi-
tional.

Performed in an environmental

setting on a three-quarter thrust
stage, the play made good use of
the audience as part of the total
scenic design, seating them in a
configuration resembling a union
hall and having them rise at the
beginning for the national anthem.
Part of the cast was planted
throughout the audience to add to
the immediacy of effect; and the
cast in these large scenes main-
tained a high energy level un-
matched by many other recent
shows. Especially notable in these
scenes were the performances of
Stan Weindorf and Mitch Kagan.

Reflections on Harrisburg

By ROBERT WENDEL

As the end of the year draws near, and many members of the
campus community will have little or no contact with the proced-
ings presently taking place in nearby Harrisburg, it seems very
appropriate to comment on the Grand Jury investigations, indict-

ments, and stratagems to date.

From the first, it seemed obvious to many of the “witnesses,”
and/or “defendants” that the government was on a “fishing ex-
pedition.’’ One of the most obvious reas ons for this accusation was
that the subpoenas which were issued by the government were of
the “John Doe” variety. In essense this meant that the prosecu-
tion could delve into just about any area it felt important. This also
led many leaders of the peace movement to charge that the govern-
ment was using the Grand Jury as a means of intimidating and
scaring the moderates from taking part in anti-war activities, for

fear of later prosecution.

The original indictment of the Berrigans, in the words of News-
week, was “rucshed out after FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover leaked
word of the investigation prematurely to a Senate subcommittee.”
Since that time the prosecution has been desperately trying to
gather incriminating evidence from the many witnesses. It has gone

so far as to offer transitional immunity in hopes of forcing people
like fellow student, William Gardiner, into testifying—but with little
or no success. In fact it has gone even further now, to the point
where it has brought charges of contempt against some of those
who have refused to accept that immunity.

Then last week, Newsweek again reported that, “the govern-
ment won a new indictment in the case, adding two new defendants,
discarding Father Philip's brother (Daniel), and making the fresh
accusation that the defendants tried to recruit sympathizers to
vandalize draftboard records in several Eastern cities. But at the
same time, the government redefined the conspiracy accusation—
both broadening and diluting it, so that rather than carrying a life
sentence, the maximum penalty on conviction would be (only) five

years in prison.”

Along with this new indictment two letters, which are alleged
to have been written by Philip Berrigan and Sister Elizabeth Mc-
Alister, were released for national circulation—an act which many
have called a blantantly prejudicial act
leave much to be desired in the way of proving that any con-
spiracy was in fact taking place. There is no question as to whether
or not the letters refer in general terms to the “‘kidnap—in our
terminology, make a citizens arrest of—someone like Henry Kis-
However, nowhere, in either letter, does anyone come right
is anything more than a fanciful mental

senger.’
out and say that the ‘plan
exercise.

One of the most disgruntling aspects of the investigation is
developed
prosecution. There have been many inconsistencies on the part of
the government—holding some people for contempt and not others;
citing some for civil and others for criminal contempt for the same
actions; stringing some of the witnesses along while terminating

the ‘“‘psy-war’ which has

the subpoenas of others.

I would ask everyone on this campus the following question—
Have you ever considered doing something illegal, maybe in a
moment of anger, or depression, which you actually never comm-

ed? Then consider the following—What if someone ‘turned you in’,

The letters themselves

between the defense and

d you were charged with conspiracy to commit that act? The
fact is that this is exactly what the government is trying to charge
the Harrisburg defendants of doing.

The inevitable question one must ask himself is whether or
not the constitution is any longer a valid document. Because if it is,
surely freedom of speech would cover the “overt act’ of consider-
ing an illegal act. Another thing is this—who judges the legality of
governmental actions? For instance, if the President of the U.S.
committed a crime, who would arrest him? More than likely no one.
Thus when you consider that Sister Elizabeth viewed the “‘kidnapp-
ing” as a citiizen arrest and stated that Kissenger would be un-
harmed and released in a week, one can at least perceive the

rationale for the plan.

Finally, it would seem that regardless of one’s personal political
affiliation, one should realize that a lot more than a simple criminal

trial is taking

place in Harrisburg. Rather, the very fiber of the

constitution is being jeopardized; and more so by the government
itself, than by the “criminals” it is trying to prosecute.

with his small vignettes. In both of
their episodes, Sally Gudbrandsen
and Mitch Kagan were hampered
by a lack of imaginative blocking,
as were Jim McShane and Chapin
Wright in their scenes together; the
characters in these episodes seemed
to be performing on one plane and
in a one-dimensional fashion in-

Directed by Nancy Henry, The
York Crucifixion was a modern
version of the oldest example of
black comedy on record. The ad-
aptation of the 15th century miracle
play was written by the director
herself and was a devastating look
at the gross inhumanity of man to-
wards the Son of Man. Staged in a
three-quarter thrust configuration,
the focal set piece was a multilevel
angular representation of Calvary
that was an aesthetically pleasing

i inatively conveyed the neces-
sary somber and terrifyingly ironic

immediancy of the atmosphere; the
audience was convincingly drawn

less a performance than an actual
event happening before their eyes

Appealing Individuals

The soldiers as a unit appeared
somewhat stiff and limited in their
movement; at times they seemed
unable to break away from their
basic blocking patterns into natural-
istic motion. Individually, however,
there were some bits of acting that
were quite appealing. George Hatza,
as the greenhorn member of the
crucifixion detail, was especially
endearing as the sole sympathizer
with the figure of Christ; he was
in stark contrast to the others.
coarse, vulgar, and hardened by
similar gory executions in the past
John Traficonte projected a real-
istic “Marlon Brando’’ interpreta-
tion, while Mare Powers and Jay
Deluca convincingly emphasized
cruelty and indifference, respect-
ively. Although his part was rela-
tively small, Jon Whitney was a
strong and believable Christ. Per-
haps more time was necessary to
have brought together effectively
these disparate personalities into a
smooth and connected whole.

The Collection, written by Harold
Pinter and directed by Joan Billig,
in no way departs from the Pinter
norm of merciless and constant
questioning, innuendoes, and un-
answered truths which eventually
leads to an unresolved conclusion
The play concerns the interrelation-
ship of two couples, a man and his
wife whom he accuses of infidelity,
and a pair of roommates—alluded
to as being homosexuals—one of
whom the husband suspects as his
wife’s lover. Caught in a web of
what might be lies and might be
truth, the characters find them-

selves enmeshed in a situation with |

no defined boundaries.

The company of actors worked
together well under Joan Billig’s
direction; however, in many cases

the adopted English accents, al- |

though logically necessary for the
British play, were either forced or
else forgotten in speeches of several
cast members. Trevor Lewis was a
convincing James and was at his

best in his comic scenes opposite |

Bill, as portrayed by Bob Colgan.
Colgan impressively created his
character in all dimensions—voice,
personality, and movement. Maggi

By NEIL HENDERSHOT
The recent hint of resignation
from the Student Affairs Committee
by Edward Cotter, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Geology, culminates the
growing student-faculty criticism of
this, potentially the most powerful
of University committees. The Stu-
dent Affairs Committee (S.A.C.)
appears to be floundering because
of an absence of purpose, a lack of
authority or authentic power, and
a profound lack of confidence—evi-
denced both in its own membership,
and in its constituency, the Uni-
versity community—in its effective-
ness to successfully deal with the
affairs and demands of the students
These basic problems must not be
overlooked in a University body so
involved wiith student concerns.
At present, the committee is made
up of seven students, three faculty
members, and four admi
This group is given, on paper, the
momentous charge of supervising
“student life’; “The jurisdiction of
the Student Affairs Committee in-
cludes those matters involving stu-
dents which do not fall within the
jurisdiction of other established
University committees. The com-
mittee may study such matters
and make recommendations) as
fall within this area of definition
and which are submitted to it by
the President of the University, the
Faculty, the ABS, administrative
officials concerned with student life
or by students at large.’’ The com-

governmental structure unknown.
The great initiative taken by the
students themselves, acting through
the ABS, has come to overshadow
the meager efforts of the S.A.C.
Even when the Committee does take
on a matter, it works slowly. Its
laborious deliberations are com-
plete, no doubt; yet many students
question if this is indeed an ad-
ministrative stalling technique. Al-
ready it has become apparent that
its reports only confirm what is
already known. Much of this inef-
ficiency is due to spotty attendance,
a lack of quorum. It holds up busi-
ness: the report on hours and visi-
tation policy, perhaps its most im-
portant report of the year, could
not be forwarded immediately be-
cause not enough students on the
Committee could be found to sign it.
It seems evident that the basic
concept of the Committee’s struc-
ture and responsibilities must be
realistically revised. It must find a
place in either the student, faculty,
or presidential power structure. If
it is a study committee, its reports
should be timely; if it is a review

instruction.

The twenty-one works of art which
were selected as a Kress Study Col-
lection for the University include
seven Florentine paintings, one
from Siena, two from Rome, two
from Ferrara, one from Milan, one
from Bergamo, five from Venice,
and one from France, in addition
to the piece of Tuscan sculpture.
Selected carefully to be used as an
effective teaching tool, it has been
possible through these works to
suggest the growth of painting
styles within important schools in
western Europe.

Tassi Landscape

“Landscape with Tobias and the
Angel’, attributed to Agostino Tassi
(1566-1644), is, in the opinion of
professor of art, James Turnure,
an excellent work and one of the
most outstanding of the Kress Col
lection. In a landscape tradition
usually associated with French and
Flemish painters, the style of Tas-
si’s work was brought to Rome
from Antwerp by his master, Paul
3ril (1554-1626), and taken from
Rome to France by his pupil,
‘laude Lorrain (1600-1682). Although

i’s technique which resembles
that of Bril earned him his reputa-
tion, he was also a good painter of
perspective and architecture, his
favorite subjects being marines and
wide landscapes.

Born in Perugia, Tassi neverthe-
less considered himself a Roman,
and in fact did much of his paint-
ing there, including work in the
Quirinale and the Rospiglioso and
Doria palaces. His reputation has
been enhanced much as a result of
his famed student Lorrain.

be dated around 1520, not far from
Sansovino’s chief work, the ‘‘Ma-
donna and Saint Anne’’ in Sant’
Agostino at Rome. Roberto Longhi
has said of this work that ‘‘it is a
characteristic example by Andrea
Sansovino, Tuscan sculptor, who
sought to translate into marble the
ideas of the Raphaelesque classic-
ism. In this case it seems clear
that the inspiration was derived
from some Raphaelesque ‘tondo’
(round painting).’’

Although Venturi feels that San-
sovino “‘here reveals himself in the
soft forms and in the sweetness of
the rhythm,” the work’s attribution
has been questioned by Ulrich Mid-
deldorf, Director Emeritus of the
Kunsthistorisches Institut in Flor-
ence, who visited the Kress Gallery
with the express purpose of ex-
amining this sculpture

Echoes of Leonardo

Giampietrino’s ‘‘Cleopatra’’ (pic-
tured) suggests, according to Gum-
mo, ‘‘the importance of the Leo
nardesque tradition in Milan.’ The
general character of this painting
is definitely reminiscent of Leo-
nardo Da Vinci. Seated beside a
table over which a striped cloth is
thrown, Cleopatra stretches her
right hand over a_ basket, from
which an asp has already come out
and wound itself around her arm

work in the Kress Collection, in-
cluded for its illustration of Italian
influence on the North. When in
the Cook Collection, in fact, this
painting was attributed to Annibale
Carracci, which can be explained in
part by the generic resemblance to
the ‘‘Polifmo” by Annibale on the
ceiling of the Palazzo Farnese in
Rome and by the presence of other
elements of Bolognese culture.

In the painting, the giant Poly-
phemus, nude, is seated on a rock,
holding pipes in both hands and
turning toward Galatea, who stands
on her sea-shell surrounded by
nymphs and tritons and cupids. To
the left Europa and the Bull are
surrounded by trirons, while a
Nereid swims in the foreground

Although the works of art thus
far discussed represent more im-
portant pieces of the collection,
several other paintings should not
be overlooked. ‘Madonna and Child
with Saints and Angels’’ by Spinel-
lo Aretino (1346-1410) is one of
these, in addition to Angolo Bron-
zino’s “Portrait of a Lady’’ and
“Portrait of a Young Man in
Black,” attributed to Tintoretto. The
attributtion of “‘Madonna and Chil

“Polyphemus and the Sea Nymphs,” by the French artist Francois
Perrier, shows a definite resemblance to the paintings of Annibale Car-

in fact, been previously attributed to Annibale.

‘Morgan’ and ‘Great White Hope’
Are Among Area Weekend Films

By DAN MARTIN

Morgan! (1966), Hilltop’s feature
Friday night at 8:00 p.m. in Vaug-
han Literature Auditorium, is an
offbeat black comedy from Eng-
jand, which tells how an unmanag-
able, eccentric young painter
David Warner) is destroyed by his
love for his mother, Karl Marx,
King Kong, and his ex-wife Leonie
Vanessa Redgrave).

The young rebel’s principal pre-
occupation is to win back his
estranged spouse before she mar-
ries his ‘“‘intensely bourgeois’ art
jealer, a project which he carries
jut in a charmingly destructive
manner by laying seige to her
house, planting small bombs under
her bed, and wiring a sound system
to startle her and her lover in their
tender moments. Going a_ bit
further, Morgan steals Leonie’s car,
nearly blows her mother to smither-
ee and finally has the girl kid-
napped. After doing penance in jail
he turns up again at her dressy
wedding reception in a monkey suit
of real fur, beating his chest and
uttering wild animal cries

Reacting to this obviously wild
fantasy, critic Richard Schickler of
Life praises the performances of
the two st but ultimately brands
the film as fashionable, for-
gettable, and hardly worth the ef-
fort to praise or blame.” Morgan’,
in his opinion, offers us the atti-
tudes of revolt, but without ever
posing a genuine threat to our con-
ventional comforts of wisdom. “We
tolerate this non-hero in his mo-
ments of rebellion,’ say Schickel,
“as we might tolerate a 2-year-old
in his. The issues are obviously
serious enough to him, but since he

is neither smart enough nor strong
enough to coerce us into action, it
is easier to ignore him.

Granting a certain’ amount of
visual humor and pleasant farcical
turns to the film, Schickel nonethe-

less reveals his deeper distaste for
the work, when he writes: ‘I’m
getting heartily sick of these films
and fictional heroes who exist only
to illustrate the fact that life is
capable of driving anybody crazy.”

Lewisburg’s Campus Theatre of-
fers, through Saturday, The Great
White Hope, followed by Cromwell
for the first part of next week. The
former, a modern tragedy _pat-
terned after the life of heavyweight
fighter Jack Johnson, begins with
the white supremacists at the turn
of this century who can’t bear the
thought of a black champion and
consequently enlist the services of
a white boxer who they hope will
defeat him. When he fails to do the
job, they resort to the machinery
of the law—a procedure simplified
by Johnson’s preference for white
girls,

Although rising to fame, high-

od by a triumphant journey to
ance, by the time Johnson faces
> Kid in a fight that he has agre-
ed to throw, we know his pride, his
abstinacy, and his bitterness; but
we are also aware of his longing to
return to this country however it
has mistreated him—to his family,
and to his race

The Great White Hope, based on
the enormously successful play, is
impregnated with the timely tint of
racism and depicts, according to
Saturday Review’s Arthur Knight,
the ultimate humiliation of Johnson
(changed to Jefferson in the play
and film)—not merely the relent-
less governmental persecution, but
the grinding erosion of his own self-
esteem

Demonstrating considerable vir-
tue in preserving James Earl Jone’s
powerful Broadway performance as
Jack Jefferson and Jane Alexan-
der’s scarcely less remarkable per
formance as his white mistress,

critics Knight and Richard Schickel
nevertheless agree that the film is
a disappointment in that the camera
brings attention to the fact that
playwright Sackler never bothered
to create truly alive and human
characters to surround his central
figures.

As Schikel states it, “The drive,
the tension, the ferocity generated
by the play as it tried to escape the
prison of the stage is missing and
the piece seems to stumble and paw
the air, look for all the world
like an ill-trained fighter running
out of steam with five rounds still
to go.”

Cromwell, if we are to believe the
critics (and we usually pay atten-
tion to the intelligent on has
almost no saving qualities. “A dry
spectacle,” according to the New
Yorker’s Pauline Kael, ‘‘written
and directed by Ken Hughes with
dedicated stodginess,’’ Cromwell is
a thoroughly unbelievable movie.
As Miss Kael observes, “England
seems a large country to have had
only one just man, and surely Crom-
well must have been more than this
sullen prig who hates power, or he

ldn’t have obtained it. One

meticulously authentic in its phy
sical production, and handsomely

the failure of this film by observing
that ‘ kespeare spoiled us for

Tristram: A Review

By DEAN LANDEW

Aside from being pretentious and arty, the cover of this se-
mester’s Tristram is nevertheless intriguing. As the gateway to
the rest of the magazine, one wonders what the cropped and
darkened reproduction of David’s ‘‘The Death of Marat” portends.

The original painting depicts a martyred hero next to a block
of wood which David has turned into a tombstonelike symbol. I
would hate to think what this might foreshadow in the coming
pages. But the painting is also an historical account. Maybe this
best reflects what Tristram is this time around

In reviewing last semester's magazine, Jim Alley seemed to

Stickmen Lose Twice

By JEFF QUINZER

Despite a consistently strong team
offense, the Bison lacrosse team
dropped its second consecutive
game, a 16-12 loss at Penn State on
Tuesday.

The tape of the game will be
televised this Sunday at 4 p.m. It
was taped by WPSX television,
Penn State’s educational television
station. It is part of the “Sports
770’s’’ series and will be seen in
the Lewisburg area on Channel 44.

The defeat to Penn State followed
a 17-6 loss to Delaware in another
away game on Saturday. That loss
eliminated the Bisons from a pos-
sible tie for the MAC crown.

Coach Sidney Jamieson analyzed
the team’s last two games.

“We haven’t been nearly as ag-
gressive we're capable of play-
ing,” the coach said. ‘“‘We haven't
been getting the loose balls often
enough and they ultimately con-
tribute to the offensive power a
team is able to generate

“The team’s defensive play has
been deteriorating,’ he continued.
“The problem doesn’t lie with any
one individual, but with the team
in general. Also, we've been weak
on face-offs.”

The offense has been doing a good
job and scores a high percentage of
the time it has possession. But the
team’s inability to come up with
loose balls and face-offs severely
limits the amount of time the of-
fense controls the game, with the
result being that the pressure falls
on the defense a good portion of
the game to halt the opponents at-
te

The team will try to improve on
these points in the final game of
the season, a home game Saturday
against league-leading Lebanon
Valley. The Bisons are still an im-
portant factor in the MAC race and
could upset the standings with a
win here

Fifth mn MAC's

meet with their best five golfers
totaling a 788. They were followed
by Lehigh (796), American (801),
Delaware (802), and Bucknell (806).

Steady shooting marked the links-
men’s play as sophomore Dan Stetz
finished sixth in 156 and was fol-
lowed by John Maier-158, Greg
Mordas-161, Mark Reddy-164, Geor-
ge Ferrantelli- Mike Sinkus-170,
and Ray Douglass-171.

With everybody returning next
year the Bison golfers have to im-
prove on their excellent 10-4 recond
and move up in the MAC standings.

TO THE SENIORS:

Best of luck in your new futures!

“I’m expecting a good game,”
commented Coach Jamieson.
“They’re an extremely aggressive
team. I don’t believe they have
the same basic skills and natural
talent we have, but they make up
for it in desire and aggressiveness.

“They’re pressuring
you, trying to take the ball away
from you,” he continued. ‘‘We’re
going to have to play more physical-
ly and aggressively.”

Win or lose, this marks the last
game for senior co-captain Lou Kis-
sling. The attackman was named to
the third team Little All-American
last season and recently broke the
Bison four-year scoring record. He
is presently leading the Bison attack
in total points and has been nomin-
ated for the North-South Senior All-
Star Lacrosse game.

“This game pits the best college
lacrosse players in the nation
against each other,’ explained
Jamieson. “This is a lacrosse play-
er’s dream; just to be nominated
is an honor. I know for a fact that
he’s being highly considered

Continued Jamieson, ‘‘Lou is big,
strong; he can run, is a fine sho-
oter and a good feeder. This year
he hasn’t scored as many goals as
in the past but he has gotten a lot
of assists. And they count just as
much as goals.”
