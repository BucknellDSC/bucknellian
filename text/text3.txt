The last meeting of the Mechanical
Engineering club students was one
of the best in the history of the or-
ganization. Professor Burpee had
charge of the meeting, and the at-
tendance of the Electrical Engineers’
Society swelled the attendance, Tho
organizations were addressed by Mr.
N. G. Reinicker, who is, at present,
the superintendent of operations of
the Pennsylvania Power and Light
Company at Allentown. He spoke of
power stations in general and then
touched upon and explained ‘Super-
power" systems and stations, Ile
spoke more in detail! of the steam
boiler operation end of the game and
explained the details of the 2500 h.
p. boiler located in the Detroit Kdi-
eon Company's plant in Detroit with
whom he was employed during their
construction, These are the largest
and most powerful of their kind in
the world. ‘

clear of the fleld, Smith batted down
a pass that looked as if it would
surely have resulted in a touchdown.
Seybolt intercepted a forward but was
downed on his five yard ine. When
he attempted to kick out of danger
the pass went wild and by the time
he had recovered the ball. Hahn
fackled him behind the Hne for a
safety. The bali was brought out
to the twenty yard line, and on the
very first play, Seybolt nailed a for-
ward and got away for twenty more,
An aerial—Bellak to Drory—was
good for ten niore. But the Frosh at-
tempted to use the alr line once too
often, and the next was intercepted
by Dayhoff. The Sophs came right
back with the same stuff, and Gdan-
iec to Wrenn netted twenty yards.
After another attempted forward the
game ended with the ball on the

This trip is part of the yearly pro-
gram of the Musical Clubs, which en-
deavor to bring Bucknell University
before the cyes of the public. Football
and other sports do this in large mea-
sure, but not completely, for there
is a considerable percentage of the
public which does not rate a college
acocrding to its sports but in propor-
tion with its musical and Hterary
ability. Both sports and music are in-
dispensible in this effort of advertis-
ling Bucknell, but they must work
‘hand {n hand to secure the best im-
\prdeation. With one absent, the public
[get an idea of a school poorly-bal-
anced.

In addition to advertising Bucknell
in this manner, the members of the
club will be on the outlook for good
matertal for future Freshman classes
for the university. This ts one of the
‘best works of the Musica! Clubs for
Rucknell when on trips.

The repertoire of the club has been
increased by several new songs thi:
year, and these will be used in giving
the club as a whole more appearance
on the platform. Requests that the
entire elnb apepar more often dur-
ing the course of the program, than
has been the custom have meen made
from nearly every town in which con-
certs have been given.

The solo work on the trip will be
taken care of by Ralph Hartz,
“Boby" Hartz. Don Cloward,a nd
Hobart Brown. All of these men are
sufficiently well known to dispel any
doubt as to their ability. And last,
but very far frum wk be
Keech, the eartoonfst with the frre-
pressible smile and “line.”
