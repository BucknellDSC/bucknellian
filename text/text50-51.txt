Enrollment Tops 2000 Again;
Includes Over 500 Freshman

t)

More than 600 students, which in-
clude 550 freshmen and 50 advanced
standing transfers, arrived last Sat-
urday to begin a five-day orientation
progrm for the 1950-51 school term.

Twenty more freshmen hit the cam-
pus last Thureday night for a special
two-day introduction to the Univers
ity at the Freshman Camp at Cowan.

Over 2,000 Studenis

According to latest estimates, ern
rollment this fall again exceeded 2,000
students although final figures are
not available. Classes for all stu-
dents began yesterday when the Uni-
versity was opened formally for her
106th year.

Although the number of upperclass
men who have been drafted or calied
for duty from the reservos cannot be
definitely determined at this time, it
is believed that the Korean situation

did not greatly affect enrollment this | 2°"

semester.

Frosh, Yes: Bucknellians, Maybe

Although “Freshman Orientation Week” is officially closed,
we feel that the orientation of 570 yearlings to their new home
can’t be accomplished in a matter of days, Therefore, we don’t
think it’s too late to welcome the Class of 1954 and add a hope
that college will mean the beginning of a higher education.

It may seem strange to have full run of a deserted campus
for a week, and then find upper-classmen moving in as if they had
a long-term lease on the place. To those Frosh who seem slight-
ed, all we can say is the time-worn phrase: Bucknellians aren't
made overnight.

Being registered as a student in the University doesn’t auto-
matically make one a Bucknellian. There have been students
who've gone four years without realizing that they are a part of
the school And those are the students who still feel slighted
when graduation day rolls around

There isn’t any formula to follow in becoming a Bucknellian.
It merely takes a little time, a little effort, a little patience, and a
lot of interest.

Probably the first test will come tonight at the Pep Rally
Those who go with a sincere desire to learn the cheers and songs
and make some noise will have a head start on the Frosh who sits
in the m and watches the parade go by

If a word to the wise is sufficient, then we've said enough.
No one is going to lead you down the path to becoming a Buck-
nellian, nor is anyone going to hand you a book of instructions.
Just join in the spirit, forget your days of glory as a senior in
High School, let the upper-classmen do the talking for a few
weeks, and you'll be a Bucknellian before you can say, “BEAT

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1950.

It took just 80 hours for a 17-year-old “brain” to wrap up four
years of college this year at the University of Chicago! Joseph Ed-
ward Nelson passed a battery of 14 placement tests which shows he
lea has the equivalent of a college education. So Nelson by-
passed undergraduate work at the University to do graduate study in
mathematics. Wonder if he had to take World Lit!

Students in a chemistry class were bombarding the professor
with questions on the nature of matter and space, reports The Hurri-
cane. The questions were flying fast, and the mentor got a little
flustered. Trying to put his point across, he raised a quieting hand
and explained: “Space is matter with nothing in it." What's the
matter? :

The late George Lyman Kittredge, famed Shakespearean scholar
atHarvard, inspired many anecdotes which have already made him
a legendary figure in the lore of colleges. Lecturing one day while
pacing about the-platform in his usual manner, he stepped off the
edge of the platform and fell to the classroom floor. He picked him-
self up, dusted himself off and climbed back up on the platform to the
tune of a tittering class, He faced his students and said with dignity,
“Gentlemen, I believe this is the first time | have ever descended to
the level of my audience.” Guess we don’t have them all!

When Cyrus Northrup was president of the University of Min-
nesota in the early years of this century, he once participated in a
ceremony to dedicate a new cemetery. The day was cold and raw.
When Northrup's turn to speak came, he put his hat back on his head,
suggesting that the others do the same. “I do not care,” he said, “to
contribute personally to the success of this cemetery!”

OPTIMISM DESPITE
LOSS OF ENTIRE LINE

by Harvey Sheirr
Bucknel!’s Bouncing Bunnies will
open the season at home Saturday,
October 7 against Penn State.
In regard to this year’s prospects
Coach Joe Diblin said: “We have lost

our entire front line except for Bob| #
Diedolf who is co-captain with left- |!

fullback Dick Roush. We have some
half-back reserves and one fullback
reserve.”

“There are about 30 fellows trying
out and the first real practice will be
Monday”,
“Nevertheless the fellows are enthusi-
astic and although we are starting
from scratch we will do the best we
can.”

“There are no outstanding players
on the team and this year we will
emphasize condition and team play.”

“This season’s schedule is the best
one we have had as far as home games
are concerned. We play five tussles
at Bucknell. In the opening contest
of the campaign we meet Penn State,
a team that is coached by Bill Jeffries.
Jeffiies is the best coach in the coun-
try,” concluded Coach Diblin.

Jeffries makes a habit of producing
championship teams at Penn State

Last Season’s 34-33 Thriller

FRIDAY,.SEPTEMBEK 22, 1950.

by Clyde McAvoy . :
Buckmellians, like elephants, never forget. This is especially
true where last minute TD’s, after-the-game points, and 34-33 upsets
are concerned. And when Coach Harry Lawrence: turns loose 11
men at kickoff time tomorrow night, that is exactly what they will be

remembering.

The Bullets, on the other hand, will *

be out to make it four straight. over
the Herd. Traditionally “up” for any
kind of contest with the Bisons, Coach
Bream’s downstaters will be trying to
live up to the ballyhoo put out by the
annual “Saturday Evening Post” foot
ball forecast which predicted they
would go undefeated “if they get past
Bucknell.”

Tn spite of the loss of Ross Sachs,
whose on-the-run passing waa the

Clouds of dust rose from a dry field to mix with the sweat and curses of }

98 straining figures, Herb Maack's biting tongue plagued his interior linemen |
without let-up and Jack Guy was demanding nothing less than perfection from
the ends.

But when Harry Lawrence takes the wraps off his 1950 model of split-T
power tomorrow night, most people won’t be thinking of the weeks of work and
full dress rehearsals that went into the fielding of a 200-Ib. plus team. i

It will show, though, And it’ll pay off because, whether Harry will admit
it or not, they’re good. The coaches know it and the team knows it. And!
after tomorrow night Gettysburg will know it. {

There will be a few things different this year. The setting for one thing;
and a few of the principal characters of last year’s tilt will be watching from
the sidelines: But this vietory will be just as much theirs, Jack Mahon for
one. Especially Jack. And Smokey, Jim Hocver, Tippy, Ed Stec, and Ducky,
too, to mention just a few from our side. Sachs, Bowman, and Griffith, and
Snook from their side.

And a few of the rules will be differen The coin toss will be made 10
minutes before the kickoff. This will allow time to announce the starting line-
up after a coach decides whether to start his offensive or defensive squad.

A 15-yard penalty will be given for roughing the place kick holder as |
well as for roughing the kicker. If on an extra point the point {s good, the
roughing team still will be penalized on the ensuing kickoff.

After time-outs, the clock will start running again when the ball is ready

for play, not when it is snapped. And if a hand or forearm is used in block-
ing an opponent, it must be kept below the cpponent's shoulders and must be
jn contact with his body during the entire block. |

Oh, yes, there will be one other- differenc

*18 To 30’ Club Designed T o Help

Educated Beginners Find Employment) 41umw Funp Donors

A. D, Halliwell, executive secretary
of The Scientists’ and Engineers’ As-
sociation, announces that his Associa-
tion has sponsored the “18 to 30 Club”
to help specifically educated beginners
to help each other in finding jobs.

Membership is open to young men
and young women between the ages
of 18 and 80, who have had college
education (from one year through Ph.
D.) or specific education of any kind
after graduation from high school or
ecuivalent.

The “18 to 80 Club” members, while
looking for jobs for themselves, help
each other by trying to secure infor-
mation from employers about jobs
cepen which may be suitable for other
Club members having different quali-
fications. Members list jobs open of
all types (except civil service) where
experience is not required, but where
specific education is required, desired,
or should help. To simplify and stan-
dardize the securing of such job list-
ings, the Club furnishes members with
& printed “Message to Employers”
which explains the Club Plan of co-
operation, and includes a “Job Listing
Form” to be filled in by the employer,
and returned to,the Club.

The requirements of job
thus listed, are compared
qualifications and territoria
of members, and ful
jing specific jobs

open,
with the
nterest
detai egard
ncluding the identi-
ties of employers, are then disclosed

beneficial to the individual because it
tends to increase the effectiveness of
his personal calls by helping to get
him in to see executives at the actual
employing level.

A member may use the Club service
without endeavoring to secure Jist-
ings of jobs for others, but Mr. Halli-
well points out that those who do take
on this extra chore are demonstrating
to employers that they have a cooper-
ative attitude and initiative—qualities
which are usually of very definite in-
terest to employers.

The Club has been set up to func.
tion on @ non-profit cooperative basis,
with only nominal charges to cover
the actual expenses of operation and
zdministration as follows: 10c for
complete information, an enrollment
form, suggestions as to how to get
the names of logical employers for an
individual to call on, and a sample of
the “Message to Employers” form.

After securing the above, a pros-
pective member desiring to use the
Club service, fills in the enrollment
form (which provides spaces for en
tering his education, territoria] inter
ests, etc.) and returns it with a $1.00
enrollment fee. This fee entitles the
member to one “Job Disclosure” if
and when a suitable job is available
and an initial supply of the “Me ge

A new Bucknell Alumni Directory
edited by Dr. Frank G. Davis, alumni
secretary, has just come from the
preas and is now being mailed to all
alumni who have contributed to either
the Heating Plant Campaign or to the
Alumni Fund.

Copies are available only for those
Bucknellians who have made contribu-
tions to either of the funds mention-

the Alumni Fund during the coming
year will aiso be entitled to a copy of
the directory, Dr. Davis announced.

The new directory has been design-
ed primarily to give mailing addresses
for all Bucknellians for whom such
information was available. It is di-
vided into three sections, alphabetical,
class, and geographical. The alpha-
betical section lists names of all living
Bucknellians graduated prior to 1900,
and complete class lists for all groups
graduated since that date. Alumni
are listed by towns within states and

New Engineers Told Key To Success:
‘Esquire’ Recommends Trim Look

by Frank Kelly

WELCOME Freshmen Engineers!!

Speaking jointly for the four engi-
neering societies and the Engineering
Council, I want to wish you a good
start in your careers.

Four years and one summer ses-
sion from now, you will leave Buck-
nell with Bachelor of Science degregs
in your respective branches. Despite
much griping and grumbling about
your instructors, reports, labs, exams,
and the C and F students, I believe
you will graduate with the assurance
of having a good foundation upon
which to build your future.

Your engineering future, however,
depends on other things besides a
diploma, One of these is your con
tacts with the engineering world.

The material which you study as an
undergraduate student is comprised
of fundamentals which act as begin
ning steps toward your goal. - While
you are mastering these steps, the
engineering world doesn't stand stil
and wait for you, moving at
@ comparably

| It is no longer considered smart to
be a broad! Esquire Magazine an-
nounces that the “new trim look” will
soon sweep the country emphasizing
a taller tapered effect for men.

The well dressed gentleman about
town will display T-square lines and
“up”-looking terraced designs. This
sounds more like a problem in me-
chanical engineering than a sport
jacket. The atomic age, maybe.

Wodmen are still permitted their
bustles and wire, but the male of the
species must make peace with his
own shoulders. Padding will hit the
discarded pile along with Windsor
knots

Esquire bases the trim look on what
they cal) natural design principles for
comfort and efficiency, We find no
mention of dungarees, sweat shirts or
even slacks The question now is
whether a tux will take the wear and
tear of chem lab. And what will the
sem gems do without a “broad”
ehoulder weep on?

Entitled Mr. “T”, the new fashion
highlights ten new stylings in men’s
clothing:

on the college campus, the American
student goes heavily in debt, because
of the large portion of his education
which is paid for by other sources
than his parents.

“This”, he said, “Is because on al-
most any college campus in America,
even if your parents or you are pay-
ing your tuition and board, you are
only paying a small portion of the
cost of your education. Probably on
the average of about 50 per cent of
the cost of this education is al! that
ie covered by tuition and fees.”

He added, “Your creditors are not
hard-hearted persons, but they expect
you to pay them by making good
yourself and by developing good citi-
zens and gentlemen.” He referred to
the college benefactors as the stu-
dents creditors.

dressed the assembly, presided over

“What's all the huffin’ and puffin’ about?
I've been a Puffin all my life!”

\

Va may think this “bird” is funny — but he’s no
odder than many of the cigarette tests you're asked to make these days.
One puff of this brand — one sniff of that. A quick inhale — a fast exhale —
and you're supposed to know what cigarette to smoke from then on. The sensible
test doesn’t have to rely on tricks and short cuts. It’s a day-after-
day, pack-after-pack tryout — for 30 days. That’s the
test Camel asks you to make! Smoke Camels regularly for
30 days. Your “T-Zone” ('T for Throat, T for Taste)
is the best possible proving ground for any cigarette.
After you've made the Camel 30-Day Mildness Test,

we believe you'll know why...

More People Smoke Camels
| than any other cigarette!

* “THE SHOOTING WAR”
Once again Bucknellians have returned to resume their studies and col-
{ legiate fun. With the exception of a few renovations, the campus and the
| campus life appears to be unchanged since school ended in June, Yet, this
surface stability presents an elusively deceiving picture, a “new” Bucknell way
of life came into being one Saturday in June.

In Korea, it was the zero hour at 4 4. m. on Sunday, the 25th of June.
Through heavy rain North Korean tank columns moved south across the bor-
der. Soon after an officer in Seoul, South Korean capital, said: “This looks
like the real thing.” The events of the past three months have completely
verified that remark. The “cold war” which had been chilling the world’s hops
for interwational peace had suddenly and rapidly boiled over into a moderately
large-scaled shooting war.

The action of the United States was swift and aggressive. President Tru-

Gridders Gird For Muhlenberg ,
After Suspenseful G-Burg Tilt ||

by Harvey Sheirr

A first period outburst carried the
Bucknell Bisons a 20-15 victory
over Gettysburg in the opening tussle
of the campaign at Memorial Stadium
Jast Saturday night before 8500 fans.
The triumph avenged last season’s
34-33 loss at the hands of the Bullets.

Bob Albert, Van Johnson, and Dick
Hetsko sparked the Herd to a win that
was in doubt right down to the last
wo minutes, Albert scored two touch-
downs and passed for another. John-
gon contributed consistent running
gains and Hetsko snared the touch-
down pass from Albert that proved to
be the winning margin.

Before the game Bucknell won the
toss and elected to receive. Hetsko

by Ronnie Unger

Fresh from their triumph over a
hard-fighting Gettysburg eleven, the
Bucknell Bisons wil! ride herd over to
Allentown Pa, this Saturday after-
noon for their second football encoun-
ter of the year. This game will be
the opening tilt for a veteran-studded
“Mule” team.

By switching a couple of backs to
center and guard, Coach Howard
Baughman could field a starting line-
up of eleven lettermen. Among these
performers are big George England
whose throwing arm may cause the
Orange and Blue considerable difficul-
ty. Then too, Elmo Jackson, Harry
Kreutzberg and Ernie Wescoe, all
dangerous scatbacks, will put our de-
fensive line to a stern test.

Another year and another roster of
programe coming to the students from
WVBU. Under the direction of Ed
McComsey, this semester promises to
be the most outstanding that the
litle blue and white studio has seen.
Beter programs, better ads, and bet-
ter cooperation are all on Ed's list of
plans for the station. It looks like a
stellar year so join the band wagon.

The first general meeting of the ac-
tives, pledges, and all those interested
in WVBU will be held Thursday night
at 7:00 in Hunt Rec Room. If you
have any talent in directing, dramat-
ics, publicity or announcing be sure
to show up. For those interested in
advertising and engineering, WVBU
has a place. Working for the station
is fun and is rewarding too. So don’t
forget to attend the meeting.

—o-
Why Don't They... .?
«Have a weekly quartet program,
and other programs devoted to local
singing talent, or would thig put a
few disc jockey shows in the hole?

Give a half hour a week over to the
fraternities and tell them to present
their best talent. Then have judges
pick the best program, Same can be
done to sororities.

Broadcast more intramurals and all
college events.

Now They’ve Done It.,..

Gotten a radiator at the station.

Decided to paint the walls for sani-
ary and esthetic purposes both (also
to lure in more help?)

Gotten a stricter code of discipline
for all those having programs and all
violators of program ethics.

Revised the constitution so WVBU
will be more closely integrated, in-
stead of a loosely centered organiza-
tion with a dogmatic head.

After Escapade In Africa

by Janie Brown
Jack Larson, '50, recently returned from a trapping expedition in Africa,
is now eating steak and french fries instead of monkey stew and ronsted rat.

The Lambda Chi Coast Guard vet-
eran who left for Liberia, Africa in
February was trapping wild animals
for American zoos, He docked at
Fall River, Mass., last month accom.
panied by monkeys, leopards, pythons
and even a smal! hippipitamus.

Jack realized a life-long ambition
with his present job and returned to
the United States temporarily only
because of the African rainy season.

Bear Slayer To Return

He plans to come back here for a
visit within the next few weeks and
join Chet Kendter for some hunting.
Jack and Chet were directly respon-
sible for the huge bear which lay in
front of the Bison last fall.

While in Monrivia, the Liberian
capital, Jack shared his hotel room
with a black leopard cub. The room
mates were apparently an amiable
combination for the young cat is now
Jack’s tame pet.

Various Adventures

Larson spent most of his time in
the “bush” (jungle to the uninitiated)
recruiting natives to assist him in
trapping. His adventures include
hearing a mysterious native “talking
rock” and being bitten by an angry
python.

It seems that in spite of all these
events Jack’s worst job was speaking
to a meeting in his home town.

Dr. Harold E. Cook

Returns From Tour

Dr. Harold E. Cook, professor of
music, has returned to Lewisburg to
resume his duties as head of the de-
partment of music after a_ three.
month tour of England and France.

The music department head devoted
the major portion of his trip to se-
‘ection of books and acores for his
personal music library. His collect-
ion of several hundred pieces centered
around 18th Century scores and books
on theory, harmony, music history,
and French opera.

University Guidance Center
Helps Solve Your Problems

Do you find it difficult to get along with the opposite sex?
Are you in doubt as to what type of a job you should prepare for?
Do you find that there does not seem to he enough time in the day to get

everything done that you have to do?
The Answer

If so go to Bucknell’s Guidance
Center and meet Mr. W. H. Kieft who
knows more about you than you know
about yourself What he does not
know, he knows how to find out. It
is not that Mr. Kieft is unusually in-
quisitive about the habits of Buck-
nellians but the information ali comes
to him as part of his job as Director
of Testing of Bucknell’s Guidance
Center on Sixth Street.

to accomplish. Frank would run
down to the gymnasium for an hour
or two, sometimes it stretched out
into an afternoon, and when he came

President Re-Emphasizes Warning
On Drinking At Frat Houses

Staff Reporter

In a serious but not a threatening tone, President Horace A. Hil

(Editor's Note: “Campus Life” is a new column to appear each week.
It deals’ with important issues in the world today as they relate to the
Bueknell student body.)
by Ronald Unger
COLOR, RELIGIOUS AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION A’F BUCKNELL?
I'm sure that few if any of you who read this column consider yourself
bigoted or prejudiced. I'm sure each and every one of you adheres in some
form or another to the principles of personal integrity and personal equality.
Yet every day in every way a great majority of the students on this campus
are giving support to those concepts which purport segregation and racial,
religious superiority by setting up certain undemocratic standards for select-
ion into a group.
We “like to believe” as Americans living in a land of the free under Dem-
ocratic morals and principles that we are truly Democratic. Moreover, we as
students at Bucknell University, a Christian institution, sincerely “like to be-

|| lieve” that our campus presents « picture of “little Democracy” at work.

Qur belief is founded in the strong faith of all free institutions—the faith
that says men are entitled to certain rights as human beings regardless of
inherent capabilities. None of us are naive enough to think that “equality,
fraternity,” and justice as individuals” applies to inherited capabilities, but
rather to social and moral equalness.

Unfortunately for Bucknell, what we should “like to believe” and what
is the “truth” are two relatively incompatible points. The truth of the mat.
er is that with the exception of a few isolated cases, the fraternities on this
campus actively propagate the concept of racial and religious segregation.

Any individual who belongs to an organization which actively promotes
and “lives by” the concept of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or
color is supporting that concept himself, regardless of personal feelings.

In order to be fair and to obtain a fuller picture of this practice of dis-
crimination it is proper to look at the reasons for its continuance at our insti-
tution. The first point, to my knowledge, made by those who advocate the

| present fraternity system is that the Southern fraternity groups would secede

from the organization if the national organization advocated and demanded
that every frternity place a “nonsectarian’” clause in their constitutions.

Second, it is often said and with considerable validity that a more cohesive
homogeneous organizatio fe ed wher f “your own kind.”
Finally, it is said that no group or individual in our Democracy has the right
to tell another up or individual he or she should conduct affair

Insofar as the first point is concerned the National Interfraternity Coun
cil at its Washington Convention on November 26, 1949 recommended “that

this question in the light of prevailing conditions and take such steps as the
may elect to eliminate selectivity provisions

gatherings of about two dozen fresh-
men per group, such topics as “Sor-
orities and Fraternities’, “the Inter-
national Situation”, “Extra-Curricu-
lar Activities”, ‘Budgeting Your
Time”, and “Boy-Girl Relationships”
are discussed. Each group's discus-
sion is prompted by two upperclass-
men, @ boy and a girl, whose wide-
spread experience is of great aid in
unraveling the problems and ponder-
ings of the Freshmen.
Activities Too

The groups meet in the dormitories
or the homes of faculty members.
Meetings of a more social nature are
held in the Bison, or in the Sweet
Shoppe. Hayrides and Hikes have
also been planned.

Already 363 Freshmen have signed
up. If any other Freshmen wish to
join one of these groups, they may
do so at the C. A. Office in Roberts
Hall. Don’t miss this opportunity,
Freshmen, to discuss your problems
with your classmates and at the same
time, get the “scoop” from some up-
perclassmen.

Leaders

The upperclassmen in charge of
these groups are as follows: Mel
Woodward, Alice Kerchner, Jane Gale,
Dick Arnesman, Jack Rickart, Pat
Lewis, Bill Bellamy, Jane Brown, Ed
Blick, Lou Hind, Dick Brooks, Mary

However. it is this writer's firm belief that whatever advantages can be ob.

Students and fans will see last
year’s Eastern Intercollegiate No. 1
ground gainer this Saturday when
Lehigh’s fabulous Diek Gabriel dis-
plays his wares against the once-
beaten Bucknell eleven in a game that
will mark the first time the two
teams have met in 22 years.

Buckne}l has faced Lehigh 13 times
in a series which began in 1888 when
Lehigh defeated the Herd. The
Bisons have triumphed in eight con-
tests while losing three, and two
tussles ended in stalemates.

Lehigh has not beat@én Bucknell
since October 18, 1900, when the En.
gineers won, 12-6. The last game be-
tween the two teams was November
10, 1928 when the Bisons pasted Le-
high, 40.0.

This season the Engineers have
played two contests and won both.

For the first time in the history of
Bucknell-Penn State soccer relations,
the Nittany Lions will travel to Lewis-
burg for the season's opener this Sat.
urday morning at 10:00 o'clock on
North Field.

The Lions, who have consistently
fielded top soccer elevens, are rated
among the Eastern powers. And
their coach, Bill Jeffrey has been
termed by the experts as “one of the
nation’s best”,

Coach Joe Diblin has been working
his squad overtime in an attempt to
“shape them up” for the big encoun-
ter. The squad itself is the largest
in years, due partly to the furious
search Diblin is making to find men
to replace those lost through gradu-
ation last spring.

The team is concentrating on each
game as it comes. However, no one
can keep quiet the secret “Bouncing
Bunny” ambition to bring back to the
campus the coveted Middie Atlantic
Championship Trophy

Heading the squad are c¢o-captains
Dick Roush and Bob  Diedolf, but

Lewisburg, Pa.

Dear Ed:

Please inform your readers that
I'm very much put out about my mis-
information of last week. My know]-
edge of Carlisie helped to some ex
tent, but the weather fouled me up.

Had the fog not rolled in, Bucknell
would surely have given the Mules a
good kicking. Had the grass not
been so slippery, Syracuse would have
beaten Temple. Same goes for Deni-

‘| son’s upset of Washington and Jeffer

son (those last two fellows never did
hit it off too well).

Granted, I am keeping abreast of
my contemporaries, but I won’t b
satisfied until all my predictions come
true. Right now I have just ir
pleted a survey of the weather pr
pects for the weekend. My forecast
will be partly based or e result

Village Voice

by Bill Wakefield

Since our weekly papet is “The
Student Voice of Bucknell,” the vet-
erans and their ‘families of Bucknell
Village feel that a column should
originate from the friendly little com-
munity across highway 15. This is
not a new idea, but is a new venture
for this writer, We shall try to come
forth with some interesting reading,
and sincerely hope that our efforts
will not be entirely in vain.

A quick “census” reveals that all
apartments are occupied at the pres-
ent time. There are 36 children scam-
pering about—aged from 1 month to
12 years (those below 6 months are
doing more crying, crawling, and
creeping than scampering, of course).
They teil me, too, that come the bud-
ding of the tulips next spring, our
population will be increased by sev-
eral “little villagers.” Even a casual
glance here and there will substan-
tiate this -persistent rumor. Get the
cigars ready, boys!

Larry Keifer, formerly of Apt. 15-
E, is now serving as a first lieutenant
with Sunbury’s National Guard unit.
Larry bought a house trailer and took
his family to Alabama with him. He’s
the Village’s first loss to the present
crisis. Good luck, Larry!

Chet Selner of Apt. 17-F received
painful arm and facial burns Sunday
morning in attempting to light his
gas water heater. An accumulation
of leaking gas is a pesky thing to
deal with, Chet will assure you with-
out hesitation So be careful with
th water heaters, neighbo

Meetings Start Rolling

by Frank Kelly

The Engineers really started rolling

last week with three of the four so-
cieties holding meetings on Thursday.
The ASCE meeting opened with a
welcome to the Freshmen by Mel
Sheridan at which time a directory of
the CE students was passed out to a!!
members who were present.
_ Following the election of Bob Bab-
bitt as the Chapter Treasurer, Pro-
fessor Weeden gave a talk on “Cold
Weather Engineering”. The talk was
based upon his own experiences in the
tundra region of Alaska while he was
doing military research for the gov-
ernment.

After the meeting was adjourned,
there was an inspection of the CE
labs for the Freshmen and refresh-
ments were served. The CEs are
holding their next meeting on Thurs-
day, October 12, at 4:30 in the after-
noon. The program, thus far, in
cludes a movie.

The AIEE opened a new year with
the election of Ed Gurdack as repre-
sentative to the Engineering Council
and a talk by a sudent speaker. Ed
Prokop, Senior EE, spoke on “Piezo-

told how the mechanical deformation
of a crystal will produce o potential
difference across it or if a potential
difference is applied across a crystal,
a mechanical deformation will result.
Such crystals and the piezo-electric
effect find application in radar, sonar,
and many phases of communication
work.

The ASME meeting commenced
with a greeting by Don Betty, presi-
dent, who explained about the ASME
and the various advantages of joining
the organization. Next, the tentative
program for the year was outlined
wih stress being applied to the prac-
tical viewpoint of the theory which is
learned in class. This will be brought
out by having various speakers, also
movies, and as many inspection trips
as possible. The program concluded
with the signing up of students for
the society and the serving of refresh
ments.

The Bucknell Engineer is looking
for more men for its editorial and
business staffs. All engineers who
may be interested should contact
Howard Heinaman, Senior EE, any
evening at the Teke house. Their
new phone number is 5-15900. They
are especially interested in lower
classmen who will have a chance to
become familiar with the magaine so
that they can take over in the future
years

Number 2... THE BLOW FISH

“Shucks—I blew in when I should’ve blown out!”

P, the poor Piscis! He’s been making all those

trick cigarette tests you've been reading about! He's taken one puff of this

brand — one sniff of that. A quick inhale of cigarette “A” —a fast exhale

of cigarette “B” — and he’s still confused! Seriously, isn’t the sensible way to

test a cigarette to smoke pack after pack, day after day?

That’s the test Camel asks you to make —

only Camels — regularly for 30 days. Your ‘“T-Zone’

. Sem Gems’ European Vacations Sound|

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

Both Fabulous And Enlightening

by Bobbie Maurer
During the summer, while many of us were busy at work, some of our
lucky Sem Gems managed to traverse the hills and dales of far-off lands. Their
exclamations over the marvelous times had by all left us enthralled and a bit

envious,

Ally Kerchner went to Europe with
the National Intercollegiate Christian
Council. She and a friend spent a
week with a baron in Saumur, France.
He was a retired wine merchant, and
they were in all their glory, constant-
ly being served, hand and foot. They
managed to catch a glimpse of the
English king and princess in church,
and even had tea with Sir Walter
Moberly, author of “Crisis In The
University.”

Ally met Bobby Hooven ’50, and
Bobby Lenox '50, at a cocktail party
in Paria, and bumped into Joe Ruben-
stein ’50, on the street. She was also
surprised at finding out that the guide
who took them around a German D. P.
camp graduated from Bucknell in 743.
Austria, according to Ally, was the
most beautiful, while Vienna was the
most interesting, since the four
powers are occupying that region.

Fabulous Tour

Dottie Varni traveled with the N.
&. A. tour. She exclaimed that Paris
was “fabulous”. They eat good food
and drink al! day long there. It
seems that “the thing to do” every
night, is to go to Les Hals, the mar-
keplace, at 4:00 a. m. for onion soup.

In contrast, the food was very bad
in London, and everything closed up
at 11:00 p The “tea” tradition
evidently prevai when Dottie

friend 1) the beauty
t leone came

al —

old are you?” Then they gradually
lead up to, “Will you marry me?”
Don’t be too excited, though; what
they really want is a method of get-
ing into the United States. Dotgie
also bumped into Bobby Hooven and
Bobby Lenox in England, and Sue
Davis '50, and Sally Angle '50, in
Paris.
NSA Tourists

Louise and Vieve Fowle °49, joined
an N. 8. A. tour and had a marvelous
time. They looked on at a Commun-
ist Youth rally in London. The Com-
munists are powerful speakers and
try to penetrate people's minds by
continually repeating, “You can’t stop
the struggle of the common man.”
The girls visited Eton, Oxford, and
Cambridge, and joined the students

the fall fashions in a renowned fash-

and consisted of nothing under $200.
Molly ran into Emmy Hill '49, in Lon-

saw Nancy Kerslake several times.

college students, went over on the

Hildreth Discusses UMT,
ROTC Possibility Here

Attention to scholarship will go far to keep a student in the ivy-covered
halls instead of the drill ground, President Horace A. Hildreth told hundrpds
of parents at a program held in their honor Saturday evening in Davis Gym-

Jaek Headstrong Emerges As Hero

j fraterna zanization
Visualize American Status in the eyes of the rest of the world as the
U. 8. S. R. proclaims American hypocrisy. We spend billions trying to pre
serve Democracy in Europe, Asia, ete., but in our own backyard, we leave our
selves open to serious attack, As I have noted the fraternity system of dis
crimination forms a segment upon which that attack is made.

In the id place, I feel that my fellow students should be fully aware
that this issue omething to think about and discuss with other students and
the faculty. The importance of being aware cannot be over-emphasized, be
cause there is a resolution pending before the Bucknell interfraternity counci
on this very issue. At a meeting held on May 1,. 1960, one fraternity on cam

#| pus made the following recom mendation: “That the Bucknell Interfraternity
Council, in the light of Bucknell’s heritage of Amopican democracy and Christ
ian principle, adopt a policy favoring the abolition of all racial and religious
@iscrimination in all fraternal groups on the Bucknell campus.”

This recommendation grew out of the resolution passed by the National
Interfraternity Couneil at its Washington Convention on November 26, 1949
roe Ww. . stating Grst: “Many member fraternities have had and now have restrictive
.. Lit. Aud. provisions”; second, “The question is of concern to many interested parties” ;
eee eT third, “Fraternity membership is an individual responsibility” ; fourth, “Mem-
ber fraternities that do have selective membership provisions should consider
this question in the light of prevailing conditions and take such steps as they

may elect to eliminate selectivity provisions.” | a

This resolution was passed by a standing vote with the count of 36 affirm-

ative, 3 negative, and 19 abstaining. In short, considerable authority rests in

the hands of local chapters Thus, I feel that fraternity, non-fraternity, and
future fraternity men should be well aware of the facts in order that ignor-
ence cannot be used as excuse for fraternity actions.

Concerning the nature of the last article's proposition, | feel that I have

made myself quite clear, 1 believe and shall continue to believe that fraterni-

ties which contain clauses that discriminate on the husie of race, religion, or

, color serve to brand their members as Promoting segregation by action, pot

necessarily by personal belief.

My challenge stilt stands. I welcome all articles regardless of their fav

orableness or adversity. Iam of the firm conviction that this issue is close

, to every student's heart and as uch, every student should have his say.

Answering questions put to him by
parents, Dr. Hildreth discussed the
draft and the possibility of the estab-
lishment of an ROTC unit here

Sentiment among college adminis-
trators present indicates a swing in
favor of Universal Military Training,
Dr. Hildreth reported. Military of-
ficials who spoke showed an aware-
ness of the danger of draining off
skilled men from the professions and
industrial or scientific training pro-
grams which are so vitally needed in
peace or in war, he added, ,

The president also answered ques-
tions about the University’s place-
ment service, its scholarship program
and other campus issues.

Entertainment at the gymnasium
included presentations of several
songs by the Men’s Glee Club and the
Women's Glee Club. Violin solos
were played by W. R. Miller, instruc-
tor in music, An informal reception
followed the program.

This book is being read by over a
hundred students and faculty mem-

groups, meeting every two or three

weeks to discuss Moberly's ideas and.

to try and apply his solutions to Buck-
nell problems, have been formed.

Each group has a faculty and a stu-
dent chairman. Dr. George Irland
and H. B. Heinaman, Jr. are the chair-
men for the Engineering group while

RUSHING UNDER WAY?

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

Village V oice

by Bill Wakefield

Talented Frank Hoffman of 8-C is
currently serving as director of the
Lewisburg Community Theater Guild’s
play “Light Up The Sky,” which vill
be presented November 2 and 8 in the
Lewisburg High School Auditorium.
As a member of Cap and Dagger and

the Theater Guild, Frank worked in|

various capacities in all the plays
produced by those’ organizations last
year. .

Other villagers to play a big part
in making “Light Up The Sky” a hit
will be Doris Ivey of 21-G and Sallie

Peters of 48-P. Doris will play the |

part of “Stella,” a flamboyant old
hoodlum, and will have to do some
clever acting to change herself sud-
denly from her real self of an ensy-
going, congenial mother of three chil-
dren to the outspoken egotism re-
quired of her part in the play. Sallie
is taking part by helping prepare the
scenery, It’s a feather in the vil-
lage’s cap to be so well represented
in the Guild, and it would be a fine
gesture on the part of all villagers
to turn out and see the play.

All “old” villagers expreas a hearty
welcome to the following “new” vil-
lagers, who have joined the commun-
ity since June; Mr. and Mrs.: Cyril
Good, Al Solokas, Al Bradley, Art
Featherstone, Bill Anderson, John
Tilton, Paul Evans, Cecil Hornbeck,
H. Easton, Chet Selner, George Gra-
vell, Don Hill, Jim Sharadin, Mylor
Ogan, Wes Lloyd, John Milligan, Lee
Walters, Laurence Foley, Clarence

Beiber, and Leonard Moore

Engine Ears P

by Frank Kelly

The highlight of the past week's
engineering activities was a talk by
John T. West Jr., Secretary of the
Pennsylvania Society of Professional
Engineers, sponsored by the Engi-
neering Council.

Jim Hunt, senior ChE and president
of the Council, introduced Mr. West
who spoke on ‘“Registration—Why
and How” as pertaining to the pro-
fessional engineering classification
granted by the states. He told how
the policy of registration is a unified
attempt to put engineering on the
same professional level as medicine
and law.

Through the registration of all en-
gineers and their resultant action
under a code of ethics and set stand-
ards, it would be possible to “(1)
stop the practice of engineering by
the non-engineer, (2) stop the misap-
propriation and abuse of the designa-
tion ‘engineer’, (3) oust from the pro-
fession those who prove incompetent
and unworthy; and (4) preserve to
the qualified engineer his rights of
practice against restriction, encroach-
men and unqualified competition”. He
also brought out the fact that many
engineering phases are not legally
sound unless approved or done by a
registered engineer

Although Mr. West's talk mainly

concerned the seniors, it certainly
gave all the students present a con-
crete idea of the importance of main-
taining their profession as the safe-
guard of life, health and property,

Any senior engineers who may be
interested in the history and proced-
ure of registering should see this au-
thor. I have some literature on the
subject and some mimeographed post
cards requesting a copy of the Penn-
sylvania Registration Act and an ap-
plication for Certificate as an Engi-
neer-in-Training. Registration ag an
Engineer-in-Training in Pennsylvania
requires neither a resident's status
nor an entrance examination.

The opening meeting of the AIChE
on October 2nd included three short
movies; one being a March of Time
film on atomie energy. 4

Ed Yancavage was chosen as the
Junior representative for the Engl-
neering Council at that meeting. The
ChE plans for the immediate future
are centeted sround a banquet, ten-
tatively scheduled for November 15th.
The banquet committee has been ore
ganized under Dick Weiner.

Sixteen members of the senior EB
class made the trip to the AIEE eon-
vention at Baltimore on October 4th,
They attended several of the lectures

In C&D’s, “Ah, Wilderness”

by Jim Di Guiseppi
More than 100 students, including many freshmen, could be seen in Buek-
nell Hall on the nights of October 4, 5, and 6, diligently striving for a part in
the next Cap and Dagger play, Eugene O'Neill's, “Ah, Wilderness!”

After having the students read and
enact the parts several times, the
casting committee was finally able to
determine which student fit which
part.

Casting Committee

The casting committee, headed by
director Robert Landrum, and includ-
ing Harvey Powers, Theta Alpha Pi
representative, and Margo Rauch, (
& D. representative, is very enthused
over the interest shown by the entire
group at the tryouts, and have pron
ised that this play will certainly be
worth seeing.

The play will be presented at 8:15

business is to survive, business men must realize their responsibilities to raise
the standard of living, improve working conditions, and develop other neces-

sury standards.

Speaking to a large audience, Mr.
Prentis pointed out that economic
freedom a part of the soul of
America. He emphasized the fact
that the system of free competitive
business has produced a standard of
iiving never before reached by any
nation.

In establishing his second point,
“that private competitive business has
placed more goods at the hands of
more people than ever before, Mr.
Prentis, refuted three well-known ar-
guments against big-business. Speak-
ing from his experience he told the
audience that the element of competi-
tion among the big companies made
it virtually impossible for them to re-
sort to collusion to “fix prices.”

“Manufacturers do not hold down
production to force higher prices,” he
continued, “for to do so would mean
that overhead expenses would pile up
immeasurably.” In answering the
charge that business is making excess
profits, Mr. Prentis pointed out that
manufacturers make less than six
cents on the dollar without paying
dividends and other expenses

Iustrating the evils of compulsory
planning, Mr. Prentis made his third
point. He said that under mpul-
sory planning in other nations,

freedom of worship and other free.

period of silence to decide which was
the one for you? That's the way the
rule ran in 1981.

In these days rushing began Friday |
morning at 7:30 and continued until
4:00 p. m me following Thursday at
which time a two-hour period of si-
lence was observed by the freshmen.
(What deep meditation must have re-
sulted!) At 6:00 that evening the
freshman was to go to “the house of ;
his choice.” At the present time, a
silence is observed by the freshmen
all day Sunday.

Another rule laid down by Senior
Council in that year is still in effect.
“A fraternity could bid a freshman,
at any time during rushing season,
but there could be no formal accept-
ance of the bid.”

According to one professor's mem-
ory, prior to this time the freshmen
were rushed the moment they hit the
station. (Must have been a tense few
days). This probably is what caused
the above change in rules.

Keep It Clean, Boys!

i
i
i

Ran vnenanonesonneconsecesoaseconegsaagse

“Although we got quite a kick last week out of comparing fra-
ternity rushing at Bucknell to “The Greatest, Show oy Earth,”
Wwe must admit that the Fraternity system here is deep-rooted,
and therefore must have some merit.

The National Interfraternity Council has been on the spot in
the past few years. They realize that there are a lot of things
wrong with the various member chapters, but rather than capitu-
late to non-fraternity pressure they are trying to “clean house”.

The process of improving the fraternity system will be a long
one. The changes will not be made overnight, but the changes
will be made. Or else!

We are of the firm belief that our campus fraternities are
rather well-coordinated during the greater part of the college
year. It is during this week that the spirit of cooperation ends
and “dirty rushing” begins.

The answer lies not in a “stronger Interfraternity Council,”
but in the minds of each campus fraternity man.

Dirty rushing is a dirty term. The IFC has an outstanding
record of doing nothing about it. But what can they do?

Each fraternity that commits dirty rushing makes it their
business to “get something on” the other houses. No one ever
makes any formal complaints, because there is always that fear
of retaliation

Dirty rushing begins in the minds of the individual fratern-
ity men. It must end there!

If a fraternity believes that they can attract men by defam-
ing a competitor, then their sense of value is distorted.

We will have dirty rushing here until fraternity men realize
that their system is threatened from the inside as well as the out-
side.

Jur Fraternities must
a t sa

tick together. If they can’t find any-
bout their rivals, then they are indirectly con
fraternity system.

The following courses now have exams in the library files:
Algebra, Trigonometry, Analytic Geometry, Integral Calculus,
Differential Calculus, and Advanced Calculus.

Professor S. Selby, head of the mathematics department,
feels that this is a big step in the elimination of cheating and the
better feeling between faculty and student body
“We don’t feel that using old tests to study for future ones iis
cheatir he said

“To let the student know this we have set up this file and we
hope that the students will take advantage of it. However, we
don't want them to work these problems out and come to test
with a book full of crib notes,” concluded Professor Selby.

by Ronald Unger
BUCKNELL—A CENTER OF HIGHER LEARNING?

Few, if any of us, during the course of our four years ever stop to give
serious thought to the full meaning of the word Bucknell—University. Most
of us have a vague, fuzzy idea of the surface distinction between colleges and

‘I
ae a University is a place, which offers courses above the under-
graduate level, thus distinguishing it from a college, In the other hand, there
are a few who believe that the essence of a University as distinguished from
eclleges, high schools, etc., transcends this mere superficial distinction. These
people believe that the life-blood of a University is the essential respect of
every individual for the rights and privileges of his fellow man.

I believe that higher education, has its central point of value the growth
of character through the art of learning how to use one’s mind in the project
of thinking. Certainly, of the very heart of one’s growth of character is the
development of a personal morality, a personal integrity which stamps you
an an individual to be reapected.

I'm sure that most of us are in pursuit of this thing called personal integ-
rity. We attend our church of preference on Sunday, and we pray to God to
give us the strength and the courage to lead good lives. Yet, during the fo!
lowing week as many as 99% of us who have given our hearts to God, violate
the very beliefs that we established.

Yes, I would venture to say that 99% of our students have during the
course of their lives cheated on an examination. In high school it was consid.

- | ered the vogue by our fellow students to get the best grades in the best way

possible. Now, we are in college and our main worries are whether er not
we shall get into the best professional school, or obtain a high paying jeb.
Once again too many of us in our maturing years at Bucknell University have
not taken stock of anything else but how to get the highest grades and still do
the least work possible. In following this motto, we have found it convenient
to cheat on an examination.

The heck with building character. The heck with learning how to think
honestly. All we're worried about is how many Q. C.’s we can accumulate
during our four years at this institution of “higher learning.” In our bul
sessions, in our churches we profess the inherent integrity of man and his gift
of renasonwhich serves to promulgate that integrity However, we should
rather sel! all those high-sounding phrases and words up the river, if it means
that we won't make Dean’s List, or we will flunk a course.

In answer to the accusation that “you have cheated on an examination,”
people often remark, “I saw others doing it, and I don't think it is fair that he
should do better than I’. Here, we have the erux of the situation. The great
emphasis at Bucknell University lies in the achievement of marks. In propor-
tion to this emphasis, relatively little spotlight is played upon he true essence
of a University which [ moted above. Nobody is worried about personal integ
rity, if it means doing poorly.

The ult of the kee

petition which we wage for the best grades to
get the highest he iat Bucknell no longer resembles a University ir
the true sense of the word. The feeling of essential respect for every person
rights and privileges has b re virtually extant
None of us appear to realize that when we go out inte the world, we may

' possibly achieve our job, our status by our grades and extra-curricular work.
| However, once we gain the job we keep it by our own personality, our ewn abil-
| ity and trustworthiness, If we maintain the true essence of a University, we
shall build within ourselves the type of charweter necessary to maintain our
work status and our personal status in everyday living. People will look up
| to us as individuals who live as they pray and speak. Furthermore, we shall

spect of man.

C&D Lead, James Gregg,
Has Wealth Of Experience

Vet Star Gains Thorough Seasoning
At Adelphi And In Service Shows
by J. L. Di Guiseppt

James Gregg, sophomore transfer student from Adelphi College,
will bring a great amount of theatrical experience with him when he

takes the lead role in “Ah, Wilderness!”,

While a student at Sewanhake High
Schoo), in Garden City, Long Island,
Gregg was very active in dramatics.
He played leading roles in each class
play and also aided in the direction of
them.

Because of the great amount of
time spent in dramatic#, Gregg had
very little time for other activities,
but still managed to find time to be-
come one of the leaders of the Student
Council.

In Air Foree

After graduation Gregg entered the
U. 8. Air Force where he attained the
rank of Sergeant, being an instructor
in radio. He spent three years in the
service, and when he was stationed at
Scott Field, Tilinois, played the lead
role in an all soldier performance of
“I'll Eat My Hat.”

In 1949 Gregg entered Adelphi Col-
lege, Long Island, and while there his
dramatic talents came into promi-
nence. A fisting of all of his work in
the past year is too extensive at this
time, ag only the outstanding ones
will be mentioned. He starred in
“Tinder Box", a post-Civil War pro-
duction, the screen rights to which
were bought by Hollywood. This play
was directed by H. G. Graham, of 20th
Century-Fox. Another play directed
by Graham, “Nuts & Peanuts”, by
Herbert Nelson, found Gregg in a
supporting role to ten professional
artists

Also while at Adelphi, Gregg was a

ap & Dagger’s next play. .

HOWARD UNIVERSITY
PLAYERS TO PRESENT
“INSPECTOR GENERAL”

All Bucknellians and persons from
the surrounding area have a treat of
rare excellence in store for them be-
fore Christmas.

On December 9, 1950, the very pop-
ular and well known Howard Univer-
sity Players from Washington will
present the play “The Inspector Gen-
eral” by Nikolai Gogal in the Lewis-
burg High School auditorium. The
sponsor of this outstanding group is
the Bucknel] University Chapter of
the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored Peopie, John
Harmon, president.

The Howard Players have recently
returned from a European tour, where
Ibsen’s “Doll’s House” was presented
before royalty. They have received
great acclaim, especially from Nor-
way, for their performances.

“The Inspector General” satirizes
the political corruption of the Russian
Court of Nickolas I (1836).

by George R. Faint, registrar of the
University. Of this number, four are
women,

Of the 143 graduate and special
students, 85 are veterans. The pro-

groups from the senior class of 461
students, with 144 veterans, to the

The junior class, with 532 members,
has 146 veterans, while there are only
52 sophomores out of a class enroll-
ment of 455 who served in the armed

“Count to ten!”

These are just a few of the answer:
that the- normal Bucknellians gave
under hypnotic suggestion October 11,
at the Philosophy Club meeting.

Mr. John Rausnaught, an Albright
graduate, demonstrated the power of
hypnotism over minds. While work-
ing on Anne Vastine he was able to
retrogress her to her sixth birthday:
She showed utter abhorence when of-
fered a cigarette but relished her lol-
lypop. Even her speech, handwriting,
and mannerisms were those of a six
year old. In further experiments Mr.
Fausnaught had Margo Rauch peddle
paper sacks to the audience as cater-
pillar traps. Bob Stover is probably
still spelling his name as “Smokey
Stoverr”. Mr. Fausnaught was also
able to have his subjects see butter.
flies, caterpillars and seven fingers on
one hand. His powers of anesthesea
amazed the audience, for only the au-
dience felt discomfort when he stuck
a needie in Miss Vastine’s hand.

Mr. Fausnaught became interested
in hypnosis when he saw a demon
stration in Danville. He stated that
anyone who studies hypnotism can
practice it. It is very handy when
used in therapy and as a pain reliever

n dentistry. Mr. Fausnaught will be

Apply ‘The Crisis In The University’
Solutions To Problems At Bucknell

Last Thursday six faculty members and six students of the Natural
Science Division teed off the first in a series of discussions on Sir Walter Mo-

berly’s book “The Crisis In The University.”

The purpose of the meeting was

tu discuss Moberly's ideas and try to apply his solutions to Bucknel) problems.

Dr. Manning Smith of the chemistry
department reviewed the first two
chapters for the group. The primary
questions raised were: What type of
college is Bucknell What are the
duties of this type of school?; How
does Bucknell stand up in a survey of
its class of school ?

Dr. Smith noted that through his
tory three basic types of universitie
have developed, The earliest was
classified as the Christian Hellenic
University where the stress was on
the culture The automatic by-pre
duct of this type of schooling was the
philosophical ieader. The schools of
fered personal tutoring with a strict
systematic curriculum

The Liberal University, which lay
its foundation esearch and lear

Meyers And Talmage Shine
In Rout As Herd Assumes
Last Year’s Winning Form
by Clyde MeAvoy

The sun shone through (so to
speak) last Saturday night at Wash-

ington & Jefferson College and bathed |;

the Bisons benevolently in the warm
rays of a 34-0 victory.

In a relatively slow game played on
a muddy field, the rebounding Herd
pulled out all the stops to impeach the
Presidents handily while 2500 victory
atarved W&J students looked glumly
on.

The Lawrence charges never once
allowed their opponents inside the
20-yard line and rolled up a 28-0 lead
in the third quarter before allowing
the reserves to take over for mopping
up.

Two In 2nd

Rolling towards pay dirt several
times in the first quarter and always
stymied by that old foe, fumbleitis,
the visiting Herd finally surged over
twice in the 2nd quarter, with Meyers
carrying both times.

And with the smell of blood there
was no stopping the Boys from Buck
nell as they scored two more fast ones
right after the second half kickoff on
a Dean to McKibbon aerial and an
other line smash by the ever present

eave This Week For Colgate To Face Red Raiders On Own Stamping Grounds

Herd Will Aim For Upset
Over Powerful Colgate
In Toughest Go Of Year

by Harvey Sheirr

The 1960 football campaign has
produced an unusual number of up-
sets and the Bucknell Bisons hope to
add to this list when they face their
toughest foe in Colgate Saturday at
Hamilton, New York. Satarday {s
Colgate’s homecoming game.

This year in Colgate’s sixtieth grid-
iron season but the Herd has only
faced the Red Raiders twice. Each
team has conquered the other once.
In 1894 Bucknel! downed Colgate, 12-
8 and in 1917 Colgate whipped the
Bisons, 13-0.

So far this year Colgate has won
two games and dropped one while the
Bisons have a record of two and two.
Colgate lost its first tussle of the sea-
son to Army, 28-0. Since then they
have folled over Western Reserve, 47-
6 and subdued Holy Cross, 35-28 last
week.

Colgate faces a severe test this
year for the Raiders have not won
more games than they have lost since
the 1943 season when they won five,
lost three, and tied one. Last year
they had their worst season on record.
They won one encounter and dropped
the other eight However, Obvlgate
plays a pretty tough schedule each
year. They face teams like Prince-
ton, Cornell, Syracuse, Holy Cross,
Rutgers, and this year, Army.

ful for his relatively slight frame.
He would probably have a good
chance to be a top All-American ¢an-
didate with a winning football squad.
The tip-off on this statement is that
he has missed only one All-opponent
squad named by Colgate’s 1948 and
1949 foes. Last season he scored 12
touchdowns for 72 points.

With Egler, Totten, and Armand
Allaire at halfback positions, and
sophomore Bob Schirmer at fullback,
the Red Raiders have four speed-boys
who can go all the way if they see

daylight.

Allaire Stars

Allaire, a Worcester Academy pro:
duct who was a Colgate star two
years ago, has come back in this, his
senior year, after a disappointing 1949
showing. In the first two games this
fa)l he has rushed for better than
eight yards per carry on his 17 sorties
with the ball. His 51 yard sprint
against Western Reserve was the
standout of that game.

Up front coach Howard Hartman
has done a fine job in stiffening the
Colgate defense. _Line-backere Bob
McCall and Jerry Madden, end Harry
Wylie, tackle Harry Abeltin, guard
Brud Davis and Co. have been tough
to move against except during the
four long runs which Army used to
beat the Raiders at Michie Stadium
September 30.

Colgate uses the two-platoon sy
tem of operation except’ for Davis,
McCall, and Wylie, who perform a
double duty. Colgate’s offensive line
averages 194 pounds while the back
field averages 17

Bucknell Injured

Bucknell goes into the Colgate
game with two injured players. They
are left end Joe Gallagher and second-
string quarterback Glenn Aspinwall.
Abe Powelson will] replace Gallagher
at left end. In the offensive backfield
Bob Albert will be at fullback and
Dick Hetsko will be at right halfback.

Coach Harry Lawrence of the Herd
said: “Bucknell will be up for this
game. The team is in good spirits
and anxious to go against Colgate.”

“We are hoping for an upset and

if we pull it, it will more than make |

up for the games we lost,” continued
Lawrence.

When asked if the Colgate end
sweeps and runs through the middie
would be troublesome, Coach Lawr-
ence replied: “Colgate has one of the
speediest backfields in the east and
they will be hard to halt around the
ends but they will not run through
our center.”

Try For Upset

In conclusion Lawrence stated: “We !

are concentrating on everything this
week in practice and the boys are
working hard to try and pull that up-
set.”

When pressed further as to details,

His co-worker, Peggy Deardorf,

_ by Bobbie Maurer

One of our most distinguished pro-
fessors here at Bucknell was born
some time ago in Vershire, Vermont.
He moved from place to place during
his childhood, since his father was a
Baptist minister. When he attended
grade school, the teachers declared
him to be a retarded child, and at the
age of fourteen, he left the seventh
grade.

He learned the printer’s trade, and
after five years, returned to high
school to finish it in two years, which
was quite a feat for a so-called retard-
ed boy. This lad went on ta Brown
University, graduated in four years
instead of the usual five, and obtained
his AB and Master's degree. The boy
was none other than our own Doctor

Le Gallienne presented scenes from
Shakeepeare’s “Romeo and Juliet”,
Congreve’s “The Way of the World”,
Goldoni’s “The Mistress of the Inn,”
and Tehekov’s “The Cherry Orchard.”
As a special encore two scenes from
Ibsen's “Ghosts” were given. Miss

A reception following the show was
held for the cast by Mrs. Mary John-

discover if Vixen, one of Miss Le Gal-

haired dog is a true thespian and se!

drum of the Lewisburg band, Vixen
seemed to enjoy Lewisburg very
much.

facturers, “Cordura” was tested in
heavy-duty tires on baking-hot des
ert roads. During the war it proved
itself on command cars, trucks and
jeeps. Today, rayon-cord tires are
widely used on trucks and buses,
and leading manufacturers use
Du Pont “Cordura” in tires they
make for passenger cars.

The combination of lightness and
strength offered by “Cordura” has
also earned it a welcome from makers
of conveyor belts, V-belts and hose
for domestic, agricultural and indus-
trial uses. It is used to reinforce lam-
inated kraft paper, to tie wires to
electrical switchboards and asa chain
warp in carpets to bind the wool
tufts firmly in place. One of the
newest uses is in plastic clotheslines.
The Du Pont Company makes none
of these articles. But because
Du Pont scientists had an idea and
the facilities and funds to develop
it, many businesses can now offer you

have made through the years to the

“Cordura” High Tenacity Rayon

is comparable to structural steel in
tensile strength. It makes possible
tires that are at once lighter, stronger
and safer than pre-war tires. Unlike
natural fibers, the qualities of this
product of chemical science are al-
ways uniform.

UNDIES TO TIRES
At first, rayon was used mainly in
making articles of clothing. However,
with an improved tire cord in mind,
Du Pont scientists set out to produce
a tougher rayon than any previously
known. The problem was given to a

organic, physical and analytical
chemists, physicists, and chemical
and mechanical engineers.

One of their first discoveries was
that strength could be increased by
using cotton linters as the source of
cellulose, in place of wood pulp. It
was found, also; that the viscose solu-
tion had to be prepared and handled
with extreme care. Perhaps the most
important lesson was one which the
silkworm had taught centuries be-
fore: stretching increases strength. The
Du Pont experimenters stretched the
new yarn and made rayon with a ten-
sile strength of about 70,000 pounds
to the square inch—more than twice
the strength of textile rayon then
being produced.

More Furor About The Oath

In last week’s issue we printed a speech by President Hil-
dreth concerning the “furor treated by the oaths of non-commun-
ist afhliation required of faculty members at the University of
California

It was our intention in writing a headline for the story to
give the reader the impression that the speech concerned the issue
of the loyalty oath. .

Our faculty must have taken offense at the story, for we have
been beseiged with tales ¢ ide remarks about our “sensation-
alisr

We apologize for the small machine head near the bottom
of the story: “Fuzzy Faculty”. Nothing was meant by it. We
also apologize for the misleading headline, for it would have

One of our faculty sent a letter to the Editor warning us “to

We dispute that last statement, for the six or seven faculty
members who did refuse to sign the oath, have definitely been ac-

AN HONOR SYSTEM AT BUCKNELL

Last week I challenged the validity of the status of Bucknell University
as a center of “higher learning” on the basis of the lack of personal integrity
and respect for the rights of our fellow man, It io still my firm belief, that
the high degree of cheating in examinations is one of — most flagrant illus.
trations of the inadequacies of Bucknell’s “Way of Life. .

While cheating appears to be one of our “tolerated” folkways, many
schools and colleges have successful honor systems, euch as the University of
Virginia. Before any student enrolls there he has been thoroughly familiar.
ized with the mechanics and purpose of the honor system. He receives liter.
ature before arriving at the University, and during his first week at school he
hears speeches by the most distinguished figures on campus.

He meets in small groups where students have a chance to ask questions
of student leaders and to sign the honor card saying they understand the sys
tem and are willing to abide by it. The questions are of such a nature that
every person understands the system as It is: “A Positive Force Working To
Develop Men Of Integrity And To Bring Freedom From Mistrust To All Of

Jniversity Life.”

» The ea of the honor system lies in the student bedy's knowledge that
it works and the pride that enables it to continue, When a teacher walks into
a classroom to give an exam, he distributes the papers, answers questions con.
cerning their interpretation and then leaves the room. The students may
talk and they may go out to smoke. Nobody feels regimented; nobody is under
the strain of constant fear; nobody is subjected to disturbing influences due
to cheating and “police teachers.”

“The word of a student i
truth.” This word extend: ynd mere
disdainful practices as steal nd g. A

Speaker Explains Larison Dormitory Renovations

FEPC Practices

by Jerry Olds

How would you like to go for a job
you desperately need being the best
qualified candidate; yet, you're atill
turned down? At Sunday night's
Student Church Dr. Frank F. Simp-
son blasted unfair employment in
simple but no uncertain terms,

Speaking extemperoneously, Dr,

Simpson explained how the Fair Em. i

ployment Practices Commission is
working in the six states and two
cities where it has already been es-
tablished, “Democracy,” declared Dr,
Simpson, “can work if people are in-
terested in seeing that it works.”

Dr. Simpson used the Conn. Draper |:

case, one of 500 complaints, as an
example of the several steps involved
when the commission prosecutes a
case. When a complaint (which can
be filed by anyone) is made, a field

By Homecoming; Changes Noted

by Jackie Long

Larison Hall expects to make its debut as a refinished dormitory this
weekend. For the past months everything and everybody has been in a con-
fused muddle but if the plans go through as scheduled, the unveiling of a re-
built center section, mainly first and second floors, will end all this confusion

and headaches.

Prof. William Johnson

by Bobbie Maurer
Undoubtedly, many of you have no-
ticed the pretty little house surround-
ed by beautiful grounds on University
Avenue next to the Kappa Sig house
its owner is Assistant Professor of
History William Johnson, who has,
over a period of twenty years, worked
on its landscaping as a hobby.
When in graduate school, he began
a collection of antiques and has con-
tinued, not only for the sake of col-
lecting, but because many of these
possessions have historical signifi-
cance. He is always searching for a
treasure in an unexpected place. In
fact, in a rural Pennsylvania village,
he found a Sevres porcelain vase,
made in 1763 under the auspices of
Louis XIV of France. It was hidden
under a coat of cheap gilt.
Enjoys Painting Designs
Recently Professor Johnson has
been trying the art of painting in
Pennsylvania Dutch fashion, creating
his own design. Strangely enough,
he haa coliected some designs from
home made tombstones dated as early
as 1730.
This section of Pennsylvania has
alway been Professor Johnson’s
home. Born in Montandon village, he
attended the Sunbury High School.
Though he graduated as saludatorian,
a small fraction below the valedictor
ian because of a Jow mark in deport
he feels much more fortunate
the dictorian is now an old

Graduated Summa Cum Laude

F 1918, he ended

COUNCIL DISCUSSES REGISTRATION TALK;
INVITES GROUPS TO HELP GET FILM

by Frank Kelly

The Engineering Council held its
opening meeting last Thursday. It
opened with a discussion of John
T. West's talk on registration as a
professional engineer. A tentative
agreement that such a talk should be
planned as an annual event was reach-
ed, Following this, the subject of a
recent film,’“‘Atomic Physics”, was

Flintroduced. Because of the relatively

large fee attached with the film, it
was agreed that other societies than
those connected with engineering
should be invited to jointly procure
the film. A few of the societies men-
tioned were those connected with phy-
sics, mathematics and chemistry.
Suggests Bulletin Board

Dr. Griffith, one of the faculty ad-
visors for the Council, suggested that
the Council sponsor a bulletin board
for the lobby of the engineering
building. This board would be for
the use of the various engineering
societies, and would serve as a perm.
anent poster for their activities.

The next meeting of the Counci! is
scheduled for November 9th at 4:30 in
the afternoon in E103.

The ASME has its next meeting
tentatively scheduled for November 2

to have Professor Doggett of the EE
Department as their speaker.

The ASCE will hold its next meet-
ing on Friday, October 27, at 3:80.
The CE’s magazine, “On the Level”,
will be out sometime near the end of
this month. A few other high spots
in the CE calendar are the presenta.
tion of papers by various students on
jobs which they have held, a movie
on the Pan-American Highway on No-
vember 16, and a banquet which is
tentatively scheduled for December
16.

“Hames” To Meet

The “Ham” Radio Club will be Hold.
ing its next meeting on November 1
at 7 p. m. in E306.

Several members of the faculty re«
ceived an invitation to see the Gen-
eral Electric “More Power to America
Special” which was on display in Hare
risburg last Tuesday. It is a train
made up of several cars which con-
tain many of the new developments in
electrical engineering. It was unfor-
tunate that the display was limited to
those receiving invitations, because its
contents would have been of great in-
terest to all the engineers on campus.

Moberly Divisions Meet;
Discuss Application Of

‘Crisis In The University’

Last week three divisions of the
Moberly Study; Humanities, Com
merce and Finance and Language,
gathered to probe further into Sir
Walter Moberly’s book, “The Crisi:
in the University

The small, informal groups of stu-
dents and facuity all met to acquaint
themselves further with this much-
talked,of book and to discuss its ap-
flication to our own university.

The discussion of the Humanities
Division, led by Dr. Harriman and
Jane Gale, was primarily concerned
with the changing conceptions of the
university’s tasks The importance
of community life in a college or
university was observed.

The students expressed their belief
that a university should endeavor to
bring about the establishment of a
collegiate community to further the
socio-educational aspects of a well

| knit group. This type of group life

also allows the invaluable interchange
of ideas, which forward the achieve-
ment of a liberal education

mg time since I haunted you. They thought
that the end of my reign had passed when I died in the Spring of
1947. True, I hadn’t given you too much trouble in the last few
year Maybe that’s why I passed away

But my spirit didn’t die with me. It took a lot of revival on
the part of the school, but the “Spirit” came back.

The students were a little shaky when I arrived at noon,
Homecoming Day. They didn’t yell much during the Lafayette
game, but last week they blew their lids for me. And this week
they’ ming along with me to let you hear for yourselves how
they support me

There was a time that you shuddered when you knew I was
coming to Philadelphia. I aim to start you thinking about me
again. I’m out to clip your wings this Saturday, Owl, so watch
out!

beyond any doubt that no such problem will exist, if, in fact, it ever did.

He explained that engineering graduates of the past year, despite pessi-

mistic pre-graduation predictions, had been placed as quickly as those of any
previous class and that starting salaries had slightly exceeded those of pre-
vious years.

IFC Will Sponsor
Post-Exam Jubilee,
Plans Underway

The Interfraternity Council will
sponsor a Post-Exam Jubilee on Feb-
ruary 23, \t was decided last Monday
evening at the I. F. C. meeting in the
Kappa Sigma House.

Reg Hubley, chairman of the jubilee
committee, reported that arrange-
ments are now underway to hold the
jubilee. The fraternities will partici-
pate in a program to be announced
later.

Plans to hold the piedge banquet
which had been postponed were dis-
cussed and it was decided to attempt
the banquet next Wednésday. Pledges
from each house will be invited to
attend in an effort to establish a
closer spirit of friendship between
the fraternities.

The council] endorsed a proposal
that the I. F. C. submit a letter to the
Student-Faculty Congress suggesting
that more rigorous freshman hazing
be effected next year. The council!
asked specifically that freshmen wear
name signs until rushing week.

L F. C. formally went on record as
favoring the proposal made by 8. F.
C. that students sit in a body at all
home football games.

Jack Swanson, Phi Kappa Psi, and
Larry Bloom, Sigma Alpha Mu, were
authorized as official I. F. C. delegates
to the convention to be held over the
Thanksgiving holidays in New York
City.

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY, LEWISBURG, PENNA.

Campus Quizzer

Elaine Vouyoukas

For this week, the topic under dis-
cussion was: Do you think students
should be allowed to take as many
cuts as they want?

This could be and was a decided
battle between a well known disputer
of law and order at Bucknéll and a
member of the faculty. But ail’s
well that ends well (or did it?) Or
shall we just say the impartial judges
for this week's decision could not de-
cide and called it a tie?

I first had to choose a member of
the faculty who would give a pretty
accurate answer for all the faculty.
A brilliant thought, (rare but it does
happen), hit my head. Miss Necci!
Her answer was typical, to say the
least.

“NO!” “If it were left up to the
students discretion, I’m afraid we
wouldn't have any students left in
class. Probably have to post advance
notices of class meetings.” True.
True.

It was then suggested I get a typi-
cal student’s reaction to this question.
I picked Dick Lang, more commonly
known around campus as “College
Joe. His opinion was, “Absolutely,
if they can get the stuff—no use
comin’ every day.’ If you would
care to inquire further on Dick’s|
theories on th ubject, you may find
him at 10 o’clock every Mon., Wed.,
and Fri. at the Bisor upposedly he
has Lat ass at that atrocious hour
but being tudent, he

Campus Interviews on Cigarette ‘Tests
Number 5... THE GNU

“T gnu the answers...but I wasn’t talking!’’

Tre debating team couldn’t make much use of this
non-talkative baby... but one look at his “literary leanings” tells you
that tests don’t buffalo him. *Specially those tricky cigarette tests! As a
smoker, you probably know, too, that one puff or one sniff—
or a mere one-inhale comparison can’t prove very much
about a cigarette!
Why not make the sensible test—the 30-Day Camel
Mildnees Test. You judge Camel mildness and flavor
in your own “T-Zone” (T for Throat, T for Taste)
eee for 30 days. Yes, test Camels as a steady

smoke and you'll see why...

More People Smoke Camels
than any other cigarette!

VILLAGE VOICE...

(Continued from —n" 7)

in September of ’47, an apartment at
the College Inn was their first home;
they've been villagers sinco February
of °49. While Don has been taking
care of Cost and Tax Accounting in
‘preparation to receiving his B. 8. in
C & F in February, Martha has been
sharing devotedly the financial re-
sponsibilities by working for various
University departments Curfently
you'll find her handling the clerical
work of Professors Brand, Britton,
and Burns in the Botany Building.

And how did their romance begin?
Well, back about 1938 two 8th grad-
ers began smiling shyly across the
room at each other Then in high
school came the “note-passing stage”
when Martha passed the notes, made
the dates, and Don broke them just
as fast as they were made. “He just
never showed up!” explained Martha.
Tired of such shenanigans, Martha
wasn't sure she wanted unreliable Don
as a permanent partner But by
their graduation in May, 1944, Don
had things well under control. “He
had become star halfback and captain
of the football team which,” laughed
Martha, “left no doubt in my mind
about who my husband was going tc
be.”

THE BUCKNELLIAN

Voice received a well-written letter yesterday
from Harry R. Garvin, President of the Bucknell Chapter of the
American As \ { University Professors

The letter made us blush! It concerned a front-page “box”
last week relating how one of our “cub” reporters was informed
by ballot that his presence as a reporter was not desired at an
open meeting of the AAUP.

Professor Garvin’s letter let us know that 1. It was not the
faculty, but the AAUP which was meeting, 2. The meeting was
ne pen” in the sense that the press was invited, and 3. The
meeting was highlighted by an informal chat with President Hil-
dreth on University matters ;

We apologize for misleading our readers. Our story omit-
ted some of the facts and we did make an error, (we reported the
meeting at Social Science Building instead of Hunt Recreation
Room).

We might apologize and let the matter drop. However, we
do think that the affair sheds some unfavorable light on student
faculty relations

In the first place, the students who heard about the incident
were too quick to jump to conclusions. Also, the faculty was
too quick to resent the fact that students wanted to know what
the “off the record” discussion concerned.

‘SS
Hartford, Conn.—(I. P.)—The probability of “eonvulsive changes” for
Trinity College caused by the Korean war ore foreseen by President G. =
' Funston in his annual report, pablished recently. President Funston reiter-

Fated his belief that “the nation must introduce a program of universal military

| training before {t will be adequately prepared.”
He also reported that the academic work of students on this campus rose
'} to the highest level on record in 1949-50 and that academic mortality was re-
duced. The all-college average increased from 75.9 to 77-41, exceeding the
previous all-time high of 76.6 achieved in 1946-47 at the peak of veteran en-
rollment. Only 10 men were required to withdraw from college in 1950 as
| compared with 24 in 1949 and 42 in 1948, he added.
. Especially notable, President Funston snid, was the fact that for thw firat
| time on record the average of all fraternity men was better than that of non-
| fraternity men. Gratifying also was the improvement in the freshman aver-
| age from 73.6 to 75.1. Fifteen pereent of the student body had a Dean's list
_ | average of eighty-five and only tem percent failed in one or more of their five
| courses,

“Major factor’ in the improved scholastic results, he pointed out, was
adoption of delayed rushing until the sophomore year by fraternities. A more
strict academic qualification for pledgmg resulted in only three freshmen
| forced to withdraw in June, and only five on probation—figures without prece+

Carbondale, IIL—(I. P.) — The achievements of the Student Council at
Southern [llinois University are already outstanding, and if the present trend
continues, the council will undoubtedly rank among the most efficient ever re-
f\ corded. .

7 Thus far the present Student Council has beew instrumental in starting

a system whereby the student may buy a $7.50 meal ticket at the student cafe-
® teria for only 85. In conjunction with the Dean of Men's office, they have
-' sponsored an informative discussional meeting presided over by representa-
; tives of the armed forces, The meeting was held to give as much information

| os possible to students of draft age.

1 Other plans of the Student Council include a Career Canference to be held
| February 7 and 8, At this conference, key figures in. various industries and
i professions will present facts concerning job opportunities in each field of en-

deavor.

The third annual Burma-Bucknell weekend was hailed as another
step on the road to world understanding by the eighteen guests of the

ission.

© Last weekend’s busy two-day con-
ference included a trip to the Fed-
era! Penitentiary, a banquet, a Round
Table on Building Bridges between
the East and West, sightseeng tours
and informal talks between the Bur-
mest guests and students and faculty.

Speaking at the banquet Saturday
night, Dean William H. Coleman
urged those present to build “bridges
of understanding” between ali the
peoples of the East and West

USA Sincere

Another speaker at the dinner held
in the Women’s Dining Hal! was Dr.
Lo Kay, president of University Col-
lege, Mandalay, who said that the
Burmese government is convinced of
America’s sincerity and support ia
case of a crisis with Red China.

In the main address of the evening,
Oliver J. Caldwell of the State De-
partment challenged the faculty to
educate students to be world citizens.

"and “dishonesty°—but are we children?

Another argument immediately comes to your mind, namelty—If a profes
ves a test I feel is totally unfair, who can blar e if I cheat? Did you
examine yourself to find out if y Perhaps you only
vudied an hour—what do you expect, a miracle? What would you think if
the professors agreed to put samples of their tests on file in the ibrary so

that ali students could know what type of quest would be asked and what
material would be stressed? They do it at Harvard, so it's possible to do it

her

Maybe you've rationalized about cheating with this argument — imployers
look at grades, so I have to get them somehow. But—employers also study
character references very carefully. Professors who will write those refer-
ences know who does their own work and who depends on someone else to do
hia studying for him. An employer doesn’t want an employee whose honesty
is questionable or who trys to get by with a bare minimum of the work requir-
ed Another aspect to be considered is that if an employer knows that you
come from a school which has a Scholastic Honor System, he can be almost
positive that the grades you obtained are an indication of your own ability, and
that the qualities of a sense of responsibility and honesty are ingrained in your
character.

Mortar Board and ODK feel that the Scholastic Honor System should and

can be a part of our Bucknell Way of Life. Consequently, we are 100% b
hind the committee of a few interested students and faculty members who or:
ganized about a year ago to investigate the possibilities of setting up an Honor
System ‘at Bucknell.

| We also feel that the students should know what has already been done

| toward the program. At least one professor in each department has promised
to try out the Honor System in his tesis and report the results. In addition,

‘ the administration has promised to back the system whole-heartedly if indica-

‘tion is shown that the students themselves are ready and willing to accept the

| system.

Questionnaires are being sent to various colleges in an effort to assimilate
the necessary information so that different systems can be compared and @
program set up suitable to the size of Bucknell.

We would appreciate it if all of you weuld help us in your bull sesstens in
the dorms and houses to get the opinions of many people and also to spread
the word around to other students. A public forum will be held in Student
Church on November 19 when all those interested are requested te come and
voice their opinions, good or bad.

We also hope that this letter has aroused your thinking to such an extent
that you will reply in future letters giving your comments about the possibility
of installing the system. In this way we can get a sampling of the Voice of
the Students, which first, last, and always will determine whether the Scho-
lastic Honor System at Bueknell will succeed or fail.

Sincerely,

Mortar Board and Omicron Delta Kappa

THE PHILADELPHIA STORY

by Will Jackson

It all happened on Armistice Day, 1960!

Our story begins in the upper left hand corner. A packed root
ing section of Bucknellians awaited the start of the Old Shoe Trophy
classic in Temple Stadium. Some of them were smiling confidently
some wer getting restless, some were looking passively over at the
Te mple stands, some were just looking around.

To the right, the Bison Band solemnly paraded through the
streets of North Philadelphia. Their step was short and curt. They
weren't the kind to celebrate before the final score shone on the elec
tric scoreboard. They remembered their half-time enthusiasm last
year, and how they left Temple Stadium with a feeling of frustration

Now the whistle blew. Ina matter of minutes everyone in the
stadium knew that the Thundering Herd was on the march They
knew that this year would be different, that the Bisons were out for
blood. Even the cheerleaders added more jest to their leaps in the
air. The spirit was there

Below, on the right, an over-confident Temple fraternity drove
its Homecoming Float around the city campus. They were so sur‘
that the Big City Boys were going to win that they didn’t bother
co over to the stadiurn They were too interested watching their
friends ‘Freeze Them Out’ Little did they know!

The ame was hard. But the Bisons were harde: Che jubilant
fans, below left, were out on the field tearing down the goal posts be
fore the al whistle had blown. Th wasn't much the bewilder
Templars could do about it either. A few of them half-heartedly ran
over to the scene of the crime and started tugging away against the
“civilian” Herd. Their efforts were as successful as w their bit
brothers on the gridiron.

men who tore down the posts were a study in psychology.

tige the determined look on some faces, the scorn on others, the

happy amiles on more, and the proud look on the two “Guards”. And
each had an arm securely wrapped around the symbolic wood.

When Bison fans returned home they passed the familiar store
on the left. The score was there, on top, and it looked good. It was
a real victory, and those who saw it knew that twenty year om now
they would be telling it to the awed, young Bucknellians gathered
around them at Homecoming, 1970.

Oriental Culture
Course Combines
History, Religion

The idea of an integrated course
entitled “Oriental Culture” was sug-
gested by a statement made by Mr.
Oliver Caldwell, U. 8 Department of
State, at the banquet of the Burma-
Bucknell Conference He said that
any American citizen who considers
himself educated would have to know
a great deal about the thought and
the culture of the Orient For in-
stance, no one can deal satisfactorily
with the people of the Orient unless
they know the essential ideas and
practices of Buddhism.

A group of the members of the
Bucknell faculty, realizing that there
are already in the curriculum several
courses dealing with the Orient in
more or less fragmentary ways, have
considered the idea that it would be
possible to poll these courses and help
students to develop a much more in-
tegrated picture of Oriental civiliza-
tion.

An experimental course in integrat-
ed education is offered during the
second semester. This is a course in
Oriental Civilization. It wiil comprise
a rapid survey of the cultural develop-
ment of China and India and a more
detailed study of the modern period of
Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and Bur-
mese culture. .

Students should register for History
234, Religion 200, or Religion 217.
Dr. Karraker, Dr. Wethington, and
Dr. Bond are offering these courser
which will be lecture and discussion

Virginia O'Hanlon
“115 West Ninety-fifth Street.”

Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the
skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they see. They
think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds.
All minds, Virginia, whether they be men’s or children’s, are little.

In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect,
as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelli-
gence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.

Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and
generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to
your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world
if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if there were no
Virginias.

There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make
tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and
sight. The eternal light with which childhood fille the world would be ex-
einguished,

Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies!
You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christ-
mas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming
down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign
that there is no Santa Claus.

The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men
can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but
that’s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all
| the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.

You tear apart the baby’s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but
there ia a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, hor
even the united strength of all the strongest men that over lived, could tear
apart.

Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and
view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah,
Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.

No Santa Claus! Thank God he lives, and he lives forever~ A thousand
years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times he w il continue to make glad the
heart of childhood.

he did not speak unsympathetically,

He pointed out to those subject to

Last weekend a group of fellow students from Howard Uni-
versity visited the campus and gave a fine presentation of ‘The
Government Inspector” on the stage of the Lewisburg High
School.

The appearance of the Howard Players was sponsored by
the local chapter of the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People. They were given a warm reception by
the student body, particularly by the so-called “discriminatory”
fraternities of Bucknell.

Fraternities have been subject to a good deal of attack in the
last few years. They have been charged with discriminating
against fellow students on the basis of color, religion, and race.
But yet it is these fraternities that consistently act as hosts to
members of various minority groups when they visit the school.

An after-hours party at one of the bigger houses found white
and colored students associating together. Some day “mixed”
parties may be accepted by the majority of Americans. As things
stand now, however, it is the “discriminatory” fraternities that
are leading the way.

The term discrimination can be found in leading dictionaries.
The “American College Dictionary” defines it as—the making of
a difference in particular cases, as in favor or against a person or
thing. Webster says discrimination is “observing or marking a
difference ~y

If those definitions are accurate, then no fraternities at Buck-
nell actively discriminate as to whom they will associate with or
entertain in their homes. That is certainly more than you can
say for the majority of American families.

When it comes to picking fraternity brothers, however,
many of the campus fraternities do discriminate. They have a
device called the blackball, in common with many other national

rganizations. The blackball is used to decide who is to enter
the group

Whether or not there is a clause in a fraternity Stating re-
quirements for membership, that blackball is still there. It’s use
cannot be justified morally. But it does give men the power to
choose people to live with ,

Many of us have racial prejudice. We cannot justify that

Fraternities were formed by men who wanted to live to-

a group. But why should people try to tell the group how they
are to pick members?

To the Editor:

I think I have finally discovered
what is meant by “the Bucknell way
of life.” It ean be summed up in one
word: Conformity. To be a “true”
Bucknellian, one must conform to the
pattern of life on campus. Any devi-
ation from this pattern is frowned
upon. Bucknell’s Beatitudes might
go something like this:

Blessed are those who don't study
any more than necessary, for
they shall be happy-go-lucky.

Blessed are those who don’t bother
to think, for it is easier to mem-
orize.

Blessed are those who won't asso-
ciate with anyone “queer” or
“radical”, for they shall have
their cliques.

Blessed are those who have no con-
victions, for they shall be easily
swayed.

Blessed are those who are not con-
cerned about campus and world
issues, for they shall be “happily”
complacent.

Blessed are those who are “practi-
cal” and realize the necessity for
compromising their ideals, for
they shall know the meaning of
“expediency”,

Blessed are those who conform for
popularity’s sake, for they shall
be in the majority.

Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for
you shall be “well adjusted” at
Bucknell.

Yes, conform to the Bucknell way
lof life and you'll get along better.
It’s easier. But there are a few
people on campus who prefer to think,
jto be concerned, to have convictions,
jto be different. There are a few
| people who won't let the world around
; them squeeze them into its own mold.
But what about the majority? Are
| wo satisfied with the “Bucknell way
of life” as it is? Are we ever going
; to stop conforming and start being
individuals ? Are we ever going to
| Start thinking for ourselves?

Are we going to stop bowing down
o the great god ( mnformity and start

_ Letters to the Editor

December 6, 1950
To the Editor:

Some time ago I wrote a letter to
your department renouncing Presi-
dent Hildreth’s negativistic attitude
towards scholastic scholarships as be-
ing shallow and contrary to the more
progressive educational ideas,

Since that letter was never publish-
ed, I must conclude that your office is
either outstanding in its clerical in-
competency or you have not the
“guts” to print a letter opposing the
University’s policies,

Although the issue is not a new one,
being presented in Mr. Hildreth’s in-
augural address, it’s controversial
character gives it enough significance
to be included in the letters to the
editors department.

I find it superfluous to rehash the
reasons for my opposition to this im-
portant administrative policy, but
having observed that the relatively
unimportant athletic scholarships are
readily dispensed, my indignation re-
sulting from the lack of scholastic
scholarships is increased, and I de-
mand either a flat denial of my ac-
cusations, based on factual evidence,
or an apology for not printing my
previous letter.

Thank you,
Alan Schwarz

Ed. Note: Previous letter was not
printed because the writer’s extreme-
ly “hazy” indictment was too lengthy
for publication.

To sophomore Schwarz we say that
“freedom of the press” includes the
right to edit letters or file them, ‘till
the writer has had more time to in-
vestigate more closely into the mat-
ter of his complaint.

Since our indignant soph now con-
siders it “superfluous to rehash his
reasons”, we consider it superfluous
to say any more.

a
more purposeful lives? A totalitar-
ian government forces its citizens to
conform. Our country stands for
freedom—yet we choose to conform
Something is wrong somewhere!
Sincerely,
Dotty Clark

National Teachers Exams
To Be Given In Lewisburg

°

Lewisburg has been designated as
a testing center for the 1951 nation-
wide administration of the National
Teacher Examinations next February,
Dr. W. H. Sauvain, Professor of Edu-
cation has announced.

College seniors preparing to teach
and teachers applying for positions in
school systems which encourage or
require applicants to submit their
scores on the National Teacher Exam-
inations along with their other cre-
dentials are eligible to take the tests.
The examinations are prepared and
administered annually by Educational
Testing Service, Princeton, N. J.

The designation of Lewisburg as a
testing center for these examinations
will give prospective teachers in this
area an opportunity to compare their
performance on the examinations with
approximately 10,000 candidates
throughout the country who will be
participating in the nationwide ad-
ministration on February 17, 1951,
Dr. Sauvain said.

At the one-day testing session a
candidate may take the common ex-
aminations, which include tests in
professional information, general cul-
ture, English expression, and non-
verbal reasoning. In addition, each
candidate may take one or two of the
nine optional examinations which are
designed to demonstrate mastery of
subject matter in the fields in which
he may be assigned to teach.

Applications for the examinations
and a Bulletin of Information des
cribing registration procedures and
containing sample test questions may
be obtained from Dr. Sauvain or di
rectly from the National Teacher Ex-
aminations, Educational Testing Ser-
vice, P. O. Box 592, Princeton, N. J.
Prospective teachers planning to take
the test should secure an Application
and a Bulletin of Information prompt

ly, Dr. Sauvain advised.

FLANAGAN FEATURED
AT THE MEADOWBROOK
FOR ‘BUCKNELL NIGHT’

by Bill Fullmer

Ralph Flanagan and his orchestra
will be the feature attraction when
Bucknellians meet at the Meadow-
brook in New Jersey on December 28
to celebrate the annual “Bucknell
Night”.

The Meadowbrook management has
spared no expense, time or effort to
assure its Bucknell guests a pleasant
evening. In addition to the dance
music for which the orchestra has
become famous, the “Flanagan Flair”
will be applied to the Alma Mater in
honor of the University,

As in the past, Bucknelliang wil!
have a special section, reserved ex-
clusively for them. But this year as
a further convenience, reservations
may be made to accommodate indi-
vidual fraternity groups within the
Bucknell section, Reservations may
be made by contacting Meadowbrook
directly or by calling this author at
the Sigma Chi house.

Flanagan is the band leader who
signed for a Broadway theater ap-
pearance even before he had an or-
chestra. When he opened at the
Capitol Theatre in New York last July,
Ralph asked producer Alan Zee why
he had booked his group when he had
not seen him, and knew he did not
have an organized band. “I didn’t
have to see a thing,” Zee re plied. “I
just heard your recordings and watch
ed the sales figures.” that

Bisons Will Tackle Rhode Island State Here Saturday After Two Ivy-League Losses

by Harvey Sheirr

The Bison courtmen will return to
Davis Gym after three games on the
road to face the Rhode Island State
Rams this Saturday night in the
Herd’s second home contest of the
young campaign. The Guymen hope
to avenge last year’s 88-78 defeat at
the hands of the Rhodies.

Coach Robert (Red) Haire has al-
most a complete rebuilding job facing
him this season at Rhode Island
State. Six of his first eight men from
last year have gone their ways via
graduation. Only top-flighters on
hand are two 5-8 boys, Johnny Mit-
chell and Chuck Stewart

These two are of better than fair
ability. They are assets to almost
any team and are a good nucleus at
guards. Should Haire’s sophomores
mold with these boys, the Rhodies
could post an acceptable record. The
sophs are bigger than the Rams aver
age. John Helmus, Bill Marino, Fred
Lennen, and Rollie Kubitsky are
around 6-3.

Mitchell and Stewart move fast,
are good shots and very tricky. Ex
citing to watch, they will carry the
sophs to a certain extent.

December 26 the Rams faced Seton
Hal! in a game which marked the
debut of the 1950-51 basketball cam-

The Princeton Tigers, Ivy League

minute battle

Fresh from a twelve point defeat

the players concerning the game be-
tween the Local Frosh and the Sus-
quehanna Yearlings, played Tuesday
night on the opponents’ floor to the
tune of 71-35.

As was the case last year, the Cru-
saders were no match for the local
talent, as the BU boys poured it on.
After a tight first period, the Bisons
got hot and never colled off. The
scoreboard read at halftime: Bucknell

story nn the second half as Hank

' HERD’S SCORING COMPARES FAVORABLY TO LAST YEAR'S

If past performances are any measure, this year’s courimen are
well on their way to repeating last season's point-getting performances.

After three games last December the Herd had tallied only 177
points as compared to 210 at the three-game mark this year. Highmen
Gallagher and Strassner had 46 and 34 points last year but have racked
up 65 and 52 points respectively this year after three games.

none of this when they take the court

ing played in the small schools.

We know of a guy, Clark Hinkle, who, when they were passing out these
wonderful honors, got the usual “perfunetory bow and cursory nod.” He: was
highest scoring back in the nation in his sophomore year, led Bucknell to the

More Organization Needed
Ironically enough the girls have

shown more enthusiasm for volleybal
this year than any other sport so far,

: and yet interclass practices were for |?
ij the most part disorganized. So many

girls were out in afternoon practices
that frequently five or six were in
each side of the net that very little
practice was obtained by any individ
ual.

Some faculty member (like we had
at hockey practices) or some leader
was definitely needed who would have
allowed for the extra people by di
viding them all into several teams
whereby everyone would have had at
least some valuable practice. Let’
hope the spirit and enthusiasm fox

this lack of foresight

Inspecsion Tours And Banquets

by Frank Kelly

The festive and holiday atmosphere
which normally ladens the campus air
during the vacation season of Novem-
ber and December has even permeated
the rigorous confines of the Engineer-
ing Building. The ChEs and the MEs
have had their annual banquets and
completed their week-long inspection
trips; the EEs took an all-day sojourn
to Bethlehem, Pa., on the 12th; and
the CEs have their yearly feast this
Friday.

The speaker at the annual ASCE
Student Banquet wil be W. W. Port-
ser, a member of the first Civil Engi-
neering graduating class from Buck-
nell in 1905. He is a retired engi-
neer, formerly employed by the
Pennsylvania Railroad. The banquet
will be held on December 15 in the
4th Street Evangelical Church.

At the last meeting of the ASCE,
Messrs M. Bender and W. Cozzins of
the Portiand Cement Association
spoke on the function of the Portland
Cement Association and the oppor-
tunities for CEs in the Agsociation.

Professor Kindig, of the CE De
partment, attended the convention of

the Society for Experimental Street
Analysis in New York City from No-
vember 29 to December 1. A new
slant on the Society's meeting was
the exhibit which showed the modern
methods of stress analysis, in conjunc-
tion with the technical sessions and
conferences, The field of stress an-
alysis is becoming such an increasing-
ly important subject in all phases of
production and construction that the
not-too-distant future should. show
practically all engineering design be-
ing based on stress analysis results
rather than empirical formulae now
in use. A study of this subject should
make an interesting, as well as prac-
tical, subject for all engineering stu-

Dr. Cooper has announced a new
Chem E course in technical report
writing (ChE 221). It will consist of
lectures by outside editors, as well as
written reports by the students. Al-
though it is a little late for registra-
tion, I believe that anyone who is in-
terested could make the necessary
changes. The course is listed in the
Spring Semester, class schedule.

At the last meeting of the AIEE
on December 6, Professor William
Ginsburg, of the Chemistry Depart-
ment, spoke on the use of magnetic
flux in measuring atomic structure
The AIEE is still conducting a mem
bership drive for under-classmen.
Having a larger membership and in
creased interest in the organization
will mean more and varied activities

Santa Claus will arrive for the Vil-
lage shortly after 5:30 this Sunday
evening at the American Legion
Home. If the interest that has al-

ready been stirred up is any indication,

of the outeome of our Christmas par-
ty, no Villager ean afford not to be
there. This is a party sponsored for
the children, of course, but all adults
are expected to be there and will
probably have as much, if not more
fun than the kids! Here’s just a
sample of the Village talent that will
be used:

Joe Gobbo on accordian; Frank
Hoffman with guitar and folk songs;
Esther Evans on piano; Ray Malinow-
ski to lead the singing of Christmas
carols; yours truly has been asked to
tell the children of the beginning of
the Christian Christmas—about the
birth of the Christ Child and the giv-
ing of the first gifts.

This is one of the big events of the
year, fellow-villagers, #0 see you
there.

Ray and Phyllis Malinowski last
week joined the Village’s “Select
Family Circle.” And what are the
qualifications for this special group?
Just three children is all. The birth

of 8-lb. Blaine Martin on December 3 :
qualified the Malinowski’s to share}:

Music Program

Do you have trouble getting up for
that 8 o'clock? Do you get that
“grumpy-grouchy” feeling when you
fall out of the top bunk? If so,
WVBU has solved your problem, for
at the ungodly hour of 7 a m. every
Monday through Friday the sleepy
voice of some unfortunate character
will pierce through the air with a
cheerful, “Good Morning, Kiddies—
How about some ‘Jam for Break-
fast’?” More or less mechanically,
the voice will then jockey the dises;
announce the events for the dawning
day; chatter idly about who knows
what; inform you that your 8 o’clock
has begun; and even, to save you the
trouble of looking out the window,
forecast the weather. All this goes
on for two solid hours. By nine
o'clock you should be awake, alive,
and ready to tackle the day.

“Jam for Breakfast” was originat-
ed by WVBU two years ago, and be-
came extremely popular. Later, it
was discontinued. On November 29,
the WVBU Board of Directors voted
to revivie the program, and plans
were completed at the Directors’
meeting last Wednesday.

In an attempt to improve its pro-
grams, WVBU is welcoming any criti-
;cisms, favorable or otherwise. Babs
Fiedler, Public Relations Director, re-
cently conducted a poll among the co-
eds of Bucknell. Three main opin-
| ions arose from the poll: l—everyone
was enthusiastic about the broadcast-
ing of away football and basketball
games; 2—the students see the need
for a program list containing the
names of the participants in the
shows; 3—complaints arose over thx
ad libbing on the “Bitter End’ pro
gram A poll of the men’s view is

to be taken soon

of Bucknell announced that 25 new

; Santa Claus should really be proud of Bucknell, for its students have found
time between themes, reports and tests to fully participate in the Christmas
season. Not only have they planned parties, banquets and balls, but they have
also found time to bring happiness to those less fortunate than they and to
observe the true meaning to Christmas—the coming of the Christ Child.

To Present “The Messiah”

Buckneil’s annual presentation of
“The Messiah” will be rendered Sun-
day at 8:15 in the Davis Gymnasium.
Singers from the school, Lewisburg
and Washington will participate. This
traditional oratorio fully brings to
the students the religious significance
of Christmas.

Christmas has always been a sea-
son of giving. The fraternities and
sororities of the University have cap-
tured this spirit with full force.
Each year a fraternity and sorority
combine for a Christmas party for
underprivileged children. Each pair
of fellows and girls “adopt” a child
for the day. They select a gift for
the child and see that he gets to and
from the Christmas party held at the
fraternity house. Santa Claus is the
guest of honor at these parties, and
he sees to it that each child gets his
gift and has a wonderful time

Holiday Spirit

The women’s dormitories have fully
entered into the holiday spirit with
their plans for Christmas parties ard
the decorations of their dorms. Har-
ris Hall is awarding a prize for the
best-trimmed individual door, As you
go up and down the halls, you can
see many different and original decor
ations. At the Language houses, the
Christmas season is celet ated in th

of the season.

So Christmas has come to Bucknell
and has been received wholeheartedly
in a spirit of faith, celebration and
giving. Yes, Santa Claus should
really be proud of Bucknell.

Opportunity will be knocking for
the Bisons when they travel to New
Brunswick, N. J., to tangle with the
Rutgers Queensmen Saturday night.

The Herd encounters Rutgers only
once this season with a chance to
avenge the 88-63 shellacking the
Queensmen dealt them last season.

Rutgers doesn’t look forward to

much this season with four starters

everybody had a good time! Yes, the
Village’s Christmas party was a big
success. And much of the credit goes
to the American Legion for allowi

a good idea into a happy reality were:

THURSDAY, JANUARY 18, 1951.

Enlist Or Be Drafted?

With the war in Korea and the inclinations of different draft
boards supplanting dating and intramurals as the usual topics of
conversation around campus, it is apparent that we at Bucknell
can no longer pay only passing attention to the world situation.

A New York newspaper a few years ago dealt with a similar
situation by telling the story of St. Francis of Assisi, who was
hoeing in his garden one day when a friend approached and asked
what he would do if he were to suddenly learn that he was to die
at sunset. Scarcely stopping to look up, he answered, “I would
finish hoeing my garden.”

What the story points out, of course, is that things must be
kept in their proper perspective. But the increasing number of
empty seats in the classrooms indicates that we at Bucknell are
doing anything but that. Supposedly level headed students are
panicing in the face of social change, turning their backs on a col-
lege education, and racing in cars to Williamsport and the rela-
tive security of a Navy, Army, or Air Force enlistment. Whether
this is an overt act of spontaneous patriotism or a desire to avoid
being drafted into the infantry remains a moot question, the point
being that we're sure this is just what a Joe named Stalin would
want.

So what would Uncle Sam want, you ask. He’s a little slow
about things like this, but when he gets squared away he usually
comes up with something like: “Stay in school.. Men with edu-
cation will be needed, and if I want you in the meantime I’ll let
you know.” Just last week legislation to extend the Holloway
plan ( a program of continued college education for men expect-
ing to be called into the service whereby they would be trained
for one of the three branches) was put before Congress by Sena-
tor Richard B. Russell of the Armed Services Committee. And
this on the heels of President Hildreth’s announcement of the
forming of a R. 0. T. C. unit on campus next Fall.

In the meantime there’s plenty to be done. There’s that book
‘to be read, that meeting to attend, that exam to be taken.

We must go on hoeing our garden. (Fy gi oF

The Scarlett Letter--F!

This is the time of year when the students at Bucknell Uni-
versity can tell you their name and that Agamemnon died in the
bathtub. This store of knowledge is somewhat supplemented by
the fact-that the wife of Bath was “gat-toothed”, and judgment is
spelled without the “e”. Oher students will mechanically recite,
“Test form D.... a,c, b,a,e,a,e....” While another, less for-
tunate group will go around shouting, “Who’s got one?’ or
“What are you going to study?” or desperately, “Can I have that
copy from 11:00 to 11:40?”

This is the typical day before the English Department des-
cends with its bi-annual Cumulative Test, or cumulative test (de-
pending on the amount of respect one has for these merciless
missles). These ctimulative tests are supposed to be comprehen-
sive reviews of your former courses in English. They include a

Penn State To Register Full |

y

For the first time since the end of World War II, Pennsylvania State Col-
lege will admit a freshmen class, including both men and women students, at
the beginning of the second semester, which opens on February 4.

In announcing the plan, President Milton S. Eisenhower said that “in these
emergency times, when industry and the armed forces need trained men and |
women, the College is especially anxious that its facilities be used to the full- |
est extent.” |

The decision to admit a freshman class in February will help recent high |
school graduates who want to begin college work before becoming subject to |
call under the Selective Service Act. During the war, the College operated |

| om an accelerated program, admitting three classes each year. |

Admission of freshmen at mid-semester will not prevent the College from

| granting admission to qualified students desiring to transfer from other col-
| leges or to those students who have completed their work at Penn State ex- |

tension centers and are ready to transfer to the campus, explains Dr. C. 0. |
| Williams, acting dean of admissions.

|
| The “Harvard Lampoon,’ campus humor magazine, finds itself in a very |

unfunny position. A state police lieutenant was recently assigned to investi- |
| gate the “filthy, obscene and licentious” magazine which was confiscated by |
| Massachusetts police. A district judge described the magazine as “not fit” to
| be taken into homes where there were mothers, fathers or sisters. The con-
tent of the magazine, according to its editor, are a collection of cartoons and
jokes from other college magazines.

The only department that does this at Bucknell is the Chemistry Depart-

Easton, Pa.—(I. P.)—Most modern educators recognize the importance
of acquainting students with the great ideas that shape our civilization, and
many colleges have tried to do this without regard to the artificial fences that
segregate departments, declares Dr. W. W. Watt, head of the English depart-
ment at Lafayette College. “Ambitious survey courses in ‘Great Books’,
‘Western Civilization,’ and ‘The Humanities’ appear in college catalogues

‘Anti-Flunk Caspaign’ Bae
Makes Bull Session Good

The University of Massachusetts
recently completed a full scale “Anti-
Flunk Campaign,” according to a re-
port by Robert S. Hopkins, ‘Jr., dean
of men.

The legend goes: freshmen who
dawdle while the leaves fall in October
are seldom on campus to the
buds of spring. One reason: too
much time devoted to “bull sessions.”
A second re
out

view

son: midyear exams weed
scholastic lightweights.

Believing that many students who
flunk out of college are lost because
of poor study, habits rather than lack
of brainpower, Dean Hopkins seized
the deadly “bull session” and turned
it to good use.

Eight weekly “bull sessions” on
“How to Study” were held in fresh-
man dormitories. Capacity crowds
attended, according to Dean Hopkins.
Students learned how to take notes,
how to budget time, how to improve
reading efficiency and how to plan for
exams.

foreman in the electrical repair shop.
After a few months, he was switched
to a day job involving the installa-
tion of motor control equipment in a
plate mill. His employment was in-
terrupted by service in the U. S. Sig-
nal Corps; after which he returned to
Bethlehem and was made moter con-
trol supervisor.

Following five years of engineering
experience, Dr. Irland came back to
Bucknell where he took up his teach-
Ing career. In 1922, he received his
Professional Degree as Electrical En-
gineer, for which he wrote a paper on
motor control devices. He received
his Master’s Degree in EE in 1925 and
his Doctor’s Degree in 1932. Both
degrees being conferred by Johns
Hopkins University. The work to-
wards his MEE was augmented by
summer graduate study at MIT and
Columbia.

In connection with his graduate
studies, he became interested in the
work of the U. S. Bureau of Mines,
and, in later years, succeeded in de-
veloping a seismometer for use in the
Investigation of earth vibrations from

‘Profs Just Don’t Get The Idea’
Says Student About Final Exams

by Don Raphael
“A bunch of boys were whooping it up, at one of the Klondike dancing

halls .. .” and in the dorm halls, and ii

in the hall-owed Burger, as per usual.

Then the dorm halls quiet down, and poor Myra finds the Burger worse than

ever. Why?

Well, kiddies, it’s what we would?
call a little exam action. For, as per
usual, the ivy even quiets down, and
silence reigns supreme on _ college
hill.

One thing, and one thing only hangs
heavier over the heads of the boys
than the draft. And the girls start
to worry about things other than the
man shortage next semester. Yep,
exams.

It seems that some faculty mem-
bers don’t realize that the main idea
of college is the education the stu-
dents receive. They still work by the
antideluvian theory that exams are
necessary to prove that their proteges
have received their education.

Most modern educators believe that
the ideas (scholastically speaking)
one recaives in college are the most
important thing to enlighten the stu-
dents and stimulate their minds.

What they don’t realize is that all
the good they do indoctrinating the
studes with all kinds of culture of
little or no value, in the long run.

For, one can never sit back and say
that “I’ve got my education, thanks
to dear old Lit 409”, but they must
then worry about giving all their ed-
ucation back to,the profs.

Then, on the other hand, the stude
is seriously handicapped in getting a
rounded education. He must give up
the best part of his time; studying
(such an ugly word!) memorizing and
all sorts of nasty things fill up the
night’s agenda, so on, ad nauseum.
Gone is the old familiar “Eleven
o’clock circle” of cars in front of Har-
ris. None of the old familiar jaunts
to the “Owl”, avec la femme. Nope,
things are in a very sad state indeed
during those two weeks.

Some say that “Hell Week occurs
when the fraternities initiate the
pledges, but those in the know insist
it occurs during the end of January
and June. People look just as beat-
up and bedraggled but it is purely a
psychological affect.

Some of hte women think the exams
are easier on the male’s pocketbook,
but they only judge by the coke dates
that are so predominant at that time.

young people to advertising. It is
hoped to encourage and guide people
who show promise for advertising and
to save those with less aptitude for
advertising from months of misdirect-
ed effort in wrong field of work. The
examination is comprised of a series
of aptitude-temperament tests com-
piled by specialists in personnel test-
ing, and a group of tests of practical

mosphere throughout the entire time,
a bon voyage party prior to sailing,
and visits in Europe to the opera,
theatre, teas, private cabanas, gondo-
las and gondolier serenading.

The tours are of 42, 44, 45 and 67
day periods, which during the past
six post-war years of operation have
proved most popular.

But a fellow has to contend with a
great deal more than just a woman’s
entertainment. He has serious things
on his mind, and noble purposes to
accomplish. And if you don’t think
that it can be quite expensive, ask
any man with a “Fort Pitt Tumor.”

With the arrival of the good old
summer time, one hates to be sitting
in Bayshores with one’s contempor-
aries about him and own up to the
fact that there were times when nil
could be done except . .. well, let’s
not use that nasty word again.

Some have taken the easy way out,
and enlisted, but for the vast major-
ity of us, we are placed in Mark
Twain’s sad state. (with apologies to

him). “Every one talks about finals,
no one does anything about

knowledge development by advertis-
ing agency executives. Industry vol-
unteers throughout the country super-
vise the tests.

The Examination is given to deter-
mine whether the individual appears
to have the abilities required for an
advertising career. Seven phases of
advertising work are covered: copy
writing, research, mechanical produc-
tion, radio and television, media selec-
tion, layout and art, and plans and
merchandising. Also included will be
an estimate of the testees’ selling ap-
titudes.

Besides serving as an estimate of
abilities, the test results may be
shown to employers as a concrete in-
dication of the individual’s potentiali-
ties. If the candidate wishes, he may
also authorize the American Associa-
tion of Advertising Agencies to cir-
culate his scores among employers in
the Philadelphia area.

As in previous years, a fee of $15.00
will be charged to cover part of the
cost of the examination. Additional
information and application blanks

Summer School Gets Nod From Dean
As Accelerated Program Is Stressed

Beginriing in June, 1951, the University will encourage students to ac-
celerate their graduation by accumulating extra credits in the Summer, accord-
ing to a recent statement from Dean W. H. Coleman’s office.

More courses than usual will
be offered during tthe eight-week term
of summer school. By attending three
or four summer sessions, most stu-
dents will be able to obtain degrees
jn three or three and one-half years.
Nine or more credits may be earned
each summer, three summer terms
being practically equivalent to one
year’s work.

The enlarged program will be of
especial advantage to students pur-
suing the liberal arts, commerce and
finance, and education curricula.
Many of the additional courses offered
will be those most essential for them.
But it also will be of benefit to those
studying for other bachelor of science
degrees. Some students will wish by
its means to lighten their programs
for the following semesters. This
plan will be especially advantageous
for men entering the R. O. T. C., for
the military training will make added

°.

demands upon their time.

In the cases of men liable to be
drafted, it is especially
that they get into college as soon as
they are prepared for it, and so ob-
tain as nearly a complete education as
possible. Their chances of deferment
to complete one or more years of col-
lege work will be improved by their
early enrolment.

Students already in college also will

important

be able to benefit by the fuller pro-|

gram of summer courses. It seems
probable that the inroads on man-
power made by the increase in the
armed forces will make a larger de-
mand than usual for college graduates
in business and industry. This de-
mand will be for women as well as
for men. The sooner all students can
prepare themselves for such oppor-
tunities, the sooner they will be pre-
pared to be of service.

[Attitude Of College Students

The typical attitude of the majority
of war-eligible young men at the Uni-
versity of California is, “We are bit-

illusioned, but we aren’t mad at any-
one specifically, and we’re not saying
‘to hell with it’.”

This, says a recent issue of Look
magazine, summarizes the attitude
toward the draft it found on the cam-
puses of four representative colleges,
California, Northwestern, Princeton,
and North Carolina. The vast major-
ity of students, the article reveals,

RELIGION-IN-LIFE-WEEK APPROACHED FROM
VOCATIONAL ANGLE, CA SECRETARY SAYS

by George

Woodward

Bucknell’s annual Religion-In-Life Week, sponsored by the University
administration through the auspices of the University Christian Association,

will include this year a new organizational plan that will bring the meaning

and scope of the program much closer

Because it has been so difficult in§

the past to plan-a program that would
be vital and interesting to all stu-
dents in all the departments of the
University, this year’s program has
been geared so that each of the major
fields of study will have a separate
academic convocation.

The leaders of these convocations
are men and women specially trained
in these fields, men who will be able
effectively to relate the total program
to the individual study groups. The
,| student will then be in a more capable
position to understand his own rela-
tionship to the problems that confront
our own University and universities
in general.

The academic have
been studying the problems over the
past semester in anticipation of this
year’s program. Convocations in
Engineering, English and Languages,
Commerce and Finance, Natural
Sciences, and Humanities have been
organized, each with a convocation
leader prominent in the particular

leaders, to mention only a few, are

The student chairmanship of this
year‘s program is held by Bud Bush,
’51.. For its theme, this eighth con-
secutive annual program has “The

Preparation tho’ we s

They take it for granted we’re mules.

Everything past and that passes.

Illumination—Eureka!
Though you seldom reward

Library Cornerstone Ceremony

Is Scheduled For February 24th

Laying of the cornerstone of the
new library by President Horace Hil-
dreth will take place ngxt Saturday,
February 24, at noon. Dr. Norman
Stewart, chairman of the library com-
mitee of. the University Faculty, is in
charge of planning the brief informal
trand Library. Although the $750,000
building has had several contributors,
Mrs. Bertrand has been the chief
donor.

Students Invited

The student body is invited to at-
tend the ceremony in which represen-
tatives of the board of trustees, the
faculty, the library, and students will
participate. The ceremony is being
held outdoors at the site of the front
door. Dr. Stewart, professor of
zoology, will give the invocation which
preceeds short speeches to be made by
Dr. Mary Wolfe, chairman of the
building and grounds committee of
the board of trustees; Harold W. Hay-
den, librarian; and John T. Maeby,
president of Student-Faculty Con-
gress. Dr. Hildreth will then lay the
cornerstone and give a few remarks
to be followed by the pronouncement
of the bendiction by Dr. Charles M.
Bond, professor of religion.

Sealed For~-Posterity

In the cornerstone a copper box,
13 x 4 x 9 inches will be sealed for
posterity. Documents of historical
interest to the University and the |
community such as the Centennial

auguration of Horace A. Hildreth, The
Bucknell Alumnus, reports of the
president, treasurer, and librarian,
Bucknell: Bulletins, survey and _pic-
torial maps, wire recordings of the
Centennial Commencement and sched-
ules of athletic games will be placed
in the box. Also contained in the
box will be group photographs of all
fraternities, sororities and BISA with
appended lists of members.
Center Point

Standing on the most commanding
site of the campus, the Bertrand Li-
brary will have two stories and a 40-
foot tower with a clock. The library
will be the center point of the campus,
being able to be seen from distant
points. Besides a large reading room
and periodical room there will also
be an art gallery, a browsing room,
a rare book room (in these rooms it
will be possible to hold receptions
with the use of the proposed kitchen),
a music listening room, seminar rooms
for the various departments, faculty
study rooms and a visual aids library
with a projection room that can seat
100, an office and storage space. The

| office will be for Mr. Walter Holter,

head of the visual aids department.
The new projection room will enable
the faculty to take their classes there
to see movies. In the Bertrand li-
brary 400,000 volumes can be accom-
modated in six stack levels in the cen-
tral part of the building; the Car-

A Different Kind Of Brotherhood

People of our generation who set out to call attention to
themselves or their organization have gotten into the habit of
setting aside a specified week of the year and bestowing upon it
the name of the cause in which they are campaigning.

Some of these ar ite, niggling, 1 about as necessary as

\nd some, on the other hand, are conscientious
ng something worthwhile to the attention of the
\merican people

In his latter category comes the observance sponsored by the
National Conference of Christians and Jews called Brotherhood
Week which begins this Sunday, February 18th and continues
through the 25th. Unlike some of the other projects of this sort,
Brotherhood Week doesn’t requiretthat you spend a certain num-
ber of hours of the day making peaceful overtures to stray tom-
cats, or knitting nose-warmers for the underprivileged three-year-
olds of Central Afghanistan.

Norton, Mass.—(I. P.)—The official grading system of Wheaton College,
effective this year, specifies the use of letter grades, with plus and minus devi-
j ations. This system substitutes the previous one in which numerical values
; Were assigned by the faculty, but which appeared on student report cards as
| letter grades. Voted in by faculty decision, the first grades to be affected are
| the marks received by freshmen at mid-semesters.

| Davidson, N. C.—(I. P.)—As the result of an experiment made at David-
son College last year, the student body has opened a “Serve Yourself” store on
| the campus. It is pointed out that were it not for the honor system in effect
| here, this store would be an impossibility.
Stores of this nature are now being operated in many colleges in the
j country. Best known of these stores is that at Washington and Lee Univer-
| sity, Lexington, Va., where all kinds of student supplies are priced, placed
before the students and the cash drawer left open for the student to make his
own change. This store has been effectively operated for several years and
is an object of pride of every Washington and Lee student.
It is the desire of the authorities and the students at Davidson to make the
| Honor Store on this campus one of equal merit with that of Washington and
Lee. The plan, instituted this year as a test, will become permanently estab-
| lished if it proves successful. The Student Council acts as the Board of Di-
rectors for this enterprise.

When cleaning shops in Norman, Oklahoma raised their prices last week,
Okiahoma University’s student senate called for a boycott. They proclaimed
‘Saggy Sooner Days,” making spotted, unpressed clothing the style until the
back down. The students at Oklahoma U responded immediate

the Oklahoma Daily as saying, “He was losing money and didn’t want to see
it (the beycott) go any farther.” He added that other N
cleaners f and suggested that something might be worked out.
At noon on the eighth day, with no settlement reached, Oklahoma students
| settled down for prolonged campaign and set up picket lines in front of
cleaning firms near the campus.

ston, Pa.—(I. P.)—Retarded reading and broken homes are among the
failures in college, Prof. Frank R. Hunt,. dean of
students at Lafayette College, says after a three-year study of reasons for
failures.

Dean Hunt asserts that too many students arrive at college with inade-
quate preparation, a limited vocabulary and a general inability to comprehend
issues from the printed page. The remedy, he suggests, is smaller classes,
more teachers, a more careful selection of those planning to prepare for college
and more personal attention to those students.

If these are the main causes for failure, then morons can stop worrying.

months. Pops has giventup the music-
critic business, and is now hawking
chocolate bars and orangeade in a
theatre in Union City, N. J. He
writes me that he is very happy there.

Although many of us frequently
disagreed with him and his writings,
perhaps sometimes because he went
over our heads completely, we all real
ly liked the chap. Far from being a
wheel on this campus, he was, never-
theless, a great guy. Which reminds
us—while it’s swell to be important,

it’s more important to be swell.

Do you believe the honor system

There seems to be quite a hullabaloo
around campus about the merits of
the present honor system.. As of
now, only the fair maidens of this

include examinations, and having our
men on campus set a time limit on
themselves.

As for saying which is right, we do
not know; but perhaps the opinions
of various personages I have conve:
ed with at great length on the subject
will let you decide for yourselves.

Therefore, we proceeded (quick like
a bunny) to Larison living room
where we met Pat Forlifer strumming
away on the piano.

Pat gave us a rather roundabout
reply: “Well-theoretically, it’s a won-
derful idea, but it would actually
never work. Boys will be boys!”

Aha—that’s a little gem of wisdom
in itself. Remember that girls!

Cindy Luks and Nan Martin also
dropped by and ventured a few choice
words of wisdom?

Cindy—“No! Men are never hon-
orable!”

Hm-m-m-m. A cynic perhaps, no?

Nancy—“Oh yes! It would be un-
fair to the girls if just the girls were
on their honor and the boys would
take advantage of it.”

Blundering Staffer Recites
Trials Of Embryo Reporter

by Bob Bell
, At 3:42 I slowly eased open the door of the BUCKNELLIAN office. As a
prospective new addition to the staff, | was awed by the sight that met my
eyes, Typists were batting out two hundred words a minute; the floor was
littered with rejected material; Mac, the editor, was begging the printer for a

two minute time extension; and I went
the door. It didn’t work.

Mac announced that the extension?
had been granted and the office re-
laxed. The typists slawed to one
hundred and eighty words, and I
opened the window to get some air.
The gentle Lewisburg breeze filled the
room with flying copy, Mac stepped
over and gently rebuked me.

“Mac, I’ve Got It!”

As I was picking myself off of the
floor, Bill Bellamy, news editor, skidd-
ed in gasping, “Mac, I’ve got it. That
last story we need to fill the front
page. I can see the headline now...
MILLIONS MOURN AS IVY SUC-
CUMBS.”

The staff went wild as they realiz-
ed that their work was finished for
another week until the small voice of
the lay-out man announced, “We’re
still one column short.” For 30 prec-
ious seconds the room was still, then
Bill raced out into the hall and
the echoes of a shot rang out. Mac
stepped outside, and in a moment re-
turned clad in black, two large tears
polling down his cheeks. “Gentle-
men,” he said, “We have our story.
Bellamy’s obituary.”

As I was hurrying from the sad
scene, my foot kicked the jacket of a
blank pistol shell and my nose detect-
ed a sharp vegetable odor. Laugh-
ingly I said, “O. K. faker, you can get,
up now. Your catchup is showing.”

The Last Laugh

Hearing Mac’s soft, slow step be-
hind me, I turned to find him towering
over me. “You meddling fool,” he

Nation’s Hallowed Halls Slate
Accelerated Schedules In Near
Future To.Compete With. Draft

The “accelerated course” is being considered by many colleges and univer-
sities all over the country. Three and four semster years ar being installed
to enable men to complete as much college work as possible before the draft
“catches” them, These are what a few of the nation’s higher halls of learning

are planning:

Wagner College, Staten Island, will
adapt its curriculum to meet the
emergency by going on a three-semes-
ter year, beginning with the summer
session. Students will be able to
complete their college work in less
than the normal four years.

Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y.,
will offer an accelerated program
which is to start with a summer ses-
sion on July 2 and will enable stu-
dents to complete a normal four-year
course in somewhat less than three
years,

Columbia College announced that
students holding scholarships will
have them reserved until their return
from military service if they are
drafted o decide to enlist.

Carnegie Institute of Technology,
Pittsburgh, will*admit a freshman
class this June to ten of its depart-
ments, in addition to its regular Sep-
tember class. An accelerated pro-
gram for the present freshmen in
clence, engineering and _ industrial
management, but not for the junior
and senior classes, is now under con-
sideration.

The University of Wisconsin Law
School this term is offering for the
first time a course in military law for
senior students.

Trinity College, Hartford, Conn.,
announces that its trustees have ap-
proved a full semester summer school
and admission of freshmen both in
June and September.

‘Some of them

are pretty sad!’’

Maetancholy and dejected, this gloomy miss

found little to titillate her in the recent deluge of quick-

trick cigarette tests! She was not enthralled by the idea of

judging cigarette mildness with just a fast puff or a single sniff.

But, joy of joys! .. . happiness came to her when she

discovered one test that left no doubt in her mind.

It was thé sensible test! .. . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,

which simply asks you to

on a pack after pack, day

try Camels as a steady smoke —

after day basis. No snap judgments

needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels,— and only

Letters to the Editor

Letter to the Editor
February 8, 1951
Dear Sir:

This letter is to protest the recent
handling of the Old Shoe Trophy by
the Bucknell administration. How
dignified it looks sitting among a pile
of shirts at one of the downtown
Lewisburg shops!

First, why didn’t the administration
see fit to display the trophy for a
| reasonable time on campus for the
enjoyment of the students? After
| all, it was their team that won it.

Secondly, if it is to be displayed
downtown for the benefit of everyone,
| why was it not displayed properly in
a window not cluttered with merchan-
dise? Let us hope that in the future
| the administration will use a_ little

more discretion.

Sincerely,
Herb Schloo

Dear Editor:

The writer of this letter has no
claim to fame as either a scholar or a
“gentleman.” At times I have been
accused of a few minor vices around
campus. However, I have now dis-
covered that I am a paragon of virtue
on this campus. Why? That is an
excellent question. The answer is
that I have heard the rumor that
some character politely stole the
March of Dimes box out of Roberts
Hall. 1 don’t think that I need say
more on the subject. The students of
Bucknell will say the rest.

Thank you,

THE BUCKNELLIAN

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1951.

Every editor has an old, rather worn, but always timely issue
he can pull out of the fire when the deadline approaches and
yawning holes remain unfilled on the editorial pages. For semes-
ters on end the “‘ace-in-the-hole” of Bucknellian editors has been
the topic of SCHOOL SPIRIT. The reams of editorial copy
written on this subject if placed end to end would probably reach
from Davis Gym to Memorial Stadium. The spirit they create
probably never reaches the inside of these athletic arenas.

Recently there has been ample and just cause to wonder why

here should be a revival of school spirit. The disorganized

beyond which the element of accidental contact cannot be accept-

by Babs Fiedler
The editor of the “Connecticut Campus” worked out a way to get even with
| those who insist that their letters to the editor be printed—with no cutting.
; At Connecticut, the president of Panhellenic insisted that a letter be printed
| and promised that she would be around to make sure it went in without any
| deletions.
The obliging editor printed the complete letter and sprinkled asterisks
| throughout the copy. In an editor’s note, he explained: “All asterisks in the
letter refer to errors in grammar, spelling and typing, which we felt honor-
| bound to leave unchanged in view of our unconditional compliance with Miss
| Oppell’s wishes.” Consistently mispelled in the Panhell president’s letter—
| the word sorority.
The reaction to this editorial technique was immediate. Among the
charges in the next day's letters column were, “You are small minded” .. . “the

sorority sisters accusing the paper of printing biased editorial coni.nents.

The Daily Texan has come up with the idea that student honorary scho-
| lastie groups should do more than just decorate their member’s watch chains.

The Texan suggests that these groups set up a student tutorial service. The
idea is this. Members of the honoraries could offer student-to-student help to
| those on scholastic probation. The paper advocates setting several library
nooks or Union cubbyholes aside for tutoring purposes, and having each mem-
| ber of an honorary keep one hour a week to tutor students who need help.

SEEN ON THIS CAMPUS... A girl rushing up to the Student Bank Sat-
urday morning to withdraw some vitally needed money. She was informed
that it was impossible to get her money. She went to another source, stressed
the seriousness of the situation, and met with the same refusal. She then,
being offered no other choice wired her mother for the money. This siutation
| rather brings te mind an interesting, if untue little epigram;

Any fool can make a rule,
And every fool will follow it.

THIS IS A M "S WAR?...

Coeds at Northwestern University report they have been getting letters
from the war department urging them to join the Women’s Army Corps. In-
ducements were a $275-a-month pay check, a second Lieutenant’s commission
and a “permanent career.”

“Reaction to the letter was mostly negative,” according to the Daily
Northwestern. One girl remarked, “My fiance would disown me if I enlisted.
He’s in the Coast Guard and I’d have a higher rank than he if I went in.”

Bullets Favored To Win Meet;
Frosh Cagers Take First Loss

There will be no dull moments dur-
ing the 13th annual meet of
Middle Atlantic Collegiate W
Association at, Davis Gym, March 2
and 3.

The Middle Atlantic Association de-
cision to Stage bouts simultaneously
on two mats assures unusual action
for the opening sessions Friday night
and Saturday afternoon. Individual
and team championships will be de-
cided in the tournament finals, Sat
urday night.

Big Entry

With 64 wrestlers scheduled to com-
pete in the tourney, Middle Atlantic
officials sanctioned the dual-mat plan
because of the large entry. The two-
day eliminations call for a total of 86
bouts, including 56 in the champion-
ship flight and 24 for
points.

Gettysburg College will defend the
Middle Atlantic honors for the second
year in a row. The contenders will
be Bucknell, Delaware, Haverford,
Lafayette, Muhlenberg, Swarthmore,
and Ursinus.

Bullets Tough

Coach Clyde’Cole’s ‘squad proved
this past weekend that it is again the
team to beat. The Gettysburg wrest-
lers turned in a convincing. victory,
22 to 8, over Bucknell’s highly rated
squad that was unbeaten in four en-
counters with Middle Atlantic foes.
Gettysburg is undefeated in three
Middle Atlantic starts.

consolation

Two of the five champions who will
defend division titles are Gettysburg
men. They are John Loose, 121-
pounder, and Jim Woods, 130-pound
champ.

by Paul Ganz

Bill Lane’s bid for a modern fresh-
man winning streak was rudely over-
ruled by the Penn State Frosh when

undly drubbed the Baby Bisons

5 t Wednesday at State College.

The Frosh were striving for their
eighth straight decision but at the
thirty mark, walked from the huge
State court with their first loss of the
season.

The Jr. Herd had no trouble solving
the zone defense set up by the Staters,
and, with little Jeff Mynott leading
the way, jumped to a lead which they
held until one minute before the half.

At the fifty-five second mark State,
léd by Bob Sherry, a new addition to
the team, poured six points through
the hoop to go out in front 24-23.

Outranged

The Lion cubs controlled the re-
bounds during the second half, a feat
which dealt the death blow to the
Bison, as they fielded a team ranging
from six-two to six-fi They also
switched from their conventional zone
defense to a shifting mdan-for-man.
It was during the third period that
the Staters began to pull away and by
the outset of the concluding quarter
had garnered a nine point spread.

The final period marked the end for
the Jr. Heid as State built up their
lead and left the Bison battling only
the clock.

Jim Poff, who led the same Bison
quintet to a 51-31 win over a slightly
altered State Frosh earlier in the
year, was constantly double-teamed
by the towering Lions and dropped
below his twenty point average as he
racked up eleven points for the night.
Captain Jeff Mynott took high honors
for the Orange and Blue youngsters
with 12 points.

In seven days these men who accepted money to throw games have been re-

Madison Square Garden, considered the mecca of the cage sport may also
go down in history as the nemesis of the sport. The mixture of commercial
sports sponsorship and amateur athletics, which has been partially responsible
for creating interest in the game, has succumbed to the powerful and wealthy
gambling syndicates. All of which makes the boys who cried “Beware the

tions amateur basketball is faced with the possibility of being forced to with-
draw from the more lucrative, big-time sports palaces to the protection of the
cdllege campus, where there may be fewer bad influences but less income ac-
companying.

All of which brings to mind a suggestion made recently by Dr. “Phog”
Allen, coach at the University of Kansas. Dr. Allen proposes a basketball
commissioner, similar to the late baseball commissioner Judge Landis. One
of the duties of the court czar would be to investigate and discontinue the game
where there is evidence of gambling control. Gambling has been wide-open
in New York and a responsible commissioner might have been able to put the
quietus on the gamblers before the present trouble blossomed forth.

It’s too late now to bemoan the fact that college athletes can be bribed,
but the colleges and universities had better act fast if they want to save the
sport.

Receptionist Plays Varied Roles
As Go-Between In College Dating

by Pete Tasch
Combining the best qualities of a diplomat, mind reader, fortune teller,
and errand runner, the girl on desk duty in the women’s dormitories has to be

2 paragon of tact and patience.
Typical among these behind ?the-
desk girls is Lu Pinner, who, after
three years of wholesale baby sitting,
knows more about more people—and

still keeps it to herself.

Lu applied for the job through stu-
dent aid. Like the more than sixty
other girls, she spends several hours
each week,*starting anytime after
8:00 in the morning on week days, and
9:00 on Sundays, until 11:00 at night,
helping the boys find the girls, and,
occasionally, the girls find the boys.

On blind dates, Lu serves as the go-
between, as the boys query her about
the girls, and the girls do the same
about the boys. Many times, she has
pointed the two out to each other.

Perhaps one of her trickiest duties
is to remember messages, and see
that when she tells “Jack” that his
date is somewhere else, he is really
“Jack”. Usually, by a process of
elimination, she can tell which boy
belongs to whom.

Then too, Lu is invaluable to the
girl who wants to be dressed as well
as the boy. The unsuspecting male
is mentally tabulated and a full des-
cription is hurried to the girl who
doesn’t know which dress to wear.

There are several categories into
which the visiting beaux fall. Num-
ber one, for instance, waits in the re-
ception hall for ten minutes, reading
the paper, or chatting; and then cas-
ually announces himself. Number
two can never decide which name goes
with which bell—this often leads to
complications when he rings his old
flame by mistake.

Then, there is the type who trys to
ring the bell without anybody know-

ing who his date is. This shy guy

yan’t win, for Lu either knows him
from the description received from his
date, or will see her when the two
leave. Another cheery fellow is the
one who rings all the bells with reck-
less abandon.

Among the duties performed by Lu
and the others are answering the
phone calls and delivering those mes-
sages and special delivery packages
that often come. And always, the
biggest package goes to the highest
floor.

This job is ideal to the student of
human nature, for every conceivable
type, sooner or later, visits the girls’
dormitories. To Lu, it’s a lot of fun.

Should Frosh | Gals Be Pinned?

by Elaine Vouyoukas
A surprising number of freshman girls have been sporting the pins of
various fraternities on campus, so I thought a timely question would be: “Do
you think it’s advisable for girls to be pinned in their first year of college?”

I first asked the opinions of a few?

members of a fraternity known to
take their pinning seriously, the K.
D. R.’s.

The house and its members were
turned into a pandamonium, or should
I say a small uproar for the less
erudite, when the question was asked.
Needless to say, for the first ten min-
utes nothing could be understood but
a jarble of words. However, after
that the words came thick and fast.

Pete Peterson, John Walker, and
Dick Shultz were all for the idea.
Dick, however, elaborated on the idea
and gave a_ paradoxical statement
that, nevertheless, is far too true in
many cases.

Dick said, “Yes, girls of 18 are of
age—they should know what they’re
doin’, but they don’t!”

Well it seems that not only applys
to 18 year olds, but women of all ages
unfortunately!

Charlie Cooper, also
tempted to drown out his brothers
with NO, NO, NO! When he calmed
down to a roar, I asked him what
were his reasons.

He finally consented to end the is-
sue by just saying that: “They’re too
young to know what they’re doin’.”

KDR at-

I gather from the statements of the
K. D. R.’s that women never know
what they’re doing! Well now, I
wouldn’t say that!

I decided the female viewpoint had
better enter into the discussion fast
before I got myself into a hopeless
muddle. So I asked Sue Owens her
opinion from the feminine angle.

There was no hesitation in Sue’s
mind as she replied: ‘Definitely not,
I think a fraternity pin at Buckneli
should mean a_ lot. Therefore it
would involve serious consideration of
both parties.”

Well done, thou good and faithful
servant! But we have some differ-
ences of opinion on that first state-
ment from the Lambda Chi’s.

Kenny Roberts, a Lambda Chi, says:
“Well, a pin at Bucknell doesn’t
usually mean that much anyway, un-
less an understanding has been reach-
ed. In such cases, a pin is considered
an engagement. Otherwise, it’s a
“going steady” pin. I guess it
wouldn’t be to bad, in most cases, for
a freshman girl to be pinned.”

Jack Tress, a T. K. E.,, is of the
opinion that there’d have to be little

I then asked the opinion of one of

Lonny Cupp, a DZ pledge, gave an
agreeable answer, I’m sure, to all the
supporters of this cause.

She said: “I definitely don’t see

When I walked past the studio of
WVBU, the suction from buzzing con-
fusion whisked me within the halls of
‘bitter end.’ When the chair flew by
my head and the rug slipped from
under my feet, it didn’t take long to
draw but on conclusion—cleaning up!

(It might as well be spring?)
Then in an official tone of voice a
member of the Board of Directofs
said, “Hastings, we’re renovating this

duties in various capacities. (There

© While spending our mid-semester

vacation in Florida, Pat Lewis and I
decided to look around this school
about which we’d heard so much. We
set out with the intention of looking
up Jackie Smith, the skilled little
twirler from Bucknell, who acquired a
seholarship to the University of Miami
last year.
College Town

The picturesque Floridian town of
Coral Gables is perhaps one of the
nicest college towns in the United
States. The main street is clean and
white, lined with good modern stores,
movies, and the like. The college is
situated at one end of the town, just
past Doctor’s Hospital. The first im-
posing building that met our eyes was
the Merrick Building. It is a long
white structure of modern architec-
ture, having archways and unenclosed
halls. Huge windows frame the li-
brary in this building.

Continuing on, we came to a large
group of buildings that gave one the
impression of barracks enclosed by a
fence. We found the office of women
here, for these were the girl’s dormi-
tories, and upon asking f Jackie
Smith, a girl popped up exclaiming
she was her roommate. After pro-

each having a livingroom, kitchenette,

the rooms are nice, the regulations

Joe Whipple went skiing for the
first time this season in Stowe, Ver-
mont. He didn’t get further than the
first 100 yards. At that time, he
tried to make a turn, hit a patch of
ice and “just fell”. He got up and
tried to ski but couldn’t as he had no
control of his foot. So he walked
down the hill to a doctor.

He discovered that he had chipped
a bone in his foot and would be in a
cast for some time and then crutches
would follow. His doctor obligingly
autographed his cast with “Best
Wishes from Stowe, Vermont!”

Joe told the group that it hurts
more now than it did at the time of
the accident. He also described the
wonderful time and the wonderful
service he received at the Phi Gam
houses at Lehigh and Lafayette—
“Had more fun after the accident than
before.” Joe philosophized, “people
that ‘don’t know you, feel sorry for
you, people that do—laugh.”

Academic Honor System For BU

A committee composed of interested students has recently been formed

to study the possibilities of establishing

Four committees who work in con-9
junction with the central committee
have been set up. These committees
are the Publicity Committee, a Stu-
dent Relations Committee, a Student-
Faculty Relationships Committee, and
a Student-Administration Relations
Committee.

The Publicity Committee has set as
its purpose the acquainting of the
students and faculty with all the ad-
vantages of having such a_ system
here. Questionnaires have been sent
to other colleges which have a scho-
lastic honor system.

The results of these questionnaires
will be published in the Bucknellian,
so that the students can see the vari-
ous methods of organizing such a
system and also the reactions of stu-
dents who live under this system.

Will Sample

The Student Relations Committee
has planned to approach students
from all walks of campus life to
sample their opinions. In addition, a
preliminary questionnaire has been
submitted to faculty members in
which they can present their opin-

an academic honor system at Bucknell,

ions,

In personal conferences, the Stu-
dent-Faculty Committee has also
sought the suggestions of faculty
members who have agreed to support
the system if the students express
their desire to have it.

The administration has also been
interviewed as to their reactions to
establishing the system. The reac-
tions of the students, faculty, and ad-
ministration will be published in the
Bucknellian in future issues.

Forum Planned

The committee has planned to have
2 forum after all facts have been pre-
sented to the student body. At this
forum the committee invites all stu-
dents who have any reaction, whether
favorable or unfavorable, to partici-
pate in the discussion. ‘

This is a student project. The
committee is endeavoring to investi-
gate the possibilities of organizing an
acedemic honor system here. If you
wish to offer your services, please

Morals Shmorals

While leafing through the exchange papers recently for an
editorial idea to filch, we came upon that good paper, the JUNIA-
TIAN, whose editor it seems had been similarly occupied, his
field of research being the new Sears and Roebuck catalogue.

For there on the editorial page, in neatly spaced bold face,
he expounded on the deteriorating morals of the present Ameri-
can generation as evidenced by the advertising of a new Sears
ind Roebuck doll house replete with a bar and the usual acces-
sories. This, he held, was characteristic of the pleasure seeking
tendencies of most people today.

We had to disagree.

\ country that has taken the giant steps this one has in edu-
cation, science, and world leadership should be tolerated a few
impish notions like putting bars in doll houses, we thought. Per-
haps this is cable to that paradox of our culture which allows
us to produce Dwight Eisenhower and men like the uniformed
buffon, General Harry Vaughan, in the same generaton, or send
sur armed forces halfway around the world to die while we kill
ff an equal number of the population right here in automobile
Things of this sort, we think, are part of our culture.
We don’t mind them putting bars in doll houses.

We like it.
We hope they put in roulette wheels.

George Washington Slept Here

Black may be becoming on some people, but when manufac-
turers start using that somber tone to decorate furniture some-
thing is amiss. And the furniture in various rooms in various
dorms is just that color. It brings to mind atime element. Per-
haps color wasn’t invented when the furniture was installed. Or
perhaps this is a measure of durability, so it won’t peel in hot
weather when the heat is blasting, or freeze in winter.

The assistant dean of Pittsburgh University’s medical school declared re-
| cently, ‘“‘There is no quota system in use in the (Pitt) medical school.”
| This statement and others made by the dean on that occasion were labelled
’ and “circular talk.” The News said
! the dean offered no sound reason for the school’s including racial and religious
| questions on the application; only that “they have been in that form since
| 1909.”
| The dean went on to say that it is the duty of the medical school tosupply |
| the wants of the community, and the community considers racial and religious |
| backgrounds in selecting its physicians.

“If that is true,” commented the News, “then Pitt’s medical school cer- |
tainly should have quotas. Yet the good doctor says it has not.” Summing |
up, the News declared, “The quota system (may) not be down on paper so as

Dear Editor:

At any university, no matter what
the size, a student humor magazine
must exist.

Although I have been here only
since February, I believe there is a
definite need for a rebirth of The
Squirl.

The gap between the short feature
story, the cartoon, and the occasional
joke printed in The Bucknellian, and
the humor in The Bucknell Engineer
should be filled. A humor magazine
would be a haven for fledging humor-
ists, short story writers, photograph-
ers, cartoonists,, and the like.

Humor in the college magazine
doesn’t have to be obscene to be funny
—tThe Cornell Widow, and The Johns
Hopkins Jaywalker are excellent ex-
amples of that. They get their ideas
across without worrying about fed-
eral postal regulations.

A humodr magazine would help
strengthen school spirit, and at the
same time, give the student journalist

Scared Sem Gems

To The Editor:

Recently, I, as a poor unsuspecting
| student, walked cheerfully into a cer-
tain’ office in Roberts Hall and asked
if it would be possible to drop a course
in one department and add a course
jin another department.

My request was answered with a
very blunt and terse NO! My excuse
| was not sufficient enough for me to
drop the course! As I walked meekly
out I began to wonder about this
whole problem. It seems very strange
} to me that you are allowed to sign up
| for the courses of your choice without
| any questions being asked, but when
| you find, for some reason that you do

not wish to take a course, you are sub-
| ject to a third degree as to your rea-
| sons for dropping it.

If a student finds that he does not

IMFORTANT INFORMATION FOR SENIORS RELATIVE TO
SELECTIVE SERVICE

Seniors graduating may request from their local Draft Board a 30-day
waiver in which time to secure a position which will be of aid to the nation in
its mobilization efforts. All seniors may not be eligible because the securing
of such a position will depend largely on the course they pursued in college.
Yor instance, a graduate in education would not be eligible unless he could
secure a position teaching chemistry, biology, physics, etc. The local Draft
Board then will have to decide if the position is essential or not

If the position is not deemed essential, the senior graduating may then
request another 30-day waiver in order to have the opportunity to enlist in the
branch of service he desires. Juniors, sophomores, and freshmen are also
eligible for this latter 30-day waiver.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
Number 13...THE OCELOT

“T don’t mean

but I hate
pussyfooting!”’

Our feline friend may not be from Missouri, but she sure
likes to be shown! She saw right through those thin, quick-trick, cigarette
tests and realized you couldn’t fairly judge a cigarette’s mildness with a
mere one puff or a swift sniff. Right on the spot, she decided they weren’t
fur her! Sophisticated, but shrewd, she knew what she wanted.
The Sensible Test . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,
which simply asks you to try Camels as your steady
smoke—on a pack after pack, day after day basis.
No snap judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels—
and only Camels—for 30 days in your “T-Zone”
(T for Throat, T for Taste), we believe you'll know why...

University trustees, faculty members,

across the wooden planks leading to the front entrance of Bucknell’s latest
edifice, the Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library, to take part in and observe the lay-

The preliminary ceremonies took?
place in the main room of the rapidly
rising structure. Although the long
room was cold and damp with the

gathering looked about the building
with admiration and anticipation.

THE BUCKNELLIAN, BU

Gettysburg Sub Sinks Herd;

Strassner, Gallagher Star

In an almost carbon copy of their thrilling game of two weeks ago, the
Gettysburg Bullets again squeezed out a narrow win in an overtime period over

the Bison basketballers last night in Gettysburg, 96-91.
°

Battle Close

From the beginning to its spine-
tingling finish the contest was a nip-
and-tuck battle which saw a substitute
and an injury plagued player take top
scoring honors. George Pizzalato,
replacing the injured George Hare for
Gettysburg, stole the scoring show as
he dropped in a total of 36 points for
the evening. Bucky Strassner, in a
remarkable display of courage, led the
Bisons with 30 points although every
step on his pain-ridden legs was
agony.

Gettysburg started in a flash and
sped to a first quarter lead of 26-19.
The Bisons were having trouble stay-
ing with the Bullets until four min-
utes remaining in the half when a

rry of baskets brought them to
within four points. However, Hank
Belber stole the ball for an easy lay-
up and with seconds to go dropped in

The third quarter found the Bisons
closing the gap and the score at the
end of that period was Bucknell 58,

period the Bisons momentarily over-
took the Bullets and from there on
it was a basket-for-basket affair.

The Muhlenberg Mules gave the Bison Matmen a 16-14 left-footed kick in
the seat of their wrestling tights last Saturday night in Davis Gym. Muhlen-

Bison Blitz Sweeps

Through North;

Rochester, Colgate Falter And Fall

by Jack Gamble
Bison cagers, paced by Joe Gallagher’s 29 points, pulled one of the biggest
basketball upsets of the week as they knocked a highly favored Colgate quintet
out of the National Invitational bidding 82-76.

Wrong Team? bi

The Red Raiders still have high
hopes of going to Peoria, Ulinois for
the first annual College Campus Tour-
nament, but the style with which the
Guymen defeated the upstate five
shows the Herd to deserve the invita-
tion more than the Indians.

Paced by forwards Joe Gallagher
and Marty McKibbin, the Herd went
in front at the outset of the contest
and were headed only once during the}
first period by a mere two buckets.
“Tex”, as one sportswriter prefers to
call Marty, took over the forward spot
vacated by Bucky Strassner, who suf-
fered a re-injury of his knee the pre-
vious night at Rochester. He hit for
19 points and second high honors on
the Bison squad.

Galloping Gallagher

The unusua! aspect of Gallagher’s
scoring spree was fashioned by the
clock and the referee’s whistle. At
the 10:45 mark in the second half Joe
was forced to leave the floor on five
personals after hitting 11 field goals
and seven free throws for the night’s
high of 29 points. Had he been al-
lowed to stick around the final margin
might have been a bit higher as he
was hitting close to 40 percent of his
shots during the second half.

It was a slightly altered Bison five
that took the Huntington Gym floor
due to injuries and the overabundance
of height in the Raider camp.

The Herd started out strong run-
ning up a 12-7 lead before Dave Al-
ton could hit from outside the Bison’s
tight man-for-man defense and pull
the Raiders to a 16-14 advantage.
The score remained such only long
enough for a quick glance at the score-

WE DARE

board as Connie DeLoca came through
with three quick hooks. After that
the Raiders knew the expressions on
the Bison faces meant “You’ve Had
It!”

Action remained comparatively
quiet for the rest of the first half as
the Herd outscored, outplayed, and
second-guessed the Raiders all the
way to take a mid-game lead 39-33.

Dodd Left Hooks

Bill Dodd, high scoring ace for
Howie Hartman, was held to one field
goal and one foul shot in the first
half but exploded with all he had to
cop 20 more points in the second.
Even with all their height and scoring
of Alton and Dodd, the Raiders could
not narrow the margin, which at times
was jockeying between 17. and 15
points.

The strain began to show in the
closing minutes when the up-state
New Yorkers put on the full court
press. Strella was forced out on fouls
and the entire team had picked up
fc is apiece, but remained calm

ivers later left the floor
with their greatest victory of the sea

YELLOWJACKETS FALL

Jack Guy’s thundering herd started
a strenuous weekend journey by de-
feating the University of Rochester,
at the Rochester Palestra on Friday
night. The Bisons drove the sting
out of the Yellowjackets with a great
second half scoring surge which net-

she asks, “that she can’t connect them

and it would be so much simpler for
them to call the houses direct.”

the past, strictly classicalish. But
since the students pay for these con-

considerable interest in our ranks in
music of the jazz vein, why couldn’t
one of these concerts feature jazz
music? An attraction such as LOUIS
ARMSTRONG and his group or NOR-

Dr. Norman Stewart

KKK
by Bobbie Maurer

Forty and a half years in the ser- |
vices of one university is a long time |
—twice as long as most of us have
lived. Such is the case with Dr. Nor-
man Stewart, professor of zoology at

Bucknell, who has taught under

of its presidents and worked with s

pastors of the Baptist Church. |
Dr. Stewart taught general zoology
here for 30 years, but after turning}
this task over to Dr. Tasker, he has
been devoting his time to subjects

such as embriology, and histology, and
is the present chairman of the de-
partment. |

A kindly man with white hair and |
an appealing personality, Dr. Stewart
has many interests. A great deal of |
his attention is focused on the fishes
and vertibrate animals of the Lewis-
burg area.

Nature Boy

His main reason for coming to
Bucknell and remaining here is that
it is an ideal location for ready access
to the wild life studied. He has pub-
lished a number of articles on these

s and parasites affecting them.
While on the committee of the State
Game Commission, he wrote an art
on the parasites of deer.

Dr. Stewart has a great interest in
oi] painting. Writing poetry also
ranks among I talents. Perhaps
you have noticed that Bucknell’s Cen-
tennial Song was composed by the
former music director Paul Stolz, who
wrote the m , and Dr. Stewart, who
wrote the words. Several of the
hymns we use in Chapel are the work
of Dr. Stewart also.

Canada Born

Born in Hamilton, Canada, Dr.
Stewart moved to Rochester, New
York, when a child, and there attend-
ed school with his five brothers and
one sister. The sum of his youth
were spent in the lakes and woods of
Canada. There he earned part of his
college expenses by guiding tourists.

Social Pro For Fraternities?

by Elaine Vouyoukas
Do you think fraternities should be deprived of their social privileges

because of marks?

Because last weekend seemed to be the last “open house” for far too

many of the fraternities on campus, for
ly question.

The Mike

by Jim Hastings
Once again your reporter found
many distractions to keep him away
from his studies—no not the Burger
or Chets, but the post-exam jubilee.

Following the grand finale, I faced
a crucial decision that many Buck-
nellians have to make, which one of
the many night-spots
would I attend to complete my even-
ing of entertainment. Because I was
utilizing the shoe leather express, it
was not difficult for me to notice the
palatial Seventh Avenue studios of
WVBU._ The flickering blue lights,
spelling out,our station’s call letters,
WVBU, (Would Virtue Be Universal)
proved to spell out entertainment that
put the jubilee’s skits to shame.

The head waiter ushered me to my
table just in time for the first act fea-
turing Jeff Thompson and Joan Olcott
in “Chatter Box.” The lights were

a while I thought this might be a time-

To be impartial and receive both
sides of the question, I asked first
the “SAMMYS” who are noted for

cholarship.

Bob Pincus, a Sammy well known
for giving advice, be it good or bad,
ays this: “Yes, I think they should
be penalized, but only for a short time.
In this way, the members with low
marks would have an incentive to
study harder and still not be discour-
aged so easily.”

Well that sounds practical, let’s
hope it will be practicable, if you
know what I mean!

Bobby Jones didn’t “know exactly
how to say it”, but I think she did
pretty well for not knowing how to
put it! She finally came up with this
rather realistic viewpoint: “There
should be some way to keep them at
their studies but not ne rily the
present method. ’Cuz if they can’t
go to open house, they just go to the
Burger and drown their troubles any-
way.”

Statistics have proven she is 99 and
one-half percent correct. Now who’s
the other one-half? Party poopers!

Craig Hall, one of the Kappa Sigs,
brought in some additional informa-
tion on the subject. He told us that:
“Y’d say yes because the present rules
and regulations have been set by the
I. F.C. Therefore, all fraternities
ought to abide by these rules. How-
ever, because of the draft, etc., lots
of students just don’t care.”

Also, unfortunately, in some cases
they (the students) would, if they
could, but they can’t!

Phy! Bell, a KKG, goes along with
Craig in stating her opinion. That
gal believes in settin’ your standards
and aimin’ for ’em, Which, believe
you me, is a smart thing to do!

Ph OW if they (the I. F
C.) set U | (the fraterni-
puld abide by them.” 7

The Big Purge

We were going to write an editorial about head chopping this
week until we found the letter in our mail that appears on the
right (Which Crisis?). We think that covers things pretty well.

It’s natural, of course, to start looking for ways to cut the
payroll when business starts dropping off. The only question in
our mind is should this cutting be done on the faculty. We think

Bucknell professors, never known to be overpaid, have auto-
matically become a little more than an instructor when they start
using Bucknell letter heads. They become a part of the Bucknell
Community, and take a quiet pride in this fact. Our professors
aren't just somebody you see in class every other day. They’re
people you go up to in Chet’s and talk with, or have over to the
house for Sunday dinner or to chaperone an open house.

Although it was obvious at once that this was not what the

commended for the manner in which they proceeded to correct
the situation. Its appeal to reason and its taste in refraining
from the use of threats was a credit to the students of that organi-
zation.

LAST MINUTE PROM DATA FROM THE ARROW ....
HOW TO GET A MAN AND ASSORTED TRIVIA

We repeat that prom-time is rolling around and with it the age-old strug-

| gle to dig up a date someplace, anyplace. Why it’s such a major operation I’ll

never know, but there you have it.

For those of you who have no hope of any clod looming on the horizon
there is that final (bless it!) resort-—Open House.

First and foremost, since appearance is unfortunately the first criteria of

ss, do dress the part you want to attract. That if you want the party
type, tie a big black bow sirenishly under your chin and dig up a moldy ole
beret someplace. If you want a blase man of the world drag out the taffetas
and rhinestones. Cashmeres, tweeds, and English walk will find you

ed by the sporty type (you might carry a ski pole f ded effect). If

you just want a good guy don a wool dress and shove the feets into opera
pumps...

Don’t sidle up and ooze in your target’s ear, “And what kind of girl are |

you looking for tonight?” They might (and probably will) give you one in-
credulous stare and go screaming out the door in mortal terror. I tell you
this through sad experience in hopes that you can retain self-respect and pre-
sent exalted opinion of self.

If OH turns out to be a complete failure we beg you to regre:
into the annals of old high or prep days. There must’ve been something, some-
time, we say hopefully, that you could coerce into lumbering down to Pitts-
burgh for a few moments of madness, we repeat hopefully.

Bowling Green, O.—(I. P.)—Job hunting students from Bowling Green
State University have been given a break. President Frank J. Prout an-
nounced here recently that, effective next year, Christmas and summer vaca-
tions will start earlier. In 1951-52 Christmas recess will begin Dec. 19 and
Commencement Will be May 30. Comparable dates this year are Dec. 21 and
June 8. Easter recess will continue to be from Thursday noon to Tuesday
morning.

The University Executive Committee has decided that freshmen will re-
port next Sept. 13 and classes will begin five days later. Most new students
will arrive on Thursday instead of the customary Sunday. The mid-year Com-

| mencement has been eliminated, effective in 1951-52.

Letters to the Editor

Which Crisis?

March 4, 1951
To the Editor: ‘

The Crisis in the University has
been fully discussed in the RILW just

dent was able to observe the discus-
sions were aimed at a general situa-
tion rather than a specific one. What
is the nature of the specific crisis we
all face here at Bucknell?

Squirl Squelched?

March 2, 1951
Dear Ed:

In response to the letter in last
week’s Bucknellian concerning the re-
vival of The Squirl, I should like to
give a few enlightening facts.

Last Fall a group of us who had
been connected with the old Squirl
called a meeting for all students in-
terested in reviving the magazine.
Upwards of 55 students attended this
meeting, after which a group of us
appointed a staff and assigned all the
students to the various departments.

We presented this list together
with our reorganization plan to the
Board of Publications. After a
series of meetings, the Board refused
us permission to restart the maga-
zine.

Their reasons were, among others,
that the magazine owed a large debt,
that the old magazine was obscene,
and that the material printed was un-
suited for a college publication.

As far as the first point is concern-
ed, the debt was contracted because
of a three-year contract signed on
May 28, 1947. The existence of this
contract was unknown to the Board.
If they, who determine which organi-
zations | publish, did not know of
the contract how was a group of stu-
dents to know of its being in effect.
How ter a series of letters be-
tween my and the advertising com-
pany to whom the money was owed,
they agreed to cancel the debt.

As for the second point, perhaps the
old Squirl was off color. Couldn’:
some punishment other than revoca-
tion of publication rights been inflict-
ed?

And the third point: the material
printed was unsuitable for a college
publication!

UNC FRATERNITIES RAISE STANDARDS

Chapel Hill, N. C._—(1. P.)—The Interfraternity Council at the University
of North Carolina recently recommended that no person be initiated into a
fraternity here unless he has an overall average of C. In order to improve
the scholastic standings of local fraternities, the council requested the Univer-
sity administration to change the present ruling which states that before initi-
ation the prospective member need have only half D’s and half C’s,

This move followed closely upon receipt of a report from the College Fra-

_ INFIRMARY BUSINESS BOOMS, FOWLE REPORTS —

Many Bucknellians seemed to have survived the winter weather without
any major accidents, but those poor unfortunates seen hobbling around campus
on crutches show that there are several who were not so lucky.

Along with treating these twenty
recent fractures, the infirmaries have
been kept busy this year with several
cases of cold and grip, a few requiring
confinement.

According to Dr. Lester P. Fowle,
the infirmary is now able to cure such
ills as gyip and strep throat in a few
days. Years ago, prior to the use of
the sulpha drugs and antibiotics, two

statements of opinion about pacific-
ism. This is strictly one individual’s
opinion and does not necessarily re-
flect the opinion of the Bucknellian or
myself.

Pacificism, according to Webster's
Dictionary, is an opposition to war or
to the use of military force for any
reason. A pacifist is a person¢who
has a mental attitude opposing all
war and advocating settlement of in-
ternational disputes entirely by arbi-
tration. I hardly think in these cru-
cial times, that we, as American citi-
zens, can afford to be pacifists. To
stand up against aggressive distator-
ships, a democracy must Have a
strong, passionate belief in its rights
and, if necessary, fight to preserve
"those rights.

Wolf And Lamb Fable

The old fable about the wolf and
the lamb illustrates this particular
viewpoint. Put a new slant on this
story and maybe you'll see the con-
nection. One day a wolf went tc
drink at a small stream in the woods.
At the same time, a lamb was drink-
ing at the same stream further up-
stream. The wolf*complained to the

Behind Village Reporter Pays Tribute To

The Mike

by Jim Hastings
Just for curiosity, I wonder how
many students have really thought
why Bucknell has a radio station.
When radio became prominent follow-
ing the First World War, it was rec-
ognized by educators as a new medium
of education for students and the gen-
eral public. Many colleges owned
licensed stations but soon found com-
mercial stations, financed by nation-
wide advertisers, an overwhelming
competitor. Also the universities
found their stations too expensive or
a waste of time and mor
The purpose of radi

cording to
the masses, is to amu

, entertain,
and soothe, not to instruct, preach,
and inform. It seems to me that
radio has lost much of its educational
value. Just think, here on our own
campus, WVBU could broadcast your
eight o’clock classes via lecture over
the radio. When the clock on the hill
chimes eight times, all you would have
to do it roll over in your bunk, turn
on the radio, and let the prof’s voice
ring. out. Radio has one

Bucknell Memories And Traditions

by Bill Wakefield

3y next August, 19 of us shall have
graduated. The war service of this
group occurred at the time when the
fighting was the
toughest. Their
tales relate experi-
ences from the air-
borne invasion of
Germany to the as-
sault of bloody
beaches in the Pa-
cific,

Without the GI
Bill, many of us
never would have completed college.
World War II vets have served as
“scholastic guinea pigs” in a mass ex-
periment of Federal aid to higher ed-
ucation. We’re glad to know that
Bucknell thinks we did all right. Ac-
cording to the following quote from
December’s Alumnus, we at Bucknell
must have been pretty good pigs:

Bill Wakefield

“Those of us with long memories
recall the time when college faculties
were inclined to view’ with alarm the
incoming of the GI students. Fears
were widespread throughout the col-
lege world that they would be indiffer-
ent students; that, a
adult role in lif

Family of the Week

Jim and Mary Holmes have lived in
the Village longer than any other
couple now here. They’re our “old-
timers,” and they’ve seen a lot of Vil-
lagers come and go in three years.

When Jim and Mary came to the V.
in Februa 1948, their daughter,
Jamie, was just a two-year-old little
girl. Now she’s a pretty, young
lady who seems to be growing up
faster than her parents like to think.
But as Jamie gets older, there’s a
little one-year-old brother to follow
close by. Rosy cheeks, flashing eyes,
a big bashful grin—supported by an
abundance of, activity—that’s brother
Duane.

The Holmes are natives of Wil-
liamsport, where they started dating
in high school. After graduation Jim
went into the Navy for over 4 years.
Late in 1943 Mary decided to join the
man of her choice permanently; she
married her sailor and happily went
with him where

With silica, water and imagination
Du Pont scientists have found

How to Tame Slippery Floors

Teen-agers in high schools used to
have great, if hazardous, fun running
and sliding on newly waxed corridor
floors. Of late many of them haven’t
been able to do that. For numerous
schools, as well as office buildings
and institutions, are now using waxes
that have been made skid-resistant.

The product that is taming slip-
pery floors is ‘“Ludox” colloidal silica
—adapted by Du Pont chemists to
floor wax through cooperative re-
search with the wax industry.

If you mix plain sand with floor
wax, you'll have an anti-slip surface,
but it would be unsightly and thor-
oughly impractical. With “Ludox,”
you are using a water suspension of
invisible colloidal silica particles less
than a millionth of an inch in diam-
eter.

A problem child

“Ludox” was quite a problem child
to scientists who developed it. For
instance, research men had to know
how silica would act in the presence
of floor wax. So they turned to the
electron microscope and learned that
the little silica spheres attach them-
selves firmly to the surfaces of wax
spheres five times their size.

But it was also necessary to find
out how “‘Ludox” affects a waxy film

“Lydox" particles (dark, in this electron Photo-

throughout depth of film. Magnified 25,000 x.

as well as safer. Other wax qualities—gloss,
freeze- and water-resistance, leveling—are un-
affected. It is now used by many manufacturers.

after it is laid down on a floor. While
a polished waxed floor looks smooth
enough, it is actually a series of hills
and valleys and these irregularities
have an important bearing on the
behavior of a surface.

Working with a waxed surface pre-
sented difficulties. The electron mi-
croscope functions only if electron
beams can pass through the mem-
brane upon which the specimen is
placed. And electrons can’t “‘see
through’”’ a floor!

Study in duplication
Often, problems like this have been
solved by preparing a thin replica or
copy of the surface for examination
in its stead. However, the conven-
tional method for making a replica—

the one frequently used in studying
metals—requires solvents. These
would dissolveandruina waxsurface.

So it became necessary for the
chemists and electron microscopists
to develop an entirely new way to
make a replica of a surface. This they
did, as part of a research program
that lasted several years.

With it some remarkable pictures
were made. They showed that many
““Ludox’’ particles stay at the sur-
face of a wax film, even though they
are denser than wax. As you walk on
a floor, your shoe presses the tiny
silica particles down into the wax
spheres that make up the film. This
sets up a snubbing action which keeps
you from slipping.

Much more could be told about
Du Pont research on colloidal silica.
For example, chemical and mechan-
ical engineers had to develop manu-
facturing equipment, including a spe-
cially designed ion exchange column.
Organic and physical chemists used
research findings to formulate better
waxes, as well as silica-containing
adhesives and anti-slip treatments
for rayon fabrics. Like practically all
Du Pont achievements, “Ludox”’ is
the result of close, continuous team-
work of men and women trained in
many fields of science.

DID YOU KNOW...

it costs more than $10,000 on the average to
provide the tools, machines, factory space
and working capital for an American worker.
Du Pont’s average operating investment per
employee is $17,800.

ROBERTS HALL SCENE

OF CPAA ART EXHIBIT

A great variety of technique and
mood was evident in the art exhibit
held in Roberts Hall last Sunday af-
ternoon under the auspices of the
Central Pennsylvania Art Association.

Particularly impressive were “At
the Edge of the Forest,” by Elanor
Zyler of State College, and a water-
color, “Off the ‘L’” by Yar Chomicky
of Bellefonte. There were many more
equally impressive paintings, ranging
in size. from a gigantic seascape to
a miniature still life.

Among the most exceptional paint-
ings was the subtle “Stil] Life With
Watermelon,” by Professor Gummo,
Bruce Mitchell’s vivacious “New Ber.
li,” “Beach Scene,” a watercolor by
George Irland, professor of electrical
engineering.

Bruce Mitchell, artist-in-residence,
lectured on art consciousness in Penn-
sylvania.

Letters To The Editor |

In The Dark

To the Editor:

We write this in an attempt to in-
form the trustees that we, a represen-
tative group of students, should like
to know “what the score is” on the
recent cut back of the faculty.

Since we, the students, are the rea-
sons or which this university was es-
tablished, and especially since the
cost of our education has been raised
considerably for next year, we think
we have the right to know the reason-
ing behind the trustee’s altering of
the faculty.

We feel that had the students been
first consulted, different changes
would have been made.

Very sincerely,
The Women’s Glee Club

The Biggest Victory

To the Editor:

In the past weeks articles have ap-
peared in the “Letters to the Editor”
column concerning various basketball
players.

It is a pleasure to report that I have
received favorable comments from
several athletic directors of our op-
ponents as well as one of the college
presidents.

The following letter, written to one
of our students, came to my desk last
week and I have asked his permission

March 1, 1951
Dear Sir:
I thought that when I witnessed the

| Bucknell-Gettysburg game at Lewis-

burg, I had seen everything. But last
night topped even that.

Of course, we are proud of Belber
and our whole team, but everywhere
I have gone today, people were talking
about the player, number 13, on the
Bucknell team!

So, f you want to call it such, I am
writing a “fan” letter. I hardly know
where to draw the line but 13, 11, Des
15, and 7 can all get up and take a
bow.

Please be assured that as long as
the audience of last night’s game live,
they will ‘consider the Bucknell team
of 1950-51 probably the greatest
group of opponents Gettysburg Col-
lege has ever had.

If you ever find yourself in o1
around Gettysburg College, drop by
the President’s office (my home-plate)
and you will be treated to the best
dinner the town has to offer and a
trip over the battlefield.

With every good wish, I am

natures of 78 members of the Women’s
Glee Club. In order to save space,
they are not printed here.

To The Editor:

week one of the Bucknellian’s
editorials ended with “ let’s count
noses in Old Main.” Why count noses
in Old Main; w y try to save man-
hours in the maintenance department;
why strive for any improvement at all,
as long as mid-Victorian traditional-
ism is the Bucknell way of life?

Just what are the objectives of
Bucknell ? Page thirty-seven of the
newest catalog lists such things as
“... honest and inquiring mental at-
titude, ability to observe accurately,
think logically and apply fundamental
principles to he solution of problems
in any general situations.” Construg-
tive cooperation, worthwhile goals,
initiative, and comprehension are also
set forth as objectives, Does the Ad-
ministration expect these objectives to
be furthered by getting rid of some of
the best minds on the faculty?

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests

Number 14... THE BEAVER

“How eager
can they get?”

oe once in his life, our fervent friend admits that
eagerness can be over-done! He’s alluding, of course, to all
these quick-trick cigarette tests—the ones that ask you to decide on cigarette
mildness after just one puff, one sniff, one inhale or one exhale! When the
chips are down, he realizes cigarette mildness can’t
be judged in a hurry. That’s why he made . .
The sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test
which asks you to try Camels as your steady smoke—
on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap
judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels—and only
Camels—for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for Throat,

T for Taste), we believe you'll know why...

THURSDAY, MARCH 15, 1954,

Opinion Is That Less Grass Cutting
Might Make For Less Class Cutting

Do you think the administration should endeavor to budget expenses by
cutting down on “extras” or reducing staff members?

Well, your faithful reporter has con-9

formed to a popular fad currently on
campus commonly known as “crutch-
itis”. No, I wasn’t run over by a
truck—it all started with the Kappa
Sig band—but that’s another story
and I won’t bore you with the gory
details—on with the question of the
week.

The Phi Gam House hands down a
one-sentence edict by way of Don
DeaRyne.

He says, and I quote with his kind
permission: “There are too few pro-
fessors as it is and the administration
should cut down on maintenance men
and janitors.”

Tell me, have you seen any extra
maintenance men running around
lately ?

A very wary SPE who wouldn’t give
his name said: “Cut down on the lux-
uries—‘rakers’.”

Can’t you see dear old Bucknell
overflowing ‘with unraked leaves?
Let’s not get carried away with the
spirit of the thing!

Mimi Haas, an Alpha Phi, who is
a staunch advocator of Bucknell says:
“There’s a lot more places to cut down
than on the faculty. Bucknell is a
terrific university, you would lower its
standing by reducing staff members—
“Do we really need the grounds cut
so frequently?”

Well, ral round, all you Bucknell
fans! Clearly, something must be
done!

John Harvey, a well known, and
may I add, a well-liked Phi Psi ap-
proached the subject from another
angle.

He mused awhile, then said: “Make
a few economies elsewhere than the

Russ Thacher ’41 has written a war
novel, “The Captain”, which will be
published by the MacMillan Company
in late April.

When Russ attended Bucknell, he
majored in English, wrote for The
Bucknellian, edited the L’Agenda and
was a member of the Board of Publi-
cations. After graduation, he was
sent to the Pacific with the Navy.
Russ is now working on the editoria!

Village V oice

by Bill Wakefield

With the recent ending of the Inde-
pendent League schedule, the Village
basktball team posted a record of 2
wins and 4 losses. Not too good a

record, it is true,
but the games pro-
vided pienty of fun
and exercise. Play-
ing manager Ralph
Webster reports
that on more than
one occasion ke}
players were kept

Bill Wakefield at home to baby sit
while Mamma went out for the even-
ing. Eh, Gads—the headaches of a
coach with a group of “old married
men!”

Team members were: Peters, An-
drews, Anderson, Lloyd, Selner, Shar-
adin, Butscher, Ogan, Felcher, Bloy,
and Clothier. High-point man was
Bill Andrews.

From The Horses Mouth

Official word has been passed along
that there will be no toleration of (1)
parking cars on the grass and (2)
keeping of pets. Only comment: “A

made a lot of friends since they came
to the Village in February of 50. In
view of the good record already made
at Bucknell by their Daddy and two
uncles, it’s almost certain they, too,
will be Bucknellians in the 1960’s.

Curt, a real student who averages
19 hours each semester, is from Green-

Theater Guild and the Junior Civic

nothing wrong with blind dates
That’s how they met.

The Ivey’s lived in Conn. for over
a year before coming to Bucknell.
Since becoming a “college family
they’ve very successfully been able to
make ends meet, but we marvel at
thir accomplishment. One thing we
know: There’s a “heap o’ success
brewing for this diligent family, for
they know that an ounce of sacrifice
today is worth a pound of reward to-
morrow.

75 YEARS OF TELEPHONE SERVICE

On the evening of March 10, 1876,
on the top floor of a boarding house in
Boston, the telephone carried its first
intelligible sentence.

It seemed like a miracle to our
grandparents and great-grandparents.
Yet today, the telephone is a part of
our everyday living. And that is the
real miracle —the fact that the tele-
phone has come to mean so much to so
many people in so many ways.

Never in the

BELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM (

The telephone is an indispensable
tool of business and government — to-
day’s tremendous job of production
and defense could not be carried on
without it. It serves in minor emer-
gencies and great ones. It helps main-
tain family and community ties. And it
keeps right on growing and improving.

history of the tele-

phone has it been so valuable to so
many people as right now.

Publicity,
Student Faculty, Student Directorship
and Student Administration.

Reporting for the
tee, chairman Ann Cooper said that it
has nt questionnaires to approxi
mately a hundred schools. Thirty-
five schools that have a successful
honor
others with unsuccessful
yet to answer. Each school has dif-
ferent methods of reporting and pun-
ishing which might be used here, de-
pending on the opinions of the stu-
dents.

Bob Laub and Sally Hitchens head
the Student Directorship Committee
which works directly with the student
body. Bob Laub stated that the most
important task is to educate the stu-
dent body by means of the grapevine,
by a pamphlet with questions and an-
sSwers, now in proce and by having
speakers come and explain various
methods used. By these means he
hopes the students will be persuaded
to accpt the academic honor system.

The Student Faculty committee
headed by Jack Maeby and Sylvia
Harbaugh bridges the gap between the
faculty and students. They have
polled about half of the faculty and
found it overwhelmingly in favor of
such a system, though most faculty
members added the impetus should
come from the students.

Ronald Unger, chairman of Student
Administration, serves as a link be-
tween administration and students.
“President Hildreth is in favor of a
system and he feels it must come from
the students. When the students can
prove it will work at Bucknell, we will
get the support of the administra-
tion,” Unger said.

Bucknell, Miss Hyatt said, would
only want such a system under cer-
tain circumstances. If the students
decide that they wish to eliminate
cheating, and be recognized as a re-
sponsible student group with a higher
attitude toward education; if the fac-
ulty wish better student relationships
and less unpleasant proctoring; if all
concerned Wish better prestige for our
school, then we want the honor
tem, she said.

But, she said, the honor system is
not an automatic thing. It must be
instated by a group of students who
feel the need of a higher mode of
conduct. Her closing comment was:

The sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,

which simply asks you to try Camels as a steady smoke — on

Frosh Hazing } Next Year?

by Elaine Vouyoukas

Should freshman “hazing” be re-
established next year?

Now that thoughts of “moving up
day” are coming into view, many of
the prospective sophomores are con-
templating the initiation of next
year’s frosh class by various rites
and ordeals before they can be con-
sidered Bucknellians. Some
students, upperclassmen and surpris-
freshmen were
rather disgusted with this year’s lack

Holton Confer, Kappa Sig, doesn’t
have this fiendish desire to initiate
new frosh.

He said and I quote: “I sort of
think we céuld do without hazing. I
wouldn’t like it, so I don’t think they
would either.”

Bob Birnbaum foom his lofty exalt-
ed position as a junior, gives his
opinion. Because he never really
went through hazing either, I asked
him what he thought of the past two

He reflected awhile, then said: “If
‘hazing’ would further school spirit

years, all fine and dandy.”

She says: “The classes get to know

Transfer Milly Martin Coaches

May Day Modern Dance Group

by Ann Rose
Since it was founded, Bucknell has contributed many illustrious people to

society, and once more a talented student has come here to study.

She is Milty

Martin, a senior transfer from the University of Maryland.

Milly has many talents, but her
main interest is modern dancing and
she certainly excels in this field. She
has been in the companies of such
celebraties as Martha Graham, Ted
Shawn, and Ruth St. Dennis.

Milly has been dancing ever since
she was seven, and at the age of fif-
teen became one of Martha Graham’s
three apprentices at the Kings Smith
School in Washington, D. C. After
graduation from high school she at-
tended St. Mary’s Jr. College and
then transferred to the University of
Maryland where she was a
major

speech

She became a professional dancer
at Maryland, and also began to do
choreography with the dancers there.
This is now her first interest, as she
did all the choreography for Fred
Waring’s Christmas show this year,

Jacob’s Dance Festival in Pittsfield,
Mass., where the best dancers in the
world go to practice in the summer.
It was here that she worked under
Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Dennis, and
was the soloist for Martha Graham’s
company. However, she broke her
pelvic bone and had to stop dancing
for a year. She has had several of-
fers as choreographer for different
shows after her graduation, and some
day she plans to have a show of her
own.

Script Rewritten

Under the direction of Harvey
Powers with Janie Brown as assistant
director, the show was especially re-
written to take place in present-day
Paris. Some Bucknellians may have
seen a reworked 1904 version of Mlle.
Modiste on T. V. over mid-semester
vacation, starring Fritzie Scheff, the
original lead of the first poduction,
but this was worked over to feature
Miss Scheff, and in no way compares
with the original to be presented by
the Players.

Runs Hatshop

The story, with Margie Monzert in
the lead, is centered around a Parisian
hat shop, and features elaborate cos-
tumes, and props.

Miss Monzert, a pert hatshop pro-
prietress, is the only one who dares
stand up to the count, captivating him
and a troop of French soldiers, and
finally becoming the sweetheart of
French society.

The aforementioned count, played
by Bramley Billipp, is a gaudy in-
ebriate, with an overfondness for the
fair sex.

Confused Captain

A dashing young captain, Dave
Norwine is one of the male leads who
can’t ever find the time, the place and
the girl all at once.

Betty Clark, as Mrs. Brent, and Mr.
Bent (in reality Bob Birnbaum) are
two ‘feelthy reech’ American tourists
in Paris.

A dapper young artist’s son, who
spends his mother’s money like water,
is a miserable painter, and a worse
lover is played by Jim Stanton, who
sings the striking solo, ‘Ze Engleesh
Language’...

Oooh la-la!

The Modern Dance Group will pre-
sent their version of the dancers of
the Follies Bergere, led by Lee Fiefer,

THE BUCKNELLIAN

THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 1951.

The Nation’s Finest?

Last week one of our editorials, in commenting on the na-..

tion’s new policy of draft deferments for college students, men-
tioned that perhaps we shouldn’t question this new Congress-
given right of ours to persue our education whilst our unlearned
brothers were sweating out the Korean thing.

But with every tabloid in the country shrieking the order’s
ramifications we felt we might, at this point, add our own small

ry, knowing that in all probability it will not reach farther than,
say, 300 acres.

The most obvious fault of the plan, of course, is its assump-
tion that every male with a high school diploma and an IQ of 110
is enrolled in one of the nation’s universities. This is not the case
of course. It is generally conceded that only families with an
upper-middle class income are in a position to finance four years
of college. Mr. Benjamin Fine of the eminent New York Times
reports that for every man in college, another of equal ability is
unable to attend, mostly because of financial reasons.

This explains why the more radical reviewers of this law are
quick to suggest that our legislators are making a privileged
class of those of us fortunate enough to be in college.

Some educators are prone to argue that the law is worth-
while by virtue of its saving from military service the men who
are genuinely concerned with getting a higher education. These
students, it is pointed out, are the future scientists, engineers and
leaders in the business field.

We would answer that by recalling the education boom
caused by the returning veterans of World War II. The men
who really wanted an education, it will be remembered, managed
to get one even though they were a little older than the average
campus man And statistics tell us that in most cases the vet-
eran was better equipped to receive. college training.

Even though the new policy may seem heaven-sent to the
draft harassed Bucknell eligibles, we doubt if many agree whole-
heartedly with the principle of it.

Wherein Evidence Is Offered In
Support Of Argument Concerning
Change Of Seasons

At the risk of getting hammy, we'll go out on a limb this
week by pointing out that the voice of the turtle has been heard
on our campus.

How do we know?

It’s difficult to say just when we got our first clue, although
we strongly suspect it was that day in the club house when
Harold Evans, the golf pro, made his appearance in the first of
what is sure to be a long series of odd looking golf hats.

maybe it was just the nostalgic

to the Editor

More On{(Crisis

Dear Mr. Editor:

For the better portion of five weeks,
| Bucknell’s CRISIS has floundered in
a hubub of charges, and  counter-
charges which have served primarily
to stimulate indignation, create con-

on and yet to arouse the latent

of Bucknellian’s to maintain

our University at a high plane of
thought and action. This letter is
written in the hope that Bucknell will
respond to the myriad problem in a
manner which will bring to the fore
| this latent avidness.

It has been clearly pointed out in
| the Letter’s to the Editor, President
Hildreth’s statement, and in the Buck-
|nellian Editorials that this school is
(seca with a CRISIS. Thus far, the
| CRISIS has been presented as an
| economic depletion—the answer has
| been a defense of faculty in terms
| primarily of personality. The prob-
| lem that faces Bucknell is a focal one
} in the University’s historical milieu.
| It is far deeper than merely economic
; woes and certainly transcends the
| realm of individual personalities.
| We Bucknellians are face to face

with the dynamic problems “For |

What Does a University Stand?”, and
“What does a University Mean in
| Terms of Those Who Are Part of it—
|THE STUDENTS, THE FACULTY
;AND THE ADMINISTRATION.”
| We believe that a University is a
| community—a community of interests
| if you will—which has two integral
| parts—THE STUDENTS AND THE
| TEACHERS,

It is the duty of the Administration
| to insure that the optimum value is
jgained and maintained in Student-
Teacher relationships. Because as
Americans, as maturing men and
; Women, and as citizens of a larger
world, we the students are in dire
| need of developimg our abilities to the
farthest extent possible. Bucknell
has always stood! for this type of de-
velopment through the maintenance

| of a low ratio of students to teachers, |

because only through the intimate
| face-to-face relationship so procured
can an individual properly ascertain
and use the tools of a school of higher
learning.

Schloo Says, ‘No Schmoo’

April 7,. 1951
To The Editor:
Dear Sir:

In the last issue of the BUCK-
NELLIAN, the music column “AS
THE CAT SEES THEM” was rather
harshly criticized in a letter to the
editor for its alleged use of (1) coined
words and (2) vulgarity.

In answering these charges, the
Cat has asked me to reply (1) that
the column is not written for squares
and (2) that Horace Greeley once
said “A narrow mind is the essence
of vulgarity.”

Sincerely,.
Herb Schloo

Another Winchell?

Lewisburg,. Pa,
Dear Editor:

Miss Howard had quite a lot to say
last week about musicolumnist (sic)
Herb (“The Cat”) Schloo,. none of it
pleasant. Her main objection seems
to be against his coined’ words, I
would remind her that coined words
may be found in “Time”, Winchell’s
daily column, and in the record re-
views in “Metronome”, from which I
| quote at random: “Side has a Lunce-
fordish flavor”........“Rasping Anthony
j trumpet, piping Millerish saxes........”
and so om

Re his so-called “vulgarisms’”:

stardized Miller” is an excellent

riptive phrase for a musical style
which is little better than a poor imi-
tation of Glenn Miller. Jazz record
review writing is all in a terse, des-
criptive vein similar to The Cat’s and
!“vulgarisms” are often resorted to. I
fhesitate to discuss criteria, since I
don’t know what criteria any record
| reviewer uses, other than his enjoy-
| ment or dislike of the record in ques-
tion.

“The Cat’s style is definitely idio-

cording to Dogpatch standards at the
WAA’s Sadie Hawkins dance last Fri-

fashion plate’s dictates. Some of the
snappier numbers to be seen were
elegant burlap creatiofs, evquisitely
mutilated dungarees and plaid shirts,
and the perrenially popular feminine
attire if peasant blouses and bright
skirts.

Many of the men were favored by
presents from their dates in the form
of vegetable corsages.

After the ball closed, promptly on
the stroke of midnight, one sage old
matron was heard to coo, ’H’it sure
were a ball, warn’t it?’

CCNY PAPER DROPPED FOR INSULTING PREXY

‘The Campus”, City College of New York under-graduate newspaper, was
| suspended last week by a committee of faculty members for “insulting the «

The unprecedented move was taken without the knowledge of President
| Harry W. Wright who was traveling in the midwest and did not see the issue
of April 2. The suspension is subject to Dr, Wright’s approval‘ when he

mittee has the authority to take disciplinary action.
Lester M. Nichols, assistant to President Wright, said that the April 2

edition was “unbecoming to a college newspaper” and criticized the alleged
insult as “bad taste.”

Bill Wakefield have recently been
spending unwelcome days in bed.
Arthur and Skeeter Ivey underwent

accepted a position as secretary to
the vice president of the New York
Central Railroad, and will begin. work
in New York City on May 1. The
Featherstone’s have accepted a splen-
did opportunity, and we wish them

Seven-thirty last Thursday morn-
ing found twenty of Mr. Groover’s
Economics 2 students in Chet’s,

downing a hasty cup of coffee before
embarking on a field trip to the State
Capitol at Harrisburg. Mr. Groover
arranged the trip so that the class,
which is studying the organization
and functions of governmental agen-
cies and commissions, would have an
opportunity to observe the operation
of these agencies and commissions at
close range.

The trip was highlighted by a per-
sonal interview with Mr. Charles R.
Barber, Secretary of the State Tre
ury, and by an inspection of the treas-
ury vault, which at the present time
contains over eight hundred million
dollars in negotiable securities.

Before lunch the class found time
to visit briefly the State Law Library,
the State General Library, the State
Museum, the famous Pennsylvania
State Forum, and the House and
Senate assembly rooms in the Main

break for lunch, the class assembled

by Jim Hastings

Your Radio Workshop has added a
new personality to its list of outstand-
ing radio celebraties. His name is
Mel Strong, a senior, and a member
of Kappa Sigma fraternity! ‘Mel be-
came interested in having his own
radio show which he has _ éntitled
COLLECTOR’S CORNER after hav-
ing taken a course from Mr. Ewing
in radio script writing.
. Mel conceived the idea for his pro-
gram consisting of present-and-past-
popular collector’s items from his
long established desire for ‘concert

| jazz’ and ‘old favorite’ recordings.

This currently featured show may be
heard over WVBU every Wednesday
evening from 8:30 until 9:30.

At present, Mel is featuring fav-
orite records by Woody Herman,
Benny Goodwin and his magic clari-

| net, and Stan Kenton, all outstanding

artists among collegiate groups.
From the general reaction about cam-

;pus, COLLECTOR’S CORNER has

not only managed to hold its own

| among the older shows, but has shown

a marked popularity for a new pro-
gram.
Dise Jockey’s Problems

But just like everything else in this
world, this disc jockey, too, is having
his . problems As a steady listener
to the music and news station you
may be able to help Mel, for if you
possess or even know anyone that
owns an album or two of collector
item recordings just give him a call
at 2700. Even one or two records
would help. Your disc jockey has
promised a “double-your-record-back”
guarantee if your discs aren’t return-
ed promptly and in good condition.

Now that you have a chance to help
your station, what do you say tha

HOW TO GET THAT “A”

1. Bring the teacher newspaper clippings dealing with his subject. Thig
| demonstrates fiery interest and gives him timely items to mention to the class.
| If you can’t find clippings déaling with his subject, bring in any clippings. He
thinks everything deals with his subject.
| 2. Look alert. Take notes eagerly.
| stare at it unbelievingly and shake it.

3. Nod frequently and murmur, “How true,” To you this seems exag-
| gerated. To him, it’s quite objective.
| 4. Sit in front of him. (Applies only if you intend to stay awake). If
| you are going to all the trouble of making a good impression, you might as
| well let him know who you are, especially if it is a large class.

5. Laugh at his jokes. You can tell. If he looks up from his notes and
smiles expectantly, he has told a joke.

6. Ask for outside reading. You don’t have to read it. Just ask,

7. If you must sleep, arrange to be called at the end of the hour. It
creates an unfavorable impression if the rest of the class has left and you sit
there, dozing.

8. Be sure the book you read during the class looks like a text book.
Match books for size and color.

9. Ask any questions you thnk he can answer. Conversely, avoid an-
| nouncing that you have found the answer to a question he couldn’t answer, and
| in your brother’s third grade reader at that.

| life-and-death dilemma. It has its choice of either cleaning up the magazine
| or discontinuing publication.

Pressure from various groups on and off the campus have initiated a
“clean-up” campaign, designed to revolutionize the content of the magazine.

The Christmas issue of the magazine has been called especially offensive.
Other humor magazines in Iowa are having similar troubles. Magazines

| Amherst, Mass.—(I. P.)—Freshman coeds at the University of Massa-
| chusetts chafed a bit last September when Monday through Thursday were set
aside as “Study Nights,” and a 7 p. m. curfew on outside campus activities was
imposed until December. Dean of Women Helen Curtis now reports that
177% of all freshmen girls achieved an average higher than 70% in Dean’s
progress reports. Moreover, 22%, more than one-fifth of all freshman girls,
| had “Dean’s list” (honor grades)—over 80.
“This shows that the freshman girls have made a good start in college
| studies,” Dean Curtis said, adding that the curfew program was deemed a
success. The freshmen who achieved grades higher than 70 may now partici-
pate in extra-curricular activities at their discretion.

This conclusion comes frim Professir Homer J. L. Carter and Miss Doro-

ig thy McGinnis, of Western Michigan college. They recently finished a study

which show conclusively that school marks and the estimate of scholarship

.| ability by the high school principle are reliable bases for predicting the calibre

of academic work at the college level.
Other factors which hinge on college success are: the number of books and
periodicals read during the senior year in high school: language skills.
Successful Gal
Here is a further description of the talented 19-year-old girl who is almost
| certain to be a success: She has made a definite vocational choice; she claims
to have read five books and six periodicals during her senior year; she has fail-
ed no high school courses and has taken quite a bit of math.
The person most likely to fail in college is a young man of tw enty who had
a C average in high school. He has as yet made no vocational choi
accepted in college on condition and does not re-enter next semester.

College Testing Plans Remain
Unimpaired In Spite Of House
Amendment To The Draft Bill

Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Director 6f Sele of Selective Service, said in a speech Sun-
day night that a House amendment to the manpower draft bill stating that
draft boards were not to be bound by the results of aptitude tests “in no way
impairs our plans for giving aptitude tests to college students and using the

scores,’
“The amendment,” he said,
recognizes a state of affairs that al-

ready has existed—that the ultimate 3

decision as to whether a man should
or should not be drafted rests with his
local draft board.”

The Selective Service head also
stated that the induction of college
men would be delayed _ this
until thei

spring
and scholastic
srmined. Stu-
y or higher in
the upper
y receive an
occupati deferment in order to
permit education to
next fall.
No One Denied Test
“Generally speaking,” General Her.
shey id, “no student will be denied
permission to take the test because of
his draft board status. He will not
be ordered into service until the re-
sults of his test are known-or his
standing in his class is determined.

continu

The draft administrator said that
aptitude tests qualifying college stu-
dents for deferment on the basis of
their grades will be repeated at peri-
odie intervals.

So far, only three dates for such
tests have been announced—May 26,
June 16 and June 30.

Reservists Safe

This came on the heels of a De-
fense Department announcement stat-
ing that no more inactive Army or
Air Force Reservists will be called to
active duty against their wishes un-
less there is a “significant” change
in military manpower needs.

Inactive Naval Reservists, it said,
will be ordered to duty only when
active reservists are not available or
when some special skill is needed.

These plans were disclosed in a
letter from Assistant Defense Secre-
tary Anna Rosenberg which was read
on the House floor by Rep. Overton
Brooks (D., La.) during debate on the
draft bill.

Test Movies’ Value To
Carb Racial Prejudices

The Sociology Departments of
Bucknell and Penn State held an ex-
periment on the value of motion pie-
tures in curbing racial prejudice last
Thursday at 2:30 in the Lit Building.

A group of students were given two
tests in order to determine what facts
they knew about the racial situation
in the United States and’ to determine
their conception of Negroes.

Then a half-hour movie presenting
the true facts was shown to the stu-
dents. Following the film, a third
test was given to see if the opinions
and ideas had changed.

The results of this experiment will
be used to help establish a form for
judging the effect of movies on racial
prejudice.

“The Greatest Of Generals Was Douglas’’

. . . So saith one of the many sundry epigrams on Douglas
MacArthur to come out of World War II. This particular ballad
goes on to point out some of the various inconsistencies of this
famous personality, dwelling for the most part on the general’s
habit of designing his own uniforms, and climaxing with the sum-
mation that Douglas is, after all, a vain man.

We mention this, of course, in connection with MacArthur’s
recent expulsion from the Far East, and to say that from the
standpoint of a jumpy citizen we are glad the voters are going
to have something to say about future policy in that area.

The flood of emotionalism being harnassed by eager politic-
ians in Washington does not conceal the fact that, his brilliance
in guiding Japan’s reconstruction notwithstanding, Dugout was
too much of an individual, too long a supreme commander to take
orders that conflicted with his own military theories.

MacArthur, it must be remembered, was responsible to him-

Truman is responsible to the voters.

We're afraid that in this case we must stand up and be count-

ed with Truman, bumptious buffoon though he is.

About This Honor System. . .

Now about all this noise we’ve been hearing about a scholas-
tic honor system. We don’t think there’s any doubt but that an
honor system would help Bucknell, both in prestige off campus
and as a healthy influence on campus.

\ |
Sp ¥
A —— \ I have been a rather greedy con-

| sumer of the “Student Voice of Buck-
| nell” for the last three years. It has
|taken three years and a course in
| Bio, 100 to show me that everything
| I consumed was not healthy for the
| body. I shall comment only upon the
| more digestible tid-bits appearing in
| the “Student Voice.”

In my freshman year, the most de-
| sirable features of the “Voice” were
the editorials, the letters to the editor,
}and the opinionated column “World
| Wide.” As a sophomore, I found the
| editorializing slightly on the decline;
| the letters to the editor in a pathetic
| state of being; and only the column
| “World Wide” gave me any food for
| thought.

This year, I have enjoyed the edi-
| torials immensely; and the letters to
| the editor have for the most part,
| been quite stimulating. The only
thing lacking is an opinionated col-
umn similar to “World Wide.”

Why not reinstate such a column
| So that we may not lose sight of the
|national and _ international scene
| which is of vital concern to all of us?
| Sincerely,

John Harmon

To the Editor:

Sara Angle ’50, Chairman of the
University Theatre Fund, is happy to
announce the recent appointment of
a Board of Trustees to the Fund and
Advisors to the Theatre Committee,
These men have responded enthusi-
astically to support this student en-
deavor, a University Theatre, and we
are very grateful to them for their
spirit of cooperation. This Board in-
cludes Joseph W. Henderson, Horace
A. Hildreth, Jens Fredrick Larson,
Dayton L. Ranck, Herbert L. Spen-
cer, Kenneth W. Slifer and Donald B,
Young.

To our new Board, to the Class of
1950, to the Bucknell Mothers’ Asso-
ciation, and to other friends of the
theatre, we owe our deepest appre-
ciation; for they, in one way or an-
other, have recognized a need for a
Bucknell Theatre and have willingly
and generously contributed toward its
realization. To all who have helped
or will help us we wish to express
our thanks.

Set For W eekend

With the parting of the curtain at
8:15 tomorrow and Saturday nights,
at the Lewisburg High School, a 50-
year old tradition will be carried on
as Delta Upsilon fraternity performs
before the students and townfolk
with their production of “Lunatics at
Large” by James Beach.

As the name implies, lunatics in a
mental home have a leading part in
developing the plot which results. in
the murder of the arch villain. The
police inspector who is sent to the
scene of the crime is not quite capable
of outwitting the criminal, but, need-
less to say, the culprit is brought to
justice after numerous vexing com-
plications present themselves.

James Clitter is directing the play
with the assistance of Professor
Frank Merritt. Those in the cast
are: Bob Kerr, Stan Lippencott, Bob
Catherman, George Shepherd, John
McFadden, Bub Bretz, Bob Dederer,
Fred Wolf, Fred Hunt, Don Ray,
Thayer Lyon, Dick Shaw, Foster Wil-
son, Marshall Goulding and Al Butler.

Tickets are being given away at
Keeler’s, the Bison, the D. U. House,
as well as at the door.

Skip Hess experienced difficulty in

the fine all-around play of Hess was
the difference.

Bill Goff then took over the reins
for the Herd and manhandled his
Gettysburg opponent, Fred Rice 6-2,

match and only in the second set did
Goff find it necessary to put on the

LUCKIES TASTE BETTER
THAN ANY OTHER CIGARETTE !

Fine tobacco—and only fine tobacco—can
give you the perfect mildness and rich taste
that make a cigarette completely enjoyable.
And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco. So if
you're not happy with your present brand
(and a 38-city survey shows that millions are
not), switch to Luckies. You'll find that
Luckies taste better than any other ciga-
rette. Be Happy—Go Lucky today!

IMMORTAL PERFORMANCES ?—
You can judge for yourself; you have
a choice of songs among Theme Songs,
Dance Band Hits, Small Combo Hits,
Keyboard of Jazz, Columbo-Crosby-
Sinatra, and Folk Singers. These are
the divisions among the six albums
which, along with the dozen classical
sets, mark RCA Victor’s ceiebration
of its fiftieth anniversary as a record
manufacturer. Unfortuniately, un-
like the superb series of reissues of
the peak performances of Caruso,
Chaliapin, Casals, and colleagues,
these are, with few exceptions, simply
memorable commercial hits, not much
better than juke-box average. You
have DORSEY’S BOOGIE WOOGIE
and LARRY CLINTON’S MARTHA,
FATS WALLER’S HONEYSUCKLE
ROSE and the GOODMAN Quartet’s
STOMPIN’ AT THE SAVOY, BINK’S
JUST A GIGOLO and GENE AUS-
TIN’S RAMONA. Best sides are
probably BUNNY BERIGAN’S IN A
MIST and COLEMAN HAWKINS’
BODY AND SOUL. None of the
records in this collection is a really
bad example of its genre; none is of
the best Victor has in its files, with
the possible exception of the vocal-
ists’ alubums. But how much more
fitting a celebration of an impressive
half-century would be a series of out-
of-print ELLINGTON, | significant

‘OF THE

Reporter Joins ‘Bitter Rash Cast;
Gives Advice To Lame And The Halt

by Bob Bell
My head reeled, my throat was scratchy, and I was oppressed with a

heavy cold, and feeling as if my hours were numbered, I stumbled into the in-
firmary.

A bedraggled nurse took one look
at me and rushed me to the over-
flowing isolation ward. In a matter
of minutes I had been transformed
from a student into a member of the
men of “Bitter Rash.” I had the
measles!

At 1:10, a nurse took my pulse
rate; at 1:15 she took my tempera-
ture; at 1:19 she took my water pistol.

About ten in the evening, a nurse
came over to my bed and said, “Roll-

Rub-down, that’s medical jargon for,

Thursday and Friday at the Cam-
pus Theater is the “Prince of Peace”,
I know nothing about it, except it is
done up in cinecolor and is of a re-
ligious nature. On the risk of being
called a psychothenic, I don’t think
there is a great deal to it. However,
if you’re the type that wears religion
on your sleeve instead of in your
heart, this picture is just your meat.

Saturday at the Campus, and Fri-
day and Saturday at the Capitol in
Milton is “Royal Wedding.” It stars
Jane Powell, Peter Lawford, Fred
Astaire and Sarah Churchill, and is
filmed in beautiful techniclor. Janie
and Fred are a dance team (brother
and sister) and travel to London dur-
ing the week of the royal wedding to
do a show. On the boat, popular
Jar finally meets her match in Peter
Lawford, and while in London, Fred
falls for Sarah, who is a dancer in the
show. It’s a sugary musical, but

There comes a time ‘every year

cease, at least as far as the “scholars”
are concerned, and houseparty this
year seems to be based on an inter-
national theme, ranging all the way
from the Sig’s Southern Plantation,
to the D-Ubangi Ball.

held at the chapter ‘hut’, which will

the female students seem to miss the

they did not want to attend a univer-
sity which was located in the city.
Expense Estimate High

When asked to estimate the cost of
one year at Bucknell, women students
put their cost between fifteen hundred
and two thousand dollars. The men
estimated the cost between a
sand and fifteen hundred.

A rather majority of stu-
dents seemed to favor the existence
of fraternities and sororities. They
seem to be predominantly in favor of

ablishment of an academic
honor system is favored by most of
the students who feel this system
would benefit Bucknell. Those who
disapprove of this system feel that “it
won’t work”.

Business Minded

Most Bucknellians do not plan to
enter graduate school. Approximately
half (counting engineers) plan to go
into business. Almost a third plan
to enter the professional world, and
the remainder are planning various
alternatives.

to pick things they thought college
should give them, training for a job,
ability to get along with people and
deal with problems ranked high.
Moral character, citizenship, and cul-
tural appreciation were judged the
least important.

College Good For Coeds

When asked to describe a number
of statements as “more true than
false” or “more false than true,” the
results show that Bucknellians be-

important for girls who marry im-

NO PREMIUMS ON QUEENS...

The Kansas State Collegian is a little jaded by all the queens on campus,
It declares: “Ever stop to count them? Don’t. It takes too long.
| “ ., Since queens are so commonplace these days,.a coed! feels aceom-
plished if she manages to get thruogh school without the honor. The fifty
per cent who aren’t elected a queen or attendant are flattered to think they’ve
kept their individuality.

«It would be better to lean more to quality instead! of quantity and
| thus keep our queens from getting lost in the shuffle.”

Phi Gamma Delta’s “Holiday Mag-

“Artistry In Rhythm” were runners
up with second and third places.

Lambda Chi faithfully carried out
its theme with a lighthouse, dock, and
fishing boats én the outside and a

on the inside. By winning the cup
for three times (48, ’49, 51), LCA

season
In lieu of the swan song usually written as an editor's last
editorial, a few lines about the BUCKNELLIAN seems more in

order this week—especially in view of a recent attack against
publications of our kind by the editor of another college paper,
the Bona Venture of St. Bonaventure University.

The Bona Venture it should be explained, is unlike our own
Student Voice in that it is subject to a direct and thorough cen-
sorship by the authorities of that school. The BUCKNELL-
IAN, as every student should know by now, is wholly free from
administration or faculty intervention. Although our stands on
various issues have been directly contrary to those of the admin-
istration, we have never been reprimanded in any way. The as-
sumption being, of course, that it is a student paper, financed for
the most part by appropriations from student activity fees. Our
faculty advisor, Professor Ewing, is just what his title implies.
Although a constant light of inspiration he has never thought of
lictating policy, a stand that isn’t too easy to take in the face of
yccasiona faculty pressure 4

An arrangement of this sort, says the Bona Venture, has re-
sulted in ‘““American secular student publications (that’s us) be-
ing reduced to carriers of moral filth, advocates of journalistic
irresponsibility and exponents of a misguided and abused defini-
tion of the honest principle of ‘Fyeedom of the Press’.” The
editor e nds on this to say that college papers of the Bona Ven-
ture’s cl are in general the only institutions of higher learn-
ing in America today that will teach the student not only what
the tools of writing but also how they are to be used, and
why they are to be use This would seem to be a pretty strong
statement to leave unqual for a paper that “knows how to pe r 5 =n s <=
use the tools of iting.’ he writer goes on to say that the

No, if the BUCKNELLIAN is an “instrument of misguided

He pointed out that the

armed forces are serious in this point of view since neither the military aca-

speed up their educational programs.

It is unfortunate that, at the pres-

doubts on our friendship towards the
people of the United States. They
misunderstand the meaning of friend-
ship. A real sincere friend is not
one who flatters you and approves
everything you do, but rather one who

and does not hesitate to criticize you
when he feels you are going wrong.
It is indeed a y that misunder-
standings of this kind should exist.
They are perhaps inevitable. But it
i tion like yours today which will

world rests with the young people of
today. If they are brave and strong,
patient and understanding, we can
confidently look forward to an era of
harmony and peace. I thank you
again for your generous gesture.

Fundamental studies are one
of the most important phases
of Du Pont research

Fundamental research is designed to
discover new scientific facts without
regard to specific commercial use. Yet
from it have come many products
of commercial significance.

At Du Pont, for instance, funda-
mental research has pointed the way

“Humph, I don’t think Bucknell is
from Pittsburgh!”

That was six and ~ one-half years
ago, when an unassuming looking
man first took over the newly organ-
ized Bucknell Police force; the scene
| was the back of a grocery store; the
woman, a Lewisburg matron; the
hired gunman, Paul A. Lemmon—
Chief of the Campus Cops.

At*that time, the war had caused
radical changes in Bucknell proced-
ure; for instance, women were quar-
tered in fraternity houses. During

man, a daytime officer to direct trif-

three. Watching the watchmen leave
reminded the speaker of one of the
hardest things a new watchman must
learn.

“Often after dark,” he explained,
“The empty buildings groan and
crack, making weird sounds so that
the novice officer must learn quickly
the difference between a creaking
plank and a falling footstep.”

sents one of the largest and best-

the world. Even so, less than half of
the Company’s total research per-

oratories in more than 25 other loca-
tions also carry on both fundamental
and applied research.

There are now about 800 technical
people engaged exclusively in re-
search work at the Experimental
Station. Assisting them are 1,500
others, ,in technical and non-technical
capacities. The research people repre-
sent a wide range of training. Among
them are organic, inorganic, physical,

groups.

Free for Research

At the Du Pont Experimental Sta-
tion every effort is made to permit
the research man to concentrate on
research. He is provided with the
most modern laboratory tools and for
theconstruction of specialequipment
he can call on a wide variety of serv-
ices. These include machine shops,
carpentry, electrical, welding, instru-
ment-making, and glass-blowing
shops. When the research worker
needs any service or equipment with-
in the scope of these shops, it is pro-
vided for him.

At this industrial research labora-
tory, Du Pont scientists are devoting
themselves to extending the fron-
tiers of science and creating “Better
Things for Better Living . . . through
Chemistry.”

Bucknell Band Gives Debut
Next Thursday At L. H. S.

Allan Flock will direct the Bucknell
Band in its concert debut in Lewis-
burg High School auditorium on
Thursday night, May 17, at 8:15 p.m.
The free concert will be, in Mr. Flock’s
estimation, a ‘unique situation’ due to
the fact that over 50 percent of the
band are frosh.

A feature of the evening will be
the LHS girl’s glee club accompanied
by the band, singing ‘Festival Finale’.

The concert will include the follow-
ing works:

ROTC Information Released
By Col. Barnes, Unit Head

Full plans and details concerning the Reserve Officers Training Corps have
been released by Col. Barnes, head of the R. 0. T. C. unit.

Freshmen Required To Enroll

The unit will go into operation this
September when all incoming fresh-
men will be required to enroll in the
program. It will be optional with
sophomores and juniors whether or

who have
service or military schooling will
enter the Basic Course:

Basic Training First

The Basic unit will meet for tw
hours of lectures each wek and will
take part in a one hour drill with
training in leadership and command.
For the three hours of work, one an¢
one-half hours credit will be given by
the University. The term of enlist-
ment for the Basic training will be
two years but it will be possible to
resign during this time. Those who
fail to maintain a satisfactory aca-
demic standing will be dropped.

Senior Training Follows

Upon completion of the basic train-
ing, students will be eligible to apply
for entrance into the Senior Course.
If accepted and deferred from the
draft, they will sign a contract with
the Army agreeing to spend a six-
week summer ion in training, ac-
cept a commission if offered, and
serve not more than two years active
duty as a commissioned officer. (At
the present time, R. 0. T. C. gradu-
ates are only being called for twenty-
one months service.

In the Senior Course, students will
spend four hours each week in classes
in addition to one hour on the drill
field. The University will grant two
and one-half hours credit for the mili-
tary work. Advanced students will
receive a monthly subsistence allot-
ment of ninety cents per day; uni-
forms will be provided free. While
at summer training camp, which is
usually held in the summer following
the junior year, students will learn
and practice such things as military
administration and personnel manage-
ment, psychological fare, tactics
and techniques, leadership, drill, and
exercise of command.

Deferments Given

Deferments generally will be given
to all those in the Advanced training
and to many in the Basic Course, de-
ending upon how large a deferment
quota Bucknell is allowed. A Defer-
ment Board, composed of two military
personnel and one faculty advisor, is
now being established to determine
who will be deferred. Freshmen will
not be deferred until they have satis-
factorily completed one semester of
school work.

Concerning the possibility of going
on to graduate school before being
called to duty, it is understood that a
graduate who has accepted a commis-
sion will have to get an extension
from the Department of the Army.

Col. Barnes and his staff will be on
hand in their office in the Bertrand
Library during regular office hours to

The ‘Old Man’ Comes Through

One of the amazing features of the May Day weekend was
the announcement that the Father’s Association stole the
mother’s thunder when the “old men” kicked in with a gift to
the University of over $5,000. Needless to say this represents a
sizeable gift in these times of inflation.

One other important fact announced at the same meeting
concerned the Student Loan Fund which the Association admin-
isters to help out students in occasional financial embarrassment.
Dean Musser told the Father's that the original amount of $500
in the fund now represented a turnover of over $4,000. Quite a
financial help to needy Bucknellians.

It won't be his day for another month but no one helped
make Mother’s Day more of a success than the “old man.”

Who’s Joined Whom?

Has Bucknell joined the Army or has the Army joined Buck-
nell? No matter from which angle you prefer to look at it, the
fact remains that the Army is officially here. Colonel Besser and
his staff are busy establishing the R. O. T. C. program here and
the interesting glances thrown the way of the male population
represent more than idle curiosity.

Mounds of Army literature are floating around and many of
the undercl re beginning to speculate about their appear-
ance in khaki 1e program is still somewhat of a mystery to

most but the men have ( el Barnes’ promise that things will

The best we can do now is extend a Bucknell “hello” to

Off The Editorial Cuff

L’ Agenda walked off with first place honors in yearbook
competition at the annual Pi Delta Epsilon convention in Blacks-
burg, Va., a week ago. A doff of the editorial eyeshade to the
1950 L’Agenda staff and Editor Joe Rubinstein for a job well
done.

While handing out the orchids, one goes to the baseball team.
The Lanemen will defend their Middle Atlantic crown this week-
end at Lehigh in an attempt to win the tournament for the second
successive season. Best of luck men.

Say It Isn’t So

May 13, 1951

| Dear Sir:

| dear sir, tell me they aren’t going to

Please say it isn’t so. Tell me they
aren’t going to put a gold ball two
feet in diameter on top’ of the flag-
And please

top this with a gold Bison
weather vane.

What in the world are they build-
ing up there, a library or a deluxe
stack of steel pancakes? I can’t un-
derstand the method behind this engi-
neering madness.

Many of the students are worried
over the prospect of the library’s be-
ing topheavy if those jackhammer
jerks keep up their steady skyward
climb. We're all as concerned over
school spirit as the next guy but still
the prospect of seeing Bucky standing
up there on a two foot gold sphere is
too much.

I’m proud of our school emblem but
I'll be darned if I can see the sense
in overbuilding such a tremendous ad-
dition to the University.

sincerely,

Bang Up Publicity

Dear Editor:

No, this isn’t another gripe letter.
It is just my expression of congratu-
lations to those who were in charge |
of the publicity work for Cap and |
Dagger’s “Leocadia”. It was a job]
well done! It has been a long time |
since Bucknell has seen the likes of it. |
Let’s hope Cap and Dagger will keep |
up the good work. |

The packed houses for the perform-
ances evidenced the fact that students |
will support school activities if prop-

erly presented to them as’ was “Leo- |

cadia.”

Again, I doff my dusty derby to
the chairman and workers on C and D
publicity.

Sincerely,
Keith Law

things aren’t as bad as they might
A hurried call to Mr. Hayden,
Librarian, reveals that Bucky will not
stand on a gold ball. Atop the pole
will be a weather vane in the form of
a Bison. Not too much, do you think?

ROVING PHOTOGRAPHER ....
There’s a photographer “operating” on campuses in the south who has a
| unique way of taking pictures. His subjects aren’t too fond of his methods,
if a notice posted in a women’s dormitory at a southern university is any proof.

-| The notice said:

“Tt has come to our attention that a pseudo-photographer is operating on
different college and university campuses in the Southern area. He is report-
ed to follow this procedure: J

“He calls the coed by phone, usually by name, stating that he is a pro-
| fessonal photographer taking pictures for magazine covers and stating that

the coed has been referred to him by one of her friends; he then makes an ap-
| pointment with the coed, takes a few pictures, and then (without the knowl-
edge or consent of the coed) cuts off large chunks of hair from the back of
their head.

Hartford, Conn.—(I. P.)—Trinity College has established one of the most
liberal student loan funds ever to be administered by an American college, it
was announced here by President G. Keith Funston.

A revolving loan fund has been established with 80 per cent of a $143,000
bequest from the late George J. Mead, an honorary Trinity alumnus and co-
| founder of Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Company, to be used for loans to stu-
dents specializing in the fields of Government, History, Economics, or Public
Speaking. :
| The bequest provides for short term loans of $100 or less to be repaid
| within 12 months (before graduation) and long term loans not to exceed $1,000
to be repaid within 5 years after graduation, each without interest. The re-
| maining 20 per cent of the bequest will be used for prizes, lectures and other
| special purposes in the fields of Government, History and Economics.

| Philadelphia, Pa.—(I. P.)—Drexel Institute of Technology has adopted
| plans to permit the entrance of a section of its 1951 freshman class at the
| beginning of the Summer Quarter in June, 1951. This action is in keeping
| with recent announcements of the U. S. Department of Defense encouraging
| college studnts to continue their courses of study. Concern has been express-
| ed by representative engineering societies that the United States will face a
| shortage of technically trained personnel, both in industry and in the armed
| forces.

Dr. James Creese, Drexel’s president, declared, “We are concerned that
the young men and women of this country have as much €ducation as possible
before the time when they may be called upon for military service or defense.
“The academic year at Drexel is regularly divided into four terms or quarters.
Therefore, the students now to be admitted at the beginning of the next Sum-
mer Quarter will be able to begin basic military training and complete all the
course requirements for freshman and sophomore years by September, 1952.
Utilizing the Summer Quarters in 1951 and 1952, June freshmen will also
be able to complete the five quarters of training required for the R. O. T. C.
Military Training Certificate. award also enables students to qualify
for selection for the R. 0. T. C. Advanced Course at the Institute. Those se-

An English professor at the University of North Carolina was rambling

“Take the word lady,” he said. “It used to mean something fine, but now
since some women of disrepute have termed themselves ladies, the word has

MILLER TO PRESENT
3RD ANNUAL RECITAL
IN BAPTIST CHURCH

Mr. Russell Miller will present his
third and last annual violin recital at
the First Baptist Church on Tuesday,
May 22, at 8:30 p.m.

The program. includes compositions
from the Italian classical ‘school,
through the Romantic to the ‘French
Impressionistic period. Ernest Chaus-
son’s “Poeme,” for ‘violin and .orches-
tra, is recognized as ‘one of the most
exquisite compositions ever written
for this instrument. Nadia boulang-
er, whose “Necturne and Cortege”
will be performed, ‘was the first wo-
man ever to Ibe awarded the Prix de
Rome in Music. Her brilliantly start-
ed career ‘was interrupted :in 1918 . by
her untimely death at the age of 25.

The most famous composition of
the great Spanish violin virtuoso,
Pablo Sarasate, is his “Zigeunerwei-
sen,” or “Gypsy Airs.” The .tune
“Golden Earrings” is taken from this
piece. Here ne must visualize a
gypsy improvising melodies on his
violin before a campfire. -The wild
finale with its brilliant left-hand piz-
zicati is an effective example of the
gypsy style.

The “Introduction
priccioso” is one of

and Rondo Ca-
Camille Saint
Saens most famous compositions. It
achieved particular popularity a few
years ago when Jascha Heifetz played
it in the movie “They Shall Have
Music.”

Mr. Miller’s accompanist will be

Rev. Knapp Speaks
To CA Officers

Reverend Charles Knapp, minister
of the Baptist Church, addressed the
new officers of the Christian Associa-
tion at their installation ceremony
last Sunday evening in Hunt Living
Room.

Dr. Knapp told the new officers not
to be afraid of their inexperience and
encouraged them to do the best of
their ability. Following his talk, Dr.
Knapp administered communion to
those present.

Dick Arnesman, the former C. A.
president, welcomed the new cabinet
members and challenged them to
carry out their duties as CA officers
effectively. Sally Baumgardner, the
newly elected president, accepted
these responsibilities on behalf of the
cabinet.

During the membership meeting
which followed the installation cere-
mony the new cabinet discussed plans
for student church and special study
groups for next year. No definite
conclusions were reached.

Bretz Relieves Roush In 9th;
Shirk’s Walk Forces In Run

by Ellwood Rowe

Forced to go into extra innings for the first time in the current season,
the Orange and Blue baseball squad rose to the occasion Tuesday afternoon at
Philadelphia by pushing across a run in the top of the tenth to hand Temple
University a 6-5 setback—its ninth defeat of the season. For the victorious
Lanemen, who are riding the crest of a five game winning streak, it was vic-
tory number eight as against only three sebtacks.

Bird Makes Final Round
In Oratorical Contest

Robert Bird, Bucknell senior, rep-
resenting the state of Pennsylvania,
made the final round before being
eliminated in the National Collegiate
Oratorical Tournament at Northwest-
ern University in late April. He was
one of the six contestants who with-
stood the preliminary and semi-final
rounds and thereby gained a chance
to be declared number 1 collegiate
orator in the United States.

Bird, a pre-ministerial student, won
the oratorical championship of Penn-
sylvania at Temple University in
March and thereby gained the right
to represent the state at the national.
For this honor he was awarded a gold
key by the Debate Association of
Pennsylvania Colleges.

The title of Bird’s oration was “The
Moral Law Within”, and it called for
a moral rebirth of mankind.

desk in Roberts Hall.

Of Intentions And Desires

The Draft Office wishes to remind
all men subject to the draft to notify
their local draft boards of the follow-
ing items: intention to take the Se-
leetive Service Qualification Test, de-
sire for postponement of induction,
request of the University to report
class standing, and request for are-
view of status after receipt of test
results and class standing.

The Draft Office located in 109
West Wing, should be informed of
intentions regarding the draft and
should be asked to send in class
standings if it has not already been
done.

articles to that effect in red ink.

The University cannot assume re-
sponsibility for articles left by stu-
dents during the summer, because
their rooms are needed to house var-
ious groups which will meet on cam-
pus from June to August.

Publishes Article On Symbolism
