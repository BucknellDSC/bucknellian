W,"alton C'loke I suppose that it's nee<iles>> to say, ""Welcome to Bucknell, Krosh"" as that fat'tor in your college life has been taken care of over and over in the past tw I days. But i*"" you think that acknowleilKinfr the many hearty welconie.s is wearing you down, ju.st wait unlii you i-onie liack next year and have to explain to everyone of your friends just what you did durint; the past summer. That's when stamina counts. But seriously the BlKTv-"
NELI.IAN,"stair extends to you a hearty welcome to Bucknell University. We hope that you find the Bucknell Way of life t<< be your Way of Life, and the traditions of Bucknell something to  be cherishe<l, now and for all time."
GREEK,"BLITZKKEK; ,, ...^ In another week the Bucknell Campus will be the scene of a Blitz- kreip that would force Adolph Hitler, if he could view its complete oper- ation, to hanjf his hea*! in shame. The Greeks have a synonym for the word ""Blitzkreig"" called ""Rushing"". It isn't exactly the type one finds on the football field, but it certainly has its similarities. During the next week there will be one behind every bush, Greek.s I mean, and you dear Kreshmen will l>e the victims. Not victims in the sense that you will be stabbed in the back or have your months allowance taken away from you, but victims in the sense that you will be subjected to the smoothest gift of gab that you will ever be privileged to hear."
YOU,"will be feated as the conquering heroes (for one week). Food, shows, and plenty of backslapping will be yours in abundance. Your every word will be a command, and you will never hear a>;ain, in such a verbose man- ner, just what a swell guy you ar-?. You will have sterling qualities, that y<iu never knew you possessed, revealed to you in all their splendor. You'll be the top.i."
"BUT,","and there is a <-atL'h to everything, to continue to be the ""tops'"" on the Bucknell cami)us, it will be to your advantage to join the ""I"
.AMMA,"FROSH"" frateniity. Here (so you will be told) you will find the cream of the campus as far as manhood is concerned. If they aren't all football players, they're all basketball men, and if they aren't all honor students, they're all the best dressed men on the campus. If that doesn't convince yrm they still have an ace in the hole. They (late the ""I .\M.MA CLT.A"" sorority girls, and anyone knows that the ""I A.M."
MA,"CUTA"" girls are classed as the mo.st select group of feminine pulchritude <>n the campus. .And if that doesn't convince you. there is a niechaniral instrument known as a lead pipe which, although it is a mythical symbol, represents to the N'th degree high pres.sure salesman- ship.    .And that dear freshmen is a crude outline of fraternity rushing in its entirety - But always remember that you are the one who is being rushed.

Be wide awake and look b<'- yond the big build-up I'f fine dinners, entertaiiuuent, back-Jilapping, and veneered facts. .See the fraternities for what they really are. Look the men over carefully. Be sure that you would be willing to associate with them for the next three or four years, and be proud to call them brothers. Know what the fraternity stands for on the Bucknell campus in the way <<)f sportsmanship, scholarship, and social standards. .Ask all the ques- tions that come into your mind. The an.swers may be highly polished, l)ut by a little ob.servaticm you can determine their true worth. After you have a clear conception of fraternities on the campus, and what you think they .stand for. then make your choice. .And may it Ix* a happy line, for three or four years in an environment that you dislike isn't ver>' pleasant."

Be- sides losing backfield men Serrao, Woods, and Brandt, plus guard Jimmy Moore, Humphrey's little band of gridders face Penn State in the open- ing encounter. State boasts fifteen lettermen from last year's s*iuad, plus twenty-five capable reserves. As if this wasn't enough the Burke- Wadsworth Bill is upon us. .Al says that if the conscription bill is pa.ss- ed, and 19 of his boys are drafted, he will brush up on his ping pong so that he can coach the girls varsity team. By Bill Grithth Bucknell's Orange and Blue colors have flown b<'side the Crim- son Tide of Cornell and the .Army Gray. They have flown with the Navy Blue and the Blue and White of Penn State. Likewise, the Flucknell Bison has entangled the Fordham Ram and th.? Nittany Lion. It has defeated the Army .Mule and Yale's Bulldog. The animal image of every college and university has behind it a traditional tale which the sons of the variou:? schools forever sing. Bucknell's Bison comes from a heri- tage which is among the mo.st fas- cinating in the country. American sports writers have always ))refere<l to apply identifying names of wild beasts to gridiron warriors. As the Orange and Blue warriors became famous shortly after the ini- tiation of football at Bucknell, sports WTiters began racking their brains f(>r an appropriate identification tag for"

Rushing will be the first event on the Bucknell fraternities' social cal- ender, and will .start Thursday, Sep- tember 19. hrism, but can't help but note the practicality and significance of the Dean's special introduction of Mr. Dayton Ranck, College Treasurer, to fieshmen Tliursday evening at the welcoming assembly, as ""one of the people at Bucknell with"

B.,
U.,"Tue.sday evening the cla.s.s of 1944 *a.s privileged to listen to what un- doubtedly was one of the ino.st appro- ]>>riate and expeditiously carried oul pre-rushing-week programs which has ever been sponsored on the Bucknell <<-anipu.s. Bucknell's three integral social in- stitutions cooperated to present the program. Ihe Pan-Hellenic Council, the Interfraternity i'ouncil. and the Student Campu.s Club designed the evening's activities under the faculty supervi.sion of Deans Dyer and Page. .Speaking for  Ihe interests of th' .Student Campus Club. Professor Clar- ence Richard.xon made the statement ""There are no barbs at Bucknell"". He then defined the term *T)arb"" as an appelation which is given 1<<>> all nnn-afiiliated students on most college campuses, and amplified the definition further by staling that the term is a shiirteniHl form of the word ""barbar- ian"". Editorially we might add that the term ""barb"" to the ears of non- afiiliated students on many college campuses is the cruel, narrow-mind- ed, and bigoted product of fraternit> and sorority snob factories. ProfeHHor Kichardstm need not have made the statement that ""there are no barbs at HiickncH"". This trutii waH indet^l a self-evident one to any clear-mind<<*d individual who attended the ""Special lnterpretali%e Program "" Tuesday evening. Had barb* existed on the Bucknell campus, there would tiave been no banquet fable spread in l.arison Living riwim. with .Hor<>>rity and fraternity representatives seateii censure beside non-atfiliated students. There' SAa Fa*iKiKe ' Would have been no speeches aiNiul Bucknell's social organizations, their aims, functions, and accomplishment. There would have b<<>en no singing of Bi'cknell songs, with every student in ' Ihe room feeling little chills <<>>f proiid- ness running up his back becau.se he ' is fortunate enough to be a living i part of Bucknell. All this would have ' been tab<>>o on a c am pus where ( ""l.arbs"" roam"
rampant.,"I ""Barbs"" are the most significant 1 proof that the fraternity and .sorority"
|,"svstems on a college campus are in- | lernally rotten and corrupt. The term ' was maliciously coined by disgruntled (*reeks, who. failing to pledge Ihe i best men and women on their campus because of Ihe iinatl ractiveness of their respective ""brotherhoods"", sub- stituted   the belly-aching of frustra- ' lion f<<H Ihe ""backaches"" which lead ' to success, and c<<>>ndeinned because , they could not acquire merely a j twentieth-cent iiry \ersion of At'sop's si'ga of the fox and the sour grapes. | Kralernily men and sorority women { al Bucknell can well l)e proud of the ' fiicl thai Ihe term ""barb"" is not in j our campus vernacular. Its absence | is definite nroof that the fraternal , oi gani/alinns on this campus are of , such solid and enduring foundations, i tjiat it is not neces.sary to use Htiob- bt ry as a weai>on lo coerce freshmen i and other non-affiliated students to i join. Kralernily and sorority rush- i inn and pledging on this campus are of Ihe ""positi\e"" type. 'Ihe (ireek-s # are loo proud of Ihe precepts and i<!<<als of their groups to reMirl to | negativism. Their philosophy regard- j ing fraternities and sororities at | Bucknell is thai the individual joins them in an effort to ""heller"" himself, and not lo save himnelf from sfvcial"
ON,
THE,
CAMPUS,By Walton Cloke
FROSH,R K(; A LI
A,"It seems to this writer that this year's crop of Freshmen are quite the most inconspicious group of neophytes to enter Bucknell's Collegiate sphere of influence in many a year. Not casting any aspersions your way Frosh, but I can r-ememl)er when the cla-;s of '4'2 entered Bucknell, and that's not so long ago, we were wearing dinks the .second day of Fi-eshman W<<ek Of course it's not an unwritten law that you must wear the traditional dink that early, but it shows the Soph's, when they .'*eturn, that you are ready to do business. Until you have .seen 250 Freshmen in a boily wearing dinks, black .<<iocks, and ties, you won't lealize just what an imressive g^oup of first year men you are _ In a few short weeks, after the upperclassmen are back on the campus, you will have the privilege of contacting a body known to all Bucknellians as the TRIHl'NAL. It is the constitutional right of this esteemed body to enforce all Freshman rules on the campus. To date they have done an excellent job, a.s .some of last years' campus cut-ups tan tell you Dinks, black socks, and black ties, are as traditional as the friendly ""Hello"" spirit on the Bucknell campus. So get into the awing of things early fellows. Frosh regalia is a necessity. Take a little fatherly ad- vice and do your sartorial shopping early, or the Tribunal will get you if you don't watch out. After watching the influx of students for the past week we feel that all college coe<is should take a course in narration and description, especially description. If you have never been an observer when a coed goes into some of our local mercantile establishments you have missed one of the real highlights of Butknell."
A,"young lady who wishes to j)urchase some electrical eijuipment for her room is one reason why local merchants turn grey. No one would ex()ect a young and beautiful coed to know a great deal about electrical fixtures, but having .seen simple lighting e<iuipment at some time in her life, she should be able to give the clerk a rea.son- able description of the material she wants. Now when a cued says she wants one of those things that you plug in the floor with holes on two sides and a socket for a bulb on the other side, with a thing-a-ma-jig that will turn off the radio but still allow the current to circulate to her floor lamp, a clerk is supimsed to know just what she wants. Which is a 3-way current tap with a light bulb adapter and a cut-out pull chain for the bulb. CJeneraliy a .sales clerk has been through .so many of those keen de.scriptions that they can tell what the coed wants and no nuestions ask. But there are some demands for certain fixtures that haven't been invented yet, that can really stump a clerk. Which all reminds one of the married man who wired his owii home and had music coming out of the refrigerator and ice forming on the radio. Which would all prob- ably happen in the Sem if they had refrigerators."
Frosh,
Phantasmagoria,"ipACP The anticipation of things to come looms large in Ihe liven of Bucknell neophytes, as upper-classnien return lo the campus, and the year's activities begin. The dreaded .Senior Tribunal is ready lo start meting out punishment lo erring frosh as rules go into effect."

mean.,"I'm the guy what wasn't going to like it and after one week I'm nuts about the place. It's the ivy covered walls and soniethin' they call tradition, not to mention a cute little blonde what inakes me like the place. Tradition is sumethin' lik<< do'in things over and over because they was done before. Like pop eat'in gravy on his cake, just like his pop did. That's tradition Mom and with me it's 0. K. The first week was just one exam after another. I ain't so sure I made out in my english Mom, but it ain't like I'm gonna flunk out, cau.se they said I could take English 101. 101 don't mean that I gotta insert my self in that class 101 times. It is the number of the course, which is the way they number things here, somethin' like pop's social security number. We had a lot of what they call social events, which ain't nothin' more than dancin', and maybe the jitterbugs ain't .somethin"". They re- mind me of that little guy down the block what had St. Vitus dance, only they look worse. Next week is when the upper class men come back and then we gotta walk the chalk line. They ain't very easy on wise guys they tell me. Well I gotta climb into bed before the coun.selor, which is a guy what runs this floor stnnethin' like uncle Jake at the old men's home, gets on my neck for making to much noise on this typewriter. Kiss Susie for me and tell pop I'll send his cardboard shirt front home after the first big shin-dig. Ix)ve, Junior."

Noticeably unsettled is the back- fifld situation which l>eoame acute when Jim litanili left sihool because of a knee injury. Bob Woods entered the Naval Academy and Frank Ser- lao, a 193y letter Minner, was lost be- cause of an appendectomy. Before this sudden chanpe of cicrumstances. it -was the front wall that was fur- rowing the brow of Coach Hum- phreys. Slightly lighter than usual, the ThunderiiiK Herd will depend upon spee<l and deception instead of power during this campaign. I'reparc for .State Contest Abandoning two-a-day drills, the Herd will have single practices from row until their tough opening as-Siign- menl with Penn .State on October .t. Pre-season prognoslicators cry.stal- gaze State as one of the standouts of the Kast this season, making their predictions on the assumption that l.""! returning' letter winners should make good material for a winning conibin-"
fltion.,"> . The BLsons aren't too bad off when it comes to the subject of returning lettermen. They have ten of the de- sirables theni.selves: Co-captains Bes- Fcl and Plewak, Boner, Dueger, Gore, Knupp, McKIhany, Nagel. Priore. and Wenrick. It's the (juestion of suffi- cient reserves that is worrying the Orange and Blue, as usual."
A,Fight for Every Position
A,"move calculated to make use of his triple-threat possibilities shifted Mel Knupp to the left half slot, as the battle for starting posts put the Herd squad in the ""tightenest"" .<<tafe oi mind of any team in recent years. Knupp, who alteniated with Dueg er in signal calling duties la.st year, has looked i;:'fat in jiractice so far this"
year.,"Especially noteworthy have b<<>en hi.; excellent punting and driving plunges on view at the last few scrimmages. Chet Podd, one of the all too few sophomores remaining for service should also see plenty of action a-x tailback on the underman- ned Bi.'ion eleven. The same goes for the greatly improved, but still too light. Fred Fahringer, who has displayed marksman.-ihip as a pas.- tosser. J^ahringer, since the absencf of injured Lefty Eyster, has been putting in some work at right half. Walt Wenrick stands an excellent chance of grabbing the starting a^- aJgnment at right half."
A,"depen<l- able blocker and powerful plunger. Wenrick i.s continuing the work which won him an opening post last year (Continued from page 1) .#Ml junior an<l .senior men at Buck- nell who have pas.sed their nineteenth birthday, and"
who,"are capable of passing the required physical e.xam- ination, are eligible to take the fly- ing course. The cost to each individ- ual is twenty-five dollars. Six dol- lars of this amount pays for the phy- sical examiation, nine dollars are used for insurance on the .>;tudent, with the remaining ten dollars being u^ed for personal expenses. The University will furnish trans- portaticm to and from Danville for flight instruction. The Civil Aero- nautics Authority will take care of all other expenses. Dean Page has .stated that Huck- rell will sponsor two training units during the school year. The first unit will l>e somewhat of an experi- ment, and will be limited to 20 stu- <lents. It will end on .January 1, 1941. The second unit will follow- immediately after the first one. and vnll be enlarged or reduced, accord- ing to the success of the initial unit. Those students who show excep- tional ability and interest in flying after they have completed the first or.urse will have the opportunity to take a more advanced course, accord- ing to Dean"
Page.,He stated that certain men will be selected for train- ing in how to handle ships of the heavier types. These men will also be given in- struction in advanced navigation and other pubje<ts leading to the fulfill- ment of recjuirements necessary for a regular commercial pilot's license.

The,"newly-instituted Freshman ' (ilee Club, under the direction of rrnfe.<<sor Harold Cook of the Depart - r:ent of .Music arui comprising forty- seven men to date, opened the .sea.son with their first full rehearsal last Tuesday evening. The purpose of the Freshman Club is as that of all those Clubs on the campi of other universities and larg- er colleges, is to prepare men for the tiaveling Varsity Club. It is in- 1 tended as 'i training group for such Dien, to prepare them in reading music and in learning 'the fundamen- tals of musicianship; however, in ex- ceptional cases where the member has an unusually good voice, and at the .same time is participating in private work in the field of voice, then the Varsity Club will accept such an .npplicant. The Club will practice numbers to be done by the Mixed Chorus; just before their concerts, they will com- bine with the Chorus in the latter's pioductiona. They will appear in Chapel, locally, in nearby towns, and on important weekends as well. According to Professor Cook, the Freshman Club plans to make its fi-st appearance in the program planned for Father's Day i>ii October 12th. Rehearsals are held from 7:00 to 8:30 every Tuesday night. After this week no more try-<iuts will he given for the Club."

Is there no hope that >>>>e can create a better world in which the youth< of all nati<ms can liv*- toRether in peace and decency, without beioR inflamed peri(>>dicall> t(>> fieht each other? Answering the first question, Preai- !d<<nt Marts said, ""La.st year. I sug- gested we help Kngland and France with all the supplies that they wish- ed from us. In fact, 1 suggested that we give them a billi<m dollars worth of material and call it a"

Due to increased ! enrolment and a more favorable date, indications are that last year's record attendance will be broken. Due to the early date Cap and Dag- ger will not give its traditional [Father's Day play, but the School of Music, with the coopt-rartion of the C.

This chap- ter of Phi Eta Sigma was founded ( n the Bucknell campus in \W.K and becomes more successful each year. In the words of Charles Thompson, Grand President of Phi  Eta Sigma: "".Membership in Phi Eta Sigma is a goal for all freshmen"
men,"to seek. Membership is something more than a recognition of excellence in .scholar- ship; it .ser\es as an inspiraticm in seeking that end. From his first day in school, the fre.shman is reminded m a variety of ways of the path he must pursue if he is to gain this recognition, and, being reminded, he is inspired early in his school life to be satisfied with nothing less than his best.""

A,"country' fair was in progress at the Pi Beta Phi suite, as the son)rity tumwl up to entertain in rustic gingham dresses. Rooms surround- ing the suite were fixed to re.semble booths, where both the pink lemonade always neces.sary to a fair were dis- ptn.sed, and the clever ""pig bank"" favors were given away. One of the featured games of the afternoon was Bingo, La Fiesta was the name given to Delta Zetas mexican-spanish party on Hunts' top floor as the sorority en- tertained the new rushees. The suite was decorated in mexican style, and for entertainment songs and games were presented. The favors for each guest fitted in well with the collec- tion-conscious habit of college girls. They were comic miniature figurines r.iade of pi))e cleaners, due to be placed on what-not or book shelf. Three More Parties Tomorrow the entertaining will be done in the evening and Satunlay'.s will be held in the aftenioon. .Sun- day will be observed by the tradititm- al silence between the new an<l .sor- ority girls, while on Monday the final pieferential party will be givi-n in the evening. With this last party, women's rushing will draw to a con- clusion, as bids will be tlisributed at Jioon on October Lst. By Octob<<'r .""^rd the whole proce<lure will be over with for another year. It will probably be with mingled feelings that the events of the past week come to a finish. Hard work on party projects has been the li>t of the sorority girls during the entire summer, and few people realize the hectic activity to selecting a con- genial pledge group for ones soror- ity.

Woman's College isn't run on a jani- tor's whim. Maybe they had been wa.sting too much water in the preceding years. Maybe the drip-drip-drip of partly turned off faucets had brought in.som- nia to .some of the dorm dwellers. when the water won't stay turned on. Y'ou turn it on, then reach for your brush. And lo, the poor college girl. The water's off again. So you turn the handle with your left hand and grip the brush with your right. Then you reach for the tube of toothpaste You have to scjueeze the tube Y'ou have to get out of there and get dressed before thy close the dining hall You have to use your feet That's the way they're doing it, as of today. The one-legged preferred stance is all the vogue. Y'ou stand on your right foot (left if you're a .southpaw) and curl the other one around the basin, crouch over, clutch- ing the wall for support, turn the water on, push your big toe against the faucet and hold. .Acrobatic bend- ir.g brings toothbrush, powder, towel, etc., within fairly easy reach. Also, or twice and threatened the floor with innundation. .And maybe it was all a subversive plot on some University official's part to test the agility and ingenuity of the woman of the future. There is an art to. brushing one's tffth at fi:50 of a Monday morning must be done. Not only did  the De- partment of Music declare the Glee Club nil before the try-outs Satur- day, which everyone who wi.shed to join was recjuired to take, but the tcts included sight-reading, etc-., which will bring about an efficient club.

Arithmetically,
Broken,
Hearts,This year there will be 62 girls
who,won't be going sorority. Not that this is out of the ordinary and its true that
they,"all have been given equal rushing opportunities, but these 62 girls can't possibly be cons-dtrcd."
even,
from,the first.
Who,arc
they?,
No,one will
know,until after it is all
over.,It doesn't matter
whether,"they are pretty, clever or"
accomplished,: plain arithmetic will take care of them. Sororities
who,
undoubtedly,"might want,"
them,as
members,will have nothing to
say.,The fixed quota system is the villian in this
case.,It's easy to see that out of the 170 girls desiring to
become,"affiliated with a sorority, and from the"
maximum,"18 bid by each group, a balance of at least 62 girls will be left un- organized. Is this necessary"
when,both interested parties are anxious to get
together?,
Peihaps,
Pan-Hellenic,is correct in not
changing,"policies in the midst of rushing, perhaps some sor- orities are correct in their feeling that"
they,don't
want,"more pledges than actives, and perhaps these girls will be perfectly"
happy,"unorganized, but frankly we doubt it."
There,are several
remedies,"to ease the situation, and in- formal February rushing has"
been,
offered,
by,Pan-Hellenic. This and the
knowledge,that due to a record
enrollment,the
whole,
problem,could not be forseen. is offered in
apology,to those women
"""whom","arithmetic will take care of."""
Straw,
Polls,
and,
Scatterbrains,
The,editorial staff of
"""The","Bucknellian"" has discussed the possibilities and practicality of conducting a straw poll on cam- pus, in an effort to determine what attitude"
the,
student,
body,takes
toward,the national presidential
campaign,of
1940.,
We,"believe that a poll of this type, if properly conducted,"
would,be of real value in determinint; just
what,
students,
in,
a,typical
American,University think about the
momentous,issues which the voters of this country will be considering
when,they go to the polls in
November.,It is no
compliment,"to Bucknell's student body,"
when,we
make,"the editorial statement that we are a trifle (afraid) to con- duct such a poll on campus, but this is the case,"
and,
we,have grounds to prove that our fears are well founded. Of what are we
afraid',
Student,flippancy
and,"indiffer- ence, which abounds so completely on this"
campus,that it often
becomes,intensely disgusting.
What,
happened,at Bucknell's
"""Mock",
Republican,
Nominat-,"ing Convention "" last spring."
What,could have been one of the most constructive extra-curricular activities ever
sponsored,on this
"campus,",turned into a ridiculous fiasco because the inde- pendence of the individual
became,the indifference of the mob.
The,few idealistically
minded,
students,
who,
planned,the
Model,
Convention,hoped to get a sample of representative stu- dent opinion on the political outlook of 1940. and to
convey,to the student body
some,idea of
how,a national
nominating,con- vention operates. These aspirations (no matter
how,noble they
may,have been) were rapidly
thrown,into the discard
when,fra- ternities and sororities thought it would be fun to forget about the serious aspect of the
Model,
Convention,(individual thinking is such a tiring ordeal) and just
nominate,
whoever,the (right) clique of Greeks might
happen,to select
in,"their stumbling, thoughtless, political prowling. ""The Bucknellian"" has lost most of its faith in the collective reasoning power of"
Bucknellians.,
We,hesitate
to,
conduct,a presidential straw poll on
campus,because we
do,not
wish,"to prostitute the national crisis of 1940 on our pages, by subjecting it to the indifference and"
shoulder-shrugging,of a student
body,which is too lazy to think.
We,"of the editorial staff are interested in (analysis), not"
(partisanship).,
We,"carry no i>olitical banners,"
harangue,for no particular
candidate.,
We,think that an honest opinion of a ma- jority of Bucknell students on
who,should be president of the United States during the next four crucial
years,
would,have great news
value.,"But we can only get such an opinion from a conscientious, thinking group of"
individuals.,
Can,you give it to us?
ON,
THE,
CAMPUS,"by W'altun C'loke With con.scription pigeon-holed for college men until the end of the present academic ^'ear, most of the masculine population, as well as"
w,"the feminine inhabitants, are looking forward to a real .social sea.'son on the Bucknell canlpu^'. Buck- nell's social season is highlighted by three class lances, featuring so-called ""name"" bands, which are selected by their popularity and the size of the class treasury. Ijist year the three big dances were un- doubtedly the best that Bucknellians have had the pleasure to swing and sway at in many a year. l.,eH Brown, Will Osborn, and Glen Miller presented snu)oth and subtle rythm>> plus concentrated jive that pleased Bucknellian.s no end. But just like a football team that has had a successful season, this year's class commit- tees have a record to uphold, and that is going to be a difficult propo- sition. . <<,"
.,". . . . Prot'es.sor Stillnian, who is the faculty adviser for the class dances, deserves an unlimited amount of credit for his efforts in bring- ing Glen Miller and his band to the campus last year. This year with the cooperation of the entire .student body and the class committees, he will e(|ual and better last year's record. We repeat he will do it with t'OOPKH.ATION, which is something the entire school should remember. After asking a few questions, we decdied to pick the bands con- sidered by the man on the campus to be potential material for the big ""three"" in Bucknell dances. Here they are So{)homore Cotillion liay Herbeck or W Ka%-alin Junior Prom _ Bobby Burns. Bob Che.ster, or Jan Savitt Senior Ball _,, Jimmy Doisey or Tommy Dor.sey Of course changing conditions may place better bands on the list, 01 financial conditions may be such that they won't allow sufficient finan- cial remuneration for the bands we would like to have, but these are the straws in the wind today."
O--,
T--,
C,"In looking over several campus oiganizations, just recently, we had the opportunity to see the Student Cooperative Bookstore in action. Aftei watching dozens of F^rosh and as many upper classmen buying their first semester's supply of book knowledge at the .store, we are of the definite belief that here is the place for average students to balance their book budget. By the average student we mean the one who trades his or her books iti at the end of the semester for the following semes- ters volumes. The bookstore will take your used books and resell them for ten percent of the received amount. To date this method has resulted in better pi ices for students wht) were in the habit of practically giving their books away to agents who fre<|uent th>>' camjiu.-; foi- tht- large book concerns. Vou may leave your book on the shelves of the bookstore at your price as long as you want to, and if it can't be sold you may clami it at any time. Or you may have the student in charge get what he can for it and apply the cash on new books. .N'o matter how you look at it you vill have tf) admit it's a profital)le plan for both the student and the bookstore. .\ot <mly do you make a profitable exchange on books, but you givi- *#mployment to a staff of five Bucknell students, and make it pos- sil)te f<<)r them to attend .school, which is more than can be said for thf large book concerns that attempt to do business on the campus. With cimtinued student cooperation in this jilan for securing hook.- the business will be put on a profit-sharing plan for all students in the near future."

Conference,"Score another one for the Bucknell Way of Life-- George Ishii, that smil- ing bov from Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii attributes his pre.sence here to the friendliness of the Bucknell delegates tu the Eagles Mere Conference this* summer. George had been in the United States for a year, attending the Friends Select .School-- a jireparatory school in Philadelphia. He finished Jest Spring, and wanted to go to col- lege although he had not .selected one then. At the sugge.stion of the Ilev. Fred Igler, graduate of Bucknell in the clas.s of 1912, he decided to ac- company him to the Conference anil meet delegates from the 52 colleges represented. It was there that h<S <io<<-ide<i to come to come to Bucknell. tieorge visite<l the United States in liM'l to attend the Chicago World's Fair. .4fter the fair he took a two- t>ionths tour of 2<< .states. He then returned to his home to finish his schooling. ""Lihue"", .said Ge<<>rge in a chamber of commerce manner, ""is called the Garden Island because of its abundant nijtural gardens bordered by sugar cain and pineopple trees., N'aimea Can- yon is a mighty good replica of the Grand Canyon, too!"" Fraternity rushing week has left hini in a daze, he never knew people could be so nice -- calling for him in a car. passing out cigarettes, and making him feel as exhilirated as a rative dancer. All of which brings to mind him his chief regret -- that the little gra.ss shacks and the grass skirts of cinema fame aie non-exist- ent today in his homeland. With his characteristic good humor, h** expliiied that life in Hawaii is not So difTerent from ours. The shag is very popular with the younger set, and the jitterbugs are even more jit- tery. To prove his point he dashed over to the piano and gave a swing jrendition of ""Song of the Island"" and r.'.any of f)ur popular songs. He cmi- cluded his impromptu performance Nvith .<<evei.al native --ongs played in cn original Hawaiian .style. He extended an invittition to tho.se interested in Economics, in which l)e \\ majoring, to come up to Rf)om HO** Robert's Hall for a hull session. .As a parting shot at the fellovs win. arked him about the beverages on the Island he replied, ""The favorite is calle<i okole hau: it's .something like your gin only about 50 times as strong-- but don't ijuote me as an aii- t'nority, I've never tasted it I"""

Problems,"Bucknell's fraternity presidents and lushing ihairmeri met together at the President's Houifie on Sunday after- noon, at the recjuest of Mr. Paul Ilightower, recently appointed Inter- fraternity Council Adviser, to dis- cuss the problems which had arisen among the Greeks during the fust three days of rushing season. Kach fraternity president was handed a slij) of pafier. on which h'^ might make any remarks about the i;t40 rushing camjiaign which he con- sidered worthy of di.scussion. .After all the jiapers had been col- lected, Mr. Hightower discussed the complaints and objections with the group. Lambda Chi Alpha was ac- ciLsed of taking freshmen from din- ner dates with other fraternities, in order that they might attend smokers. The accusation was considered and xgarded as negligible, since the 1940 lushing rules make no stipulation that a rushee must spend the entire evening at any fraternity house, ii.erely because he has agreed to take a dinner date with that fraternity. Sigma .Alpha Epsilon was accu.sed if giving pledge pins to freshmen, but when the representatives of that house asked that the accu.ser prove his .statement, there was no reply from anyone in the meeting, so the charges was dismissed as being (miy the result of gossip. The meeting also <-onsidered other ciiiniilaints and sugjfestions of a le.ss soecitic nature than the aforemention- ed ones, and satisfactory decisions were reache<i, according to the major- ity 'if those present."

Introduced for thost- students who do not wish to open hanking or check- ing accounts locally, but who at the Banie time are in need of"
a,"safe n.ethod of keeping their funds while i>n the campus, the new service will operate through the Cashier's office in Cld Main. Students may deposit their money 1 4 in this office, and withdraw it as they jjlrase by calling at the office for their funds at any time during the <<iaily office hours. This new service is not intended to serve as a substitute fny a bank Ricount. according to Mr. Ranck, and students will not"
he,"permitte<i to v.-rite checks upon their accounts. They may. however, withdraw their n>oney as they desire to do so simpl\'"
by,"presenting themselves at the Cashier's window. Many colleges are now otfering a deposit .""service to their .students in o>>der that they may have some safe place of keeping their cash and still have it available at their conveni- ence. Students are invited to use this service at Bucknell in order to prevent any unnecessary losses, Mr. Ranck declared.

Attitude of the administration and of lfK;al draft boards toward actual conscription of college students re- mains to be seen in actual practice. There seems s<mie basis for the pre diction that the proportion of stu- dents called to camp will not be high. But at any rate conscription is here, despite thousands of lusty 'nays' from hundreds of colleges."

THE,
RAP,
The,
philosophy,of
student,
e;overnment,at
Bucknell,
was,"ptr- fcctly illustrated last night,"
when,
members,of the
Student,Fac- ulty Congress
contested,
Cap,
and,
Dagger's,
choice,of
"""Three",
Men,on a
"Horse""",as a fit play for
campus,
production.,
Argument,on the subject
waxed,"long. loud,"
and,hot.
ranged,
from,the
sublime,"to the ridiculous,"
from,
pure,
hot,
air,to con- structive common
sense.,
But,
always,the central idea
predom-,inated:
"""WHAT",
DOES,
ACCEPTANCE,
OR,
REJECTION,
OF,
THIS,
PLAY,
MEAN,
TO,
"BUCKNELL?""",
Of,course there
was,
partizanship,present in the discussion.
How,could there help
but,"be,"
with,
representatives,
from,every -extra-curricular activity on
campus,in
attendance,at the meet- ing? But this
partizanship,took the
form,of a
demand,"for un- derstanding, rather than of individual bigotry."
Cap,
and,
Dagger,
representatives,
had,no particular cause to be jubilant
when,
they,
heard,the
Council,decree that it did not favor the
play,
which,the
dramatic,
group,has
been,
working,on intensively for the past
two,
weeks.,
Yet,one
representative,of the thespians
made,this
statement.,
"""We",of the
Cap,
and,
Dagger,are not at this
meeting,for the
purpose,of
squashing,the resolu- tion against
'Three,
Men,on a
"Horse"".",
We,
merely,
want,
student,
opinion,
regarding,the
production.,If
'Three,
Men,on a Horse' will injure
Bucknell,ideals
and,"traditions, we"
want,"to scrap it."" Last night's"
meeting,
made,
something,else clear besides the fact that the
Student,
Faculty,
Congress,is
against,
campus,pro- duction of
"""Three",
Men,on a
"Horse"".",It indicated that student
organizations,are willing to reason
with,faculty
and,
administra-,"tion, are willing to"
analyze,
procedures,in an effort to arrive at
mutual,
"understanding,","and. lastly, are willing to"
change,these
"procedures,",even to the point of losing time
and,
"money,",if these
procedures,are not
favored,
by,a
majority,of
Bucknellians.,
Cap,
and,
Dagger,
members,had just cause to be
enraged,last night
when,
Student,
Faculty,
Congress,
disapproved,their
chosen,
play.,
The,
Congress,itself is to
blame,for the fact that the pro- duction must be
discontinued,
"now,",
when,
the,
dramatic,
group,has already spent
two,
weeks,of
work,on
it.,
"""Three",
Men,on a
"Horse""",
was,selected for
presentation,early last
spring.,
Why,didn't the
Congress,state its
opinions,then?
But,
Cap,
and,
Daggerites,
wasted,no tmie arguinj^ over this
point.,
The,die
was,"cast, so there"
was,no use
quibbling,
about,
who,is to
blame,for the
situation.,
The,
representatives,of the
dramatic,
group,took the
Congress',"decision back to their organi- sation, which will act"
upon,it at
some,time in the near future.
Undoubtedly,
"""Three",
Men,on a
"Horse""",will be
scrapped,
because,
Bucknellians.,
through,their
own,
governing,
body,
have,indicated that they do not
want,it.
'ON,
THE,
CAMPUS,by Walton CUtke (OLl
MN,
KK.VCTION,",, It is often said that the only  true way a newspaper man can deter- mint' vhether or not his copy is read is through the criticism or contro- v'l.sy ii arouses unionR his rea<lers. .After la.st week's item on bands, tl'.at niiifht possibly play for this year's big dances, we are sure that this IS the truv* way of discovering whether or not your efTon<< are going to i.iiughi. We were .^wamped with criticism and praise for our selections, and there is nothing that a newspaper staff likes more than criticism and (.raise, because it is a definite indication of the direction in which popu- lar opinion is traveling. If a class conmiittee is to pick a band for a class dame with any degree of assurance that it is the choice of the tntin- .school, it i.-^ absolutely necessary that students express their opin- lon.s. That is just what this writer wants them to do. During the week we were even given the inside information that rone other than .Alex Barthow was already signed to play for the Sopho- more Cotillion, This .seemed (jiiite premature to us as the Sophomore committee hasn't held a meeting as yet to discuss band possibilities, and upon checking with a faculty adviser we found the Baithow story to be a complete myth, .So don't be misled by rumors that a band is already .-igned until you have the word of someone in the know. After some discussion we have come to the conclusion that the two Lands we mentioned for the .Sophomore Cotillion are real material, de- .-^erving the consideration of the Sophomore committee. 0--"
T--,
C--,".SUOOI' It isn't often a newspaperman gets a scoop and can't break it to the public until after it's old stuff. But that's just the prt'dicament this writer is in now. We have a bit of news concerning the Bucknell t^and that we know is a scoop. In fact we are <)uite positive that very few- people outside the band know about this item, but we just can't print it. If we do it will completely ruin the surpri.se the band has in .store for you and you will feel like throwing things. So wc are going to .slay on tiie .safe side and not print a word of the first scoop we have had this year. It breaks our heart to omit it from this issue, but if you go to State on Saturday you will be ac(|uainted with the facts behind this little .scoop, and we will be able to sit back and say smiiRly, ""Wc knew it all the time."" 0--"

It was evident that lack of extensive team play held the Bisonettes back, but they dis- played real flashes of ability on sev- eral occasions.

New York, Pari.s, and Holly- woo<I stvie .setters leceived stiff com- petition from the female element at Beaver Field last Saturday. Topping oflF the female costumes were the huge yellow chrysanthe- mums, symbolic of fall and football, and the bright orange and blue feath- ers of Bucknell, and the purple and white of Penn State. .Scattered among the chic tailored clothes of led, black, and puiph- were various coloreil plaids. .Silks and furs were very scarce while corduroy, velvet, and covert cloth were predominant. .Most .striking of the costumes seen was a full black corduroy skirt and a fireman's red three-<|uarter length swagger coat. .A black bretoti felt hat with a bright red feather was matched with black accessories. .An- other very striking cctstume was worn by a fair-haired Bucknell alumnus. The suit was made of royal purple velveteen. The skirt was very full ciid the jacket, with a high white Collar, tit snugly. The accessories were of a lighter shade of purple. Green and re<l plaids were very predominant. One suit that particii- hiily struck our fancy was a green, red. and yellow Scotch plaid cartlage .-^kirt and a lambs-wool jacket with a lining to match the skirt. This com- bination was topped off by a fiery red felt jockey cap. Another plaid outfit that drew attentir)n was a red an<l black plaid swing skirt with a red cardigan to match over a white silk House. ,As was to be expected jumper dresses of every hue and materia! were seen. Particularly attractive was one of beige corduroy with a crimson bIou.se and crimson acces- sories. .Another combination tha' vas very beioming was a rose skirt and wine jacket with a loose fitting rose fall coat and wine accessories. Now that the gala Penn State game i.s over the co-efls will tuni their t'loughts from chic looking sport cNithing to gowns and access*>>ries fit- ting the infoiuial season, whicli opens .It Bucknell with the first pledge * lance on October 19."

She went on to explain that every- thing is done according to the .sched- ule which President Marion Wein- b> rger, '41, composed after careful study of the work to be done and of the class .schedules of the ten girls who live in the house. In this .sched- ule ^11 the duties are itemized and the work (lunch preparation, lunch clean-up, menu planning, dishes, and dusting) is divided among the ten girls. Saturday is the big clean-up day. Each girl is given a task to perform, such as straightening the linen closet, washing the kitchen fl(H)r, vacuuming, and cleaning the pantry; in order that the work be di.'stributed fairly, the girls alternate on the jobs each week. The only girl who has a per- manent job is Josephine Bagg, '4.'J. v.ho has to tend the furnace. .Sh>> was the only girl present when the furnace was started and theref(>>re she j)rofesses to know just how it should l.e tended. Besides, she runs it so expertly, the girls are glad to give her the opportunity to display her efflcjency. The house consists of a living room, dining room, porch, and kitchen on the first floor and five bedrooms, three of which are u.sed f(>>r study rooms, on the second. The third floor, which was originally the attic, has been converted into sleeping <;uarters and can accommixlate six girls. It has been insulated and the walls have been covered with beaver board. One of the InMlrooms on the second floor contains two double deck beds and the second bedroom is oc- cupied by .Miss Luppert, the house- mother. The living room contains a radio, victrola and piano for the musically inclined, and ""good books"" (they all practically .<<>>houted the latter in uni- .son). .Miss Luppert. who is the adviser, has had much experience working with girls. She was General Secre- tary for the Y."
W.,"EUR. A. and for 2<<) years has done social work, largely in the .Middle West. She is a native of Williamsport. When asked how she liked <<loing this .sort of work, she smiled softly and .said, ""I love it here and I think the giris are grand!"""

During half time the ""Orange and Blue"" Band moved up the field in front of the Bucknell stands, and here the newly organized girls' chorus, each meinln'r using an orange Megaphone, sang ""Co Bisons"". ""Come Bucknell Warriors"" was also sung as the band formed the letter ""B"". Immediately following the appear- ance of the ""B"" Band on the field, Penn State's ""Blue"" Band marched. The Penn State Alma .Mater was played, and the band then fonned the word ""Dad"" in honor of the many Penn .State fathers in the assembled crowd. Although there are imly 21 old members of the band back this year. Bill Starrett, '41, stutlent manager of tne band, stated that the Bucknell Band this year ""is better musically than it ever has been"". Starrett was plea.<ied with the performance of the b;ind at the .State game on Saturday and hopes that performances of this high caliber will be repeated at the coming appearances of the band."

even,
when,

THE,
BUCKNELLIAN,
ARRAIGNS,
THEM.,"by Walton C'loke S('(H>PKf) AM) SrKPRI.SKI).,, ,, .\fter seeing liie Bucknell Bisons slow down a high geared .State team last Saturday, we were in a happy frame of mind, even though a .s.)-called .scoop turned out to be a dud. All of which just goes to show you that if you know anything three weeks before anybody else, it just (loe.sn't pay to keep it under your hat. E.specially in the newspaper business. But all that is just so much water under the bridge at present. We did get a surprise out of the band that we didn't expect, and that wa.s the ihn-i' distinctly different uniforms on the llucknell Drum Majors. The two white uniforms would pass any critical eye, but not that faded oranjfe legalia which one of our baton twirlers had to wear. If we remember correctly, that outfit saw its Iwst days back in ID.JT-.'JX. There was nothing wrong with it then, because there were only two drum major.s and the two different colored uniforms did not present an unbalanced appearance, which is exactly what was presented by two white uniforms and one orange one on the field at State. For the band to make its best appearance on Father's Day and on Homecoming, when they will match their splendor with the Cherry and White of Temple, it is absolutely necessary that a new uniform be pro- cured or that the two drum majors toss a coin to see which one will wear the white uniform. To put our band on the field with unbalance<i color in the front ranks is comparable to going to the opera in overalls, and that is just what it would look like on the field with the natty appear- ing Temple musicians. Of course we realize that when ever suggegtions are made whore money is involved, the persons maicing the suggestions are supposed to put their finger on the source of revenue. This puts us on the spot, but we feel that certainly .some where in our midst the sum of fifty dollars could be procured tr) purchase a new uniform for at least the Temple game. It's an old saying that it's Pa who pays. Well next Saturday is Father'.^ Day. If our memory is also correct, there .should be a uni- form hanging in cold storage in the band room. One that was purcha.sed for a coed drum major last year. The young lady did not return to school and we have a new suit with no one to fill it. Why not sell it, and apply the money toward a new uniform for one of our men. This may also hit a snag as we are informed that one of our men di\im major.s will not be returning to school next fall. Taking all this into consideration, we fee! that it is either necessarx for the two men to toss a coin each time for the privilege of wearing the white suit or simply to alternate at the games for the rest of the .'>>eason. But our best suggestion is a new uniform, because the three drum majors are definitely an asset to our l)and, which in itself was a tremendous .success last Saturday, .standing head and shoulders above the famed Blue Band of Penn State. It was a real |)leasure to compare our band lines with those ol Slate's and find ours the better of the two. The new method of leaving the field used by our band was also received with real acclaim, as it is a speedier, snappier action."

OUR,"NECKS?: With the dill of conscription in our ears, no one is quite certain whethei he is going to graduate from college at all, or if >>t), when. The odds in the gamble we take in registering with the government for military training within the next few years, therefore, is a matter of com- mon interest. They are, (piite hap- pily, very great. Under the existing draft ay.stem it is almost possible to sit back in an armchair with a friend- ly law of averages and smile at Con- grew and the generals -- for a while at any rate."
Govemment,"officials state that from a total of ir.,.V)0,00o registrants, only 400,000 men will be selected for training during the first draft lot- tery. This figure will have a deduc- tion, however, of all the men who have voluntarily enlLsted during the past year. Due to the fact that en- listment has run high recently"

There are at present only 235 eligible men on the campus; the.se fig:ures lead to the deduction that during the first draft, discounting al! exemptions for students in enginepi- Ing and other courses and all those allowed for men who have enlisted in Pennsylvania and the contiguou.. states from which Bucknell draws it? fctudent population, there will be only five men to leave the campus next summer to join apjioinled companies.

The place of the wind-up ma- chine, which slipped into the back- ground when radio became inexpen- sive and efficient, has been taken by a combination of radio and victrola, l)i)pular on the campus in following V ith national popularity. According to local dealers. Buck- mil's record consumption averages approximately 645 new recoidingK and almost a sixth of that number cf used di.scs per week.

The program for the meet will fol- j low along the lines of the usual inter- cfillegiate track and field meet and I will include the regular events of in- tercollegiate   meets. Trials in the field events and the dashes will be / lun off at 4:.30 p. m.. Fridav the 2oth. i , uhile the semi-finals and the long ' di.<<tance runs will be contested on the following afternoon.

A,"I Humphreys, pleaswd with the fighting spirit of his charges against the powerful IJons, has been ^tressing blocking and offensive tac- tics during the past week of concen- trate<l practice. Outcharged by the State footballers last weekend, the Bison gridders know they will have to put more punch into their offen- sive play before they can hope to win ball games. The Herd mentor will make sev- eral changes in the opening line-up this Saturday. Fred Kern will re^ place Chuck Reed at left tackle and either Howie l^onergaii or .lim F'en- rell will take ..ver Charlie Nagel's tackle post on the other side of the line.

Jeanne's official reason, like all the oMie.r flying students, for taking this course in flying, is to aid her coun- tiy in the time of stress. Jeanne hopes however that when .she grad- uates that the taking i>>f this coui^e will aid her in finding a positi<m in the field of .Aviation Publicity. For this course it is necessary for her to put in six hours of land train- ing per week and ^^ hours in the air. Jtanne complains that this program leaves you time for nothing but sleep, classes, and flying, and there is no school cre<<lit given for it. ""You start behind the controls as soon as the plane leaves the ground"", she .savs. The first time that Jeanne >;ot behind the controls she felt over- whelmed, excited, and more than a little frightened. The .sec<ind time she felt about a half inch more con- fident, and Tiow is ""crazy"" about it! Connecticut's Lieut. Gov. James L. .McConaughey has been president of Weslevan Universitv since 1921."

Meeting,
A,"talk by Dr. liewis E. ThaMS, Bucknell's author-professor and head of the Journalism Department, waa the featured event of the last Sigma Tau Delta meeting, held Wednesday, October 9, in the Vaughn Literature"
Lounge.,"- ~*^*^^ ** t, Dr. Theiss has written over thirty books including the well known ""Wings Over the Pacific"", and ""The"
U.,"S. Mail"". With the exception of Yu? late.st book which is a tale o sub- marines, all of his books have had aviation for their main theme, and have usually dealt with the Pan- American"
Airlines.,"*; In contrast to many modern novels, Dr. Theiss explained that his books have been written with a definite edu- cational purpose in mind. Fictional, with realistic detail, they follow thrt news and deal with up to date events ir World History. To bring the writing itself closer to the students. Dr. Theiss displayed some of his original notes, and ex- I'lained the use of other reference jraterial. In order to further the effect of reality in his books, he uses maps to trace various airplane and submarine courses, charting their routes prior to the actual writing of tlie story. ! Dr. Thei.ss' most interesting ex- j|)erience in gathering material for hi^ recent book.  ""The U. S. Submarine"", 1 (leased during the summer, wa.** the Iti.ur which he made through the {United .States Submarine Base at I New Umdon with the cooperation of ithe Navv Department. There, he iv-ent entirely through one of the I submarines which was in drydock, isnd obtained a great deal of iletailed j technical information as w<'ll as an !'f<(uaint;in<e with many nautical 1 1<< rms. j The business of the meeting con- Islsted of the election of new memben^ jvho will be initiated at the next rieeting, November 13. and the ap- pointment of Peggy Pause and Elea- inor Frith as Program and .Sm'ial 1 Chairmen respectively.

ADVERTISINC;,The COLLE(iK
INN,"is an enthusiastic patnm of the advertis- ing facilities of Bucknell's various publications. Our average budget for such piirpo.ses is five dollars a week, which, relatively speaking, is not small change. We are thoroughly sold on advertising, and get nioie than our money's worth in direct returns from such investments. Week after week and year after year, we attempt to give you fresh and interesting copy -- and, believe it or not, we write our own ma- terial. We know that it is not always adequate, but we prt'fer our own ideas in our own language; and .Mr. Britton. at the Print Shop, rectifies mo.st of our mistakes. The editf>rs and managers of the"
BUCKNELLI.A.N,are our per- .sonal friends and our greatest assets in maintaining a healthful busi- ness at the
COLLEGE,

COLLEGE,
"INN,","in her long history, has never done a better business, and we place a wreath of thanks (.n the altar of cumulative advertising dividends. Scanning the"
BUCKNELUAN,"will readily reveal many others who gratefully suppoH Bucknell's publications. But we have never had so much business that we would commit eco- nomic suicide by .scorning our advertising friends. We are not un- mindful of the Administration that has ma^le Bucknell to grow in gritre and sUture and in favor of Phi Beta Kappa and even its high priest. We thank you both, and promise to show our continued grati- tude by becoming .vrvants of all Bucknellians."

i,": by Dick Gray How To Walk The 1 our Mile: Advice to the love-woni, gathered from purely impersonal, unbiased, ob- jective sources, and ai)proved by I ma l.K)vanfuhl, President of the Women's Ccmgress, and "".Skip"" Daits, Presi- dent of the Student-P'aculty Govem- mrnt Association: Walk the entire course of the four- r.ile well before impending date, so that you'll be prepared to answer date's questions such as, ""What's an armor>'?"", ""What's your frateniity I in like-"", and to describe .scenery along road. Don't cut campus, and don't be pirticular who belongs to what park- ed car; this rule is re.stricted to the Freshmen. .Avoid cross-country men, who are hitting the road these F'all after- noons. They're getting in condition; don't demoralize them. Don't talk so much; let the Autumn foliage monopolize the conversation. You'll make 100 percent more head- way. Carry a walking stick. It gives you the appearance of being virile and mas<'uline, and dates are allergic to dogs. Walk facing traffic, on the outside (this clause inserted at the .sugges- tion of Superlative Life In.surance Company), unless it's a blind date and you want to be alone. (These rules passed on and adopt- ed in the ba.sement of Horticulture Hall la.st night). Cheers .And Jeers: We thought we had something when the"
B.,
U.,"cheering section workd out the popular Voo-doo cheer; I'm afraid we were mistaken, at last as far as the technique and prac- tice of the cheer have been carried. Employed almost universally on large college athletic fields, this cheer iray oflTer even greater possibilities than any of our old stand-bys; who- ever interpreted the ""voo-doo"" to the Bi.cknell .student body must have been strictly off-key. The first contact of the majority of our Orange and Blu2 football fans with the cheer came when Bucknell played Georgetown in the Memorial Stadium last year; at this time a fairly small number of G-town fans and the Gray hand open- ed with a monotonous ""voo-doo"" and endtnl with a snappv ""fight-team- fight"". Since Bucknell has taken it over, h( wever, instead of everyone raising and lowering hi>> or her voice with dofinile rhythm to produce a rather unified effect, the stands break out in a rowdy ""voo-voo-doo-<loo"" that >><>und.-- more like a system of organi- zed booing than a polished and efTci'- tive cheer. F.very body 's Doin* It: Back in 184K when a few closely- imited trustees were thinking about f-iunding a college in Lewisburg someone said something about school- ppirit. Without casting any reflec- tion on the previous ninety-three .stu- dent bodies at Bucknell, we might say that 184(? was about the furthest this idea ever got. The F'reshman cheering .section is a good idea; the Booster Club haj>> .iccomplished its purpose as far as it has gone; Bucknell banners are still selling down-town, and still a lot of i:s df)n't realize what school spirit is. Tn some cases school spirit calls for singing the Alma .Mater and weeping a few minutes in memory of old Bucknell; in other instances it re- cfuires stepping outside of our own 3(H1 acres for a minute and recogniz- ing the existence of other colleges in the United States. T refer to an in- stance which occurred last .Saturday at the Bucknell-Ursinus Dad's Day gnine. In the first place, the touch- dowTi Ursinus scored was niade in all faith ti> their Almn Mater; we should not havr- begrudged them the i;eve.' j/oints or if so not out loud. In the Fr<<'ond place. would have been the aiijuopriate song after this score was made, and not ""Go Bisons""."

Terrors,"b) Hub Morrison When the Hisons travel to Balti- more this coming Friday evening to engage the Western Maryland war- rior in battle, American style -- it will mark the ninth meeting of the two schools on the gridiron in the last two decades, (twenty years). Never, thus far in the previous eight games, has any prediction on the outcome of the games been very accurate. Western Marvland has just disregarded any Bi.son reputation, and Las always provided stiff opposition, an<l in three of those eight games has emerged victorious. In 19.'{9. a good Bucknell year, the Green Terrors came out ahead 14-13. That year the Bions licked Temple, A'illaiutva, l^afayette, and"

One year later, the fall of ll'2.'j, the Bison.s again chalked up a win; this one to the tune of 17-0. However 192fi was a different story, and the Terrors rolleil up 40 counters to wallop the Bisons with the biggest score thus far registered in the list of battles. In 19,S2, a poor Bucknell season, the Lewisburgers romped home with the bacon, taking the measure of the Westminster. .Md. boys 14-13. The next season was the time for the Marylanders to reverse the tables, winning by the same mar- gin. In '34 the Green and Gold won their third '.ictory. Th<< last two game.s played h ive been Bison wins. In 1935 it waa 'J-O, with Bucknell on top; and last year Kiick, Pegg, Funair, & Co., stonuped a.'l over the invading Terror hojxie, winning by a margin of 32-6. It was (<ne of the three victories in an other- wj.se poor season for the Bisons. Bucknell leads in the matter of points scored, having chalked up 85 counters to 7<J scored by the Terrors. Batting .(525 with their five wins, tha Bisons are facing a Bcjuad that's com- ing up strmig. Coach Havens hac iiKstilled in his charges a .strong and fast ground game, with good buckers and an .A 11-. Maryland back, Lester Knepp. The team is well rounded and will be hard to halt.

It had previously been the belief of this editorialist that the protection of the interests of minorities is one of the most in- tegral and primary functions of a democracy, and that suppres- sion of minorities is usually the keynote for the advent of totali- tarianism. Yet he finds that this conviction has been ^"
wrong,one. according to this week's letter to the editor. For one
whole,week
--,seven long days
--,the writer of last week's editorial watched a scab heal over the sore that had been
opened,
when,Cap and
Dagger,voted on scrapping
"""Three",
Men,on a
"Horse"".",
Expectantly,he waited for the minority in that organization
who,"are ""activated by a desire for the intellectual"
advancement,and diversion of the general public to defend their
#cause.,
He,listened to disgruntled carping and caviling by a few dissenters
who,"muttered vague 'imprecations* against indi- -viduals, and failed to advance one sensible"
argument,in favor of their convictions.
The,sore
seemed,"to be healing nicely, from all outside appearances, but Caj) and Dagger's obvious desire to *'forgct and forgive"""
seemed,to indicate pretty conclusively that all was not sugar and cream
among,"the dissenters, and that a scab"
was,
forming,"over proud flesh. So, failing at other forms of finding out the truth,"
"""The","Bucknellian"" arraigned the dis- senters, boldly and baldly."
"""What's",the matter with the die-hards

L,", DurinK the pant week there ambled out of the limbo of things past, a vajfiiely familiar idea that has beei\ pu.shed to preat heightji in the short space uf (ine week. Inteifraternity Ball. Yes, Bucknell is back on the old subject. Shall we have an Interfrateniity Ball or would it be be.st to forget the matter entirely. That is the .stajce the idea has reach- ed for several years, but action was never taken to carry it any further. Not 80 this year! Fraternity men have come to the realization that colleKe life just isn't college life without an Interfraternity Ball."
A,"<-(>>mniittee uiidei tlie direction of faculty adviser on college social affairs, Donald Stillinan, has placed the idea on a sound basis foi the first time, with the full support of the fraternities, and plans for the realization of a dream are now in progress. Of course there is the little matter of money that always rears its ugly head over such a proposition. The eleven social fraternities on the Bucknell campus will have to bear the brunt of the financial burden, which will really be a burden for some houses to carry. The plan as it stands at present calls for a big name band to su))ply the music, which will be all very Rood if the fraternities can supply the major amount of the financial assistance needed. The way conditions stand at present the very least the fraternal organizations would have to contribute would be $,')0.00. The balance of the money {\<r the ordies- tra would have to be made up in the sale of tickets to non-fraternity members, as all fraternity men would be admitted free."
A,"date for the dance is also a factor that proved to be a headache in the past. The college .social calendar is generally so full, that another social event just can't be crowded in at a suitable time. Ijist year it was suggeste<l that the campus Greeks give up one night of their annual .>^|)nng houseparty for the purpose of sponsoring an Interfraternity Ball. This plan met with such denounciation that it was dropped, and aftei' such a display of disapproval it is unlikely the .same sugge.stion will be made again this year."
A,"dat*' that really .seems to offei the best possibilities for the affair is the Friday of Home.-oming Weekend. Not only would it be a<'ceptable tM the fraternities, but it would offer an added attraction to alunmi and present added entertainment for the weekend. .\t present all plans are still in the formulating stage, and nothing definite as to date, bantl, or assessment has been decided. Thr fraterni- ties themselves will have the final .say as to whether the ball will oi- will not be held. It does .seem that Bucknell University should have an In- terfraternity Hall as this attraction is an annual affair oti most college campuses from coa.st to coa.st."

Time I for registration througiiout the country was set at from 8 to  10 minutes. I The Bucknell coed registratiim boanl did it in five minutes, with a great I Lig smile for a bonus. Many of the out of state liu<knellians and those I iioiii the laige cities can be thankful that they didn't have to register at ( home where registration lines were blocks long, and you stood in line for two hours before you were able to give your name, your age, color of ey< r. color of hair, identification marks, and your home address. Yes, if y(>>u signed that little card you're irt the army now. Bui if yoi^ had any objections before you signed they're gone now. When you hear a radio announcer .say that Uncle Sam has HJ.OOO.flOO young men ready to do his bidding you get that prickly feeling at the back of your neck, just as you do when you .see the .American flag. You wonder how that figure 1(;,0(K>>,00() looks to a couple of dictators, who think they have a large army with two million men in the field. Yes. it's ureal In be an .-vnuTican, and you ar;^ ready to defend that i)rivilegc."
LETTER,
TO,
THE,
EDITOR,
I,btar .Sir: If dictatorship hasn't hit the Buck- nell campus
I,"miss my guess. In substantiation of this declaration, al- low me to quote from the editorial entitltHl ""Put Up or .Shut Up"", issue of October 10, in reference to the 2'i recalcitrant Cap and Daggerites who refused to submit, though clearly de- frated by the margin of two sturdy votes. ""What was the matter with the diehards who formed such a min- *irity"
7,"Was their vote motivated by n.ere cussedness, or do they object to the present functioning of Bucknell Student Government?"" If that sen- tence doesn't smack of the suppres- sion of individual .self-expression pre- valent in Germany and Italy, I'll eat n-v dink. Since when must a dis- ;-enting mmority (assuming, brazenly encmgh, that we live in a democracy) l-e motivated by either ""cussedness"" or subversive desires. Isn't it en- tirely possible that the minority might he activated by a desire for the intellectual advancement and di- Nersion of the general public. .And might not the minority be better in- formed regarding its own problems than a judiciary body which could find n<<> rnoTf concrete delin<|uency within the play than its ""unsavory reputati<m"". Think of the incredible pettiness of that .statement. Whal an index the Congress couUl comjiile if its investigation penetnited no deeper than the ""reputation"". Zola. Preiser. Daumier .Shaw. Kinsein. Col- umbus. Copernicus, St. Paul. Moses -- :ill would be rejected."
I,"i-uote again. ""It would have bt-en i\ case of puic suicide 011 cam- pus for the dramatic <irganization. had they voted otherwise, because ot t!i>>' administrative omnipotence of Student Faculty Congres.-^ de<-rees"". In that ea.se, I cast one vote for sui- cide--at least it would be ""pure"". If i;f(. -- as it is euphemistically desig- nated on the campus-- consists in genuflecting to ""admini.strative om- nipotence"", it isn't worth the con^'omi- tant tribulations and disgust. Dear oditor consider this m-rely i;s a hypothesis tn play with. The Student Faculty Congress is merely i figurehead. It does not truly nprf- sent uninf1iM'tu-<<-<l <<tiiil""n< ninnii.'i."

Bill,"AsHoiMated Collei^iate PreKs The pulse of America's collegians is (luickening. It will be an interest- ing study, when things have returned to a more normal state, to analyze the swing in collegiate opinion dui ing the months when congress was debating and passing the conscription bill. Comment of the Daily Athenaeum at West Virginia university is typi- cal: ""Strangely enough, the consen- sus on the campus ha.s changed con- Fiderably since last spring. Many who were then opposed to conscrip- tion are now in favor of the draft"". The Athenaeum also observes that American youth has no argument with p<M)ples of any land and would rather spend its energy in friendly rivalry of sports ""BUT"
YOUTH,
IS,"READY"". .At Ti<^>>uisiana State I'niversity, the Daily Reveille urges ""a vote of confi- dence to our congressional leaders v^ho finally secured passage of the con.'^>ription bill."
Why,"should we rot have selective service when the imminent black clouds of war are shadowing every phase of liberty de- Hign<<'<l by peace-loving peoples?"" At East Texas State Teachers col- lege, the East Texan believes that the munitions makers are now satisfied, and that ""they smile as they run their hnnd in their pocket to feel the place that will hold those fat, juicy profits"". But the Texan adds that ""from past, d.'monstrations of patriotism on the campus, it is evident that all stu- dents will answer the call and that they will be glad to defend their country"". WTiile admitting it is ""natural enough"" that some college men should not favor the draft law, the College Exponent at ^ay.'iville (N. D.) State Teachers college warns the public rot to ""get the wrong opinion of this college youth. The majority believe in militar>- training for the defense of our country. No class of youth is more patriotic or loyal to these United States"". ""Conscription should be hated"", de- clare<l the Brown University Daily Herald, ""but it should not be shun- ned. We should u.se it in the same way we use a dangerous and distaste- ful medicine when the body must be protected from the onslaught of a deadly di-sease"". .Analysis of nationwide collegiate opinion reveals considerable support for the view expres.sed by the .Alliga- tor at the Univ. of Florida: ""Con- scription is a sacrifice worth making"
BO,"long as the conscripted defend -- rot offend, invade or .<>>eek to con- quer"". Echoing this warning is the Dartmouth, which fears ""there may he a danger in the spirit that runs througrh it all. If we do not intend to find our own war."
we,"had best keep the fact in mind. If our talk of war against the principles of fas- cism is sincere, it would <lo no harm no fight it at home with action and words."
.A,"beaten-up Jehovah's Wit- ness makes unconvincing copy f<ir an anti-facism crusade."" Thus the nation's .student youth ac- cepts the principle of conscription, villing to sacrifice when neces.sary but on the alert to .*afeguard historic libei-ties. The 1940 .Senior Tribunal swung into Hclion again Monday night when it heard and pas.sed sentence upon 12 I erring freshmen. ' The Tribunal's judge.s handed down jniany excellent early decisions. Sev- eral   Fro.sh who had not found time jto learn the Bucknell Alma Mater [weie given the opportunity to render I srtlos at conspicuous places and at nuspicious times. No normal person should want to repeat such a duty two weeks in succession; however, if soinecme shows that he desires an- other  meeting with the board, it is customarily arranged by the quali- fied  sophomores. Such acts as not wearing the dink, cutting campus, not greeting other I'ucknellians, an<l other breaches of Tucknell traditions, are not general- ly tolerated by the body of judge.<>> v;hich convenes every Monday night."

Me- teorology and navigation are the fields emphasized in Professor Gar- tnan's pround course class, which meets each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evening from 7:00 to 9:00. .At present, studies have been tem- poraril\- suspended because of a de- If.y in the relea.se of government text- books. Meanwhile, the time has been devoted to a .^tudy of civil aeronau- tics regulations and to the theory of flying under the tutelage of Mr. Reiber.

This,is one of the

questions,in the

students,
during,the
days,of their
matriculation,at
Bucknell.,
But,
during,the past four years an
organization,on

constantly,been
grow-,ing in the
power,to
answer,"that question, positively"
and,satis- factorily.    This
organization,is the
Bucknell,

Established,in the
years,
when,a college student's
hopes,of
getting,a substantial position
upon,
graduation,
were,as slim as
are,
those,of
Roosevelt,for
balancing,the
national,
"budget,",the
Bureau,
proved,"itself a flourishing,"
though,
perhaps,
undernour-,"ished infant,"
and,has
grown,in
power,
and,
scope,in spite of the
economic,
adversity,
prevailing,in the
country,"at large, until this"
year,
the,
"organization,",
with,a well
designed,
job-securing,"pro- gram, has laid plans for the"
most,intensive
and,effective activity in its history.

The,
Week;,

ON,
THE,
-,
CAMPUS,by \Nallou (.loke PULniUAL
BAITI.EFKONT,"With national election day less than two weeks uway, there are thousands of college students, who for the first time in their life can take advantajfe of their 21 years, and cast their vote in a presidential election. Hut how will they cast it? Do they know who they want to vote for- Does it make any difference to them who wins the coming election? Are they influenced by their parents as to which party will receive their support? These are all important questions, and the ma- jority of college .-itudents pass over them lightly, with little thought of what changes a presidential election may bring about. But is it entiiely the student.-; fault if he is uninterested in the ptditieal aflfairs of the nation? It seems that instead of enlightment for the Amtrican public all there is in evidence right now is befuddle- njent. How are you going to cast yoiir ballot when you realize th.it it is a fact, that both presidential candidates are actually Democ-rats, and both vice presidential candidates are Republicans. How can an old line Republican or an old line Democrat vote for a combination like that. There is a great percentage of voters, who are old timers at this voting l>ropositioii who can't make up their minds. Of course you can .say, ""Vote for the two best men"", but how njaii\ dyed in the wool Republi- cans or Democrats will cast their ballot for the opposing party leader because they think he is the better of the two men. Very few! Even if many of the old line voters thought their candidates were not as cap- able as those of the opposition the\' would still vote for the men nomin- ated <m their party ticket. Students are further confused by the fact that an analysis of both party platforms reveals that they Hre practically the same ii' every re- spect. In fact there is a professor on the Bucknell campus who will give any member of his das.s an"
A,"for a final grade, if that person can show him three distinct differences in the platform of the two major j)oIitical parties. What is the student voter supposed to do in a case like this. The professor, who made this statement, is ready to back it up with the"
A.,"Can the college student show three disinct differences in the two major political paities? It is highly probable that he can't. Can any- one in the country .sh(>>w three .separate and distinct differences in the two party platforms? It is highly probable that they can't. Then how can the college student judge the two parties on this basis'.' H<<)W can the old experienced voter base his convictions on the platforms. It doesn't seem rea.sonable that either can convince themselves that they shouki vote f(>>r one party or the other on the evidence presented by the two platforms. Parental iiitluence will undoubtedly have the >fieatest effect on th"" students casting their first ballot for president of the United States. If the parents are Rej)ublicans, it is nine chances to one that the student will vote Republican, and the .same applies if the parents are Democrats. This seems an easy way out for some students. It saves delving into the facts of the two parties and their candidates, to try and decide for yourself who you want to vote for. It's the easy way out to say my parents are Republicans and .so am I, or my parents are Democrats and so am"
I.,"But this methml does not enlighten the student, in any way, on the true facts of the campaign. One definite difference that dots arise is the fact that one man is ixinning foi a third term and the other isn't. If a college .student is lo<>>king for a life line before casting his vote this is it. He can say that he i.*; against precedent breaking in the office of the president of the United States. What wa.- good enough lor Wa.<<<hiiigton is good enough for him. Three terms will lead to distatorial powers. Yes, for average person or the college student casting his first vote that IS a life line. It IS something definite. The rest are ju.st ideas that are intangible. Taking everything into account most of .America will go to the polls on election day and vote Republican or DenK)cratic simply becau.se their grandparents and their parents were always Democrats or Republicans, and that simi)le fact alone will sway thousands and thou.'^nds of votes.

I didn't havt- to use pops stiff shirt front as it was what they call semi-formal. Which means that the girl wears a long dress and 1 wear my other suit. You can also tell Pop that after last Satunlay my piggy bank ain't jingleing any more as I had to pay my fraternity bill, have my pant.- pressed, and my coke bill for the week was %\.0T>, all of which leaves me in a predicament that my economics prof might call ""financial embar- ras.>-infst"". To makek it simple Mom I ain't broke but am I badly bent. Tell Pop-FATCSIAA for me. If you remember, .Mom, I said that the upper classmen made the Frosh toe the mark. I was wrong. Mom, they art>> making ine eat the mark, and a few of my words, too. They have a flock of guys what do nothin' but look for my errors in campus mannerisms. All of which means that as .soon as I .""step on the gra.ss, or say nuts to the Senior Tribunal, they have a paddle caressin' my po.sterior or I trots around the campus with a bird cage on my head, not to mention a sign which says, ""I was a wise bird and the Tribunal caged me"". At times its down right discouraging Mom, but I think I'll sur\ive. Tell Pop I j)ut a little scratch <m one of the fenders on the car last week. Also tell him not to worry because you won't be able to see it as the garage man says he can put on a new fender for .?1S.(K). which is certainly :i bargain on lenders.

Editor,
Bucknell's,
First,
Citizen,"Letter to Secretary of Student Fac- ulty Congress. Dear .Miss Outman: I have yuur note about boosting attendance at ""The I.ate Christopher Bean"". I shall certainly attend if I am in town that evening. 1 appreciate very much the action \\bich Cap and Dagger took in an en- deavor to .select a play which is in keeping with Bucknell ideals and feel more enthusiastic about .supporting them than ever. With be.st wishes for a successful play. Yours sincerely, Amaud C. Marts."
S.,
F.,
C.,
Chief,"Dear Sir: Recent editorials and letters to the editor have produced enough arraign- ments to effectively cloud the issue of the recommendation by the Student F'aculty Congress to Cap and Dagger conceming the play, ""Three .Men on a Horse"". For the sake of any per.sons who may he interested and who are now .somewhat puzzled about the whole af- friir. let us look at the issues involved. It seems that S. F. C. has been criti- cized on two counts:"
L,"'The Congress itself is to blame for the fact that the pro'<ucti<m must be discontinued now, when the dra- matic group hag already spent two weeks of work on it. ""Three Men on a Horse"" was selected for presen- tation early Ia.st spring. Why didn't the Congress state its opinions then?"" 2. The recommendation by"
S.,"F. C. to Caj) and Dagger for reconsider- ation of their play is interpreted as being tantamount to a decree by S. I- C. In regard to the first criticism, it will be noted that .Student Faculty Congress's <luties do not include the 'okaying"" of plays selected by Cap and Dagger, but it is certainly Con- gress's concern to give voic to any student opposition on this subject v/hen the student opposition has cry- .>.talli/e<l to the point of making itself htard by the .student governing body. This opposition opinion was not heard b\ S. F. C. last spring. Objections were not discovered until one day be- fore the special meeting of S. F. C. was called to act as a sounding board for student opinion in this matter- to bring out into the open any hidden rnmHings- -to give the student gov- erninu body a chance to debate openly both sides of the f|Uestion. As a result of this debate S.  K. C. made its recommendation to Cap and DaKgPi- with the perfectly clear un- derstandinK that C. and D. was to weigh the evidence presented in th>>' (Congress meeting along with evidence gathered independently by"
C.,"& P. and then to decide for itself the fate of ""Three Men on a Horse"". The fact"
I,"that 23 persons in C. and D. wer<< I opposed to abandoniuK its pro<iuction [would show that the CongreBs's rec- ommendation was not considered tan- Itamount to a decree. j It might be interesting to not<< what Professor Willard Smith wrota : in a i-ecent letter to the executive committee of Student Faculty (^n- ^ress. He wrote, ""In spite of all the 'novel reporting in the Buckneilian and the magnificent arraignmenta, I still think the S. F. C. managed its theatrical debut with dignity and fajme.ss. The new show is coming along excellently."" The tackling of controversial issue* by the student governing body is a aign of healthy democratic procedure, we believe. But when consideringf such issues, it will be necessary for all of us to keep clear-eyed and clear headed, retaining our long-range per- spective. In the meantime, let us all support with our attendance the splendid ef- forts of the Cap and Daggerites to produce under a terrific time handi- cap the play. 'The I.ate Christopher Bean"". Be seeing you at the play this weekend. President, Student f-aculty Congress."

d'Arc,"Dear Editor: You want to know why Cap and Dagger's ""minority"" doesn't defend its attitude on the ""Three .Men on a Horse"" (iue.stion. Primarily because Cap and Daggerites are intensted in jre-senting plays and not in re-hash- ing dead issues just to provide copy for the Buckneilian. It wa.sn't neces.sary for  the twenty- three voters to ""qualify their objec- tions to the reconimendation of the .-tudent government"". No loyal mem- ber of Cap and Dagger wanted to give up a good plav. which had months of planning and a week of re- hearsal behind it. By loyal membeM 1 don't mean just the 23 who voted against the recommendation. Most of the })eople who voted for it wanted to give the play, but they reali/.^'d it was impossible. Tht- recommenda- tion to reconsider was merely a tact- lul way of telling Cap and Dagger they couldn't pre.sent ""Three Men on a Hor.se"". However, once ""Three Men on a Horse"" was discarded, members of Cup and Dairger didn't start crying about injustice and their ruined plans. .As far as thev were con.'cnied ""Three Men on a Horse"" was a thing of the piisl. The impfirtaiit thinu .'ihead w.is i)roduiing 'The l,at>>' Christopher I><an"" an<<l making up the loss of two weeks of valuable working time. Fi go away, and pick your quarrels with .someone else.

"MEYER,",
'06,"Scan'ely another Lewisburg home has been so intimately and prominently associated with Bucknell history as the Stoughton home on .Market Street. Like the Wolfe and Shorkley home, the Weiden- saul home, now the site of the Federal Building, the Follmer home on North Fifth Street, and many others, Bucknell boys were mothered in times pa.st. Fine, matronly women looked after us as their own sons, and their hospitality and generosity and motherly advice was an out- standing contribution to the Bucknell life of an earlier day. Frank Stoughton, a Civil War veteran and superintendent of one of the .Jivisions of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and .Mrs. Stoughton, born in the south and partly educated in Lewisburg, were the parenUs of five daughters and three sons. Mrs. Stoughton, with a heritage of southern hospitality and comeliness, was a mother devoted to her church, her home and family, and a large circle of choice friends; like Walter Hill, one .tf her sons-in-law, they loved her as their own"
mother.,"Every member of the family has attained distinction by marriage or profession. The daughters have reigned as queens of prominent homes of America, and the sons in important positions in business life. ___ Anne Stoughton, u leader in church and civic affairs in Lewis- burg, has chosen to maintain the spachjus family home, and has been ;; con.stant ho.stess to innumerable relatives and friends. Elizabeth .Harried Dr. Peter Cregor. a successful doctor in Philadelphia. wh.)se s.)n. ""Jack"", is one of our fine young Bucknellians and a rapidly-rising oculist in New York City. Rebecca Stou.sfhtoii .narried Walter Hill, son of David Jane Hill, f.trmer Piesident .if Bucknell and Ambassador to Germany and inti- mate ass.)ciate of President Wilson along with Tasker"
H.,"Bliss, an- other Bucknellian and Chief of .Staff of the United Slates Army dur- ing the W.irld War. Walter Hili is a member of an outstanding law firm in Scranton. which also includes two sons of another former Hucknell Piesident. John Howard Harris -- Reese and Herbert Harris. Walter Hill, Jr., is an.ither fin.- Bucknell boy and on.j of oiir good I'.-iends. Jane Stoughton married ""Christy"" Mathewson, pitcher for the N.'w York Giants in several World .Series. '*Christy"", in character an.l repute, with a clean mind and heart, is probably the gieatest hero in niiKiern times to ail lovers <d' competitive sp.)rts. Undoubtedly he .)wed much of his success to this fine Chri.stian home and, worthy of mention, the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity, which has turned out so many n.itable Bucknell graduates. Young Chri.sty Mathewson was <me .)f our personal fiiends and a fn'.iu.-nt visitor at the College Inn with his nuinerons cousins. Margaret St.)Ughton married Henry Meyer, a w.jrthy peer to any of his famous brothers-in-law. We will conclude this article with a tribute to his fine life. Thomas Stoughton. an executive of one of the large tire com- panies, was the father .if "".Al"" Stoughton. a l.mg-time tenant of the College Inn, and fre.|uent host t.i all the Stoughton descendants. "".Al"" was our fir.st full-time .Alumni .Secretary an.l Editor. He is still .ngaged in publicity work, in which field he has unusual talents. "".Al"" discovered and encouraged .Mr. Reynold Packard, who is now Associ- ated Press manager in Rome, and a very dit=tinguished war correspond- ent in his own right. Frank Stoughton. a civil engineer, was unfortunately killed in a tiain wreck. .Augustus Stoughton. the only living brother, is a large contrac- tor in the s.iuth, some of his pre.sent work including the expa.ision of 41 Federal penitentiary for w.imen. jiresided over by Dr. .Mary Belle Harris, a pris.m .ifticial of whom Bucknell is very proud. Perhaps this is a lather long approach for the real subject mat- ter of this article; but it is all interesting to a host of Bucknellians and is inten.led as a well-desened tribute to an honored family. We l.'lt any other verbal mute would have been i. .adequate without first giving you a little historical background to a beloved member of a veiy distinguished Bucknell family. Henry .Meyer attracted .)ur attention as an outstanding senior. Even as each Faculty member, to a green freshman, is a god himself, so the might.\ -eniors are nothing less than de.ni-gods. Henry Mey.-r, t.igeth. r with Charley Grimminger, a long-time ba.seball hero at Bucknell. always constituted the head of the table wherever they .-;at. (""barley G.-in.minger later earned his Ph."
D.,"in Ge.^nany; ever since, ho has been head of moden. languages in the .Altoona High i^chooi. Whether in class.oon.s .ir in bulj sessions, their keen min.ls were always in evidence. Beside a lot .'f time devoted to friendly di.s< ussions and social intercourse, Henry spent much time in the Buck- nell Library, not as a matter of necessity, but because of his own volition he learned to love books. Confirming our own opinion of Henry Meyer, he was immedi- ately drafted after graduation as a member of the Bucknell .Academy faculty. That was the custom at Bucknell for many years, under Dr. Harris, in building up his great faculty. Later they were advanced tu college .stature and given leaves of absence fir advanced studies and higher degrees. Henry later left his teaching caieei- to become unoftuial dean and father-confessor to the high .school principals through a large part of Penn.sylvania. He became an outstanding authority and adviser to .ill teachers in his field, and in most instances his judgment on the best texts wa.-* the final authority. Many a textbook of his competi- t<irs was iet;oinmended in preference of his own, but Henr>-'s honesty and fairness never lost him many sales, and gained for him many other friends who more than compensattni him for his few lost sales. Henry Meyer was great because he was gentle, because he was modi'st. and because of his poi.-^e and unfailing kindness and courte.sy. He was ahvay.s interested in the other fellow, and in losing his own life in unselfish .service to many otheis, he found him.self again in the respe<:t and love with which everyone regarded him. His ta.stes dif- fered in some respects from those of his gotxi wife, but a m.)re devot- ed couple it would have been hard to find. He took the prosaic thingrs of life and raised hem to high honor and .iignity."
A,"great man has gone from our midst; a fine scholar and gentleman. And your absence brings sadness to a great host of friends. Professor Rhodes and Pro- fessor Drum, and your many other friends and associates could never speak highly enough of you. We are distressed for you. Henry Meyers; very plea.sant and kind have you been to us. Tt seems only yesterday that we first met. and once more we realize that life is jmM. a fleeting shadow. As for man, his days are as gras.s -- as a fiower of the field, so he flourishes. But the wind passes over it and it is gono, and the place thereof shall know it no more. But the memory of your good life will always remain green and fragrant with us. Goodbye jipd bon voyage. Henry, until we meet again. -'#'"

He entered Buck- nell as a student in 1S<<?7 and was uraduated in 1S72, his undergraduate Vork having bi>>en interrupted by e' ents which prohibited him from at- tending   college for four consecutive vears; however, when he grailiiated 1-.^ had completed work which would l.jive normally taken seven years to f.< rform.

Meets,"hy Jean Shake Our pretty little freshman i-o-wls are in their K'ory today. For the past four days they have been dash- iriff to and from their classes wearing the iioii.sensical costumes that have become a tradition of Bucknell. The only imrt that annoyed the frosh to any jircat extent was the exhibition of the natural shininjj fountenance.>*. The administration, because of the oomplaints of parents last year, pre- ierre<<l that the jiirl's ha/inK be pat- terned after that of the male frosh. However, the sophonmre women just couldn't bear to have the freshman deprived of the fun of ""Hell Week"", and So they compromised. The accessories which the neophyte co-eds have been wearing since last Monday, were removed forever Wed- nesday niiifht with much gaiety; how- ever there is one little item that must be worn until the next home jrame on November 23. The item to which we refer is the hupe crepe-paper bow, decorating the back of the head and flapping in the breeze, which diatin- K'liishes tlie Frosh from al! other co- eds. The rules concerninpr speaking 1 1 and huldinff doors for all upperdass women, the singinpr of the Alma Matei- ami the recitation of all cheers on rtM|uest, compulsory attendance at till pep rallies, and no campus cutting: vill also hold until N'ovembe 2.3. The female neophytes have also been given another set of rules, that will hold good for the Homecoming Game only. There is to be no fresh- man girls in the stadium outside of the freshman section or with a date. They will faithfully wear their lovely orange bows and carry miniatun' blue n'egaphones adorned with an oiit- sandin^r orange ""B"". The hazing of the"
men,is being copied in another
way.,"In.stead of the Women's Sophomore Tribunal n'eeting just once at the close of 'Hell Week"" as it has in the past, it will hold its regular meeting for un- f.nished business every Monday nighi.

Returning,
Alumni,
Saturday,"One (>>f the fiist things to greet Cucknell alumni returning for Home- coming will be the Bucknell band, comprised of .'>tl boys and 24 girls, ltd by three talenteii drum majors. Besides marching in the parade, two new letter formations and a sptnial formation for the alumni will he 'xecuted at the Tem))lf' game, Tt is interesting to note that this bucknell musical group was organiz- ed in 1891 by Professor Simp.son of the Physics Department. He was a student at that time and became le.ider of the group, which was then com7)rised of 2<i men. Not only did this new musical organization play at pep rallys and football games, but they performed also at political parades. In 1892. when Grover Cleve- land was elected president, some of the townspeople asked Professor Simpson if he would lead the band hi a parade. This h*- consentfd to do, only after receiving .SR.OO for each of the 20 men. The parade started at 2 a. m. and lasted for two and one- half hours. Since that time the band iia.< had Trany interesting experiences, and the organization itself has grown and im- proved greatly. Entrance require- rents are now very rigid. Twenty-six fre,shmen have been ad- TiNtted this year"
who,"will make a sizeable nucleus for the next four ytars. Musical antl drill rehearsals have been very successful, as have. also been the field maneuvers. This year, too, the band will go to Wash- ijigton for the George Wa.shington game. As this has never l)een done before it will be an r>>utstan<ling oc- casion  for the group."

Thinl. we have all given much earnest thought to the issue involved in the anti-third term tradition. We realize the value of maintaining th"" firms of democracy in times such as the.se. But far above this con.sider- ation, in our opinion, is the need of battling for the substance of democ- racy.    We feel ( 1 I that true democ racy means that the electorate should ! b<<' free to ca.st its vote for whomever it plea.ses; (2i that a minority is at- ! tempting to use the atiti-third term [tradition as a means of forcing the n'ajioit.v to accept its will; and Ci) I that the re-election of Presiden' !

I,"we wish whenever we wish, we are jr.o hniger a free pi-ople. Election of & ne^v president would paralyze the goveniment for six months, which is 'what the dictators want. Fourth, we .should like to point out that in this time of unprecedented V orld crisis, when .America is by common agreement facing the grav- e.xt dangers of its entire history .there is no other question in this campaign so pressing as the simple one of whether Mr. Roosevelt or Mr. Willki- ; will best be able to guide our nation through the storm.

Somehow, student b'xly elections never seem to work out to anyone's .satisfaction. To make the choice more truly rep- resentative of Bucknell, all seniors, men and women, will be given ballots containing the names of every senior giri. Of the list, each senior will choose six, no more than three to be pitked from any one affiliated group. Eighteen girls having the most votes will con.stitute the group from which Mr. Powers will choose six. Don Ross will photograph the girls. The balloting must be completed by Wed- nesday, November IS.

At Venice, which famous city is built on 117 islands, the car is lift in the garage a huge building which constitutes the city's sole auto parking site. Venice's ""main street"" is the Canal Grande which is navigated by gon- dolas. The influence of Mussoltni's mcKleniization has lent what migh' be judged a more civilized touch to the 'aiiuatropolis'.

University,
According,to Statistics by John Lawrence .Appro\iniately .'{.^tO students receive aid from the University throughout the year at Bucknell. The primary sources for this income are: \.
V.,"A. .it'bs. Bucknell work aid, dining de- 'partment. endowe<l scholarships, de- I ferred tuitions, departmental jobs, nnd miscellaneous"
jobs.,"With the exception of departmental jobs, a total of ?:!8,84r).00 will be earned by the students from the above sources this year. It is interesting to note that, in n-idition to the university aid, there are many other sources of income for Bucknell students. The Bucknellian cnyiloys seven"
men,
who,receive :i total of ?4r>n.n(i for the year. The College Inn. which gives work to six sJudi-nts. arranges for room and toard for four of the men and board for
two.,"George's gives full boarj to four students and part board to two. .Another source of income lies in the Student Book Store which has ^'rown considerably in the past two years, thus employing more students."
A,"large, but inestimable, number of jobs is offered by the fraternities i.n the campu.<. In the past two years most of the houses have given !iid to freshmen football players, in the support of the plan instituted by Coach Humphreys. F.ach fraternity employs waiters from among the members of the house. Usually the oflRces of treas- urer an caterer are remunerative to the men who hold them. Two houses have pressing machines which giv [employment to several students. In [several houses individuals earn their I spending money as agents for laun- ;dry concems or by maintaining can- tiens which supply cigarettes, candy, soft drinks, and other article;*. I Two newspaper agencies, the New York Herald Tribune and the \'ew , York l^mes. both run by students, are a substantial means of support. Some enterprising students havi^ found unusual means for earning spending"
money.,"Last year, one Bucknellian .sold neckties which were made by his mother. Another ad- Ivertised that he would make fresh- !man signs and posters for any occa- sion. .Still others have sold maga- zines and books. .According to unofficial information. about five hundred students (approxi- i.iately 40''. of the student body) are .#working their way through Bucknell -- a few, completely; the rest, par- 'tially.

I,'The Ability of Feeling at Home' u as the theme of the address given by Dr. .Vewton Fetter at Student Church this
week.,"""We are all in Fiarch of this feeling of l>eing at I'ome in our world"", he .said in the c(,ur.<<i' of his talk. This was Dr. Fetter's first home- coming and he said of it, ""I had a sense of loneliness of not being 'at Lome'."" He explained this by adding that few of his classmates were her * and that hardly anyone knew him or #'cared"". ""Ixmeliness"", .said he, ""i^ ;i part of religious experience and everyone must feel it at times. ""He citeil several incidents of how he ac- ouired the feeling of being ""at home"" in various fields of his endeavor. One of these was of his two hour struggle with an original problem in geometry. When he had mastered it, he felt ""at Lome in the field of geometry"". ' (Jetting to feel at home is a hanl process in some cases"", he said. To this he added some very amu.sintr stories of how he got this feeling during his four years at Bucknell. He spoke of his trials and tribula- tions with the sophomores when hf* tirbt entered into Bucknell. These \.ire especially appreciateii by thi freshmen who are going through haz- ing processes similar to those he men- tioned. Dr. F<<'tter. who is a member of Delta"
Sigma,"fraternity, graduated fiom Bucknell in lf>09. He took part in many campus activities, ""but just I nough to enjoy them"". Among these activities was the editorship of the Bucknellian which was at that time called the Orange and Blue. This en- tailed a great deal of work as he himself wrote everj-thing except the sports section. He suffered the criti- cism of his fraternity brothers every Monday night when the paper came out. Of this he said. ""Criticism is one of the most important things lo which we can be exposed"". He is now Baptist Student pastor in Boston where he has lived for the past 21 years."

THURSDAY.,
NOVEMBER,"7. 1940. hy Walton Cloke Another election has come and gone, and America for the first time ill her hi.story has declare<i that she can't continue without the leadership of one man. Precedents, although histt)ric and necessary, weie thrown to the winds and tlu- ""indispensable 'nan"" was elected. Not so great was his margin in the popular vote, but the electoral college proved to be a landslide for him. To us the electoral college is an outmoded custom fur a streamlined government, in fact Senator Cabot Lodge has already made the first mov>>' to amend the constitution and eliminate this body. Of course we realize that the ""indispensable man"" would still have won the election on his popular vote, but if his"

If a quarterback calls the wrong play in two consecutive games and loses both contests for his coach does the coach take a chance on losing another game with the same quarterback? He does not. He .sticks in another quarterback. Rut after eight futile years Americans still bank on a quarterback who has calle<l the wrong signals on labor, big business, foreign policies, and other items to numerous to mention. William Allen White, that famous journalist from Kan.sas, has called for the complete backing of .America's President. He wants both parties to drop their political grievances and build for the unity of .\merica. Here we whole-heartedly agree. If .Xmciica goes down we all go down, not just several Denioi-rats or .several Republicans. We"
MUST,
INITF.,"for the good of America not the good of any one party, and .Americans have enough love of country to do just that. To Americans it's .America before anything else. It always has been and it always will be. Mr. Roosevelt is not the democratic president now, he is America's president, and .America will back him to the last man. May it ever be so."

C,During the course of a year the
BUCKNELLl.A.N,"is privileged to exchange publications with the leading college newspapers in the coun- try. Sometimes feuds are stirred up among the columists and ideas an- copied, but all in all its a great custom. Lately it has been quite a task for the larger college newspapers to keep up with their local, national, and international news, what with football, the election, and the several wars over seas, demanding almost equal attention. In reading through a recent issue of the Clemson University"
TIGER,"we came acro.ss one of the best and most novel ideas for handling this situation we have ever .seen in our short journalistic career. Here it is: To Hell with-- Tulane Wendell Willkie and Adolf Hitler that should cover the local, national and international situ- ation with ease. (Your coIuini.>*t apologizes to all loya!

Under the direction of a committee headed by John Zeller, '41, the drive has for it.>< purpose the securing of funds for the development of the con. ference and outing center which has come to be used by a great number of Bucknell students. The goal of this annual campaign has been set this year at *1000, to be raised among the l,3r>0 students. So- licitors will contact students for in- dividual contributions during the \ieek; this is the only part of Buck- nell's building program to which .stu- dents are invited to contribute. .After a three year search for a Buitable site, directed by Dr. I-eo Rockwell, now head of the Depart- ment of Literature of Colgate Uni- versity, the Center was finally situ- ated at Cowan, seven miles from the campus. The original farm house was refurnished, the men's building remodeled, and many additions inside and out were made. \ total of S.'j.'iOO has been spent in purchasing and im- proving the 28-acre property. Play- ing fields, picnic groves, out -door tire- places and winter accommodations aie .Tv.-tilable for iir.e of rampus groups. Thirty different group>>>> have used the Center thus far this fall, and facilities for an many as forty rtu- donts are free to all campus groupB by clearing the .schedule at the C. A. office. Fonner classes have left over $1000 for the construction of a new Lodge with modern equipment."

Hall,"The Kappa Delta sorority held its annual pledge dance last Saturday night in I.Ari8on Hall living room. The theme of the dance was one that was entirely different than any ever pre.sented at Bucknell before. The dance was based on the idea of the little ""Watchbird"". There were posters on every wall, the idea being taken from the well known cartoons of .Munro lieaf.. Some of them that particularly caught the fancy were those concerned with class cutting, fraternity pin snatching, and laziness. Also mounted on the walls were mini- ature watchbirds bearing the names of the pledges. Ivan ^''aux supi)lied the music for the dancers, and just before inter- mission Jane Shounder, '42, introduc- ed and presented a white rose to each pledg<<>.

-MANNERS,"???? Hucknelliaiis were treated to one of the finest .Artist Courst* pr<<'.vn- tatiuns ever held at Buckiiell, wh<<Mi .Mis.-; (Jladys Swaithout, America's tirst lady of sonR, presented her recital in the Davis (Jyiniiasiuin. last Monday evening- Not being a<< tt.\p<<rt criti' on music or musical presentations, your writer is not in a imnition to comment on the nuire technical points of the recital, but the comment lioin this column is that never have we heard Ji mon- l>eaufiful, sparklinj;:, .soprano voice than Miss !^wai1liout's. Her vibrant personality, combined with her lovely voice, presented a new hiifh in Artist t'ourst* entertainment on the Bucknell campus. For .Miss Swaithout we can't find enouph orchids, but for those most incon.'^iderate little boys in the gallery, who tlioujjht they were watching a sluK-ferit during the Eas.eni IntercoUejfiate Conference Championship bout.H, and whistled like throe trains passin^r Tuxedo Junction all at one time, we have a crate of lemons. We aKso have an additional crate of citrous fruit for those thoujrht- leu, fun lovinjf collegians who applauded when the Bucknell .student asHisting the piani.st walked out on the platform to arrange the piano. Of all the childish, thoughtless, inconsiderate, dowii right disgu.sting, things to do, these two take first prize. Taking into consideration the attitude of those students on .Monday night we can do nothing but a.'^snme that they would do the same thing in the Metropolitan Opera House, and that their manners just aren't what a college students should be. They can be compared to tho.se men (we are assuming that IJucknell coeds have better manners >> who inak<<' a woman stand in a trolley car, or ait in the presence of ladies with their hats on. Rut the men weren't th<' c.nly one.> in the wrong. The young ladies who came to hear .Vliss Swaithout in saddle shoes and sweaters were definitely abusing the privilege of Httending a conceit, presented by as famous a .star as .Miss i<<warthout, dres.<ed informally, llie correct at- tire for Miss Swarthout's recital was strictly formal, but due to the cir- cumstances this was impossible. However it did nut mean come in sweaters and .saddle shoes. Some Bucknell coeds weie even wearing knee boots when they were presented to Mi.ss Swarthout, which would have been perfectly alright if it had been a .^leigh riding party. F'rom now on it would be a good idea to save the whistles, the ap- plause. ai\d the knee boots for some Saturday afternoon when the foot- ball te.im plays in the rain."

They've never doubted that. In brief, twenty-eight men .md four coaches are deeply appiTciative. Bucknell play.s her football games on the gridiron, but there's a wide territory tn cover when the time arrives to explain where th^ contests are wrm. The scoreboard tells the final storj- and the players do all they can to make 4he tale as interesting as possible -- all in one day out of seven. The other six days'.* Practice? Certainly, but there's a .Monday morning ship on the back for our right guard who is plugging away in a difficult e.ngineeiing class, or a ""Nice goin' kid"" salute to a battered halfbatk, wjiile a half-dozen tykes wearing dinks chorus a cheery ""That'.>> showin' 'em"" to a smiling, lanky end. What does all this"
mean?,"It means plenty to Coach Humphreys and his skippers-and most of all it has b>>-en an inspiration to those ""never-.sa.N -die"" ball toters and linemen. It's meant one vict^iry, two ties, and -- oops, shall we stop there? Why no. not by a long shot. Kven in those two defeats we looked impressive. It was a matter of responsibility for our boys, whf> are constantly aware of the campus spirit that has beckoned theni onward when the going seennnl roughe.st. Young men who possess this high qualitv of detorminatioii are not forgotten. Bucknellians have indicate<l this in their never-ending re- spect for the team and the coaches. '#""he spirit pervading the campus the.^e pa.^t weeks has drifted l"" the gridiron and ju.'^t as the students have mustered together for the Herd's .-ake, th<<' .same story is true on the greenswards wherever the Bisons have trampled this campaign. .Vol eleven men -- you're far off the track, brother-- but each individual footballer on the 2H-man .S(iuad has a habit, of keeping on trying to a cnmplish whatever he sets out to do.

THE,
NATIONAL,
SCENE,"by Peter Tras Two .Second F<dltorial: .Armistice Day came and wnt and was observed with little of the her- aldry it knew in the early '20's. It came to a world once more being tern to pieces by man-made methods with Nature adding her bit in a Ru- manian earthquake in which thou- sands perished. Countries at peace were being overrun with saboteurs sent by belligerent nations, especial- ly here in the United States where all tlie recent explosicms can not be put down as ""accidental"". Kverywhere there were fervent |)rayers for peace, lut the .Spirit of the Annistice could only look sadly over the ruin and desolation and weep f<ir those who had died suppo.sedly to prevent a repetition of mass murder of n>14-l>*, Wendell 1.. Willkie added his voice to the general cry for national unity and the discarding of campaign en- mity. He urge<i his supporters to cling to their principles and to con- tinue to ait as a constructive minor- ity. The Federal Bureau ""f Investiga- tion is on the job checking cm the explosions which have systematically been touched off"
by,"something or someone. Fifteen persons were kill- e<I in three explosions alone and maniy others injured. .Sabotage? That's what the Justice Department tntendji to find out.

It was thought that in the twentieth century, all problems were solved. , The life of the speaker seemed to be , entirely maj)ped out for him because he was boni into the aristocracy , which had retained most of its tradi- tions from the middle ages. However, the first break in this established order came when the Btarvinff lower classes began to revolt ^ in 1912. Two years later, with the"
I,"cominR of the World War, this social system collapsed completely as the aristocracy was placed in the same | position as the lower classes of ^ people. Germany was then a weak and poor"
nation.,] \chievements ForKotten Two alternatives remained for the
|,"German people following the war. They could l)ecomo Nazis and break th<<' Versailles Treaty by force, or be- come a democracy and rebuild Ger many by chanjfing the treaty throuRh negotiatirm."
Germany,"chose the former. ""Great things were achieved under German democracy, but thev are forgotten today"", said the exiled leader. ""The Versailles treaty was revised by negotiation under German democracy long before Hitler came into power. If Hitler had not come into power,"
Germany,"would today have achieved all tho.-se thitirs legiti- n'atcly which today she is achieving by force."" The IVince in Ht2i>> predicted in his rollege thesis, that if Fascism, which then existed only in Italy, should eve- come to Germany, there would be an- other war. Since then, he has fought for democracy. He became leader of a large group of re))ublican youth and the Catholii Youth .Movement in Gennany. World CriHls Blow to German*. Continued the speaker, ""The worst blow to German democracy was the world crisis in 192i> with the ri.se of radicals in"
Germany.,"GeiTnan de- mocracy was not overthrown by the German people, becau.xe they were (satisfied with its achievements. It was overthrown from above when the German president unconstitutionally handed over power to Hitler. The \azis never had a majority in Ger- niany."" Von I.rf)ewen8tein remained in Ger- j many as long as possible after the ( rise of the Nazis. Since that time,"
I,he has warned other world democra- cies of the danger that was coming
j,"when he predicted the coming war. Our greatest problem today is to establish a constructive peace pro- gram which will guarantee freedom and establish an international order for negotiation. Following the war, either a com-"
j,"monwealth of nations will be estab- lisheii in Kurope, or a short armistice i with anarchy or a Russian communist victory will be establi.<<hed. The pres- ent danger of Russia"
was,brought ' about by Hitler in achieving his ends.

Address,"For tile second time in the history of its publication, ""The Bncknellian"" received tw() of the four cups that art>> awarded semi-annually by the In- tercollegiate' News Association, for excellence in college journalism, at that organization's fall convention, held at Franklin and Marshall Col- lege last weekend. The first time ""The Bucknellian"" received fuch an honor was eleven years ago. Out of the twenty cjimpus news organs, representatives of college.^ and universities in Pennsylvania, New York, and"
New,".Jersey, Bucknell's weekly publication was chosen by the judges as being mo.<<tt outstanding in general news coverage, make-up, and treatment and di.<<play of local ad- vertising. In addition to winning cups for news and advertising, ""The Bucknell- ian"" sports section took a substantial second in its division, drawing the following comment from ""Red"" Smith, one of the 1."
N.,
A.,"judges, and a nationally known sports reporter on the staff of the Philadelphia Record, ""The Hucknellian has one of the most professional looking sports pages"
I,"have ever seen. The material is well covered and interesting."" Mr. Perry"
B.,"Ruhe. editor of the Allentown .Morning Call, in giving his decision on the awarding of the news cup to Hucknell, made the following comment, ""The Bucknellian has the best make-up and treatment of head- lines and news tlmt I have ever seen In a college newspaper."""
A,"member of the staff of the Phila- delphia Inquirer praised the advertis- ing composition and make-up in The Fucknellian. drawing attention to the fact that local ad%-ertising is made appealing as well as informative. F'our members of the staff of The Bucknellian si)ent la.st weekend on the Franklin and .Marshall campus, at- tending the International News .As- Rociation Convention. Walton Cloke, managing editor; James Hind, busi- ness manager; Jean Rmkwell. society editor, and Jean Shake, assistant managing editor, repre.sented I'.uck- nell University.

Inez Robiaon, con- tralto, and Charles Stickney, violinist, will be the soloists, and William Mc- Rae will assi.st at the organ. The program will also include a Chinese Folk song, which will be Sling by Ix)is .#Xnne Kiggins.

A,"(juartette composed of Maigeri- da Reno. Inez Robison. Lois .Anne Kiggins and Lulu Stolz will sing some of the works of well known compos- ers such as Bortiansky.

A,"silver offering will be taken. The ftudents and public arc cordially in- vited to attend. ""The Wiirld is taking"
a,"definite trend towanl finer hooks"", Mr.>. George Kmerson Barnes state<i in her address at Student Church, Sundav night. .She has, within the past few years, developed"
a,"wide reputation for her interpretations of books. Before the world war our hooks were ultra-proper. Profanity ami open, frank discussions of sex were unheard-of infringements of the laws of good taste. Immediately follow- ing the war, veterans, sick of the smugness of .American society, be- came determine<l to up.<<!et it. As a result, all the undesirables of th"" past were brought into our literature and consequently our conversation, to ;>n extreme. Now. since, as Mrs. Barnes put it, ""We realize that we cannot escape this war we have been hoping to pre- vent"", the writers of today have be- come more .serious, considering the problems of the world with intelli- gence. Books have reached the Gol- den Mean between stuffiness and com- mon trash. Biographies, which used to be all ""debunking"" or all praise, are now- true stories giving the defeats n^ well as the successes of their .sub- jects."" Mrs. Barne-; feels that the state- ment is again true that ""a fine book comes to live with you"". She says that she is richer for knowing some of the characters in recent book.'. And, as she expresse<l it, ""The seri- ous things go down"

Second,
Semester,"In a meeting held last Wednesday evening in Taylor Hall, the ""B"" club adopted many plans which will make this honorary dub, for varsity men, a more active organization on the campus. Plans were set forth to handle the intramural boxing bouts and to ar- range for special events to take place the night of the finals, Friday, De- cember 13. Ralph Ijvengood. presi- dent of the ""B"" club, received many .suggestions from the members pres- ent. .A variety of events was decided upon and a special committee was ap- pointed to carry out the program for that evening. Livengood says that, in collaboration with President Marts, he has taken steps to contact a notable in boxing circles, who, it is hoped, will act as honorary referee dijring the evening. .Additional business for the evening included plans for a dance and a var- sity show. The dance will be held r'ther January 10 or 17. Arrange- ments are now being made for the orchestra for that evening and the admission price will be decided upon at the next business meeting. Plans for the varsity show are well under way and at the next meeting the director for the .show will b<<>> chosen and a tentative date will be set. In all probability, it will take place during the mi<ldle of the second s. mester, sometime in late March or early .April. The program for that evening is to include motion pictures of some of this year's football games, in additi<m to the usual all-male ciiorus and comical skits. President Marts has already ex- pressed his hope that the plans for this show will materialize and that the varsity .show will become a tradi- tion at Bucknell."

Dean Page and .Adviser Paul Hightower have offered their full cooperation in Veepinif'rthe fraternities posted con- cerning t^e progress of their pledges. The Intrafratemity Council has f..i-med a social committee to arrange for exchange dinners between the Cieek letter houses. Several have 'ali-eady tried the plan under their own initiative and found it very .satis- factory. The evenings of the dinners will provide an opportunity for everyone lo become better ac(iuainted and to observe what the other houses are fioing inside their doors."

COIILLION,",,-. ""Name Hand"" seems to be a magic phrase in colleRiate lanKuajj*' today and for a university student body it is u must that stamps all bands bearing the title as the aristocrats nf jam and jive. This all lead.-; up to the fact that the sophomore class of Biicknell has selected DicJc Stabile, the ma.ster of the .laxaphone, to supply the rylhms at their an- nual ""Cotillion"" to be held in the Davis (iymnasium ..n December f, As per usual there will be some groans over the selection and there will be cheers, but to us it seems that the sophomore cla.ss has made a good selection under the circum.stances. It must be remembered that this is one class dance that does not have the financial support that the other two class dances have. Taking the financial .status into consider- ation it can be easily seen that it is impossible for the S<>>phomore Cotil- lion to present .<<uch bands as Glenn .Miller or Bob Chester. Dick Stabile is not a newcomer to the Bucknell"
campus.,"He .saw Hucknell's three hundred acres when some of the present crop of stu- dents hardly knew what a < ollepe was. In 19:ts. coming direct from the Hotel William Penn in Pittsburgh. Dick Stabile played for Biicknell's Junior Prom and the tax was .'54.00 per couple. Incidentally this dance wae the social suc(ess of the 1938 .social season and nette<l a profit of $lfiO.OO. with an advanced .sale of over $1,000.00. This year Bucknell is havinK him for the Sophomore Cotillion and the tax per couple is only $2.75 if the ticket is purchased before Decem- ber 5. .After December fi all tickets will sell for $3.00 per couple. Com- paring the figures, this present crop of Bucknellians are really getting a break. Stabile's band will fpatur*- the sinjfing of lovely Shirley Gaye. the sweetheart of Bong. Bill DeMa.vo, the romantic baritone, the five musical woodwinds, and the Stabile .<<aNtettr, which has been acclaimed the best *sax section in the land. All in all, it Hhould be one of the best Sopho- more Cotillions in many year?. --"

Its a boost like this that keeps a newspaper staff plugging along. It .""cem.'' to tis that the slaps on the back from the students are really few and far between, but th<<; gripes and complaints are numerous. Not that all we are working for is to be coinj)limented on everything we do, not at all, complaints are neressary, but a word of encouragement goes a long way. The year isn't half over and vv<< have had more than our share of complaints."
A,"select group <>>f .seniors met recently and discussed the Bucknellian and how badly it was being run this year. It seems that some of our methods didn't suit them. We even received word that one of the professors on the campu.'* said that the Hucknellian was nothing to brag about. We have seen students take the Bucknellian out of their mail boxes and throw it in the nearest wastebasket without even glanc- ing at it. Veji, we took all this in our stride and said nothing, for we knew we were doing th<<' liest we could."

This will be Stabile's second ap- I'carance on the Bucknell campus, as lie played here for the annual Junior Prom in 10.37. which was considered the highlight of the .social season of that year, .""^^ince that time he has changed the make-up of his band slightly and has added Shirley Gaye. the sweetheart of .song, to his already famous group of musicians. Dick and the boys have  been a tre- mendous success where ever they have p'aye<l. .Such famous .supper club,""? and hotels as the Statler Hotel in Cleveland. Edgewater Beach Hotel in Chicago. Essex House in N'ew York, the Flitch Gardens in Denver, and the Hotel Syracuse in J^yracuse have ac- claimed! .Stabile and hi.-; band as one ot the finest in the country. Stabile was formerly concert mas- ter with Ren Hemie and his orche.s- tra, organizing his own band several years ago. In the short time be- tween his as.sociations with Bemie and the preessnt. Dick has definitely lesstablished himself as one of the (""name"" bands of the conntry. through his fine arrangements and unexcelled Isaxaphone playing. ^ In analyzing the Stabile presenta- tion  manner, it may readily be seen vhy and how he and his organization have skyrocketed to fame in an amaz- ingly short period of time. As Dick himself tells it, ""An ideal orchestra is one which .should embody two main requisites. In the fii-st place, it must l^ave original arrangements which, vhile possessing a complexity in tech- nique, still retains a staple colorfull- ness and harmony, and in the second place, the orchestra must have mu.si- cians who are gifted with individual brilliance and yet are able to offer this same brilliance when combined in n unit.""

I,have ju8t read the Hucknellian ;.i.d hasten to send my congratula- tions to you and your Staff for the rrcent honor conferred upon you. It reflects cre<<lit upon all of you and Rucknell may well be proud of your success.
I,am glad to sec that you keep your sen.se of huninr functioning. This should help take the sting out ('f complaints. Pon't let it worry I you but remember that there are al- ;ways people whose halos either don't i fit or are too tight. Personally I would like to see the ToIIegre add three new departments:
A,Chair of Humor.
1,.A Chair of Incisure.
A,"Chair of Imagination. A Chair of Humor might prevent 'one from taking oneself tr)o seriously. A Chair of I>>i.sure might prevent hardening of the arteries. A Chair of Imagination could be I combined with Fine Arts and together .with ilaubing and .scribbling one could conceive a lighter touch a mon' tol- iorant attitude towaid everyone and 'everything. So often people are |!S!iubbed when they are alive and i loudly praised after they are dead. ' This is too bad, isn't it? But what can one expect when    often the med- jium in which some people exchange ideas is the weather. .Anyway - my i-ongratulatiims and keep up the good work."

For,
Cotillion,"by Ralph Bullun Based on sweet music with just enough .swing, Dick Stabile and his orchestra helped provide an enjoyable evening for everyone at the Sopho- n^ore Cotillion last Friday evening. The weather did not have any no- ticeable effect on the attendance. With an advanced ticket sale greater than for any preivous Cotillion, the <<^'ening progressed in a most sociable atmosphere. Playing with a handicap of two taped ribs, suffered in an auto acci- <lent. Dick led the orchestra in a man- ner so pleasant that any disability vas unnoticeable. He hits the high- est note in the world on the saxa- phone, and he displayed this skill ex- cellently. With five other saxaphones tlie combined effect was very unique. Bill Staffin does most of the arrang- ing for the band with the help of Dick and several other members. Something out of the ordinary was provided when Stabile le<l a congo. Without hesitancy he had the group doing the congo almost before they knew it themselves. Mary Osborne, the new addition to the band, played the guitar in a manner to please the most critical. Several specialty num- bers with Dick and Mary accompanied by the band received enthusiastic ac- claim. Shirley Gaye and Bill De Mayo took care of the vocals for the evening. The band's next stop is New York. From there they head for the Gibson Hotel in Cincinnati where they will play from the 20th of this month up to and including New Year's Eve. # ^ I Dt>> Your"

TWO,MtiHTS
AT,
THE,
FIGHTS,"(*^.\ny aimiiarity to perHons living or dead im purely coincidental -- ) Ever>' year, in every way, they get better and better. I mean the intramural boxing bouts. Not only do the fighters seem to improve, but the audience itself offers a real show that i.s mi8.sed by .s<jme in their overt 7.e&\ to see the fights. Besides watching the fights for the past two nights and throwing a few rights and lefts from the press table, we kej)t a watchful eye on the audience just to .see how these fistic combats emotionally arou.><<e John J. Public. Well, we found out. At 7:15 the fraternity men arrive to gi'ab off the be-st seats in the house, and have a little bull session over the fact that their man in the 135-lb. class should knock the tar out of the rival fraternity man. Be- sides their man fought in several amateur bouts and won them all. No need to let the opposition know that though, let's tear him to ribbons and throw him to the dogs. l^ater the coeds charge through the doors and scramble for seats as near to the .scene of the murder as they ean find. Because believe it or not they're a blood thirsty lot. They like to see a bruising battle, and .some of them, make no pretense at concealing their delight. The referee and the judges finally come in and the crowd cheers its head off for the first time, just to tune up their vocal chords. The judges are introduced and one in particular, he's a handsome guy, gets more ap- plause than the others. He'.s embarassed, anii the crowd is happy be- cause their infinence has been felt. Then up from the locker roimi smelling of every kind o liniment on the market, and with too much va.seline smeared on their faces, come the warriors of fisticuff. Big ones, little ones, tall ones, .short ones, fat ones, skinny ones, and some just fighters. Banium would have been jiroud to display the lot of them. They take their places trying to show a great deal of complacency, and either falling over the water bucket or having their gloves put on before they take their robes off, which is impossible. .Ask .Maxie Baer if you don't believe it. Then they're in the ring, and the referee is giving them instructions along with twenty of their fraternity brothers in the front row. .After the instructions the two jiugilists .scami)er to neutral ,.oineis to rosin up. Here experience will always rear its ugly head. The man in the know- rosins his number lO's with a fancy shuffle rythm, while the novice just stirs up a cloud of dust. Then back t<i their corners where their .seconds are just full of kindwords and advice. Thi' belli Hoth men are off the stools like a couple of snails, or if the one man is bigger than the other he comes out like the Black Dia- nmnd Express. They meet in the middle of the linj,'. and the show is on. One man is a fancy pants, he saw too many movies, and docs he look it. He begs the other man to ""come on and fight"". He looks at his seconds and shrugs his shoulders and two minutes later the guy he was begging to fight bats him into oblivion. The crowd sighs and waits until the handlers carry the n'mains from the riiiK. The next fight is between two bruisers, good looking guys, and the coeds all take a new Iea.se on life. They are hanging on the edge of their seats and when the announcer calls the handsome boys name they go slap happy with applau.se. The boys are in the comer, and the hand- lers take two minutes of good fight out of the boxer by slapping a sponge in his face, pounding his arms and legs, and yanking the stool out from under him when the bell rings, so that he finds hinuself hanging on the rupes before he throws a punch. He comes off the ropes like a rocket, and his arms putting Don Quixote's windmill to .shame, he slashes at his opponent and after two buuising lounds puts across the final touch needed to have his opponent carried out r)f the ring feet first. The coeds go wild, as do some thirty brothers and as the con(|ueroring hero clasps his gloved hands above his head he falls flat on his face and leaves the ring by the feet first exit. Then by .some chance, miracle, or fate two real boxers get into the ring, and this did happen on Tue.s.sday night. Their handlers don't have to work over them, they know how they were going to fight their fight. Ihey come to the center of the ring and spar and exchange several snappy blows that were real point getters. No resptmse from the crowd. They spar and box beautifully. When they hit they really hit. They have rythm and coordination. .\d response from the crowd. The last round finds both boy.s still boxing .smoothly, there has be<>n no knock- downs, no slugfests, no wild swinKirig, and the one man wins tm a clean cut deci.sion. The crowd shows mild response, out of shear courtesy, not reali/ing they have seen the best the intramurals will i.ffer them this year. This little story could go on for several C(dumns, just pointing out little things that happen when Hucknell Roes to the fights, but this is as goo<l a i)lace to end as"
any.,"The next time you go to the fights look around you, there's human interest galore."

Decades,".As the years roll past, there are many who have given a large portion of their life to the .service of Buck- i.ell. For the la.st 21 years ThomAs <:iay has given his services to th<< I'niversity by his work in the kitchen of the Women's College. Everyone who has dined or worked in the Sem- inary knows old Tom. Life at Bucknell has passed in a steady panorama before his eye<<, leaving him many plea.sant memories of the past. The many friends that he has made while working here, re- member him at Christmas time. Some send"
him,"little Rifts while others send RO'xl wishes for the year. Well does Tom remember the old nil lamps on the fire-escapes; the rickety old wa.shinp machine that had to be worked by hand; and the time the girls who were waiting on the tables had to stumble down into the cellar to get the home-made ice cream to serve. In contrast, Tom now oper- ates the last word in washers. He handles an average r.f 10,(K>O pieces of table equipment a"
day.,"This is eviough to keep any man busy. Before eoming to Bucknell, Tom worked as a cook in Norfolk, Atlantic City, and Philadelphia. He was also head bell boy in one of the leading seashore hotels. One of the outstand- ing exiM'riences of his life, was the t;me that he shipped out of Phila- delphia as thin! mate on"
a,"large ocean Roing barge. This trip took him to Norfolk by way of the Chesa peake and Delaware Canal, down the Chesapeake Bay, with a stop over at Baltimore. The last job he had be- fore coming to I-ewisburR was in an oyster packing house on the Eastern .^hore of Virginia. ; Only colleges in the country ante- jdaling the Iniversity of Pennsylvania 'are the College of William and Mary, 'Har\aid and Vale Universities. * ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^V^^^^^^^^^^^N^^^^^* '"

*******,"Bucknell has always had some kind of a student government, more i.r less selected bv fratemitv politics and popularity. It has been largely of a punit'ive nature, and not fundamentally cooperative wnth administrative authoritv. The need for a better system arose during the post-war pericxi when many students entered Bucknell not so much from a cultural background as from newly-rich familie.s-- students with more monev than brains, and hell-rai.sers in particular. They laile<l to get their money's worth, they drove a hard bargain. I rofes- .sor Burpee was pushed ""hard to keep window panes, door panels, and hinges in their accustome<l places. In the early thirties, the proctor system was officially installed. Proctors were largely dormitory cops, and while few in number, they had the .Administration back of them. In the year 19M, Dr. Robert Sutherland, on recent Uean of Men originated a new psychological approach to thf problems of dormitory"
life.,"*,**.. u * ""Bob"" Sutherland, and we use this name not with familiarity but with treasured affection, gave us the counselling system these few vears back, and it has proved so successful that"
many,"prominent .schools have made inquiries about it. and have sent some of their lead- ing officials to observe it in operation. One of the fine.st results al- ready achieved is the marked improvement in the scholastci standings, of tlie freshman classes in particular. The academic mortality ot ireshmen has decreased api'ioximately two-thirds in this short time. Who are the coun.selors. and how art- they chosen? hirst of all. thev are men of superif)r scholarship, and nearly all are on the Dean s"
J,"list' of high-ranking ability. They range from juniors to graduate 5 students and voung professors. Each floor of all dormitories has a counselor, and all the students on that floor are at liberty to approach him with anv problem which they might have on their minds. They are each. jus""t one of the boys with a little more experience, who live and move and have their being in dormitory traditions. They have the authoritv of the Administration behind them, but like good officers ever\'where."" they gain their objective."" by reasoning, good exam)>le. and diplomacy. Seldom does a case of discipline re.|uire the attention of a ""higher court"". Receiving regular reports of the grade.-, of all the ^tudenUs. they have a ooncrete problem in raising these grades wherever necessary. They show the student how to budget his time and how to study. ' In many in.<<tances. they help them direct y in their studies, or make arrangements with tutors to help individual student.s The counselors are in their rooms every night from after dinner ujitil >>fter midnight.

Althouffh an Enpli.shnian by birth, Bauer has definitely establi.she<i hini- FClf in the pattern of .-Vmerican musi,"" through his out.-<tandinp ability at the keyboard and through written music that has been acclaimed the world over. His unfailinfr interest in orchestras, chambci music, inusic *wieties, musical schools and col- legre.s, and his untirinp efforts to as- MBt them by counsel and to encour- age them by personal appearances, have won him jfreat popularity. Mr. Bauer made his appearance in American music in 1901 when, as a soloist, he played with the Boston Sjnnphony Orchesti-a. Since then he has played with every orchestra of r.ote in this country and Europe, and his name alone is sufficient to conjure to the minds of thou.sands of music- lovers throughout the lenffth and breadth of the land, memories of his imforjrettable art. As founder and continous piesideiit of the Beethoven Assoiiation of N'ew York, an orjrani/.ation which he form- ed in IWIK, he has niven generously of his .services in helping to further the appreciation of musical art and the fellowship of musicians in this country. His ai>>pearance at [iucknell will give the music lovers of this area the opportunity to see and hear ojie of the preat pianists in the music world todav."

RADIO,Nt. longer will the radio audience of

No longer will the song of the United States Naval Academy, ""Anchors Aweigh"". or the song of the fighting men of Army, ""On Brave Old Army Team"" be broadcast over the three leaiiing networks in the United StateH. Why'? Well it seems like a mystery to us to, but as far as we aiv able to determine now it is true. The American Society of Conipo.sers, Authors, and Publishers, the organization under which most of America's great college song>>> are published, and who lists under its membership Thointon"
W.,"Allen, publisher of most of America's outstanding college songs, is being boycotted by this country's three leading radio networks. The reason lor the boycott, according to a press release that reached your writer's desk this week, is to give a company called Broadcast Music Inc., which is backed by the three large radio corporations, complete con- trol of all music u.sed on the air. So it seems that the mogols of big broadcasting are letting them- selves open for the biggest lam-basting they have had in their collec tively short .span of existence. No longer will ""On Wisconsin"", ""The Washington and l-ee Swing"", ""Fordham Ram"", ""Maine Stein Song',, ""hMght On Pennsylvania"", ""Hail To Pitt"". ""Notre Dame Victory March"". '*Colgate Invictus"", and more than a 1000 other  college songs l>e heard over the airwaves. The"
BLACKOUT,
OF,
COLLEGE,"Mi:>>SlC is scheduled to start un January 1 of 1941. Will the American colleges, if such a thing happens and to all indications it will, stand by and see their victory songs, their alma maters, songs that to them rank just below their national anthem, swpet from the aiil^nes by big corporations .seeking control in music. Or will they fight? It is my opinion that they will fight, and if they do, it will be a battle that I for one won't want to miss. L(mg before America listened to radios she listened to the alma maters and victory songs of the colleges and universities that educated her children, and without a doubt she will continue to demand to listen to"
them.,If radio refuses to bring this music int<i the American home the pressure is sure to be applie<l before long. Can American radio com- panies ignore college
music?,"It is our guess that they can't, because the people want it and it is the people who support radio. This ban on music that is published under the"
ASCP,"wont effect col- lege music only, it will take from the airwaves such famous .songs as lr\ing Berlin's ""God Bless .America"". Perhaps Bucknell students, who have a definite interest in ""Bucknell's Berlin"" would have something to say about this. Others that will feel the axe are ""Indian I.ove Call"". ""Sylvia"", ""Only For Ever"", ""St. l>>uis Blues"". ""Old Man River"", and that favorite of all favorites ""Sweet Adeline"". All of these are America's favorites, some of them older than radio itself. Will the dawn of the new y<<ir find them and America's college .songs on the shelf for good, or will college irtudents and lovers of America's popular music .stage a battle for their favorit<<.s and return them to their deserved status on the radio?

SECOND,"by (buck KIdridge & Bill Hulley Kight new intramural boxing cflam- pions were crowned in Bucknell'a most popular Greek sport last Friday night in Davis Gymnasium before a capacity crowd of fren/ied .students and local fight fans. From the open- ing event, a three round exhibition bout between Coach Joe Reno and Cjr Trecartin. to the final heavyweigrht battle, the fight fans were treated ta two and a half action-packed hours ""'# slugging, the like of which can't be duplicated anywhere at any price. The Phi Gams proved to be the (lark horse entrant, as their original team of four men battled their way to the finals and garnered enough points to eke out a slim marjjin over their favored opponents and take the handsome bronze trophy. Only one of the F'ijis emerged a tliamp, but the other three piled up enough T-unner-up points to gain a one-point advantage over the Sig>> and a two point lead over the threat- ening Kappa Sigs. The winning team was not decided until after the final match, for if Nagel had beaten Reichert, the Kap- pa Sigs and Phi Gams would hav*>> been tied at fourteen point.s apiece'- An it was, this year's bouts produced the closest competition the sport has 'lad in the last six years.

D.,"S., is tieasurer. F'very time a team bowls then- is .: charge of fifty cents per team, and, due to this extra charge- which is bonie by the play<<'rs, it is the desire of the offici;i-s to have this independ- ent league continue until the addi- tions have been niaile to the gymnas- ium where bowling alleys will be available."
A,"i>eautiful cup, donate<l by Mr. Stover, will be awarde<i to the win- ning team. Other prizes will be given to the high scoring individual for the season and for the season's highest indi%-idual score. The.sc indi- vidual prizes will be in the form of cash awards and will accumulate from the donations of each individual who voluntarily gives five cents each night that he bowls. The"

Goodman,will play for the Bucknell Junior Prom which will be held in the Davi.^ Gymnasium on February 28. Sur- prised are
you?,"I don't mean at the fact that Goodman will l)lay for the Prom, as you have probably h<<anl that already. But are you surprised that Bucknell Juniors picked and finally got the band that rated top swing honors for the past several yeai-s in most of the popu- larity polls. Oh! You heard that Muhlen- berg College has signed Tommy Dorsey for  the 21st of February and you would rather have him. In fact you just can't .see why we don't have him at Bucknell. Well there is a rather large and intricate story behind that. College Student. We won't tax your mind with a heavy subject like that just before << xams, but we will tell you this, that your. Prom committee selected the band that they thought would satisfy you at a time that the col- lege calendar said you would like to be satisfied. It .seems that when Mr. T. Dorsey was contacte<l before he had signed enough theater contracts to paper the lounge in Roberts Hall. Fl<<'n(<<' Bucknell's Junioi* Prom com- mittee was not able to sign the Sentimental Gentleman on the dotted line."
A,"few weeks later fickle fate tells Mr. Dorsey that he might be able to do better on one night stands at h^astem colleges, so being a busine.ss man as well as a trombone ))layer he changes his course and decides to play the Easteni colleges. Result Bucknell had signed Mr. (Joodman. wh()se new band is really tops, and .Muhlenberg, who was certainly hang- ing on the brink of di.saster by waiting so long to sign a band for a dance on the 21sl of February, fell heir to a T. Dorsey contract. 1 can't make it any clearer than that. The Junior Prom committee has a problem on its hands right now. No. it's not .selling the Goodman band to the students; there is a great deal of enthusiasm among the real dance fans at Bucknell over the pros- pect of dancing t<> the swing king's band. The big problem is whether or not the Junior Prom should have a program. You know, one of tho.se things you have hanging on the wall, and I don't mean Petty drawings or a picture of Robert Taylor. I mean something like that little white program just above that picture. The one that has the autographs of (Jlenn Miller, .Marion Hutton, and Ray Kberly written acro.>*s its pages in heavy pencil. If the Pro?n i.s to have the added attraction of a program it will cost you dance goers the small sum of twenty-five cents, or a grand total of H'i.'ii} per couple. If you do not want the programs the tax will l>e $4.."")0. So what do you .say Hucknell? Do you want programs or don't you want programs? Let the members of the Junior Prom coininittec. Professor Stillman or myself know how you feel about the matter. The fate of the Prom's added attraction is now in your hands. ""'If all we hear is a good h)U<i silence the F'roni will not have jirograms. so start talking. The new policy that was adopted for the .Sophomore Cotillion will be in operation in connection with the sale of tickets for the Prom. All tickets sold at the door will be $,5.00 per couple as will all tickets pur- chased after February 2>>>. This arrangement is being carried out to give the sponsor?) of the Prom a feeling of security Ix-fore the night of the 2<<th. If you have ever had to pay a band from one to two thou.sand dollars and found that on the eve of the dance you only had six hundred, you will know what 1 mean when I .say ""sense of security"". We'll tell you more about the Prom later, but let us hear your decis- ion on the i)r(>>grams at once. 0,,"

Is it that he just wants to see if his band can handle that soil of thin(f, and get an egotistical thrill out of it. or does he really think people like it?"

DAYS,"Of troubling war bulletins, of Natioii.-il Defense anxieties, and the more immediate worry of en- croaching examinations, it  is wise to take out an hour's breathinir space. At 7:30, Monday night, .lan- uary 20th. in Hunt Hall living room. Dr."
C.,Willard Smith will read poetry for an hour or more. The meeting will be a very in- formal one. Drop in and stay as long as you
can.,You niay slip away quietly if you must. There will be firelight and can- dlelight and an hour with the great poets. It wrill be a worth while experience.
The,"Bucknell University .Men'.-? Glee Club will strike a highlight of the musical season at Bucknell when they make their annual mid-seme.ster t(.ur the week after next. Eighteen concerts and two broadcasts make up the major part of the well-filled pro- gram.

J., where they will give a concert at 8:30 and spend the night under the auspices of the Girl Scouts of that town. \ Tuesday the first concert will be I held in Lower Camden County Re- igional High School at 9:40. Lunch Uiid a concert at 12:00 noon at Peddie iv.ll be followed by the trip north to ' Cranford, X. J., where the Lion's Club 'will provide dinner.

Y.,
M.,
C.,
A.,"who will i:lso put the boys up for that night. Saturday morning at 0:30, the Glee Chib will leave for I.ewisburg, hav- ing lunch enroute. In most of the concerts, the new oiiartette consisting of Philip Roy, first tenor; James Ingraham, second tenor; Karle Thomas, baritone; and Kenneth Strittmaiter, ba.<<,s, will be"
featured.,", Cotitrary to rumor, the recent con- flict between the major radio stations and"
.ASC.AP,"will not prevent the col- I'ge songs on the Glee Club repertoire from being broadcast. Most of them have been written by Bucknell stu- d<:nt.s and arranged by Professor Mel- vin LeMon, who has given the club permission to sing"
them.,"Some of the other songs on the program may, however, be in the"
ASCAP,library and will neces.-^arily Iv- omitted from the broadcasts. The repertoire this year consists of ail
new,"numbers v\th the exivption of the ""Cherubic Hymn"" by Bortniansky which was sung in 193f). and the Bucknell song<< ""Hail! All Hail: Bucknell"" has also been added to the repertoire, arrang- ed especially for the club by Profes- ror Harold Cook."

""Love Thy Neighbor."" In addition to being complete and ultra nuMiem in every detail of its furnishings and equipment, tht Cam- pus has the <li.stinction of being the first theatre, excluding the news-reel houses, to administer the tumstiU' system of admittance. By this sys- tem, the customer pays his admis- .>-ion price at the booth and then pa.s.ses through an automatic turn- stile, which in turn, breaks the beam of an electric eye. and opens the door to the theatre proper. The seven hundred and fifty chairs which the new theatre has ;ire the latest in seating equipment. They are of comfortable leather with .soft \ civet backs and have automatic hinges which force the seats back up when net in use, thereby doing away v. ith the trouble of doing it by hand, .md eliminating the pet aversion oT H'any theatre-goers who bruise their legs on vacant seat"" when leaving their places. For elderly people who have trouble with their hearing, the marafTf*n'rr.t of the Campus has |)urchased four- teen .sets of ear phones. No addi- tional charge will be asked for the use of these sets. Soft and soothing fluorescent light- irg is employed with"
a,"five-color s,'hcme have been placed. The ceil- ing lights can be either oranire or blue, or a combination of both. Bucknell .scenes are depicted in the murals in both the men's and the women's lounges."
A,"football scene is portrayed in the men's lounge, vhile a beautiful representation of ""Old Main"" catches the eye in the vomen's lounge. Flatteringly illum- inated full-length mirrors and leather chairs with a chromium finish make the rooms most attractive. The Campus is completely air con- ditioned for both summer and winter and boasts a system which insures * complete air change every four min- utes. The admission prices on opening night will be the same as the stan- dard prices which will prevail, ten and twenty-five cents in the after- roon, and fifteen and thirty-five cents in the evening (plus tax). The man- agement, which is also in charge of the Roxj-, has disclosed that class ""B"" pictures will be .shown at the Roxy in the future at the lower prices of ten and twenty-five cents, and that r.iatinees there will be discontinued."

T.,"Purdy composed the tune to com- pete for a $1,000 prize offered by the I'niversity of Minnesota for a new football .song. When Carl Beck of New York, a friend of Pardy, heard it, he wrote the words and persuaded Purdy to give it to the University ot Wiscon.sin instead. Played for the first time on the e>>v(c) of the Wisconsin-Minnesota game in 11>>09, ""On Wisconsin"" was an immedi- ate hit. Since then it has been adapt- ed, with changes of words, by numer- ous colleges through the"
U.,"S. When Purdy died in poverty in I91H, Wisconsin alumni and friends gave $2,500 to his family. I^ater the state provided scholarships at tha University for the composer's two children.

Vi.sits and telephone calls are made several times weekly, daily, and even twice daily to local and county mortician.s, county court sessions and offices, pub- state and local police, federal and lie agricultural services, etc., to fa- cilitate complete coverage of the area news front.

Three alumni of the Colorado School of Mines presented the insti- tution with 180 meteorites ranging from pure nickel-iron alloys to all sorts of stony structures. Although other colleges have me- teorites in museums, school officials here say this is the first time stu- dents in classrooms are able to study stones in connection with weather frrecasting, aeronautics and ballistics."

The idea was conceived last year. \.hen it was felt that since French students were unable to go abroad because of the war, the need for some focal point of French interest on the campus was greater than ever be- fore. The house serves as a meeting point for the French club and all French-speaking persons among the faculty and students, both men and women, on the campus.

Forum,"by Dick Zott *'.'Student groups an- definitely in- terested in Federal Union"", said Mr, Jerry Klein, National Collegiate Di- rector of the FiKieral I'nion organi- zation on Monday evening, when he ^scussed with the county F'ederal I'nion chapter at President Marts' bouse plans for the procedure of a student intercollegiate conference- to be held on the Bucknell campus this April 2r> and 2>>j. i, Mr. Klein spoke on two subjects: iJ) what is being done by the Union In college*; and (2) what is being done in preparation for the intercol- legiate conference. In two months the number of .Stu- dent Chapter*, has incivased from 40 to nearly 200, Mr. Klein pointed 6nt, and the number of .Student represen- tatlres from 200 to over 2000. The reason for this spontaneous response to the Student movement, according to Mr. Klein, is that the students aim to establish a better world order and thus kEUR!ep democracy secure for their children. The purpo.>4e of the proposed co>>v *ventlon is to provide an authoHta- it;ve answer to a number of (juestions ; which Student Federalists have been ii<<king. On the first day of the coti- v>> ntioii suggested topics will be dis- (iisHcd by prominent men and women I interested in the Unionist movement. Tlie second day will be well-filled by jB student round-table discussion in I the morning and an ppen foru.-.i in I tile afternoon. # Students from all colleges having .""Union Now"" units are invited to at- :,*<<tid, and a large representation is ie<peot*d. -An effort will be made by ! infl' iiHtiotWl office, w hich is promot- |ii>>g the .affair, to secure Dorothy I Thompson or Claire Booth as a speak- et , or, possibly both.

ART,
SHAW,"-Concerto For Clari- net   (Victor 3H383). This recording is sure to cause *,uitc a stir among jazz critics. It's tlo first thing of its kind Shaw has ever attempted -- it lasts almost ten minutes, covering both .sides of a twelve inch disc, and in parts can be compared to Goodman's Sing .Sing Sing. l.,asl year .Shaw split up his band saying that he would form a new one, with strings, to enable him to achieve the effects in jazz that he wanted. If, by this record, Shaw has a'.hieved these desired effects, he did rot mean what he had said, as this concerto just is not jazz. It con- sists of a well rehearsed twenty-two P'ece orchestra, backing a long clari- r.et solo that shows off .Shaw's .""Super- lative technicjue. True, there are fiolos by tenor sa.v, piano, and trum- pet, and the drum background, mor* uminiscent of Sing Sing .Sing than anything el.<^, is good, but these fac- toi*s are relatively unimportant. You will either like or dislike the record .''ccording to your views on jazz, and it's a safe bet that you'll like it and think it'.-* one of the best things that Siiaw has ever done, which perhaps i>> is. If the Har\ard Crimson re- views this record it will probably dis- like it intensely becau.se its reviewer Is .something of a jazz puri.st. Your reviewer dislikes it too because he also is a jazz purisst. Rut we realize that almost nobrnly el.se in Bucknell feels the same way about it. so Con- (< rto for Clarinet will no df)ubt be rtceivcd enthusiastically. Bv the way. it is played in "".Second Chorus"" by .*?haw's band with parts omitted."

George Gershwin, after first hear- ing Ethel .Merman .sing, toW her never to take lessons or try to im- prove her voice. He said if she tried to improve it, it wouhl lose the na- turalness which made it so good. In theae seltctions from Panama Hattie Miss Merman proves how good .#he is. True, at times she goes flat, and her range isn't all that could be desired, but the i>>ers<inality and warmth she j/rojects into her voice more than makes up for what it lacks technical- ly. Th< iecord.s come in an attrac- tive album (De<-ca album No. 203)."
BENNY,
GpOD.\i^N,"Benny KideH Again and The Man I Lore (Columbiii 55001). The news that Benny Gon<lman i.s coming to Bucknell for the prom in made doubly exciting after listening tc the new band. Benny Ridex Again is one of the best examples of a band completely in the spirit of a superla- tive arrangement that has ever b>>'en performed. Eddie .Sauter was always a good arranger, but with this side, he shows himself to Ije in the ?'letch- er Henderson ilass. The band's per- f-^rmance is clean and subdued, and the leader's clarinet .sounds refresh- ing. This isn't Ju.st one i>>f (loodman's best Columbia sides, it's one of the finest things he's ever done -- and mainly because of Sauter. The re- verse features Helen Forrest in Gershwin's beautiful The Man I Ix>>ve. With material like this, and twelve inches to work with, the possibilitie.^ Sire pr.'at; as is the record. The workshop in stagecraft, first attempted in the summer school of 1910, prfived such an amazing suc- cess that it is being continued in 1941 in amplified"
form.,"Whereas the 1940 edition was organized for only half time and carried three se- mester hours of credit, the 1941 work- j ship will cover .stage design as wel: at; stagecraft and will comprise a full-time job for those who register, .'*#i.x semester hours of credit in art may be obtained for this work. Space does not permit a detailed account of the acti%'itie8 in the work- shop.    The fifteen young people en- lolled last aumnier were thrilled at the privilege of preparing sets for profe.ssional actors and assfxriating with them. The Eagles Mere Play- ers, permanently located at Eagles Mere, forty-five miles away, played each Monday evening at the Univer- sity. The workship prepared the sf-ts and attended to all stage details. Under the leadership of Dr."

Principal reason for the 12 to 15- v.eek courses, according to Dean L. C.

If the draw of a tejmis t*)iirn>>ini<<m' came out this way, the moguls of that tourney would be tearing their fnupees off- it wouM be like pairing Budge and Vines in the first round of the National Open. But don't kid yourself that the ether league is going to be any par- ty. As usual the Sammies, Demle<<, Phi Psi.<<. S. P. E.'s and"
A.,"X. M.'^ I pre going to be good -- and this year the men's training table is putting i f-.rth a team which can block and tackle, as well asd dribbU- ;ind shoot, 'also in this league. The .Sigs ar^ the defending champs. But that's as far as anyone should ! go in making predictions. Ijist year I the Ijimbda Chis were right nn the I heels of the .Sigs till the final whistle I -so don't rule them out. And who has heard that the Kappa Sigs ever put out poor basketball teams' No- 1 body. You can't count the Fijis out, for led by Good. Nolan and Tosh. they will be in there pitching them I up. .And now that we have told \-ou who is going to win league I, lets lukf a quick look at league II. The I Phi Psi five will be as usual, pretty ; snappy. The big dark horses (and jwe mean big) wnll be the Trailing"
I,"Table. (Watch .Serrao. And don't I forget Boner's intramural scoring re<""ord). The nemi<<<t should again ))ut forth one fif their fast teams and I the Sammie<<. Alpha Chi Mu's and S. '"
P.,"E.'s  wnll alt be in there till the end. And now for the finals. Who will win? Well, its rather early in the I season, and many upsets can occur j (remember Cornell-Dartmouth?) -- .so we pick the Yanks over th<< Reds in i five games -with Bobby Feller min- 1 ning twenty more for the Indians."

Bison scoring honors went to Dick McKeegan with ' 1 1 basket and 6 fouls for 8 points. ! The Frosh were outplayed through- t out the contest and were no match ' for the tall Dickinson boys who mon- ' * plized the ball under both baskets. The B. r. Frosh had a very difficult time in setting up their screen plays v/hich demand perfect timing and .rrecision to be successful, and at the 'end of five minutes of th ftrst quar- *ter they were trailing 9-1. They rtl- 'lied slightly at this point to bring 'the count to 14-8, but then bogged 'down and trailed at the half by a 'fount of 26-14. The second half was \ery much tbo .<<ame ns the first, with the home team taking numerous shots and making enough to keep atleast"
a,"14 point lead throughout. Their defense wais ret exceptional, but the Frosh just didn't seem to have their plays ironed out, and failed to get in for many 1.iy-up shots, most of their points be- ing Fcore<l from beyond the foul line. TKis game being a league contest j-uts Johnny Sitarsky's boj's in a v<<ry poor spot as far as the league I standings are concerned, this being their second consecutive league de- ' feat. But the team still has ten big ""umes to play before the league championship is decided, and there is every reason to believe that with the materisi the team now has, bet- ter things can be expected.

With 4 goals and 2 free tosses Buzas came within one point of tying the 11 markers garn- ered by Freddie Fahringer against Franklin and Marshall.

The object of this local committee, which is in keeping with the national movement of tolerance, is to create a"
more,"understanding tolerance be- lwe<<n the different religious and the campus fraternities. Richardson says that ""the meetings will be %ery in- formal and will be more or less con- ducted along the lines of a bull-ses- fdon. We will Ulk about the basis or fundamental ideas of religion and try to get a better understanding of the different faiths,"
and,
I,"believe that with under<<tar>>ding comes toler- ance"". In their meetings, the group will discuss any frictional problems that arise on the campus between vnrious groups. Through these dis- cussions an attempt will be made to solve the problems as brought before the group. .Attending the first meeting of the group were: Dr. C."
M.,"Bond, Mr. F'or- rest Brown, Mr."
Thomas,"Richards, i and President A maud Marts. It was at this get-together that President Marts epoke on the influence of toler. nvci rn life and business. TTie group met for the second time last Sunday, January 19, with Rabbi Wolk after the Student Church ser\'ice in Hunt Hall. Aiding Richardson in the foi-ward- ing of this Interfaith Group on cam- pu""h are: Marty Nolan, Bud Ijewi.<*. Herb Heaney, Bud Eisaman, Charlie Messeroll, Don Sholl. Dick Gray, Bud V'anderbilt, and Don Fish, all '42, and Bob Steamer, Dan Reinhardsen, Bob Walker, Bill Rons, Morty Silberman. r.?id A! Alexander, all '4.^. Immt>>diately following the opening of the second semester for the year '*JC-'41, there w*ill be a meeting to which two members of each sorority will be invited. The topic for dis- cvssion at this meeting of the Inter- faith Group will be the dating prob- If m between Jewi.sh men on the cam- pus and the ""sem"" girls. .Admission to these group meetings for those interested in the topic of discussion is by invitation only. In- vitation may be obtained from Dan Richardson at the Phi"
Gamma,Delta House. Richardson al.so stated that at this time in the world crisis understand- ing tolerance is of primary import- ance and is needed more than any rther time in historj-. The only way fo understand tolerance is to discuss and understand the problems of the <.ther person.

BUCKNF.I.MAN,"opinion. Practically all the students want a publication of this type, i Whether the .Antic appeals to some and not to others, makes no differ- , ence. The point is that such a peri- cfiioal is wanted. We are all interested in what to expect in the future from this maga- z.nc, how it is situated financially, and the possible opportunities for new members. The next issue of the .Antic will ap- j.ear in March. Rep<trtedly. it will b<' a larger issue. It will contain more humor and .still maintain its reputation as a non-.sarcastic publica- tion.    The suggestion has been made that it should contain more short, hinnorou.'^ accounts of campus person, a'.itie.s. without causing more than slight discomfort f<>>r those individ- , uals concerned. It will continue to in< hide short stories of the calibre i presented in the past issues. Relat-"
j,"ing to the above .suggestion, the idea ' was advanced that one represent*-"
j,"tive from each social organization could note certain humorous, yet \ harmless, incidences which happen to \ members of his group. These could i be submitted to the .Antic staff for i"
publication.,
|,"Financially, the Antic has been ' keeping its head above water. With ' more support, it will be possible to ' make it a larger, successful maga- z.ne. This year, two of the editors will | graduate Miriam M,^nsch and Paul Rochford. If the magazine is to ' continue, these vacancies must be filled. Thus there is wn opportunity !fnr new-comerr- to enter into this ac- 1 tivlty."

A,"true Rucknellian of long stand- ing is Mrs. .1. I>>. Phillips, associate professor of Knglish. It was at the old Girls' Institute and the l>ewi.sburg Academy, original forerunners of this University, where she did pre- cullege work before attending Buck- nell for the PhH. degree and later, the University of Michigan for grad uate study. With the"

Phillips has seen the cam- pus expand rapidly since the days vhen she used to instruct classes in Old Main and Taylor Hall, the forme'- location of the Knglish Department Ixfore construction of the Vaughn I iterature Building in IM.""?. Profes.sor Phillips has made liewis burg her home longer, perhaps, than any other faculty member, coming from South Jersey to attend the In- stitute, returning with Dr. Phillips after teaching public school, and thei holding Knglish classes at Bucknell for the past seventeen and one-half yrars. During undergraduate years on this campus she studied mathe- natics under the late Dr. Willi.im Cyrus Hartol, University Historian, under Dr."
W.,
G.,"Owens in chemistry, and was taught Ijitin"
by,"the lat"" Professor Rockwo(>>d. Kspecially interested in the Ro- mantic Period of Literature, Mrs. Phillips expresses a particular admir- ation for the poetry of Wordsworth. Byron.

""I think the be.st poets are thos^ who ju.st can't help themselves and must write"", said Mrs. Phillips when r:>ked what kind of p<iets she pre- fers to read. Questioned whether lyric poetry will continue to remain i opular in the future, she replied. '*It truly will, for lyrics convey emo- tions, and the emotions are human"". While touring Fmnce, Switzerland, Germany, and England several years ago with her late husband, .she \-isit- cd the lake region of northwestern England, near Scotland, where Words. v.orth and Coleridge, lived amonK other writers, and which part of Eng- land figun>s prominently in the in- spiration it has given poets for  hun- dreds of years. From her acquaint- ance with these native haunts of many Engli.sh poets, their hills and lakes of almost poetic quaintness tiiemselves, the professor derives add- >>d satisfaction in reading literature w.'th a setting placed in this comer of the British Isless Besides literature, Mrs. Phillips en- joys the opera and stag>>>> plays, a fern* of which she foupnd time to see while in New York during the Christmas vacation. Comparing recent collegiate fads as boots, beerjackets. and slacks for girls with those current when she be- gan teaching here, she reflected a mo- ment and responded hesitatingly ""Yes, students then did have their (Continued t.n paft 4)"

A,"man apart from the ordinary i-un o*"" stamp collectors is Dr. Walter H. Sauvain, assistant professor of edu- cation and acting registrar at Buck- i.ell University. He is one of th>>' rt'volutionariea in the philatelic world and his exhibition of novel stamp di.splay.s which bedeck his offico in Taylor .\nnex and his home at 1413 Market Street, I^wis- bur^, bear out this statement. For thirty years Dr. Sauvain has been gathering .stamps fiom every corner of the univer.se. The phila- trlic project is his own design and h>> claims he gets a big kick out of it .^s his collection became enlarged, Dr. Sauvain ceased to delight in merely collecting stamp.s and pasteing them in bound volumes. He went a step ahead and designee! novel schemes which tell a story in stamps. Take for example hi.s .African stamp"
map.,"To complete this he took a map of .Africa and placed it in a frame and then added stamps from everyt ountry on that continent. Pieces of red thread and red stick pins were used to join the .stamps, bordering the design, to the countries they repre.scnted. In one glance a geographical story is unfolded before your eyes via the stamp mart.

S.,"mails at Ball, Louisiana, with the result that ""Fly Ball"" is also includ- ed in the odd collection of baseball jargon. Sometimes it was only necessar>' to have a single cancellation in order t'l achieve the de.sired success of natching the ba-seball slang terms. He received .some from ""Big Run"" (Pa.), ""Centerfield"" (Utah), ""Cune"" (Tenn.), ""Twist"" (Ark.), ""Cardinal"" (Va.). and ""Fanning"" (Mo.). Dr. Sauvain's novel exhibit of sianip collecting covers a broad field and is by no means confined to sports. One display which he prizes very highly is the one which tells the story of education. In a huge frame he has carefully and systematically ar- ranged hundrc>>d8 of .stamps which are representative of the various subjects and courses taught in schools and colleges. There are .stamps depicting study in languages, music, and even child care. His display of stamps relating to mathematics contains the portraits of Leibnitz and Able, two of the greatest mathematicians in \ istory. The story of education is in itself a long and complicated one but Dr. Sauvain's collection presents :in excellent picturization of this field to the novice."
I,"Dr. Sauvain's stamp collection is amassed in eleven frames, similar to the types which enclose his map, sports, and education .stamp logs. That means, of course, he has gone b>> yond the bounds of the.se thi-ee sub- jects in expanding the joy of his hob- by. His association in the Lions Club brought the novnl idea of collecting >.tamp<< engraved with pictures of lions. He collected sixty of this kind \. :th ev<< ry tyi>e of the ferocious ani- mal  specie represented. Tlien he ar- 1 the envelope retumed to I^ewisburg j mnged the letters six inches high to v ith thr cancellation mark of Kila in ' spell out the word ""IJons"". The Statue of Liberty gave Dr. Sauvain another inkling fr)r a stamp design. He collected stamps of the .""#*imous French gift and then arrang- <d them in a beautiful pattern. .Ad ditional memorials have also been the left hand comer. Dr. Sauvain placed another stamp in the right li.^nd section of the same envelop? and whisked it away to Umpire, .Ar- kansas for cancellation by the post- t,ffice there. When the entire pro- Bucknell University, following itsjccdure was completed the following fashioned philately by Dr. Sauvain. .'early policy of having one of the armies in the first Worid War and h'^avie.st debating .schedules in collegi one of the world's most eminent writ- ers will be the first gue.st lecturer on th<< Bucknell University"

ME,

So far, there an white ones, black ones, gieen ones, white ones, pink onea, white ones, blue ones, and white ones. Others are white. Probably the result of one of two forces; the sheer mai>>culinity of it (attempt to wear the pants at Buck- i.ell), or the pure utility of the boots. Those white ones are certainly pretty."

who,made
away,"with J*L400 worth of sound rceordinj^ ap- j'.iratus and phonograph n-cords after breaking into the Buekncll SchooK of Mu.sie last Thursday night. The robbery wa.'* fliscovt-red last Friday morning by a janiti-ess arrtv- ing at the building to begin eleaniiig *work. The stolon maehinw, which v^as used to record the progre8.s of voeal"
and,"instrumental .-students, was* a Presto model and had been in aso only about two years. The records, vhlch were for the most part of classical aele<'tionp, were the gift of the Carnegie Foundation and wen- used in the mu.sie appreciation cours<<'. There wan no theft insurance on cither the reeording inaehine or the records. The looted building i.>; kept lockrd at night. Bucknell wa.s one of three lotation.s of such a complete set of recording.; which included cla.<!sical music in French, Oerman. Italian and P'nglish. All of the reeortJs have .sinee been withdrawn from the market and .1 list of serial numbers has been ob- tained and broadcast tu the police of ei^ht state.<<; as a means of identify- ing them if they are loeated. In addition to the reeords which /sre valued at $50(), a three-unit i<<- cording and amplifier outfit was taken, poliee report. S<<rial numbers of this device have also been included in the teletype broadcast sent out by police. .According to Chief of Police Orvis Campbell, of liewisburg, investiga- tion disclosed no indication of how the robbers entered the main door, unless they had a skeleton key or V. ere very adept at lock picking. The lock showed no signs of tampering, Chief Campbell pointed out. Inside the building four other doors were forced by use of a screw driver. The records were stored in a room on the second flfKtr at the front of the buildinR with the recording de- vice. .Although several rooms on the fii.^t floor were opened nothing in them was disturbed, police reported. Police have learned that the theft probably occurred between 11 p. m. Thursday and Friday morning. The machine is quite heavy and doubt was expressed today that it, along with the large number of- records stolen, could have been transported from the scene in"
a,"pleasure car, leading to the belief that a truck V. as probably used. Belief was expressed that more t'lan one person was involved. Par- attempts to dispose of the loot in ticular attention is paid to possible Philadelphia, New York, Pittsburgh, B.nltimore and Chicago. The stolen collection is one of but eighteen such units in the Cnited States."

It is three feet wide and four U'.nd one half * fet high. Dr. Marts is [in full academic gown, with hood."

I,Professor Blanchaid
Gummo,has I been in charge of planning for the I execution and exhibition of the por- trait on

Gummo,"is making suggestions j in collaboration with Mr. Poor in an I effort to render the portrait as near- ,iv perfect as po.ssible before it is joWcially dedicated to the University."
I,"Dr. Marts posed for the portrait ji:i New York City. The artist has 'been occupied with the painting of it # for more than a year. Dr. .Sigmund Speath, known to mil- lions of radio listeners as ""The Tune Detective"", will be the guest lecturer on the Bucknell Iniversity Lecture Course on March 3. Dr. Spaeth is not only the mo.-*t active figure in the musical world, he is also one of the most prominent, and his game of tracing melodie.s to their sources, as exemplified in his radio broadcasts is only a small part of his varied musical enterprises. Through his unusual musical radio program he has brought the enjoy- ment of good music to"
many,who hiive never had any musical training or talent. He will be the .second lec- turer to appear on the Bucknell Uni- versity  Lecture Course this season. Because of the record crowd which attended the first lecture
on,"the Bucknell Lecture Course, when .Andre 'daurois, world-famou.*; Frencli au- thority on international politics ad- O'essed Bucknellians,"
members,of the liecture Course Committee antici- pate a large attendance at Dr. Spaeth's- lecture.

whether,or not
students,will benefit
from,
radio,training?
Would,"the University allow its pre-mcds and engineers to wan- der about the laboratories,"
experimenting,with
equipment,any
way,"they saw fit, and then decide that"
such,
courses,were im- practical because they produced no
results?,
Yet,
the,Radio
Workshop,is an almost parallel
case.,It is true that the Uni- versity never did take more than a passive interest in the
Work-,<?hop.
The,responsibility was left to the student
managers,"of the venture, and they failcdm iserably because they lacked pro- fessional supervision, and were too lazy to"
assume,
such,a re- bponsibility without professorial prodding.
Why,"can't radio work at Bucknell have aggressive faculty sponsorship and supervision, the kind"
which,is
furnished,"to musical organizations, lebating. and"

BMI,"The American Societv of Composers, Authors, and Publishers is a monopolistic corner on the talents of song and prose winters, who are popular todav nnd forgotten tomorrow. Organized along the lines of a labor union"", they have recently set out to put the broadcaatmg companies on the spot of another union stick-up. Opposed to them is"
BMI,"(Broadcast Music, Incorporated) a sort of company union. As is normal with organized greed. .\SCAP has bitten the hand that feeds it. They chose to forget that the broadcasting ontpanies re- imbursed theni in many ways beside the dire<-t cash contracts. In- creased .sales of records and sheet music and current literature was a ilirect contribution which only the publicity and popularity of the air- waves could make possible. The public is still listening to the various broadcasts, and is ap- 1-arentlv apathetic to the virtues of this conflict. Almost without exception."
HMI,tunes are the best sellers and the must popular .-it all music stores. Even the nickel phonograph machines are prospering with
BMI,"favorites. While many old favorites are being revived, much to the delight of an older generation,"
BMI,is discovering a lot of talent who were nt.rmally barre<i by the insurmountable conditions if this brain trust. The more recent brain children of
ASCAP,"are apparently suffering from a stillbom existence or premature death. Best of all, that abomination of modern music, the saxophone, is no loiicer prominent during the present struggle. While v,e frank- ly admit that our acriuaintance with bank notes is far superior to any- thing we know abouV musical notes, we have always felt that any or- * linaiv .<ow and her youn^r litter could produce more harmony than a sax. Like the chain .stmes that have made .')? towns look alike, every- thinK out of a saxophone sounds to us like the moiiotunous ie|)etition of (^ur aborigines in their more hilarious moods. Speaking of unions in general, we are for them in theory and auainst them in practi.se. The"
AF,"of L. after many decades. ha.>: or- ganized only a comparative few working men into craft unions, and neglected almost entirely the great mass of unorganized industrial workers. .John I.. I^wis, President of the Mine Worker.-*, finally broke with that pious front of the"
AV,"of L. Mr. Green-- ghost of Goinpers-- always long on vocabulary and oratory and short on union attain- ment's. Like our great nuMlem Caesar, his leadership has more often been in revei-se. .\fter President Roo.sevelt and the .\H.-\ had pro- vided an opportunity, lA>wis organized the"
CIO,"as a competing union. Hy sitdown strikes and .social legislation of many kinds, the lot of the lommon laborer ha.s been improved. But for all these ifains, the union man can scarcely thank the l-resent leaders of the"
AF,of
L.,Neither can he thank the horse and l.ui^'gy minds on the
U.S.,"Supreme Court. In that sacred temple of outworn jurisprudence, human rights had long been on the scaffold, and property rijrhts forever on the throne. Thanks to a liberal Presi- dent's appointments, these legal chauffeurs of huggy whip-and-crupper days, have been retired to the abode ..f dead and obsolete laws where they belonir. .\t long last our .Ameri'-an wage slaves are t>eing eman- cipated and recognized for their human worth. Union leaders have not been good shepherds who have laid down their lives for their sheep. Sheep, other than those of the craft breed, were not brought into one fold. They have not been good shejiherds, but hirelings who, seeing the wolf coming, have cooperate*! with him in scattering the sheep. These false shepl.erds have cast aside and eliminatetl thi' democratic proces.ses of our .American unions. The\ liave concealed and dissipated the vast incomes of the union treas- uries, and voted them.selves enormous .salaries and expense accounts. They have- ventured into many kinds of business, and have flunked iji all of them. They have even hired non-union miners to run theii mines, purchased *-ith union funds. Their banks have freely loaned money to some of labors greatest enemies, like William Randolph Ikarst. They have accepted fat salaries from mine owners and con- tractors whom they were supposed to be lighting. They have prac- ti^ed graft and racketeering and violence, and have granted union charters to well-known criminals. Give a minor union worker a little power, and at once he becomes abusive and discourteous. Like some of our lodge members donning new regalia and sitting in a higher chair, they forthwith have visions of grandeur. But we will hand the membership ctmiinittee of the lodge this compliment: They approach new members with persuasive words and reasonable entrance fees. Only the union orjfanizer uses coercion, and charges entrance fees that would shame a respectable burglar. It has been our privilege to know many wealthy men, especially oil men. Where we were raised, they grew prolifically on oil derricks and pipelines and refineries. Kvery one we have ever known has had far more courtesy and kindness to his workingmen than any lal)or leaders we have  ever"
known.,"Some of the greatest companies, like .*^tanciard Oil. the Bell Co., Ivory Soap Co., and Kndicott-Johnson Shoe Co. have all been very solicitious of their employees' welfare. We would trust any of them to give a square deal to their employees sooner than we would labor union leaders. Krom all we have read and ob.xerved, their own fat salaries and their own security constitutes their (jreatest passion for human welfare. Our only notable exception would be Heywood Broun with his newspaper guild. Let us get to the conclusion of this whole matter. Union leaders l.ave been selfish and two-faced, trying to serve tw<<>> masters, holding to the one and despising the other. Certain employers have not jiroven themselves gomi stewards; many others would have done bet- ter if they had not continually faced cutthroat and unfair competition. If democracy is to succeed and private enterpri.ne c<mtinut-, only well- thought-out and well-enforced social legislation will be oiir best bet for ji better world. Furthermore, with clean competition enforcwd, profit- .=haring and cooperatives will make vast contributifms to human wel- fare. .And last of all, strife between capital and labor will die out when men of g<iod-will an* in the majority on both sides. Only when the law of liove is written in their hearts, only when the kingdom of lighteousness is first, will the millenium of IVaoe come to a .strife- torn worhl.

U.,Last Saturday evening the Bucknell !# reshman basketball team over-ran the .Scranton-Keystone frosh in Davis
Gymnasium,
by,
a,"sweeping 40-21 score to register their first league triumph of the current campaign. The visitors got off to a fine start in the first period when Clarke, cen- t( r, and Fahringer, forward, dropped the first points of the game a few minutes after the opening gun. The Bucknell frosh were trailing 7-9 at the close of the firs* quarter. .As the .second peril k1 commenced th'' Baby Bi.sons, through the scoring of McKeegan and IlMini. wrested the lead from the Little Giants. \l though the Bucknellians piled up )'oints, they handled the ball in a sloppy, careless fasliion. At half- time the Orange and Blue were lead- ing 18-11. .As the third and fourth periods wore on the Baby Bisons handled the ball more effectively and exhibited fine team work. After having taken the lead, the Bisonnettes kept com- mand to the finish despite the fine second-half play of Fahringer and Clarke aces of the v-isitons team. In the last  half of the fourth period an entirely new Bison team took the floor and played well together until the closing gun heralded a 40-21 ric- ton- for the local lads. By far the nutstandintf players for the Bisons were McKeegan, whose fine under-the-basket shots netted 16 -Although ""Vicky"" has travelled in"

PASSIO.N,"PROSK: This manuscript is modeled after *ihers taken from the circular file of *ne of the country's foremost literary masters, Gertrude Spine. This lady in, if not the greatest, one of the btggeMt figures in contemporary lit- erature. This might be a"" example of a paper handed in as Narration and Description when Miss Spine, in her younger days, attended college (this has been disputed!. The title of the work is From"
Adam,
On,"Down, or Gertie's (Himpse of Gladness. Once upon a time there was Glieh. Glieb was no lover Both times be- fore, the killing chill of mincing Habel squelched the fonner-lover Clieb. Glieb felt feelings. All up and down Palaestra played, plucking plums in plenty from tho plalntain trees, but Glieb just sat. (onomotopeia)."
Why,
think?,"thought Glieb. No two is both; the one are different. So Glieb kept feeling feelings. (Here the author gets naughty; with this explanation we eliminate he next two paragraphs). Glieb discus.<ied pro.saic patter with potential personages. This Glieb did, the whole, until one glorious noon, one sunny noon at lunch the vener- able and respected Glieber died, leav- hig only ashes. Only a.shes; no Glieb. Glieb rotted. Glieh stinks."

JIMOR,"Jl BII.EK: Benny Gof)dman is one of the few well-knowTi band leaders that has been on top, i^ed the title of Swing King for a while, and then put the erown on agtiin. He even recorded with the Budapest Quartet for some time, a line quite different from the one he'd been following. N'ow he is rated the year's King of Swing again. (The"
Prom,"publicity committee Ipn't paying for advertising space here; it';* simply an imderstanding between Benny and the Committee fhat prompts such .statements, an un- derstanding in the thousands."

The first real .signs of action will be Hell-week and House Party finterchan gable). Being a tame rampus to begin with (to al* appearances) the following proposi- tion would be revolutionary in a mwl- erate sort of way. The topic of con- versation has turned to Bucknell at *5, and Bucknell in the Nineties, etc. (Latin for etcetera). Organized on a basis of Bucknell in 1S90, it would bo an interesting experiment to devote one day to commemorating the rare times Rucknellians u.sed to have, by dossing in their derbies, hoops, and bnstles. and b<dng restricted to 20 minutes dating privileges. Chap- erones would accompany girls to and fr(>>m classes, and men would refrain fron) speaking to any women for the day. If anyone has any more asinine ideas like this they would like to pub- lish, here is the spot."

The,"Spanish language today is 1 steadily and substantially climbing in j importance as a result of closer co- t operation among the North and South American nations necessitated by thieatened aggression from abroad. .At Bucknell the Spanish Depart- jnent reports enrollment in Spanish I classes to have expanded by 30 to 35 ; percent in the last two years. This is in line with the strong emphasis placed on the .Spanish language throughout .American high schools and colleges, as testified by book pub- ilishers, who universally find sales of ;t<!Xtbooks in that tongue on a .shan^ upward swing. I ""A key to open the door of South .\merica"", well describes the rising I importance of Spanish. Secretary of State Cordell Hull claims that success of inter-American understanding, recently undertaken by the"
U.,"S. government, depends on the people's becoming interested in Latin .American languages, culture, and cu.stoms, which is possible no- where more su'tablv than through the medium of learning the .Spanish lan- guage.    Learning Spani.sh should bo ; supplemented or facilitated where ! possible by concentrating tourist traf- !fic to our Ijitin neighbors, he declar- ed."

Since,
we,
have,the fine

why,isn't it
being,

Why,can't
we,
have,
good,

The,
recently-formed,
Motion,Picture
"Committee,",
whose,"job it is too investigate various possibilities,"
has,
found,
answers,to these
questions,
and,
many,
more.,
We,can
have,a
complete,"pro- gram of ""Class"

movies,on the hill ; and
we,can
have,
them,at a cost that is ridiculously small
--,that is. if the
students,"indicate their desire for,"
and,willingness to
support,
them.,
The,
commit-,tee has
worked,out a plan ;
now,all that
remains,is for the stu- dents to signify their desire for
regular,
movies,
on,
the,Hill.
Will,
students,
support,
campus,
movies?,
Upon,the
answer,to that
question,rests the future action of the
committee.,
The,
enlarged,
committee,of the
Cinema-on-the-Hill,is
now,
considering,
plans,for
reviving,
motion,pictures
on,the
"campus,",in
consequence,of the
new,
statute,
outlawing,
the,"old ""block-"
"booking""",
system,
which,
made,the exclusive
showing,of
"""grade",
"A""",pictures prohibitive to small
moving,picture houses.
Whereas,the old practice forced
operators,
to,
take,half a
dozen,
"""grade","B"" or"
"""grade","C"""
pictures,
in,
order,
to,
get,one
"""grade",
A,""" picture, the"
new,
law,
makes,it possible for the small
operator,to obtain a regular run of
good,pictures.
The,
committee,is
"sponsoring,",for
Tuesday.,
February,25th. a picture
based,
upon,the life of
Robert,
"Burns,",
and,the
English,
Department,is
cooperating,by
requiring,students in
World,Lit- erature to
attend.,
The,
committee,
hopes,
that,
this,"picture,"
shown,twice on
"Tuesday,",the 25th. (7 and 9
P.,"M.), will receive sufficient"
support,
to,
warrant,
the,
committee's,
presenting,a
"""grade",
"A""",
picture,
sometime,within the
next,
month,
or,two. in order to ascertain
how,well a
"""grade",

"A""",picture (the
showing,of
which,will
depend,largely
upon,
the,
support,
given,to
"""Auld",
Lang,
"Sync""",on the 25th). the
committee,can base its
plans,for the
future.,
The,
present,status of the
plans,calls
for,
twenty,
showings,"per year, each to include ""shorts"","
"previews,",
and,other attractions ; and the cost of these
twenty,
"showings,",it is estimat- ed by the
"committee,",will not be
more,than
one,"dollar for the entire year,"
based,
upon,the participation of
the,
entire,"student body. In the past,"
"""grade",
"A""",pictures
have,
always,paid for
them-,selves. Some
have,
made,a profit
which,
was,
turned,into a loss
by,the
"""grade","B"""
and,
"""grade",
"C""",pictures that
had,to be accept- ed under the old
"""block-booking""",
system.,
The,
committee,is
convinced,that
under,the
new,
system,
good,pictures
may,be en- joyed on the hill at a cost
which,is
almost,negligible.

JUBILEE,"They say that it is better to ""let sleeping dogs lie""' and we definite- ly are not trying to i>ppo.se the sages, but last week's Jubilee deserx'e.s a bleak in oui (stimation, so let's go back and look it ovei'. It is undoubtedly true that every Post-Exam Jubilee is a remarkablf imjirovenient over the previous one and this year's was no exception to tiiat rule. It was the be.st ever staged in Davi.x (Jymnasiuni. To the Tri Delta, winners of the cup in the sorority class, we take off our hat. stan<i up and cheer, and finally offer them collectively all the orchids that Winchell has been handing out for the past ten years. The quintcs.sence of that statement is ""they were terriflic"". Never in the three short years of Jubilee hi.story have we seen a better presentation on the part of any of the sororities or fraternities. Their imitation of Phil Spilalny's all girl orchestra was tops. To Miss Poling, the vocalist of the Tri Delt presentation, goes this columns orchid.s, and believe you me, we haven't enough to pay the young lady tuting tribute. Her vocalizing on "".Night and Day"" was .sensational, as was the background supplied by the chorus. It is an old trick in vaudeville to wave the American flag or sing the ""ytar Spangled Banner""' if you can't get the crowd on their feet in"
I,"any other way. The Tri Delts u.sed the latter on Thursday, but not in the old vaudeville sense. They had the audience in a mood where they would have cheered Hitler had he walked across the gym floor. In shoi-t the Tri Delts had everything but a regiment of Marines, and beyond all shadow of a doubt had the cup clinched from the moment they sang the first note. To Delta Sigma fraternity, winners of the first prize in the fratern- ity class, we offer double congratulations. They used the time worn ""Little Red Riding Hood"" story, but gave it a modem twist by adding a couple of dictators. It was a real task foi- the judges to pick a win-"
I,"ner in the fraternity class, due to the fact that every skit presented by the men was nothing more than slap-stick comedy. Several interpreta- tions of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" were presented, but the dictator angle brought the cup home to the Demie mantle. Some of the skits were rather personal in nature and really came ' down to fine points on several matters, which in our opinion was not in keeping with the spirit of the Jubilee. .A little satire goes a long way. and the Post-Exam Jubilee is not the place to air any grievances be- tween persons or social organizations. .After three years of steady im- provement we can't wait for next year's Jubilee. V A"
RSITY,".<HO\V The (|uestion of a varsity .show is (me that always tinds its way into the wastebasket at Bucknell. .\fter seeing the amount of talent that trod the hoanls of Davis Gymnasium in the Jubilee, how could anyone doubt that Bucknell has more than enough material for a real, honest- to-goodnes.s, Varsity Show."
A,"former compatriot of ours, and a member of the fourth estate, who sat at this same typewriter last year, was al.so a firm believer in BucknelTs theatrical ability, ;;nd acutally got the ball rolling toward a Varsity Show. He never got very far, they left him hanging in mid-air and incidentally s<iuelched his ambitions. He even went so far as to contact a director from Penn State to direct a Varsity Show on the cam-"
pus,"and he was left holding the bag. It would take work to put on a Varsity Show, and ))lenty of it, but the results should ti-uly be worth the effort. Why <<loesn't Bucknell wake up and do .something that would refltHt the talent of the entire .student body for a change, or would stu- dents rather talk about the great Varsity Shows put on by other univer- sities -"
SEND,
HITLEK,"\ TELE(;RAM We have heard of many uni<iue methods of attracting fan mail, but never have we heard of a more expensive method than the one now be- ing u.std by the German Government. During a recent broadca.st from the dictator nation, the announcer of the program told the American people in perfect F^nglish that .Adolf would certainly like to hear from his .American fans, and if there was anyone who was desirous of communicating with the (ierman strong man they couhl do so by telegram. There were no catches to the proposition either as the nirlio announcer invited them to send all wires collect. The announcement barely ceased jarring the loudspeakers of Amer- ica's millions of radios before the communications offices were swamped with telegrams for the German Dictator. One stipulation was involved: all telegrams had In be held to a maximum of I'y word.s, or $2. IK worth of American vocabulary, and that's a lot of vocabulary in any man's languag. Many of the telegrams found their way to wastebaskets in telegraph ( ffices as they weio to obscene to be sent over the wire. Thou.sands of otiicrs were sen;. They criticized, pleaded, condemned, au'l offered i)lain ad\ice to Mr. Hitler and hi.s Italian compatriot. To us it's still a niighty expensive way to receive your fan mail."

This room is on the I ground floor between the two reading I rooms. .At present, the room is kept locked and now contains a conglomer- .ntion of material from the history of l<ucknell to rare old books and ar- ticles  and pictures of the World's Fair. , With an eye to the future, Mr."
Hayden,
and,"his assistant. Miss Kvans, a'^"" beginning to sort, label and file all of the material that has been gathered in this room over a period of years. Their hopes are that their work may aid in the com- piling of Bucknell's first hundred yeai-s of historv-. .Also looking into the not too far distant future, Mr. Hayden sees visions of a Bucknell Room in the new librar>- where the history, catalogues, papers and all material pertaining to Riirknell ma, be kept. This room niight well be calleil the , library's treasure che.st for it con- itjiins very old editions of the Bibl>> in Greek and Ijitin and many other religious volumes whose pages an' did and rrackly. Mr. Hayden says he believes that there are more rare and old editions tucked away in the stacks of the librar>"" ami that as he ; di.<<covers them, he puts them in the Tuiknc II rr)oni. Here again, Mr. Hay- Hen is gathering material for the iPtw library which is to contain a room for old editions and rare and i valuable volumes. Going along the shelves, one next finds a complete file of Bucknell's * atalogues from the very first twen- ty-three page edition of 1S.')0-51 to our own two hundred fouity-five page . vchmie. There are also stacks of boxes all labeled, or being labeled, v.'th such h.'adings as: handbooks. ritograms, an<i invitations. In another comer of the room there j.re a few scattered e<litions of Buck- fell's former literary efforts. Th * first publication. The College Herald. came out in 1S69 and lasted for 12 years when a (juarrel between thrf jartners, the Enipia and Thet.i Al- pha   Literary Societies, dissolved the t>ublication.

' Representing the time from 1900 'tn lO.'^r.. four different magazine* jwere found: ""Orange and Blue IJt- |<<rary S\ipnlemer.t"", ""Der Zut-Geist"", ""The Whv"". and ""The Apple Cart"". > * >"

For,
Horses,"The modern urban dwellers have only a slight acf|uaintance with <<-<|uestrian life. Bridle paths, race coui-scs. and a few n-innants of delivery service provide a glimpse of a picture of the era preceding horseless eairiages. Automobiles and trucks have larpely replaci^l the noblest Roman of all the animal"
kingdom.,"Kven on the farm, mo.^st of the motive power is no bmger oats and hay but gasoline and keio.sene. War itself, bom in barbarism and reared by greedy busi- ness in th<>> gui.se of patriotism, has outm<Kle<l the Imrse in battle. Outlawed by war itself, the horse is .<<till suffering the pangs of lull through its new masters of tornnnt. HdhwiuMl. as a greedy monger of entertainmeJit. has assumed the hading role in cruelty to dumb animals. We refer particularly to western picture.'*, that para- di.se of the nionm and the gullible. .N'ow-that we are to hav<- tw"" movie houses, we assume that the cheaj-er on<<' will specialize in tiirill- er and spiller pictures. Not that we aie averse to clean pictures, for we have a great fondness for them, we nevertheless object strenuously to ;t business that tortures animals for movie thrills. We would like to warn our lo*'al friends that their patronage encourages and aids :ind aliets this ciintinued cruelty. Their habitual attendanr;' on these things is .""ilent consent, and makes th< m almost as guilty as Holly- wood itst If. They become first cousins to the followers of the Spanish bullfight. in brief, all knuls of animal.- are loitured to turni.sh Ihudish de- light to cruel-hearted movie fans. The slaujfliter and sulTering will continue until our protest is felt at the box office. Money alone talks, and our attitudes, like those of a Konian holiday, are either thumbs up 01 thumbs down -- either mercy or continue<l cruelty. We an' told that the temler iik rcies of the wicke<i are cruel. Which remind.- us of the wealthy gentleman in Texas who, protesting ;igainst the cor- [>oral punishjpent of prisoners, was assured that it was practically :i painless punishment. His answer wa.s the offering of a large .sum of money to any official who would suffer this punishment. His monetary reward is still beguing for a volunteer. Like our college hazers. the \ellowe8t and <lirtiest one in the bunch is the one with the biggest paddle. Horses in particular are given a dirty deal. Their agoni/.<<><l death groans are conveniently left out f)f the picture. To one who has .seen at a distance and heard over a mile away the cruel crie.* of wild hoi-es as they are ""broken "" for domestii.' use on the western Kansas prairies, we shudder as we slightly appreciate the <leath strug- gles of these helpless beasts. Every time yn\i see a horse fall head- long, stretched out in all shapes of horrid cruelty, you can assure your- self that he has suffered and died for your entertainment. As many us six hoises are killed in the filming of a single picture, as W4>ll as njistn-atment for many others. There aie several methods used in the nuMciless aHlictinn of the .mimals of the movie world. Spectacular and sensaticmal effects are pKMluced by hidden pitfalls, the forcing of horses into blindfolde<l jumps down precipitous mountainsides, by remote control through ^vires attached to their forelegs, and worst of all by instruments of torture worthy of the Infjuisition, to pnxl <in reluctant beasts t<<) their doom. Many stories are told of various animals. Huskies, the trans- l)oitation kings of the far north have been starved to force them to (iKht wolves. One elephant, forced to cross a bridge against his b<<'t- lei judgment, had blood oozing from over a hvuKlrwl wounds-- and what a thrill we probably got oUt of that one! We are well aware that the Hays office of the movie indu.stry is constantly trjing to raise the standards of the hlms. Many fine men ,nre cooperating with him in this worthwhile endeavor for wholesome lecreation. We know that their efforts are often futile, because pub- lic support it>> more often in the gutter than in the hills. If we wnnt (leaner mi>vies, let us cast our balb-ts at the box offu-e. the rmly crit- ( rioii that llollywooil uiulei>tands. If we desire wanton cruelty t"" dumb animals, our tacit consent is .<j11 that is necessary: just ke^p on going. But let u.x riMiiernber that he who digs a pit shall fall therein; that even if Hollywood l.-ads the jiack on the jtrimrose path that, lea>>b; to the everla.'>>ting l;ontire. we too shajl have ringside .seats. With apologies to th>>^ American Weekly .Magazine and .Marjyri.i lles.se, a lover of good horsirs and a ciusader .-iji.-iin^t cruelty."

Bucknell began athletic relation- ships with Michigan State last Feb- ruary, when their Ixjxing: loam tied the Bisons 4-4 at Davis Gymnasium.

The trip marks the first time a Rii<<<<<<nell tmin has visited the Michigan State campus, which is beautifully situated on the outskirts of East l^ansinir. a small residential town of 4500.

The,"Mu.ssermen displayed their *""^ypical fast broakinp game against the Dutchmen which they had previ- ously beaten .50-20 in Davis Gym.

The Wacky heavyweight class, the Bison boxers had lots of trouble holding the Philly s'uggers in check; and it fell to th(c) lot of Coach Joe Reno's ""G-Men"", Marv Gerla and Frank Garro, to aa- .<<ure a tie for the locals. Garro met unexpected oppositioa from tough Tony Ciani, making hia intercollegiate ring debut, in the early rounds of the fight. Ciani, a elver hooker, fought sporadically and tired too fast to figure much i'l the third round millings, but his style puzzled the dark-skinned 145-pounder no end in the opening minutes. Harold ""lied"" Gotwals. the Temple 165-lb. entry, was the victim of Ma*-- vin Gerla's second"

Y..,"who was given his first taste of the resin last week, Gotwals went down from a phantom punch."
A,"short right hand chop, which few of the fans saw, stopped the red- head's athletic endeavors for the eve- ning, and in justice to him -- up until then, he was doing all right by dear old alma Gotwals. Down for a full count, he rose tn meet a similar bar- rage, and on hitting the canvas a second time, referee Joe McGuigaii halted the proceedings. The other Bucknell point was earn- ed by Herb Jordan and I-^arl Gross, :i newcomer, when thcv split decis- ions.

The Budapest String Quartet, who will appear here on Tue-sday, March 11, at the I/<wisburp High School was h>>?ard for the first time in America in 1931 and has played over one thousand concerts during- the la.st ten years, a record which is rare among chamb<<T music organizations. The four artists who comprise this ensemble play some of the finest in- struments of old Italian make. The first violin is a Petrus Guanerius; the viola a Grancino; the 'cello a .1. B. Gudagnini; and the second violin a Panctus Seraphin. Always following their American tour thep appear in Paris, then play a series of Victor Records in Eng- land. Four years agt) they played fiur concerts in one week in Paris which resulted in the greatest tri- umph they have ever ha<l. and which they doubled the next season when they played before a sold-out house at Salle Gaveau and enjoyed an over- whelming .success.

I,"hop.- to manage it. You ""wonder how we are ever standing the horrible war"". 1 cannot tell you, unless it is that one has to. Many, many folks are going elsewhere, but I do not think there is a safe place in all England nor even Walo.s. My friends, the Wheatlcys had to ^ evacuate their nice home at St.-I^eonards-on-Sea. have gone to a village in iShropshire which is in th<' Midlands, which heretofore ha.** l)een (|uite .safe, but which all last week hat- boon heavily"

I,do not know which town in the county they moved to. but I'm praying they escaped. Wr havf had very bad raids at niRht. particularly on Thursday last.
A,"honih was <lropped on a hou.sc (nowhere near a war obje<<tive) and it ex- ploded and destroyed two houses, killing two people. It happened about a quarter of a mile fn>>m hf-re. Another exjiloded in our own road and all the folks ran out after the alarm. This wa.s at about 2'M a. m.. a lovely moon- light night. Many windows in this vicinity were broken, but"
I,"had only one, the one in the front sitting room. However, streets nearer here had doors blown off and roofs daniagde. In a working class neighborhood they also had one bomb which fell into It tree unexpUxled. so the three hundiwl folk had to turn out at once and go to various places of refuge such as the Mission Hall. vU\ Fortunately it was TTioved before it went off and they were able to retuni home. P(K>r souls ^ what a life; some young girls with young children and hushamis away fight- j ing. It has b<>>en quieter here since, but dreadful in Ixmdon I hear. Our Air Force certainly has been wonderful, hut you are right, 1 was very foolish not to make a bee line for America. Had"
I,"known what we were in for I think 1 should have come but we must hoiv for the best. It is a glorious sunny da> but one cannot go out and enjoy it while there are constant raids and alarms.

Unfortunately, however, the names of the repreaentativew from each sorority haven't been kept entirely secret. Those things have a way of getting out it seems, but its hard to blame the Sem women for not keeping name>. of the chosen 21 to themselves. ""Father"" won't mind footinx a new dretw bill this time, enpecially if daughter knows in advance she's represent- ing her class; friend date will also have time to see that his tux or tails are spick and span.

IWating the eyeglass makers at their own game has been currently a fad for the last few week.s. It seems that bright colored rims were so attractive thai some of the co-eds couldn't do without them. InHtead of buying the expensive objects, the women's college went to work and conceived the idea of painting the rims of their present glasset* with red nail polish.

GRAIL,
OF,
MERIT,One of the principal sims of
any,"college fraternity is to serve as a rounding influence in shaping and coloring a young man's college career. Fraternity has as a primary purpose the task of discovering ,t host of diversified interests in the"
men,"it pledges each year, and uniting these interests into a workable and well-balanced pattern which will contribute to the prestige and advancement of the fraternity, but which will, in a larger phase, give added meaning and significance to the individual s four years of college experience. What fraternity at Bucknell best serves itself, its alma mater, and its"
men,in furnishing this rounding influence?
Which,"one of our 11 Greek brotherhoods contributes most to Bucknell each year by encouraging its men to shape their col- lege activities so as to broaden their interests, increase their ca- pacities for the duties of responsible"
campus,"citizenship, and motivate their ambitions toward constructive service to the Bucknell"
community?,
A,group of men from the Interfraternity Council is cooper- ating with Dean Page and Mr. Paul Hightower this semester in an effort to determine which social fraternitv at Bucknell is most outstanding in the
above,respects.
Dean,Page's
group,"has drawn up a ""table of merit"" which will be used in ascertaining which fraternity contributes most to Bucknell during the course of a year. Each house will be judged on a point system, includ- ing such things as scholarship, athletics (both intramural and varsity), scholarship, number of"
men,"in honoraries,"
and,the number of outstanding men in extra-curricular activities. The primary purpose of this judging will be to pick a fra- ternity winner for a new trophy which is being
awarded,"next fall by Rush Kress, prominent Bucknell alumnus, ""to that fra- ternity group which has contributed most to Bucknell during the course of a"
"year"".","The cup will be presented at the first chapel after convocation next fall. This year's activities will serve as the basis for awarding the cup. The new ""Rush Kress Cup"" represents the"
most,worth- while trophy which has ever been offered to Bucknell fraternity
groups.,"It is true that our fraternities arc often considered to be ""cupped to death"". This may or may not be the case. How- ever, here is a trophy which seems to"
emphasize,the achieve- ment of the most vital function of fraternity. It is a
common,"tendency of fraternities to ""specialize"", and neglect a diversity of interests for concentration upon one activ- ity. Thus we have ""athletic houses"", ""scholarship houses"", and ""social houses"". This tendency narrows and cripples the ideals upon which true fraternity is"
based.,"It ha.s been pointed out that fraternity is supposed to present a rounding factor in a col- lege student's career. If too great an emphasis is placed upon one phase of campus activity, this primary function of fraternity is completely lost. The new Kress Trophy will be a step"
m,"the direction of eliminating this activity-specialization evil. It will be a level- ing influence, motivating all Greek groups toward a diversifica- tion of interests which will in turn lead to a more valuable sys- tem of fraternity life at Bucknell."
'SUGAR,

5PICE',
When,the final cclebraters of Bucknell University's 95th Birthday trooped out of the huge dining
room,
of,
New,"York City's Hotel Astor late in the evening several weeks ago, they left behind them a very beautiful but unfortunately very perish- able monument. The gigantic birthday cake, more than three feet high, which had been concocted especially for the gala occa- sion by one of the city's greatest chefs, stood forlornly"
on,"the banquet table, its gaudy icing and elaborate spangles reflecting >>adly the glory which had been its destiny but a few minutes The festivities were over, and the great mountain of pastry had served its purpose efficiently. It had had not one crumb of its delicious interior nibbled. But that had not been its desig-"
Mted,purpose
anyway.,It had been a symbolic addition of color to a great American university's celebration of its 95th an-
Mr,Edgar Snyder. President of Bucknell's
New,York Alumni Association came back intft the banquet hall after all the others had left and saw the great cake sitting in lonely splendor on the great banquet table.

THE,"LAST? .,, Tomorrow night Bucknellians take their Ix-st bibs and tuckers dow?i from the shelf, shine their shoes, don a new cout of the latest in scarlet linKernail polish and head for the Davis Gynn where Benny Goodman will i-ule for the better part of five hours with the hottest clarinet to awaktn the echoes of the Gym since Shaw. What we want to know is ""Will this be the la.st in l)ig ""name"" bands to play for Bucknell ;lass dances?"" I'erhaps it is an unknown fact to a gitat many Bucknellians that if one of the class damos, hiring a ""name"" band, takes a dive into the re<i side of the ledg-er, it will be the sudden death of Bucknell dances headlined by bi^ names in danceland. In short if tomorrow iiij;lil's dance is a financial failure there will be a shortaRf of such names as Glen Miller, Glen Gray, Will Osbonie, Kay Kyser, .\rtie Shaw, and Benny Goodman at Bucknell's class dances. If for instance one of the class dances turns out to be a dud, and after the last theme sohr is played the committee can't possibly put enoujfh digits on the pay-of^ check somebcHly is ifinjf to l>e embarras- sed. As a whole, class treasurie.s are always aa empty as Charlie Mc- Carthy's head, and if the class spon.soring the dance can't pay, who will supply the necessary funds? To ask any other organization or even th*- college to stand back of a rubber check is something that just i.sn't cricket, besides if you can find just such a Santa Claus you've solved a lot of problems for campus organizations. It is entirely up to the student body. If Bucknellians want to con- tinue with select bands for the big dances, the patronage will have to be excellent to keep the financial results out of the red."

THEKK?,".#\t the Franklin and Marshall basketball game in the Davis Gymnas- ium last Friday. If you weren't you mis8e<l the finst bit of real .school spirit displayed at any Bucknell athletic event in many a day. Yes, be- lieve it or not the crowd actually had one organized cheer, as one of the hottest games ever played in the gym hit the home stretch. We were trailing by six |)oints, bul the lx)ys were putting up a great fisrht, when all of a sudden the crowd realized that they ow^-d tho.>^ five men on the floor, with Bucknell written on their jerseys, something more than mere attendance at the"
game.,"Then, will miracles never cease, it canif. Not all at omv understand. It was rather weak at first, but in less than ten seconds an organized cheer r<Kked the steel rafters in all its .<*|)lendoj'. It is (-ntirely possible that the boys on the floor heard it, becau.se big Ed Glass swept down the flo4>r and hung up two point.s in a matter of split seconds. Yes, we are thoroughly convinced that you hav<<' to have a winning team or the chance to pull a crushing upset before the crowd really comes out of its shell."
A,"really close game can bring applause .some- times, but the big pay-off for the crowd has to be the possibility of win- ning the league pennant, or smashing .'iome other tpains hope.-, with an upset victory. To the few Bucknell students who started the cheer in the gym on Friday goes this week's orchids. They probably felt like outcasts start- ing that chcei. but the reward was worth it. .May thy do it again soon."

AHOLT,"TAI.KNT? Last week when w*- talked about a Varsity .Show for Bucknell Uni- versity w<<' weien'l just pushing a fesv words around, we were .serious about everything we said. This week we are l>ack with more proof tliat Bucknell could put '>n one of the best collegiat*- Varsity Shows cv.-r at tempte<l. Duiinp the coui-se of the past weekend we were able to see some of Bucknell's talent in a<ti<>n, and we were more convince<l than 'ever that a Varsity Show is thi- thing. On a radio program last Sunday we heard Dave Koinhauser play several tunes that have never been touched by the"
ASCAI',or
B.MI.,"Original lun>>'S, ai ranged by Dave himself, and we want to say right here that they have untold po.ssibilities. An interetiting fact about Dave's musical ability is that he can't read .1 note, bul he has niu.sic in his fingers and he has no trouble finding the right keys. During the course of the broadcast he playcni a number call- ' ed ""I ('an't Sleep"" that would surpass many BMl tunes, were they play- ed in competition. Dave said that he got the idea for that tune after a hard session on  the stage with Cap and Dagger, but it doesn't matter ' how he got it. the fact is it's one of the smoothest numbers we have heard in many a month. Dave also had a number on the novelty side called ""The Court.ship ! of Miles Standisli "" that would be a hit in any varsity, or even a broad- way,"
show.,"His tunes are catchy, the lyrics linger in your mind, and the melodies are smooth. Dave is only one of several song writers on the Bucknell"
campus.,They represent a wealth of material that could be turned into a real varsity show. We heard loinn^rs over the weekend that a plan f>>r a show is taking
form.,"All we can say is, ""May it be soon'"" Monday night the University Ar? tist Course presents Dr. Sigmund Spaeth the inteniationally Known tune authority in a recital which has a style and originality all its own. Dr. Spaeth is well known to radio audiences for his i)rogi-am entitled ""The Tune Detective"". The program is to be a varied one, a.-- Dr. Spaeth is uni(|ue aming Die members of the musical profession, 111 that he not only has a wide range of recital  pieces, but also that he can trace each of these compositions to itF source. This practice, once a hobby, hn.s now developed into a life'.' work. He now specializes in tracing original melfKlies and is frequently a witness in lawsuits charging musical plagarism. His knowle<lge of his .subject has eau.sed him to become a lecogni/ed authority on musical"

The lads from Carlisle hold three .straight victories over the B. |U. Bison courtmen, and revenge will jbo foremost in the minds of our htM' Iketeers. Despite the closeness of the 'games, the Gettysburg Iwys have al- ways  managed to come out on top, and two of these victories may be rredLited to ""Stretch"" Trimmer, whose sensational shooting, especially in the j closing second of play has >ipelled de- feat for the Mussermen."

The room will offer a number of fiiCilities to both men and women stu- dents, among which will be ping-pong tables, bridge-tables, a fire-place, at- tractive Venetian blinds, the sale of food, and a l<<tely-in.stalled coca-cola machine. The committee, consisting of Dean Dyer, Janot Cri-stadora. '41, and Elsa Butterworth, '41, began plans for the room early last November. Princip- <<ily through the close cooperation of President .Mart^ and Dr. Mary Wolfe, of the Board of Trustees, the task of netting the room up has been accom- plished so rapidly. The new recreation room will be furnished in the very latest in play- room furniture. The opening cere- #lony is being planned a.s a real occa- rion for Rucknellians. It will have all the pomp and ceremony of New Tork'a ""First Nighter"" combined with the collegiate atmosphere of *addle shoes and ankle socks. Interior decorations, consisting of maple panels for the walls and appro- priate fixtures for the soda bar arc being handled by John Wanamaker, Inc. More than"

Efforts,"The present rising cost of living is affecting the budgets of all colleges, ,and the trustees of Buckneii have voted an increase in the tuition, ef- fective September, 1941, of $1.00 per Bi>mester hour. Announcement ofthf new tuition rate is made in the 1940- 41 catalogue which is now ready for distribution. The increase represents a 10 per- Icent advance over the present tuition Irate only. There will be no increase I in other charges and fee.s. University i officials said. If any student now in college finds that even this moderate increase in tuition imperils the continuance of his ior her education at Buckneii, the Committee on Student Aid will en- deavor to give special help in meeting the situation. In this connection it is well to re- state what every non-profit college .'ind university has announced so fre- C'lently -- it costs *'ver>' college much I more to educate a .student than the .student pays. The balance is pro\id- c-d by the voluntar>- gifts of public- j spirited men and women, living and I dead, who have wished to encourage j choice young people in their educa- itional ambitions."

THREE,by Dick (Jray
ONCK,"IN A WHFLK: We don't want to harp on the Prom anymore; it's all over now; but the late arrival of ""Benny"" and the band Friday night prompted a rare occa- sion here at the old Academy. It wa.s not pressure put to bear; it was simply the good graces of the members which compose it that caus- ed the administration on a (piicq de- cision to allow .^:30 permissions to all girls in the Sem of voting age; this Aoting-age clause caused"
a,"lot of trouble (according to .statistics gath- er<<'<l Friday night, 418 girls took part in the last election). Mo.st people didnt know^ about the qualification. All minors, and there mu.st have been a few, were given until .3:00 o'clock to go out and have that last coca- cola before bedtime. This is the first, possibly the second time in the history of Bucknell that mich a radical breeze has blown through this .section of Buffalo Coun- ty. In 1H4H once, .Alexander Hamil- ton Kvser was ten minutes late set- ting up his bandstand on third floor Taylor Hall, so the girls were allowed to spend that much extra time out after the dance, which gave them until ten after nine to be in. Alex- ander's (ragtime) band had missed the afternoon plane out of Peoria, then but a sand-hole in the desert, and had telegraphed they would be late for the '4R Jazz-classic, which is Btill being talked about among all the local Alumni cluba."
BORN,
TO,SWING:
A,"good way to build up a spirit of competition among bands is to an- nounce one's appearance at another'.s dance; when the cheering for another band is so loud an orchestra can't play and b<' heard, it's bound to boost the calibre of the latter. If we do this every time we have a name band here for a class dance, we'll have managers up in New York fighting over who's going to get that Bucknell contract; at least it's logical to sup- #pone; at least we could try; at least. An>-way, they certainly pick noth- ing but the top-notch bands for the dances around here."

j,"(Ed. note: This is the fourth in a series of letters written by an f4-year-oId British woman to her relatives in this country.) 45 Crescent Road, Bromley,"
1,"Kent, England. My dear James and Family, i have not gone to Bridport after all. I was ready and waiting to go, having sent a porter to fetch my luggag(> to the railway when the postman handed me a letter saying the raids had started there again and things were very bad. Fortifications are being built and the folks thought it would b""? j better for me not to go there. Thei-e seems to be no place where one can be .safe now. There is a terrific raid going on at the present time. The heavy gun fire makes me so ner\*ous and the house shakes quite a bit. 1 .should like to have gotten away from this for a time, but every place is so crowded and .so expensive. I had not heard from my near neighbors, the Tolfers, for a long time, so"
I,"got ready to do down this morning. Then the air raid warning siren went loflT and the raid lasted for nearly two hours. After it was over I determined to ifo down anyway and when I reached the comer near their house there was a huge crater made by a bomb which had just fallen. They were ver>' shock - led that I should have ventured out, and had me stay for lunch. The siren 'went on again in the afternoon so I stayed until after the ""all clear"". This evening the sirens started again very soon after the blackout. .\"
I,"great many bombs were dropped near (three word.<>> censored) some were the time ones, causing several of the roads to  be blocked off. I have no wish to leave my house but the drone of Gemian machines is very nerve racking. They are fitted up with (three words censored) bombs. One can only trust in God and leave the rest to him. We still believe that we .shall be victorious though not yet awhile. It seems a long time since I have heard from you although I suppose it isn't. Life here seems more uncomfortable than dangerous;"
I,"have not been able to sleep undressed at night for three months. 1 have also lest quite a bit of weight. We have had two nights of heavy gunfiring. T^st night an enemy plane wat shot down on top of two houses in a working class neighborhood near here. But so far we are safe. The raids start ver>' early now, soon after the blackout. I wonder where it all will end. .Are you glad Roosevelt was re-elected? Much love to you all, your loving sister,"

BUCKNELL'S,
LENTEN,
SEASON,
With,a
majority,"of the world's greatest countries in arms,"
and,ripping their
own,
"economic,","social, and political vitals apart with the fangs of war, the"
observance,of the
Lenten,"season, al- ways such a"
sacred,
part,of
every,
Christian,"nation's religious doctrine,"
seems,
almost,ironical in
the,face of
the,adversities
with,
which,civilization finds itself beset
from,
every,side. But it
remains,the sacred
covenant,erf
any,nation
and,
group,within that nation
which,is
capable,"of so doing, to"
preserve,the spirit
and,
meaning,of
the,
Lenten,"season, that"
period,
in,the calendr^r of the
Christian,
Church,
which,is
undoubtedly,
more,filled
with,
meaning,
and,significance
than,
any,other.
Such,a task is
worthy,of the spirit and
ambition,of
Bucknell,"University,"
and,the
students,on this
campus,
have,
accepted,this responsibility
with,a
vigor,
surpassing,"that of other years, be- cause they"
have,
come,"to the realization, that the"
United,"States,"
one,of the last
surviving,
"democracies,",
must,not
only,
preserve,the political
and,social
philosophy,for
which,our
country,"stands,"
and,
upon,
which,it
was,
"founded,",but it
must,also carry
on,the heritage of the
Christian,"faith,"
must,
bridge,the
gap,
which,has
been,torn in the culture of the
world,
by,the
ravages,of sense- less war.
The,
Bucknell,
Christian,
Association,has
planned,an exten- sive program of
addresses,
by,
some,
of,
the,
most,
prominent,
speakers,
on,religion in this
country,
during,
March,
and,April.
Mr.,
Roy,
McCorkle,will be the first of these
speakers,
on,this
Sunday,
"morning,",
and,he will be
followed,
by,
men,of the
same,
calibre.,Dr.
John,
W.,
"Thomas,",
successful,
worker,
with,
urban,
and,ethnic
groups,in
New,
York,City.
Chairman,of the
Federal,Council's
Committee,on Cities
and,
New,
"Americans,",
and,"a con- ference speaker of note, will"
speak,the
following,
Sunday.,After
him,will
come,Dr. Albert
W.,"Bevin,"
famous,author
and,"lecturer,"
and,
one,of
America's,
most,
distinguished,
pulpit,
orators.,Dr.
Paul,
E.,
Sherer,will
speak,the next
Sunday.,
He,has often sub- stituted for Dr.
Fosdick,on the latter's radio
sermons,over the
NBC,
"hook-up,",
and,is
known,"for his writings,"
"teachings,",and lectured not
only,in this
"country,",
but,
abroad,as
well.,Rev.
Clarence,
Cranford,will also
speak,
during,
Bucknell's,special
Lenten,
program.,
Rev.,
Cranford,is the
authof,of the
famous,boys'
book.,
"""Larry","""."
and,a
speaker,
who,has
proven,to
have,a great
appeal,for
students,in his
past,
Bucknell,
chapel,lectutes.
The,
Lenten,
season,at
Bucknell,has a
greater,significance this
year,
than,it
has,
even,
had,
before.,
Realizing,"this, the ad-"
*ministration,
has,
sought,
to,
bring,to the
campus,
during,"this time,"
men,
who,will
give,
Bucknellians,
"assurance,",
confidence,"in their religious heritage, inspiration to carry on the task"
which,
has,
been,so
miserably,flouted
by,
those,
men,
who,consider
themselves,
gods,
above,"all other gods,"
and,
who,have forced
upon,"One of our fellow columnists saya in his own copy Uu>> week ""-Any- way they certainly pick nothing but the top-notch bands around here"" and believe-you-me he certainly handled a mouthful with that line. Ywj sir. we certainly know how to pick 'era at old Bucknell. in I'HCt we re running a close second to Bing Ci-OHby, in fact we didn't even place, in fact we didn't ew*n show, in fact *ve were left at the post holdijig a .slight deficit uf $200, which ain't fodder at any man's university. Oh there won't be a scandal. There ai* not going to be any rub- ber checks passed to covei' the obligations incurred by the committee. It seems that Uie clasH treasury has held in its mercenai^ raaw the not s<> nominal suni of $700. and all will be right with the world. In- cluding Benny Goodman. So everybody relaxes, and the Senior Ball Committee jumps on the band wagon and waves the name of"
Tommy,"Dorsey under the col- lective noaes of the .student body, not to mention Mr. Goodman and hla band, and once more tradition Ls saved at Bucknell for the nooninal sum of $1,750. ""So What?"" says you. Well just this. Why in the name of com- mon 9<'nse doesn't a class dance committee save iUvelf a lot of head- aches and hire a band that charges a reasonable price?"
Why,"don't Bucknelllins come down off of their high horse and admit that they can dance to the music of a band that coats $800 as well as they can dance to one costing $1,750. Why must Biickncll class committees bow down and pay top notch prices to the migbtieflt mc^ols of danceland? The answer to these last questions is quite evident. The Bucknell dance committee even suggested a name like Raymond Scott or Johnny student body would wail and moan like some lost mouI if"
a,class Magee. Why we would be throwing Bucknell prestige out the window for the sake of a few paltry dollars. So to keep the campus satisfled the class dance committees have been running so close to distaster time and time again that it ha-^ become traditional for faculty ad^-is- ors and students on the committee to grow a few gray hairs and loee a couple of days sleep. Oh yes. most of the dances held on the camipus in the past four years have been financial suocesaes. if you can call breaking even a financial success. Even to eke out a two dollar profit throws commit- tees into fits of joy. If you will recall one dance this year that did make good it wa.s the Soph Cotilllan. and if you try hard you will also recall the band wa.s signed for appn)ximately $700.
We,"have nothing against Mr. Goodman or Mr. Dorsey and we feel sorry for Bucknellians. dance conunittees, and faculty advisors."
Why,"don't they all get together and save each other timie, money, and headaches. If the Junior class were to write out a check for the Christian Association's recreation center for the sum of $200, or in- vest in Bucknell'.^ new Rtcieation Room, or buy $200 worth of books for the library, it would be a truly worthwhile gesture. As it is they just tO!<.sed the $200 out thf window. It may be that Bucknell will heed the record of the last dance and profit bit it. $1.7,W is a lot of coin for Mr. Dorsey. si>> dig you col- legians, or admit that Bucknell can get along without thr- biggest names in dance land. \\U\ NtXi IMC.Vl-T l'HK.M When the men on ihe Bucknell campu.w get theu- annual break from the coeds on March 15, it would be a w^ise idea for the young ladies to bring their big night of the year up to date by ""drafting"" their dates instead of just invilljig them. The men are playing the part of the conscripted army anyway, .so why not let them feel at home by dafting them. At least this is one draft they won't try to dixlge. Each young coed should have a draft .slip which she could present to the man of her choice, and after he once receives it there should be enough strings attached that he Would be unable to slip the halter. At least lliis idea would put It on a modern footing, and tight in tune with the times. But no matter how they are inducted in to the service for the event the Bucknell male .population is all agog over a big evening. The part of the contract that calls for the young lady to pay the bill especially appeals to a great majority of the men. Many of them will make an all>out attempt to be as expensive as possible, ajvd"
we,do mean an all-out attempt change <lances <luring the course of the evening. That will be one of We understand that the young ladies have arranged for several ex- the greatest things that ever happened to Bucknell lads
and,"lasses alike. Stag line.s and cutting are imheard of at this institution and even exchanging dances witha fraternity brother is frowned upon. So we say more power to the coeds and their exchange dances. There l.w nf> lx>tter way for Bucknellians to meet Bucknellians, and that Is some- thing this camptus needs. the"

Thurs.,".Minneapolis, Minn.-- (ACIM-- It's a ^lontroversial world, and even the as- tronomers are having trouble agree- ing. Recently a University of California student came up with new figures to show that Ras Algethi, in thf con- stellation of Hercules, is the largest star in the heavens. The astronomy .sophomore. George"
H.,"Ilerbip;. said his figures upset the previous theory that the largest star was Ant a res, in the constellation Scorpio. Now. however, comes Prof. William .1. Luyten of the University of Min- nesota astronomy department, who Mys Herbig's figuies are not entirely 4!orrect. .Acually, he says, a much larger star is the binary ""supergiant"" 4.-ompanion to the star Epsilon Auri gae, discovered in ID.'ls. There was considerable (luestion for a time about whether the sup<Tgiant ""ghost"" actually was a star because it emits only dark, or infra-red, rays instead of the us\ial bright light. That is one rea.son the star e.scnped Attention for so long. Actually, Professor Luyten .-lays. this black giant has a diameter about .""!.0(K> times the .sun, which makes it about 27,000,000.000 times larger."
Then,"there is another ""eclipsing hinary""-- so-calU'd b^vause its peri- 4>>dic appearance in front of the known 5tar diminishes for a time the amount *if light thrown off -- believ<<><l to be more than <<>,00(>> times the sun's dia- meter. .Star obs<<'rvati<>>ns taken at diffei - . r.t times vary because of difficulties of obserx-ation rather than because of errors in calculation. rn)fo8.sor Luy- ten says. markets, thus crippling their econom- ic stability.

A,"poll taken from the Bucknell varsity play- t IS revealed their coice for an all-op- prnent team. In making the selection, the Bison players were of course omitted. How- ever, beyond a doubt, the Bucknell s<iuad contains several who rate vm high as those chosen from amon^ their adversaries."
The,"Bison ball-handlers support each other in saying that for speed ijnd shiftiness, George Haines and Fred Fahringer would compete with any of their opponents, and the back- board playing of Ed Glass would be hard to beat in any league. Upon commenting on the various outstanding qualities found in the op- position, several"
men,
drew,"special recognition. ""Stretch"" Trimmer, the boy who has proven to be the Bison jinx for the past two years, was men- tioned as the best under-pressure I'layer met this year. Fox and Wagner of Franklin and Marshall were noted for their defen- .'*:ve and offensive playing respective- ly. Wagner was also distinguished for his impressive ball handling.

The,"break-down, which occurred shortly after 3:00 a. ni., took place in one of the main turbines of the plant. Although, according to plant officials, 'not seriois"", the University will be I'.nable to generate its"
own,"power until the turbine has been repaired. .Meanyrhile, electricity will be pur- chased from the Citizen's Electric Company of I^ewisburg, local power company. It is not definitely known when the plant will be in operation again. It IS hoped by the ofTicial.^; that it will bo no longer than a few days at the 'rost; the ag^ent from the Westing- house Electric Company of New York arrived Tuesday afternoon to inves- tigate the accident.

THE,
SAME,
OLD,".STORY: (The story of the three b'>ars, revis- ed). Once upon a time there were three co-eds -- a great big co-e<l, a middle- *ized co-ed, and little bitty co-ed. They liver around a forest of tulips in the Women's Quadranglo, out in the Pennsylvania womis. They spent the <lay idly, thinking of new pranks t<>> play and new diversions to pursue; *ne bright afternoon they went bi- cycling, out to the big Red Rock, where they decide<l to stop and have the picnic lunch they ha<l packed for the purpose. Joe Doaks was a freshman. He was no smooth applf; he was a plain, ordinary, naive fellow with a crush on Abigail, the girl he had left be- hind in pursuit of things more intel- lectual-Iess inspiring, buj more intel- lectual. Joe wasn't anything excep- tional; he wasn't shy and he wasn't conceited; to all who knew him he was just plain big-hearted Joe Doaks. It was Spring (you could tell by"
|,the smell of the ftdorless marigolds
*n,"the campus). Joe sanntered' through the forest of tulips, across the quadrangle, and .swunjc into Har- | doe's. .Seeing no one there, he pro- ' fc-eded to investigate the workings of a pin-ball machine and to play ""Floise"" on the jute-box. When who Rhould appear but the three co-eds, #wturning from the Rock. The picnic had taken them away from Hardoe's for an hour or two (they didn't own the place, but they practically ran it; they were there most of the time, and Saul Hardoe, the owner,"
had,"left them the placp in his will). Joe ducked. Joe ducked, but too late. They asketl him to sit down, make him.self at home. He did. ( Wa.^ this right?, thought Joe; b<'tter not, he told himself. Joe was a pledge at the Kho Dammit Rho fraternity; bet- ter call the Interfratemity Council end .ser if this was becoming of .i pledge). .Toe sat down, tasted one coca-cola, but it had too much lemon in it, and he choked. ""Too much lemon"", he ga.sped. He tried the necond, but that didn't have enough lemon. The third was just a plain coke, so he gulped it down. Joe was beginning to"
fed,"high row (who said he wasn't naive?). Gathering up all his resourcefulness, he summoned the courage to s<<y, ""Wanna dance?"". The first dance was terrible: Joe couldn't dance with that big co-ed; the .second dance was worse; the little co-ed stepped all over hi.- feet. But the middle-sized co-ed was just right, so they danced all afternoon. By this time our friend (Joe) wa.< exhausted; he would say <<)r do any- thing to get hack in the fellows, the fraternity house, and dinner; so h.- gave his pledge-pin to the middle- nhctl co-ed, and ran like a deer down fratemity row until he reacheil the fire-place and .supper. Th.-it night Joe wrote Abigail. He #wrote a letter that begged forgive- msii in every line, even between the lines. He bad sported with a co-ed; how could he ever explain? Having written his explanation, he Tan line a deer (.loe still runs like a deer) <iown to the train to mail the letter. Dejected. Joe slipped and fell in front of the Williamsporter.

Between the present date and .April 3, the end of the season, there are four interesting debates to  be held in tne Lit lounge.

young,

standing,
beside,a

Poland,
when,a
boy,no
older,
than,"he,"
and,dressed in a
few,
ragged,
remnants,of
what,
had,once
been,"a uni- form, staggered up to the"
newsman,
and,fell
down,
upon,the
ground,to
rest.,
As,"he lay, he told the"
American,his
story.,
He,
had,
been,a
student,in a university
when,
war,
had,
struck.,
With,his
class-mates,he
had,
been,called to

country.,
Now,that

were,
being,
tortured,
by,all the
hcnious,
devices,
which,
could,be
devised,
by,the devilish
mind,
of,
power-drunk,
tyrants.,
The,
American's,eyes fell

feet.,
They,
were,
cracked,
and,
bloody,
from,miles of
walking,over frozen
ruts.,

probably,safe to say that no one in the

which,will

empty,the

pockets,to be
shipped,
away,to bible-
pounders,on
some,foreign strand
whose,
avowed,
purpose,is to
bring,Christianity to a
handful,of
head-hunters.,
But,the great
majority,of us
construe,every
humanitarian,
attempt,to give
ma-,terial and practical aid to suffering peoples of our
own,rank
and,station in life as a
"""missionary",
"movement"",",
and,
hence,excuse ourselves
from,participating.
The,Polish
boy,
without,shoes
who,
whimpered,until he
met,a
man,
without,feet is only one of the million or
more,college stu- dents who are either
wandering,
along,deserted roads in the war-
raped,countries of
Europe,"and Asia, or are starving and freezing in"
concentration,
camps,
where,
they,
have,
been,
herded,

may,be
shocking,to
American,

proven,that the
young,
men,and

and,Asia
today,"feel pain just as acutely,"
hunger,"just as severely,"
and,cold just as
sharply,as those of us

agreements,"so ""airtight"" that"

This,drive to solicit aid for

from,the effect of

by,a na- tionwide group
which,calls itself the
"""World",

THE,500

In West College, West Wing, Old Main, Kast Wing, F.ast College and in many of the fra- ternity houses, they'll bury their head in a book of organic chemistry, or cry in their cokes at the ""Rec Room"". Once every year they have a chance to forsake their books and see the bright lights at the expense of Bucknell's coeds. But alas and alack, there are only 400 coeds to take care of 900 men, .so .some pour guy will have to sit at home. Not because he is a social outcast, not because he isn't a"
"BMOC,","(there are times when we wonder about that last one), but becau.se Bucknell has a shortage of women. Those fellows who, mathematictlly, don't have a chance to attend Coed Night are looking forward to March 28, you know,-- Senior Ball. That's the weekend every available Bucknell male will be in great de- mand. Strange, isn't it"
?,"We wonder how many of our coed.s would sit at home on March 28 if these 500 men set-apart imported dates for the Senior Ball. .N'asty thought, isn't it? But wouldn't they have a verj' good reason for such a procedure? It .seems that in one of the men's dorms the boys have formed a union that compels every man in the group, who gets a bid to Coed Night, to demand that his date also take one of his best friends. If the young lady says, ""No"", then the young man mu.st decline her invitation. It may smack of"
CIO.,"but they tell me it has its points. During a workout in the gym this week, your colunmist hoard a group of the boys who have received bids to the big event by Bucknell coeds, di.scussing the matter. It was tjuite apparent that the boys noticed how the majority of affairs sponsored by the coeds coincided with, or just preceded Bucknell's Junior Prom, Senior Ball, and hou.se parties. One fraternity man's comment was simply, ""Quite convenient"". Ain't it the truth. But all this talk doesn't take care of Bucknell's 500 forgotten men. Are Bucknell's coeds going to force them to find entertainment some place other than the Bucknell campus on Saturday night? Will the ma- jority of these fellows, who are being left alone during Coe<l Night, re- taliate on March 28 by importing tJiat little brunette from"
home?,"It certainly sounds logical. It's your problem coeds. What are you going to do with these ,500 deser\-ing males? Or don't you think it is a problem? .Are you going to include the forgotten men in your gala evening, or drive them off the campus for that night. To the first coed who dates two young men for that particular even- ing, this columnist and the ""Bucknellian"" will send one dozen ro.ses."

STUDENT,
CREDIT,"The poor we always have with us, and when we will, we may give them credit. Loan sharks, pawn brokei-s, and personal tinance com- I>anies with their Incessant advertising attract our attentions to this wide-spread need. .Social legislation has helped a lot and costs a lot as the business man today is continually confronted with a multiplicity of poor taxes. Trust in the I>>rd with a little cooperation on our part is obsolete. Today the relief office i.s our shepherd. We shall not want, because the government owes us a living. The college student, like the rest of u.s, sometimes finds himself financially embarrassed. His check, may have been delayed, his al- lowance cut, or an important social occasion has overdrawn his re- sources. Whatever the cause, he needs a friend. We can't condemn him if he has lived beyond his income, for there are a lot of sinners in that classification. We just insist that these bad habits do not at- tain a chronic stage. Rather than see any Bucknell .student go hun- gry, we prefer to extend a little credit. We can't afford it. but we do it"
anyway.,"Wliile it ties up, considerably, our working capital, our ultimate losses are small. The only certain losses are the rare stu- dents who drink to excess, those who acquire membership on the Dean's list for an early departure. If you want to know all the dead- beats at Bucknell just recall the drunks you know. We never saw one yet that wasn't a liar and a cheat. If booze has busted you, we are not interested. After all we are extending legitimate credit and not dispensing relief. We refer you to the nearest pawnshop. They've got your number. The College Inn extends to you credit worthy of your manhowl and expects you to come clean and pay your debts, of your own voli- tion. We haven't the time nor the clerical force to send out bills. We never annoy the Administration with our petty accounts, and it's a rare parent that ever hears of them. Your cooperation will allow u.s to help other needy 8tudent.s -- and you would be Buri)rised to know how great that need is at times."

A,"course in which students choose their own teachers, select their own topics for study, and receive no col- lege credit for their work is proving cne of the most popular ever under- taken by Bucknell University stu- dents. The name of the course: ""Courtship and Marriage"". Although this subject is not listed in the college catalogue, more than 40 students are finding it of sufl^cient interest to meet for several hours each week to engage in informal di>>- tuiJsion of the topic under the direc- tun of a faculty adviser. Attend- ance is wholly voluntary, and the problem has been how to keep down rather than increase enrollment. Organized by a group of nine stu- dents who decided that they would be intere.sted in hearing the opinions of their fellow students on the all im- portant topic of courtship and matri- mony, the class has already consider- ed .such pertinent .subject.s as: ""how do you know when you are in love?"", ""to what extent should family back- ground influence the choice of a mate?"", and ""do college people have n^ore chance at success in marriage?"" Faculty members are cooperating in the project, but the choice of topics and of .speakers is entirely up to the students. At a recent meeting they heard Dr. Alvin Biscoe of the eco- nomics department in a discussion of the economic factors of matrimony. ""Should"
women,"work after mar- riage?"" and ""how much money does a couple need tu get married?"" were among the question.s considered under hi.s direction. Dr. John"
W.,"Rice, professor of bac- teriology, is scheduled to appear be- fore the class soon to discu.ss ""Health -- Before and After Marriage"", and Dr. .Meyer"
F.,"Nimkoff, ])rofessor of .sociology, will discuss ""Marital Ad- justments"" at another meeting. Because so many students express- ^'(\ a de-sire to attend the class, en- rollment has been limited for the present to juniors and seniors."

I,"am pleased to know that the students of Bucknell are interested in the World Student Service Fund and that you are plan- nmg to have a share in this worthy movement. The condition of students in the war torn countries of the world is tragic in the extreme.

FAULTS,"by Jeanne Rockwell Tonjffht and tomorrow nij?ht Buck- nell theatre-goers will have the privi- lege of attending the Bernard Shaw classic ""Saint Joan""' as prt'sented by Cap and Daprprer in the Lewisburg high school auditorium. Yesterday this reviewer saw the matinee and if it can be taken as a criterion the eve- ning shows will be excellent. Con- sidered as a whole the play has  been given fine treatment, and Lyn Swann in beautiful and moving in the lead- ing role. ""Saint Joan"" in almost every re- Bppct triumphs over the drawbacks of a small seage. The scenery is some- thing to feast the eyes on, especially that of the cathedral and the trial room. The stained glass windows in particular are notable. TTie only set whfch did not seem quite up to .stan- dard is that by the river bank. Swann is Outstanding Mis.s Swanns' central role of Joan in well taken. Her portrayal of the irreat martyr as an innocent, simple. and inspired country girl is most con- vincing.    She uses her obvious knowl- edge of the theatre to good advant- age.      The emotional .<!cenes arc, of course, the best, especially those in the cathedral and in the trial scene. For smoothness and pace the opening act stands out. Miss Swann's lines at matinee, however, show faulty memorization which may be due to nervousnosp or lack of sufficient re- hearsal. The part of the Dauphin as por- traved by Bob Scharmann is com mendable. He carries ably even* scene in which he appears. Unfor- tunately the Dauphin's scene .stealing is detrimental to his own role. Supporting Casf Fine The support inr: cast also does a 1 flne job. Although he has only the (Continued on page 8.)"

Besides his great aggregation, Dorsey personally is acclaimed by critics and musicians alike as one of the greatest, if not the top trombon- ist of all time. Special recognition of the fact that he is one uf the greatest trombon- ist of all time, exists in the fact  that Tommy is honorary president of tho ""hot"" clubs and bands at the University of Florida. Oberlin, Drake, Notre Dame, Butler, Buffalo, and the Universities of Alabama. Pittsburgh, and Vir- sinia. as well as others. He has made a speciality of recording old dance tunes and returning t};em to the realm of real hits. His recording of ""Mario"" is a perfect ex- ample of this technique. This recording .still remains his best and mo.st popular of all his waxings. The ever popular ""V. ho"" is another good ex- ample of what he has done by recoixling old numbers.

The writer of it is a business woman, a British sub- ject who when in her teens, went through the first World War.) 64 Taylor Lane, Denton, Manchester, England, February (ith, 1941. Dear Jeanne: quite My letter is very late for Christmas this year, but we are living in such active times you will have to excuse me. Hope you all had a Merry Christ- mas and the usual parties. Ours was very quiet, we had no sirens for a day or two. However, we had a terrible raid just before Christmas, and a lot of 'damage has been done in Manchester. We missed it but it is frightful to sit in the hou.se and hear the planes, (I believe about 400) going over, guns , firing, and bombs dropping and whistling past the house. You feel so help-"
I,"less, and you just wonder if the next will be on you. The town next to ua has had quite a few killed .and much property damaged. As it is about eight ^ miles from Manchester and we are only five, we consider ourselves ucky. It is surprising what you can get used to. The stores had their Januar>' sales a.s usual. The theatres are opening in the mornings and afternoon so as to give you time to get home before thj blackout and sirens.

SPEAKS:,(On the scientific front in some of our larger institutions). AIX-AMEUICAN-1941: Galileo Jones of .Swante College (in the deep South) has an idea that should revolutionize the bottling in- dustry; he has a new process for m.'inufacturing bottle-necks. Origin- nlly conceiving the idea
from,"the newspapers, by the new process"
G.,J. is going to specialize in creating all sizes and shapes of bottle-necks (got his first big order from the govern- ment) and wrapping them with all kinds of strings and red tape.
THEY,
SAID,
HE,
WAS,"MAU: Some young fellow down at Potts- town Tech who has been following DiiPont's latest developments has a new field for synthetic production. While DuP has been making every- thing from women's cosmetics to babies foods out of such raw products as coal and water, our young friend has bought"
a,"cotton plantation in Georgia and is experimenting in the bathtub with a new product he calls ""cotton gin""."
AND,
I'SEFUL,"TOO: Two Physics majors have perfected a new fluoro.<<cope in their laboratories at Sadd State that has almost in- credible X-ray powers. It is the only instrument ever devise<l that can see through a woman's mind. mv,"
COMPLEX:,"Students at a large Northern uni- versity have been improving a sample sent in from -Aroostook, Maine, which they think might develop into a gen- uinely odorles.s potato. Purpose: To deceive potato-bugs into thinking that's not a potato they're chewing on; it's a marigrold."

FIRST,
AND,
FOREMOST:,"To get to things of a more timely nature, this week Bucknell will elect Senior (female) students for queen of the ""great big Senior Ball"" next Friday night. ,\ queen a month is our motto here; if"
Tommy,"Dorsey frets here bcfttre 10:30 he will crown thf real (jueen of the Ball. What looks odd is if a total of 1S23 votes comes in from a body of 1322 students. Of course, stuffing the ballot-box is an unheard of thing around here. Down at Alabama once a girl was voted the most popular C'>-e<l on the"
campns.,It was dis- covered later she hadn't had a date :n three-and-a-half years; just goes to show what stuffing the ballot can do.

Review,"by Bob Lambert Three of the latest Decca album Bets are of unusual interest. Two of them are anthologies, album 182 in- cluding the best colored jazz recordiKl en the Decca label since 1M4, and rlbiim IS? featuring the b^rt white jazz waxed during the same period. The choice is intelligent and varied, and almost .'til of the big names in swing are npre.sented. Dave Dex- ter's notes accompanying the albums are well wirtten and tell what to lis- ten for on each .side. The other al- bum is a collection of the be.st Jim- mie Lunceford recordings on Decca. The ten sides include such master- pieces a.T Margie. Coquette, Posin' and Four Or Fhc Times and cover the period bf>twppn li'35 and 1938."

That is why everyone owes it to himself, if he is la know the intricacies involved, to obtain if possible, employment in some branch of retail selling. If he 'does this he will be able to look at things not only from the cu.stomer's side, but from the .seller'.s as well. Having taken my own advice, and spent a few all-too-short months in a men's retail dothing store. 1 feel a Lit qualifiiKi to explain some of the ins and outs of this none-too-charm- ing business, and t<> clarify some of the things which, as a consumer, puz- zle<l me -- and as"
I,"am a member of the great middle class buying public, may be problems to other consumers, lorthwith,"
I,"shall try to elucidate a few items, which although they are nf minor consequence, sometimes cau.se furrows of cart to be raised upon the brows of Mr. and Mrs. John"
Q.,"Public. Salesmen Have Orderly I'rocedure When you shyly slink into a .store for jither buying or looking pur- poses, it isn't mere chance that sends a salesman over to take care of you, nor is it the fact that he just hap- pened to be the first of a group of I sales hungry wolves to sight you. .This could be the ca.se in some ill- I managed e.<<tabli.shment, but in most 'shops there is a definitf orderly pro- icedare for taking care of this impor- tant detail. I The sales personnel are on what is known in the trade as ""call"". This means that instead of working hap- hazardly,    and causing ill feeling among themselves by trying to steal customers frrtm one another, they 'agree upon a certain order. For ex- ample: the salesman having first call j takes the first customer, the one  hav- iing second call take.<>> the second cus- t<>mer. and so on <lown the line until the last salesman has been reached. ,Then the same routine starts all over again. If through no fault of his own a ralesman mis.ses his call he will prob- 'ably change calls with the next in .line so as not fo lose a .sale. If how- ^ever, he mis.ses a call through not being on his toes he will have to wait u'ltil his next turn, as the re.st of  the men will not be in sympathy with him. This system holds true only wher the salesmen are on commission, and works wonders"
in,"preventing the 'hungry"" type from trying to take core of two or three customers at a t'me, and knifing in the back his les.s aggressive, or humane, brothers. Become Obnoxious Characters .A salesman on commission in a re- t.iil e.stablishment is one of the least favored of mother earth's children, and an object to be pitied rather than scorned. Whether or not he makes a decent living depends entirely upon what, and how he .sells. He is usual- ly the objectionable type of high pres- sure man -- the one who tries to sell you everything within sight, and the more you protest the more glib and persuasive he becomes. He is. gentle reader, as"
I,"found through experi- ence, literally forced to become an 'obnoxious character, the butt of ridi- Jcule, and one of the favorite subjects of comic cartoonists, by the henious commission system under which he labors. I The system u.sually nms in this fashion. Say there are four depart- n'ents in the store: clothing, shofs. I hats, and hal)erdashery. The sales- I"

LEWISBURG,"""Low Prices Every Day"" man gets a commission on whatever he sells in his own department, plus u percentage on the commission of a Falesman in any other department to v.hich he recommends a customer -- if that customer makes a purchase in that department. That i.s why you, as a customer, are fair"
game,"the minute you step into a store, and why the ""blitzkrieg"" approach, and the goblins will get you if you don't watch out. Expertfs in Battle of Wits There's an old saying ""Beware of Greeks bearing gifts"". This may e;isily be niodemized into ""Beware of .salesmen bearing gifts"". You may think you're getting a bargain but most likely you're not. Just remem- ber you're up against an expert in the battle of wits and he's not going to give you anything for nothing. If a salesman seems over anxious to sell you one object in preference to another, most likely it means that he derives a higlier commi-ssion from that object. Of course the higher the price the higher the commis-sion but also higher commi.ssions are given nn things that the shop is try- ing to get rid of, such as clothing that is no longer in styl*>>, or the pro- \erbial Christmas necktie. Many Tricks of the Trade I When purchasing something always lli'ok at the tag. Notice the price and the size. There are many tricks of the trade. When trying on .suits the Isalesman may try a wrong size suit jon you if it happens to be a low com- Irission suit. The next suit will of jcoiirne be a high commission one but I in the correct size. This suit looks I so much b*>>tter than the first one that many men will assume that because of its higher price it is cut better and vill invariably purchase it. Sometimes the suit you want will Tot be available in your size. Fac- ing  the loss of a sale the 'talesman vill probably tell you that you'd look iiuch better in something else. Never vill he tell you that he ha.sn't what- 'ver it is that you desire. .Nine times out of ten you'll walk out of the store with something you didn't want in he first place but nevertheless exalt- ng the praises of your pal. the .sales- Continued on Page 8.)"

SWANN,
SONG,"During the past three yean we have watched Cap and Dagger strug- gle through quite a few prodnetioiia and we arc convinced that they know what they are doing. StaAent dfarcctors, production managers, cos- tume designers, make-up artists, and scenery designers, have turned in remarkable work on some really tough productions. Student directors have worked with a number of fine actors and actresses, during this time, who were imports from the footlights of broadwa^, and some who were still doing little theater work. In any event there has always been complete harmony between the production staff and the guest star. But about **St. Joan"" we aren't so sure. During the past several nights and yesterday afternoon at the mati- nee performance, we had the privilege of watching Cap and Dagger re- hearse their latest production, and all did not seem to run with perfec- tion. Our guest artist attempted to take too much of the responsibility of the production upon her own shoulders. She directed make-up. scen- ery, lighting, costuming, and script, which is quite a load to carry, even for a St. Joan. We grant the young lady knows, or at least should know. a great deal about the problems connected with producing a play. But perhaps a little more tact in passing this information along woull be great help to the entire cast. Students have a certain amount of pride, that's not unosoaL .\nd rightly they should. Some of the pei>ple connected with the production of St. Joan have been working with Cap and Dagger for the past four years. They to know something about producing a play. They have shown their ability in such hits as ""High Tor"", ""Night Must Fall"", ""Rope"" and many others. Bucknellians have granted the fact that Cap and Daggerites know their drama. It may be that it is for just that rea- son they resent a guest star, who didn't know her lines for the first pub- lic performance of the play yesterday, telling them what to do. Afc'hen the star of any performance loses the continuity of his or  her part nme times during the course of a performance, and climaxes the perfom^ance by forgetting several lines entirely at one spot in the last act, there is definitely something wnjng. Especially when the perform- er has played the identical part before and has r^Maraed it for the better part of two weeks. When the supporting cast of more than 20 players has a combined error average of 2, then the star's performance looks even more ragged. Perhaps our star will do better tonight and tomor- row night. We hope so. Her ease, grace, and acting ability were sacri- ficed in the matinee performance because she lost the continuity of her lines. To top off the afternoon performance. Bob Schannann stole the show from the star. Well grant that 'nis lines gave him a world of opportun- ity, but surely MiM Svaan's ability should have made her performance far more outstawBiif. When Scharmann appeared on the stage every- one forgot about Miss"
Swann.,"With a silly expression, clever lines, ability, and a sugar stick, vScharmann stole scenes ri|^t and left. With- out him ""St. Joan"" would be just another play, but with him it turns out to be something you will remember. We will admit that in several of the scenes he carries his part of the slightly fe<<Ma danphin to extremes, but nevertheless he gets our vote for the best performance. To Bob Lambert and Miss Tbomaa. who were responsible for the by Walton"
Cloke,", . ,"
",,^","n special effects and the sound, we offer a few orchids. They were really very good. The bell sequence in the cathedral is especially fine and adds a great deal to the entire scene. Robert Borchers also shows that he has ability in the cathedral scene with Miss Swann. His voice is exception- ally good and his manner casual and easy. We realize that Cap and Dagger was playing to a ""hard to pkaae audience"" on Wednesday afternoon. They showed very little appreciation for the many things an adult audience will applaud in both the evening performances. But without a doubt Cap and Dagger could not find a more critical audience than the one attending the matinee performance. They noticed everything that might give the performance an unauthentic touch. Failure to remember lines was an unexcusable error as far as they were concerned, and we back them up on that point. As a whole ""St. Joan"" is well directed and the added lighting, cos- tuming, etc.. are very good. It is a credit to George Egan, who incident- ally plays his role to perfection as he has done in so many productions, in tike paat. But here's hoping that Cap and Dagger's"
STAR,shines for the laafe two performances.

DANCIL,"This little item is for the men on the Bucknell campus, but as long m you coeds have read this far yon might as well read the rest. Dont get cxdtad over the new title that has been tacked on to the annual Baeknell Senior Ball. We know that it is quite suggestive, but you dont have to send your date orchids. We have visions of an empty ^aca floor if that idea were put into practice. It seems that the Senior Bait Ojmmittee wanted a theme for their annual dance and the idea of orchids as the theme seemed very appealing.. To say the least their taste is quite expensive. But don't worry fellows, orchids at the Senior Ball will be confined to paper likenesses, with the exception of those adorning the Queen. But Lf you have the necessary financial remuneration for such botanical eptfi^f. then by all means give  your date a break. But we don't think A>> will refuse to go to the Ball if you don't come across with orchida."

Incident- ally, this orchestra went over big when they played for a dance at .State not many weekends ago. The gym was decorated with, ol course, the colors of the eleven fra- temities on campus, as theme. Ban- ners of the various organizations were hung on the walls, and below each were comfortable chairs and set- tees belonging to the particular house.

FACULTY,
FLEETFOOTS.,_... Not to be outclassed
by,"their juniors, a representative group of male faculty members have been irathering in Davis gymnasium one evening a week for the past several months to demonstrate their athletic prowess and to recondition their phy- sical frames for competition against intramural winners on the campus. Conceived by Bus Blum, the idea of forming faculty teams is grrowing in popularity among the professors and administration members. Before April rolls around, gym-master Blum expects to have a volleyball team and a handball team to pit against the fitudent teams. Paul Hightower is the star of the volleyball team. Blum says that Paul performs well near the net and is val- aable in setting up plays on the of- fensive. Hightower's team scrim- maged with a volleyball team headed by Harold Hayden on Tuesday night with the former aggregation emerg- ing victorious. Dean Ralph"
E.,"Page had a small audience during his performance with the Hightower Holdo.ers. Tho Dean's two youngsters sat in the stands and watche<l thoir daddy help his team to a sweeping victory. The Hayden team, it is understood, is anxious to nab Dean Pago, who at present is not Batisfied with the position .Manager Hightower has given"
him,
on,the team.
The,"Haydenitos were somewhat handicapped against their opponents when Professor MacCreadie vanished before game-time. .Someone walked off with tho profes.sor's gym suit, it was explained later. Prof. Gathings. who usually holds forth in badminton, substituted for Prof. .MacCreadie. No member of the faculty or ad- ministration has been able to defeat Prof. Stetkewic-^,"
the,recogrnized champion at handball. He comment- ed this week that ho would like to face some athlete who will give him a workout. Dr. Ballentine'g natural tennis- playing ability gives
him,
an,"edge <>>ver tho f.triilty colleagues in the badminton realm of sports. He has tutored Dr. Gathiny^s along the road towards being an .A-1 performer at this game. Dr. Bond, tho most versatile of the ! athlotic proup, is rounding up a vol- leyball team to oppo.se the Hightower forces. After watching the work of Dr. Sauv.iin. Piof. Wooden. Prof, riinsch. Prof. Bruce Miller, and Prof. William Miller, Dr. Bond believes he has a combine that can .swamp Paul's team. Coach Hightower relies for effec- tive serving on"
Dean,"Shimer, who bounces the hall into the opponents rourt with bullet-like speed. Dr. Ir- land is another steady player for the Hightower aggregation. Director Blum has also arranged training rulo.s for the players. From reliable sources it is hinted that Bus has advised the faculty players again.st the loss of sleep. One remedy for that would be for the profs to doze through 8 o'clocks. (Oh, yeah!) stage plays which were produced dur- ing his high .school career. It's difficult to understand how those hustling athletes can sit peace- fully through a hand of bridge."
A,check reveals it's the average Buck- nell athlete's favorite diversion. (We wonder if a lad named Blum had a hand in that deal)

OPFN,
HOUSE.,"If seeing is believing, then the crowd at la.st Saturday's Greek Open House, held in Tustin Gymnasium, is a positive sign that next year Buck- nell's fraternities can plan for their first real Intei fraternity Ball. Prov- ing to bt- a suteess far beyond the wildest dreams of Bucknell Greeks, the ""open-house"" really packed them in and the ""Bucknellians"" did thorn selves proud with an array of swing versions that were fashioned to please the severest of swing critics. The committee, handling the fii-st attempt at an interfrateniity so- cial get-together, i.s to be complimented upon the success it achieved. To each fraternity on the campus should go tVie plaudits of the commit- tee, for the splendid coop<'ration the individual houses gave the central committee heads. To make possible the arrangements for a separate al- cove for each Greek society represented on the campus, the central com- mittee had to turn to the individual hou.ses for furniture. In this respect the fraternity men did themsolve.s proud by contributing enougii funii- ture to seat a standing aniiy, or at least make it comfortable for ""open house"" first-nighters. This affair should truly prove to be a flying wedge to greater thing.s next year. There has long been a need for a social affair spon.sored by the united social fraternities on the Bucknell campus. Something that could really be cla.ssod with the"
I-F,"Balls of sister schools and the tradi- tional Ivy Ball that is the pride of Pennsylvania. Next year Bucknell should be able to make its fir.st play for recognition in this field. Prom now on the I-F Ball should mean as much to Bucknellians as Junior Prom or Senior Ball, for the experiment has resulted in exceptional success. --"

HOW,"Many have  been the nights that we have tilted this chair back, cock- ed our feet on the desk amid scattered copy, and talkwl with fellow jour- nalists about the prospects or possibilities for"
a,Varsity Show on the Bucknell
campus.,"We can still hear Hal Kierce, as he sat at the desk across from us, bemoaning the fact that Bucknell wa.s up to its neck in talent that was being utterly wasted without a Varsity Show to give it a break. During the recent Post-Ejcam Jubilee, we .sat in the stands in Da>'is"
Gym,"and saw just exactly what Hal had seen for four years. It's a fact. Bucknell is up to its neck in talent, and it's the kind of talent that could produce a Varsity Show for Bucknell University that would be the envy of universities throughout the land, and at last we aix* going to do some- thing about it. On April 24, the Bucknell ""B"" Club will present the first Bucknell Varsity Show in the Ix^wisburg High School, under the direction of Paul Hightower. To make it something that will really remain traditional on the camj)us, we hope that all the parts are reser\-ed for"
men.,This should be a no woman
show.,WlTl even suggest a motto that will aid in making the affair purely
masculine.,"""All our chorines are men, but every one is a perfect lady"". This leaves no room for the fair sex. For the want of a better name we will call them in our stories, ""The Varsity Players"". From what we understand about the situation the show will attempt to present entertainment that is bright, fast moving, with plenty of color, and nothing that smacks of heavy drama. This is what Bucknell students want, and the Varsity Players can give it to them. Composed of a series of events not unusual to the old time mitistrel show.s, and bolstered by the use of choruses of chorines, portrayed by beefy football stars with catchy rythms furnished by student composers and arranged by the faculty of the Bucknell School of Music, the show will not be for the sophisticated. In fact to prove its worth ii must be full of what Dr.s. term ""belly-laughs"". This seems to be the year of innovations, and from all indications this proposed Varsity Show should prove to be such a succe.ss that it will become a tradition at Bucknell. To make it that success this column and the Bucknellian pledge their v.hole-hearted support with only one regret, the man who used to write ""Strictly Confidential"" will not be on the campus to see something he visioned through four years of college."

Tommy,"Dor- scy. This will be the first time that the Senior Ball has ever had a touch of regal pomp and ceremony, and it will undoubtedly be an added touch of festivity to an already gala occasion. We saw the votes counted and there was not any doubt in the minds of the judges who won the contest. The count was overwhelming for a certain young lady who as yet doesn't know that .she will wield regal power over Bucknell socialites for one"
evening.,But you can take my word for it she's a real credit to the present senior class. l*M***tl*M<<IMI<<<<>>>>*t<<l #*<<*** #****(*! ********#< ll<<*llttl**ltll<<t I

Scenes of the picture are taken in ihe restortni Capitol, the Governor's Palace, the Raleigh Tavern, and in ihe homes and street.s of the revived Colonial town. Hated as one of the outstanding I>'ctures of the year, ""The Howards of Virginia"" is playing currently at ur- ban theatres all over the United States.

Because a player is droppecj from the ranks does not mean that he can't play baseball, but that an- other player has a fielding and bat- ting ability that is superior to his. Many persons think that practice has begun early this year. It must be taken into account that weather conditions can hamper the practice <<eBsions and drive the players in- doors. Also a lO-day recess of spring vacation cuts down the number of days which is neede<l to whip the te^m into shape. Four days after the recess, the first encounter of the diamond battles takes place at home with Sus<]uehanna University. April 18th. Cooperstown threr he slammed out a 1 rodigious home run.

Today,"by Buzzie Smeltzer The varsity football squad is .sched- uled to take to the field no later than today it was announced by Coach Al Humphreys. Up to the present time the workouts in the gym have been concentrating primarily on shifts and timing. ""The spirit that was evident in last year's team is carrying over to thl<< year's squad"", said the coach. ""The boys are working hanl, and even though the squad looks small in num- bers it ifi large in effort and enthus- iasm. If the students would give ub more support aS far as spirit goes the future would look much brighter than it does"". The prospect of a few early scrimmages this spring has also adde<l pep and vim to the team. Next year's offense will be built nround certain new rules concerning passing, .substitution, and ball-hand- ling behind the line of scrimmage. Because of good backs and passers the new passing rule will be taken advantage of. This rule allows the ball on an incomplete fourth down pass over the goal line to be returned to the point of the preceding down instead of the twenty- vard line as wan previously the case. This will facili- another contestant is ^ate more passing, especially near the. eliminated. In the third round, Bie- i^oal"

Life,"vacation. All those from last year's squad that want to be considered for cheerleading next year must report to these spring practices as the squad will be cho.sen this .spring. I^oyalty at these practices will mean a lot in the determination ot fhe .selections. During the past year it seems that gi'rls have been discouraged from .""#eeking positions on the cheerleading I squad. The few time.'? that we hav- had girls lead cheers, they were vig- iorou.sly supporte<i by the student I body. The students seem to be whol. ly in favor of girl cheerleaders and we are wondering why they are not I encouraged to compete for positions ' on the squad. by Boh Lamliert The consensus on the campus ii that Tommy Dorsey is just about the best band we could have gotten for tne Senior Ball. As a dance band, this outfit has had no equal since the denoument of the old Ray Noble out- fit. Four outstanding characteristics are responsible for Tommy's popular- i ity and quality. The first is arrangements. The chief arranger is Sy Oliver, formerly with Jimmie Lunceford, and for ex- amples of his superb work listen to Swanee River; The One"
I,"Love; .*^w!n)j Time Up In Harlem, and many other new ones. The second feature that puts Dor- sey where he is today is the musical Cjuality of parts of the band. The rhythm is bv far the finest section, even without the customary -jitar. I isten to .Sailing .At Midnight ; .Sym- phony In Riffs, and You Must Have I5efn"
A,"Beautiful Baby for proof. Third come the vocalists. The Pied Pipers, Frank Sinatra, and Connie Haines are utilized to full advantage as is evidenced in numbers like Oh, I^ok At Me Now; You Might Have Belonifcd To .\nother, and ri! Nerer Smile .Again. The personality of the band as a unit is the fourth feature and it's noticeable even while the men are set- ting up their .stands."
Tommy,"has a wonderful sense of humor, and it in- fects both the band and the audience. Naturally the outfit has faults. As a strictly hot band it has many su- periors. This, because although Tom- my plays the greatest sweet trombone in the world, musicians agree that he does not play such good hot trombone. There is a lack of good solo men in the sax .section although as a unit they blend well. The brass has Ziggy Elman for the hot solos, but as a unit they're the weakest section. But Dorsey is coming her<< as a dance orchestra, and as such, he'll be terrific. Decca's new album of ""Harlem Seen Through Calypso Eyea"" (No. 198) is interesting and amusing. The out- standing Calypso singer, Wilmoth Iloudini sings on all six sides, and composed all the numbers himself. If you've never heard Calypso music go out of your way to do so, and if you have heard it, and like it, you'll find this album well worth the price."

A,little learning is a dangerous
J,"thing and coupled with petty prejudices and superstitions, it n-adily . develops into a murderous complex. It didn't begin or end in the fir.st century and anyone who tries to explain away or defend the dirt v work of his own church, in substance, is approving that foul chapter in its history- and proclaiming himself as a member of a murder ring, bom out of due season. But whom the Lord loves he rebukes and chastens and w-e personally regard it as a fine precedent.

But despite all the skepticism of our day, regardless of our real- ists and unbelievers, the more substantial professions are con.stantly bowing and saying ""Robboni"", where dwellest thou, and what is  the solution of mir problems. The pedagogue can never find better meth- ods of teaching than those of the Christ. The psychiatrists and nhv- Ficians are returning to religion for their be.st wisdom, and even theo- logians are finding their Ixird again."

Honors,"by Dick CasHoff With but five days of practice re- maininK before the Easter vacation, the Bison baseballers are now goinj? through their paces with the spiiit and joRtle characteriKtic of Bucknell athletes. As the baseballers drill un- der the watchful eye of mentor ,Iohn Sitarsky, their finer .jualities are coming to light. In fact, Johnny has a fairly accurate estimate of his ma- terial and is prepared to issue a ten- tative starting lineup for the Bi-son's opener again.st Susquehanna's Cru- paders from .Selinsgrove. The probable lineup will tind Phil Stamm on the mound with Forrest Chilton behind the plate. Holding down first ba.se will be Harry Rey- nolds, a veteran of past encounters, and Will Ronk will be at the key- atone sack. Filling out the double play combination at short.stop will be the veteran Harry- Doenges, another of the few veterans remaining from Inst season's starters. Rounding out the infield at the hot comer will be"
I,"Bob Keegan. The Rochester lad, who displayed his talents on the freshman l basketball squad, is highly touted as"
|,a future star on the Bucknell dia-
I,"mond. The outfield will consist of ! ""Nipper"" Nolan in left, John Kuschel in right, and .Stan Schilder in center. ', The ""Nipper"" who is finishing hi^ ' athletic days at Bucknell is the only"
j,"outfield starter remaining from the ; '40 sqaud. The mound staff will be Tpounded out with Fay Hillings and i Stan Baer. Of the nine men, threp ere freshmen of fro.sh basketball ex- perience.    TTiey include Stamm, Kee- f^an, and Schilder. Harry Doenges vnU probably hold down the captaincy but this rumor most likely will not be confirmed until r.ext week, when a definite announce- ment declaring Joe Buzas' successor will be announced. Coach Sitarsky is pessimistic con- cerning the team's chances, and re- fuses to make any definite comment An the team's possibilities."

Strong,"The shouting has ceased, and no longer are the necks of the specta- tors turning to and fro watching the flight of the shuttlecock, for Johnny Cronk has emerged the champion in tlir Intramural Badminton Tourna- ment. The champion, who in one of the mainstays of the Bison tennis squad, wielded his badminton racket to a thrilling 17-14, 1.5-13 triumph over his formidable foe. Bill Rogers, last I > ear's \nctor. In dethroning Rogers j list Thursday evening in Davis Gym,"
I,"Cronk proved himself the master of I many skills and techniques of the I .shuttlecock game. Rogers had but three points to gamer, to win the first set, when Cronk came back to Rrasp victory, after allowing the former two more markers. The second .set proved to be one of the most thrilling of the tournament. Rogers accumulated 13 points, just 2 from victory, when Cronk turned the tide of the battle to come from be- hind  to win, 15-13. Both finalists really battled for ever>' point, with (ronk coming out on top of his very j evenly-matched foe. The handball tournament has pro- j I gressed to the point where there are !"
I,"but the two finalists who have sur- I ^ ived. These include Mar\' Gerla and Il'iud Vanderbilt. Gerla continued to display his versatility in the field of sports, when he downed Bielanow.ski, ! last year's champ. Mar\' was always j ahead of his highly-touted opponent in the quarter-final match, and won handily by the fwores of 21-10, 21-19. In the other quarter-final matches, Walt Wenrick ousted Gene Hayes, L'1-13, 22-20. Walt had to give ever>- thing he had in the second game to snatch victory from the hands of his gridiron teammate, who put up a great battle. Bud Vanderbilt display- <<d fine {6rm in trouncing Joe Longo, '.:i-8, 21-6. In the semi-finals on Monday, Ger- la met Bob Posner, a fre.shman ace, who has shown a great game in all his previous cimtests. But, Marv con. tinued his winning ways and downed I Posner by the tunes of 21-19. 21-17. i The first game looke<l like Posner's as it noared the end, when Gerla put on an effective rally to pull it out of the fire. Marv held the lead through- i out the second"
game.,Vanderbilt i came up against some stiff competi- tion in
Walt,"Wenrick, but finally emerged the victor in two exciting games by scores of 21-19, 21-19, to move into the finals against Gerla."

C.,"C. will 'play Delta Delta Delta; Phi Mu will compete with Pi Phi, and Alpha Chi I will battle Kappa Delta.

Date,"Last .Monday afternoon the 1941 varsity football squad began its first contact work, and, said Coach Hum- phreys, ""The boys are ready and will ing, but a long way from looking like a real ball club"". During the week the team has been practicing block- ing, play running, passing, and kick ing."
As,"cu.stoman,', the defense has looked much better than the offen.se. Scrimmage was begun this week and af Coach Humphreys is counting on only 24 days of drill, it will be rig- orously continued. One draw-back at present is that it is hard to get the men out to firactice on time becau.se of labs and mid-.semester exams, but after the vacation, training will go ahead ""full-.steam"". During the last few days the men have been working on a new shift on the offense which looked rather crude at first, but the sc(uad is picking it up fast. The players like it and are smoothing it out, getting a little co- ordination. Coach"
Al,"Humphreys said, ""We have fast backs and good passers, therefore we are expecting to play a more open game this year than In the past, and we are building our of- fense around this fact."" by John Buah Our secret agent X94o dashed up to our desk this 'week with a start- ling bit of information. He was also a bit upset because of his discovery too. Knowing that X945 is new at the game of sleuthing"
we,"checked and double-checked the facts of the case end learned that the ""info"" (that's the goods in professional parlance) was absolutely correct. The case centers around a well- known Bucknell athlete who played jthe role of the gracious host the past I weekend on the occasion of the Senior Ball and all the fixins* that go with jthe affair. I The charge: Willful deceit through I falsification of the facts. I The evidence: Said athlete has been yelping since the round of weekend activity concluded that ""it co.sts a lot of money to entertain 'imports'.""

F. and .M. has always been a ""jinx"" club for Bucknell. and reports are that the Diplomats boast another strong out- fit this season. On April 22, three days after the"
F.,&
M.,"meet, the team will open its home season by p]a>ing host to neighboring Susque- hanna."
A,series of trial runs are being held this week to determine who will sepresent the team at the Penn Re- lays on April 25 and 3fi. The team iit entered in the mile relay on both i days. Four men compose the select
j,"group and each man nins 440-yards before passing the baton to the next , man. I^st year's team placed only i fourth, but with such a representative lot to choose from, this year's quar- tet should fare much better. Con- tenders are: Capt. Ray Armor, Paul Damon, the intramural 440 winner. I'arle Thomas, Bob Shaffer, Dave Culp, Carl Moore, George Good, Jack Wilson, and Charley Schrieher, the intramural cross country champion Of the group, .^rmor. Thomas, and Shaffer represented the team last year; Vic Cannestro, the other run- ner,  has been lost through gradua- tion.      Armor is the only one who <<eems to have assured himself a place while any of the others have a good chance to qualify. For the past few seasons now, the team has depended largely apon th"" performance of the men in the run- ning events, but this season the men entered in the field events have shown ^#Tceptional promi.se.

F&M,"Bucknell's varsity tennis team, with but one week of practice, is sched- uled to meet the netmen of Franklin and Marshall College on April 16, two day after Spring recess. There is no doubt that the shor*: time that remains will be a decided handicap to the Bi.sons in their initial contest, but reports from"
F.,and
M.,"show the Lancaster team to be having the same difficulties. Because th.^ courts are still in no condition to be ! played on the whole extent of the teams practice has been a few night sessions in Davis Gymnasium, where at least the team can loosen up some- what and get the feel of the racquet. Despite this lack of practice, the team on the whole feels quite confi- dent about their coming .season, main- ly because of the fact that the entire team is made up of veterans, which include John Cronk, Dan Richardson, Mil Carson, Bob Rink, Joe Culbert- Fon, Fred Griffin, and Tom Bum.s. money?"" in the negative, and you'll agree with u.<<-- that 35c is"

[WEEKEND.,"If the athlete in ques- tion remained in bed for 72 hours, then of course we'd have to admit that 35c was"
a,"lot of money to ""throw"" away. It all started Saturday afternoon vhen the girl-friend alighted from a train at Sunbury. She has travelled fiom Buffalo and the fare ($9.50) was her worrj-. She didn't worry we i're informed but paid for the ticket. Our heroic host whisked her away to I^wnsburg. Mode of transportation? -- Fedan donated for several hours by Coach Al Humphrey.s. Compensation by athlete to Coach Humphreys?--] one wash job that never materialized because the pledges didn't get up on Saturday morning. X495, a stickler f(>r accuracy, adds a memo: Coach"
A,"I Humphreys paid for the gas. Oh yes, the eats. Thanks to the"
S.,
A.,"E. house, all the food was sup- plied gratis. (In all, about a half- dozen servings for too, Jeeves!) Up to this time not a single penny had stirred from the coffers of our Bucknell sportsman. Since this par- ticular athlete is a former employee of the Hotel I/ewisburger, the present manager generously offered a room in the ""Burger"" for the sweetheart's lodging. Here's where X490 made the big- rfst discovery'. The couple got into the dance via a ""service ticket"" (that is an Annie Oakley or ""free"", see). That was all above board and in line with the best ethical .standards since tlie host had served on the gate at many dances in his eight semester* of matriculation. I knew you'd .start to wonder about the corsage sooner or later. The ath- lete worried about it, later-- and it only cost him 25c. Just the same as the other boys bought for their gals, (*nly his arrived at 11 p. m.-- sorry, he went after it. ' They both enjoyed the dance, bo the story goes, so much in fact that they didn't have time to grab a sand- ^#wich or a drink of pop. (The water was delicious). Our athletic playboy really splurg- ed after the affair, however. Y'ea sir ; -- to the tune of 10c -- all for two coca colas (with lemon). ! Add up all the expenses and you'll get a total of 35c."
Wow!,How can some guys be so loose with their dough. How did the sweetheart get back? Thank Mouse Bessel for the use of his Ford for the trip to Sunbury and then close the ledger.

C.,"Mart.s, was called by his countrj' yesterday to serve in a moment in her history when skill and ingenuity of every American is needed to save the fatherland from tho .scnurjfp of *war, when the very keystone of world democracy is beinp: shaken"
by,"the ravaginp of powor-mad tyrants, when nur principles of freedom, peace, and happiness are beinx calleng^ed by the cannons of lust and hate, so capably beinp; advanced with blood and steel by Mr. Hitler and liis limpinp hench- man, Benito, who.se >rreatest secret weapon, as he has demonstrated in his conque.sts, is the German Army. ^Vhen Dr. Marts takes up his new duties as Executive Director of the newly create*! Pennsylvania State Council of Defense, he will be carry- ing out to the full the recommenda- tion which he made to Bucknell stu- dents la.st fall, ff^prarditip the attitud"" which they should take toward na- tional conscription of Ainrrican man- power. In Septeml>er Dr. Marts said to a Bucknell chapel audience. ""En- tertain no wild thoughts about ieav- ir.g an education for voluntary' enlist- ment of any kind in the national de- f<<-nse program. Wait until you arc called, then pive your ser\-ice to our l)eIoved republic with all you have"". In another chapel address in Jan- uary, Dr. Marts reaffirmed his plea to students not to enlist in the army or navy, but rather wait until their country calls them, in the meanwhile takinj? advantage of the educational opportunitios which they have, and which will be so seriously needed v\hen the world once moi'e starts to emerge from its present chaos."
Now,"President Marts has set an example for Buckn' llians. Already jfreatly overburdened with many ad- ministrative duties of super\'ising a University and also a great business enterprise in New York City, he has not hesifatod to srivo his full inrnpure"

area.,"! Under the direction of Rav .\rmor. , by Bob Lambert Decca officials have unearthed 8om>> veiy great music that was recorded in 1936 for English release. This is the first time the sides have been re- leased in this country and the elapsed f ve years have done nothing to mar their beauty. Four sides sung by Mildred Bailey with an all star ac- companying orchestra, are the best, but they'i-e not far ahead of the .stuff playe<l by Bu<i Freeman's Orchestra with Bunny Berigan. Joe Marsala's Delta Six offers one of few chances to hear Bobby Hackett desert his ci.rnet and play some wonderful gui- tar. These records were made for jazz fans. They are completely un- c(-mmercial, and the musicians wer<' in a position where they didn't care v,hether or not the stuff would sell -- they just wanted tf> make goo<l music and they did. .As I>'onard Feath- er says in the accompanying notes ""No straining for effects, no attempts .It appealing to the 'ickies' -- these were the precepts that made this n session in a thousand."" (Decca al- bum No. 200). ""I^dy In The Dark"" is an advent- urous  experiment in the .American theatre. Its plot is based on a psy- choanalj'tic theme and many of the scenes are dream se(|uences. Music for a show such as this is a difficult a.ssignment, but Kurt Weill, who wrote the music for ""Knickerbocker Holiday"", did a beautiful job. Hilde- j,arde has recorded an album for Dec- ca (No. 208) that brings out the full beaii*v of the music and the quality of Ira Gershwin's lyrics. The .Saga Of Jenny is especially good -- listen to the end of the second verse for the best Hildegarde yet recorded. MIl-DRKD"
BAILEY,"-- When That Man Is I,ead And Gone and The Saga Of Jenny (Decca PMl ). Mildred's reappearance on wax is most welcome and if she keeps on making records like this .she's going to  be doubly welcome. On these sides .she sings with incredible feeling and warmth, and remains pleasantly re- laxed and quiet too."

I^t an 18-inch snowfall blanket the Bucknell campus, let mid-semester exams pile up suddenly, let Spring come, there is still a place in the har- ried heart of every Bucknellian fo>>"" hin or her closest friend -- the dog. In the Phi Gamma Delta hou.se. it is ""Fiji"", six-year old black mixture of German Shephenl and Newfound- land breeds. ""Fiji"" went to live there more than three years ago and already her influence has placed her among the most famous dogs on the campus. Aside from the squirrels that make tlieir home on the campus, ""Fiji"" was the fir.st to place her bid for the only permanent animal occupation on these "".300 acres"". Recently the Sig- na Phi Epsilon fraternity selected a canine for the house and tagged him ""Grondu"". Then came Phi Kappa I'si with a St. Bernard nominee for collegiate admiration in ""Judy"". The late.xt of all tenants is ""Wildcat"", an I'nglish Blue Tick, now ""at home"" on the s'M'ond floor of West C<<)llege. ""Fiji's"" Fame is Far-flung ""Fiji's"" supremacy still reigns, however.

It was not. as is so often the case, a matter of a child's .""*ttempting. with barely adequate t<<'chnique and entirely inadequate .emotional maturity, to deal with music that should have been left un- touched for years; rather it was, for I the most part, an incredible exhibi- jtton of genuine musical artistry and unbelievable technical equipment. .As in the ca.ses of Menuliin and Heifetz -both of them prodigies, it will for some time be a discoutaging day for a nature violinist when he heaT< thi^ ijvirl plaj . I The program was one of staggering dimensions and worked well to show I the various aspects of .Miss Wicks' Iniusicianship off to good advantage. {although it was rather heavily weighted in the technical end. The jfinst number, a Vivaldi sonata with i freely realized figured bass, was done I with excellent attention to detail. (However, it was in the Paganini Con- certo in D major that Miss Wicks I really showed h<>>r mettle.

Lambert's Favorite Artists One way to obtain an insight into a jazzman's personality is to discover his favorite artists, bands, selections, etc. Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunce- ford, the Sextet of the Rhj-thm Club of liondon (which recorded only two discs), and the Varsity Seven are the bands which share top honors in Bob Lambert's estimation. Bix Beider- becke, greatest trumpet eer of all time, who died unfortunately and n>uch too soon, naturally tops the list of favorite artists. Three represen- tative samples may be cited when the question of favorite selections is brought up: ""Black and Tan Fan- tasy"", by Duke Ellington and his band; ""Rocking Chair Blues"", with Bessie Smith and the Mauch Chunk Stompers; and ""Serenade To"

The baseball team was a bit dis- appointing in their first outing of the eeason against Sus<iuehanna, but they did show some nice fielding and also pitching strength and all that's really needed to get them going is a little hitting power. Thus far it appears as though the big gun of the offense is going to be Freshman Bob Keegan, a gweet little third baseman, who can really powder a ball. That home run and single of his against the Crusad- ers were both well hit balls driv-ing in two of the team's three runs. In- cidentally, it seems as though Bob, who is also an outstanding basket- ball player, must have been thought of pretty highly in his high school days, for in his junior year he was voted the outstanding high school athlete in Rochester and was award- ed a two week trip around the entire International l>>>ague circuit with the Rochester Re<l Wings.

For these headlines are quick and powerful and sharper than any two-e<lged sword. They shall not return frustrated in their mis- sion, but shall accomplish the purpose for which they go forth. Lon- don or Berlin may pa.ss away, but these words remain forever, pro- I)hetic. stem, and withal forgiveness and love. Of the increase of their kind of government and peace there shall be no end. While per- haps there may be always some kind of war and rumors of war, all the best bets and all the best people are on the side of peace. For they^ that take up the sword shall perish with the sword, for He breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder. Some of the greatest off- spring of the scriptures are the peacemakers of the world. Slowly but surely they are turning swords into plowshares and spears into jruning hooks,"" until nation shall not lift sword against nation neither shall they learn war any"
more.,"And that abomination of the earth whose usurious dividends flow from destruction, blood, and agony: that .-synonymous twin devil of munition maker and war maker will be out- lawed and perish from the earth. No follower of the scriptures and no disciples of democracy can find any justification for any aggressive"
war.,"The Christian gospel has not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them, and no good end justifies evil means, for we may not do evil that good may come. ""Union, Now"" is a legitimate child of the scriptures, and has teen potentially on the agenda of the kingdom of peace for a long time. While it is one of the younger sons of the peace-makers of the world, it gives promise of inheriting all the birthrights of a first-bom .=on. It is nothing more than a normal and natural expansion of an American idea, which, having proved successful at home, has been adopted throughout the civilized world."
O,"America! America! Thou that breedest the prophets of de- mocracy, wilt thou stone thine own off.spring?, even as thou wast standing by, as.senting unto the death of the League of Nations, or wilt thou gather thy children together even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wing? The democratic world is looking to you for leader- ship. Are you going to save your selfish life and los<<> the world's esteem, or are you going to lose your complacent existence and find a more abundant life in a prosperous and peaceful world? Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, lest we neglect. liest we neglect. ""Union, Now"" is a great advance in world demf>cracy and neigh- borliness. Many Americans, like the English people, will become world travelers, more broadminded and sympathetic. Contributing to the consummation of these great blessings, there will be in many in- stances a common language, a common currency, a common citizen- ship, combined defense forces, free trade, and a"
common,"postal and communication system. In calling signals against aggressor nations of the world, we .shall kill our enemies with kindness if possible, with more of this world's goods for the have-not.s, with a freer intercourse of all nationals, breaking down racial prejudices, with our hearts steadfastly directed along the paths of peace, and our homage to only one ideal, the Prince of Peace. The king's business requires haste. Democracy is notoriously slow. Procrastination is dangerous and tremenrously high-priced. ""Union Now"" is a tide in the affairs of a great democracy, which, taken at its present flood, will lead on to a great victory for mankind. Neglected, it will lead to dictators and totalitarian states and enslave- ment. Let the dead bury their dead, but we who believe in democracy, let us close its gaps with a united front. There are hardly as many obstacles in a United Democracy as there are differences in the Prote.stant church. When Protestants agree on the Lord's Prayer, whether we shall forgive our debts or for- give our trespasses, about ninety percent of their differences will have dissolved themselves. In the light of New Deal history, now is the time to compromi.se on the word ""debts'"". And whether democracy is a 1941 model or a mixlel"
"T,","they all have similar engines, and rubber tires and some kind of a body. Let's forget the gadgets and agree on the essentials, for they that are not against us are for us. We are traveling in the same direction. Let's give them a lift. We might need one ourselves someday. The good liord made our body with two ends and a few append- ages. One end is to think and act with, and the other is to sit on and grow conservative. Which end are we going to use? Are you going to wait your tum for a good swift kick, or are you going to uinile while there is >et"
time?,"But in any case, you can bet all the scrip- tures you know, that heads you win and tails you lose."

Tans,"by Jeanne Rockwell To Tan or .\ot To Tan, TTiat is the tjuestion; but to the sun soaked bodies lying atop the Dining Hall loof there is no question to the mat- ter at all. These women want to look (iark brown and they will go to any liingths to attain the desired shade, especially around Houseparty week- end. Every wann Spring it's the .same old story, one by one those de- voted to the cause attire themselves in the least possible clothes, collect pillows, blanket."", sun-glasses, bridge card.s, books, papers, and kerchiefs and proceed to I^arison Second floor. At this point the party assumes ex- pedition proportions. The line forms ttneath the ladder, a girl at the top catches the gear thrown to her by the Ascending sun-tanner, and the roof is .<<tormed. Previously inhabited only ny squirrels, even these lowly animals think there is something nutty going on. First a layer of newspapers is spread over the tar and gravel; (not even medieval torture approaches the pain of omitting this step) then a blanket is put down and one after another the bodies divest themselves of all but bra and shorts."
A,"Crucial Step The thing of next importance is to decide which of a number of sun tan EUR'>>ides you desire to use. There are s-everal schools on the subject. One Alpha Chi favors vinegar liberally splashed over the exposed frame, thus leaving you smelling for the rest of the day like a semi-ripe salad d>>-eRsing. Then there is the Salt Water school, ns headed by one Pi Phi with ver>- determined views. The salt water theory is ver>' closely tied up with the idea that you tan easily at the t)each, by dam, and a beach is near salt water, henco the method. No one has yet thought of bringing sand to sprinkle around, but you never can tell what will happen from day to day. lA)tn of girls neglect entirely to lie ftet first facing the sun and are very surprised when they don't get as beet red as their sisters. Still others move around, talking, visiting and signalling by semaphore >*ith the Demies; and this type too wonders why it doesn't get tanned. The only good method is to lie still for three .solid hours and not move a muscle. Then one automatically moves into the Infinnary as did one innocent Freshman. The Improvements Committee Three hours is a long time to do nothing in, but it's amazing how the time flies. Reading is usually out because you either fall asleep or the .'-weat drips off your brow and mars both your vision and the book. Most satisfactory way to spend the time is thinking. This can be done to your- self, or out loud to annoy any friends >ou may have. Best way to do this i.<<: to think up about six delightful things which would help"
make,"the Dining Hall roof the Hanging Gar- dens of Central Pennsylvania. The first item would be the in.stal- lation of row upon row of adjustable and well padded deck chairs. The .second would be a wind and nosey people .vreen, to keep both these un- desirables out. Third would be an .'ittendant to pick up the things that always manage to go over the wall. Fourth would be a free soda fountain and lunch bar. This list can go on indefinitely. What we really need is a tra.sh can to put papers in, and a new ladder so we won't have the ner- vou.s jeebies overytime we climb over the roof wall!"

women,"at soma time in the year, and there couldn't be a better time for it than  now, when spring touches our campus with beau- ty and charm. Incidentally, the fra- ternity pledges can really enjoy it nfter going through Hell Week. One night at the house is strietly formal. Then, tuxes and formal gowns lend the air of gay sophistica- tion to the occasion. This is the night when Bucknell co-eds are privi- leged to use one of those rare thing;! called 2:30 permissions, and also one of the few times a year when the girls in the Sem wear corsages. On Saturday, some of the fellow<i anil girls"
go,"picnicking, some g<< .'wimming, and others .spend the af- ternoon walking. Saturday evening^ is usually taken up with an informal dance. Then, on Sunday, the girls have dinner at the house, after which a walk may be in order. No wonder Bucknellians love Houseparties. There is one thing, however, that ]>uzzles some of them.

Active in altruistic work among the national fraternities is Pi Beta Phi's settlement school, in Gatlin- biirg, Tennessee. This project, es- tablished in 191(>> as a memorial to the founders of the fraternity, has brought a 12- year school and hospit- alization to a mountain community once i.solater from the outside world. Pi Phi's throughout the nation are bound together in fellowship and unity by ""The Arrow"", the national magazine, and by the golden arrow with the shaft of pearls, the pin of Pi Beta  Phi. The colors of Pi Phi are Wine and .Silver Blue. Pennsylvania Beta of Pi Beta Phi has an outstanding record this year. Particularly significant is the recent achievement of the province cup for outstanding accomplishment. One of the pledges, Jean Dyer, was chosen the outstanding pledge of Beta Pro- vince, and initiated at Beta Province Convention in Pittsburgh last week- end. It was at this convention that Bucknell's Pi Phi won the province cup. Alberta McCreery ia president of the chapter this year."

DOWNBEAT:,"The Intersorority Sing is next Tuesday night. They're goin^ to or- ganize the noise that comes from the sorority suites every day into a few rollicking verses of ""Going Home*' towards a cup for the suite mantel- piece. S<>>riously, the probability of future Intersorority and interfratemity sings depends upon the support given this one. The Phi Mu's, defending cham- pions who capture<l the cup in the last *ing two years ago will, from the sound of all four floors of Hunt Hall every afternoon, have to meet stilT competition to keep the cup on tho first floor suite (probably some one wants to know how the Bucknellian staff found out the Phi Mu suite was on first floor!)"

Glee Club and I minstrels from the rear of the audi- j torium. After the company had j taken their places, the show swung I into action with the minstrels keeping I up a steady stream of jokes, songs j and dances. Paul Hightower with I his Texan drawl was the interlocutor. Bob Morrison as Rastus and Bob Teter as Andy put on a very amusing barber shop skit satirizing the barber j talents of Hank Peters. The audi- I ence especially enjoyed the cracks that were aimed at the students and i faculty members. The big hit of the ' evening, however, was the May pole dance by Al Humphrey's Beef Trus- ' ters. These fellows, dressed as chorus girls, nimbly danced and sang about the pole, becoming more entangled in the ribbons the longer they danced. The Glee Club and the University Quartette sang several numbers, fea- I turing ''Casey Jones"" and ""Frankie j and Johnny"". The show ended with 1 the full cast singing Ir%'ing Berlin's i ""God Bless America."""

Here,"Clarence Streit, originator of Fed- eral Union, and Dr. Frederick Schu- man, professor of government at Wil- liams College, highlighted the Ved- cral Union convention here Friday and Saturuday at a general .session, preKide<l over by Dean Shimer of the faculty, to explain the need for and working plan of their solution for world peace. Author of two books on Federal Union and chief cni.sader for it, Clar- ence Streit served as a reporter first on a Philadelphia paper and later on the New York Times in Europe dur- ing the po.^t-World"
War,"peace at- tempts and at the Geneva Conference. Out of that war's turmoil Mr. Streit saw precipitated the inevitable con- flict of today, which he feels America and England mu,<<t adopt"
a,"federal union to remedy. ""For a working example of such a union"", said he, ""we can look at the union of the American colonies."" ""Unfortunately"", Streit continued, ""the constitution they later formed stands now for a forgotten peace and foreign policy. We face today the first alliance ever made against the American people. Since ?>igland is fighting our war, we must join with her in a federal union to preserve our nation."" Agreeing that United States is in the most dangerous period of its hi.""?- tory. Dr. Schuman asked the audience two major questions: (1) what is oui* stake in this war, an<<l (2) who will soon have to fight it? ""First"", he declared, ""this is a death .struggle between totalitarian- ism and democracy; secondly, 'we' and 'they' confront each other. 'We' will presently be reduced to the United States alone and 'they' already consist of the nggregate whole nf th-^ world."" It i.""? a purposeless effoit among the democracies, according to Dr. Schu- man, that may lose our war for ex- istence. Dictatorships, on the other hand, wield more force because they have a fixed purpose -- that of enslav- ing tho globe- -and therefore nrr fearles.<<. Britnin sees in victory but a chance to re-establish the former balance of power, while it rests with America to con.struct a system of in- SLring the .safety of the democratic peoples, a task Federal Union can ac- complish. In reply to objections that the plan is too idealistic. Dr. Giddens, of the political science department at Alle- gheny College: Dr. Vernon N'a.sh, na tional director of Federal Union; and Dr. ?:mest Meyer of Bucknell in a conference .Saturday morning stated that it is no more so than was tho consolidation of the early American colonies 150 years ago.

Problems,"MiSH Mary Town.send, head of the Townsend Sers-ice in Philadelphia, spent last Tuesday on campus, dis- cussing the employment situation uith Bucknell students. .Miss Town- sind interviewed students all day, and V as .scheduled to hold"
a,"discussion period for women students after din- ner Tuesday evening in I^irison liv- ing Room. New fields that are open- ing for women, and the different qualifications for specific positions in \arious fields were the main points .""he talked on. Miss Townsend. who was here in Cf.nnection with the University place- ment bureau, act as a contact person for different universities in their placement set-up. The .^<<>r\'ice which f he represents is an employment and vocational guidance bureau, dealing ' vith .student employment problems. by Shelton Bamett In 1928 a group of students repre- senting (>50 American colleges tra- veled westward to engage in the finals of the National Intercollegiate Oratorical contest held at Ijob An- geles. Among this group was a young Bucknell student who was rep- resenting Pennsylvania at the con- test. When the winners of this na- tional content were announced, this Ftudent brought honor and prestige to Buckaell by coming out  in fourth place among the top collegiate ora- tors fo the nation. Today, some thirteen years after- v.ards, this man is still representing Bucknell, but now in a different ca- pacity. He is Bucknell's Alumni Sec- retary, I... Francis Lybarger. Mr. I.ybarger is Bucknell's ""contact man"". He is continually on the move, tra- veling for the college, presenting to hundreds of prospective Bucknell stu- dents scenes of Bucknell life that he has recorded with his camera. Mr. Lybarger's pleasant manner, and his natural, native ability to present in word pictures the facts, truths and advantages awaiting them at Buck- n<<ll have produced results which are now reflected in the fact that the col- lege is filled to capacity this year. Mr. Lybarger was born in Mifflin- burg and attended school there. His fjither was for twenty years a noted speaker on the Chautauqua circuit, until he retired to practice law in Mifflinburg. Among Mr. Lybarger's circle of friends was included William Jennings Bryan. For eight years the elder Mr. Lybarger maintained a sil- ver trophy that was presented to the winner of the local high schools de- bating contests. From his early boyhood Mr. Ly- barger, Jr. interested himself in pub- lic speaking. \Vhile in high school he participated in debating, and sue- 1 '^^^ ceeded in winning his father's award , v.hile still a sophomore. In lf>24 he entered Bucknell. His speaking abil- ity was quickly recognized by Profes- sor Coleman and"
Roy,"Howes, who v;cre then coaching debating. Under their expert tutelage he became one rf Bucknell's foremost orators. At that time debating received almost as much attention as football does tdday. It was not a rare occurrence that when debates were held, old Convention Hall would be packed, and crowds of people turned"
away.,"For three years Oxford University sent a debating team to Bucknell to engage the Bucknell team in a test of their forensic abilities. Mr. Lybarger's speaking ability became more and more evident when in 1928 he won the Eastern Oratorical Association contest, and placed fourth in the National Intercollegiate Ora- trrical contest while representing Pennsylvania at Iv)8 Angeles. He had been varsity debater throughout fill his four years, and captained the debating team, and was a seasoned veteran of thirty intercollegiate de- bates. Besides debating, Mr. Lybarg- er confessed he also played trumpet ill a .school orchestra. In 1928 he graduated from Bucknell with an"
A.,"R. degree. After college lie became assistant to his father in his legal practice at Mifflinburg. Ho became prominent in civic affairs, and was elected Justice of the Peace, a position he still holds. He was also i.sstrumental in organizing the Ki- wanis in Mifflinburg, and was presi- dent of that organization for some time. In 1935 Mr. Lybarger was of- fered the position of debating coach at Bucknell. He coached debating for three ytars. In 1937 he became .\lumni Secretan,', the position he now occu- pies. Mr. Lybarger is well known i for his photography, some very gra-"

L.,"Stim- son. Lindbergh made public his letter to the president explaining his decision to resign the commission which he has held since 1927, the year of his solo hop across the Atlantic. One of the most striking paragraphs of this Utter is, ""I take this action with the utmost regret, for"
my,relationship with the Air Corps is one of the things that has meant most to me in life.
I,"place it second only to my right as a citizen to speak freely to my fellow countrymen, and to discuss v.;th them the i.ssues of war and peace which confront our nation in this crisis."" The loss of Col. lindbergh is a blow to American national defense which is in desperate need of every experienced officer that it can muster into service."
A,"man of his caliber and qualifications is a valuable asset to any armed force. We don't believe in appeasement, and we don't think that we'll be lick- ed by any invaders, but we do believe tnat freedom of speech is the inalien- nblr right of every American citizen.

With,the
coming,"of spring to Buffalo Valley, there follows another event close upon its heels, which is fitting in character and appeal to the picturesque verdure of the Bucknell"
campus,in May.
Houseparty,time at Bucknell is an
occasion,
motivated,"not only by the formal and informal social festivities which are such an intriguing part of the weekend's festiivities, but is fundamentally an expression of that effervescent enthusiasm which we always experi- ence upon looking across rolling acres of"
newly-awakened,"lawns,"
when,we contemplate the first full bloom of apple blossoms and the rich gold of forsythia.
"""Now","the cup is so full That a drop o'erfills it;"" BuckncU's vernal setting for spring house parties this season is at its most colorful"
height.,
The,weather is perfect; the
campus,is at its greatest
beauty.,This should be one of the University's most
memorable,social
weekends,in history.

run.,"This year's team of Captain Ray Armor, Dave Culp, Bob Shaffer, r.nd Bob Snyder was the first Buck- nell relay team to win a medal at the Penn Relays since 193r>, when the Bisons won the college mile relay in the much slower time of 3:29:8. Fourth in Middle Atlantic Mile On Friday, the team competed In the Mi<ldle Atlantic mile relay, and placed fourth behind I^ehigh, Haver- ford, and Rutgers in the time of 3:28, Dave Culp was the lead-off man for Bucknell in this race, and although he was spiked during the ru.-th for the inside lane, he ran a 53 second quar- ter, two seconds faster than he ever ran before. Bob Snyder reeled off a 54 second quarter and handed the baton to Bob Shaffer"
who,"ran the distance in 51.6. Capt. Ray Armor, rpnniiig jinchor, turned in a dazzling 4!t.6, to give the Bisons fourth place. So close was the finish that only five yards separated .Armor from Captain VVooters, I>ehi>rh's anchorman. Pin- ishing behind Bucknell were: Muhlen- b'.irg, Lafayette, Dickinson, Saint Josephs, Alfred, and Swarthmor?. The Bisons had little luck when positions for  the inside lane were chosen. They were in the lane next to the outside on both days, which meant that they had to cut to the outside to pass the baton. For this rta.son they lost about a place with every pass on Friday. .Set All Time Bucknell Record .Although the team was only five yards behind when they placed fourth on Friday, they trailed Villanova by ten yards when they finished second en Saturday. It was in Saturdays race, the College Mile, in which the quartet literally exhau.sted all their energy in setting the all time Buck- r.ell record. Culp, still favoring hi* injured leg ran a 53.4, while Snyder ran a neat 52, faster than any of his j)revious tries. Shaffer really gallop- ed those 440 yards, when he did 51, end Armor, who was in a class by I'imself, ran a fine .50 second anchor leg to assure the Bisons of second p'ace. Bucknell placed ahead of St, Francis, St. Paul, G<<'ttvsburg, Dick- inson, and Shippensburg State Teach- ers, who fini.shed in that order. The relay was the la.<<<t for Captain Armor who has now made visits to the Relays in his sophomore, junior, j.nd senior years. It was the first and last trip for Dave Culp who is o'so a senior, while Shaffer and Sny- der, only juniors, will be available for next year. Meet DickinKon Track .Squad Tomorrow afternoon the Bisons 1 'ay host to Dickinson. The Bucknell track team has a record of one win ;^nd one loss so far this season. Sus- quehanna fell victim to the Bi.wns in the last meet, while Franklin and Marshall put the black mark on thr schedule in the opening meet of the reason. In the last meet, against .Susquehanna, the team showed more strength in the field events as well as the running events, and it is hoped that they will be able to get on the plus side of the ledger against Dick- inson  tomorrow.

SEVEM,"by Morty .Siiberman Big news on the Bison sports front ihia week was the very creditable showing registered by Bucknell's fly- iny quartet of Ray Armor, Dave Culp, Bob Shaffer, and Bob Snyder in the annual Penn Relays run this past Friday and Saturday at Philadelphia Best time recorded for an Orange and Blue runner at the meet was Cap- tain Armor's remarkable 49.fi quarter in the Middle Atlantics relay on Fri- day in which the Bison runners fin- ished fourth, only 1.2 seconds behind the f^rst place Rutgers team ,,0n ftaturday again paced by .Armor, who n.n a flat 50 second quarter, the B."

Much of the credit for the fine showing of John Plant's boys on the second day should go to Bob Sny. der, who bettered his Friday time by a whole 2.fi seconds to run a nice 52 second quarter Bob Shaffer ran a 61.6 the first day and chalked up the Bisons' second best time with a flat 51 on Saturday Dave Culp, the team's first man ran a very good .53 on Friday, and, despite his being .<;;uite .severely spiked in that race, ran a 63.4 on the second day ._...It must <<lso be considered that Culp was the only man to run from a standing start, the three others having running etarta All In all, as Coach John Flant remarked, ""The boys did lot.""* better than was expected "" Other news on the Bison sport >> front isn't quite as cheery Poor Johnny Sitarsky, a swell guy and a good coach, is having his woes these days on the baseball diamond At the time of this writing Bucknell's diamond warriors have taken to the field four times, and have yet to find their first win It's sad but true, the team is very weak this year and win be fortunate to come out with five wins However, two bright apots continue to shine in a losing rause Both are freshmen and might signify a new era (sounds good for Bison baseball Bob Kee- gan's long triple against Juniata has established him as the No. 1 slugger of the team....- Phil Stamm, the Hugh Mulcahey of the collegiate league, with a little better support really has the stuff to breeze through some good competition oh well, look at the Phillies.

Courts,"by Sy Berger Displaying the spiritcni fight and determination that led them into the finals, the Kappa Sigma volleyballers came through to vanquish the Sigma Chi stalwarts and annex the 1941 in- tramural volleyball crown. It took the big Red outfit three hard-fought games before they finally came out on the long end of the score by the tune of 10-21, 21-11, and 21-15. The final match started on Monday afternoon on the new outdoor volley- ball courts, and before the first game was over, it looked as if the Sigma Chis had the Kappa Sig's number. The C^i's batted and spiked their way to a decisive 21-10 triumph. But, the second game took on a different aspect. As the sun was slowly low- ering, the Red spiker.'* were suddenly revitalized. Their spirited and hard play gave them a 7-5 lead, when dark- ness hovered over the playing field- The intramural spring sports manag- er then changed the site of the con- test to Davis Gym, amid the violent Sigma Chi protests.

However, there is a possibility that the Sigma Chis may protest due to the change of court-s. It was a great tournament, and the two finalists proved their rights to compete for the trophy as a result of the Ch'i'a decisive 16-8, 15-lS victory over I-imbda CTii in the semi-finali, and the Kappa Sig's victory over S."

CAMPUS,"by Betty Miles Seems no time at all since mother was decked out in a buddingr cor- sage, a.id presented with a picture for ""that certain empty comer""-- and yet, a glance at the calendar tells us that its Spring Festival time once more, and time for Bucknell mothers to be the guests of their cherished offsprings at the annual Mother's Day celebration. So here's ""Hello"" to Mother's Day weekend, and, just by way of ""Goodbye to houseparties"", lets turn the clock back, and look over last week's events on campu.s. rr c_^ -ea Howard Gale and his orchestra played for both the formal and semi- formal dunces at Kappa Sigma, and a buffet .supper, held on the back lawn, rounded out the festivities. The tables carried out the theme of Kappa Sigma colors in scarlet, white and Rreen. Thf favor given to the guests of Alpha Phi was a brown leather compact with the Kappa Sigma crest stamped on the cover. This favor was autograpable. a .'=' C-^S ""^ 3 Guests at Sigma Alpha Mu were presested with a gold brooch, mono- grammed with the fraternity seal. Bruce Bell and his orchestra sup- plied the music for the house. Jack Schechter, chairman, Harry Tuman and William Roos, constituted the social committee. Returning alumni #were Donald Robinowitz, '39, Manny Pearlman, '39, Leon Berke, '39, Paul Alpert, '39, Norman Tractenberg, '39, Marty Alpert, '40, and Floyd Van- derwart, '40. CT- c ^S ""^^ The .Sigma Phi Epsilon's ushered in their houseparty weekend with a formal dinner dance Friday evening. Banquet tables were set in the den, which was decorated in a traditional motif, displaying the fraternity seal and colors, with a large banner as the center of the display. (hi Saturday afternoon a picnic was held at Half Way Dam. and Saturday night the dance was informal. Louis Phillips and his I.ycomians provid- ed the music on both evenings. 1^"

Fun,"It's over now, and all that remains of the big weekend of houseparties is memories. It was indeed a gala affair and one that could not very easily be surpassed. Fellows and Kirls alike had a grand time tearing here and there, and doing no work for three days. r.lthough the professors often won- der). Friday night, there were"
a,"few (iinner-dances, but for the majority (f Bucknellians, the big weekend did not begin until 8:30 or 9:00 p. m., v. hen dates were scheduled for danc- ing at the house. It was on Friday night that the girls received their favors, which, in every case, wero beautiful gifts that would very easily ; rouse fond remembrances of house- larties at Bucknell, May 2nd, 3rd, and #1th, in '41. On Saturday, there were numerous llcnics. At this time, Bucknell men and women wandered into the wilds < anyway there were a few bushes around), and enjoyed the blossoming beauty of nature in the springtime. Then, some returned to the campus for the track meet against Dickinson, which, incidentally, Bucknell won."
A,"baseball game again.st Drexel was an additional drawing card at the sta- oium, and many houseparty couples watched Bucknell"
down,"the team from Philadelphia to the tune of 5-1. Saturday night, co-eds and men again danced at the house. The eve- ning was drawn to a close at 12:30, when Bucknell women had to be back f.t their dorms.. The majority of houseparty dates had dinner at the respective hou.sEURS on Sunday, and in the calm beauty of a <iuiet Simday afternoon, the week- end came to a perfect close. There i""? no doubt that the '41 hou.separties ^iere a success, and few Bucknellians will soon forget the fun they had last v.eekend."

Several of the chief stages of  the Ettist's development are included in the exhibition, from early still life and later figure subjects to recent hindscapes done in Colorado and Pennsylvania. The pictures admir- ably reveal his technical virtuosity and the wide range of artistic media he has at his command. The exhibi- tion is of particular in>>ere.<<?t to Buck- nellians because of the portrait of President Marts which the Class of 1'J39 commissioned Mr. Poor to paint r.nd which will .soon be completed. The show has added local interest be- cause of the fresco that Mr. Poor re- cently completed for the Old Main Building of the Pennsylvania State College which has been acclaimed by many critics as one of the finest murals in America. Tea will be served at the opening f'f the exhibition by students of the Bucknell Art Department. The paint- ings will be on view to the public throughout the Spring Festival, and afterwards, from 2:00 to fi:0O p. ra. (iaily, until Thursday, May 15."

THE,
BUCKNELLIAN,"by Betty Mileti To the usual whacking of tha racket againbt the ball, the whipping of the ball through the basket, th? flying of the arrow toward the bull's eye, and the sight and sound of num- erous other activities, Tustin Gym- nasium has added the whirr of the .sewing machine, the echoing of vari- ous folk tunes, and the beat of danc- ing feet. In brief, preparations for the 1941 Spring Festival are definite- ly under way. Miss Derr, assisted by Miss Geil, is centering this year's festival around a floral theme, with the girls cleverly costumed in accordance with the flower they represent. Tulipj, dahlias, holly hcoks, peonies, sham- rocks, .Scotch thistles, and"
a,"wide variety of flowers will be in evidence, sporting .skirts of vari-hued crepe jmper petals, and hats that carry out the flower motif. The girls will do dances typical of the country which one would ass<^)ciate with the ftowem they are portraying. With the advent of spring, the May Day participants have taken to the RTeat outdoors just beyond the girls' tennis courts, while several rooms in Tustin have been converted into sew- ing rooms, turning out some 95 fin- irhed crepe paper products that would be suitable rivals for Schiaparelle. Molyneaux, and the gamut of the de- signing world. UTiatever may be the design or patteni of the costumes, Tustin"
Gym,"Sewing Shoppe can handle it. This weekend will mark Bucknell's 27th observance of May Day. In 19J4 the Spring Festival as it is known to- day was inaugurated, a May Day pro- gram only Ix'ing presented previous to that time. For the seventh consecutive year, Miss Sylvia Derr will put the Festival hrough its paces. Since the presen- tation of the Rip Van Winkle pageant in 1934, she has produced a succes- sion of colorful May Day pageants, which have been presented each year to the Quoon and her court. This year's festival does not bid fair to be an exception. So once again its .Maj'time -- and that means the May pole dancing, the ;>agoant, the entire festival, the tuHp bed.K and the green, green lawn, the sunny sumnipr'.s day (we hope), and the cn)wning of the Queon herself. Pack we go to the dream days of our vf-ry early childhoml. Its Spring Festival time at Bucknell!

on,"the campus, especially before and during examinations, are reminiscent of the days before the steam engine. An investigation di.sclosed some of the pet superstitions rampant on the"

--,"chewing gum during an exam, wearing dark glasses, answer- ing the last question on an exam first, writing an exam in red pencil, and sitting through an"
exam,"with one's legs crossed. College seniors are supposed to be intellectual giants. Nevertheless, it seems that ""Old Man Superstition"" plays an important role in their school lives."
One,"graduate-to-be vowed that if he circled the profes- sor's desk three times before a quiz, a pas.sing grade would result. He claims that he has been doing thi.- since his freshman year and that he has never flunked a te.st yet. Wow! An accounting major went so fa- as to describe an entire system which he employs when opening the mail- box to obtain his grades. The tech- nique involves wearing a hat, saying a prayer, and opening the mail-box left-handed. We could go on to mention many other superstitions but most student.*? are familiar with the black cat, mir- ror, and ladder jinxs. If you're free from all these quirks, just keep your fingers crossed."

Most of the budding authors gav>>' their pieces high-.sounding names like ""The Ijfe and I/oves of Joe Doobel"", and ""One Man's IJfe"", or the ""Life of Willard Winkle"". Not our friend.

ALTHRA-:,"The title suggests that within the future Bucknell will have a distin- guished visitor on the campus. Truth is that ""\jord Bunthome of Althea"" :<< one of the permanent re.sidents of I^wisburg, particularly Bucknell. ""Lord Bunthome"" is Paul High- Icwer's pet canine and comes from a long list of illustrious sires. The red and white cocker spaniel's ""daddy ' was field champion of the United States on two separate occasions. The story of how *'Ix)rd Bunthome"" received the princely sobriequet \- knitted with a performance of Gilbert"
and,"Sullivan's famous opera, ""Pa- tience"" which was being staged the night of ""Bunny's"" birth. Incident- ally, Mr. Hightower performed one of the leading roles in the production. Wlien it was learned that two dogs comprised the litter, one canine was named ""liord Bunthome"", the other 'Lord Grosvenor"" after the two prin- cipal characters in the opera. You'll recognize ""Lord Bunthome"" by the mournful exprcs.sion of the spaniel. All efforts on the part of the male collegians to cheer him up osually fail. When the coeds gather 'round, ""Lord Bunthome"" cheers up."

Physical Geol- ogy 10;J, wherein students will use n'iniature models to watch at first- hand nature's processes in creating rivers, mountains, and other geologi- cal formations. Because of its practical, illustrative methods, the course is so unusual that j'Iready Clark and Harvard universi- ties ha\'e commented favorably on it. Students will work with small-scale models, as for instance one using oil, sand, and water so combined as to re- construct an oil well, that will elim- inate mathematics and simplify the I'henomena involved in the develop- ment of geological and topographical structures. By means of these working models, the purpose of the course is to clarify the evolutionary steps followed in l.-indslides, glaciation, drainage, de- t osition, earthquakes, ground-water movements, and the forming of oil N.ells and mountain.^. For example, a nifxle! will operate to show in a few tfiinutes the molding of a mountain, a procedure taking millions of years, with a bed of soft mud placed in a box, two of whose sides contract and produce a wrinkled surface exactly a:^> nature shaped the earth's surface. Perhaps no other American college. J..H far as the Bucknell geologry de- partment can ascertain, ever tried a similar plan of study. However, I^e- high once experimented with a com- parable method, but it fell far short cf the Bucknell course in extensive use of models and devices reproduc- ing the history of the earth, its .struc- ture, and water movements."

CAB,"CALIX)W.AY -- Willow Weep For .Me and Jonah Joins The Cab (Okeh <51()9). Willow consists merely of a series #)f alto sax choruses by Hilton Jeffer- Fcn, which starts out well and re- mains good for a while but then gets ; retty boring. Jonah Joins The Cab is a musical"
way,"of stating that Jonah Jones, who used to be a Stuff .Smith funny man as well as a fine trumpeter, is now a less fine trum- peter with the Cab and"
much,less funny.

A,small contingent of select men from the Duke's band

Opening with a couple of muted choruse.<< on trumpet by Rex it fades into a breathy, mel- low tenor sax chorus by Ben Web- ster, who is the most under-rated tenor man alive. Linger Awhile isn't as good, but Webster's tenor an<i .somebody's trombone shouldn't b** rkipped. IX)UIS"

Helen O'Con- nell's voice used to have a hook in it that was annoying, but it could be overlooked ....now it's becoming an anchor, and it's so obvir^is and af- fected that her vocals on these sides are awful -- and her vocals make up almost all of both sides.

With,this issue the
new,staff takes over
"""The",
"Bucknellian"".",
The,year before this the
working,editorial staff
of,
the,
paper,
numbered,one ; this past
year,five [>eople
have,been truly active
and,
now,there are
fourteen,
persons,
in,
new,
positions,
on,the
masthead.,
During,
the,year
"""The",
"Bucknellian""",
was,
edited,
by,Bill
"Crum,",a
man,
who,did his best to
improve,the paper
and,to
make,it a
cooperative,staff
venture.,
The,
genume,
pleasure,of his as- sociates in
working,for
him,
prove,better
than,
words,
how,well
he,
succeeded.,
Student,interest in the
paper,
grew,
and,
during,
the,
two,collegiate press
conventions,this year
"""The","Bucknell- ian"" carried off the"
major,
portion,of the cups.
But,an
eight-page,
paper,
cannot,be put out
every,
week,of the school
term,by a
working,
editorial,staff
of,
five,persons.
Sooner,or later
mistakes,creep into the
news,"stories, the"
copy,is
inaccurate,
sometimes,
and,the
headlines,get
incoherent,
and,dull.
Putting,out a
good,
paper,
becomes,
impossible,
and,
the,
work,is sheer
drudgery,
when,carried on
by,so few people. In the
coming,year the
masthead,
is,
not,
going,
to,carry
names,
known,only for their
promises.,If on it there are
people,
who,shirk
and,
show,"no responsibility, these"
names,will
be,re- ported to the
Board,of
Publications,and then
dropped.,
Every,single person on the
new,staff has
proved,so far he or she can
"work,",and
well.,
The,staff is
pledged,to a
paper,of ac- curacy and
interest.,
Everyone,
knows,his job and
we,sincerely
hope,that the results will
show,in a
new,
and,better paper.
The,
Yearns,
At,
The,
Spring,
The,ancients
had,true
wisdom,
when,they set
aside,
a,
day,each
Spring,for the celebration of the vernal
season.,Originally a
pagan,rite.
May,
Day,festivities
have,
come,to
be,
regarded,as really
joyous,and
Christian,
customs.,
In,
England,the traditional
Spring,
dances,
and,collection of flowers for
May,baskets
began,
many,
hundreds,of years
ago.,It is with a feeling of nostalgia that we
must,realize
now,that only here in
America,
have,
we,the
opportunity,"to carry on this pleas- ant, peaceful"
custom.,
Instead,of
May,"flowers, the"
English,are
gathering,
up,the
remnants,of their
"homes,","instead of listening to folk music, the"
populace,of Britain is listening to a harsh and
more,"terrifying tun*,"
made,
by,
air,
raid,
sirens,
and,shrieking
bombs.,
We,have so
many,
things,
to,
celebrate,
in,
America,this
Spring,that our
annual,festival here at
Bucknell,
should,take on a
new,
and,
deeply,significant
meaning.,
Perhaps,it isn't quite
proper,to bring up such serious
thoughts,on a gay
occasion,"like this, but let us rather look at it in"
another,
light.,
Spring,
means,re-birth of all those things that
we,
hold,"dear,"
and,
our,festival
commemorates,
this.,It
means,"the re-birth of our values, our ideals"
and,
our,faith in
God,and nature
and,
ourselves.,
For,this reason we
should,reflect a little as we
view,our green jmd lovely
campus,this Festival

G.,"Stolz The campus is very much indebted to the Mu Phi Epsilon musical or- janization which successfully spon* sored the Inter-Sorority Sonjf Con- t'jst at the BaptLst Chui-ch on Tues- day eveninjf. Six of our sororities competed in the contest. Delta Zeta, the first to appear, is a .small or^canizatiuii and Rave evi- dence of hard work with splendid re- Fults. The Phi Mu's appeared next uiid were the fortunate organization to i-eoeive honorable mention by the judpes. Their result.'* were commend- r.ble but improvement can be brought about by stre.ssinff tonality. The Tri Delt organization, which was the win- iier of the plaque, showed evidence of detailed attention to the various voice parts. They are especially to be commended"
on,their dynamics. The Alpha Chi's were inclined to be r.iPfred and sluppish in their attack.^ rnd releases but there was evidence of fine balance. Pi Beta Phi had ex- cellent material but unodubtedly fail- ed to apply hard work. They lacked spontaneity. The Kappa Delta's ex- rolled in general fine .-jpirit and show- ed careful thought
and,"traininR. They were probably on a par with I'lii Mu who received honorable men- tion and undoubtedly had the beat soprano section. The judges who graciously served in the contest were Mrs*. Mary Rich of Northumberland, and Mi.ss Kath- erine Reed of Sunbury. More power to Mu Phi Kpsilon to make po.ssible such encouraging mu- sical competition on our campus. May we expect a fraternity song contest next year? How about it. .\lpha Mu Beta ?"

The push-cart race ha<< always supplied its share of thrills and spills during past years.

The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity are the de- fendiftg champions from last year. The race will be divided into two different heats. The racing cart hav- ing the lowest time will lie declared the winner. The judges for the race will be Bernice Henry, Paul High- tower and Dean Page."
A,"large cup will be given to the winners. The committee in charge of the festivities consists of Dr. Gregory, chairman, Ruth Braden. Bud Vander- bilt, and John Kingsbury-. The course of the race will start from Bucknell Hall, past the Kappa Sigma and S. A."

"FESTIVAL,",
1941,"During the years that have passed since its inauguration in May, 1934, our annual Spring Festival has become the symbol of one of the important aspects of our life on the campus. The central motif of ths Festival is the traditional May Day celebration in honor of the Queen and her Court of Beauty. We have accepted the suggestion of this charming ceremony to set aside each year a few days appropriately to celebrate whatever gifts we may have for making life a more enjoyable, and a more abundantly creative experience.

The Bisons accounted for seven affair, when finally. Johnny pulled out of a 7-7 tie to van(|uish his foe, 9-7. Freddy Griffin came through in his veutil fine form by downing Fred Eg- loff, 6-4, fi-4. The bifr surprL^e of the ^/temoon was Miss Belle Farrar's three set victory over Bob Rink. The Buffalo lassie culminated Rink's 13- pame winning streak with a fine basic j;ame featuring an uncanny knack for steadiness. Rink took the first *#et fi-2, but the Buffalo girl came back with a 6-2 set, and then emerg- ed with an 8-6 victory to take the match. Come Through in Doubles In the doubles, Cronk and Griffin disposed of McClough and Fglig. 6-1, ^.-4, without any trouble. But Carson and Rink met an adverse fate as Miss larrar and Moore emerge<l victorious by the tune of 2-6, 6-2, 6-2. With the match tied at 4-all, Culbertson and Richardson paired against Goldstein and nine. The Bison lads took the first set, 6-2, but dropped the .second, 6-4. The next set was earmarked Bucknell, and the boys came out on top, 6-3. Coach Ballentine employed the same lineup, as the boys ran through the Drexel R()uad by the score of 8-1. The Bisons didn't .start off too well, as Parmet, the Drexel No. 1 man, de- feated Bill Carson in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4. But it was a totally differ- ent story after that. Jfihnny Cronk dropped hi.s first set 7-9, but then came back and trounced White 6-4, 6-.3. The Drexel player could not cope vnit Cronk's flat drives and booming smashe.';. The score read 6-0, 6-.'} whr-n Fred Griffin walk- ed off the court after taking the toll of Garwood. Determined to .start an- other winning streak, Bob Rink took It out on Mikkal in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2. Danny Richardson found little trouble in disposing of Thompson in he first set, 6-,3, but the Drexel boy c-mc hack and extended the Bucknell racqiieteer to a thrilling 11-9 victory. DrexePs Robertson tasted defeat at the hands of Joe Culbertson. After t&king the first .set, 6-.1, Robert.-wn could not cope with the carrot-topped Bison. Joe returned to form with a 6-4 victory in the second set. and finally came out on top in the third ret, 8-6. The doubles were swept"
by,our boys in seven sets. Parmet and Whitf extended the Cronk-Griffin
duo,"to cnly a 7-5 victory. But the Bison- men really showed their superiority with a splendid 6-0 set, to take it in ptraight .sets. Carson and Rink met Btaunch opposition in Garwood and Mikkal but finally friumpher with the colors, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4.

He vas playing every hole in par onto the greens, but once there, he could not one-putt a single one. and three- putted three. The fact that it was a strange course probably accounted for a lot of the trouble. In the .second foursome Britton look Hartman of Baltimore 2 up and Bloete won over"

.A,gills' varsity tennis
team,at Bucknell has been recently organized iii>der the leadei-ship of Professor Cyrus

campus.,"Hockey, ba.sketball, .softball, etc., have bee i .scheduled under a strictly inter-sor- ority sports program. The team will consist of eight women, and positions are to be filled according to the challenge ladder sys- tem. By this method of placing each girl on the team, anyone is granted the privilege to challenge the person immediately preceding her"
on,"the ladder. If the challenger wins his match, the other members automatic- ally move up one number on the lad- der. Four of the varsity will play fingies and the remaining four will |ilay both doubles and sin(fics. To date there are 20 girls on the ladder v<<hich is as follow.""?: Marjorie Clayton.

It was fortunate for the BLsons that they did so well in the track f vents, because they were outclassed i'l the field events, where Dickinson had a 2fi to 26 advantage. Dickinson v.on four of the six field event.s, while Gus Cadwallader, who won the pole vault, and Cy Trecartin who wvm the javelin, were Bucknell's only winner-: ill this department. The meet was not without its sur- prises. Ted Roselle, the Bi.sons' Frosh .'^print ace. scored a double victorv when he won both the 100 and 220 yard dashes. Roselle annexed an un- expected victory in the 100-yard da<<h, when he defeated Cap. Ray Armor by inches in a powerful, driving fini.sh."
A,"little later, Ro.selle won the 220 b> pbout a yard, in the good time of 22.8, to account for his double \nctory. If anyone had the idea that Armor was discouraged by his loss in the 100, they w^ere mi.staken. because th<< l.'inky blonde speedster returned to the track ir> minutes later and ran a fine race to win the 440 by 10 yard^ from his team mate Bob .Shaffer. .Shaffer also .sei""ved double duty to v.'in the half mile; but before he com- I>leted those 8S0 yards he had to do (|uite a bit of fancy stopping. ,Shaf- fir led until the last 220 yards, when I. en Smith of Dickinson challanged him and pas.se<l him on the last turn. .Smith held the lead until the two s\vei-\'ed off the turn into the straight- .nway.

CHAMPS,"With the spring intramural sports almost over, four events have al- rrady been claimed by the respective"
champs.,The horseshoe and quoit competition has been won by J. Par- kin. He took both events with a field that wa none too easy. The tennis windup
was,
won,"by *Tack Friedman. He defeated Sandy Finklestein in f^traight sets, 7-5 and *'2. Many of the scheduled matches were not played, therefore advancing many candidates through the forfeit procedure. Frif-dman played a hard, f.i.st game and was in command dur- ing the entire contest. In the archery tournament. Bob Mcintosh won this year's champion- .<;hip with little trouble. His eye wa.^ 1-een, and his aim was true. The golf matches are still being run off and the winner will be known soon. The septathlon is st-heduled for May 23 with many entries already i;i and more still to come, this event ir. going to provide many thrills and close competition throughout. As part of the immense Spring Festival program, the Bucknell coeds will have an opportunity to display their athletic prowess against the stronger sex. On Friday afternoon. May 0, amid the blaring of the band oftering the spirited Bucknell tunes, the S|)ri,ig Fe.stival of lf>41 will be initiated. The lads and lassies will take them- selves to the various corners and nooks of the campus and participate in one of the largest co-recreational programs ever witnessed on the Bucknell campus. Out on the rolling j;reens, the shuttlecock swatters will I'air off and see how it is to cooperate with the coeds, and vice versa, in bad- minton. Tennis will be another fea- ture of the program, and there's a possibility that it might turn out some men-beaters similar to Buffalo I'niversity's woman tennis star. The disciples of William Tell won't b- called upon to put an arrow thru an apple atop someone's head, but (he targets do have bulls eyes which <<an be pierced by the skilled archer. The tossing games, such as quoit.^ and hor8esh<<)es, will be another fea- ture of this grand co-recreational performance. It is hoped that the intramural baseball tournament will reach the semi-final stage by ,Satur<lay, May 10. therefore giving the parents an op- portunity to watch their sons go through their paces on the diamond. The committee is doing their ut- most to make the Spring Festival and Mother's Day a gala event on the ever-busy Bucknell Fportr program. by John Bush Bucknell's ba.seballors won their first game this year when they trounced Drexel at Memorial Stadium on Saturday, but that wasn't the big^ I news of the ball game. I The things that counted were Phil Stamm's superb mound work in al- lowing Drexel only three safeties and the gallant comeback of the Sitarsky- men after the Philadelphia's early one-run lead appeared as a safe mar<< gin of victory. Drexel's sole counter came in the second frame after Capt. Bob Clyde reached first on an error, moved to second via the illegal route and then bounced over the plate"
when,"Bud Landis singled into right field. In the fifth inning, Phil Stamm opened the Bi.son bat-barrage with a single. Stan Schilder hit a red-hot bounder to short.stop Landis who had difl[^culty in handling the pill and the Brooklyn mite reached first safely, Stamm moving all the way to thin! during the sequence. Schilder stole fecond but Stamm, one of Bucknell'e speedie.st diamond stars, rested com- fortably on the third-sack. Eugene Cook selected Hal Evans' initial offering and pasted it over the short left field fence for"
a,"double, driving in Stamm and Schilder. Tho Bisons in8ure<J victory by m wide margin in the eighth canto with three more runs. Bob Keegan's clout was go<jd for two bases and a few ^econds later he scampered home on V\'ill Ronk's sharp single to left field- Forrest Chilton, batting for Harry Reynolds, reached first base on an error. Both runners advanced a peg and then Stamm took his turn at bat. He lifted a high fly into left field and three Drexel ballplayers permitted the ball to drop to the turf. It wae an expensive error since Ronk and Schilder .scored on the miscue. Notes on the Game Coach Sitarsky's smile has return- ed and there's a healthy glow in hi<< cheeks^ all becau.se our Bisons won a"
game.,(P.
S.--,"The .skipper lost a pound with each Bucknell defeat; that's six lbs.) When the track handlers started to place the low hurdles on the cinder- path, which .splits the right and cen- ter gardens.

a,"Bison droppe<i a set, and no one was ex- tended beyond three games in any .set. Coach Ballentine employed a revamped lineup, in employing two newcomers on the team. Bill Carson ran through Jim McCord, 6-2, 6-0, and Freddy Griffin moved up a notch to dispose of George Bently, 6-0, 6-1. Bob Rink score<i a 6-2, 6-0 victory over Herold Mitman, while playing in the No. 3 position, and Joe Culbert- .""on made it 6-3, 6-1 over John Jones, their No. 4 player. Jim Edgar and Herb Wellus as.suined their varsity berths with great ease as they chalk- ed up two points for the Bisons. Jim took the toll of John Wal.<<>>h, 6-1, 6-1, ind Wells encountered little opposi- tion as he trounced Ray Kourtz, 6-1, 6-2. With five victories and but one de- feat under their belts, the Bi.son rac- queteers still have new fields to con- quer. On Wedne.sday, May 7, they met the Dickinson .squad, and on .Sat- urday, May 10, they come op against the highly touted Muhlenberg net- men, who boast some of the best in- tercollegiate players in Pennsylvania. by Hilda Lubliner The Detroit Tigers gave Hank Greenberg a watch at a dinner last Sunday night. On Wednesday he said goodby to his monkey suit and climbed into khaki. He may miss the Tigers during the summer, but that's nothing compared to how the Tigers will miss him. Handcuffed by"
OH,
Fox,"Griffith's i.o-trading rule, the Tigers would have had work enough trying to out- strip the Yankees and the Indians, but not only must they keep the>r creaking infield as-is, they must also bo bereft of their principle slugger. His going may also have a serious effect on Rudy York, the other half of Letroit's one-two"
punch.,"Many baseball people believe Rudy is one of those souls who must have a pace- setter to be proficient. Let Hank slug away in front of him, and he will also bang at the ball joyously, but take Greenberg out of there and York may have no one to emulate, cUid the loss of such a sterling ex- ample of how-to-bat- runs-in may ef- fect his own production. We"
COULD,"be all wrong again?, but Rudy doesn't impress us as being *<<n academically and scientifically mindetl player as is DiMaggio, who doesn't give one hoot about the No. 3 man just so long as there are Yanks on the bases. Rudy seems to revert back to the typical player of the Cobb era. Not too bright. Many of Cobb's teammates u.sed to think he was p.-*ychic merely because hf studiei every angle of the game in"

10.,"Frankly, we are not amused. Also like Victoria, we do not admit the possibility of defeat, but it would he nice if those two teams began to act just a bit more normally. .After idl, when we pick the Yankees and the Dodgers to win, teams like Cleve- land and St. I^uis can become very unpopular where we live. Watching the Reds thus far brings one to the conclusion that they ought to change their name to ""Walters"", and be done with it. Bucky i.<* the cnly man on the club"
who,"behaves like a World Champion. Even Ooin Paul has been getting himself slap- ped around. Of course, their main trouble is the lack of hitting, but even so, we know of"
many,second base combinations
we,"would take fver Frey and Joost, or whoever piays around there. In fact, that en tire middle line of catcher, second and short, and center field .seems ab- normally weak. Maybe Lombardi can hit some, but no one could call him a good catcher. In Brooklyn last week they lost three and won one only because Wal- ters refused to permit the Dodgers to take any liberties,,"
and,"he finally doubled in the eleventh to ultimate- ly score the winning inin. If they've got to beat the Dodgers to win, they aren't doing it. Mebbe that oh-.so- dark horse from St. Louis is the real competition but you can't overlook the fact that most of their 10 straight v/ere won by five rookies. No team can"
come,
up,"with five winnin;? rookies in one season. Human frail- ity and the law of diminishing re- turns set in before that. What should be fun is the series between Brooklyn and St. I>>uis in St. Ijouis (around exam time). If there's any place Durocher wants to win it's in St. Ix)o, because they are the boys who originally sent him down the river to Brooklyn They jn^t didn't know. Don Budge (remember?) has an iiounced his partial retirement from the pro tennis courts. He is going into the laundry business. Uh, huh. As befitting a man about to be mar- ried, he wants to enter the ranks of honest labor, and has bought out Frank Shield's half interest and now i.-T co-owner with Sidney Wood in the Budge-Wood Service, Inc. His an- nounced retirement could not be too much of a surprise, as everyone knew that he would be forced to quit be- cause of lack of competition. He has clefeated Perry and Tilden .so often nobody cares to watch,"
and,"Elly Vines is busy playing golf. However he will play in a pro tournament for British War Relief next month, and it will be better tennis than any of the amateurs can dish out. Which brings up the old question: When will they permit the pros to compete against the amateurs? They do it in golf, and no one has bee;i seriously contaminated. Defense note: Nobody goes to the ball games in Detroit any more be- cause everyone in town is working (or striking)."

Of,
Us,
All,"Bucknell, the foster mother of all Bucknellians, is hiRhly honored by the visitations of Bucknell motherB on this weekend. We ti-ust as vou witness, the unfoldinjf of your dreams, that you may recall the ""travail of vour soul and be satis'ied. No one but a mother knows the anguish, the vicarious sacrifices, and the anxiety for a child that will never bring reproach or sorrow to its parents. BucknHl frankly admits its inferiority complex in contrast with the filial affection )f the student body toward their blood-rrlated^ parents, but it makes no apolojry, whatever, once it has assumed a ma- jor role in their adult education. The preliminary role of a mother's affection and guidance and character building is a foundation pillar which determines the degree of success that Bucknell can import to her foster children. We acknowle<lge th's day, the inde.spen sable part that Pucknell mother's have dready contributed, and we promise on our part to carry on to greater perfection the task, so well begun by yourselves. Year in and year out the spirit of motherhoo<l of Bucknell watches over your sons and daughters and leads them on the path of achieve- ment and success. They are ac<)uiring characteristics of responsibil- ity and serious purpose, and before you will realize it, trey will be occupying important roles in life."

PAGE,"TIIREat by Betty Miles Since Spring Festival, Bucknell's last really big weekend has whirl- ed itself into a state of complete oblivion, we Bucknellians have settled down to what promises to be a comparative lull in the campus machine, pending the dawning of exam week, hanging over us in much the same manner as the pendulum over Mr. Poe'8 very black pit. But, being reso- lute optimists at all costs, let's turn the clock back to last weekend, when all was very rosy -- (in a purely literal sense) -- and take a look at Mother's Day Weekend -- '41. Delta Sigrma alumni brother James Duchinc, '40, who is now working at Heidclburg College, in Ohio, returned for Spring Festival weekend. John Koehlor, '44. visiteii Bloomsburg State Teachers' College over the weekend. Demies who were visite<l during the Mother's Day weekend by their parents and relatives included: Bob Fredrickson. Dick Nutt, I^s Whitney, Bill Carson, Don Hopkins, Harry Johnson, Don SchoU, Bill Con- ger, Al Ashman, Bill Hauk, Curt Clump, Bernie Hieber, and Bill Trick. More than thirty mothers, fathers, and friends were entertained at the Lambda Chi House over the weekend. Jim Schuessler, '42, and Yank Anderson, '42, visited their homes over the weekend. Bill Crum, '41, en- tertained Jean Levan, '40, over the weekend. Richard Hoser and John Galbraith spent the weekend at their respec- tive homes. Jay Palmer entertained his sister and brother-in-law over the weekend. Fred Michel, Lionel Sceurman, Joseph Bates, Arthur Schalick, I-xlwin Winkle, William Morton, and Henry Reiss entertained their parents over the"
weekend.,
^,"I-.ooks as if ""Bucknell-- 1941"" is fast becoming a memory. In three short weeks we'll trek home bag and baggage, with a whole year's work behind us, wondering, as usual, what all that time between September and June has done with itself. As  we freshmen look back, it seem.'^ a year packed so full with fun and excitement it would be next to impos- sible to stick a pin-head between the events as they occurred with ma- chine-gun rapidity. Phi Mu's Catheryn Ashman, '40, and Hilda Keyser, ex-'42, spent the weekend on campus. N'elle Dean, '42, visited in Harrisburg recently. Many parents, friends, and alumni spent the weekend at Sigma Al- pha Mu. I..enny Klein retumed last Wednesday from a prolonged week- end trip to Greenbrier College, located (of all places) in Lewisburg. West Virginia. Kappa Delta Rho held a Mother's Day bantiuet at the chapter houso Sunday noon. Over twenty parents were present."

With fraternity and .sorority .symposium looming very much in the foreground, and September plc<ige3 about to be converted into June ac- tives, another new group of green, gullible recruits step into the cate- Kor>- of the ""sea.soned Bucknellian"". We see new and quizzical faces <<)n campus, and find ourselves conjecturing as to what next year's crop of Bucknellians, now in the ""just visiting"" stage, will find on Bucknell's ""300 acres set apart"". Over 39 S."

This spring, a.s in almost every other, eyelet and seersucker materials r.re again popular. Sharkskin and silk-jersey are still good, and hand- kerchief linen has become a widely admired material for blouses.

Greek, calculus, and Latin are deft- nitely not the only accomplishment* which one may attribute to the aver- age Bucknell coed. This is evidenced by the engagement"

"READY,",
GET,
SET--,"With the announcement a fortnight Ago of actual figures proposed as the 1942 surtax on incomes, many a fur- row creased the brows of heretofore eptimistic June graduates. The odds just are not with them. Granted that one manages to be overlooked in the calling of draft numbers and can then secure a rea- Konably profitable job, the chances of beginning a bank account and achiev- ing a semblance of nonchalance about life and its financial problems are not Ifood -- the treasury department will get a large proportion of what goes into the pay envelopes. Striking particularly at the low- bracket incomes, taxes in these cate- gories will take from two to six times as much as in previous years. On a $1,500 income, the present sur- tax is $22, the proposed surtax will be $109. The increase in this cate- gory, next to the lowest for single persona, is four and one-half times greater than the present rate. Serious times are ahead for every- body. It remains for all college stu- dents to prove the value of educa- tion. Optimism will be a vital factor in their success."

1,In cool prison cells of gloom ' ?mall black ghosts of misty night Pull me down to endless doom Singing memories of flight. From the shades and dewy veils. By a moonlit dusted sky My poor heart in terror fails And my soul from life must fly.
A,thin flame of litiuid fire In the east of sullen grays.
A,"pale morning .star her lyre Of gay golden sunbeams plays. The cool night now melts away. And my heart and soul are freed, As the dawning sun of day In her glorj- saves my creed."
I,By Dene Elizabeth Gracey. by Bob
Lambert,"| Three of-Decca's latest albums are .\orthy of note. Number 216 is an anthology of drum exhibitions, some good, and some just fair. Some of the better known drummers featured are Ray Bauduc, Frank Carlson, Gene Krupa,"
Ray,"McKinley and Zutty h'ingleton. Out of the ten sides in- cluded in the album, six are really excellent, portraying taste as well as techni(iue, and the rest are just a lot of banging. An album entitled ""One O'Clock Jump"" features the 12 best sides that the Count Basie Orchestra made on IVcca Records -- at least Decca says they're the best. They were all inad<< when Basie was in his prime at any rate, but sidps like Bluen In The Dark and Out  The Window shouldn't hav.; been omitted (Decca album No. 218). The best of the lot is No. 201-- the second in a series including re- issues of Parlophone records issued abroad in 1936. There are four sides by Gene Krupa's Chicagoans, four by Bunny Berigan's Blue Boys, two by Pete Brown's Jump Band, and two j.iano solos by Jess Stacy. The Kru- pa and Stacy sides are best-- in fact they're unbelievably good, but not one note on any side is really had."
WOODY,
HERMAN,"-^ Chloe and Let's Get Away From It All (Decca 3712). Woony's vocal highlights the Chloe side, and Muriel Lane's vocal much to spoil the other side. Th<< band still calls itself ""the band that I lays the blues"" but it hasn't made a really good blres record for months. It's true that Chloe is melancholy, but i^'s not blues. If the public want* to hear Woody as he is now instead of hearing real blues such as the band is capable of playing it seems that public opinion is about to kill another good band."
JOE,
MARSALA--,"Bull's Eye and Slow Down (Decca 3715). This is Joe Marsala's first appear- pnce on Decca Records with his band, and may his contract never expire. Listen to Dave Tough's drums on liuH's Eye; Adele Girard's harp and Joe's clarinet on both sides. It's the l-.'nd of stuff that comes much too F^eldom."

Fire,
Down,
Below,Just a
few,nights
ago,there
was,
a,
devastating,fire
here,in
town,that left a desolate pile of
smoldering,
ruins,
out,
of,
what,had
been,a large and
prosperous,business
concern.,
Years,of toil and effort
have,
gone,into building this
enterprise.,
The,firm has a position of repute
and,
dignity,in the
commercial,
realm,of the
community.,
Then,early in the
morning,a
tiny,
blaze,
broke,
out,
some-,where in the
building.,It
was,"only a flickering,"
creeping,finger of fire
and,
smoke,"at first, but it"
slowly,
spread.,
An,
alarm,
was,
sounded,
and,
from,
sleeping,
households,
emerged,the
Lcwisburg,
Volunteer,
Firemen.,
These,civic
minded,citizens serve the best interests of both their
community,
and,their fellow
men,
by,turn- ing out
any,time of
night,or
day,"to aid in quelling fires,"
and,as- sisting in
time,of
disasters.,Activities
such,
as,
these,
always,
have,
been,in the
American,tradition
--,
doing,one's best for those
who,
need,help.
A,small
group,of
sympathetic,
on-lookers,
gathered,
as,the fire
gained,
headway,
and,flames licked out the
windows.,
The,"spectators,"
mostly,
"youngsters,",and
men,
who,
were,
attempting,"to help the firemen,"
pressed,closer to the
biiilding.,
Then,
an,ex- plosion rent the smoke-filled air
and,
the,
peace,
of,
a,
Sunday,
morning,in
May,
was,
broken,
by,the
crashing,"of glass, the"
sound,"of falling bricks,"
and,the
dreadful,
thunder,as a three story wall
crumbled,into the
titreet.,
Out,of the v/ild
confusion,that fol- lowed came the toll ;
two,
dead,
and,
twenty-one,
injured--,yet all of the
victims,
were,
present,out of a sincere
and,
worthy,desire to help.
Have,
we,a
moral,
here?,
Have,
we,a parallel to this
com-,munity tragedy? If
you,care to think
about,"it, there is a paral- lel and a serious one,"
which,
must,
be,
faced,
with,
strength,
and,fortitude.
In,
Europe,the inferno-like fires of
war,are
blazmg.,
We,
cannot,
watch,our fellow
men.,thus
"engaged,",
with,indifference
and,
lassitude.,
A,large
portion,of the
youth,in
American,col- leges and universities are
against,
any,
volunteer-firemen,
work,
away,
from,our
own,
shores.,
Other,
groups,violently assert that
we,
must,go
abroad,to stop it.
There,is a decision
which,
must,be
made,
by,
each,of us. as individuals;
made,
slowly,
and,
with,
deliberation.,
But,"like the gallant, sincere"
men,
who,tried to help their
neighbors,at the fire here in
"town,",
we,
must,not
wait,until
the,
entire,structure ex- plodes and our walls of state
tumble,
down.,
A,fire wall
kept,the
Lewisburg,fire
from,
spreading,to the rest of
town;,our national
defense,
program,
aims,
at,
a,similar goal as
regards,the foreign
situation.,
There,is no
time,to get
"emotional,",
more,
than,ever
we,
must,
remain,logically
minded.,
We,
must,"think for ourselves,"
and,
when,our
minds,are
made,"up, abide"
by,our convictions.

I,"Register to universities and colleges concerned with instruction in this I J hase of psychological experinienta- \ tion. Work of producing the movie was in charge of L. Francis Lybarger, di- rector of admission.'* and alumni sec- retary  at Bucknell. Dr. Milton"
H.,", Krickson, noted p.sychiatri.st from the : Ivloise Hospital in Michigan, and Dr. Philip L. Harriman. professor of psy- . chology at Bucknell, originated the I idea for the film. They also created I the ""set"" and arranged for the ; "".'-hootinR"" of the scenes and action. I The entire .'>()0-foot film i.-< colored in order to distinguish the chromatic colors, such as reds, greens, etc. from the achromatic colors, including blark and white. Dr. Erickson and Dr. Harriman are seen in the movie which has as it""? (ther main characters, Le.Anne Boyle, a Bucknell student from P'reeland, and Gladferd Machamer, Bucknell gra<iuate and a resident of I.^'wis- V.urg. The action for the film was entire- 1;. unrehearsed. Dr. Harriman per- f iniied the hypnosis, and Dr. Erick- son tested Miss Boyle for red-green Mindness. While in the state of complete am- nesia.  Miss Boyle had l>een told she would forget everything imparte<i to her by the operator, but the film dem- j onstrates that the suggestions of ; color-blindness presented by Dr. Har- rman carrie*i over when Mis.*; Boyle j awakened and attempted to solve the i teat of worsteds as administered bv j Dr. Erick.son. I The subject confused grays with I f^reens, grays with blues, and browms j v>>ith reds. It is supposed that red- preen blindness is cau.sed by some deficiency in the i-etina, but the Buck- nell   movie presents evidence that i such a condition may })e brought .'.bout by suggestion. A test for ' Kreen and red blindness is al.Ho in- (ruded in the motion picture."

ATIOX,">^'aNhingtun May 9, llMl. Fd. note: This is a portion of a letter Kent to President MartH and it's contentH are pertinent to the .stu- dent  body here at Bucknell. We publi^4h it in the hope that every student will heed it's mesHage. To University and ColleRe Presidents: 1 wish to .>^y an additional word to your students. This has to do with the tendency of students to en- roll in .short defense training courses iiustead of completing their regular college curricula. The defense train- ii'g program operates under the jur- isdiction  of this ofllice. I therefor"" have a keen interest in the effective- res of the program. It should bo said, however, that the demand of in- dustry for fully trained professional personnel in all fields related to na- tional defen.se is already greater than the supply and the need for these fully trained men is going to be greater with the pa.ssing years. It would be a mistake, therefore, for a student who is competent to complete a full college course which i.^ related closely to defense to drop out of that course and complete some short course in order to engage in in- dustrial employmen at less than a full jirofessional level. The first ob- ligation of college students is to fit themselves for the highe.st type of service; they should not give up the chance to prepare for their unique Sfrvice in order to render a service on a level which can be rendered by a much larger number of men and"

American',"All our life we have observed our democratic institutions at work. In so far as they -ire operated by a civil service personnel we have been impressed by their efficiency and courte.sy and usefulness to the state. Many political appointments, to serve in a government emer- gency, are truly fine offsprings of the democratic way of life. Some politicians and patronage peddlers and party convictions with a cash value, are nothing more than millstones tied to the neck of democracy. What we think of them would please Hitler a lot. On one occasion we watche<l the Federal Immigration Depart ment function, with intelligent and well-c|Ualified officers in charge. We noted the careful observance of the various immigration laws, and the concern and kind consideration given to each applicant for .Ameri- can citizenship. The standards and restrictions are hij,'h indeed, and good American stock will seldom be depreciated by foreign matter. Unfortunately, many fine candidates are excluded by quotas and false sii.spicions and endless red tape, and they who would contribute a rich vein to the wealth of democracy are banned and lost to us. We seem to prefer perpetuating some poor American stock rather than take a chance with new blood. These convictions have been forced on us by visits to several insane and fer'bleminded institutions. Why, in the name of common .sense and religion and democracy .should we allow those tragic I-Q's of the insane, the imbecile, and the niorrtn to perpetuate them.selves is l)eyond us. We are making some progress, but like the State Liquor Store victims, we are making them faster than we can save them. These biological monstrosities are of slight use to themselves or  to the world. They are a constant problem to s()ciety and a huge expense for our democratic taxpayers to meet. The only justification that religion can give for the perpetuation of such breeds is perhaps the value of human personality. We aometimes wonder if normal intelligence isn't hard on some kinds of religion. They are not quite so gullible, and the disappearance of some of the morons might coincide with the passing of some churches, hardly worth perpetuating. If we can kill two birds with one stone, what's the"
harm?,"Pure religion and democracy will be the ones to gain. For God has not given us the mental age of a moron, but of power and love and a sound mind."

Bisons,"by Joe Barber Hay Armor, captain of Bucknell's track team,  has won a lot of races in the second set, 6-0, but he couldn't seem to keep up the pace and finally fell C>-Z. Johnny Oonk celebrated a three- Bet victor>' over Overcash. The In- dian No. 2 man downed John in the initial set, 7-5. The second round, though, i^howed a reversal of form aa Cronk came out on top, 0-4. Then the Bison captain displayed some preat tennis in winnine the last set, 6-0. Bob Rink assumed the No. % slot with a 7-9, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Stonifer, and Dan Richardson showed some of his old form in trouncinjf Fisher in straight sets by the tune of 6-3. 6-2. Joe Culbertson followed Danny's example and took a straight set vic- tory over Cooper, 6-3, 0-4. Playing hia second varsity match. Jim Kdgar put up a great tussle but just didn't seem to have enough to come out ahead of Rosenborg. The Dickin.son netman emerged on top, 7-f), 6-4 after experiencing some really stubborn epposition. Bow to Muhh'nberg The score read 6-.3 in favor of Muh- lenberg as our netmen stepped off th* courts. The highly touted Mule out fit ran true to form, and exhibited 6ome of the best tennis seen on the Bucknell courts. Despite the over- whelming odds, the Bison racquete<>>i<< put up a great battle and threw quitp a score into their opponents before the match was over. Score Second Win Over F. &"
M.,"The Franklin and Marshall court- men, still smarting from their 7-2 de- feat at the hands of the Bisons, camo to the Bucknell courts on Monday de- termined to change the picture. The Mze of the frame was decreased, but the picture told the same story -vic- tory for Bucknell. The Diplomats really made it closo this timp, but as the sun was going down. Rink and Fdgar walked off the courts with a victory tucke<l under their belts, thus giving the Bisons a .'i to 4 advantage. The singles matches ended in a 3-3 tie, the absence of Captain .Johnny Cronk being .sorely felt. Carson and Griffin gavo the Bisons a 4-.1 lead by downing Kirk and Bachman, 6-4, .5-7, C-2 in the doubles. But the score read 4-4 before long, as a result of the 8-6, 6-2 victory chalked up by Nicholas"
and,Anderson over the Richardson-Culbertson combination. Win Deciding .Match It was a dramatic scene as Bob Rink and Jim Edgar took the court to tackle Barber and Honoman. The outcome of the match was in their hands. The boys showed fine form in taking the first set 0-3. The F'. &

The price on .Soose <>iulden1y jumped sky-high"
a,"few fiours before the fight. Overlin's manager went to the judges and de- roanded fairness. Jaime Powers of he New York Daily News said that all he knew was that if Soose had lost, a lot of gamblers' money would tiave gone down the drain. It was filso a terrible fight from a fistir fltandard, so what the heck? We say rematch them in a dark alley and let Penn State's tru.stees keep score. Wa are still waiting for Billy Conn and Joe Louis to play catch. The baseball campaigns are going along sedately, with Brooklyn fight- ing it out with Cincinnati and trust- ing their ol' pals, the Giants, to take care of the Cards. Talking about the Cards last year Breaden and Rickey fired Ray Blades because the pitching staff complained about work- ing every day, and brought back Billy fiouthworth. That Billy is doing a 6uperb job so far no one (us) can i'.eny, but there are times when we believe that he takes the afternoon itff and lends Blades his uniform and liis authority. For, to be subtle, once in a while Mr. Southworth can come up with more pitching changes in one game than Blades ever dreamed of. (Could be that he has a larger staff. Cleveland went into the Yankee gtadium leading the league by a com- fortable margin, as far as Spring margins go. There they met Mass.i McCarthy's charges."

This was the first appearance of the seniors in their official academic dress which they wore during the re.st of the day and which they will wear later during commencement week. Ray Armor, president of the class of 1941, conducted! the chapel exer- cises and introduced the senior class bpeakers, Margaret Symington, Ray Underwood, and Robert Thonia.% all of whom spoke on their observations of Bucknell through their four years and what they have meant to them.

omen,"Dean Dyer met with the 1941-1942 dormitory coun.selling groups Mon- day, May 12, at a dinner in her home to discuss counselling plans for the coming year. Plans concerning the contacting of the prospective fresh- n'an"
women,"during the summer months by the counsellors, the ap- pointment of commmittees for cozies x.hich will be conducted to aid the freshmen to become better acclimat- ed, and the general counselling set- up, were covered by the group. This year's ""Etiquette Book"", which is sent in the .summer to all in-coming fresh- man women, will be illustrated by .Ann Randle, '42, a counsellor for the c< niing year. .A new cover for the ""Etiquette Book"" has also been de- s^igned by Miss Randle. Doris Wiegand, '42, will .ser^*e as pssLstant hostess next year, and will thus automatically become a member of the cotmselling group. Mrs. Cor rm, hostess at liarison Hall, and Mis-t Henry, hostess at Senior House, are also included in the counselling grou,) which is under Dean Dyer's supervis- ion. The following women will act a.^"

next,"year. Both hou.<<es are being thoroughly lenovated, and will harbor sixteen pirls each. This step was necessitated by the f.'^.ct that the number of paid applica- tions for admission to women's col- lege .iso far exceeded the number of available accommodations. The Uni- \ersity received twice as many paid applications as it was possible to ac- cept under the present conditions. In view of this fact, the present addi tions to the women's housing quar- ters were"

A,"new kin<l of com, developed by Dr. Eyster, has just been put into production. The yielding capacity of this com promi.<>>es to bo double that of the ordinary, becau.se of several of its characteristics. Its most outstanding characteristic is that it has three .stalks instead of the usual one, and for this reason Dr. Kyster has named i* Tri-Culm Corn. To explain more fullv, from one ker- iicl of this corn three stalks appear. ^*#herea8 with other kinds of com one l.emel produces but one stalk. The leaves of thi.s new corn are also di.^tinctive because of their size. The usual corn leaf is from three to four inches wide. These leaves arc up to six inches wide. This of cours^* is a very goo<l feature since, by its larger size, the leaf can absorb more : unlight and hence stimulate greater Rrowth. TTiis Tri-Culm Corn has a terrific loot system. Its roots grow deep enough down in the soil to make the llanl drought -resistant. The root system is much larger and more in- tricate than the ordinary. It en- trenches the plant so strongly in the .'oil that the stalks will not blow down. Development of Corn Interesting The history of the development of this Tri-Culm Com is very interest- ing. It Is a hybrid between two in- l reds. Inbreeding and .selecting were carried on for twenty years. At the < nd of this time there were fifteen or 'wenty pure lines. These were inter- crossed until seventy-eight kinds of hybrids appeared. From these seven- ty-eight, the Tri-Culm Com was se- lected as the best. Different men in the vicinity have experimented with it. Two years ago Bechtels grew it and found it yielded three times as much as their former crops. Mr. C. Groover, Lewisburg lawyer, planted it on a fourth of an acre and from this area harvested sixty bushels. This year for the first time it is 1-emg put in production.

Exam,
Time,
Jitters,"It is about at this time of the year, all over the country, that the youth of America suffer from a dreadful malady, worse than .spring fever in jts far reaching consequences. Un- fortunately people on the college level d.^n't seem to realize that final exam- inations are the natural course of events following in tho wake of a se- mester of classes. It is rather lamentable to find such a state of affairs among a group of people who spend most of their time convincing their elders that they are really adults. F.xam time jitters are nothing more than an upset state of mind over varying amounts of work left undone. The ner\'ous state of the individual u.sually correlates with the number of books to be read be- fore finals. There is nothing wrong however, in being genuinely concerned over one's studies. Thi.s i.s as it should be. VThtit we are referring to is the hap- iiiuiticmiit?, ariows mS worn lo i-eacn Buch mountainous proportions that finals creep up on him and he is faced with a studying schedule that no mor- tal could possibly complete. This student is not only a mfnace to himself, but a bother and a nui.**- ance to his friend.*. Having seen and heard about others of hia own kind, he conforms to the .standards set for cramming for an examination."
He,"is the one who takes cold showers on the hour, every hour of the night to keep awake; he is the one who turns on the radio at .3 a. m. because it helps him to relax; and he l.s the one who reduces the rest of his companions to nervous hysteria by running around memorizing out loud. This type of behavior is childish, i.nd according to psychologists, ab- solutely useless. The name exhibi- tionist is the only title that can be applied to a .student of this calibre. It is likely to be difl^cult to concen- trate and be calm in times such as these, but concentrate we mnst, and calmness will help us."

18.,"The picnic wa>> at- tended by some fifty students, who oPt out from Bucknell Hall at 3:00 o'clock Sunday afternoon. The pic- nickers played baseball in the after- I oon, working up appetites for their picnic supper. Following this a Devotional Ser\'ice was held around the campfire. Two high spots of the service were the freshman women's sextet, and the discussion which was led by Dwight ISiilleman, '42, adviser for the council. During the discussion the group loniinisced over events of the past year, and attempted to look ahead into the future. Dr. George Gregory acted as chap- erone. Sy Richards and Bill Benner iieaded the committee, assisted by Margaret Meston. Mary Louise Tripp, Kill Schnure, and Louis Haug, all of the class of '44."

The loss came after the BLsons had split two road engagements, downing Ivebanon Valley, 9 to 4, and losing to Gettysburg, 6 to 2, in a duo of Kast- cin Pennsylvania Collegiate tilts. Against the Owls, Bucknell capi- talized on the unsteady backstop work of Fddie Valyo who had three passed balls credited to him in the first inn- ing.

WORX.S.,"INc"" and freshman Rill Heim should give Coach Merle Edwards a pretty good squad this fall. BA.SKETBALIy -- Bucknell's basketball squad of this past .season, though off to a weak start, finishe<l very strong winning their last four league con- tests in fine fa.shion. High .scorer for the team was Sophomore George Haines, who also placed second in the I^eague scoring. Kd Glass' 6 ft. 4 in. played a vital part in the Bi.'ions' game around the bat-kboards, Freddy Fahr- inger's shiftiness, .Nipper Nolan's steadiness, Joe Biizas' spirit, and Albie Baker's .set shots, made this Musser team a real threat throughout the sea- son, and ended them up in a tie for second place in their league. Pro.spects for next year are good with Haines, Glass, and Fahringer returning, and the addition of Bob Keegan from the Frosh squad. Lost through graduation will be Nolan, Buzas, Baker. Ray Armor, and Johnny McElhany."
BOXING,"-- Joe Reno's boys, though they finished their sea.scm in the ring with two wins, two ties, .ind a pair of losses, provided many an exciting mo- ment for Bison .sports fans. The two boys who particularly shone for Buck- nell in the ring this year were the G-men, Frankie Garro and .Mai-\- Gerla. . T3i<< former went through six matches without a loss, while the latter after losing his first match of the year won his next five via the knockout route. The team was hard hit by the loss of their great heavyweight, George Boner. midway through the carnpaigji. His place, however, was capably filled by Johnny McP'.Ihany. .Another good performer for the Renomen was Captain Art Kleindien.st in the 127-lb. division. .Art and Earl Grose will be the only losses from next year's team. The five returning veterans .should give Joe Reno something real good to work on for next year."
B.A.SEBALL--,"Lo.sing their first six contests of the current campaign, things certainly looked mighty woeful for Johnny .^itarsky's boys a few wetjks ago. However, since that sixth loss the boys have been coming along At a very much improved pace. Though they are still no world-lx'aters, they are now, at least, winning their share of ball game.-*, having won four of their last six games. Two freshmen have proven to be the sparkplugs of the team. Bob Keegan's long hitting and fine fielding at shortsto]), and Phil Stamm's fine pitching, which has won all four of the games, have made them invaluable newcomers to Johnny's squad. .Another consistent hitter for the Bisons has been second ba.seman Willard Ronk. Prospects for this team next year are probably the best of any team, with the whole squad with the ex- ception of ""Nipper"" Nolan returning for action. TR.\CK -- Highlights of this year's track sea.son was the great perform, ance turned in by Captain Ray Armor, Bob Shaffer. Dave Culp. and Bob Sny- der in the Penn Relays. The team has thus far won three meets while losing two. Surpri.se of the year has been the exceptionally fine running of fresh- , man Ted Roselle in the sprint events. Next year's prospects for Coach John i Plant's team, however. :ire not too cheerful. Lost by graduation will be the irreplacable Ray Armor, Bob Snyder, Dave Culp. Charlie Schreiber, and Frank Serrao. I^^ading the s<iuad next year will be Bob Shaffer and Ted ' Roselle, aided considerably by Gus Cadwallader, Cy Trecartin, Earl Thomas, and Carl"

TENNIS,"-- Next to the golf team, the Bison ractjuet-wielders have proven to be the most successful of Bison teams of the year. At the pre.sent tint"" : they possess a reconl of nine wins as again.st but two los.ses. Most consist- ent winner for  the team has been southpaw Bob Rink.

W mrtially self-supportmg. .Maryland, Rutgers, and Dickinson, and tied one of the outstanding teams of the East, the V. of Balti:nore. Only two more matches remain between this team and an all-win 8ea.son. Delaware and Coniell. the latter bein|r the cru- cial test. Pacing this fine squad have been the two Bills, Johnson and Ra- mage.      Right behind the.se two aces come five more fine shooters, Johnny Britton, Wilbur Bloete, Ross Jackman, Herni Fritz, and Bud Vanderbilt. Thi pntspects for next year are only fair, as the cap and gown will take from the ranks of this team Johns(m, Bloete, and Jackman. Well, thnre you have a review of Bi.son sport doings of the past year. However, before closing, a word should be said about that part of the Buck-"
I,"nell Athletic progam which plays such an interesting and exciting part in the activities of about tJOO Bucknell males year in an<l year out, the very fine intramural program. This year's intramural competition was almost com- pletely dominated by the Sigma Chis and the Kappa Sigs, with the Big Red nosing out the Sigs for the all-year intramural trophy by the scant margin of 5.5 or 10.5 points (dependent on the outcome t)f the baseball final between the Kappa Sigs and Phi Gams). It was a bitter pill for the Sigma Chis to swallow, losing out on this prized award in such a manner after they had led the field for the entire year, but the Kappa Sigs, who put up a great showing in the last three sports of the year, basketball, volleyball, and ba.seb><<ll. must have found their success sweet revenge for the manner in which they lost out on the all-year trophy la.st year. However, the Sigs with a great freshman class coming up should make things very interesting in the intramural ranks for the next three years."

This means that those students who Attend Bucknell University can quali- fy as professional chemists after only two years in the industry, or grad- uate school, following receipt of their degree here, while students who at- tend un-accredited institutions are re- quired to complete five years of addi- tional training after frraduation."
The,committee
on,"Professional Training of Chemists, who made the announcement, is a group set up by the American Chemical Society to establish standards"
for,"training; these standards to be u.sed as a basis of reference in the accrediting of ed- ucational institutions and in promot- ing the work of preparing young men and women for careers in the field of chemistry. Department Here Ranks IliKh The Department of Chemistry here not only meet.^ the standards of this accrediting committee, but it al.so has a chemistry curriculum that provi<lrs eiectives in either of two major fields jf Chemistry the Junior year, ll i? in this year that the student can elect to  do his major work in the field of physical or inorganic chemistry or in the field of organic and biological chemistry. This curriculum a!.so pro- vides a unique opportunity for those #who are qualified to do a research problem in the field of his major in- terest. Any student who follows this sequence of courses is qualified for a position in the chemical industries or for graduate study in the various schools. Out of the 1,586 colleges and uni- versities in the United State."", only 102 have been thus far accredited. This places the academic standing of the Bucknell Chemistry Department in the upper seventh percent of all the Universities in the country."

Deferment,"Ed. Note: Because out of 892 of the men at Bucknell. 240 are registered in the draft and 113 will be eligible in June. ""The Bucknellian"" prints this message from President .Marts to the >jtudent body. His re- marks aK to remaining in .school to get every semester of education are extremely important. May 17, 1941. Office of the President We have recently received word from the .""Selective Service Headquarter^ which indicates that some men now in college and .subject to the draft may be found more useful to (he nation in certain professions and occupation* than in (he military service. I am sending you this letter so that, if you are preparing for one of these essential occupations, <<e may help you apply for draft deferment, if you so desire. General Hershey, who is in charge of the .Elective Service draft, has re- cently issued a statement to the effect (hat replacemen's for certain import- ant occupations and professions are ""at a dangerously 'ow level."" Because of this situation it is very important that students who are now preparing for the various fields of engineering, den(is(ry, pharmacy, physics, medicine, biol- ogy, bacteriology, geology, geo-physic.s, meteorology, hydrology, cartography, and for any other fields considered to be ""essential to the national health, .safety, or interest"" should continue their work at college. Bucknell students who are in preparation for such occupations may apply for occupational deferment in the draft. This must be done with (he cooper- a(ion of the Bucknell adminis(ra(ion, and I have uppoin(ed a faculty commit- tee of which Dean Page is chairman, to consider and endorse all applications for deferment which aitpear to fall within the in(en( of this new communica- tion, liocal draf( boards have been no(ified by national headquar(ers to give due attention (o such endorsemen(s from Bucknell and o(her colleges. i am enclosing a memo which gives de(ails as (o how yon should proceed, if you desire to apply for occupational deferment. I am sending a copy to your parent (or guardian) so (his new provision reKardinir some collene men and (he draf( may be comple(ely understood. It is an extremely important provision -- important to the nation and to the individual -- and"
I,"trust yau will give this your most careful attention. We are in one of (he most dangerous periods in (he history of our Repah- lie. We mHs( all do our u(most in service to the nation, where each of us can serve best. Our government at Washington is making the plans and this new communication indicates (hat they feel the need for (he service of many college men in indus(ry and certain professions. I hope each Bucknell man will continue to get every semester of educa- tion here he possibly can. until he is draf(ed. and Ihat (hen each of us will give his utmost in whatever form of .service the nation decides to summon him. M'ith kind penwnal regards. Yours sincerely, Amaud C. .Marts, Presiden(."

Of,
Entire,
Year,"Bucknell's Summer School, in fifteen years' time has grown as much a.s the entire college did in the first sixty years of her life. The .'itudent btxiy of college level and graduate study i.s of approximately the Kame number as the college proper, in one-fourth the time. Her iwautiful flowers and shrubbery and trees and spacious lawns and winding paths put their best foot forward and keep it there longer than at any other time of the year. The atmosphere of schola.stic attainment and the best incentives for serious study are ever pre.sent in our summer faculty. Many of our guest professors are distinguished in their own fields, and a con- .stant joy in their social relations. .Among them, Prof. Melchior, of Girard College, is an out.standing authority on pedagogy, and a contin- ual fea.st to his student.s and friends. Frank Smigelsky, Head of the Department of Mathematics in the Syracuse public schools, and George Robinson, of Rutgers, are both old timers in our summer school, and both very popular with all of their .""students. Their informal and spontaneous bull ses.sions are never-ending, and always delightful oc- casions. ""Betty"" Humphreys, now in double harness, is one of our Ijitin teachers who tries to be dignified and is largely unsuccessful be- rause of her irrepressible mirth and joy in living. Carl Millward. Su- perititendent of the Milton schools, i.s one of our greater assets whose ability and fine character is everywhere recognized. .Added to all of these guests and many more are the cream of our own regular faculty. Dr. Frank Davis, founder of the Bucknell .Funior College and supervisor of all our extension courses is the efficient hea<l of our Summer School. His textbooks tm pedagogy and his wide- .xpread ac(|uaintance among teachers throughout the state is a great asset to our graduate students and to the ever-widening influence of Bucknell. For those students subject to the draft, one or two sessions in Summer School will complete the required work for a degree, which would othenvise drag on indefinitely, and it is always embarassing to have to explain or apologize for a missing degree almost within our While recreation and amusements are ample, Bucknell's Summer School attend.s to business. Those multiplying and often short-lived organizations that fill our L'Agendas, those thieves and distractions of Greek alphabetical .soup, are all missnig. Hut Summer School begetf* .*students and scholars, and accomplishes more in less time than any ..ther time of the year. There is no room for the playboy or for the student constantly' hampered by Greek hunlles. An ideal mixture of young and older students march along in perfect stej), with the .stabil- ity of the one harmonizing with the enthusiasm of the other. Weather conditions are almost ideal, sleeping tinder blanket.* most of the time. >vith all the cool breezes inherent in our hilltop location. The Bucknell Summer School bids you come. In such troublesome times, these op- portunities may easily suffer an eclipse. Procra.stination may quickly lob you of an education. Now is the day of assent and the dotted line."
