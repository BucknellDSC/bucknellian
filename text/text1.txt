At no time jn the intelleetual de-
velopment of the citizens of our
country has the ‘obligation of the
college and University towards poll-
ties been so great, The guidance of
the Ship of State is in the hands of
men who have tried to sense public
opinion in order to make fair and }
equitable decisions in matters of pub-1
lie policy. This has always been go in
our country and is the secret of the
permanence of the Nation. Puble
opinion is largely generated by the
attitude of men for whom the great
masses of people have sincere admi-
ration and unqualified respect, How
many men who mold pubHe opinion
are products of or are at present Iiv-
ing’ in our great colege communities?

John Erskine.in “The Moral Obli-
gation to the Intelligent'’ would have
those of us who have been trained
at great cost to our familes, our-
selves, or Univerflty Endowments,
return in some measure, the results
of that training to the community in
which we tive—the Nation to whieh
we owe allegiance. This Nation de-
mands of us that we bear arms in
time of war; Why can it not demand
that we use our minds -in time of
peace? There is a vast fund of evi-
denee for and against the League of
Nations, There are many minds
whose mental convolutions are not
affected by evidence nor by the dig-
ging into the propaganda or truth,
(as the ease may be behind if.) Prop-
aganda is not always a whole eoth
of lies, but its orfgin does not be-
speak its sincerity.

It is part of the training of the
College University man to be in a
position to make his decision on the
basis of the facts in the case, What
those facts are can only be found
by a clear analytleal study of the
causes, the oceasions and the events
which have led up to the erisis be-
fore us in the settlement of the
greatest war the world ever engaged
itself in. For what? For aggrandize-
ment, for imagined wrong, for com-
mercial supremacy of a group of
Nations, for reprisal on a war-erazed
foe—no, none of these but for the
purpose of preventing future wars in
this world of ours where men might
live together in peace, in perpetuat-
ing great constrnetive enterprises,
livinv as God wished his children to
live.

Do College Men think? Yes, college
men are capable of thinking. Are
they thinkink in this political erisis
when the world’s seenrity rests on 2
preference in Presidential candidates
in one country? Unless they do, there
is little hope that the rest of the
vast electorate will receive from the
University and College communities
any help, only guidance in making
this Nation’s Great Deeision.

this Fall, in whieh the present mem-
bers of the society, alone, will take
part.

‘PROWANT GIVES
TEAM BLANKETS

Among the thousands of Bucknell
enthusiasts, there has always been
manifested an almost unanimous in-
clination to improve our athletie de-
partment. The attempts to assist have
as a rule tuken the form of advise
and criticism of those in charge. It
is very significant that the volumes
of advise and criticisms, given and
heeded in the past, have effected the
effielency and strength of the Ath-
letic organization very very little.
And consequently, while thoge in
charge appreciate the value of intelli
gent advice and construetive eriti-
eism ,and welcome them, they, do not
value their effectiveness very highly,
and feel very certain that as a gen-
eral rule the only way to really help,
to improve our athleties is by muat-
terial contribution,

Among our friends in Lewtsburg,
there is one mun at least who shares
this view with the authorities ,and
who has always aeted accordingly.
This is John F. Prowant,
known as ‘Johnny on the Corner.”
In the dim past when‘ Bueknell foot-
ball players had to sit and shiver
when not in the play, Johnny was In-
strumental in raising a fund, among
the members of the old Lewisburg
Club, to provide them with blankets,
When funds were needed to secure
the canvas which now encloses our
field, Mr. Prowant was ready with |
his share. In every instance in whiecl
any funds of any kind were solicited
from-him, he was “Johnny on the |
spot,” and several contributions have |
come from him without any solefta-
tion whatever. It was therefore not
at all surprising, although it was a
very pleasant surprise, when just be-
fore the game last Saturday, a set of
eleven new foot hall blankets were
presented to the Athletic AssocStion,
with the compliments of John F.
Prowant and Son. /

It is a great pleasure to acknow-
ledge this gift and to express, thro
these columns, the heartlest appre-
ciation of Mr. Prowant's thoughtful-
ness and Hberality in furnishing this
mueh needed equipment, And in this
grationus acknowledgement we are
sure that we are voleing the senti-
ment of the entire student body, the
{faculty and the alumni.

“CHIC” FLORIN INTRODUCES
SOME NEW YELLS AND ASKS
FOR BETTER SUPPORT

Cheering practiee last week on the
Athletic field developed several per-
tinent points concerning that fmpor-
tant phase of all the games: namely,
cheering our teams on to victory.
Cheer leader Florin reallzcs this ne-
eessity and consequently has devel-
oped several new yeils and is working
on some more which he hopes will
urge Orange and Blue gladiators on
to greater dceds. However, yell
galore are of no avail unless properly
execuied and they can only be put
over when the student body stands
behind the cheer-lJeaders at practice
and at the games. Florin makes a | m:
plea for greater interest and better | ni
attendance at cheer practice by the
entire student body.
