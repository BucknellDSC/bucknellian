BATTLE,Everything possible has been done to better the sanitary conditions and to
make,"things more cleanly and home-like for the ""SemiteH."" First, all the fixtures were re- moved and the former unsanitary wooden flooring was taken out. All the phimhing under the floors was removed and the"
new,"system built in. Then a ""mineral floor"" tho latest thing in sanitary installation I was constructed. Tliat consists of a | two-inch basic layer of concrete, ii one-inch layer of firfer concrete next, and above that the actual floor, a I three-inch layer of a compositional"
made,up of fine cement and whit- marble-dust.
The,walls were built up for a distance of five feet above the floor with hard plaster and the re- mainder of the walls and the ceilings were constructed of ordinary plaster. Another item which will be regard- ed with mingled feelings of joy and .sorrow is the complete renovation of the reception-hall and parlor of the main huIUUnp; of the
Wnm^n's,"coU<<>>Re Formerly they were separated by a wall, but that has been torn out and a colonade slubstituted."
Two,beauti- ful
new,"rugs adorn the floor. The walls and celling of the entire lower floor have been painted in pale buff and white. It looks a hundred per- cent better, but several chronic *fu.ssers* will note with regret thn pa.sslng of that private spot, espec- laly slncel the ""Holy Sanctuary"" or ""Lover's Retreat."" that little room Just off the second-floor parlor is closed while In the process of renova- tion. Another welcome improvement Is the installation of a"
new,system of postal distribution consisting of three hundred and sixty-five lock-boxes. Previously the mall was just
dumped,on the table and the girls found their mall as best as possible.
A,complete
new,outfit of china an'l glass-ware has been purchastxl and is
now,"in use in the dlning-hall. The heating system in the Wolfe house was unsatisfactory last year, and during the"
summer,"the house was attached to the university stean\- heatlng system at the cost of over $3,000. It has been proml.sed that things will be kept"
warm,for the girls at the Wolfe House this winter. If present plans are carried out. Im- provements of
much,the same nature will be carried out in the
New,"build- ing next summer. There were also several Improve- u>""nts for the benefit of the entire student body. Professor Smith, assis- tant librarian, built In thirty tiers of six shelves each a hundred and eighty shelves altogether"
--,which only takes care of about half of the books whi<h were laying (Ui the floor of the library at the end of last term. More thYin as
many,shelves again are needed to take proper care of the re maindf r. In the
Academy,annex the entire lower floor has been changed Into Biology class rooms acocrding to the plans of Mr. Davis In order to acco- modate the overflow of the Increased enrollment In the Biology course. The basement is
now,devoted to the Doc- tor's guinea-pig farm.
Many,other 000 was spent on the five wash-rooms alone. They are
new,in every re.spect tlcularly plea.sed to have their friends from (jther houses accept Uieir invi- tation to drop in and enjoy the danc- ing.

much,"as none were held last year, the tryouts f(>r the present Sophmore^ and for the present Freshmen, will be at the same time in the near .'u ture. All those"
who,"handed llii ;i- names in last year,"

Cap,and Dagger l.s the men's dramatic society. It is limited In enrollment to 15 men. Af- ter a
man,has served threeVyears he receives a pin of the society from the society. Each jear
Cap,"and Dagger gives several plays. Such plays as ""Officer 666"", ""The Arrival of Kitty,"" ""Truth"", ""The Doll's House."" ""The World and His Wife,"" ""Strong- heart,"" and ""It Often Happens"" have been presented .successfully by the society."

THE,
MlFFLlNBrnO,
"TELEGRAPH,","has consents ,1 to print the Bucknellian this year, and t'l? editorial staff expects to see one oi the best appearing of college papers In this section of the country."
To,"get the news for the Bucknellian, ,it Is nece.ssary to have a staff of reporters. All"
men,"wishing to try out for a posi- tion on this staff .-should nui-nli the editor Immediately, as appointments will be"
made,"by the end of the pre- sent month. Positions on the Huck- nellian staff are purely compeletive, and candidates are selected by a mni- mlttco of the English departuient of the University. This assure^ a ""sriuare deal for everybody."" follow- ing out the policy of the Bucknellian."
SOCIAL,
SEASON,
STARTED,"The Bucknell social season has started off with a rush, as nearly all According to ancient custom, the"
"""Y""",opened this present college year with a welcome to all college
men,giving the new
men,an opportunity to meet and get aoiualnted with the Sophniores and Upper-classmen as well as members of their
own,"class. David Stewardson, this years"
"""Y""","president opened the mass meeting, which was held In the Gym, wel- coming everyone back to college and sounded the slogan of this years or- ganization."
He,"said that the ""Y"" and its ornanizatlon were at the"
command,I of the
men,on the
"""HILL""",and that the officers hoped to
make,the
"""Y""",a vital part of college life.
A,large crowd of
men,attended the meeting and the cheering which took place brought back memories of last years' gridiron battles.
Two,
members,of the football team were piesent in the capacity of speakers and the remarks of both McDermoti and Capt. Kostos were received with same earnestness and sincerely with which they were delivered.
A,
"""Y""",meeting would not be com- plete without one
man,of this Uni- versity
whom,all old
men,
know,so well. Prof. Llnderman. The speech which he gave
was,"typical, and tlie shouts that came in response to some of hi.s remarks gave evidence of the delight with which he"
was,"listened to. But with all fun, the seriousness of what he had to say In regard to holding up the standards of Old Hurknell and being real"
men,did not fail in getting across. President
Mason,of the Senior Class reminded the
men,that it was
up,to them to
make,things go.
He,pointed out that this year sees the largest enrollment the University has ever had and that new
men,"and old alike, should work to keep the colors of the Orange and Blue as high and peihap.- hiKlier than ever before. The last speaker of the evening was Dr."
Hunt,and the cheer which greeted
him,as he stood up was evi- dence of
warm,place that he had
won,for himself
among,the students. Dr. Hunt openti his remarks by repeat- ing his Invitation to any and all stu- dents
who,"cared to come to him and he would be glad to give tliem his time. ""I have nothing more important to do than to see any student"
who,"thinks he wants to see me."" said Dr. Hunt."
The,"rest of his remarks were In the nature of advice, pointing out the value of giving one's best."
He,said there was a time for giving and a time for taking and that to choose wisely sometimes meant the deter- mining of one's whole life. The meeting as a whole
was,a means of giving everyone present the necessary spur to
make,this year count for the most. Following the addresses refreshments of ice cream and pretzels were served cafeteria style and the remaining time was spent reading the identification cards on coat lapels which had been sup- plied by the committee earlier In the evening. The muss la'-etins in every
way,"was one to be remembered and from present outlook the ""Y"" influ- ence on the ""HIH"" looks as though it will surely be felt in the life of the student body this year. .More definite infornuition as to the program for the vear will be sent out later. Improvements have bfen planned and of the fraternities have given dance., next fall will in all probability see a and it Is understood that the .-orori-"

HOUSE,"There are still a few copies of the 1921 L' Agenda in the possession of Martin K. Mohler, the manager, and be secured from him at the"
Kappa,Sigma house .This will give tho.s<'
who,did not have the opportunity of getting a copy last year to get one now. There Is perhaps no better
way,"of preserving the memories of the college years than by looking over the L'Agendas,* so every person"
who,has ever been a student at Bucknell shbuld have one. It is especially ap- propriate that
members,"of the pre- sent Freshnum cia-ss should have one of these books, as Jt shows better than anything el.-e the activities of the school, and also enables the new- comers to get acquainted with the"
members,of the present Senior class.
The,"University of Pennsylvania de- feated the Orange and Blue on Frank lin Field, Philadelphle, Saturday, October 2, by a .score of 7-0, The score does not tell the story of the game, because the most conservative of the reports admitted that Bueknell play- ed as well as the big Red and Blue team, while every loyal Biuknelllan"
who,witnessed the
game,asserts that Bucknell outplayed Its heavier op- ponents. There are also those
who,"in- sist that the penalties imposed upon Bucknell by the referee were unjust. At any rate, it was a"
game,that
mado,the Peen
men,feel dubious about th*^ outcome until the final whistle had blown.
The,
game,"was In reality a punters duel, in which Captain Kostos had a slightly better advantage. The lin-^ plunging of Bow.<<er, and the hard woric of McDermott at end featured the name from the Bucknell stand- point, although every"
man,"on the team played such a steady, consistent"
game,that it is hardly fair to mention any particular
man,"as an indivldul star. The Orange and Blue line held like a -tone wall, and"
made,the cele- brated Helsman shift look like the
German,"line in the Argonne. Our backfield was a steady grovind gain- er, and matched Penn In the totals of first downs. Taken as a whole, our team was equal in every respect to the Red and Blue eleven, and only the breaks of the"
game,
made,"the scon- what it was. Dncknell lost two good chances of scoilng by unfortunate fumbles, one"
when,"(uily 14 yards from the Penn goal line. The.se fumbles, together with a total of 85 yards .setback be- o;...;.>.- of penalties for alleged oft-sld play.s and holdirig were the only things which kept the Orange and Blue from crossing the Penn line. On the other hand, Penn received very slight penalties for holding and off- side play, and received all of the breaks of the game. The story of"
how,Penn got its single touch
down,"is very well toll by the Philadelphia Record, under the heading ""Plucky Bucknell holds"
Penn,"down."" The Helsman hike and Pennsyl- vania gilded to a narrow triumph - over the veteran Bucknell Collegian^ at Franklin Field yesterday, by a single touch-down"
--,"score 7 to 0. In the second period, through some"
huky,"breaks, the Red and Blue got the oval within eif;ht yards of the Lewisburg contingent's goal post."
On,the last
down,"Joe Straus heaved the oval to Carl Thomas, behind the goal post, and the Brldesburg youth clutrhed the ball .safely as he tumbled for a score. Straus kicked the goal from touchdown. This was the only opening that"
was,"really afforded Pennsylvania until the final throes of the contest,"
when,Rex
Wray,and Joe Straus be- gan a triumphant march
down,"the field, and this pair had the ball with- in Bucknell's 10-yard line as the whistle blew. The battle reminded one of two famed gladiators"
who,"weie very, very nuich afraid of each other. Both Penn ani Bucknell fear- ed the other's strength and kept with in ;-ale bounds during the entire time. Only twice did both clubs essay the forward pass. The Red and Blue at- tempted It In the opening period"
when,they were on the five-yard line but the play failed.
The,"second trial gave the Quakers victory. During the whole game, Bucknell demonstrated the fighting spirit which has"
made,the Orange and Bin team feared by schools
many,"times her size, and never once gave up the fight. One of the things which sur- prisftl Penn the niost was the way the Orange and Blue supporters of the team came straggling into Phila- delphia, by means of freight trains. Fords, and hikers. It was estimated that there were over 500 Bucknell undergraduates and alumni in the stand.-- that afternoon, and their (.j^^rs. while not rivaling the thunderous roar of Pennsylvania in Turn To Page"

On,"Ice In Early Period. The Bucknell varsity, assi.stetl largely by the .second team, defeated Ursinus Saturday by a score of 48-0 before the largest crowd ever assem- bled on the local athletic field. The"
game,"in itself was not a real test of Bucknell's btrength, as the first (juurter, In which the first team took a very active part, was just a con- tinuous march"
down,the field for four touchdowns. The first touch-
down,was
made,In exactly 3
U,min- utes after the
game,"had started, and the second came three minutes after the first."
Two,more touchdowne were secured in the remaining eight min- utes of the quarter. After this the second string
men,"were put in, and the scoring did not pile up as fast a.-5 it had before. The one outstanding feature of the"
game,"was Bowser's Roal fro7n placement from the 45 yard line, which took the crowd, aa well as the opponents by surprise. The game started"
when,"Bowser kicked off to the Ursinus two yard line. Ursinus tried to advance the ball by playing straight football, but on the third play tried a forward pass which Uayholf intercepted. Bowser andGdaniec each took the ball for"
a,ir.-t
down,and then Bowser carrici . . it over the line for a touchdown.

To,the
members,of the Freshman class .the BucknelUan extends a hearty welcome.
To,"you ha.s been ex- tended a great opportunity, and it is our earnest desire to see you"
make,"the most of it. for by so doing, you will bring honor to the"
name,of Old Bucknell. Keep in mind that the more you put into your college life th^' more you will get out of it. Get into a>>
many,"activities as possible, and never fail to support the athletic teams of the university. Live up to the rules laid"
down,"by Senior council, as obedience to them is a test of your manhood. Perhaps it will seem to you that life during your first year at Buck- nell is not a smiling path of roses. Yet uluiuni"
who,"come back are un- animous in saying that the years spent in college are the best enjoyed of a whole lifetime, and that the"
Freshman,year is the best of all.
You,"are really privileged by being In col- lege, so try to do your best, and work for the honor and glory of Old Bvick- nell."

SPIRIT.,This year Bucknell T'niversity has a football team of which it
may,in- deed be proud.
From,"the two ganu-.- whlch have already been played, even the most pessiniistii' are unable to pie diet anything but the most pronii.-inK outlook for the rest of th.'^ season."
Under,"the careful coaching of ""Pete"" Reynolds, we"
may,be sure that the Orange and Blue warriors will bring the greatest of credit on the Instlti'- tlon whose
name,and colors the^f bear. It is the duty of every loyal
Buck,nellian to support the team to th< best of his ability by attending
mas,"meetings and practices on the athle tic field. The coach wants you to dis play your interest by coming out ti watch the team prepare for the bi,"
games,which are to come.

We,"insist* however, that Bucknell outplayed"
Penn,"in almost every feature of thq game, and that if the"
game,"were t^bil played over again on a neutral field, with neutral officials, Bucknell , would be the winner."

'-^>v,With
somewhat,"of the same ""pep"" shown during the season last year, the liuckiiell (ilee t'lui) is fast reor- ganizing for what looks like the betit season yet"
known,at ButTtnell. Last season brought forth the best club that has represented the university In years and thi.s year the prospects point to
an,"even more active and bet- ter year than last season proved to be. Profes.sor Stolz, dean of the Music School, is again director of the club and Ralph Hartz is the manager."
Any,"students desiring to try out for the club should attend the rehearsels as annoiniced from lime to time on the bulletin boards and consult with Prof. Stolz or Manas>'r Ilartz. There should be a wealth of material in the Freshmen class,"
and,"these new men, added to the remaining"
members,"of last year's club as a nucleus, should develop into a wonderful organiza- tion to represent Bucknell for the coming .sea.son. Students who can play the trombone, clarinet and flute are especially needed for the orches- tra work under the direction of ""Bobby "" Hartz. Plans for the year, as announced by Manager Hartz. include trips that cover practically the same ground as last year with (luite a"
number,of
new,"cities added to the list. The usual local dates will be secured, too, for already the surrounding towns are asking for concerts and are anxious to hear the club again."
The,"coast to coast trip looks very favorable ac- cording to the management, and will no doubt be taken. Plans of the club also include a minstrel"
show,to be given In the near future.
The,
members,of the clnb are practicing
now,"for this event, which will prove of unusual interest to the college and the town. Rehearsals be- gin this week. Every student shotild be on the lookout for the date and back the event."

AND,
DR.,

SPEAK,
AT,
BIG,
MASS,
MEETING,"Stephen F. Dinilich, '20, employed at the Atlas Powder works at Taiiia- qua, was here for the Urslnus game."
A,rousing nu'cting was held at IJucknell Hall Friday evening in preparation for the Bucknell IJrsi nus game the following day. Songs
and,"cheers swelled out, while the band played several ""peppy"" selec- tions. Mason, senior president presided, and after the football"
men,"had taken their accustomed places, called on the father of Atliletles at Huckneli, Bromley Smith, to speak. Prof. Smith, to j^peak. Prof. Smith gave"
some,amusing stories alxiut several of the slx-footors
who,played football foi- n. U.
Some,of the stories wero (juite obviously stretched. Dr.
Emory,
W.,"Hunt, president of the Pnivesrlty, linked up his talk' with Prof. Smith by saying that it"
was,one of these old-time players
who,
was,the cause of Bowser's coming to B. U. Ur.
Hunt,then contrasted the spirit
shown,at English
games,"and at American games. Football, he said, is largely a"
game,"of psychology, of de- termination. Three of the outstand- ing statements in Dr. Hunt's speech were ""I like the spirit"
shown,"here "". ""I respected our"
men,
when,"they left the field last week."" and"
"""Tomor",row's
game,"starts here."""
A,
number,of the football
men,"spoke, each at more or less length. Cavakantc proved himself a silver tf)ngiie(l orator, and he thinks Buck- nell's spirit Is ""marvelous."" The"
men,
who,"spoke were Bowser. 'Wlllsbach. Cavalcante. Bellak, Jameson, .Morett, Julian, Gdaneir. Wargo,. lJi<hl, Mc- Dermott, and Hahn. Arthur Harris announced that the election of head cheerleader would take place, and introduced Florin and Bechtel, the two candidates. Wh>'n the vote"
was,"counted, Florin had 133 and Bechtel 12C."

&,"Company, and a former nuMuber of the United States .Signal Corps. Col- onel Neville and Joyce each carried a $10,000 policy."

make,"things more cleanly and home-like for the ""Semites."" First, all the fixtures were re-"
moved,and the former unsanitary v^ooden flooring was taken out. All the plumbing under the floors was removed and the
new,"system built In. Then a ""mineral floor""^"
--,th'j latest thing in sanitary installation

nmde,up of fine cement and white j marblc-duHl. The walls were built up for a distance of five feet above the floor with hard plaster and the re- mainder of the walls and the ceilings were constructed of ordinary plaster. Another item which will be regard- ed with mingled feelings of joy and sorrow Is the complete renovation of the reception-hall and parlor of the
main,"building of the Wonv'Ti's college Formerly they were separated by a wall, but that has been torn out and a colonudc slubslituted."
Two,l>tauti- ful
new,"rugs adorn the floor. The walls and ceiling of the entire lower floor havf.' been painted in pair buff and white. It looks a hundred per- cent better, but several chronic *fus.sers"" will note with regret tho pa.ssing of that private spot, espec- laly slncel the ""Holy Sanctuary"" or ""Lover's Retreat."" that little room just off the .second-floor parlor is closed while in the proce.ss of renova- tion. Another welcome improvement Is the Installation of a"
new,system of postal di: trib\itlon consisting of three hundred and sixty-five lock-lwxea. Previously the mail was just
dumped,on the table and the girls found their mail as best as po.ssible.
A,complete
new,outfit of china and glass-ware has been purchase<l and is
now,"in u.se in tiie dining-hall. The heating sy.stem in the Wolfe house was unsatisfactory last year, and during the"
summer,"the house wu.s attachf^ to the university steam- heating system at the cost of over $;',.O00. It. has been promi.^ed that things will be kept"
warm,for the girls at the Wolfe House this winter. If present plans are carried out. im- provements of
much,the same nature will be carried out in the
New,"build- ing next summer. There were also .several Improve- ments for the benefit of the entire student body. Professor Smith, assis- tant librarian, built in thirty tiers of six shelves each"
--,a hundred and eighty shelves altogether
--,which only take.-; care of about half of the. books which were laying on the floor of the library at the end of last term. More than as
many,shelves again are needed to lake proper care of the re mainiler. In the
Academy,annex the entire lower floor has been changed into 15iolopy clas.'-rooms acocrdin;; to the plans of Mr. Davis In order to acco- nu)date the overflow of the Increased enrollment in the Biology course. The basement Is
now,devoted to the Doc- tor's guluea-pig farm.

Very good cider was to be had during the course of the evening and during th<' intermission which came at about ten o'clock fruit salad and pimento sand- wiches were served. The music was provided by the ""Sterling Six"" of Williamsport. The majority of the members of the orchestra are nieni- bers of the Williamsport post of the American Legion.

men,giving the
new men,an opportunity to meet and get acfiuainted with the Sophmores and Upper-classmen as well as members of their
own,"class. David Stewardson, this years ""Y"" president opened the nia.ss meeting, which was held in the"
Gym.,wel- coming everyone back to college and sounded the slogan of this years or- ganization.
He,said that the
"""Y""",and Its organization were at the
command,of the
men,on the
"""HILL""",and that the officers hoped to
make,"the ""Y"" a vital part of college life."
A,large crowd of
men,attended th< meeting and the cheering whlcl took place brought back memorle.^ r last years' gridiron battles.
Tw,members of the football team we;^ present in tho capacity of speake and the remarks of both .McDermo' and Capt. Kostos were received wli same earnestness and slncerety wit which they were delivered.
A,
"""Y""",meeting would not be conv plete without one
man,of this Ufil- vcrslty
whom,all old
men,
know,"yn well, Prof. Llnderman. The speech which he gave was typical, and the sh()\its that"
came,"in response to some of his remarks gave evidence of the delight with which he was listened to. But with all fun, the seriousn-ss of what he had to say in regard to holding up the standards of Old Bucknell and being real"
men,did not fail in getting across. President Ma.son of the Senior Class reminded the
men,that It was vip to them to
make,"things go. He pointed out that this year sees the large.st enrollment the University has evir l.iul and Hint U'-w m>>in and old alike, should work to keep the colors of the Orange and Blue as high and perl-.ap.! higher tli;in ever before. The last speaker of the evening was Dr."
Hunt,and the cheer which greeted him as he stood up
was,evi- dence of
warm,place that he had
won,for himself
among,the students. Dr. ]Iunt openei his remt.rks by repeat- ing his invitation to any and all stu- dents
who,cared to come to
him,"and he would be glad to give them his time. ""1 have nothing more important to do than to see any .student"
who,"thinks he wants to see me."" .said Dr. Hunt. The rest of his remarks were in the nature of advice, pointing out tho value of giving one's bcpt."
He,said there was a time for giving and a time for taking and that to choose wisely sometimes meant the deter- mining of one's whole life. The meeting as a whole was a means of giving everyone present th;' nece.ssary spur to
make,this year count for the most. Following the addresses refreshments of Ice cream and pretzels were served cafeteria style and the remaining time was spent reading the identification card.^ on coat lapels which had been sup- plied by the committee earlier In tho evening.

Agenda,"in the posse.sslon of Martin K. .Mohlor. tlie manager, ari be secured from him at the Kappa Sigma house .This will give those"
who,did not have the opportunity of getting a copy last year to get one now. There is perhaps no better way of preserving the memories of the college years than by looking over the L'Agendas. so every per.son
who,"has ever been a student at Bucknell should have one. It Is cFpeclally ap- propriate that members of the pre- .sent Freshman class should have one of the.se book.s, as It shows better -than anything else the activities cf the school, uiiu also enable;' t.ic nov- comers to get acquainted with the members of the present Senior class. It- .,f Callfornlo V-; s liiirdly fair to nxnlion any particular"
man,"as an individul star. The Orange and Blue line held like a ^tone wall, and made the ct !e- brated lleisnian shift look like tlie"
German,"line in the Argonne. Our backfi< id was a steady ground gain- er, and matched Penn in the totals of first downs. Taken as a whole, our team was equal In every respect to the Red and Blue eleven, and only the breaks of tli*' game"
made,"th'' score what it was. Bucknell lost two good chances of scoring by unfortunate fumbles, one"
when,"only 14 yards from the Penn goal line. These fumbles, together with a total of 8 5 yards setback bc- caube of penalties for alleged off-sida fi'.uj. r.r.d holding were the only things which kept th(c) Orange and Blue from cropslrg the Penn line."
On,"Hie other hand. Penn received very slight penalties for holding and off- ,-ide play, and received all of the breaks of the game. The story of"
how,Penn got It.s single touch
down,"Is very well tolJ l)y thV Philadelphia Record, under the heading 'Plucky Bucknell holds Penn down."" The H<'isman hike and Pennsyl- vania glided to a narrow triumph over the veteran Bucknell Collegians at ^runkliu Field yesterday, by a single touch-down"
--,"score 7 to 0. In the second period, through some lurky breaks, the Red and Blue got I lie oval within . eight yards of the Liwlsburg contingent's goal post."
On,the last
down,"Joe Straus heaved the o\al to Carl Thomas, behind the goal p<.st, and the Bridesburg youth <lutchcd the ball safely as he tumbled for a pcore. Straus kicked the goal from touchdown. This was the only opening that was really afforded Pennsylvania until the final throes of the contest, wlien Rex"
Wray,and Joe Straus be- gan a triumphant march
down,the fi' Id. and this pair had the ball with- in Bucknell's 10-yard line as th.- wliistle blew. The battle reminded one of two famed gladiators
who,"\\ere very, very"
much,"afraid of each oilier. Both Penn and Bucknell fear- id the other's strength and kept with in safe bounds during the entire time. (>nly twice did both clubs es.say the f rwcird pa: s. The R''d and Blue at- t. nipted it in the opening period when they were on the five-yard line iiMt the play failed. The .-second trial gave the Quakers victory. During the whole game, Bucknell demonstrated the fighting spirit which has"
made,the Orange and Bin o t.
am,"feared by school- ni.Tny timen her size, and never once gave up the fight. One of the things which sur- prised Penn the most was the v.ay tl'.e Orange and Blue supporters of the team came straggling into Phila- delphia, by means of freight traln<<. Fords, and hikers. It was estimated that there were over 500 Bucknell undergraduates and alumni in the stands that afternoon, and t'.ieir cheers, while not rivaling the thunderous roar of Pennsylvania in Ttirn"

The,first touck-
down,was
made,"in exactly 3 1/4 min- utes after the game had started,"
and,the second came three minutes after the first.
Two,more touchdowns were secured in the remaining eight min- utes of the quarter. After this the second string

and,the scoring did not pile up as fast as It had before. The one outstanding feature of the
game,"was Bowser's goal from placement from the 46 yard line, which took the crowd, as well as tho opponents by surprise."
The,game started
when,"Bowser kicked off to the Ursinus two yard line. Ursinus tried to advance the ball by playing straight football, but on the third play tried a forward pass which Dayhoff intercepted. Bowser andGdaniec each took the ball for a first dov.u and then Bowser tarried it over the line for a touchdown."

more,you will get out of it. Get Into S8
many,"activities as possible, and never fail to support the athletic teams of the university. Live up to the rules laid"
down,"by Senior council, as obedience to them is a test of your manhood. Perhaps it will seem to you that life during your first year at Buck- nell is not a smiling path of roses. Yet alumni who ccnie l)uck are un- animous in saying that the years spent in college are the best enjoyed of a whole lifetime, and that the"
Preshman,year is the best of all.

SPIRIT.,This year Bucknell University has
a,football team of which it
may,in- deed be proud.
From,"the two garnet- which have already been played, even the most pessimistir"" aro unable to pro diet anything but the most promit-.ing outlook ffir the rest of th;,' sca.-^on. Under the careful coaching of ""Pete"" Reynolds,"
we,
may,be sure thai the Orange and Blue warriors will bring the greatest of credit on the instltti- tion whose
name,and colors they bear. It is the duty of every loyal Buck- nellian to support the team to the beat of his ability by attending mass meetings and practices on the athle- tic field.
The,coach wants you to dis- play your interest by coming out to watch the team prepare for tlie hi;
games,which are to come.

known,"at BucknoU, Last season brought forth the best club that has represented the university in years and this year the prospects point to an even more active and bet- ter year than last season proved to be. Professor Stulz, dean of the Music School, is again director of the club and Italph Hartz is the manager."
Any,"students desiring to try out for the club should attend the rehear.sels as announced from time to time on th.< bulletin boards and consult with Prof. Stolz or Manager Hartz. There should be a wealth of material in the Freshmen cla.^s, and these"
new,"men, added to the remaining members of last year's club as a nucleus, should develop into a wonderful organiza- tion to repret^ent Bucknell for the coming season. Students"
who,"can play the trombone, clarinet and flute are especially needed for the orches- tra work under the direction of ""Bobby"" Hartz. Plans for the year, as announced by Manager Hartz. include trips that cover practically tlie same ground as last year with (juite a number of"
new,cities added to the list.
The,"usual local dates will be secured, too, for already the sunounding towns are asking for concerts and are anxious to hear the club again. The coast to coast trip looks very favorable ac- cording to the management, and will no doubt be taken. Plans of the club also include a minstrel show to t)e given in the near future. The"
members,of the club are practicing
now,"for this event, which will prove of unusual interest to the college and the town. Rehearsals be- gin this week. Every student should be on the look-out for the date and back the event."

One,"volume, at least"
made,up for it in true school spirit. The line up was as follows: Part of the prepapration of Buck- nell for the big
game,with
Penn,"was the super mass meeting held in Buck- nell Hall last Thursday evening. For an hour the cheerleaders, Florin and Bcchlell and a"
number,"of speaker.s, instilled confidence and enthusiasm into the minds of the nuMubers of the team and of the student body. The cheering threatened to tear off the roof and break out the sides of the building, while the stamping of feet would have completed the destruc- tion. I'opular songs were roared out from lusty throats in the early part of the meeting. ""Ray, Bucknell"" and ""Bucknell Warriors"" were repeated more than once. Cheers and yells for the team and for the speakers as they were intro- duced cau.sed"
many,a hoar.se voice. The Bucknell Band was on hand with plenty of harmonious racket.
When,the Hall
was,"practically filled, the members of the team who were not afraid to face the music marched up the aisle, while the stu- dent body exercised their lungs. Mason, Prc-^idenl of the Senior Class, introduced as the first speaker, C. E. Gla:s, this year's graduate manager. Mr. Glass appealed to the students for their entire cooperation, telling them that his work and the woik of all athleltic promoters would be in vain without loyalty from the stu- dent body."
A,
number,"of the team spoke more or le.^s briefly. One anJ all e\pres,^<<'d confidence In the downfall of Penn."
The,
men who,"spoke were Dooley, Captain Ivnstos, Reed, McDerniolt. Morrett, and Blehl, in the order named. Tlie two feature addresses f)f the evening were"
made,by Prof. Leo Rockwell and Registrar B. F. Thomas. Prof. Rockwell called up some of BuckneH's old record.^ and reviewed them in the light of pre- sent day events.
He,"told of a team of twenty-five years ago. and of its hopes, .successes, and failures."
He,"concluded with the statement that Leuisbur^; re,-icUnts were rumored to be taking out h'avy insurance on all their movable wooden property. Reg- istrar"
Thomas,"centered his talk upon a plea for fair, clean football all tho time; and cited instances of dirty playing. Honesty, faithfulness, and clean playing were the points he em- phasized. It was announced that on Friday students were to as.semble at the Pennsylvania station to give the team a rousing send-off. It was al.so an nounced that in case of a Bucknell victory, .'chool v.ould be ""out"" on .Vionday. and thai in the evealiiK a big bonfire would be built on th"" .Athletic field."

That university training is high- ly regarded in Japan is evidenced by the fact that the government schools of college grade have for the pa.-t few years been unable to accept more than two-thirds of the applicants.

Some,of the stories w(ye Quite obviou.'Oy stretched. Dr.
Emory,
W.,"Hunt, president of the Univesrlty, linked up his talk with Prof. Smith by saying that it was one of the.se old-time players"
who,was the cause of Bowser's coming to B. U. Dr.
Hunt,"then contrasted the spirit shown at English games and at American games. Football, he said, i.^ largely a"
game,"of p.sychology, of d""- termination. Three of the outstand- ing statements in Dr. Hunt's speeih were ""I like the spirit"
shown,"here"". ""I respected our"
men,
when,"they left the field last week."" and ""Tomor- row's game .starts here.""-"

PLAY THE,
GAME.,In order to accomplish great things
man,has found union of purpose to be of the utmost necessity.
No,great group of individuals ever
won,a bat- tle uiile.ss ihty worked togetlier as a unit. The only
way,
man,can work In unity is to select leaders and then follow- the leaders. The popular
way,of choosing leaders is by election.
We,elected a cheer leader some time ago
who,will lead the parades and dem- onstratlans.
He,l.s popular with the student body. Let every loyal stu- dent stand by him. Let's hear no whisper of discontent. The last year hfifi brought great changes in the ad- ministration of the University. With it has come a shifting power in the student body. Former leaders have been retired in favor of
men,
who,have found popular favor.
The,change was due and It came. Good
men,"will fall in line behind the new leaders. Straeplers will soon be lost from the line forever. Bucknell is go- ing on, greater today than ever be- fore, to greater things than ever be- fore attempted."
No,
man,is big enough to be a leader unless he is big enough tj take his place
among,the followers of his .succes.sor.
No,
man,is so great but what tlie world .soon finds a greater.
We,are going to have unity
among,the boosters of the University. If a
man,"cannot stand with the majority, Le Ls not playing fair tohim.<elfnor to his .school. Get together and felo- brate our athletic victories. Back *verythlng the school attempts and you will"
be,building for your
own,success. It is the boosters that run the world.

A,
GREAT,
NEED,If there is one need that is para-
mount,"for the success of Bucknell, u- thletics this year, it is development or organized and effective cheering. Coaches and players will testify to the fact that the vocal and spiritual support of a well trained and well led cheering section is an Important factor in the winning of games. Bucknell, long noted for her spirit and for the cheering ability of her student body, has been lax in main- taining this reputation in the past few years. This, like"
many,"other de- fects,"
may,"be blamed partly upon the effects of war, but not entirely .so. Both cheering staffs and student body have*been apathetic in their support of Buckneli's teams. The ex- perience of the past year has proven that the substitution of individual witticisms for organized support is a failure. It Is the duty this year of the cheer leader and his asj^Lstants to develop and maintain a cheering body that is well trained and enthusiastic. This is not an easy task, but it is a neces- .sary one. and it merits the support of every loyal Bucknellian. It is a task which must be begun soon and con- tinued thruout the entire year. It is a task that coaches, players and alum ni"
demand,and expect to be accom- plished. It is a task in which the greatest service is
demanded,"of the Freshman cla.ss. Bucknells athletic teams this year will fight to the limit of their en- durance and ability, just in so"
much,as Buckneli's
men,and
women,rally behind them with the full strength f)f voice and enthusiasm.

URSINUS,Another forward step in givin;.; students and other resident
members,of the College conununlty additional buying convenience is announced by the College Supply Store. It is
now,possible thru special ar- rangement with a bureau of expcit shoppers in Philadelphia to place an order with the Ursinus College Sup- ply Store for
ANY,article desired froma Philadelphia store. The shop- pers will personally select the arti- cle desired at the lowest retail pricei available and ship via parcels ex- press to the College Store on the same day. It is thus possible to secure ar- ticles within twenty-four to forty- eight hours.
The,"only charge for this service will be a ten per cent, ad- vance on the purchasing price to cover cost of ordering, shopping, and shipment."
No,charage will be
made,"for shipment except from those con- cerns which do not nuike mail order deliveries free, in which case postag? ischarged. Students with account.^ at the Supply Store"
may,"receive ciedit on their purchases for fifteen days. At the annual oratorical contest of the Chinese Students' Prohibition League, F. P. Chen, University of .Michigan,"
won,"first place, and Mis;s Lily Soo Hoo, Oberlin College,"
won,second honors.

Dr. Judd has not cum- putcd wluit percent this is of the whole alumni of Bucknell, but one fact is evident-- that there is unlim- ited opportunity for Bucknell gradu- ates to share in this work for their alma mater. Bucknellians everywhere are ask- ing the Question,"
"""What","of ovir'piom- Lsed $1,500,000?"" The answer Is this If the Board of Promotion of North- ern Baptists realizes their financial goal of one hundred million dollars In five years, Bucknell will receive the remainder of her $1,500,000 a- bove what has been subscribed thru lo!"

The,buds!:et allotment of $13.00 is paid at the Rcgl.^trar's office with the regular college bill. The first semester's division amounts to ?7.00 and the second to $6.00.

members,"were en- tertained at a dance at the Sigma Chi hou.se. Saturday morning the variou.- newspaper representatives were con- ducted on a tour through the campu.-. and inspected the buildings with in- terest, especially the agricultural and dairy farms. They were also treat' d to a view from the top of ""Old Main"" from which point they could look in to four counties as well a.s see a beautiful view of the Penn State, campus. Saturday afternoon the visiting journalists were taken to"
New,"Beaver Field, where, in a reserved box in th<"

The,"Bucknell Glee Club journeyed to Williamsport on Tuesday evening and furnished the music for the ser- vices tluit evening of the Pennsyl- 1 vanla Baptist State Convention meet- | ing in the First Baptist church. They , sang with splendid effect at both the evening banquet and the general ses- sion of the Convention, and"
many,"were the words of commendation for their good work. Manager Hartz and his assistant remained in Williamsport on Wed- nesday and Thursday in order to con- fer witli the pastors and delegates from the various cities in regard to the possibilities of holding concerts in their cities, wonderful interest and co-operation were manifested on the part of ail, the possibilities for con- certs are so numerous that it"
may,"bo neces,sary to hold two trips through western Pcnnsylvnia and the usual eastern trip, aside from the general run of ""near-by"" engagements. In all. delegates and pastors from al- most forty towns were interviewed and In almost every instance the con- versation was favorable for a con- cert."
Many,"towns visited last year are asking for return concerts, as well a.^ the"
many,
new,towns to be vis- ited. This makes an opening

game,"that did not show the greatest of Bucknell's posslbllitlee, the Orange and Blue defeated"
Muh-,lenberg at Allenlown Saturday by a score of 43-0. According to
members,"of the team, the two features of tho game were"
made,"by Bowser, the giant fullback. At one period of the"
gam*,he astonished the crowd with a goal from placement from the 44 yard lln<< similar to the one
made,here against Ursinus. and at another time he got off on a pretty 35 yard run through most of the
AUentown,"team without any interference, there having been a hitch in the play. His kick-offs were also marvelled at by Muhlenberg. a6 each one of them sailed past the op- posing team's goal line. Although the game was an easy one for Bucknell the Orange and Blue warriors worked hard, and each"
man,played his best Co(h Reynolds seems to have picked out a winning combination in the present line-up. and it is possible that he will continue It with few changes for the remainder of the season. The story of the
game,Is told very well by the Philadelphia Record as follows: AUentown. Oct. 23.
--,
No,machine ever worked with finer precision than the Bucknell football team in scoring a 43-to victory over
Muh-,"lenberg here this afternoon. The visi- I tors earned every point because thef were good. There was a crowd of 5000. mostly Muhlenberg rooters. Be- fore the game was far advanced they were fascinated by the .-plendid play- ing of the visitors, and most of th<< applause was for the Bucknellians. Muhlenberg at that, was"
game,"to the core and fought every inch, but could not hold the powerful battering rams from Lewisburg. If there was any roughness it was on the Muhlen- berg side. Possibly,"
man,for
man,the Muhlenberg players are as good
men,"as the Bucknell war-hor.-es, but the"
AUentown,"eleven was minus the mar-, vellous work that makes a gridiron t<quad a victorious machine. Bucknell played .straight football and"
made,"every one of its six touch- downs through tackle, after pusliiny their opponents"
down,the field. 1<< the very first period the visitors tool the heart out of the
home,"team by .scoring two touchdowns, one by Bow- ser and one by Wilsbach. McDermott missed his goal kick, but"
Mangan,scored. In the .second quarter Bowser twice went over tlie line.

me,that
we,are giving too
much,"attention to atbletlcs and too little to the mental dovftlopment which comes from the TOfjgh and tumble contest of the de- bating .society."" These are the words of William G. VIcAdoo, universally regarded as one ol America's brainest men. in a re- cent Interview with a representative of the Yale Daily News. Whether or"
ot,Mr.
McAdoo,was justified in
making,"such a sweeping assertion, it is nevertheless a deplorable fact that so ittel attention has in late years been paid to debating at Buckn>'ll."
To,say that there is no interest Bbovin here in the subject or that there is no material with which to ->>^'ork would be fallacious. If. as Mr.
McAdoo,"holds, debating Is ju.st as important as athletics in tb<< development of good citizenship"
and,"if it is the purpose of Bucknell to .Tiend forth good citizens from her liall.s,"
why,"then would it not be aa- vl.'iable for the school authorities to take a hand in the matter, giving txtme offi'ial recognition to those"

U3,"Phi Gar..ma I'cHa bmther.-. As a result of the vastly Increased uses and need for passenger and truck transportation, the automotive Industry"
now,ranks second largest in the world. The
number,of motor cars registered in this country has Increased 400 per cent since the war. The position of the General Mo- tors Corporation in this industry i:^ unequalled
--,in fact It is the largest producer of a finished product of any
kind--,"its sales for lt>>19 having total- led 1509,000,000 while for the six months ending June 30, 1920 Ihey were $320,000,000. In this great organization, the Ex- port division is perhaps the young est. but because of the strategic pos tion of the United States with re- gard to foreign trade, has rapidly become one of the most important of the subsidiaries."
From,a personnel of less than 200 in August 1919. i>> has expanded until it
now,employs more than 600 per.sons; but it is sti lanx- lous to secure
men,of the riglit cali- bre
--,"mental, morall and physical- to represent it abroad. In the branch offices which are being estab- lished throughout the world. Realizing, however that the"
num-,ber of
men,
who,"possess the desired experience it* relatively small, the General .Motors Export"
Company,has already organized a Training School in which it seeks to develop
men,
who,"possess the potential qualities desired Naturally the college graduate is a logical candidate. Although he has a valuable training and mental dis- cipline, yet he is not immediately qualified to assume the responsibility that come with representing so great an enterpri.se abroad. Therefore, at great expense, the company gives each"
man,"a year's training, divided as follows: Three months in which the student goes to school from 9 until 3 P."
M.,in the
Company,cla.ss room and has from 3 until 5 P.
M.,"for study. Dur- ing these three months he is given instruction in the principles of sales- manship, practical salesmanship, sales letter and report writing, cable messages, foreign trade, accounting foi-elgn languages, advertising, and office practice."
The,next three months &te spent in the
Company,"offices at definitely assigned duties in the various de- partments; while the third (luarter is spent in the Technical Shop with two hours per day instruction in the theory of internal combustion en- gines, and four hours daily in actual"
work,on all the chassis'
made,by the Corporation. Here each
man,"gets a thorou.ah training in the electrical starting and lighting eciuipment of the cars, as well as in the repair, tear-down and as.sembly of the var- ious units. The final three months are spent in the offices in"
New,York City. Dur- ing the nine months following the lecture and class room work .each
man,"gets three hours per week of foreign language instruction. Factory trips, lasting about three weeks, are worked In where tho schedule permits, and at the end of the year each student"
who,has be^-n able to finish the course is given a position as a regular employee f)f the Export
Company,with a
minimum,salary of ?150 monthly. Here lie i: employed until there Is a
vacam,y abroad which he can fill.
Upon,"for- eign assignment, the"
minimum,"is $200 monthly with all legitimate expen.ses paid while traveling. During tlie one year training per- iod the salary Is $100.00 monthly and at present an emergency allowance (-f $25,011 monthly is"
made,to l.^-'lp meet living expen.ses in
New,"York Cl:y. A.-; can be seen from tlie forego- ing schedule, a"
new,group of 21
men,enters the School cve-y three months. Of these. 12
men,will be tralncJ f)r
work,"as Field Sal:s Rcpresontitives G for work as Fi;il Technics! Re- prestntativos, and C for wo.k a.< Ac- countants. Field Technical Representatives will travel the territory assigned to their Branch and see to it that all dealers and distributors maintain the prope rkind of service stations; and"
when,"ne> es.sary. to help a di.stributor or dealer train his mechanics and service men, as well as to advise with"
him,"not only on the aylout of a ser- vice station, but also on the installa tlon of the proper machinery ami systems for handling spare parts and repair work. While the Accountants will neces- sarily remain at branch headquar ters, their work will be varied and the more valuable they can mak- themselves In the"
way,"of handllns; various matters, the more latitude and respf)nslblllty they would prob- ably be given by the Branch .Man- ' agers. In the beginning they will un- doubtedly have to keep the books of the Branch, and will conduct"
much,of the correspondence with the
Home,"Office. It is probably that they will do the purchasing for the office, hire the help, and talk to dealers or dis- tributors"
when,"the Branch Manager and his Assistant are away. The Ac- countant can probably become t)ffice Manager of his Branch if he develops sufficient executive ability. With such an organization, and possessed of such training, the future Is limited only by the capability of the Individual himself.

Howland,Blashfield decorated the great central
dome,of the Library of Congress. His war posters attracted international at tention. His most recent Important work was the design for the govern- ment's certificate J)f honor issued for every
man,
who,died or was wounded in service during the war. The impressive Lincoln Memorial at Washington was designed by Henry Bacon .He fornu^rly was a
member,"of the firm of .McKim,"
Mead,and White.
He,"is a memijer of the .National Institute of Arts and Let- ters, and the National"
Academy,of Design. Benjamin Morris
was,"the archi- tect for the Junius Spencer Morgan .Memorial at Hartford, the West- chester county Court House at White Plains, and is the designer of tlie"
new,Cunard Building at 25 Broadway
New,York.
He,Is president of the So- ciety of Beaux Arts Architects. Charles
Dana,Gib.^on is
known,throughout the world as an Illustra- tor.
He,has a wide personal acquain- tance
among,"artists and architects. ""Life"" was recently purchased by .Mr. Gibson and he is"
now,its publisher. The
new,clubhouse will be cen- trally located and will serve not only a;' a
monument,to the
men who,"died, but also as a"
home,"for living officers active or retired, in the army, navy or state militia. Civilians Interested in the nation's defense are also eli- gible for associa^ membership."
The,"committee on design will de- cide the rules governing the com- petlve drawings the club will request of all the leaching architects. Only tentative plans have been decldcnl on, but Interesting features of the"
new,building are included in thesf. The memorial feature will prob- ably take the form of a central court or hall with bronze paneled walls where the names of those
who,
made,the supreme sacrifice will be en- graved. The present clubhouse at 1 S Gra- mercy Park has long been unsulted for entertaining the hundreds of of- fleers
who,annually come to New- York. During the war
members,found It very Inadequate. Naval officers of this and other allied countries were entertained at the
New,"York Yacht Club, but"
Army,officers in
New,York during those trying days found hotels overcrowded and tbem.-ielves without a
home,to which they could go for suitable accommodations. Since the war the need has been even more emphasized. While en- listed
men,"have canteens, huts and clubhouses, the officers have been without a place to go for meals, or lodgings, except the very expf-nsive hotels. The moderate pay of our mili- tary leaders ha.,"
made,the cost of stopping at these hoatelries almost prohibitive. In the
new,clubhouse there will be at least 400 bedrooms.
A,large dormitory furnished with cots will al.so be provided for use on special occasions
when,the city is crowded with service men. There also will be a large as- sembly hall and small rooms for meet- ings of patriotic societies.
Women,"friends of members, or"
women,rela- tives of the deceased
men,will find a dining rom and reception
room,for their exclusive use. Other features to be found in a modern clubhouse will be in eluded in the plans.
The,club recently broadened its I .scope so ae to Include In Its
member-,"' ship all officers, ex-offlcers. and all I rom missioned"
men,"with the alllKd ! armies during the war, numbering ap ! proximately 204)^000. I"

H.,Noll. '19. I^eon
H.,"Noll, a junior engineer employed In the El Dorado field, wa.^ found dead Friday morning in the motor hou.se of Well No. 12, Ander- .'^on lease, four miles from El Dorado. The di;-covery"
was,
made,"about eight o'clock. It is believed his death was caused by an electrical shock from the switch in the motor room w here he was v,f)rklng. Mr. .Noll had been working out of the Barnhlll sub-stAtlon two week.-* before his tragic death, and had been in the Kl Dorado field a short time previous to hi.s transfer to meter- reading work."
He,was 2 6 years old. He
was,"a graduate electrical en- gineer from Bucknell University, and also took a course in the United States Naval Steam Engineering School."
He,"had been in the employ of the Empire Companies about four- teen months, coming to the Doherty organization as a junior engineer on his graduation from Bucknell. His home"
was,"in Lowisb\irg, Pa., where he has a mother and several other relatives, and to which place the body"
was,sent for burial. Mr. Noll's death
came,as a blow to his friends .not only
among,"his fellow junior engineers, but also to those"
whom,he had
come,"In contact during his year with the Empire or- ganization. Junior engineers of the EI Dorado field, meeting shortly after the death' of Leon"
H.,".Noll, who"
was,killed last F^rlday nu)rnlng by an electrical shock
and,have adopted the follow- ing resolutions in
memory,of their fellow engineer: Resolution
"WHEREAS,","the Almighty God, in His infinite wisdom has seen fit to remove from our midst our highly es- teemed confrere and co-worker, Leon Henry Noll; Whereas, the deceased, during thi' period of his association with us, has evidenced to those about lilni the aus- terity of his conscience by practicing what is right and by doing what \\ just; Whereas, it Is"
common,"knowledge that in the death of our departed friend, the Henry L. Doherty"
Com-,"pany has lost one of the most loyal, enthusiastic and promising Junior Engineers;"
THEREFORE.,
BE,
IT,
RESOLVED,"that we, the Junior Engineers of the Henry L. Doherty Company, in meet- ing assembled, while bowing in sub- mission to the win of our Heavenly I'ather, do hereby express our most profound sorrow for the death of our dearly beloved associate, Leon Henry Noll: . cj."
RESOLVED,
"FURTHER,","that copies of this resolution be sent to all Junior Engineers of the Bartleville school, to the family of the deceased, and to ""The Empire"
and,"the ""Buck- nellian"" for publication."

TAKEN,
A,panoramic view of the student body of Bucknell University was taken last
Monday,afternoon on the athletic field. With few exceptions the entire body of students turned out for the picture which was origin- ally scheduled for \.\e. forenoon. This is the first picture of this nature that has been taken since the year 1916. It is the custom to take such views of the students from time to time but no such picture has been laken since three years; before the S. A. T. C. period.
Two,"views of the group were taken one of which will be used for this years edition of the ""L'Agenda"". Copies of the pictures will be placed on sale to the students at various central points as soon as th>>-y are finished. It is expected that the views will be completed within a very short time."

After,
Parade,in
Morning.,"ArmiHtice Day, Nov. 11, will be obKerved with appropriate Kervices at Bucknell. Thin fact was"
made,
known,"to the student body at chapel exer- cises, at which lime President"
Emory,
W. Hunt,announced that at the re- quest of Senior Council the faculty had decided to allow a holiday on :
November,"11, instead of November 2."
A,"committee was appointed, com- posed of Mason. Davis, MacUerniott and Quinn. to take charge of the activities of the day and to"
make,up a suitable program of patriotic ser- vices and sports. This committee be-
came,active at once and by the end of the past
week,had a rough outline of the day's events ready.
When,this rough outline wa.s
made,"public, it was with the explanation that a de- tailed program would be ready for publication in another week. There will be a parade in the morn- ing. This is assured, although the lineup of the organizations and the time of starting are not yet definite. Several organizations will send dele- gations. They are the Lewisburg Post of the American Legion;"
Company,
M,"of the National Guard of Peunsylva- nia, with headquarters in Lewisburg; and the Civil"
War,"Veterans. The line will form at the Tustin gymna.sium After forming at the gymnasium, the line will march to the Baptist church 80 as to reach that place at 10 o'clock. The formation of the students delegations in the parade will be announced at a later date. At the Baptist church, a patriotic service will be held. Dr. John"
Howard,Harris will be the speaker of the day. but his subject has not yet been
made,public. The Glee Club Quartet has promised to sing several songs. Seats for the faculty and their wives and for the townpeople will be re- .served. This fact and that of the entire plans for the Armistice
Day,celebration will be announced in all the churches of the town in ample time.
An,attempt Is being
made,"to secure General Charles Clement, of Sunbury. for an address in the morning's ser- vice at the Baptist church. General Clement"
made,"an investigation trip of Europe before the World War, and upon the outbreat of the war wa.^ declared too old for active service. Since then he has been travelljng and lecturing, and has gained for himself an enviable record as a lecturer. If the fact can be accomplished the committee will have General Cle- ments here Nov. 11. Dr.."
Hunt,will be in charge of th.^ services at the church. It is expected that a very large
number,"of .people will be present; and, in fact, some doubt as to the ability of the seatln capacity of the church to accomod the crowd 1h entertained. However, every student of the University, to- gether with the faculty and ton-n- people. Is urged to attend the service. ) In the afternoon the Freshmen-Soph omore foot ball"
game,"will be held on the athletic field, and at this time the organizations above mentioned will be the guests of honor."
The,
game,"will be called at 2:30 o'clock, and Inasmuch as a great deal depends upon the outcome of this"
game,a re- cord crowd is looked for. In the evening the fraternity houses will keep open house and in- formal smokers will be held.

What,Muhlenberg thought of the big Orange and Blue team which catised such havoc at Allentown last week Is
shown,b'^' the following clip- ping fro
mthe,"Muhlenberg Weekly. Incidentally, it is very fairly writ- ten, and shows that true Ideals of sportsmanship are being lived up to at the Allentown college. Bucknell brought their far-fam- ed football team to Allentown last Sat\irday and after sixty minutes of play against the Cardinal and Gray, it was agreed by all present at the game, that the team had fully lived up to its press dispatch repu- tation. The final score wav 43-0. the 'argest score rolled up against .Muh- lenberg on the"
home,"field in the last fifteen years. Bucknell presented a wonderful team, consisting of a heavy line and backfield. but unusually fast, a team well-drilled in teamwork and u.^ing splendid interference. Bowser at full- back, was easily Bucknells star,"
mak,"ing four touchdowns and a 43 yard field goal. All credit must be given the Bucknel Iteam which played a hard, clean game."
Few,"penalties were inflicted, all being on technical grounds. Despite the evidence of the score, the .Muhlenberg team, shoved sftatches of Its old-time brilliancy. The team started the"
game,"minus Wills, Lewis and Parks, but all thre>>> soon got in. Wills and Feldman easily shared the honors for the day with superb tackling. Feldman saved"
many,a touchdown
when,"he alone stood between the runner and the goal posts. Wills, despite an injured shoulder,"
made,"tackle after tackle on the line, and twice did the unusual feat of passing the ball on Bond"
who,punted. Wills being the first
man,"to nab the runner where he caught the ball. Freitag. Crowley, Parks and Lewis also shone. Bticknell started off in the very first quarter, obtaining the ball on a fumbel by Anderson, after he had dropped on the ball on the five-yard line. Bucknell went clean"
down,"the field for a touchdown, repeating the process six times in the game. In the second quarter. Bow.><or kicked a frat'ernltl^. and interv'lsTting will be I beautiful field goal from the 43-yard The first half of tlie tcni* match between the faculty and the Varsity tennis team was played last week"
when,the young
men,defeated their older opponents in doubles by th<; score of three matches to one.
The,"singles matches of the tournament were not played due to the lateness of the day. They will be finished at an early date. Professors Balltntine, Rassweller. Rockwell and Mr. Bur- roughs upheld the honor of the fac- ulty and ISrandt. Purnell, Gray and Koch played for the Varsity. This match"
was,the Initial appear- ance of Purnell and Gray on tln' school tenni.s team. Purnell was out for the team last year and displayed real merit at that time but such re- cent improvement in his playing ha;! warranted him a place on this year's team.
The,other
new,
man,"on the team. Gray, is a"
member,of the Fresli
man,class and bids well toward hold- ing
down,fourth place on the team.
He,"i.s rather undeveloped as yet but shows promises of becoming a val- uable man. Profei<<sor Ballentine played with his usual excellent form and with his partner, Mr. Burroughs succeeded in cau.sing a strenuous match against Brandt and"
Koch,"which the under- graduates finally managed to annex by the scores. 6-3, 11-9. After this match ,the Ballcntine-Burroughs combination defeated Purnell and Gray In a hard fought match, 7-5, 5-7 and 9-7. Profe.';sor.'3 Rockwell and Rass- weiler lost their matches ^ut put up strenuous opposition in both. They were defeated by Purnell and Gray,' 6-3, 6-3 and by Brandt and Koch. 6-4 7-5. Most of the games in this last match were deuce as the *Prof.s"" came back strong after losing the other match."

many,"of whuin were attired in ilallawe'en costumes which varied from the wee little girl to the old maid \\ith spec- tacles perched on the end of her nose. Once in the dining room, it took the cla8.ses but little time to get started on til' ir various songs and chi-ers which were led by the clasi^ presi- dents; namely Seniors. Emily Devine, Juniors, Jennie Burke; Sophomores, Louise Hood; Freshmen, Elizabeth Walkei. The Freshies in their story lamenii'd the fact that they must al- ways step aside for Sophs, and must also ^"" without hair nets and th*; Sophomores response was ""You'll save yiMir"
money,"and your necks if you Just watch your step."" The Jun- iors"
made,"the air lively with the songs <if the Class of '22 and the Sen- iors displayed the usual pep and spirit tor which the Class of '21 is m.te^. Veils were even given for ""Chief"" and ""Bill,"" the"
watchman,"and janitor of the ""Sem."" Ghost.-, and Goblins',"
my,
how,"they shrieked as they greeted the girls on their arrival in the cemetery: Yes. the cemetery, for that la what a cer- tain portion of the"
gym,"represented. Tombstones were about and on them were .signs such as ""Reserved for Sunday Night."" Another end of the"
"""gym""",was as a farmyard with the stone well in the center of it. Dancing was enjoyed and then caine^he class stunts. The Seniors reprelinted a dining table in the Wuman'.s Cflllege with the usual
"""Sem""",gossip.
The,"Juniors gave a ""Vampire sketch, while the Sophs presented a musical comedy and a production of ""The Three Bears,"" ""Tiny"" Hazen playing the role of the little wee bear. The Freshmen gave an interpretation of ""Paul Revere's Ride,' 'which the judges deemed the best of all the stunts. After a bit of dancing"
came,the grand march led by Frill and
Frown,and then the prizes were awarded for the costume.'-.
The,prize for the most original was given to
Myra,Efflnger

manner,"in which the affair was carried out under the direction of Emily Devine,. '21 as President and the various heads of the commit- tees"
who,"were Matilda Bell. '21. .Mary Appleman, '22 and Majorle Sproiit, '21. Starting with a dance on Friday night and ending up with a big din- ner at the hotise on Sunday, the Phi"
Gams,held what

The music, furnished by ""Diffy's Collegiate Five"" was all that could be asked in the line of I ""jazz"". Its peppy syncopation being a feature of the dance.

CONCERT.,"U^ing only four different plays, the jieavy Orange and Blue football team rolled plucky St. Bonaventure in defeat Saturday on the local grounds by a score of 51-0. The"
game,"was better than the score indicates and some real football was displayed during the last quarter,"
when,tht scrappy visitors 'held the big team scorele.<<s. There v.as no parth ulaar individual star in the
game,although the whole Bucknell backfield dis- played some unu.-ual speed and Une- bucking ability.

was,a worthy

The Glee Club plainly showed the results of their nightly practice which h>>ve been held during the past two weeks. One .selection. ""Hunters Bold and Free,"" rendered by the entire organ- ization was most acceptable to those present."
A,vocal solo by Hobart
Brown,"en- titled. ""The .Magic of Thine Eye.-,,"" was also most favorably received. Brown's rich baritone completely filled the church and was decidedly one of the best numbers of the even- ing. Finley Keech's usual humorous ""line"" accompanied with his clever sketches also proved a huge success."
The,"quartette were graciously re- ceived in lieu of their rendition of ""Drink to"
Me,"only with Thine Eyes"" and ""Twas Eleven o'clock."" The quartette which is composed of Hartz, ,Hartz, Cloward and Appleton shows promise of large development and should be one of the features of the Glee Club. Robert Hartz's Interpretation of ""Meditation"" from Thais was extre-"
mey,well performed. Hartz used a mute on his instrument which pro- duced an effect extremely well pleas- ing to the ear.

The,"music furnished by Quinns orchestra tingled the toes of all from the first ""fazz"" to the last strains of ""Good Night Ledies. Feature dances were numerous."
The,"hurling of streamers, the snapping of snappers, and vividly colored hats helped in the expressing of the spirit of the night.

made,a pretty touchdown on a forward pa.ss. Julias
who,held
down,"the other end of tht line, showed up unusually well, keep ing his eye on the bdll at all timet and getting some difficult tacklee. ""Tiny"""
Homan,"and ""Pie"" Morrett played their usual steady"
game,"at their line positions, while Biehl ruin- ed one St. Bonaventure center t>> such an extent that his passes were all wild, causing his removal."
Mas,Reed pulled one of the surprises ol the
game,
when,he caught the
baM,"on a poor kick-off and ran it back 30 yards before he , was downed. Dooley. the skyscraping tackle, smeared play after play, and his har<< playing caused"
much,consternatlo* in the
camp,of the enemy. The
game,started
when,Bowser kicked off to the St. Bonaventure
SS,"yard line, and one of the visitor* ad- vanced the bail ten yards. Bucknell settled"
down,"to work, and did IMJ* give an inch of ground, forcing tkd visitors to punt."
Mangan,received the ball and carried it ten yards
befow,he was downed. Ko.-^tos
made,"t<<m yards, and"
Mangan,"five througk right tackle, and Wilsbach five more through right guard. Kostos, Bowser and Wilsbach each took another tur>> at the ball, and then Bowser carri-d* it over the line for the first itmck-"
down,"of the game. In actual timt, this took less than for.r minutes. Al- ter this touchdowns"
came,thick

The,"second touchdown was score* after Bowser had pulled off a pretty j 30 yard run and Wil.-bach, Kof<<to<< and"
Mangan,had carried the
baX,",down to near the goal line, aftef ' which Wilsbach obligingly carried It 'across. During the procession"
dowK,the field Julian
made,"a pretty resue(c) of the ball after Rostov had fumbled,"
Mangan,"kicked the goal. In fact,"
Mangan,added materially to tlM score by kicking all the goals except one. and McDermott did the honor* that time. In this san\c period BiU. had the St. Bonaventure center 9>> worried that he threw
many,"ba4 passes. One of these sailed far oT<<r the head of the St. Bonaventure ful^ back, and rolled acros.- the goal liae."

DEBATING,In an article printed under the Student's
Forum,"of last week's issue a student expressed regret at the de- cline of debating in Bucknell. 'Why,' he says, ""wor.ld it not be advisable for the school authorities to take a hand in the matter, giving some offi- cial recugnition to those"
who,"would elevate the mental standard of th-^ Bchool and have a share in bringing honor to the ins^titution?"" In Buck- nell's case the question is already amswered. Bucknell does give official recognition to her debaters in the form of a debating B, similar to our athletic B. Insitnia for last year's team have been ordered and will be issued by Francis Reamer, manager of that team, at an early date. Granting that Mr. McAdoo's ob.-^er- vatlon concerning the decline of de- bating in college is correct, in the cat^e of Bucknell with"
whom,"does tho fault lie? The triangular debatin;; league of last year, between Bucknell Dickinson, and Penn State, showed that Bucknell has the"
making,of a debating team. Arrangements aie
now,being
made,for this triangular league to be continued this year and for dual debates to take place with other Eastern colleges. Profe.ssor Rassweiler
now,has a promising clas.-. In advanced debating and the same time la able and willing to give aid to any one
who,"wi.'^^h to try out for the team. At a meeting of the debating hoard, held October iHth. Ellis Smith '21 was elected manager and Wra. Sugden '22 assistant manager of this year's team. Debaters of high chool or college experlenro and any"
who,are Interested in debating are urged to hand their names to one of the managers or to Professor Rass- weiler without delay.
The,"college has recognir^ed debating, the board is^ or- ganized and ready for business the only element remaining for a succes-s- ful debating year is the interest and participation of the student body. ^0"
A,
PLEA,
rOR,
THE,
MODERN,"minds on problems of the elghtenth century or onthe problems of the twientieth century the more import- ant to UB? In short. "" Is not the study of contemporary literature as impor- tant as that of classic literature?"" Let"
UB,see in what contemporary literature consists. Of late years fic- tion has been the most prolific form of literature. Still more lately has sprung
up,the short story. Professor Fries has ex- pre.s.sed the opinion that a new age of drama is about to dawn. In this per- iod of world reconstruction there should be just as spontaneous an out- burst of poetry as has succeeded every great
war,of world history. In response to the situation two
new,courses have been added to our cata- logue. Last years English
A,"course came as an innovation and as a shock to some of our educators. But Pro-ie Fiction, the outgrowth of English A. and a course In the Modern"
Drama,have
come,to stay. Having admitted the importance of eontemporary literature to this ex- tent let us see what the University has to offer to hose whose curriculum does not include these two courses? Aside from current magazines the showing is pitiful. Over in and above of the library
two,"small sections, in dust and di.sorder, represent our en- tire collection of fiction .Less than twenty of these have been written within the twentieth century. Great authors of modern times such as Winston Churchill, Henry"
Van,"Dyke,, John Galsworthy, and"
H.,"G. Wells, are represented by one or two books each, Harold Bell Wright, Zane Gray, and"
Gene,"Stratton Porter, acknow- ledged by the Freshman question- aire of reading as the most popular American novelists, are not repre- sented at all. Foreign novelists are almost unrepresented. Other forms of modern literature are totally missing."
No,collection of worthy contemporary drama or of contemporary verse is found in our library.
W(c),"offer these observations more as a plea than as a criticism. Where- ever the blame lies, it should be rem- edied unless"
we,are to concudle that the
muse,"of literature, and hence the muse of thought, suddenly died about fifty years ago, something should be done and that right quick- ly."

Mangan,
who,
made,a fine :]>> yard run. Bowi^er and Kostus started to take the ball
down,"the field, but Bowser grew tired of fool- ing, and, putting his head down, ran almost 30 yards for a touchdown. In this same half McDermott, in a very difficult play, scored another touch-"
down,on a well thrown forward pass. Shortly after this the half ended. The second half started off with a bang
when,Bowser received the St. Bonaventure kick-off and ran 35 yards before he was downed.
Mangan,"got off several pretty runt, and uitli Bowser and Kostos, carried the ball within scoring distance, where Wils- bach"
came,to the rescue and carried it over the line for the sixth touch-
down,of the game. Another touch-
down,was .scored in this period
when,Bowser ran 25 yards to cross the goal line. The line-up

common,"circumstances h<' repre.-ent.s them as being normally Intelligent, God-fearing, and gentle- manly. It is in the daily assemblage for worship that the author turp'^ loose his Imp Perverse."
He,tells a strange tale of young
men,
who,nic normally well conducted coming into this chapel >crvlce stamping and fihouting. Educated gentlemen are represented a.-; .singing harmonicju-^ and unharmoniou.s chords in uni.-on with the chord struck on a piano a-
a,signal for silence.
Men,
who,are musically gifted are seized by the
Imp,"and refuse to sing or el.se shout discordant notes. ChristiHn gentl""- men, under the spell, keep up an \\n- dertone of conversation slurring re- marks about the leader, or actual profanity while the word of God 1-^ being read."
Many,
who,are seldom ac- customed to open text books are stimulated liy the
Imp,with a violent desire to study during the devotional service. Other bright wide-awake fel- laws are rfpres<'nted as suddenly feeling the dire need of a nap. To <^ap the climax the author credits the
Imp,with ex'iting such a desire to return to recitations that young gen- tlemen push
and,"trample on the heels <if young ladif ^ in leaving the chapel. Thl.s story, acocrding to unauthen- tic tradition is supposed to have been refused by the publishers as being untrue to life in the American col- - leges of this day. ."

ADVERTISING?,Everybody appreciates the spirit
shown,at Bucknell by the chalking on the floors.
However,"some care seems to be lacking, in several re- spects."
The,"Cla.ss Memorials hardly seem a fitting billboard. The stairs in .Main Building also .seem to have re- ceived an over-abundance of the coral product. It seems fitting to say that the top of the stej^s might be chalked, becau.se there it will soon disappear. The sides of the tpcps, however, present an entirely dif- ferent side of the Issue. There the chalk must stay until the janitor scrubs it off."

OUR,
NEW,
SPIRIT,"The Following article written by ""Bobby Waddell, '20, and published Ina Pittsburg paper expresses to"
my,mind the
new,"spirit of Bucknell , ""Bucknell is no longer a trial horse for the big colleges."
We,"have a big team this year, and we are startiiii^ to grow."
We,had more students than
we,could handle
when,college opened in September.
Many,"extra acres of land have been acquired lately upon which to build. Athletics at Bucknell have been carried along just so-so, b\it there Is a revival on and it won't be long until"
we,will be up with the loaders.
Vou,
know,"it doesn't tak.^ long to get to the top these days."""
BOOST,"Tliere are a certain few wet blankets in every institution In th"" country whether that instituticMi Ix prison, asylum, hospital or school and in Bucknell"
we,have our few
who,have long since adopted the
"common,",ordinary
hammer,as their mainstay of equipemnt. These few fellow beings refuse to turn the doud.s inside out. They seem to feel that the only difference between school and jail if tliat in jail you have hopes of shortening you'- sentence while in school you
work,only for clemency. They hover over every bit of sunshine ready to swoop
down,"and destroy it like a bunch of hawks. Thoy set up a wail at every opportunity, equal to that of the hound dog in Huckleberry Finn,"
wh,.sat and howled at the
moon,"becau.sH it was bright. These fellows accomplish nothing,"
amount,"to nothing, are are wortli nothing minus to the school and to their fellow students."
The,"hamni'r is a great instrument for driving nails but a poor one for driving a- head. Con<<tr""'tive cirticl'^m has ac- complished wonders, l)ut destructive criticism has never accomplished any thing. Let's get together and learn to take things as they come. Forget about the thorns on the roses, think only of the fragrance of the blossom. If things are going"
wrong,don't sob. but get out and change them. Be alive and smile a bit and strive to
make,"your surroundings the brighter for your pre.-ence. Remember, an optimist i.--- a person"
who,sees a light where there isn't any and a pessimist la a person
who,blows it out. so look about you and see the lights of opportunity and then cast aside your
hammer,to lend your ef- forts toward a better Bucknell. *21

summer,with signal success
--,so go the reports re- ceived.
"""The","course is still in an experi- mental state,"" says Dr. Hunt,"
who,is in charge of this department.
"""What","we are attempting is to determine for ourselves the vahie of the mo- tion piclvue as an air to instruction in biography, hl.<<tory and whatever other studies lend themselves to pic- turization."
The,"course in the writing and construction of the photoplay, given under Mr. Patterson, take"
up,the motion picture from on entirely dif- ferent angle.
"""We",are going to try to teach those students
who,
show,"talent the actual technical points connected with the writing of photoplays,"" said Mr. Patterson."
"""We",have our labora- tories for this right In the motion picture theatres of the city and in our
own,"cla.^sroonis, where from time to time"
we,
show,current films
and,at- tempt to analyze them from all point- tliat could be of Interest to writers for the screen. This will include all of the camera tricks and devices. The student must have a pretty fair

Day,"was llttlnsly cele- brated at Hucknell tlil.^ year with special .services at the Baptist church, a parade, the annual Fresh-Soph foot- ball Kamc, a scrap that was not sched- uled in the catalogue of events, and a general good time in the evening at fraternity smokers. Dr. Hariis and President"
Hunt,"made appropiiate ad- dresses at the church in the morn- ing, and the parade was al.so carri^-d out, with Troop"

Wednesday,"<vonJng thn Sophomores gathered at the flag pole on the campus, and there\ipon"
hung,a red bann^'r bearing the numerals of 1923. This
was,"carefully guarded by armed ,-i'ntries all night long, and as an extra precaution the top part of the pole was greased after the fltfipr had \>i''U run up. Hui<ky Sophs, perch('<i in the rungs of the pole wil!i paddh isnd long pieces of Iron pipes, kept rareful watch, while others walked posts in true military fashion armed with an assorted collection of artillery."
No,"attempt, however, was made by' the Frosh to lake the flag down."
A,short time before the
game,wafl called the big green horde swept
down,"from the hill and surrounded the flag pole, pulling all the Sophs in reach to the ground, where others sat upon ihem to keep"
them,"out of the conflict. The two underclasses bat- tled mightily for nearly twenty min- utes,"
when,"""Art"" Harries and ""Dick"" Mason decided it was time to call the gahie.

made,"up in fight what they lacked in weiglit, and put up one of the best battle.s of its kind ever played on the local field. The Sophs also had the ad- vantages of the breaks with them, and had it not been for some hard luck on the part of the first year"
men,the Soph score would have been nine points less.
An,interesting feature of the
game,was the unusual
number,"of forward passes attempted by both .-ides, several of which worked to perfection. For the Frosh, back-field honors were evenly divided between Ken- ning, Bellak and Seybolt, whilf Coene, Larson, JennLson and"

He,played a remarkable

A,
number,of stndont.s and profes- flora
have,been lamenting the fact that there wa.-; no longtr a literal y .--o- clety in Bucknell where students *would spontaneou-iily show their ap- precTation of literature and art.
What,"people do with their leisure time is the test of their character.^ and taster. It would certainly be unfor- tunate if Bucknell would fail to (l.- velop a taste for the true and tlie beautiful. So an efort is being made, not to reorganize the defunct literary socie- ties, but to provide a plane, a time, a means, whereby the who!'.' University can function culturally, a sort of open forum, to be called th-' Buck- nell Lyceum. It is proposed that it be- co-education having, be.iides the J t- erary and musical portions of the program, a perfectly democratic, unlve.^ity broad social feature. The plan will be explained at a .-^pecial meeting to be hold in Bucknell Hall Wedn^-.^day Nov. 17. at 4:3l> P."
M.,"Ther"" will be special music, and an addr.-' iiy Pi of. A. L. Ilerold. Other memt)>>r.-' of the facilty and student body will tipeak. and if it meets the aproval of those pre.^ent, oficr.-s will bf fU-'cted."

BOWSER,"(From Page One) P. Reynolds saw his possibilities and held him out of several important games, and then put him in on the line In order to arouse"
him,to lii.^ greatest effort.
He,stands today as one of the greatest fullbacks in the country. I
He,has been the outstanding Indi- vidual performer In every
game,"tlibn year. ""Bow.ser is an all-round iOotl)all j player. His ability is not contined to particular phases of the game."
He,"performs equally well as a kicker, line-plunger, open-field runner, for- ward passer and defensive man. His line plunging and open-fleld run- ning are very spectacular. Seven of his eight touchdowns against Ur- sinus' and Mublenburg were made by straight line plunges, within their 10-yard lines, where the defense 1.^ always the stiffest. The eighth was"
made,on a crossed signal.
Wheu,"he found, himself in possession of tlie ball, with no one to receive It from him, and no Interference, he dug out for himelf, and unaided, tore thru the entire Muhlenburg team, shak- ing off a half dozen tacklers and car- rying the ball flfty-flve yards to the goal line. His kicking ability allows oppo- nents scant reason for any feeling of security."
He,"sends klckoffs high into the air and rarely drops them shurt of the goal lin(;. IIl.^ punts are ', usually forty-flve or fifty yards, and kicks the ball high enough to allow | the ends ample time to ge,t"
down,"the I held and d^jp the receiver in his | tracks. Hi;, ability to accurately di- lect placement kicks between the ; goal posts from any distance less than half the length of the fi'ld, , makes hi.-, team dangerous every timo ' they pu.sh the ball into their"
own,I territory. I Playing as a defensive halfback. I not a single play has tot past him in the four games playi d th'^i year. In seviuai insianct ;ie ha.- ' crossed to the other side of the lino ' and stopped the runner on nfi-tackh- i plays.
He,has also knocked
down,"' every forward pais which bii.i been | points which Bucknell has piled up as against their opponents' 14."""

The,"liiHt nieetlnB of the Mechanical EuKlneering club Htudentu wau one of the best In the history of the or- ganization. Professor Burpee had charge of the meeting, and the at- tendance of tho Elootrlcnl Engineers' JSociety swelled the aiicudanco."
The,organizations were addreased by Mr. N.
O.,"Reintckcr,"
who,"Ih, at present, the superintendent of operations of the rennwylvanla Pawer and Light"
Company,at Allentown.
He,"spoke of power stallons in general and then touched upon and explained ""Super- power"" syHtems and statlonB. H<* spoke more In detail of the steam boiler operation end of the"
game,an;l explained the details of the 2500 h. p. boiler located in the Detroit Kdi- son Company's plant in Detroit with
whom,he was employed during their construction. These are the largest und most powerful of their kind in the wor^^. His talk was very Interesting and tntertaining. and his inforniation lirst-hand and concise. Mr. Relnicker i.s blessed with a pleasing personality and can give the Information he pos- sesses in such a
way,that one can hardly help hut understand It.
He,"is a Cornell graduate, class of"
191L,and has
had,"very wide and varied exper- ience in the line of power plants. ID- was employed by the Uetrolt-Edi.'^on people during the construction of their big,"
new,"plant, and aso by th<' Newl York-Edison Corporation. Dur- ing the war, he wa.s employed by the Old Hickory Powder Plant. In Ten- nessee, and since then has been sup- erintendent of the"
company,In whoso employ he
now,Is. At the conclusion of his talk lie answered
many,"Questions arising from it, and before leaving he offer-ii to"
come,"again and give another talk. Mr. C. ^^. Bell, Superintendent of the Milton plant"
was,also the guest of the associated socletle.^i.
The,"presence of both of these gen- tlemen was due to the effort and iu- Fouitli (|iiarter With (idanhc clear of the Held, Smith hatted"
down,a pass that looked as If It would surely have resulted In a touch(h)wn Seybolt Intercepted a forward but wa.s
downed,on his five yard line.
Whon,he attempted to kick <<nit of danger the pass wont wild and by the time he had recovered the ball.
Hahn,"tackled him behind the line for a safety. The ball was brought out to the twenty yard line, and on th.> very first play, Seybolt nailed a for- ward and got awiiy for twenty more."
An,aerial- Bellak to Drory
--,
was,"Kood for ten nujre. But the Frosh at tempted to u.^e the air line once too often, and the next was Intercepted by Dayhoff. The Sophs"
came,"right back with the same stuff, and Udan- iec to"
Wrenn,netted twenty yards. After another attempted forward th'>
game,ended with the ball on the Frosh forty yard line. Final score. 16-0.

DECISIVE,"According ;o a di.-patcli In last Sunday's PuljJic Ledger, Bucknell has not defeated Dickinson since 1907. Acocrding t< * ir statistics, this seems to"
show,a 0* r-iderable lapse of
mem-,"ory on the pr.rt of somebody. At any rate, it i.-* tiine that D!ckin.-^on comes to a decislvt let-down, and it up to Oaptain Ivo.st< .-*' aggregation of fight- ing wildcat., t ) .see that the job is properly don*:."
From,"what happened to Gettysbu;,., not long ago, the proepects seorn pretty good, but every wtudent should try to arrange to see the game, and .see that these idle boastings ai^ ""piped down."""" Dlckin- uon has no n,*^an team, having de- feated AU'e^-h.ny 6-0. and making good .scores ar.ulnst other teams. LEURt""s go to Williarr-->>ort and see the team *win."

LYCEUM,
COURSE,"Lewisburg, Penn.<<iylvasla, as a col- lege town ha its advantages and It- draw-backs."
We,are all acquainted *with the familiar prai.-^e of its vir- tues. It is a qu'ei little country town removed from t'le distracting life and activity of the busy cities. It is an ideal nook in -.shich to shut ourselves
up,"from the h rrying world a^d en- gage in the finer pursuits of the in- tellect. Very veil for our immediat.' cour.-ies, h\it -hat of our other inter- ests? While"
we,"are engaged in our quiet retreat the world is moving by at a terrific rate. St-adents of the city colleges keep in touch with the mod- ern world during their hours of re- creation, durin;; the hours"
when,the student relaxes: iiis mind from his in- dividual pursuits of study.
What,has Lewisburg to offer to the student in his hours of :ela-;ation? The student .lio seeks a good eve- ning of entertainment in the town of Lewisburg ha.- a sorry time of it.
Two,"places of p'ibl;- entertainment are offer h1, the pi >1 room and the movie;"

The,fact is that Lewisburg ca.iii'ii support a good theatre. The . ize and character of the town prohibits anything in the

Armeg,"Shall the American collages let the twenty-flrst of next December pa.ss witTiout any recognition by pageants, plays tableaux or ceremonials of any sort? Are American institutions of learn- ing to permit the Pilgrim Tercen- tenary to go unobserved,"
when,"for this three hundredth anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers there have been prepared, as never before, both the materials and the methods of observing the Day by striking oomnuinity activities? The opportunity of linking hitsory with"
drama,"and pageantry lies be- fore hundreds of American colleges and universities which can translate to the present day the historic events and epl.sodes of 1620 that are com- memorated in this harking-back to the great early adventure in Amer- icanism. The three hundredth anniversary of the ttrst American legislative as- sembly and of the signing of the I'il- grims"""
Mayower,Compact will take concrete form through an extensive program of dramatic activities pre- pared a.-^ early as la.'^t winter through the bureau of educational dramatics of
Community,"Service, Incorporated. During Ut20 this program has been distributed freely throughout the country to churches, colleges, schools, libraries, club.i and <ommunities. One noteworthy pageant, having intellectual sub.'.^tance and rare artis- tic beauty, which"
may,"be adapted as a Masque in American colleges is en- titled, ""ifaleigh, Slieplierd of the Ocean. "" it was produci-d in C3ctober at Raleigh,"

may,"be locally adapted to other placcjj. Players from the Folk Theatei of the University of North Carolina, together with several hundred citizens of Raleigh prestnt- cd it as a comnninlty enterprise and as part of North Carolina""s Pilgrim Celebration."
A,"spectacle play of exquisite work- manship which Includes a pageant of tile American iiiiiver.'^itles, and which. like the Raleigh masque. Is especially adapted to college commuiyties, is ""The King's Progress."""" by Constance Smedly Armfleld. This play deals with an incident in the life of the boy king."
Edward,

"""New","World- beyond the Seas' in the .Mayllower that is building at Southampton. Th-' play is noteworthy for Its pure Tudor English and its picturi/.ation of his- torical data. 'The Pilgrims."" a pageant pub- lislied in the April"
number,of the Woman'.s
Home,Companion was writ- ent by Constance D'Arcy
Mackay,"es- pcscially for the Tercentenary Cele- bration. This pageant deals with he early settlement of the Pilgrim.- at Plymouth, where on'e of the Pil- grims, half dreaming over hi.^ bcok. sees a vision of America in Hie fn ture years. Through this vision all the great"
men,"and wouK-n of Amer- ica appear, thus"
making,"the pagear' relate delinitely to the v/hole countrv. north, east, south and v,( st.

W.,"Presbry. ""A pa- geant of Pilgrims,"" by Esther Wil- llard Bates, and ""Faith of our Fath- ers'"" by Annie Russell IMavble, are two other pageants dealing with Puritan"
New,England. Clearly there lies before the Amer- ican college.- and universities un op- portunity and a duty.
The,"Pilgrims were the early seekers after freedom and light,"
and,the right to think and learn according to their desires and tenets.
The,American ccdlege today perpetuates the vision and th>> liigh ideuk of the Pilgrim Fathers. It is fitting that upon .Ai'Kiican cjllego soil the commemorative exercises of this Tercentenary should find special footing.

LOOKING,
BACKWARD,
The,footbal season is over. Last September
when,
we,came back to Buclcnell from far and near
we,"all turned out to football scrimmage, the"
team,"looked promisiug, hopes ran high. Coach Reynolds"
was,given ;t
welcome,which all but took
him,off his I'eet. Rou.-iing mass meetings placed the whole student body bchir.il their team. But
now,"that the sea- son is over, as the smoke beglnp to Clear from the field of battle"
we,can look back to see
what,
we,"have ac- complished. In spite of the fact that we were disappointed in our high hopes of ""beating Penn,"" in spile of the fact that our three great games were ""al- mcstp."" what is there in this year-; record which makes every Bucknell- ian proud of his football team'.'"
The,fact that our total of scores
amounts,to 244 as against 37 for our opi>' i:i^nts and the fact that no team scored more than one touch
down,on Us (luring the season .speaks for the consistent playing of the Orange and Blue eleven.
The,fact that at the back of our line-up stands a
man,
who,holds the second highest individual score in this years football records of America strikees a note of response In the heart of every Bucknellian.
And,the fact that every player re- Bpects his coach and every student Ib proud of his team nuikes Bucknell fofttball a imit to be reckoned with.
Back,"of our whole football organ- ization stands ""Pete"" Reynolds, th' greatest coach Bucknell has ever"
known.,
A,driver and a master he
com,
mands,the respect rather thati the familiarity of hi^ men.
The,"spirit with which his .equad does tho.se ""lour laps around the track and un- der the cold .'-howers"" after three hours of steady diill is the greatest tribute possible to his ability. His arrival in Lewisburg this fall, riding with President Hunt, in a cab"
drawn,
by,"a njob of willing students, was an Index of his place in the heart of Bucknell."
Behnd,
him,"have stood a host of loyal supporters, all responsible for the success of the .-reason. Graduato- Eianager Glass Kas filled his office honorably and well. Only those"
who,"have dealt with ""Art"" Harris as stu- dent comptroller"
know,what praise he deserves.
And,"""Bill"" Willman as manager- well, suffice it to say that Bill has"
managed,as only the 'Kal.ser' himself could. Last but not least in the iiiachine.
we,
may,"mention Cap- taia ''Joe"" KostoH"
who,silently fights his fierht with r^U fhf fight that is in him.
and,"who, thru"
many,hard
bumps,h&n never been permanently disabled.
And,finally in l)ack of the coach In previous years the
Xmas,vaca- tion
was,"of three weeks duration. School floi-cd on or about the 17th of December, and opened about Janu- ary (J. This year it is closing the 22. and opening .January Gth, or nearly one week later. I wonder"
why,vaca- tion is so arranged tills year? The other colleges and larger high schools of the east close Wednesday December 15. or not later than the 17th.
Why,can't Bucknell do the same and fall in line? In the negative
we,are told: Bucknell must have a certain number of days upon which
we,sliall hold classes to maintain her high standard. The wiiter
knows,"that otlier colleges open later in in the fall, have a vacation Just as long as our"
own,at Xnuii. and still dismiss at an earlier date in the spring. How- do they do It?
Do,"other colleges fall below the standard? Dec. 21, has been proclaimed a na- tional holiday, as the 300th anni- versary of 'the landing of our Pilgrim Fathcr.s. Will classe.4 be held upon that date? If classses are not held should cla.s.ses be resumed upon Tues- day and"
Wedneday,"following? If doesn't seem right. Students,"
why,not talk it
up,and endeavor to obtain a vacation from December 17th to January 6th? Lets all pull together.

CLUB,"There has recently been re-organ- ized in the University an organiza- tion that bids fair to place the word ""Bucknell"" before the eyes of its"

One of the big affairs planned by the club is a dance to be held in Wilkes-Barre during the Christmas vacation. This dance is not a strictly Luzerne County affair, and every Bucknell student is welc(une. Th<i Sterling Hotel Ball room has been en- gaged for the 27th of Dec. and a good orche.stra secured. The ccunmittee in charge consists of Janu!s Brown. Ray-"

THE,
TEACHER,
SITUATION,
From,Reports
By,Those
Who,
Know,
An,"impression prevails that th,' teacher shortage throughout tli.- United States is no longer a serious problem. Recent reports received from county and district .superinten- dents in every State clearly indicate that such a conclu.'^ion is erroneous. While the average condition is slight- ly better than last year, due to markt improvement in States where salari^/s have been greatly increaat. the gen- oral situation hemain'^ practically un- clianged. The numl)er of .schools with out teachers and the still larger num- ber tatight by incompetent teachers sho wthat a very serious situation still exists, particularly in those States where salaries are lowest."
On,"September 1, 1920. the Na- tional Association sent a letter to every county"
and,"district .superin- tendent of schools in the I'niled States, enclosing a retuin po.-^tal ( ard upon whieli were askt ten questions leuardinu the teacher situation in their respective counties. Tlie follow- ing is a tabulation of the replies re- ceived to thiee of the (juestions asked ( 1 ) The number of teaching posi- tions in the country or district cov- ered by the report; (2) the shortage of teachers at the opening of school in September, 1920; (3) the numl)e>>- of teachers below standarad"
whom,it had been neces.sary to accept in order to keep as
many,"schools as possible open. The standard referred to is. of cour.se, the"
minimum,"for the given county or district, and teacher.s be- low standard are admittedly incom- petent."
The,"real shortage i.-!, there- fore, the"
sum,"erf th"" actual shortage and the"
number,"of teachers below standard. Inrjuirics were .'^ent to 3,168 sup- erintendents and 1,492 replies had been received at the time this tabu- lation"
was,"nuide. Oetoijci- 12. very re- port is signed by the county or dis- trict superintendent nuiking it, and the infornuition is, therefore, the most reliable that can be obtained."
The,figuies given in the first five columns are taken directly from tlie signed reports.
The,"""estimated short- age and below standard"" given in file last column is based on the assump- tion that the unreported counties of a State would show conditions tlie same as those reported. Unquestionably the greatest edu-"

MATRICULATION,
The,old custom of matriculation for
Freshmen,will be done
away,with entirely this year at Buckneli. In former years all Fre.shmen
who,"were receiving pa.ssing grades in tlielr work at the end of ten weeks, were required to sign a slip pledging them- selves to obey the laws and regula- tions of Buckneli University as long as they were"
members,of the same. Tile student was not considered a
member,of the institution until after matritulation. Last year a list of the Freshmen
who,were
up,in their
work,was post- ed at the
end,"of ten weeks, but this year the list will not be posted."

FRATERNITY,
A,"local fraternity has, with Pres- ident Hunt's consent,"
made,Its ap- pearance at Rucknell under the
name,of Phi Theta Sigma.
The,nu\jority of the
members,of the fraternity have been in associa- tion for the past two or three years as a boarding club. Due to the friend- ship that has (existed
among,the club
members,"during this period, some"
new,"form of closer relatlonsliip was desired and although the promoters of the fraternity had dlscu.^sed the proposition at length last spring, no (iuflnlte steps were taken toward complete organization until the open- ing of school this fall."

Penn is not on the sched- ule at all but Muhlenburg, Susq\ie- hanna and Dickinson st'.ll remain. As can be easily seen, this list i;: considerably heavier than last 4'ear. but it is believed that with the pros- pective material in view, and the men from this year's team"

was,followed by a dance at which a twelve-piece orchestra furnished the music.
Any,one of the club can tell you what wonderful music was played by this twelve- piece orchestra.
By,"retracing Its steps somewhat, the club reached Wellsboro about noon on December 30. It was here ' that the club rechristoned the popu- lar song "".Margie"" so that its"
name,"became ""Vlrgie."""

game,"was close, but spoiled by the constant fouling by Susque- hanna, and the continual 'riding"" with hisses and remarks by the"
cowd,"for the calling of fouls on Susf4Ui- lianna, which to anyone knowinr, 'he game, were well deserved. ~'I'!ie pliiylug of the BuckueJl team was a great improvement over- that shown on our floor Friday night. V'v'ren ea,"";' d three licld g 'als and Julian and Bihl each one. Biiil made 1! oMt of 28 fouls. Rogowi^*^ for Susquehanna, had three field .-joals and Sweeney had two. The first half was very close, bein.g nip uiul tuck throughout. Buci(neirs lirst live points were scored on fouls, S tsquehanna's on two field ^oan and 1 foul."
A,field goal by Wrciin to- wards the end of the half put the Orange and Blue in the lea-1 vhich the .Selinsgrove five never overcame.
The,"half ended with Bucknell hud- ing, 9-7. In the second half Susquehanna kept fouling and Bihl continued mak- ing hall his tries.

GLEE,
CLUB,
TRIP,Krcjm
rage,One under the auspices of the senior class of the hl!;h school. It seemed that most of the concerts were given under the au.spiceK of high school .senior cla.sses endeavoring to raise
money,for a trip to Washington. It was in Port Allegany that some of the
men,"were quite affected by the natural .!?as, the hall being lit with that nas. Sunday night a sacred con- cert"
was,given in the church. Port Allcfrany deserves con.slderable
men-,"tion, for it was there that the lone *Turtle"" on the trip lost a pledge pin, while various others succombed lo the wiles of the .'^Irens of the town. Most of the"
men,mhssed
Sunday,"morn- ing'-- hieakfast, which i.s another fact of Interest. With but three more concerts ahead of them, the"
men,".'<et out to have a good time while it lasted, and at the same time"
made,the deter- mination to steer clear of all un- buckled. Happing arctics.
Monday,night
was,"spent in Kane, where after a sueco.ssful concert, the"
men,"wt^re introduced to the intricacies of three deep,"
"winkum,","and other such stren- uous games. Imagine playing such games in ""hoileriplute."" However, the"
men,
came,"out unharmed,"
and,also
made,the acquaintance of .several Bucknell alumni. Bradford quite hypnotized the
men,"as ""Fin"" for one, can tell. Here a short program was given in the high school in the afternoon, while the concert in the evening was a big suc- cess from all points of view. Brad- ford had not forgotten"
"""Cy""","Hau.'s, as th<>y demonstrated"
when,he ap- peared for his popular songs.
The,last concert was given in Renovo on
Wednesday,"night,"
and was,"followed by a short dance. Shortly after mid- night the club entrained for Montan- don. where they were met and brought over to l<ewisburg. and back to work. Such a short account as this cannot hope to tell of the fine times, the close shaves, and the"
many,other things which went to
make,up the .second successful trip of the club for the current year.
From,"begin-' ning to end, every"
man,"enjoyed him- self thoroughly, and at the same time did his part in"
making,the trip a real adve rtl.se
me,nt for Bucknell.

Ann,"Arbor, Mich. As yet no definite"

who,the criminals are have been uncovered. The polhe believe it to be the
work,of professional thieves and not thai of students. This in quite likely in 1 view of the large

Monday,evening
when,"the S. A, E, quintette and the Deme's Ave wrestled with the ball for a 20 to 17 score In favor of the Slg Alph.^, and the Non-Frats staged a good run-"
away,"against the neophytes from Phi ?jLc>ta Sigma, to the tune of 29 to 13. Willard Collins called to clash the"
S,
A,.E. and
Dome,"warriors promptly at 7:15, and the teams lost no time in mixing things"
up,in the old-time
manner,"which bids fair to provide as great an interest In inter-frater- nity as inter-collegiate basketball. Va'\\ live was lacking in smooth team work, due no doubt, to the small"
amount,"of practice they had in prep- aration for the contest. Both teams developed flashes of championship spirit under the cheering of the spectators, and if anybody looked good on the two teams it was Seybold for the S. A. E.'s and Walker for the Deme's. Both"
men,are centers and
members,"of the Fre.-hman cla.'^s. Fete Rooney shot five out of six fouls and then one out of three. Walker and Tingley in the first half failed to take advantage of the eight fouls committed against them. In the sec- ond period Foxall showed up better than did Bellack,"
who,did the S.
A.,E. tossing.
The,teams on the whole were well matched and more prac- tice will see .some very good material developed from the clubs. Between the periods of the first
game,the Non-Frats and the Phi Theta Sigma runnorr: got under
way,and showed a bit of team work. In the first half the Non-Frats got
away,"with a seven-point lead after Rob, a Freshman, was put In. Captain Treadwell's"
men,"scored 17 points to the 7 captured by the Phi Sigs in the second period. Miller scored well for the Non-Frats in the last fifteen minutes, dropping five two-counters through the net at Intervals frequent enough to"
dampen,"the spirit of ""come back"" which the opposition endeavored to stage."
The,tallys for the
game,"are a,s fol- lows."

A,few fussers ventured across the campus and enlivened the gallery. Slg Alphs blossomed out in brand

A,fair-sized crowd of spectators filled the chairs and the benches Captain Treadwell of the Non- Frats bossed from the side lines.

Two,On last
Wednesday,afternoon the Bucknell
Lyceum,held a very Inter- esting meeting at which about .seventy students were present. The program was one of an entire social nature and an atmosphere of real fun prevailed. It is seldom that the stu- dents get an opportunity to get to- gether outside of their respective groups and it was an opportunity that all
who,"took advantage of thor- oughly enjoyed. The presentation of ""The Three Bears"" was given with *Tiny"" Ha.^en as the ""little"
wee,"bear,"""
We,"can all imagine ""Tiny"" as the little bear and with her voice to match it certainly was a .scream. Laughter flowed free- ly during this number. ""Curly"" Lawson then rendered .several ditties accompanying himself on the banjo. They were very well given and ap- preciated by all. ""Tiny"" Hasen"
was,again featured in a
mock,opera scene from
Romeo,"and Juliet. ""Tiny"" had to keep up her established reputation and she certainly did. The crowd was then divided In half in a contest to see which sides could think of the most slang expressions in ten min- utes."
The,king's English
was,mur- dered. One side thought of about eighty ann the other about fifty. Anything from
"""Where","do you get that stuff,"" to ""Stand back, you'll get your money,"" was used. Sue Post then gave a reading entitled ""The Courtier."" It wius v.ell acted out and showed marked ability. The after- noon closed with the Hinging of sev- eral popular airs and was one of real fun. The next meeting will be held thi.s Wednesday afternoon"
when,an after- mjon will be spent with Rudyard i\ipllng. The whole school is invited and it is hoped that a large
number,will avail themselves of this oppor- timity.
"MAYPETERSOlT""",
SCORES,
BIG,
HIT,
May,"Peterson, the first of the art- ists presented in the course by"
Mu,"Phi Epsilon, delighted and captivated a very large audience last Friday ev- ening at the Bapti-st church. The soprano has made herself"
known,"as one of the most gracious and winsome of the younger singers befort' the public, both in concert and at the Metropolitan. Her voice Is beyond reproach in warmth, beauty and technique, and is always on pitch, a virtue of tew singers. Style, irreproachable taste and finish, combined with great"
mu-,"sicianship, impart to every phase of her"
work,a delicate distinction and great artistry. One of the charming things about her concert was the description she gave before her songs. It seemed to bring her audience closer and gave them a moie personal feeling towards the singer. Credit Is certainly due Stuart Roi^s for his finished accompaniaments. It is hoped that MLss Peterson will return for another engasement. The varsity basketball team
won,"but one of its three games on its trip, this from F."
&,
"M,",by a score of 2 to 14.
The,"other two games went against us, the Temple"
game,"by a close margin of 27 to 24, and the Swarthmore"
game,"by a larger margin of 21 to 11. The team's defence on all occasions proved strong, our weakness being in the offense, the forwards being weak in advancing the ball, as well as in shooting F. &."

THE,
TE.MPLE,
GAME,
The,"team played its best game of the season here, and well deserved a victory, because of the brand of ball shown. Temple, however, has a strong team, and was in tip-top shape."
The,
game,"was anybody's luitll the last ten minutes,"
when,"Temple shot in the lead with three field Koals. and was never overtaken althoush the Orange and Blue staged a strong fight. Bihl .scored our first 7 points on 5 fouls and a goal from field. Temple held us even with tAvo field goals and three fouls. Temple took the lead on two fouls, but Diet- rich's field goal tied matters up. Bihl's two fouls, and a field goal by temple kept the score even at 11, Each team .scored a foul, and Temple took the lead with a field goal. Day- hoff's field goal"

THE,
SWARTHMORE,
GAME,"The team displayed its poorest brand of basketball in this game, be- ing unable to break thru the rjppos- Ing offense with any amount of suc- cess, and being forced to resort to long shots, few of which were to any advantage. Our team played ragged ball the first half, scoring but 4 points, on lield goals, by Bihl and Dayhoff. ""Vic"" missed the only foul which"
we,had to shoot.
The,"opposing team, meanwhile, ran wild, getting C field goals, and 3 out of 11 fouls. The score at the end of the half was Swarthmore l.'>, Bucknell 4, The second half saw quite an im- provement in the playing of the Orange and Blue."
The,"defense tightened, Swarthmore scoring b>it one goal from field. Our delense was too"
weak,to overtake the opponents' lead.
We,scored two field goals and three fouls. The

W.,"Lees '20, C,"
A.,"Zeller '21, Mar- garette Fowler ex'23, Reynolds El- liott ex'lS, and Robert Grone ex'23. To those Bucknell students"
who,"attended the Student Volunteer Con- ven in Des .Moines last year, the an- nouncement of the coming of Sher- wood Eddy to this University will be retelved wtlh great pleasure. Arrangements have been"
made,"for Mr. Eddy to b- at Bucknell for three days, March 8th to 10th. Previous to th. Des Moines Convention he was engaged as one of the leaders in a r.allon-wlde campaign of evangeliza- tion for China and ho came from this work witli truly an inspiring message for the student body of America. Those wIh) were interested in the re- cent visit of Dr. Foster will look for- ward to his coming with more than usual interest. Sherwood Eddy has just returned from a campaign"
among,the students of Europe and the Near East.
He,made a special study of the social and lndn.strial problem In Europe during the present unrest.
He,"has held con- ferences with students of the Uni- versity of Berlin, and studied present conditions <n"
Germany,and Austria.
He,"was with the Poles in their la: t stand before Warsaw, flew with their flying squadron, and studied condi- tions"

On,Saturday morning last Mis.<< Elizabeth Peifer of the class of 192 4 met with an accident while coasting on the college hill.
The,recent snow and subsequent thawing and freezing had
made,ideal coasting and a large crowd of enthusiasts were taking ad- vantage of this opportiinlty to enjoy the sport. The smooth condition of the hill
made,steering a very
much,"more difficult task than ordinarily, so that"
when,the sled on which .Miss Peifer
was,coasting turned toward a tree she was not able to change its course.
The,"full force of the blow was fortunately turned aside, so that the side of Ihe lieau aiiu ilght .^houl der received the worst injury. Miss Peifer"
was,Immediately carried Into the
home,of Dr.
Hunt,and a phy.^iclan sent for. She was soon revived and after a thorough examination the physician gave a.ssuranco that no ser- ious injury had been sustained.

On,
Monday,"night Matilda Bell, '21."
who,"has .served so well during the past term, was re-elected to the offico of Student Ex. president. Nominations for the executive board iiad been made, as was tho custom, by llie nominating board, composed of the various class pre<<i- dent.H and the president and vico- presldent of Student Government. All was set for the election of"
thee,"nominees on Wednesday night,"
when,"to the surprise of many, and to the astoni,shment of the present ""student exes."" a motion was"
made,"to re-elect the present board. After .some discussion, which"
was,"mostly ""pro"" it was decided that the girls"
who,"act' d as ""chiefs"" durirK the past term should continue. This Idea of serving two terms is an en- tirely"
new,"one, having never been done since Student Government ha;^ existed at Bucknell. Therefore, this would show that the present ""student exes"" are indeed popular ones and should be highly complimented by the honor which the student body has conferred tipon them. The Board consists of Matilda, Bell, '21, presi- dent, F:mily Devine '21,"
Emma,Fuh- rer '21.
Emma,Kunkle '22. Ellza- heth Couffer '2 2 and Marjori- Nichols '23.

No,
money,"will be disptmsed v,itlioi:t the con- sent of Profe.s.sor Drum."
The,1922 L'Agenda has h en placefi on this status by the
management,in an effort to put the L'Agenda man- aecni'.nt in a different light in th* eyes of the student body. Hert-tofor.' the L'Agenda has been
more,or le>>? of a gamble with the management u^ually credited with
making,"untold nuv.dreds of dollars out of the bu.si-^ nesK transacted,"
when,such was noi the case.

On,"Thursday night three more games were played in the Tustin gym. ""Uoc"" Oerhart was on hand as ref- eree and his calling decision was miglity good."
The,first
game,was between the Phi Ivappa l\si's and th.'
Kappa,SIgs.
The,
game,started off with the Kappa Sigs on top but they were not able to hold tlie lead. Poor passing and muffs on both sides niarkt-d the first
game,for each team. Uunting was good on caging fouls and also did
some,clever floor work. The
game,grew close at the end of the first half and ended with a ttn-nin'. score and the Phi Psi's in the lead. The
game,"ondcfl 2 4-20 in their favor, ilaiin and Hol'fa played the best"
game,for the

manner,in which Mic
men,"put across the series of concerts in the absence of I'rof. Paul Stolz, the director of the dub,"
who,was unable to accompany the
men,"on the trip. Fired with their usual entluis- iasni, the men, under the able leader ship of Ilulph Hartz,"
manager,"of the club, staged ten successful concerts in nine towns in the northern coun- ties of the state. Manager Hartz, in ' the absense of the regular director, assumed that position, and filled both it and his"
own,place as soloi.st and tenor in the quartette in a highly 1 satisfactory nianner_
Much,credit is I due every
man,
who,"made the trip, I and especially to Manager Hartz for his part for the"
way,"In which they | [entered into the work. It was the' I first time in Glee Club history at I Uucknell that the club has opened, on a tour without a nieniber of the faculty accompanying them. I The factors contributing most I greatly to the success of the concerts were the cooperation shown by the"
men,and the spirit of responsibility oxhiliited. Each one seemed to real- ize that it was up to him to do his utmost to
make,things run smoothly in the ab.sence of Prof. Stolz. and that he must at all times enter into the work at hand with a will. The morale of the
men,"was also excellent, for, while the trip was be.set with difficultie.<<, such as poor traveling ac- commodations, getting up early to"
make,"train connections and .so on, there was not a"
murmur,"of discon- tent. Their being well-fed at all times doubtless had a great deal t(i 'do with keeping up the morale. I That the concerts were successful lis given added proof of a different ! nature when the letters of apprecia- tion which have been received by tln' manager arc taken into considera I tion. Letters of praise have been received from various towns, and 1 praise is both for the excellence of 'the concert work and for the excel- lence Qf behavior on the part of the men."
Many,"return concert dates for next year were booked as a result of the trip. At Port Allegany, the"
members,"of the club took entire charge of th'^ Sunday evening union services, in the Methodist church, after which a sacred concert was given. Another feature of the"
work,"of the club, which is carried out on every trip, was the securing of name-i of prospective students for Bucknell. The club is one of the best adverti-<- ing mediums at the disposal of th>^ University, as it Is ever talking up the University and urging h'gh school students to come here."
The,"club did not fail in this depa'tniont of its work on the recent trip. In fact, taken all in all, the recent trip was"
among,the most successful ui the history of the organization.

No,"class adnihssion cards will be issued to the student, but a list of students in each class will be presented to the professor in charge. Students are advised to verify their schedules bo there will be no confus- ion"
when,"classes open on February first On Friday evening, Junuary 14, from nine to three, the pledges of Kappa Chapter of Sigma Chi enter- tained the active chapter with a dance noteworthy for several fea- tures, namely, decorations, the luncli the splendid music by Diffy's College Five, and the appearance of Miss"
May,Peterson. Mis Peterson sang a few folk lore songs and told an in- teresting story. Her marvelous voice and attractive personality
made,her instantly liked by everyone. The decorating .scheme
was,that of blue. Throughout the house was hung artistically cut blue crepe. The .'^ame effect
was,continued by subdu- ing the lights with the same material.
A,lunch consisting of magnolia fla- vored Ice cream and golden cake covered with icing of the

week,"that beginning February 1, all sorority meetings will be held on Tuewday nights. Formerly meetings were spread out from"
Monday,"to ThurHday, each sorority taking a separate night which made it rather inconvenient, due to the fact that whenever a lec- ture,"
game,"or something of the sort was held, one sorority was at a dis- advantage. The idea of sorority meetings all on Tuesday evenings is doubtless a good one and will prove advantageous to the co-eds as well as the school in general."

AMER1CA;S,
NEEDS,(Printed by Request of the
U.,S. Treasury Department.)
The,"economic necesRitles of Amer- ica and the need for safeguarding the financial independence and safety of each individual citizen has deter- mined the Treasury Department to continue the issue of Government Savings Securities throughout 1921. according to an announcement by Secretary of the Treasury Houston. Those necessities, widely recog- nized"
among,college
men,have also committed the Treasury to contin- uance and Intensification of the work of the Savings Division of the Trean- ury In a broad campaign to
make,"saving, and safe Investment, a na- tional habit."
The,"savings securities of the gov- ernment, familiar in every house- hold, will be augumented In 1921 by two"
new,"Issues, a $1 Savings"
Stamp,and a |25 registered Treasury Savings Certificate. In announcing the issue of these securities. Secre- tary Houston says:
"""Two",
new,"Treasury savings .se- curities will be Issued during the somlng year, a $1 Trea.sury Savings"
Stamp,"and a $2 5 Treasury Savings Certificate. The |1 stamp will be non-interest bearing, will be bright red In color, imprinted on a green tint, and will bear the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first Secre- tary of the Treasury. The |25 cer- tificate will be similar In design and terms to the |100 and $1,000 Treas- ury Savings Cetrlficates, which will also be offered In 1021, to mature January 1, 1926. ""The"
new,"securities will supply a $1 unit for saving and a registered Government security In the |25 de- nomination, which can be conven- iently purchased through the accu- mulation of the $1 Treasury Savings Stamps. More Important still, the"
new,"securities will complete a most attractive line of Government sav- ings securities, the $1 stamp and the $25, $100 and $1,000 registered Treasury Savings Certificates, and thus place the Treasury Savings"
movement,on a solid peace-time ba.sls.
The,"small denomination war- time securities, the $5"
War,"Savings Stamp, in a 1921 series, and the 25- cent Thrift Stamp, will also be of- fered during the coming year. ""Notwithstanding the reaction since the arml.stlce from habits of saving, and the natural tendency during the past year to Invest funds In Liberty bonds and Victory notes at current market prices, the"
demand,for the savings securities has contin- ued strong in
many,"parts of the country. As the security markets become more settled. Treasury Sav- ings securities, bearing interest at 4 per cent compounded quarterly, ex- empt from State and local taxes and from the normal Federal income tax, and redeemable substantially on de- mand, .should prove Increasingly at- tractive to the multitude of small investors. With these considerations; In mind, the Treasury Is committed to the continued sale of Government sav- ings securities,"
and,"feels that as time goes on continuous sales of savings securities over the counter, at pot- offices and banks throughout the country, should play an increasingly important part in the current finan- cing of the Government. ""To this end, the Treasury Is also committed to the continuance of the"
work,"of the Savings Division, In Washington and in the several Fed- eral Reserve districts. This organ- ization endeavors to promote the popular purchase of Government Savings Securities; develops and pro- tects the secondary market for Lib- erty bonds and Victory notes and other"
war,"is.'<upR of Government .se- curities, and unites the efforts of all helpful agencies and movements, fi- nancial. Industrial, educational, com- mercial and social, in a broad .savings campaign to"
make,permanent habits of saving and Investment in United States Covernment .securities. It.s work along these lines will be Inten- sined in 19::i. 'The Treasury Savings
Movement,"has already demonstrated its useful- ness by its efforts to promote sound economic conditions throughout the j country and disseminate sound econ- omic doctrine. In fact, the work of the .Savings Divl.sion thi.<< year, not only in promoting the sale of Gov- ernment Savings Securities and in strengthlng the secondary market for Liberty bonds, but in establishing wide-spread habits of thrift and suv Ing, has been frequently recognized as meeting a great national need. That recognition has been strikingly emphasized by the requests of great national organizations that the sav- ings work be continued and by their offers of active cooperation In the movement. ""The work of the Savings Division has been splendidly successful In the .schools, with the children as well as with the leaders of educational thought In America. As a result, th<! committee of State Superintendents of public Instruction, which has just met in Washington, has decided to urge every State Superintendent and Commissioner of Education to Install thrift courses in every school and at the same time provide for the prac- tice of the principles taught by of- fering means for sound investment. ""In responding to these demands the Savings Division will intensify during 1921 its campaign to spread broadcast the essential facts relative to wise savings and spending and in- vestment and the continued develop- ment of"
new,"capital."""

won,from the Non-Frats.
The,contest
was,"full of surprises, the biggest be- ing the score, which was 18-22. Lonrr and Mussina brothers connected with the basket frequently enough to off- set the good work of Treadwell and Miller for the Non-Frats. Under the capable lead of Buck- nell's bandmaster the"
Lambda,Chi Alpha team succeeded In carrying off 'honors from the

The,final whLstle found the
Forum,"team but a few points behind and going strong. There was, however, great activity in Tuatln"
gym,during the week of February 1. Seven games of basket- ball were played in the Inter-frater- nlty league and some of them proved interesting. Phi
Kappa,Psi played three
games,during the week without a defeat and were still able to retain the honor of a clean slate.
They,"have plenty of material, have been playing a hard and fast"
game,"and are bidding strongliy for the handsome cup that will be donated to the win- ning team. The Non-Fraternity team also has a mighty fast aggregation, having suffered but one defeat In tho hands of Beta"
Kappa,Psl.
Much,de- pends on the results of the
game,be- tween these two teams.
The,"S. A. E. team, which began the sea-son by a series of victories, stands next in the list, but has recently suffered two defeats."
On,
Wednesday,night the first
game,was between the Beta
Kappa,Psi team and the Phi
G^mma,Delta team.
The,Beta Psl team carried off the bacon with a one-point lead.
The,"Phi Ganiri took the lead, .scoring ten points before the Beta Psl team got under way."
M.,Mussina missed Ave tries at fouls and then
Long,began to do the foul shooting for that team.
The,Beta Psl team took a spurt but were unable to catch the Phi
Gam,"team before the end of the first half, which ended with a 16-12 score."
The,Beta Psl team started the second half of the
game,with a rush and soon tied the score at 18.
The,
game,from there on was very exciting with first one team and then the other in the lead.
The,
game,ended in a 24-23 score with the Beta
Kappa,Psl team In the lead. Defflbaugh and Purnell played a fine
game,for the Phi Gam.s aud did uiost of their scoring nefl- baugh shot 7 out of 10 foul goals.
Long,and the two Mussina boys played a crack
game,for the Beta
Kappa,"Psi team. They were,"
how-,"ever,"
weak,"on foul shooting, caging only 6 out of 17 foule."
The,second
game,was of a milder nature between the Slgs and the Delta Slgmas. The Slgs kept the scoring pretty
much,"to themselves, winning by 21-8. The Slgs appeared in"
new,uniforms and Treadwell took over the refereeing Job. Woodrln;? played an all-round
game,for the Slgs and contributed largely to their victory.
The,Slgs scored 13 points before the Denils were permitted to score. Rosa threw a foul just before the whistle announced the end of the first half. At times the
game,tended to be a little rough. Tlngley caged 2 field goals and Rose shot 1 out of 3 fouls and Walk- er shot 3 out of 9 fouls for the Delta Sigma team. Jones and
Woodrlng,played a fln(c)^ all-round
game,for the Slgs.
The,
game,between the Phi Pel team and the S.
A.,
E,team held the senter of Interest. Neither of these teams had previously been beaten and it
was,lookd ou as a deciding gaem.

The,"second concert of a series of four, given under the auspices of tho"
Mu,"Phi Epsilon sorority,"
wan,given by Oliver Denton on Thursday ev- ening. February 3rd at the Baptist church.
The,"high musical standard set by the first concert, given by"
May,"Peterson,"
was,"in evidence again on Thursday evening. Mr. Denton at once charmed and delighted his audience with his clear, well-delined technique which !?avo him the greatest freedom in the in- terpretation of his program. Hi.s success with his audience"
was,evi- denced by the hearty applause which compelled
him,to give three encores. .Many people from the surrounding towns were present and the diurch was well tilled. Those
who,have failed to attend these two concert^ have surely missed two of thp best musical treats that have been given here in
many,a day.
Two,"more con- certs still remain of this series Ra- faelo Diaz, a tenor of the Metropol- itan Opera company, will give a re- cital on February 15th, and Tlielnia Given, a violinist, on"
March,"3rd, will give the last of the. series. Both of these musicians are of the highest rank and the music-loving public Pan not afford to miss them."
The,
Mu,Phi Epsilon sorority of Bucknell university deserves a f^reat deal of credit for undertakings tho task of securing these musicians with the financial risk envolved.

On,"Friday night last the campus at Bucknell echoed with the shouts and shrieks of the ""Semites"" as they witnessed the games between the girls from the var!ou<< women's build- ings. Faculty and students filled tho gym, all out to cheer ou their teams."

It was good basketball, too. since tho fair ones did not indulge in anv hair-pulling, and there were no knock-outs. Boys' rules with girls' guarding rules was played, which added a great"
amount,"of ""pep"" to tho"
game,"and at the same time prevented any so-called ""rough house."""
As,to tlie
game,"itself. Main ""Sharp Shooters"" had a hard time guarding Forwards Fuhrer and Scholl. as they caged ba.sket after basket. Elva Horner did good work for ""Main"" until Emily Devine went In as guard and from then on she found It rath<<>r hard to locate the basket."
The,"work of C. Conrad at guarding. Darl Davis. Main's snappy forward, and also the playing of Domsalskl, Wunkerburg. Jack and"
Keough,
was,worthy of mention.

Turn,to Page Three Running even with the Getty.sburg
game,of the
week,in respect to being the most exciting
game,"seen on our floor in years, wa.s the Bucknell-Al- bright"
game,of January 28th. Haps Benfer's live was defeated by a score of 28 to 23.
The,"two biggest factors in defeating Albright were the five field goals by Dayhoff and the re- markable foul shooting of Bihl, he"
making,"14 out of 17 tries. Tht- op- posing foul shooter, on the other hand,"
made,5 out of 16.
The,".scoring during the first half ran even, with the visitors ringing six goals from field,"
many,"of which were sensational shots, to our three. Our eight successful fouls to Al- bright's three"
mode,"up for the differ- ence caused by tho field goals. All this half the score see-sawed back and forth with one or two points dif- ference, and the half ended with the Orange and Blue on the short end of a 1 to 14 score. The second half saw Coach Glass'"
men,"guarding closer and consistently breaking up thoir opponents' short pas.ses. At the same time, Searlos got going, ringing two pretty field goals, while Dayhoff also contributed two and Bihl continued his foul shooting,"
making,"all six chances good. Wlls- bach,"
making,"his first appearance at center on the home floor, continued his < xcellent work of the first half, aiding greatly In getting the"
jump,and in retrieving the ball under the baskets.
With,Bihl and Dletrlcli piitting up their usual bang-up
game,"at guard, Albright could cage but three basket.s this half."
As,"a result, the Bucknell quintette nosed their fast opponents out. Albright"
was,by no
means,"an easy team, but rather the contrary, pre- senting a team strong in both defense and offense, as well as possessing speed. Our team, in defeating them, played real basketball and deserved the hard-fnugh victory. For a time it appoared that the Albright fiv' would spoil our record of no defeat on our"
home,floor since 1917.

PICTURE,thusiasm was exhioited by both side^.
The,Phi Pais started their scoring early in the
game,
and,had scored heavily before the S.
A.,E. team got under way. Rooney started their scoring by making a pretty shot from the middle of the floor.
He,scored another pretty shot later with his back to the ba.-iket. throwing the ball over his head. The first half ended with the Phi Psi team in the lead and the score 16-6. Phi
Kappa,Psi had a wonderful playing combination while the S. A. E. s lacked their for-
mer,"great attack and offensive. The Phi Pais had numerous tries for foul goals, due to the roughness on the opposing team's part. Henning played a wonderful"
game,"during the latter part of the second half, scor- ing fl*ld goal after field goal. The"
game,ended victoriously for the Phi
Kappa,"Psi team, the .score being 34-13."
On,Thursday night the Phi Psi team defeated the
Forum,team by the overwhelming score of 41-8. The whole Phi Psi team played nice ball as a unit and their team work from the tap-off was very good.
The,For-
ums,played a hard
game,but were no match for the fast Phi Psi combina- tion. The fir.-^t half ended in an 18-6 score. During the second half the
Forums,succeeded in scoring only 2 poinl.'^. Lapp
and,"Smith went into the game at th-i end of the first half and again In the second half with 8 minutes htill to play. Henning played a wonderful game, and"
Wren,"and Julian also played fast ball. Morrett surprised the crowd by cag- ing three iield goals in succession. Derr and Hopler were put in in place of Julian and DeCoursey,"
who,were taken from the game. The
game,ended with a 41-8 score. DeCoursey and Geheret played a fine
game,for the
Forums,and did most of their scoring. Fry caged 4 out of 8 foul? whle Juian caged 3 out of the same
number,of tries
The,.second
game,of the evening was between tiie Non-Fraternity team and the S. A. E.'.s. The teams were evenly matched and this
made,the
game,"fast and exciting, although at times a little rough."
The,Non-Frats started with a rush
and,scored 7 points before the S. A. E.'s first tally.
They,"then tied the score at 7 points, again at 9 and still again at 10. The first half ended with the S."
A.,"E. team having a slight lead, the score being 12-10. Miller started the sec- ond half by tying the score."
Horan,"and Miller played a fine game, Horan proving liim.-i>lf nni^ of the fastest floor"
men,"ever .""een in the interfrater- nity league. Rooney played a con- sistent"
game,for the S. A. E.'s. The
game,ended with the Non-Fraternity
men,in the lead of a 22-18 score.
Horan,".shot 5 out of 8 foul goals, while Bellac .^faot 4 out of 6 trie.^."
On,Saturday afternoon the Phi Psi team met and defeated the Phi
Gam,team. The Phi
Gams,"did not endan- ger the Phi P3is to a great extent but playing a hard, clean game. The score at the end of the first half wa^ 20-10 with the Phi Psis In the lead"
Numerous,substitutions x^ere
made,in the Phi P.=<1 lineup
and,Lauster
made,his debut on the basketball floor. Henning. Julian and
Wren,did the Phi Psi scoring and Purnell and Beckley did the .^corinE for the Phi Gams. Henning again
was,the indi- vidual star of the game. The final score was 41-23

No,hard and fast set of rubs was proposed.
The,"trend of opinion, however, was that no prep school students, and no"

The,"t'Xt of the eligibility rules will lie included in tlio draft of the by- laws. Following immediately the com- pletion of the track a.ssociation meet- ing the basketball league was organ- ized. All the colleges participated in tlu^ organization of this as.socia- tion save Dickinson and Gettysburg. Th. y both stated that, while thov favored such an association, they had not been authorized to become meni- ber,< of a collegiate body. H. A. Ben- fcr, director of athletics at Albright collese, a graduate of that institu- tion and one of the most wonderful all-aiMiind athletes of his day. was elected president of the Central Penn- sylvania Collegiate Basketball League which is the official title of the"
new,"body. C. G, Aikens, of Susquehanna univer.sity, was elected vice-president and F. Affenbach. of Muhlenburg, was"
named,secretary-treasurer. The
new,basketball league decided to limit its membership to eight
mem-,"bers. The six which participated in the organization are Lebanon Val- ley, Muhlenburg. Juniata, Albright, Bucknell and Susquehanna. The .sec- retary waa instructed to communi- cate with Dickinson and Gettysburg formally inviting them to enter as the seventh"

WEDNESDAY,Last week no meeting of the Buck- nell

Whitcomb,"Riley, this coming Wedne.sday, rath- er than last Wednesday. This should prove an Interesting and valuable meeting and it is hoped that a good- sized crowd will turn out to help thi.s worthy organization start the"

LEWISBUEO,
PENNSYLVANLI,During the past week eight
games,of basketball were played In the Tu<<- tln gyninaHium
among,the different ' fraternities to further decide the po.s- session of the cup to be given to the winning team of the Inter-fraternity league.
The,"Phi Psls with Ave gamen still to play, maintain a clean slate. *"
They,have defeated hIx teams and are malting a strong bid for the ' championship.
The,Non-Frats and
Lambda,Chls rank next with four victorieH and only one defeat. The defeat of the
Lambda,Chis
came,at the hands of the Non-Frats so the
game,between the Phi Psls and thi.s team will in all probability decide
who,shall get the bacon. '
The,llrat
game,of
Moday,night wa^ between the
Lambda,Chi team and that from the Delta
Sigma,houne. the latter appearing on the floor with
new,uniforraH.
The,teams were well matched and at the beginning of the
game,very little scorinK was done. Six minutes of Bcoreless play had passed before Aleshouckas began the scoring with a field goal. Walker followed this by scoring for the
Dem-,"ies, and for the remainder of the half the score"
was,"a tie until just before the blowing of the whistle for the end of the half,"
when,the
Lambda,"Chis forged ahead by one goal, end- ing the period with a 7-5 score. The"
Lambda,Chis further increased their lead early in the second half. Ai? the
game,proceeded the playing be-
came,rough and the refereeing by Doc. Gerhavt was not close. The
game,ended with a 16-10 victory for the
Lambda,Chi Alpha team. Walker and Ross
dd,the scoring for the Delta
Sigma,"team but Tingley assisted greatly with his floor work. Cald- well, Aleshouckas and Larson did the scoring for the victors. ""Ales"" caged 4 out of 8 tries for foul goals, while"
Walker,succeeded In getting ' out of six.
The,second
game,
was,between the two
new,fretornities at Bucknell-- Bet*
Kappa,Psi and Phi Theta Sigma. The
game,was slow
and,lacking in excitement and fouls were quite frc- fiuent.
The,Hrst half ended with a 9-3 score In favor of the Beta Psi team.
The,second half was started by Jolly scoring a tleld goal. Ileir- onimus played the best
game,for Phi Theta Sigma.
The,Beta Psi's pre- sented a well-balanced team and all played a good
game,
Long,and the two Mus.slna boy.s plaj-ing especially well. The
game,ended with the Beta Kap- pa Psis the victors of a 24-8 score.
The,last game of the evening was a postponed
game,between the
Kappa,
Sigma,team and that of the Forums. Mohler opened the scoring and De Coursey followed by .scoring a pretty one from under the trapeze. Tho
game,was fast as the teams were well matched. The
Kappa,Sigma team lacked ability to work the ball up under the basket. The
Forum,team played a wonderful
game,
and,did some fine shooting.
The,fir.'^t period ended In a 15-5 score with
Forum,in the lead.
The,second half was hard and rough on the part of the
Kappa,Sigs The
Forums,continued to outplay their rivals
who,were still unable to work the ball up the floor but shot from a distance. The Kap- pa Sigs improved the score near th-' last
when,"they had a slight edge, al- though the"
Forums,were never in danger as the score
wa<<,not close. Every
man,on the
Forum,team played a high cla.ss game. The
game,* nded in a
Forum,victory to the tunc (f 24-5. Mohler did most of the
Kappa,"Sig scoring, while Davis. De Counsey and Wolfe held up that end for the"
Forum,tenia. Fiy caged S out of 12 tries at foul.'>> while Mohler only found 1 out of 5.
On,Wednesday evening three more games were played.
The,first was a victory for the Non-Frats against tho
Forum,team. Dtltrick acted as ref- eree in the absence of Doc. Gerhart. Ed.
Mahoney,
made,"the first score of the evening, and followed with an- other from the tap-off. Oehret"

B-,"Bucknell lost its hardest fought , Thi.s five minutf s .saw some heari-"
A,very large
number,of alumnae of Bucknell Institute and University convened at the
Women's,"college on Tuesday evening, February 8th,, l\i celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the"
Alumnae,Club of Lewisburg. The meeting was opened with a piano solo by
Mary,Reed '21. It
was,altogether fitting that Pres- ident Emeritus John
Howard,Harris should be present to address the club.
The,theme of Dr. Harris' ad- dress
WEB,the progress of Bucknell since he entered it in 1865. at which time Justin
R,Loomls was president of the University. After graduation. Dr. Harris
went,to Keystone Acad-
emy,
and,"upon completion of twenty years' service there, he returned to Bucknell."
A,"principle which he tried to instill into the institution was the principle of progress. ""There is nothing in the world which tan't bo made better and which ought not to be"
made,"better."" Dr. Harris was in- strumental In getting the Board of Trustees to pass a resolution that every year there s^hould be some ad- vance. Speaking of football, tho team of 1893 which defeated Cornell. State"
and,"Lafayette, wa.s declared the best. Everyone"
was,enthused by Dr. Har- ris' declaration that
we,ought to make Bucknell's
Women's,College the Bryn
Mawr,"of central Pennsyl- vania, but he pointed out the fact that It cannot be done on a throe acre lot."
A,hundred acre.s would not be too much. Dr. Harris
was,liivisli In his praise of the School of Music and said that there
was,"nothinj; thsit contributed more to the spiril, ad vancement and good-will of the Uni- versity than the School of Musi"" The opportunities to l.ear concerts brought here by the School of Music were many. ""If I had enough money,"" said Dr. Harris. ""I would first put It into the"
endowment,"of the School of Music and secondly Into a buildins for the School of Music' Following Dr. Harris' addre.ss, u trio composed of Mrs. Moyer, Miss Pines and .Mrs. Blair, sang"
"""Wako","Miss Lindy."" All former presidents and founders of the club then formed a recelvins line, after which refreshments wero served."
game,"of the season at Gettysburg on j Saturday night in an extra period of five mniutes, by a score of 29-28. :"
With,"the calibre of ball played by | the Orange and Blue on the small Oetty.<burg floor,"
a,"victory. Instead of a defeat, was deserved. Those"
who,witnessed the Bucknell-Gettys- burg
game,"on our floor, the score of which was 31 to 30 in our favor, would have witnessed an even greater battle had they seen this game."
From,"the beginning, it could be seen that both teams were going at their best, and that the"
game,"would be a olo-;e one. Such a defeat can well be con- sidered a victory, for the Gettysburg ccHch himself"
made,"the remark before the game tliat if Gettysburg did not defeat a team by five points on that floor, it was practically a defeat. Because each team defeated th) other on Its"
own,"floor by one point, the Bucknell"
management,challenged Gettysburg to a third
game,"to be played on a neutral floor. Gettysburg has not yet answered tho challenge. The first half ended with the score 12 to 9 in Gettysburg's favor. Both teams were fighting hard, but tho Orange and Blue had not yet become accustomed to the floor, the forwards being unable to locate the basket."
Our,"points this half were as a result of a field goal and 5 fouls by Bihl and a field goal by Dayhoff. Gettysburg started the .second half with two field goals and a foul. Thr? Bucknell tossers located the basket and made a spurt, scoring four field goals, tying it up at 17."
From,"then on, until the last minute of the half things were nip and t\ick. With thirty seconds to go and Gettysburg ahead. 26 to 24, ""Vic"" Bihl dribbled up the floor and .shot the basket, tyin^i the score."
A,second later the whistle for tho end of the
game,"blew. It was then necessary to play a flve- minute etxra period breaking, hair-raising basketball. Bucknell .scored first"
when,"Dietrich rung one in from the side. Over a minute passed, with no other score both teams mlslng shots at the bas- ket."
A,"foul was called on Bucknell which the Gettysburg foul .shooter made, leaving the Orange and Blue one point in the lead. After the next tOKS-up, (itttysburg worked the ball under the basket and scored. But a minute and a half was loft for play in which lime Bucknell had ihrt>o shots roll around the basket, but fall to drop through. With the ball in Bucknell s possession under the bas- ket, the whistle blew. The line-up;"

He,"has announced the above date of departure from Lewisburg. which dale, Incidentally, is the same upon which the spring recess commences, and has alHO"
named,four towns with wliich contracts have been signed. Three of the.se towns are in
New,"Jer- sey, and are Vineland, Bridgeton and North Plainlleld. The fourth town l.^ In this state, and Is"
West,"Chestre. These places were visited last year, at whihc tlnic the club"
made,"a favor- able impresi^ion upon the people, and the people upon the club, so that the"
men,Itwk forward to the time which they will spend there. Just
how,"long the trip will take Is not decided as yet. as no decision can be reached until the matter of engagements is settled. However, the"
men,"are assured of a trip lasting at least eight or ten days, and per- naps longer. Whether or not dates for"
New,York. Philadelphia and Washington can be .secured remains to be senc. but the manager is striv- ing hard to get them. Inasmuch as the Easter trip is con- sidered
among,the
men,"to be the most pleasant of all. in addition to being superior to the others in more than one way, there Is considerable inter- est being"
shown,in the preparation^^ for it.
Some,new numbers are being worked up. which fact adds still more interest.
A,week-end trip for April 28 and 29 has been settled by the manager.
On,"Thursday night, which is the twenty-eighth, the club will sing at Pottstown. and on the following ev- ening, at Reading. The good"
work,of the club
when,it -sang at these towns last year
made,the signing of the contracts for this year easy. At the meeting of the club last
Monday,evening .several announce- ments of interest were made.
The,"first of these was that intensive re- hearsal for the remainder of the time before March 23 will be held. Thl.^ means that at least one rehearsal will be held each week, on"

CONCLAVE,
HERE,
The,annual conclave of the fifth diHtrict of the
Kuppa,Sigii'a frater- nity was held over the past week-end at the house of the Alpha Phi chap- ter at Bucknell.
The,"program in- cluded a dance in the club on Friday evening, a buKiness meeting on Sat- urday and a smoker In the fraternity"
home,"on Saturday night. The fra- ternity was quite honored to liave a<< one of its delegates and gue.st.s, hYank J. Shea, the greatest quarter-mller in the United States."
He,is inter- colleigate champion and was a
mem-,ber of the Olympic team that com- peted last
summer,in Belgium.
He,was the delegate from the University of rittsburgh.
The,other delegates were J. Harold Strickler and William
W.,Shultz from State College; Donald R. ilart and John Q. Robin^^on from Washington and .leffer.son; Roland R.
Lehman,"from Dickinson; and Jo- .<eph R. Carder, William S. I'rice and John Kennedy from the University of West Virginia. At the dance on Friday night Diffy's College Five furnished their usual brand of syncopation to the dancing couples. 11 was a wonderful dance and thoroughly enjoyed by all."
Among,the guests were ^Ir. and .Mrs C. A. Lindenian. Mr. and Mrs.
W.,
A.,Blair. Mr. and Mrs. Neal Baker. Mr. and Mr.s. B.
W.,GvilTitli. and Judge and Mrs. A.
W.,Johnson.
On,"Saturday the busine.ss ifieeting of the Conclave began at 10 o'clock and lasted through until 4 o'clock, with the exception of a .short period that was taken off for dinner. The vi.-iiors were then taken to the movies and after the evening meal a smoker was given in the house."
A,spirit of brqthcrly friendship
was,everywhere in evidence which
made,the smoker one not soon to be forgotten. If wa.s a great conclave and one that Alpha Phi is proud of.

The old-time ""hike"" Is being sripplanted more and more by some artificial means of lo- comotion. Baseball. Itself, which used to exercise the muscles of its great numbers of enthusiasts,"

community,in providing Its
own,facil- ities.
And,right in this distinction is the real value of the work. Conimun Ity Service Is not something superlm posed upon a community. It Is a structure built by the
community,Itself.
What,a city
manager,"Is to the civic life of a community, the com- munity service director is to the lei- sure time life of a conmiunlty. He, or she), Is a consultant"
and,an ad- visor.
He,has an opportunity to give consclsene.ss and direction to
what,might be otherwise fumbling and tentative moves of conmiunlty
mem-,bers
who,would bring to bear upon their
work,more of enthusiasm than of experience. The director's Interests cover the entire field of community recreation. His Imagination Is confronted with no less a task than helping his muUi- mooded constituency to evolve a sat isfactory leisure time program. .\R'l he

many,tem- poraments and with diversified chan- nels of Interest.

Hm,o.ecedented report Did Bucknell gain or did Bucknell lose by their 31-30 victory over Oet- ty.sburg In Lewlsburg
on,Saturday night? As far as the casual newspaer reader is concerned the contest was merely an ordinary one-point victory of one rival quintet over another. But to the veteraif Gettysburg sport followers it carries with it a vast signiflcance. For twenty years Bucknell has been a leading rival of Gettysburg.
Even,"before the days of the historic battles on Island park in Ilarrisburg, the two rivals met flrst in Lewlsburg, then in Gettysburg. Always the rela. tlous between the two, although at"
Umes,"bitter In their rivalry, were al- ways fair. The better team nearly always won. Getysbiirg admits fair- ly that the Bucknell elevens led by the agile Tip Tophaiii, the great end Jordan, and others of more recent years have always played superior ball to the boys frora the battlefield. The cry"
"""we",got a
raw,"deal"" is as old as sport Itself."
From,"a constant cryer It atracts no attention. Tills situation, however, is differ- ent. For the past six years no Get- tysburg basketball team has ever re- turned here in defeat or victory with the alibi of receiving poor treatment."
Monday,"morning, however, the hone-t opinion of the"
men,"was that they had lost to Bucknell because in the last few minutes of play Kefcree Earnest, a young"
man,"from Williams- port,"
who,"was not a Central Board official such as is provided for visit- ing teams in Getty.sburg, persisted in calliur: fouls until nneknell tallied the neces-sary point to win. i Such treatment as"
was,"afforded Gettysburg at Lewlsburg topples Bucknell from tlie high pedestal i where she once stood in the minds | of all Gettysburg pportsnuu and places her. in a class with Carlisle High School where Gettysburg schol- astic teams perpetually receive poor treatment. All of which leads to tho question, is it better to win in point of score or in point of sportsmanship? ."

WedneBday,ev- ening with one of the closest guard- ing
games,"of the season. It was fast and rough throughout, both teams being very"
much,In evidence in the ferocious tactics. Aleshouckas start- ed the scoring by tossing a foul after about four minutes of hard basket- ball. It was then clearly evident that the score would be low as neither team seemed able to
work,the ball under the basket for a shot. The first half ended with the score 6-4 in favor of the S. A. E.s.
When,"hos- tilitlee were again resumed, Caldwell, the"
Lambda,"Chi forward, aeemed to have taken on"
new,"life, and by cag- ing three pretty baskets, put his team in the lead and practically decided the game."
He,"was without doubt the t^tar of the game, but due credit must be given the other playerH, as tliey all gave a good account of them- selves. Beliak was the star of the S. A."
E.,team. The
game,"ended 13-11, with the"
Lambda,Chis on the big end. The other
game,"of the evening wa.s between the Phi Psi.s and tho Beta Ivappa Psis. This game, like the nther,"
was,"filled with fast and rough l)asketball to a very great degree, fly- ing tackles being a specialty. The Phi P.sls. without Julian, played their usual scoring game, \s ith"
Wren,"the l)est point getter, having four baskets ill both the first and second half."
He,"was the prize winner of the evening with his close guarding, rapid pass- ing and accurate Rhooting."
M.,]\Ias- sina
was,"the Beta Ivappa Psl Ktar, playing a very hard and consistent game, but the grade"
was,too
much,for his team to make. Thi.s
game,"ended as have all former games ended, with the Phi Psis on the candy end of a *J3-11 score. The C. E."
A.,"girls furnished the entertainment of the evening in the form of eight weirdly dressed young women, so costumed as one of the requirements of their public Initia- tion."
A,big laugh
was,brought forth froni the large audience
when,"liiey marched around the floor singing, and then each one in turn took a shot at the basket, only one of which hit the coveted ring on the Inside. This i afforded the male population of Bucknell their only chance of seting the"

-13,"Caldwell Aleshouckas Larson Claire Carlson Last week's issue of the ""Susque- hanna,"" contained the following clipping, showing"
how,a more friend- ly feeling Is growing between tho Orange and Blue and It down-river rivals.
"""A",
game,of greatest skill was that on the Bucknell fioor last Thursday night.
Tho,"the Orange and Maroon lacked nine points for the victory, does in no"
way,"say they were beaten or outplayed; but filled with burning eagerness to get even In the next con- test, is the essence of It all."
The,"old and bitter rival of the Orange and Maroon, challenging the utmost power and skiii. ambition ami hopes, started the"
game,at a fast ami energetic pace.
The,close calling of fouls and scrimmage together with the good sportsmanship of the stu- dent body
made,the
game,"clean and interesting. Bucknell took the lead In scoring by means of two fouls, but were soon left behind by the rapid scoring of Rogawicz and Leidick."
Thus,during the first half it
was,a question to the spectators
who,"would win, (for thfi close alternating score varied but little."
The,"half ended with the score favoring Bucknell 22-18. After a rest, and sharp criticism by Coach Stahl the second half began."
With,"a lead of four points and the accurate shooting of Searles, Buck- nell was barely able to keep in the lead until the end. The contest"
was,hard fought and every
man,did his utmost. Sharp and quick plays by
means,"of signals were frequent by the ability of Rogawicz at center; his locating of the basket for four goals in the first half adds more to his superior capability, but playing with a badly sprained ankle in the second half, handicapped"
him,"severely. The skillful ffoor work of Leidick. both defensive and offensive,"
was,"exceptional, his caging of fouls is a record seldom seen, which added"
much,to the total score. The close guarding of Sweeley held Dayhoff to two goals. Sweeney and Rayiacr fought hard throughout the
game,and demonstrated fine floor work. The close guarding on the part of Bucknell
made,it difficult on the part of the Orange and
Maroon,to score. Searles* fast working and ability to locate the basket did most of the scoring for Bucknell. Good team work and fast passing
was,"a featur'j throughout the game."""

He,"began by contra- dicting the prevalent idea that mor- ality, or religion, concerns only Sun- day .school children and old people about to die."
He,"drew a very tilting all the necess.tles and even riches of life except society. 'Tis a poor sport, he said,"

He,pictured the old horse-power driven threshing outfit of the early V.'^st in which the feede had to keep a t<<teady stream of sheaves pouring into the cylinder in order to maintain an even speed In the whole outfit. His other

among,thos'j somewhat low on the percentage seal? have proved fa.-it and close. Such were the
game,of the Phi
Gams,
end,"the Delta SIgs,* and the cnnto.st between the"
Kappa,Sigs and the Beta
Kappa,"Psis, played last Thur.sday evening in the gymnasium. The Delta Si^s got"
away,to a run- ning start in the first half and con- tin\ud the lead of three or more poinl.-^ through the entire first half. In the second half the Phi
Gams,"se- cured only one point but the Delta Sigs caged one two-counter and four fouls, finishing with sixteen points to eisht held by the Phi Gams. Foxal was the scorer for the Delta Sigma five and Reed high"
man,for the Phi Gams. The scoend
game,of the evening was the more exciting and the
mem-,bers displayed more concerted attack and united teamwork. Shots from all angles on tho floor frequently dropped through the baskets of both teams. Mohler and
Morgan,for the
Kappa,Sigs and Mu.ssina for tho Beta
Kappa,Psis played their usual active floor games and caged repeat- edly for their teams. The
Forum,team succeeded in win- ning from S.
A.,"E, after a hard strug- gle Saturday afternoon by the scora of 17-14. S."
A.,"E. started the scor- ing, Rooney dropping in a foul bas- ket immediately after the"
game,be- gan. This was followed by a good exhibition of floor play by both team in which Davis succeeded in scorin-; twice and Seybold once. The S.
A.,E.'s were leading 11-8 at half time. The
Forums,"came back strong in the second half. Gehret .scoring twice on loiiL shots from the center of the floor, followed by a nice two-pointer by Davis, which put the"
Forums,in the lead.
A,"Ijasket by Klshbauh clinched the game, the score stand- ing 17-14 ot the final v.hlstle."
The,all-around paying of the

KIPLING,
DAY,
AT,
BUC,
KNELL,
LY,
CEUM,Laat week's meeting of the Buck- nell
Lyceum,was devoted to Rudyard Kipling. The program was quite varied and IntercBting. and tho>>e
who,"gathered in the chapel were well pleased with It. While the audience was not so large sm it Hhould have been, it waa appreciative. Prof. L. L. Rockwell gave a very comprehensive review of Kipling'.^ life, his works, and his present-day reputation Following are some of the high lights from the speech: Rudyard Kipling was born In"
Bom-,"bay, India, in 1865, of very able par- ents. At the age of five he"
was,"sent off to ICngland for his education; and at eighteen returned to the country of his birth with the intention of pur- suing a journalistic career. After a year or two, however, he entered into what"
was,"destined to become hie life work,"
when,his first book
came,out in 1886. Three years later he re- turned to England by
way,"of the United States, from which trip the inipre.'isions of America,"" emerged. In 18U0, his first novel. ""The Light that Fulled."" appeared, it being re- markable because Kipling wrote two diflerenl endings to it. After his marriage to an American, he resided for four years in Vermont."
Then,"he took his trip through the British colonial possessions, his writings con- crening these winning for him the title of the ""Higlit Priest of the Brit- ish Empire. ' Kipling's later work, lujwever, has bi.cn deteriorating and is far from being equal to his earlier writings. The works of his youth have been criticisid as being unfair to women, containing few philo.soph- ical ideals, and being overdrawn. Lawreiu.B Kimball sang"
"""On",". the Iload to Mandulay."" accompanied by ivathryne Wagner, and responded to an encore with ""Banjo Song."" Har- ry F. Koye recited Kipling's ""If."" and was followed by Clara Casner."
who,"gave a parody on ""If."" Emily Uevine recited"
"""Gunga","Din."" All of these numers where well delivered and added"
much,"to the enjoyment of Kipling. The last feature of the afternoon was the giving of ""The Incarceration of .Mulvaney,"" by Prof. G. F. Rass- weiler. The professor's handling of this story almost converted some of his Frosh students In the audience to his standard. For those"
who,"had never read the story, the"
number,"was a delihtgful treat, while for those wliu liad TL-ad it, a"
new,"insight into .some of the parts and a general bet- ter undersUiiifiing of the whole .""pirl' of the story resulted."

CCESS,"Washingtons birthday was a hap- py day for Delta Sigma,"
when,about rtfteen of the
men,raided the
"""Sem""","and took their fair prizes on a lengthy sleigh ride. The objective .was Fore.^t Inn. which was reached about one o'clock, after a three-hour ride."
Two,sleighs were needed to carry the co'iples.
The,asinine (juad- rupeds attached to one of the sleighs caused
much,"trouble to their pas- sengers both coming and going, fore, ing them to dismount and plod up the hills in the cold, deep snow. DLscomforts were forgotten at For- est Inn, however, for there was"
warmth,and food.
The,"lads and las- sies had their fill of chicken and waf- fles and Ice cream, and all the ftixln's. One ""lad"" held the record with twenty waffles downed, in addition to the rest of the stuff. The ride"
home,"was uneventful, that is to say- It was no better and not worse than the going out. Under the careful laanipulation of the chap- erones. Prof, and .Mrs. Harrold, the ""Sem"" was safely reached by seven o'clock."

From,Pueg One scorerK fm the Deiuios while Coe. Miller and llobb kept the >>corer>>>> busy chalking up their baBketg.
On,Tuesday the Demies and For-
umH,"fough out a very cIohc game, tho Ueinles wlnuinK by the Bcore of 2 3 to 21. The"
game,"wa.s hard fouKht all the way, the Kcore flrst being in favor of one team and then the ohter. The"
game,"might have ended in a tie had DeCourHey shot a few Bee- ends earlier, as the ball dropped thru the net Immediately after the whistle blew, but the basket did not count. Foxall, Tingley and Ross played a fine"
game,"for the Demies, while De- Coureey was the leading point scorer for the Forums. On iMonday night the Non-Frats suffered their second defeat in tht' hands of the"
Sigma,Chi qulntete.
The,team work and accurate passing and shooting was too
much,"for the Non- Frat aggration, which was not up to its usual form. Dorris"
made,the In- itial Bcore and later
Mangan,"further added to it. Hall intercepted a pass and shot a ba.sket, thus"
making,the first score for that team.
Townsend,made a field goal and
Horan,"a foul goal, making the score 7-3 In the Sigs favor. But the Non-Frats were not to he left behind, for Treadwell made a pretty basket from the middle of the floor and Coe followed with another one, thus tying the score at 7 points However. Woodring broke the tie with a field goal and"
Mangan,"further increased their lead with two more goals before the end of the first half, which ended in a 14-7 score. In the second half Townsend and Miller .scored two points for thoir respective teams, thus starting the scoring. The Sigs proceed to greatly increase their lead"
and,the
game,soon became spiritless
when,the Non-Frats apparently lost their old-time fight- ing spirit.
The,Non-Frats succeeded in scoring 3 points in the .second half and the
game,ended in a Slg victory with a score of 32 to 10. In the second
game,
Lambda,Chi defeated the
Kappa,Sigmas by a score of 22-20 in a hard and close game. Aleshouckas started the scor- ing with a field goal and Doc
Mohkr,in turn
made,the initial score for
Kappa,Sigma. The
Lambda,Chi team played a fine passing game while the passing of the
Kappa,Sig team wa.-i poor. The score was tied at 4 points The Kappa Slgs obtained
many,trie.s at foul goals but lacked an acurate foul shooter and were not able to tally up
many,one-points.
The,
Lamb-,da Chls went in the lead and then the
Kappa,Slgs advanced to the front rank. The score
was,again tied at 8 points. Dinn
made,a field goal just before the whistle ending the half which nded in a 8-11 score. Caldwell began the scoring in tho .second half with a field goal and the
Lambda,Chis further increased their lead with 3 more field goals while the
Kappa,Sigs were getting one field and one foul goal.
Hahn,"and .\les- houckas were taken, from the"
game,and Arnold and Martin put in in their places. The scoring again be- came close at 20-19 and then Clare
made,the final score by caKing a pretty one from the middle of the floor. Caldwell played a wonderful
game,for the
Lambda,"Chis, as did .Mohler for the"
Kappa,Sigs.
The,S.
A.,E. shooting squad op- ened their guns on the diniin\itive Beta
Kappa,"Psis on Wednesday af- ternoon, but their eyes did not seem to be in good condition and they"
won,"only with a margin of two points after a pitched battle. Bellack was the star of the game, scoring 18 of the S. A. E.'s 24 points."
H.,"Mussina was the best scorer for the Beta Kap- pa's, caging 4 baskets, and with the able assistance of Long with 3 bas- jkets, kept his team in the running. I The first half ended with the S. A. 'E.'s on the small end of a 14-7 score. During the Intermission, Dorey wa.^ switched from guard to forward and Williams went back to guard. Aftei this change the S. A. E.'s Woke up and forged ahead, thus capturing the honor end of a 2 4-22 score."
On,Wednesday night the
Kappa,"Slgs started the evening with an easy victory at the expense of IMii Theta Sigma, 47-7. The"
game,"was , very uninteresting, due to the un- evenly matched teams, but some en- Joyipent"
was,"gleaned from watching ""Doc"" Mohler and"
Hahn,pile up the points. Moliler
was,"the big scorer of the evening, caging 13 field goals."
Hahn,"ran second with seven. The first half ended with the score 19-1. The Theta Sigmas finally located the basket in the second half, but not often enough."
The,second
game,"of the evening, between the Phi"
Gams,
and,the
Non,"Frats,"
was,the most hotly contested of the three. It started off with the Phi
Gams,taking the lead and looked like another deftat for the
Non,"Frats but the boys .soon got their eye on the basket and forged ahead, never tu be again overtaken. Miller was tho star of the"
game,"with 5 ba.skets Credit Is due ""Flatwheel ' Lewis"
who,was substituted for Rabb at the start of the second half.
He,practically
won,the
game,for the
Non,Frats by caging three weird shots from the center of the floor.
Reed,was the star of the Phi
Gams,with his close guarding and rapid passing. The first half ended with the
Non,Frats leading. 20-13.
The,second half wa:^ practically a repititlon of the first with the
Non,Frats again outscorlng their opponents.
The,
game,ended In favor of the
Non,Frats with the score of 33-23.
The,"third game, between the Slg ma. Chis and the"
Forum,
was,an easy victory for the Sigs.
They,had their shooting eyes and every
man,on th'- team contributed something to the score.
The,Sigs seem to have hit their regular stride after two early season defeats.
The,passing of the Slg team was pretty to watch and
Townsend,
made,it worth while by caging 7 baskets. Gehret played a fine
game,"for the Forums, but could not beat the Sigs single-handed. The first half ended with the score stand- ing 19-9. The second half the Sigs increa.sed their lead and the"
game,"ended with the score 36-13, the Sigs taking the bacon, eggs 'n ev'rythiqg. ^"

APPRECUTION,The
management,of the baskotball team wi.shes to take the opportunity here to express its appreciation of aH the kindnesses rendered the team nn its recent trip to Pittsburgh. The alumni organization not only enter talned the team
members,"as its guest- at the banquet, but also stood the ex pense of having the team stay for it. Besides his, they lunched the team Thursday noon, and aided greatly in its successful trip by turning out to all the games and being ever present to render Innumerable favors. It can be truly .said, ""they have a Spirit."""

With,"thP sending of over half of th(c) material to the printer the 1022 * L'AKenda"""
made,"Its flrfit deflnlt. Htep towards completion. In fact, plans for the book are nearly per-"
fy,"ed, only a fev^r minor details re- mrinlng to be settled."
The,"book It- .^elf, while"
much,"the same In outside appearance as its predecessors, will l.p greatly improved in all depart- (nents lu addition to having one or"
two,"new ones. The editor-ln-chlef, Finley Keech, together with hip staff, has put"
much,work on the
new,"*'L.'Agenda"" and prospects are that the work will not have been in vain."
The,"manager,"
Hugh,"Kyttle. has had his difficulties with the labor mar- ket, etc.. and he is by no means through. The book is to be dedicated to Pro- fessor Paul George Stolz, head of the Music School. Prof. Stolz has been with Buckneli University for"
many,"year^, and his untiring efforts In Ita activities, such as the musical organ- izations, are highly deserving of thi.^ recognition."
The,dedication is to be written by
Dean,Phillips. Follow- ing the dedicatory will be a
mem-,orial page for Dr.
Enoch,"Perrine. Eight pages of cameo-plate views are to be included. With but one or two e.Nceptions, these views will be from fresh points of view, and pbotopraphK of the campus thu-t have appeared in ""L' Agenda.s"" in the past will"
nnd,no place.
The,editor has a novel
way,of indicating these views that is too good to spoil by explain- ing beforehand. The faculty section will fbow an- other departure from the old
way,"of doing things. Instead of the shop- worn, stiff photographs which have appeared, snap-shots will be the or- <<r. This section will occupy six pages. The four classes are to be arranged In order of their importance and will have individual photographs placed in pan^-1 form, with seven pictures to a panel, and one panel to a page. Names,"
home,"towns, college organiza- tions, etc.. will appear opposite the pictures."
The,"Junior class, will of course occupy the greatest space and be given the greatest consideration In all matters, as the book is essen- ' tially a production of this class. Of the"
two,"remaining classes the Sopho- mores will have considerable space devoted to them, while the Frosh will get all that is coming to th<>Tn. I"
A,
new,"feature of this ""L"" Agenda"" will be the Music School Department. There will be Individual pictures of the Senior Musicals, while in this de- partment will also be included the Glee Club, the Glrl.s* Glee Club, and ' other organizations of like nature The enrollment of the .school will be included. This step has been taken because of the fact that this depart- ment in the clrriculum is as of vital importance as any other and should be accorded deserved recognition. Fraternities and sororities and College Activities will be fully dealt with. Athletics will have a big de- partment, and will Include the rec- ords of all the seasons, and in addi- tion the records of the Interfrater- nity basketball season."
The,"depart- ment will be headed with a full his- tory of the beginnings of Athletics at Buckneli as written by Prof. Brom- ley Smith. Prof. Smith is fully eap- able of doing proper Justice to an article of this .sort, and he has done"
much,research
work,in Its prepara- tion.
The,"Literary section, as prepared by the capable hands of Miss Nellie will be the beat in"
many,Sherwood Eddy has come and gone.
The,question
now,"Is,"
"""What",are
we,"going to do about It?"" Fifty-one students have expressed a desire to join a Bible-study group. One hun- dred and thtrty-flve have signed for a class in aoclal-lndustrial sctudy. Forty-flve have signed for"
summer,"work in nearby cities, to study tho industrial situation."
A,"meeting is called for 7:30 this evening, in Buckneli Hall, for the formation of these study groups. The work will be discussed and leaders chosen. All"
who,"arc interested, are Invited."

Turn,"to Page 3 Today Coach Glass has isseud a call for candidates for the track squad. This form of athletics, once holding forth in Buckneli in a su- preme place, is again to be taken up with full strength."
No,"other sport ran boast of such a history as track has had, starting in Greece"
many,centuries ago with the ancient Olympics and continuing through time
down,to the modern Olympics.
No,"other sport can boa.st of such a meeting of athletics of the various countries of the world to engage ni International competition such as is held .very four years by the Olympiad committee, including all the greatest and most progressive nations of the earth. I^o other sport can boast of .such individual compelltion. ba.sed entirely upon skill, ability and con- dition. It is the fairest and hardest of them all- the best"
man,"wins. Track and Held competition flour- ished at Buckr.ell years ago and upon track more than any other sport wa.s based the athletic prestige of this Institution in the latter years of the nineeenth century. It continued, al- though not holding such a prominent position, until fhout 1!)12."
when,it again sprung forth with great force and for about four years mighty
Mrong,teams were produced. Dur- ing the period of the war. track was given up. It was revived to some extent last year and this year it is hoped It will resume its former prom- inent place
among,the other forms of athletics at Buckneli. Lot us all get hfhinrt the coach and the aspirant.-^ fur tho team and give them our full support: Let us where it belongs here! All
who,"have ever engaged in this sport, come out and give the coach a chanc^ to see"
what,you can do. All
who,"have never worn the spike .shoe, come out and give the thii.g a chance- there is lots of chance for develop- ment. Track is so varied that, though of no value in one event, you can find some event which hard work will"
make,you proficient in. Let us have a good
number,of
men,out to- morrow and the succeeding days. Practice will be held daily any time after three o'clock that is convenient. The coach will be at the
gym,and all should report to him. Of the ten letter
men,"from last year, eight of them are still in col- lege."
We,"lost Lovejoy,"
who,"entered Cornell, and Lighton."
who,graduated from college. But
we,have a nucleus of eight letter
men,around which to build a team. Haslam.
who,"last year twice broke the Buckneli pole- vault record, can well hold"
down,that event and should again break his
own,"record. Treadwell. a good hurd- ler and high jumper, will again ap- pear in track uniform and"
we,"know- he can be depended upon. Williams, this year's captain, will again be in the narrow ring and he has a mighty heave. Hahn. a quarter-mller and dash man, will l)e on deck and will nuike the cinders fly and"
make,"some- one step to beat him. Davis, a con- sistent tenpoint"
man,"last year, will again be out for the mile and two mile. Dinn, last year's star broad Jumper and a mighty good one. will again leap for honors In this event. Mooro will be out for the quarter and the half-mile. Dayhoff,"
who,"last year broke the low hurdle record which was not, however, recognized, will again compete in the low hurdlej and in the quarter-mile. Besidea these letter"
men,are such good
men,"from last year's squad a.^ Wren. Chapman. Morgan. Ross. Sisserson. Schmidt, and Jone-.

game,might be termed the championship game of the .season and it

THE,
WORLD,
PROBLEM,"Ret inning from a visit to twenty countries in Europe and the Near East in hunger and famine, in war und revolution, Sherwood"
Eddy,asked
"""What",is
wrong,with the world?
What,"does the world need today?"""
He,"enswered the question by saying the world needs bread, the world needs peace, the world needs God. Mr. Eddy spoke of the world's need of bread"
among,"the two hundred millions suffering F:urope, the atro- cities in Armenia, and the famine In China."
He,"spoke of the starvation and hunger in Russia. Poland. Aus- help to put track j trla. Germany, the Near East, and the famine district of China."
He,"en- dorsed the appeal of Herbert Hoover on behalf of the students and starv- ing children of Europe, pointing out that ten dollars saves a student. Speaking of the need of peace, Mr. Eddy told of the strife on three fronts"
--,"national, racial and class strife. The ultimate issue of the"
War,"was between autocracy and dem- ocracy, militarism and freedom, might and right. Now, in the period of reconstruction, the world is strug- see-sa^ neither team was sure of victory until I"

men,fought-- Democracy. Liberty and Righteousness.
We,"are in the midst of one of the great crises of all hla- tory, in a decade of transition, in one of the great migrations of the"
human,"spirit. Great as was the change pro- duced by the French Revolution in France, so great will be the change for Europe and the world after tho present war. Just as the period of Robespierre, the Guillotine and the"
Ked,"Terror discredited France and threw England into reaction, so the present v*^viod of tyranny and the Red Terror in Europe is producing reaction But"

One,"sees the Irresistible onward march of dtnu'ciacy in the world today. Fol lowing the Bourbons of France, the Romanoffs, the Hapsburgs, the Ho- henzollerns-- all the great autocra- cies of Europe."
The,social and In- dustrial problem will be the crucial question before Europe and America in this decade. Mr.
Eddy,showed
how,"Britain if finding a solution for the industrial problem not by revo- lution, but by evolution."
He,showed
how,capital and labor are getting together. In closing. Mr.
Eddy,epoke of tho
CAMPUS,
PROBLEMS,
On,
Wednesday,evening Mr.
Eddy,"spoke in an interesting, vital way of the problems of our"
own,campus.
H^,"del,ned the test of education as Its ability to develop all-round"
manhood,and womanhood.
He,"addressed him- self to the problems of college life, basing his judgments on three fun- damental principles of character. 1. Are you nonest? Honesty in athletics"
means,"clean play for the team, no grand-stand stimts. Hon- esty In social relations means the ex- and pride, the ood a Honesty means the beginning of that life of service you are looking forward to. right now. foul and the"
Lambda,Chls maintained the lead through the first half which ended with the score 14-12. In the second half the Phi F-is took more advantage of their free tos.ses and in so doing were able to carry
away,the honors of the ev- ening and also the honors of the sea.son. The
game,ended with the ..core standing. Phi Psls 22.
Lambda,Chis 20. The
game,resolved itself into a foul-shooting contest in which Julian of the Phi Pols hsld a dO' ided ad- vantage over Aleshoucka^^ J\ilian making 8 out of 11 while Aleshouckas
made,only 6 out of 15. Julian kept the Phi Psis In the running with 4 field goals and prac- tically
won,the
game,by his won- derful shooting. The other
members,of the team deserve
much,credit as they all played hard and no
man,"on the team seemed to have anythin;,' in view except that his team must win. Dinn was the outstanding light on the"
Lambda,Chi ship and really cuuld be termed the star of the evening. With his wonderful floor
work,and good shooting he steered the
Lambda,Chi destroyer through very rough waters and was mainly the reason for their coming through the storm a.i successfully as they did.
The,other players also deserve honorable men- tion; in fact every
man,"on the floor deserves credit, as they all played hard, clean and consistent basket- ball."
The,second game
was,between the Sigs and the Beta
Kappa,Psls but duo to the especially good
game,"played before, it seemed to lag in interest and it really was very listless all the"
way,through.
The,Sigs held the upper hand all the
way,through and at no time did the result seem in doubt but the Bet
as,"played hard, ugainst big odds. The"
game,ended with the score stand- ing 20-13. At this juncture the crowd seemed to realize that Interest was lagging and almost everyone left. Only ono more
game,"was to be played and as It could have no possible bearing on the championship,"
why,wait?
The,third game found the Ivappa Sigs and the
Non,Frats conning to- Thls

Came,"All?"" five demands. God in Just p.s real a:s the invii-.ible personality of a per son. The"
God,revealed by Jesu.i Christ fullllls the five-fold
demand,"of nuin's nature, the"
God,"of wisdtjm li: mind, the"
God,"of love his heart, the"
God,"of power his will, the God of holiness his conscience, and a com- bination of them all his religious na ture. The"
God,"of Jesus Clirlst .sat isfies man's relation to his Maker, to himself, and to his fellow-man. Mr. Eddy closed this address with an appeal to each of his hearers to try a simple experiment, to test this God for three months and watch results."
THE,
PERSONAL,
PROBLEM,
The,address of Thur.sday evening
WHS,a summation of the whole .series The central theme was the penson- ality of Jesus Christ.
He,"was first considered as a factor in world de velopment. Plato taught forty years and Christ three, yet His teachings arc"
now,"foremost In the world. Shakespeare has been translated into thirty languages, Tolstoi into forty. Jesus Chri.st, not an author, has been translated into .seven hundred lan- guages. Jestis was no architect, yet the finest architecture of the world has been reared in His honor."
He,"was no poet, no musician, yet the greatest poetry, the greatest music has been written in His praise. Al- though he had no wife"
He,was th<^ Savior of women; although
He,had no child.
He,was the Savior of child- ren.
How,strong?
He,
was,strong enough to give strength to yoti and me.
How,pure? Pilate found no fault in Him;
He,is able to cleanse the blackest sinner. Even the places
He,touched were sanctified. Wicifed Nazareth is
known,as His home.

Work,on the book is be- ing done by
Myra,"Efflnger and Fin- ley Keech. The drawings are In spirit with the renialnder of the book, novel and fresh, yet with a certain amount of dignity."
The,"price of the books has been set at JS.OO. This price is very mod- erate when the fact that in other schools books of lilce character are sold for eight and nine dollars ia taken into consideration. The book, in view of its completeness, will easily be worth that price."
On,"April 8 and 9 will occur ""L'Agenda"" days,"
when,everybody In the University will be given the opportunity of sub- scrlbln;; to the book. At this time a deposit of |2.00 will be
made,"wltl> the pub.scriptlon, and a receipt will be Is.sued. Then, about the first or second week in May. by which time the finished books are expected to he on hand, a designated time and place will be arranged"
when,the subscrib- ers
may,bring their receipts and the additional $3.00 and receive their copiis. This method of subscription is expt'cted to prove popular.

MIFFLINBURG.,
PA.,"Bucknell's campaign for one and ..ne-half millions of dollars in five years, which was Inaugurated last April In a pageant upon the streets of Lewisburg. is moving on apace as la evidenced In the following real facts and figures."
The,"enlargement of the Chemical Laboratory is visible to ev- eryone, and the steady construction , being carried on by Professor Burpee establishes beyond a doubht that Bucknell's forward"
movement,has really begun.
Much,
money,"has been collected al- ready, more Is promised and yet again several prospects are In view for obtaining more of the million and a half."
The,Board of Directors Is not asleep and the
new,Bucknell Univer- sity catalogue will
show,"a layout, proposed, for the entire acreage re- cently purchased by the University. This will prejsent tentative plans for the athletic field,"
new,"buildings, etc. Dr. Judd, trea.surer of the Institu- tion, has received thus far from alumni friends of the school, $28,288."
From,"the Baptist Education Board he has received ?31,898, or a total of $60,000 in round figures. All this has been done since April. Excitement was current on the"
campus,
when,Professor
Drum,was seen to Invade the largo field beyond the Library Saturday morning with a set of surveying instruments and a force of men.
He,"was, Indeed .be- ginning a bit of the vast"
amount,of preliminary work necessary for Hie construction of a
wing,to the engin- eering building.
The,"field must be leveled and a grade established for the foundations of the structure. It is estimated that $10,000 will be necessary for the grade"
work,alone some
6%,feet of earth must be re-
moved,"all over the site of the build- ing and it is ""problematical conjec- ture as to"
what,"sort of earth, rock or ^iilnd. will be found at such a depth. Stakes are already In position, plans have been"
drawn,up by Cararre and llastinKS of
New,"York, but no work is to be done until everything is certain to the smallest detail. However,"
we,
may,be sure that Buck- nell's
new,era of Increased import- ance as an institution of higher learning has truly started.

LEWISBURG,
PENNSYLVANU,"^01 Chaplain James J. Kane, Rear-Ad- miral. retired: of the"
U.,"S. Navy, a graduate of the Theological depart- ment of the cla.ss of 1S67. died Thiirr,- day."
March,10. at the Philadelphia
Navy,"Yard Hospital, and was buried at Arlington cemetery, Va., Saturday. Chaplain"
Kane,"was 84 years of age. Born In Ottawa. Canada, he entered the United tales- navy as a volunteer seaman In 1861. rose to the"
command,of a gunboat and
saw,"service in sev- eral battles- notably In Mobile bay. under Farragut. In 1865 he entered (he Theological course here and was graduated with the cla-ss of 1867. Later ho pursued the law course In Harvard, graduating in 1870."
He,"was chaplain In the navy until his re- tirement in 1896. with the rank of rear-admiral, retired."
He,resided In Brooklyn for
many,"years, but more recently at Asbury Park."
N.,J.
He,"was a cosmopolitan by travel and sympathy, interested in humanity and In progress, devoted to his friends, and to the cau.se of Christ throughout the world."
He,"was a loyal alumnus of Bucknell. having a daughter a graduate of the Insti- tute, and a grandson a graduate of the College."
To,"promote excellence in public speaking, he established the"
"""Kane",Prize for the best oration on
Com-,
menecment,"Day"""
--,a gold watch. Chaplain
Kane,
was,"a gifted con- versationalist, a prized guest In"
mnny,a circle of distinguished people. His
memory,
was,"stored with Incidents of travel and personal experience, which enlivened conversation and Turn to Page Three Upholding the negative side of the question. ""Resolved, that labor should share in the"
management,"of corporate industry,"" a debating team representing Bucknell lost the two to one decision to three orators from Swarthmore last Friday evening In Bucknell Hall. That Bucknell lo.st once more Is a matter of history to go"
down,"along side of the other two defeats of this year, but as a"
medium,"of getting at the basis of very real problems, the debate"
was,
shown,"to be very effi- cient. Sherwood Eddy brought before the student body some real Issues concerning social labor problems, and the subject under consideration Frl- j day night, being right In line with the thought of the students, was the subject of ninre than a little Interest"
Some,"valual)le facts on eitlier side of the proposition were brought for- ward. The affirmative side of the (jues- tlon was ably introduced by the cap- tain of the Swarthmore team, Allan C. Valentine."
He,declared that rep- resentation in industry
was,"to be compared with r^ presentation in gov- ernment, and that taxation witliou* representation was tyranny. The af- firmative attack as a whole"
was,upon the principle of the fact that the workers were entitled to a voice in management. They pointed out that the existing conditions were far from satisfactory
and,"produced sharing plans, such as is in u.-^e by the Phila- delphia Rapid Transit Company, fo support their contention that to give labor a voice in the"
management,was to solve the problem.
On,"the other hand, the ncj^ativc argued from a legal basis and sliowed according to the law of the cas.-, r- p resentation in"
management,"v/as r.ot legal. They upheld the case of the public, the great body of people"
who,"arc neither capital or labor, and d--"
manded,justice for them. They ar- gued that sharing in
management,"was not feasible, that it"
was,undem- ocratic and that it
was,against Amer- ican initiative . It was perhaps the last speaker of the affirmative
who,
won,"for Swarth- more. He, in a forceful presentation, set over against the legal argument of the negative the"
human,"side of the case, and"
wound,up the plea for his side In an appeal to the rights of la- bor against capitalism. The program was as follows: Prof.
Amos,"Lee Herold, presiding officer. Affirmative. Swarthmore: Allan C. Valentine, captain, William"
M.,"Blaisdell, Herbert L. Hutchinson. Negative, Bucknell: Flnley Keech, Captain, William Herbert Sugden. Laurence"
M.,"Kimball. Judges: Mr. Roger North. Selinsgrove, Pa.; Prof. Herbert Allen Allison. Selinsgrove, Pa.; Mr, Walter Wilson, Milton, Pa. Jones-Hausauer Co.. Buffalo, the printers of the book this year, and with them the board begins to see some material gain and results from their long endeavors throughout the year. If the rest of the book can be judged from these first proof sheets, it bids fair to surpass anything In the L' Agenda line that has appeared at Bucknell In recent years."
The,"ma- terial for the book Is being forward- ed to the printers as fast as it can be gathered together by the board, and I put into .-!hape on the copy sheets. It is expected that all the material"
win,"be gathered and placed In the book before April 1st, which will likely"
make,"it possible for the bool?:i to be delivered the first week in May. Taking into consideration past ex- perinece in the L'Agenda work, and the changing conditions this year."
Manager,Kyttle has devised a
new,"plan for the selling of the book. All efforts are to be conctMitrated, and two days set aside for the particular work of ordering tlxi college annual by the Ktudentn. The.se two days designated are Ap- ril 8th and 9th, the week following our return fro mthe Easter recess. They will be"
known,"as ""L'Agenda Days"" and the business staff of the be coveiKi with information con- cerning the days, and gentle remind- ers that tlie drive is on to"
make,this year's L'Agenda the most read book in colleg< for days to come.
When,"the L'An^nda Is ordered, a deposit of $2.00 will be asked and a receipt giv- en. Then"
when,"the books arrive, the receipt and an additional $3. 00 will entitle tliose"
who,"ordered their book In advance to their copy. Following the L'Agenda Days the final order for the number of books will be forward- ed to the printers, it being only a lim- ited number of copies beyond the !"
number,"ordered by the student body. The same plan has been announced heretofore In this one regard, but M>>nagt-r Kyttle says he means busi- ness this year, and that if any of the students are unable to secure their books after the ; peclai ordering days are over, they will have themselves to thanl< for their negligence, and ask to borrow a copy from another more fortunate."
Remember,the
days--,April 8th and
9th--,"and touch ""dad"" for the extra ""two-M)ot"" while you are"
home,"for your vacation. It is going to be worth twice the price in future yeari in recalling reminiscences of your college years, and the price of the book will then appear inslgniflcant"

member,"of the fac- ulty beginning with September, 1921."
He,is to be connected with the
Chem-,"Istry departfnent. Prof. Groner is, at present, profes- sor of Chemistry at Transylvania University, Lexington, Ky. PrevUms to his professorship at Transylvania, Prof. Groner taught at Ottawa Uni- versity. The Board of Trustees voted an additional professor for the De- partment of Economics, but the ai>- polntment has not as yet been made."
B-,"Nelson Ronnsley, '21, was called"
home,"because of the death of his sis- ter. the outstanding players, the team was picked. After the team had been finally selected, only two games were lo.st. both of them being played on foreign floors with teams of the very highest calibre. Only four garner were lost during the entire season, and these were all"
away,from home.
On,"the other hand, Pittsburgh. Juniata, Gettysburg, Franklin and Marshall, Dickinson, Susquehanna and other teams fell before the ex- cellent passing and shooting of the Orange and Blue."
Much,"credit goes to the team and the fine record It has left behind. It must be remem- bered, also, that Bucknell loses no"
men,"this year through graduation, so that the same combination will be on hand next year to take up the"
game,"where they left off this year. It is hoped that a good schedule will be worked out, so that the Orange and Blue \viil pile up further honors In this collegiate sport."

CATALOG,The Alumni Quin(iuennial catalog for 1920 Is
now,"on press and is ex- pected to be ready for distribution about the end of April. This catalog will contain a wealth of Information. All trustees, presidents, faculty, graduates and matriculates are listed on Its pages. Graduates and matrlc- iilates of college, Institute and music department are arranged according to classes, alphabetically and geo- graphically. There are pool games, and then again there are pool games, and thos * two or more contests which are being staged weekly on Stahl's 'lontr green,"" are developing more and more interest."
A,cup for the win- ning fraternity and a prize from Stahl himself to the winning player* are the stakes for which these ten- o'clock contests have taken on a
new,note of importance. During the past
week,"the Kappa Sigmas surprised the league by de- feating the leaders of the tourna- ment, the"
Lambda,"Chls. In a close contest, full of fine runs. The score was 100 to 98. Then the Phi Psls"
won,from the S. A. E.'s by twenty points and fixed the present stand- ing of the teams as follows:

It wa.^ Charles Kenyon's ""Kindling,"" of which the following description a.-* given on the program, says: "" Kind ling' "" Is admirable as a work of art; but it is even more important as a social document. It Is a sincere and sympathetic study of the emotions of the desperate poor."
The,play reminds us with a pang that each of us is at j least a tacit partner In a social or- ganization that is guilty of Infanti- cide upon an enormous scale. After
we,"have lived the life of Maggie .*^chult:'. for an evening in the theater or library,"
we,can scarcely recede to our
own,"more snug and comfort- able lives without asking ourselves a few serious questions."" The cast is to be congratulated upon the excellent work which they did throughout the entire action of the production and upon the sympa- thetic interpn tations they gave to the play. Every"

A,cloB(c) correspondence between good scholarship In collcKe and em- inence in engineering is shown in an investigation
made,under the aus- pices of the American Association of Collefflate RegiBtrars by Prof. Ray-
mond,"Walters of Lehigh University,"
who,"presents a report in the current i.ssue of ""School and Society."" It was found that, of 392 distin- guished engineers graduated at 7r> technical schools, colleges and uni. versitles, 182 or 46.4 per cent stood in the. highest fifth of their class scholastically upon graduation: 109. or 27.8 per cent stood in the second highest fifth: 72 or 18.3 per cent In the middle fifth: 14 or 3.6 per cent in the next lowest fifth, and 15 or 3.8 per c(?nt in the lowe.st fifth. Figures for a group of 189 alumni of five Eoi^tern engineering Kchool.s were"
somewhat,"different in the upper classes, the second highest scholastic fifth having the larRCst percentage. In all groupings of the eminent en- gineers, there were less than 4 per cent in each of the two lowest schol- astic fifths. Of 730 names on the Registrar's Association list of distinguished en- gineers, practically 80 per cent were found to be collegiate graduates, 16 ! per cent"
men,"of secondary school ed- ucation and practical training, and less than 5 per cent"
men,
who,t;taiteil in college but did not finish.
The,"arbitrary basis of eminence in thi.s study of a professional group was taken to be the holding of office, membership in important committee.^ and service as representatives of the four ""founder"" engineering societies, civil, mechanical, electrical, and min- ing and metallurgy, for five years. 1915-1919. Carl Gelger, '15. and Clinion Sprout, '17,"
members,"of the faculty at Peddle Institute, were the guests of their Delta igma brothers over the week-end."
Thomas,".1. . Helm, ""20, and Hayes J. Person. ""20."
members,"of the fac- ulty of the Willlamsport high school, visited their Delta Sigma brothera over the week-end. ("

"""Y""","could keep a list of place.? where employment might be obtained and students could then simply file their names with them. This would be real service, also. Dr. Hunt em- phasized the fact that the ""Y"" was the one college orgranlzation where the studednts could get together on a"
common,"basLs. Cards were pa.ssed out to be signed in support of the ""Y."" Then there"
was,an open di.s- enssinn on what organization could do.
what,service they could perform at Bucknell. Separation from the budget was brought up and disctis.sed.
A,meet- ing of the cabinet Is to be held and it is to act as a nominating commit- tee to nominate officers to be elected after our return from Easter vaca- tion. These new officers will be sent to

My,
own,experience and observation lead
me,to believe that the present tendencies are to- ward too great specialization or be- ginning specialization upon Insuffi- cient foundations. There Is too
much,anxiety upon the part of our youth ! to pick special courses of supposed Immediate application to the busi- ness of earning money.
We,do not
commence,"building our houses with the purcha.se of a lightning rod and the plumbing and hardware trim. The foundation Is not only of first but of fundamental importance; if it Isn't right, the plaster will crack, the doors will stick, and the roof will leak. For a good job, build upon a rock. Whatever rank or reputation I have attained Is not based upon any great business acumen, selling ability or managerial talent, but upon soun<l technical training ba.sed upon the lib- eral education received at Washing- ton and Jefferson. I believe implicit- provoked and satisfied the Interest ly in the liberal college education as of old and young."

own,"pages the grealesl novela, the greatest short stories, the greatest essays, the greatest philo- sophy and the greatest beauty of thought that were ever combined in any language"
--,"greater than all other books In the world."" The principles of life and conduct In It are a part of the education de- sired in big business. Education for busln'is.s should develop the power of reasorlng, of Intense concentration and of stralghtllne thinking."
The,"mind of the student should be filled with a knowledge of usuable princi- ples of conduct, science, economics and civics, and not with a heterogen- eous collection of facts. There Is .something wrong with the education received at a Christian college which turns out unchristian and antl-chrls- tlan faddists, dreamers and socialists, socialism Is the science of selfish- ness; the falalcy of failure. Educa- tion should Instill in the mind a pas- sion for service, for constructive ef- fort. Desire to serve Is a more noble trait than a desire to get. Financial returns should be viewed as the re- turn that .society makes for well-di- rected creative effort, and not some- thing that the recipient takes from the less fortunate. Earning"
money,is not a crime; making
money,some- times Is.
Some,people
make,"money, but never acquire a fortune. Other qualities than those which reault in earning must be cultivated. The dis- tinction between hoarding and sav- ing and the prolitable use of savings or capital, Is Important for the young"
man,"to know. Opportunity has to be look<<4 for and even created. Prob- ably no one here inherited the major part of his capital or his job. The laborer nf today is the capitalist of tomorrow. As Prof. J. Lawrenae Laughlln says: *'The creation and legitimate possession of capital re- quire certain personal qualities willingness and Imagination to weigh the future gain over against a pres- ent indulgence, self-control, patience persistence, foref-ight and prudence. Those"
who,possess these homely vir- tues become possessors of capital and hence employers of others; those
who,have them not and
own,no capital must seek those
who,have capital and hence are employed by others. The separation into two great classes of the employers and the employed ^ due to differences In
human,"qual- itie.s; differences, however, of a kind which can be remoTCd t)T training, environment, and the development, of character and civilization."" Thi.* ^-reat distinetion between those"
who,acquire and those
who,do not should be realized by every educated man.

Amy,Gilbert (AlllBon.) Jessie Steiner (Hursh).
Mary,
Wood,"(Kerstetter), and Ida List as charter members. Three of these"
women,"gra- duated two days after initiation, and y*he others did not return to finish their coursep, At this same time, a raculty ruling reguiring Sophmorc pledging wa.s pa.=sed. As the result <;f these difficulties, Eta became In- active June 1899, and the charter was withdrawn in 1904. In 1920 the National Council of Alpha Chi"
Omega,wrote to the college authorities asking if a suitable group (ould be found to undertake the re- establishment of Eta Chapter. The ten girls
who,were chot^en were con- sidered favorably by the National Inspector
who,visited the college in May.
No,"further steps were taken until October 1920,"
when,permission to petition for a charter
came,"from the extension board. -Mrs. Irving Brown, the Atlantic province presi- dent, came In"
November,to organize the group as Zeta Nu.
The,"formal petition was sent in January, and a charter was granted February 11, 1921."
The,"week-end of April 1 and April 2, was devoted to the re-estab- Ushment of Eta Chapter of Alpha Chi Omega."
The,jn.slalling officers were: Mrs. S.
D.,"Graff, Grand President, Mrs. Irving Brown, Atlantic Province President, Mrs. Ethel Moore Miller, Miss JosepWne Lee Meek, Miss Ruth Titue. Miss"
Edna,Fulton and Miis
Ruth,"Lassen. Mrs. Allifon and Mrs. Kerstetter, original charter membere. of Eta Chapter also were guests of the fraternity."
A,"formal reception to representatives o fthe faculty and of fraternities and sororities was held from 3 to 5 o'clock Saturday after- noon, April 2, in the"
Women's,College parlors. In the evening a banquet was served at
Hopp,"Inn, .Mifflinburg. Alpha Chi"
Omega,"was founded Oct. 15, 1885 at"
Depauw,"University, Greencastle. Ind. a.': a musical frater- nity. In 1908, at a national conven- tion, the constitution was amended, making Alpha Chi"

Gamma,"Delta enjoyed the beit house party since Us establishment Jit Bucknell. during the recent Easter vacation. The party sftarted at noon on Wednesday, March 23, and closed Saurday afternoon, giving those pres- ent a chance to get to their homes in time to enjoy Easter day."
Much,"of the success of the house party wao due to Waring's Banjo orchestra and the music they furnished, which, a' usual, was of the very highest grade. Dances were held Wednesday anJ Tbur.<<day evenings at the chapte- house from eight to one, and Friday Tiight at the Lewisburg"
dub,"from nine to five, with a breakfast served afterward at the house. At inte-- mlsslon on Friday night, a four- course supper was served, during v/hich time the orchestra gave sev- eral of its specialties. .Many of the Phi"
Gams,"imported girls from out of town and from othf'r school,"" Cornell. Columbia. Beech-"

Prom,"of Buck r.ell Univcr-sity will be held on Fr:- aay. April 29. at the Lewisburg club. In other years this affair ha:- ueen the crowning social event of the eea- son, and il the efforts of the class of 1922 are any standard by which to judge, thiH >ii.i .*< i'M>iii y,A In 1 . . ble lo attain the esteemed height* of its predecessors. The newest, and probably the mo.'^i 1)1. asing feature of the coming F:c>ni, will be the presence of college women. Hitherto, the college i^irl'^ were not allowed lo attend the Prom, but this year President"
Hunt,has been kind enough to allow the j-'rl-^ lo participate with the college iiien.
The,Lewisburg club has been chosen as the place for
Prom,becaus- of the condition of the floor. There is no doubt that the Lewisburg
dub,"has the best floor for dancing a:.d also the best accommodations fo* the guests of any of the places ih.M could be selected. In order to insure ample dancing space for those at- tending, the sale of tickets will ab- solutely be limited. As is the custom, the"
Prom,"will be strictly formal. Now, right here is ""the"" opportunity for the ""fussle-' to give their"
"""Sem""",girls a treav Just bear in
mind,that this is the only formal dance of the season at Bucknell and you will be able to be in delightful association with your girl from 7:30 to
12--,so just put that date
down,as one you car- not afford to miss.
The,"committee In charge ha.""- l""EURn working very earnestly to"
make,thi- Jtinior
Prom,the equal of any that has been held yet and all arrange- ments are about completed. Let's see the students turn out r.nd support the Junior cla.'-s in endeavor- ing to

Prom,jvi.t
what,It should be. Tickets
may,"b;- had from the committee at the dif- ferent fraternity house.^. Don't fo-- get, as soon as the limited"
number,"is sold, there are no more . Good base running and timely hit- ting enabled Eddie Plank's Gettys burg nine to slip a surprise to Buck- nell"
when,the Orange and Blue
men,covered the
home,diamond for the first
game,of the season last Thurs- day.
The,score was 6-1. Things looked bright for Bucknell during the first part of the
game,
when,"Jones ran the circuit from first \inder the protection of Captain Linker's three-base hit, deep to cen- ter field. In fact, Gettysburg carried a goose egg In the run column until the 5lh. At that time Julian'.^ passed ball permitted Schulls to come"
home,from first.
The,"visitors carried the impetus of this success over Into the next period,"
when,a clean hit by Gingerlch and a walk given Redcy allowed those
men,to tally for Gettys- burg as Kelser took a two base hit and Hersh a three base hit from Bellak. It was the old story of the hoodoo 6th. The score book looks pretty bare in any place except the 5th. 6th and 7th times up for Gettysburg. The visiting nine was not able to place the skids under Cockill's crew until the 6th. In the first periods tho Bucknell
men,"took the measure of the slower Gettysburg nine and counted one run, a three base hit, a clean single, and a pretty steal by Jones. While they were doing this Getty^^burg, slow In getting started, piffed the pill for three hits and that was about all. In the 7th Gingerich clouted into deep center and circled the gravel for Gettysburg's fifth run, pushing Kyle before him across the pan. That was the last scoring they accomplished, demanding only two questionable -ingles from Bellack in the next per- iods. Pitching his first"
game,"for Bucknell, Bellack looked good on th'.- mound, handling himself and the"
new,"sphere like a veteran. The bits he drew did not show his perform- ance. All things considered, the Orange and Blue nine worked fairly good. Better ba.'^e running and more careful connection with the pill ought to see Bucknells' ability to win from Delaware this Wednesday. 1 The lineup: Bucknell r. h. o. Jonee, cf"

men,"leaving Lewisburg early on the morning of March 28, form- ed the beginning o fa splendid, tho short, trip o fthe Bucknell Glee Club. These"
men,gradually accumulated more and more on the
way,"to tho first stop in Pitman,"
N.,"J., until"
when,that point was reached all of the twenty-five
men,
who,were tu
make,"the trip were gathered together. At Pitman the first successful con- cert of the trip was given, and al- though there was no dance after the concert, the"
men,"were entertained royally at their ovemirht homes. ThI.s concert was the first of a string of the most succeFi:ful con- certs the club has ever put on. In every instance the members putting their best into their work. The club was at its best with its collection of numbers of varying se^r- iousncss; and manager Hartz filled the office of director very acceptably in the absence of Prof. Paul Stolz The quartette had a revised series of songs and the duet by Willman and Rounsley, although of grand opera, was well received. Keech'a cartooning again proved itself the best of the light numbers on the pro- gram. Robert Hartz played his vio- lin to perfection and the vbcal solo- ists"
--,Donald Cloward and
Homer,"Eaton, were at their best."
One,"of the big hits of the trip was the saxo- phone soloist, J."
H.,"Melhuish. This was ""Mel's"" first appearance with the club and his work, both classical and jazz, took wonderfully."
He,"was ably accompanied by Fred Moore at the piano. The second concert w{.s given in Vineland. Here, in the afternoon, cars were furnished and the members of the club were taken to various points of interest. One of these was the State Hospital for the Insan*'. with its companion institution, under private management, immediately across the road. This latter institu- tion, through its able heads and earnest work, has pained a world- wide reputation. The"
men,"were also taken to a scientific glass works, where they were"
shown,"the process- es of making glass instruments for scientific use. At Vineland a dance was given after the concert. In Bridgeton, no elaborate prep- arations for entertainment had been made, but one or two of the"
men,went to the glass works here on their
own,"hook, while othe^i, were initiated into the mysteries of the raceway. Following the concert a social wa.? held in the >>ehurch. It was at this concert that a most regrettable inci- dent occurred. Following the dui?t between Willman and Rounsley. they were called back to the stage by pro- longed and vocifcroup applause."
When,"they had gone out to bcw the'- acknowledgments, they were present- ed with a splendid houquft, consist- lug of one large eauliftow+r. Will-"
man,"Immediately began a bfarch fo'- the perpetrator of the foul deed, and with wRat result was evidenced by .i scone at the next concert. Rainy weather the r.txt day some- what dampened the spirits of the men, but after they had b<><<n fd in the church at West Chester, they re- vived considerably. Here the last successful concert of the trip wa.? given, annd here occurred the evi- dence of the -Kaleer's * detective work."

Wednesday,evening in a very ^^uccessful meeting.
An,excep- lionaly large audience was present la the Chapel to hear the stories of early Pennsylvania as presented by Ml.so Kathryn Bennett. This meet- ing marked the close of what has been :ather_ an innovation at Buck nell. The
Lyceum,was organized lAst fall i!'. re.->pouse to a long-felt need for a literary group in wl>ich those
who,"f 'It disposed could delve into the true and beautiful in literature, rnder the leadership of Donald (""lo- ward tl.U group has grown and pros- pered."
The,meetings were planned run only through the winter months
when,outdoor sports were not the all-absorbing interest. The large attendance
Wednesday,evening was a ntting climax for such a worthy effort. Miss Kathryn Bennett is a librar- ian in the
Brown,"Library, of Wi'l- lami^port. She is a popular story teller of the Natloiuil Story Teller- Leasut*. Her services are in"
demand,"by women's clubs, libraries and lit- erary societies of aJl kinds. Slie ha.- made- .ipecial researc ii into the folk- lore and traditions of Pennsylvania. Personally MLss Bennett was not at her host last week because of serious illness and a recent operation. Her collection of stories, iiowever, was e>:- cellent. It included"
many,interest- ing tales of different stages In Penn- sylvania hiotory. Mi.^.-. Bennett commetfted with th>> Indiau legends of
how,"things came to be. such as .how the robin's breast got red She followed with the tale of a Swedish girl, tlie sweetheart of a naturalist"
who,"was forced by her oomni'inity to marry a missionary to America, because the missionary needed a wife and she was the most li'uely i^irl in the community. They came tJ Pennsylvania, the missionary diea and their daughter died. The naturalist, hearins tbat the mission- ary and his wife had died, came V) America to honor their grave, found his sweetheart and married her They traveled up and"
down,"the coast studying the plants and America and finally returned to Sweden. The final act of the great epic, Evang"".'- ine was enacted in Pennsylvania. This story"
was,beautifiilly narrated by
Mi<<,"Bennett. The last story was of a romance of John Penn, th3 j Grandson of William Penn. John | 1 P..>r.n fell in love with the daughter ! of a chieft lia"
who,lived somev.here in the vicinity of Sunbury.
He,gained bar father's favor and returned to Philadelphia for the wedding prep- arations. While he was gone the Indian
m,aid was seduced by a young outcast of her tribe. She attempted an elopement with him but after- ward turned fi'om him to return to her people but was murdered by the outcast John Penn arrived for his bride but
was,forced to return t'l Philadelphia alone. Spring has closed and a successful season tor the
Lyceum,is closed. Biit next winter
we,
may,look for ar. even greater interest in this organi- zation.

K.,"Mohler and his assistants are working on it and are doing their best to put the track in good condition. The track has been partly raked and it is planned by the manager to cover the whole track with a layer of sieved cinders.

It Is hoped by the coach that a 1 team can be developed whieh will be capable of winning the champion- ships. Of course,"

number,of points. In every event

"Lewisburg,",
Pennsylvania,"AVhut the war did to the universi- ties and colleges In this country and in England, the present great famine i8 doing to those In China. The stu- dents are forsakHng their classroonv in response to a call for need. Several of the Chinese colleges al- ready have cloeed, and the students have gone to the stricken dlstricls in the quickly mobilized"
arm,of re- lief workers through whose efforts
many,
among,"the millions left desti- tute by flood and drought are being kept alive with food rushed in from the outside world. In other Institutions, where some students still remain, they are divid- ing their food with the starving folk of the five stricken provinces on the ""stint yourself to save"" plan."
And,this is one of the ctriking signs of the awakening in the new- republic for which our
own,"American colleges are largely responsible. Whatever progressive Western spirit China has today, she"
owes,to the young
men,
and,
women,"educated here and in Europe,"
many,of whose ex- pense* at American universities and colleges were paid for out of Boxer indemnity money. Her hope for the fuUire rests with
them and,with the students in the Chinese colleges mod- eled after our own. Before the call for
men,
and,
women,willing to endure hardship and hard
work,"in famine relef became po ur- gent, the 800 students of the Univer- sity of"
Nanking,petitioned the au- thorities of that institution to re- duce the
amount,of food served at the student table In order that
what,should be saved might be sent to the famine vlcitms.
They,"saved 1800 during the first half of the school year, besides con- tributing more than $3,000 in cash. $800 is a lot of"
money,in China. Board at the U. of
N.,"costs abou>> $3.50 a month. No, not a day, or -v^.eek-- a month! Figure up and you'll see that the Chinese student? really stinted themselves. They saved a good"
many,"lives. At current prices in China .their $800 would buy 20 tons of sweet potatoes, 13 tons of mllet, 5000 pounds of meat, or 8000 pounds of fish. Everywhere Chinese students are throwing themselves into the or- ganized effort to save their starving countrymen. In"
Soochow,University
Number,"three, a"
much,shaller insti- tution than the
U.,"of N., they saved $120 In a"
month,by denying them- selves meat and fish.
Many,of these
same,students are
now,in the famine provinces busy with the tremendous
work,of distribution.
Frow,
Huchow,comes
word,that tht; government schools in that vicinity raised a large
amount,of
money,by giving a series of entertainments which iRSted a week. In
New,York City they produced a Chinese play and turned the proceeds over to the The following is an extract from a letter from
West,"Chester. Pa., to Pres. Hunt. ""It gives"
me,great pleasure to give to you a report of the concert given here last week by the Bucknell Musical club.
The,program given by the hoys
was,high class and gave universal i-atlbfaction.
Many,words of commendation have
come,to
me,from those competent to express a judgement o nthe merits of the work done b ythe club. The concert
made,
much,"sentiment for Bucknell. In the afternoon of the day the concert was given, the boya gave a short program before the high school, which was excellent Indeed and"
won,"the student body. There will, I feel quite certain, be more students for Bucknell from"
West,Chester hereafter. The boys
won,"the confidence and esteem of everybody. Their conduct wa.s of the highest order and re- flected favorably the characterof Bucknell. 1 would earnestly advise that the college, faculty and student body, give the musical clubs next year, the best possible support and encouragement. The"
work,of th.' clubs is a very effective
way,"to advertise Bucknell."""

New,"York City; and In several institutions the adoption of the ""stint yourself to save"" idea, borrowed from the U. of N., is help- ing to swell the fund."
No,"contribution Is too small to be welcomed by the relief organixation. and none Is too large. For three cents, a famine victim, man,"
woman,"or child, can be supplied with food suf- ficient for a day; $1 will keep one alive thirty days; and $5 a"
month,will support a family.
But,the need Is great ; there are so
many,millions

LEWISBURG,
PENNSYLVANIA,
P*P,
The,"1922 L'Agenda has been coni- lileted: The final copy sheets liiive been forwarded to Baker-Jones-Hau- naiur, Inc , of Buffalo, the printers of the book this year, and tims has been completed what has all the appear- ances of being the best year book that has been published at Bucknell for some years. Finley Keech, the ed- * ,\6r. aided by his staff, has been working hard for peveral months In an tndeavor to"
make,"the book the very last word in college annuals for the year, and a book of which the college"
may,well be proud.
Word,comes back from the printers that
work,"on the book Is progressing nice- ly, and that the proof sheets will be forwarded in the very near future."
An,effort has been
made,"to get the book published before the contem- plated printers' strike, which is ex- pected the first of May."
The,"book is arranged Irt tw<<lvo Hections. or departments, consistinK of the"
new,"view section, the faculty, the classes, the music department, the fraternities, the Rlrls' fraternities, publications, college activities, liter- ary department .athletics, feature ;*-- lions and the advertising section. Of most of these,"
much,"has been said in previous material on the obok, bu* there is"
much,that has not been said about the book that cannot l)e ex- pressed until the publicatibn is dis- tributed to those
who,"have sul) wcrlbfed. Every department is com- plete in itself, and covers the life of the college from the issuing of last gear's book until the 15th of March, this year. In the department of publication-? Tvill be included the L'Agenda,"
The,"Bucknellian, The Alumni Monthly, the"
Commencement,"News, and last, but not least, the staff (?) of ""The Woodpecker,' the announcement of which will be awaited with"
much,"anxiety on the part of many. The view section contains only !liree pictures that have appeared in Jormer L' Agendas. Thus, covering t:ight pages,"
many,
new,"views of the campus and buildings will be pre- sented,"
making,"a splendid change in the book from previous years. Special mention should be made of the snow Kcene across the athletic field and the sunset view of the *Hill' 'from across the Susquehanna river. This view Kfcction is headed by a beautiful plate entitled *Campus."" which has been prepared by the printers, and which Hhows the Sixth Street entrance to the campus to good advantage. The departments of college organ- izations and activltie^ of former year.s have been combined in one depart- Bient this year, thus giving the whole range of college and student activ- ities in one section. The literary department, covering nineteen pages, is headed by a liter- ary masterpiece entitled. ""Nature's Setting for Bucknell,"" written by Dr. Martin in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the jniverslty. Four pages are devoted to this article."
The,"remaining pages contain the efforts of several of our budding authors, two of the.se en- deavors being illustrated to add to the novelty of the department. Sev- tral are of a more serious turn, and have real literary ability displayed in them. The athletic department Is com- plete, covering football, baseball, track, girls- athletics, the letter m'>n cf the class, and a splendid article on *The Beginning of Athletics at Buck- nell,"" by Prof. Bromley Smith, writ- ten after a great deal of research work along this line, going back a.? far as lJ>71t. Accounts"
and,"photos In connection with the Sophomore- Freshman football and basketball Fames are also included in this^ sec- lion. Of most vital interest will be the feature sections, headed by a neat drawing of one of our anuable fresh- men, and entitled, ""Dlabollqnes."""
And,the section is all the
name,ini- pliep.
With,appropriate dedication cf the department Fhere it rightfully (Turn to pftge two) The
management,of the L'Agend.i is still solidting orders for that an- nual.
One,"hundred more orders must Uv taken in order to cover all ex- penses and come out on top. Lets get behind it and see that more order.n are turned in. Only 325 copies, out of 938 students, have been ordered. Kveryone should have a copy by wliidi, in after >cars, to r^niembor their college days and college activi- ties. There are still 60"
members,of the Junior class
who,have not order- ed a L'Agenda. Surely they should have the annual of their
own,"class, their"
own,"class publication. Every- one should have a L'Agenda and more than the needed hundred should be ordered. .Manaf;< r Kyttle, or any"
member,of the board will take your order.

The,regular meeting of the Social and Industrial group was held in the reception room of the
Woman's,"Col- lege last Thursday evening. Th"" meeting was addressed by .Mr. b. B."
Cannon,"outlined some of the labor Car and Foundry Co., of Milton. Mr."
Cannon,"outyined sonje o fthe labor problems that had arisen in his plant and mentioned the steps that his firm had taken to meet them. Starting from his boyhood he traced the gradual develndiuenl of the labor unions up their present day organi- zation, and along with their develop- ment the grawth of the antogonistic spirit entertained toward them by capitol."
He,handled the situation in an absolutely iinbia.<<ed
manner,as l^
shown,"by hi.s explanation of what he thinks is the cause of the gradually increasing gulf between capital and labor ,and in what he thinks is a solution to the problem."
He,gave the following causes for the present crisis: (1) Alternate abuse of power. (2)' Suspicion and distrust (3) Failure to realize that their interests are mutual. In support of the firi-l cause he cit- ed the
manner,"in which labor,"
when,the
demand,for manufactured articles is great and
man,"power is .'scarce, sets exhorbitant prices upon its services."
Then,upon the other hand the pro- cedure of capital
when,the opposite condition obtains and workers are plentiful. The second cause needs no expla- (Turn to page two)

RECITAL,"With a week's additional practice and with loose ends, as were"
shown,in the (Jettysburg
game,"of last week, gathered tip by Coach Cockhill Bucknell'.-^ varsity nine struck it's .stride and handed a 15 to S defeat to the baseball team of the University of Delaware. The vaufiuished"
was,the same team which clouted Dart- mouth's gladiators over the Delaware field to the tune of 5 to 2. Delaware carried the same hard-Jilttlng short stop
who,knocked two
home,"runs against Dartmouth But nevertheless the scalp of the Delaware collegians haungs In Bucknell'.^ trophy room, a .-symbol of the"
game,which was one of hard hitting. The Orange and Blue nine took the heart out of the visitors in the first inning by bunching six hits for a score of four runs; after which suc- cess
Ramsey,"was replaced by Grubb. Bucknell n.en connected with mont of the deliveries of this second twirler and he \%as replaced in the sixth by Carll. Donoho and McDonald for Dela- ware and Linker and Julian for Bucknell each clouted pretty three- base hits, .scoring"
men,for their re- spective teams in each Instance. Bucknell'B first inning lead
was,a factor in smashing the morale of the
men,f;om Delaware. This advantage coupled with excellent cheering by the ^^udent body and pep-inspirina; muf ic from the college band aided and enabled the
men,to count at least one run in every inning but the sec- ond and fifth. There
was,no doubt at any time but that the victory was for Bucknell. Bellack pitched a steady
game,"and | altl.dugh the vi.-itors took 14 hits from him they were all well scattered and would have resulted in very little scoring, but for very costly errors. The fielding on the part of both teams was loose at times. Yet again there were"
many,good bits of field- ing wliich are worthy of featuring. Such was the fly which .Schultz nabbed between
thumb,"and fore-fin- ger as he leaped into the air and stoppf d the drive of Underwood as it sailnd swiftly by, tagged for center field. Bellak had in all. ten strike-outs, just twice as"
many,as the total of the .onib.ned pitching staff of Dela- ware. Coach Cockill is well pleased with the development of the Bucknell baseball team during the last week.
The,hitting in the Delaware game on
Wednesday,was a great Improvement over the showing of the
week,before.

EVENING,"The piano recital of Mr. Moyer, given last Thursday evening in the Baptist church proved to be one of the outstanding features of the sea- son. The church was filled to capa- city with a"
warmly,appreciative and enthusiastic audience. In the opening
number,"of Etude Symphonlqucs of Schuman. Mr. Moy- er's rhythmic sen.se was superb. His tone, singing at times, brittle at others,"
made,the
Schuman,"pieces in- deed memorable. The Chopin numbers, including a Ballade, Nocturne and Polonaise, were an exposition of fine feeling and adequate technique The group of modern compositions were given with real charm and true understanding."
The,"Scherzo, written by a young American composer"
now,"dead, was weird and fantastic and pre.scnted"
much,"food for the imagin- ation. In the last group the Paganini- Liszt Etude deserves particular mer- it, while the Nocture for left hand alone was unique. The closing"
num-,"ber. La Campanella. was most bril- liantly executed. The clarity and smoothness of the trills were truly remarkable. .Mr. Sloyer was obliged to respond with frequent encores during the evening, the last of which"
was,"a massive ocmposition in itself Bucknell University as well as the people of Lewisburg, can well be proud of such a brilliant and gifted pianist. Mr. Seaman, a"

He,was accompanied on the piano by Mrs. Moyer.

Omar,"Dewald. '23. is visiting with frirnds at Jersey Shore, over the week end. C. E. Derek, '22. spent Friday and Saturday at ble"
home,in Trevorton. Dr.
W.,"G. Owens,"
who,recently
made,"a visit to Japan, spoke at Sus- quehanna last week."
The,"following account was taken from ""The Su.-^- quehanna""; Dr."
Owens,"of the Bucknell Univer- >lty faculty gave to the students of Susquehanna a very inspiring and ed- ucational illUKtraled lecture on ""Life in China and Japan,' 'last Thursday iifternoon. Dr."
Owens,"was one of th"" delegates representing the United States at the World's Sunday School Convention held at Tokio. Japan. Through his wide experience and per- .^onal contact with the people of thc^ Orient, he was able to bring to his au- dience a lecture of great interest."
The,lecture was supplemented by th-i use of well-selected slides. Dr.
Owens,"^aid in part: ""Japan's highly developed educa- tional system was introduced and es- tablished by"
men,of our
own,colleger iind universities. Military tactics play an important part in their edu- eatlon and when drilling they
make,a very impressive looking body. For the younger students there are well directed methods of recreation. Agricultural pursuits are devoted chiefly to the growing of rice and the -ilk worm.
A,total of 17 per cent of the land is irrigated for the cultiva- tion of rice.
The,"tillage of the soil is intensive, altho greatly handi- capped by the lack of modern imple- ments."
Work,of this kind is done to a large extent by the cjolie
who,as a rule possesses great strength and vitality. Religion in Japan is gradually be- coming Christianized.
The,exquisite beauty and artistic effect produced by their
many,temples is proof that the Japane.-^e people have not lost j their artistic temperament. Dr.
uwens,"pictured the wretched and unhappy condition of the people of China, lif the more densely pop- ulated districts the famine has in- creased to such proportions that hundreds are dying dally. Ther.' .^eems to be an abundance of food in the laud but no"
money,with which to purchase It.
To,"the United State* with Its great wealth, China looks for salTation. The lecturer"
made,a strong plea In their behalf. The annual banquet of the Sopho- more class
was,held at the
Hopp,"Inn at Mifflinburg on Thursday evening, April the fourteenth. The affair wa- a great success and everyone present had a wonderful time. Jack Helle- well, the chairman of the committee, and the rest of the committee, cer- tainly de.-erve"
much,credit fcr the wonderful
way,in which everything was carried out and for the elaborate preparations that were
made,in or- der to
make,"the affair a success. The rest of the committee wa,-; crmposed of Donald A. Davis, Richard"
W.,"Shef- fer, Nevin"

M.,"Chap- man, Eugene Biddle. Elmer Custer, Alfred V. Jacobs, Carl F. Goerlitz. and J. Harold Watson. The crowd met at the Phi"
Gamma,Delta and the
Kappa,"Sigma houses at eight o'clock and journeyed to Mifflinburg 'n two large trucks. The trucks were crowded, and shortly af- ter leaving Lewisburg it began to rain but the spirit of the crowd ran high and even these discomforts could not succeed in putting a damper on the pep."
The,tables were prettily set with flowers in the center and with a
menu,"program at each plate. Eighty- four plates were served during th<< evening- a few more than had been expected, but all were accommodated. Everyone was hungry and fell to with a will. The menu: Oysters on Half Shell Celery Olives Salted Peanut.' Roast Chicken (Turn to page three) -B-"

FOR,
PARALYSIS,
"""We","are all suffering from paral- ysis of good intentions,"" said Miss Carlotta Conrad, the leader of Y."
W.,"C. A., last -Monday night, giving a diagnosis of the ailments of that or- ganization. She told first of the great work of the national organization and explained the meaning of the"
Y.,
W.,"C. A. triangle, the training of the mind, body and spirit. At Buck- nell the training of"
mind,"and body is taken care of, and the important work of the Y."
W.,"C. A. is to look after the spiritual welfare cf the girls. ""Before"
we,"went home."" she said,"
"""we","had a spiritual awakening, but over vacation"
we,"lost some of this enthusiasm, and it was at this time that this paralysis of good intentions set In."""
A,"good doctor not only diagrosrq a dlsea.sc. but also prescribes a cure, and Miss Conrad's .suggestions for arousing enthuf^iasm were: to attend all the .Monday evening meetings, to attend morning watch, ao attend the conference at Ea^Iesmere or to help send others ,to willingly suve on some committee. Miss Conrad concluded by '-^aying if the school would cooperate with the"
new,cabinet In all these things the
Y.,
W.,C. A. would soon rcccver and become a very flourishing organ- ization.
Guy,"Payne, the genial proprietor of the College Inn. ""On the Quad- rangle,"" treated Senior Council and a number of guests to its annual ban- quet at his place of business Friday evening. It will be remembered that Payne started llii.s cualom last yeai"
when,"Senior Council issued an order that the brigade of ducks kept by *Paynie."" should either be kept off the campus or executed. Payne re- sponded by killing the ducks and ihon asking Senior Council as his giiest.-. to feast oil the cause of the disturb- ance."
The,"dinner Friday evenuig wa.< even better than the Initial banquet, and was served in the best potjisble style. Promptly at 7 o'clock the following Seniors met at the Inn, ready tf5 d<<; battle with the tempting \i:uids: Dick Mason, president. Doc lVl(<lilei. Soup Moore, Holmes Douglass, Harg Smith, Chelt Smith. Nels Rouiisley, George Schuyler. Ted Salaczy uski, Burp Shelley, Doc Kohler, >Iarry"
Thomas,"and Corky Lewis. The guests of the evening were Dr. and Mrs Phillips, Registrar and"
Mr,"\ Thcron Clark, Prof.>> Rhodes"
and,"Prof. Rice. The banquet unwittingly '^t ivod a double purpose, as it turned out that Friday was the birthday of Dr Phil- lips, dean of the University, and ton- gratulaiions were extended tt him by the Council. The d.nner itself"
was,"an epiciuean delight. Sliced oranges, tomato salad, roast guinea hen, mashcil pc tatoes and a host of other good things to eat were placed before the huiigry seniors and their guests, .ind th. empty plates after an hour '^ lattk testified as to their goodness. After the main part of the dinnei each diner was served with a huge f:lice of pie with the nickname of each guest upon his special piece. Even the pro- fessors were not spared, oh Prof Rhodes proudly exhibited his piece with the"
name,"""Dusty"" upon it ir. large letters, while Prof. Rice held his aloft, showing to all the world that ""Jack has been inscribed there- on. Following the pie"
came,"lot cream and a demi-tasse, which com pleted the last expiring sigh to the gastronomic exhibition. After the dinner"
had,been wivcd President
Mason,"acted as toastnuu.tci and introduced Dr. Phillips 'jj"". the first speaker of the evening 1"" a few words, Dr. Phillips told of the organization of Senior Council eleven years ago, and commented on its growth, both in numbers and influ- ence. He said he believed th.nt the present Senior Council had done eve. 'thing in its power for the bet- terment of Bucknell, and that he was very well pleased with the worlc that It had accomplished during the pres ent school year. Registrar Clark was next called upon, and told"
how,"he had come tc have a great love for Bucknell In the short time that he had been here, and that this was In creasing every day. Professors Rice and Rhodes each gave excellent talks, carrying out the same general theme that Dr. Phillips had given. 11 wa:< remarked afterward by various"
mem-,bers of the council that these
men,seemed more like congenial alumni than
members,of the faculty. During the entire banqutt the
Forum,"orchestra played selections of popular music, which"
was,"greatly enjoyed by the diners, as was dem- onstrated by the loud applaui-e which followed every piece. At the clone of the dinner, each Senior and guest was presented with a beautiful rose, and the dinner ended with a snappr ""Bucknell-el-el"" for ""Puynte."""

In support of the third cause he stated that capital must be"
made,"to realize that without the support and cooperation of labor, its finance and brains will be worth nothing, and that labor mu.st be brought to re- alize that in order to function proper- ly as a unit It mu.st have the support and cooperation of capital. Until both sides realize these facts? a solution Is Impossible"
He,"then outlined the possible solu- tion to the problems, a solution which if followed, will lead to a Social De- mocracy. ( 1 ) Liberal pension system. (2) Thrift. (3) Religion"
He,explained that thrift today would
mean,"the accumulation of dol- lars and cent.s tomorrow, and that a pen.-ion sy.steni. a system which would retire a"
num,"at a rea.sonabh age with a liberal pension, would do mucli toward dt .r'.'aslng,thc t-xlstlnt;; gulf between the contending parties-. Such a system would remove the fear existing in the mind of labor, of some day being disabled and being forced to depend upon charity for support. In closing Mr."
Cannon,"said,"" Until you instill more of the religion and teachings of Christ into both capital and labor you are going to havf them clashing with each other and a condition of dt.'3sention and chaos thruout the world."
The,only .solution to the problems of this suffering old world Is a re-birth o fthe old-fashlor- ed prayer meetings and faith in Christ.
Many,students claimed that Sher- wood
Eddy,"was appioaching the pre- .-^tiit day crisis from a purely theo- retical angle and that religion and politics, or religion and buslnes.^ would not work together. But right here we have the very same solution offered by a practical man, a"
man,
who,"comes into actual contact with social and labor problems every day. The next meeting of the group will be held next Thursday evening at 7:00 o'clock, in the u.susol place. Th"" problems introduced by Mr."
Cannon,will be dlscu:.sod at length interesting and profitable assured to all
who,attend. .

More,
Than,
Money,There is a supreme satisfaction not to be measured by dol lars
and,cents which comes with the knowledge that you are engaged in a businss contributing to a permanent fund of
human,"happiness. The sale of Life Insurance is such a business. Life Insurance is thrift and protection, two fundamental elements in the scheme of a happy life, and to promote this is a"
work,worthy of any
man,or
woman.,That the public appreciates this service is best told by the fact that the volume of life insurance purchased doubles every ten years.
You,
may,possess the qualifications which will enable you to render this helpful service
and,permit you to share in the profits arising from the sale of this increased volume. Write the

Support,"matlc fraternity, should .surely pro- duce an excellent play. ""Lady Windermere's Fan"", deal with the Inside doings of society life, and tells the story of a ""good wo-"
"man""whom","thru sooiety gossip is be- lieved to be otherwise. However, the Ktory brings about the woman's tru? character, but nevertheless at the nd of the play one is left with var- ious problems in"
mind,"as to whether the outcome should be as it is. It has, to a certain extent the ""lived happily ever after"" ending, but proves that it is a play really worth whila, in that we cannot sit back and say and so it should have been "", with"
comment,"or discussion. Emily Devine will play the role of Lady Windermere, while that of Mrs. Evlynne, the good"
"woman,",' will be taken care of by
Mary,Appleman. Other female characters are distri- buted
among,"Dorothy Wilhelm, Ly- dia Coene, Matilda Bell,"
LaRuu,"Unge, Marjorie Sprout and Helen Graham. The role of Lord Windermere will be taken care of"
by,
BUI,"Hoffman, and ""Bobby"" Hartz will be cast as Lorti Darlington. D."
H.,"Stewantson, F. S. Bees, F. F. Reamer, and Harry F. Roye wil also have considerable part In the play. Tickets will be on sale this week at the"
Women's,"College, the frater- nity houses, the ""Hill' as well as the town, which the co-eds expect to can- vas. Admission will be Fifty centa with budget ticket, Seventyfive centa otherwise The caste Lord Windermere,"

TENNIS,
MATCH,
"WEDNESDAY,",
2.30,"The Bucknell tennis team will play their first match this year, Wednes- day afternoon"
when,they meet the Susquehanna four on the S.
A.,"E., Phi"
"Gam,",
Lynn,and McClure courts. It is not
known,as yet
who,"will re- present Bucknell as Lybarger, Brandt Goho. Purnell, Freeman and Koch have been"
making,strong bids for the four places. The four
men,
who,play Wednesday will probably
make,"the trip to State (.loUeKc on Suluiuitj. La.st ><:;ar Buck nell lost to State, at State but were on a fair road to victory in the match tiere"
when,"rain interfered, so every I ffort will be"
made,"to defeat State this year ilfismuch as only one mat(h has been arranged. Plans for the Senior Class play are piogressing in fine shape and the committee under ""Abe"" Heller, is working hard to"
make,"It a big suc- cess. The play to be presented it ""Seven Keys to Baldpate,"" which is one of the biggest comedy successes of the American stage. It has run for a long time in our larger cities and everywhere was met with great en- thusiasm. It has just been released for stock production"
and,used by stock companied for two year run- ning:. Everywhere it has been a great -ucceKs and
we,are assured of a great treat.
The,play will be presented in
Com-,
mencement,"Hall on June 13. The leads will be taken by Martha Leiser and ""Abie"" Heller and all"
who,"have seen them in numeroiis plays beforf presented, in which they took the leads together,"
know,that their act- ing is 'insurpas.sable.
The,"suppoi;ting cast will be the beat ever picked in a class play here, because of tho large amount of talent In the clas.s, both"
men,and women. Rehearsals will begin the first week in May. The scenery will be entirely new and
made,"especially f<<.:' this production. Next week further announce- ments concerning ""Seven Keys to Baldpate"" will be"
made,"thru the Bucknellian. Opening matters for Bucknell as lead-off man, Johnny Dietrich's drive deep Into center field, allowing"
him,"to circumnavigate the sacks, regis- tered the only score in the"
game,"against Lebanon Valley last Friday on Tustin Field. Dietrich on this ini- tial trip to the plate ignored the first offers of Wltmere, pitcher for Leba-"
non,"Valley, and with two Htrikc.> called against him, stepped into the third pitched ball with a wealth of weight and pounded the pill clean over the center fielder's head. Nif- tUy stepping around the circuit, Johnny"
"""D""",was
home,"long before the relayed bell came to the waiting catcher. This first inning score was a gold nugget for Bucknell, for in the r*-- maining tight periods the Orange and Blue"
men,"could connect with Wlt- niere's offers for only one single Bellak allowed only four hits which his running males, with excellent fielding, qukkly disrountod. Both pitchers kept the lid tightly on the opposing team and retired"
man,after
man,"in 1, 2, 3 order."
The,contest
was,"a struggle for eight innings with the result always in the balance. Kostor- drcv the other hit from Wltmere and progressed to the third bag, but got left"
when,Witmere stiffened and threw just eight balls Linl^er faced for the first time this season a left handed pitcher and fail- ed to draw anything. Jones sprinting ability saved what would have been the only three bast hit of the
game,
when,"li<< rushed over to ""Doc"" Bar- tol'>* and nabbed Moore's fly. The in field for Bucknell worked with out an error in close effort with their pitcher. It was a real baseball game, with the"
home,run the winning fac- tor for Bucknell.

WHY,
IS,
IT,?
Now,"that the iKiseball season had begun, every dtudent, whether he in an athlote or not, takes great piido in liavinK a winning team. Having i winning team he likes to see th'; score of hiH team in Important news- papers so that his frlend.s"
may,see what hla school is doing. The Phila- delphia papers are not only willing but glad to publish any score.s that are sent to them. All the nearby col lege.* and even the high Bchools have their scores printed but Bucknell doe.- not.
Why,la it?
When,
W8,"were ""defeated in our flr.Ht"
game,"our .score appeared tlu^ next day, but."
when,"our team played a wonderful gome, and won, nothing was published. Thi.s has occurred two times so far during the present season."
Why,
w,if Is some one neglecting his duty?

human,nature and u definity aim of service. She said the tragic part of college education ia i that so
many,"leave, not with these high ideali and alms, but with a desire to hav-? a good time ,or to get"

we,cannot let college
make,"snobs of us, for a servant cannot be a snob."
We,"must be familiar with world happings and broadened by world interests. College should raise our estimate of our fel- low men, thit"
we,
may,"have faith In them and desire to serve them. She then continued to discuss the practical ways that every one of \is can .serve. First she mentioned the great field of missions, and that of social work"
m,cities.
But,she said tho
many,"of us are not able to serve as niLssionaries, there is plenty to do right In our"
own,

who,live in little towns she cautioned against going
home,with a snobbish and superior alti tude. which would
make,people re- .sent any service we would try to do.
We,should show them
we,have
grown,"bigger, not smaller."
We,have a chance to do church
work,"and mis- sionary work at home, and as guar- dians of"
Camp,Fire organizations and as teachers we have great opportuni- ties to influence the

BRITISH,
UNIVERSITIES,"According to a recent i.ssue of ""School Life."" Germany's character- istic academic degree, the Doctorate I of Philosophy will hereafter be con- ferred by British Universities. This 'determination is the result of a rec- 'ognition"
made,"early in 1918 by the 1 Prime Minister's Committee, upon Uhe position of Natural Science In the educational system of Great Britain. .Whether this will result in the dethronement of the traditional British Master of Arts is not"
now,es- tlnmted. It
may,"be regarded, how- ever, as a step devised to lure Amer- ican students in increasing numbers from the"
German,unlvresities which they frequented for half a century before 1914.
The,announcement Is
made,"that the degree is offered by the Univer- sity ot Oxford and the municipal uni- versities of Birmingham, Bristol, Durham, Leeds. Liverpool. London, Manchester and Scheffleld; by the University of North Wales, Bangor; by the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, and by Trinity College, Dublin.

"""Andy""","Wilson, ""ould only secure one"
game,"in two KEURt8. ""Bill"" easily took the match. 6-1, 6-0. In doubles, Lybarger and"
Koch,met with a little more opposi- tion but had no difficulty in finally *winning. Gedrich lost his singles to Bogs but with
Goho,"finally defeated Boggs and Parsons In straight sets, both of which were deuced. ""Steve"""
Goho,
made,his first appearance as a
member,"of the team and played like a veteran, easily winning his singles und putting"
up,an excellent defensive
game,in doubles. All of the matches were decided In Htralght sets with the exception of Koch's singles.
He,"and Parsons waged a pretty even battle with the former finally winning by the score C!f 6-3. 6-8, and 8-6. State seemed very anxious to se- cure a return match and it is quite likely that"
Manager,Sowers will ar- range to play tliom here on June 10.
The,result of the State match gives promise of the tennis team's completing a successful season.

BRYAN,
SPEAKS,"""W^Jiiini Jennings Bryan spoke in Milton last Thursday evening. By special arrangement he stopped off at Bucknell Friday morning and spojte to the student body a.ssembled in"
Commencement,Hall. Mr. Bryan
commenced,his speech by remarking on his love for college students and work
among,them and his purpose to spend more and rnorj^ of his time
among,"them. Ills address was essentially a plea for full round- ed development, mentally, physically and morally."
He,"stressed especially the moral development, rebuking any system of education or system of thought which destroyed a man's be- lief in God and his faith in his fel- lowmen. Mr. Bryan was well re- ceived and his visit kindly appreci- ated."

We,"were entered In the fourth gro\ip of colleges, comprised of Muhlenburg. Bucknell, Gettysburg, Franklin and Marshall, Catholic University, Colby, Manhattan and Washington and Jef- ferson, In their order from the pole. Colby"
made,"fir.-^t place with a time of two minutes thirty-three and two- fifth seconds, a"
new,record for this class. Bucknell finished second. Wa.shton and Jwfferson third and Franklin a.jd Marshall fourth. Our time was one of the best In all the college events. Every
man,"ran a good quarter, all averagnlg less than fifty-three seconds. Colby had two forty-nine second"
men,on her team; they
won,simply because they could run faster.

name,I tagged to his back and a contest was run at once to see
who,"could collect the o.-^t names. Appropriate prizes were awarded to Francis VanCleaf and Ike Humphrey. As a further ""mixer"" th Juniors divided them- selves Into twelve groups represent- ing the months of their respective birthdays."
Each,"group then gave a tableau to represent their month. September won, even though they could not ^et the statue of"
Venus,de Milo to represent the well-known fe- male
named,for the ninth month.
By,"an eleventh-hour permi.ssion from Miss Carey, dancing was permitted for onehalf an hour."
To,the
harmony,"produced by Wilson, Allan and Hoffa the clas."""
made,"the most of those thirty minutes between nine-thirty and ten o'clock. Refreshments were served, songs and yells were wafted to the squirrles, and a really jolly bunch of Juniors disbanded aa ten- fifteen. The clas.s extend their thanks to Chairman"
Law^on,"and his com- mittee, and to Miss Armstrong and Miss Fowler,"
who,acted as chaper- ones. for the occasion. After his musical numbers the boys gathered In a fire- .slde circle (every
man,
making,his
own,fire) and told stories.
On,"ac count of space the stories cannot be published In the Bucknelllan. Great credit is due Chairman ""Dutch"" .Miller and his comlttee for their part In the success of the smoker. The Juniors of '22 and their Senior guests had a royal time. The regret was expres.""ed by"
many,"that more such occasions cannot find a place in the college year. The Civil Engineering Society will meet In Euepla. Main College, on .Monday evening."

The,worries and cares of '22 went up in smoke Thursday evening.
The,third ytar nien and quite a few Sen- iors met at the
gymnasium,for one of the jclliest events of the year. Cig- arettes and cards were first in order. But soon the cigars were passed and the
men,gathered in a crlcle to watch some clever bouts. Eddy Treadwell and
Ada,"Klein first entered the ring .-ind proceeded to wallop each othei- for three rounds. At the request of Treadwell, however, the second and third wtre"
made,"one-minute rounds, with two-minute intermissions."
Hunt,and Wilsbach were booked to wrestle but ofter witnessing this battle they decided ot box. The.se
two,giants showed three rounds of good boxing.
No,"one was knocked out. however, except Referee Julian,"
who,tripped over a mat. Jlmmle Earle and Johnny Johnson next came on the mat for a wrestling match. After a fast tangle the
Smoke,Shop proprietor was thrown for a down.
The,pro-
gram,"was concluded with a bout be- tween Tcmjiiy Horan and Steve Hod- oba, for the championship of Locust Gap. Both boys showed good form, but they were too"

PROM.,"The Junior Prom, given last Friday night in the Lewisburg club by the class of 1922, was one of the most successful events of the year. About eighty-five couples attended, which did not overcrowd the hall too"
much,to interfere with the dancing.
A,great deal of credit should be given Chairman Diffendafer and the cimit- tee for the commendable
manner,in which the dance was given.
A,"for- mal dance with Seminary girls In at- tendance is not an every-day occur- rence and it Is safe to say that every one enjoyed the affair to the utmost. Refreshments consisting of Ice- cream, cake and coffee were served at Interlssion at 10:30."
A,"bowl of punch was placed at the disposal of the guests early in the evening and proved to be a very popular spot a.s the eveninr wore on. The progranis of the dance were especially pleas- ing, being"
made,of a dark blue leather with an orange
"""B""",stamped on tho face and the whole fastened with an 'orange cord. 'Dlffy's College Five ' furnished most acceptable dance
mu-,"sic from 7:30 to 12 o'clock,"
when,"they unpleasantly reminded everyone with ""Home. Sweet Home,"" that it was time to go ""there."""
CO-ED,
FUNCTIONS,
The,"Junior girls took full advan- tage of ""Junior"
"Week""",and
made,mrry from beginning to end. On
Monday,evening there was a table party after which the Freshman girls entertained the Juniors with a
mock,"wedding, followed by dancing. Tuesday evening the Juniors at tended ""Lady Windermere's Fan."" in a body."
Wednesday,"afternoon there was a movie party. In the evening they were royally entertained at a reception by the Junior boys. Thursday afternoon all hiked to ""Shriner's"" where a bountiful supper was devoured."
Then,an almost un- heard-of thing occurred
--,the girls attended the second
show,"of the movies. Next on the program came tho ""Prom,"" 'with a"
mock,
prom,"at the ""Sem"" for those"
who,were not for- tunate enough to go to the Club. The crowning events of the
week,"came on Saturday,"
when,the girls en- tertained at a tea-dansant in the af- ternoon and in the evening the girls did justice to a chicken and waffle dinner at Sleinlnger's. Thus ended one of the most de- lightful and successful Junior weeks there ever has been. Bucknell
Day,will bo celebrated next Saturday.
May,"the seventh. This event, held for the first time last year, should become one of the high lights in the life of Bucknell. Sev- eral events are already Kcheduled Saturday morning will witness a base ball classic between the"
Forum,"plH- twlrlers and a tea composed of non- fraternity men. Those wlu^ have witnessed such contestf,"
know,"that these ""fluke"" games are more inter- setlng to watch than any varsity con- test. The"
game,Is called for ten o'clock.
An,Interclass track meet will be held in the afternoon at 2:30. Every
man,
who,has ever taken part in any track or field event is req^iested to come out and
make,"it a real event. All entries must be in the hands of Manager Mohler by Tuesday,"
May,3. Positively no names will be accepted after that date. Entry blanks
may,be obtaind at the gymnasium.
The,annual
May,
Day,program will ahso be staged in the afternoon.
By,all the signs of the seasons the fairies and the butterflies are due to flutter about
m,all the frolicsome gaiety of spring.
And,"then just to show a few scoffers that we have ""queens"" at Bucknell,"
we,want to see
who,will be
May,Queen.
Our,
May,
Day,is a distinctively Bucknelhan event: let \is support It.
No,"definite program has been ar- ranged for Saturday evening, but it is understood that the fraternitie.^ will keep ""open house."" This cus- tom presents one of the best o<'ca- sions for the Intermingling of frater- nity and non-fraternity men. Buck- nell Day is a"

when,"Jones aided by Linker was en- abled to turn his hit Into the run column, Bucknell won from Duquesn. last Wednesday on the"

draw,more than four hits fro
"m""Doc""","Grieb, twirling for Bucknell. They did their tcorinp on an trror of Schultz', two prett.v steals"
and,finally an advance by Me- Knight allowed Kiinging to strolji across the pan. This was only ac- complished in the 5th. after Bucknell had counted another for themselves. DeCc?ursey had his scoring ma- chiine working and
made,"three of Bucknell'f runs. In the fourth frame he slammed out a 2-base hit, reach- ing third through Schultz' sacrifice, and turned in"
home,
when,Kecfc fumbled Harris 'single
down,2nd ba-ne way. In the 6th he did some pretty foot work around the corners and counted for another
when,Bellack's slam allowed him to register. De- Coursey wr^s first

STUDENTSTORUM,
V;HY,
NOT,
COLLECT?,on the
campus,"is a college student. Furthermore if a, visitor sits beside a band"
man,ho is immune.
Why?,This Is the (luostion the writer would like the
A.,A. to answer. At the Bucknell-Penn
game,last fall every student entering the gate paid before he entered. At Ilarris- burg tht>
same,was true. Is It don.' this
way,"at Bucknell? True,"
we,do not have a stadium. But are
"w""",
making,the best of that which wo
we,have? It
may,be the visitors or those skipped are friends? Is tlh:; athletic as.sociation run upon friend- ship?
The,answer is unduubtodly no; It Is run upon business principle.? and so it should be.
The,writ<<:r isn't kicking about the kids seeing the game.
He,
was,once a sand-lot player and enjoys athletics. AVhat is wroni? is that the methods of collecting from those
who,"should and can pay, are carelessly thrown to tli wind."
The,writer has seen
money,not col- lected at the last two games.
Money,that was out in plain sight but was ignored and then put back Into the pocket.
The,"games have been worth the price, .^"
why,not collect? It is true also that the reply
may,be that this Is only a slip-up. The writer has ob.served it for four years but not so pronounced as this year. Let's pull the loo.se dollars in and soon will be pulling In the interest on thost; few dollars and will be hun- dreds a^ead. Then Bucknell will be able to bring not only Lafayette here but also the
Navy,or some otlier bi^ team as well. Then and then only can
we,"miv: ""We're out \o win. one and all."
What,Is more
we,will win
--,financially.

An,agitation was begun .some time ago which has
now,reached National proportions urging the repeal of tho 10 per cent war tax on sporting goods and practically every National
Ama-,teur A!^.soclatlon has gotten behind the
movement,and hundreds of thou- sands of individuals also. Peter P. Carney and
Hugh,"Fuller- ton, two of the best"
known,"sports writers in the United States, -have written quite a"
number,"of articles th.owlng the un.ioundne.-;s of the tax,"
how,"it prevents the play of the youth of America, and Its future effect on the Natioa. The:-,e writers"
now,ask that every student of every institu- tion become interested in this movi--
ment,"and urge for the repeal of the tax. Everything you purchase to bo used for sports play, whether it be a"

We,"waste more than $25,000,000 a year in trees that"
we,allow to burn up. The other day
we,heard of fifty- one forest fires going on in the same State at the same time. W^e find duplications in govern-
ment,",two and three and even four bureaus having jurisdiction over the same thing. Waste of labor, time and money. Thousands of hotels and teuF of thousands of restaurant.-^ in America charge high prices because thci- patrons"
demand,"qualities of food,"
much,"of which is left on the table-. Most of the costly food that is thu.- left behind, goes into the garbap; can."
Which,
means,that the diners wasted huge
sums,of
money,"in the aggregate, and caused great waste of precious food. It is a rare thing not to find waste In American indxistry."
Go,to almo.<<t any oil well and note
how,
much,oil flows away. Visit almost any factory and mill and about the first thinj: your eye falls upon is some wasted thing. It is so in most homes and in
many,barns and fields. Waste in greater or lesser degree. Yes. his middle initial is

"MIFFLINBURG,",
PA.,
On,Saturday one of the best and closest inter-class meets seen at Bucknell in years
was,witnessed on Tu^^tln Field as a part of the program f(.!- nucknell Day.
The,"day was ideal f(,r a track and field meet except for a V,, eeze which struck the runners on llie back stretch and for a few drops"
a,rain which fell at the beginning of the contests. Very fast times were made in a
number,"of the races and the Held events were also quite good. The points were for a long time in favor of the Freshmen and it looked a<< if the Sophomores, last year's vic- tors in the inter-class meet, would po"
down,in defeat. The class of '23 was without three of her point-scor-
ers--,Wren.
Chapman,"and Davis, but in the last few events she took all the points and"
came,"through with flying colors. The last two events, the broad"
jump,"and the half-mile, were taken entirely by Sophomores. Tvhlch added twenty points to their tally This made a total of fifty-six points, giving them a margin of ten points over the Freshmen with forty- Bix points. The Junior class had the third largest"
number,"of points, fin- ishing with thirty-one."
The,"Senior track team, represented by Ein.- Smith, finished last but not least, *with two points to their credit. Joseph was the outstanding star of the meet, scoring eighteen points jn all for his t6am. He"
won,"the 100- yard dash, the 200-yard dash, the quarter mile r.nd was second in the high jump. That is a mighty fine record for one afternoon. His time in all of these events, was, moreover, exceptionally fast. His time In the century of 10 1-5 was equal to Love"

REMEMBERED,"Counting on Its program an inter- fraternity baseball game, an inttr- class track meet, the"
May,"Day exer- cises and with all festivities clumin- ating in dances and smokers which fraternities conducted throuEiliout the evening, Bucknell Day"
was,"com- pleted most successfully last Satur- day. The houses were full to over- flowing, the affair"
was,"complete in every way. As a campus custom, Bucknell"
Day,has become established at this insti- tution
What,it
may,"become can be persaged in the position of import- ance to which Penn State has rai?de *'Pennsylvania Day."" At ten o'clock Saturday morning the"
Non,Frats proceeded to take over the
Forum,"nine on the diamond of the athletic field. They proved their superiority during the entire nine innings. The contest, however, showed flashes ot skillful playing and unwarranted ""hukes"" as such games are"
want,to do.
Th,eafternoon found straw hatb- and white flannels prevailing
among,"Lebanon Valley College, playing on their"
home,"diamond at Annville nosed out the Bucknell nine in the eighth,"
when,"they siicceeded in regis- tering two runs on a squeeze play. After pitching masterfully, retir- ing six men and allowing no hits during five innings. Bellak was forced to give Uhler a single, which point put the skids under Bucknt'l. Scorelebs until the eighth, the con- test presented a replica of the one held in Lewisburg between the same teams. It"
was,"close fielding, good pitching and a fight every minute on the part cf the clubs. In the eighth Uhler pounded out to center field and"
was,credited with a hit. He stole second while the next
man,took three balls and then chased home as Cohen drew a triple instead of a walk.
With,only one
man,"out for Leban- on Valley things looked good. Ho- man, sacrificing perfectly, squefzed the play across and the scoring wa^ ever. Buknell went to bat deter- mined but were unabel to deand any- thing from Wolfe."
The,"lack of prac- tice for the three days of the trip, all other games having been can- celled, showed In this inability to stage a ninth-inning rally. Lebanon Cohen, f*"

Lybarger. Brandt. Goho and Koch all played their usual brand of consistent ten- nis and were not even forced at any time to exert them.>^elves, which fact 1b evidenced by the scores. Manager Sowers has arranged to play the strong Swarthmore team on Bucknell courts next Friday after- noon at 2:30. After defeating Penn State and Susquehanna the tennis team desires to"
make,as good a show nlR as possible against Swarthmore and to get in the best possible shape for the
New,York trip which will be- gin on
May,23rd. This trip will in- clude
New,York University. C. C. of
N.,"Y., Rutgers. Moravian, Lafayette and Lehigh."
Some,good tennis teams are included in that line-up but ou * racquet wielders are determined to
make,"them hustle in order to win. The scores with Susfjuehanna were as follows: Singles Lybarger defeated Stong, 6-2. 6-2. Koch defeated Decker, 6-1. 6-0. Brandt defeated Matteson, 6-1. 6-1."

PENNSYLVANU,"joy's best time of last year, in the furlough of 23 seconds is only 4-5 of a second slower than the Bucknell record for that event. His time in the quarter was exceptionally fast."
He,"ran this in 51 3-5 seconds, very close to record time."
Hahn,"was his runner-up in all these events, finis^hing second In the 100. the 220"
and,the quarter-mile.
On,"account of the fast times, It took a good"
man,to stick as close to Jo- Beph as
Hahn,did in these events. Treadwell also
was,"an outstanding star, winning three first places in the meet."
He,"finished first in the 120 high hurdles, in the high jump and in the discus throw."
He,scored 16 points In all for his class. The high
jump,was
won,
by,him at five feet six jnhes.
He,ran the high hurdles in 3 8 3-5 and threw the discus 105 feet and 2 inhces. Treadwell is a fine all-'round athlete. Schmidt also talUed eleven point-^ for the Junior class.
He,
won,both of the distant races without
much,"difficulty. His time in the mile was pood, finishing in 4 minutes and 51 Keconds: but the two-mile race was slow. Dlnn, our star broad jumper, not only finished first in this event, hut also"
won,the shot put.
He,has a mighty leap and can leave quite a bit of ground under
him,"after he leaves his take-off board before con- necting with the saw-dust. Haslam. of course,"
won,"the pole-vault with a jump of 11 feet and 4 Inches. This was within two Inches of his former record and about 4 Inches better than lie was doing this time last year, so chances for breaking his"
own,record look good. Dayhoff. of

won,"the half mile In the exceptional time of 2 minutes and 6 4-5 seconds, which is also quite close to the Bucknell record."
He,"had previously run a fast quarter, finish- ing third, and he has wonderful op- portunity to break the Bucknell rec- ord for this event."

New,"York, and has been on tour for three years. The comedy deals with the experiences of a wealthy young ?tockbroker"
who,"pledges himself to tell 'nothing but the truth"" for a period of twenty-four hours. The ab- surd and complicated situations that arise are extremely humorous."
The,entire cast has not been se- lected but Francis

who,"are affiliated with the fraternity as mothers and wives, an informal reception for the entertainment of the thirty ladies"
who,were present.
The,"program had been arranged with Diffy furnishing the music. The entertainment was, for the most part, on the porch, although the boys took great pleasure in having the ladies inspect the interior of the house as well. Everyone had a very enjoyable afternoon. The hoys hav- ing mothers present generously shared with those not so fortunate."
A,feature of the occasion
was,the
number,of mothers present
who,do not live in this vicinity. During the course of the afternoon a dainty luncheon was served. Later in the day a picture of the group was taken. After some more pleasant visiting the mothers were motored to their re- spective homes.

SCHOLARSHIP,
GRANTED,
A,scholarship worth 1100.00 has b<<en granted to Peahody High School. Pittsburgh. Pa.
What,"promises to be a real musical treat is i nstorc for the students of Bucknell University. This evening at 8 o'clock, the Men's Glee Club and the Girls' Glee Club will give a joint concert In"
Commencement,"Hall. Both the clubs have done i^ome ex- cellent work this year. The girls' club, especially, has prospered ex- ceedingly, and"
made,hits both in its
home,"appearances and in its concerts in surrounding towns. The chorus work Is excellent, while the solo work cannot be surpas.<<ed in its line. Nor did this cluh. in preparation for its public appearances, forget to add ii touch of comedy to its program. The men's club enjoyed one of the most .successful reasons in their his- tory. Because of the fact of the * hange to the semseter system, the number of tri, s taken was increa.sed while their duration decreased. V trip to the western part of the state .nt Thanksgiving time, a trip into the northern part of the state at Christ- mas, a trip to"
New,"Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during the Easter vaca- tion and several week-end trips to surrounding towns, furnish evidence as to the activity of the club. Every- where it did such excellent work that the task of securing dates for next year, in its early development, ha- proved to be greatly facilitated."
The,"following program will he given this evening, and students and faculty are urged to hear this joint concert: *The Genetian- - Berwald Girls' Club. Violin Solo - Robert Hartz Songs - Girls- Double Quartet Misses Thomas, Wagner, Hazen, Vancleaf. VanCleaf,"
Hunt,Coates. Martyrs of the Arena - DeRllle Men's Club De Coppah
Moon,- Girls' Club vocal solo - Miss
Hunt,"p,,gj . ""Stabat Mater Misses Hunt and Hazen Ho, Gallant Sailors -"
Macy,Men's Club.
A,glance at the above programme will show It.-^ excellence both as re- gards balance and selections. It is Turn to Page Four Saturday morning witnessed a Kood-natured battle between the For-
um,and Non-Fraternity
men,"on the local diamond, in which the Non- Frats came off victorious to the tun-; of 8-3."
The,"course of the game wa.- typical of the ""classic"" events staged"
among,"the different college group.v *Catch-as-catch-can"" about describe; the type of baseball. The Non-Frats got a running start and held their opponents scoreless unt.l the fifth,"
when,"an error by Woodside gav? them their start to advance three runs against the Non-Frat's five. In the next inning, however, the ""Mon- grels"" again started circling the bases and the game ended al the seventh, 8-3. In spite of the fact that such rame.s are"
won,"and lost en errors and *flukes."" some real baFthall was shown. The Non-Fraternity"
men,owe their victroy in a large part to the superior pitching of
Mac,Leonard. Noone
knows,"where be learned to twirl the horse-hide, but he certainly had stuff"" on the ball- Fry had plenty of steam and pitched a good"
game,Errors were prevalent on both .sides;

PENNSYLVAinA,I hurdles both Tread look part. Both
men,laces but the other were too fast for them and they were both eliminated. In the trial beats of the 4 40-yard run
we,"had two men-^Joseph and Hahn. participat- ing. There were three trial heats, the first three of each heat to qual- ify for the finals. Joseph, although badlv spiked at the start of his race, ran a mighty pUicky and fast race and"
won,his heat in exceptoinally fast time
Due,to the crowding at the Btart he
was,"forced back, but on the back stretch, with a wonderful burst of speed, he forced himself up"
among,the leaders and maintained his po- sition until the home-stretch where he gradually forced himself into the tead.
Hahn,"ran in the next heat and he laso ran a mighty heady and fast race, finishing second in hi^ heat and thereby qualifying for his finals."
He,also got
way,"to a bad start, but on his first turn forced himself to the front and by a hard sprint finished second."
Hahn,"and Joseph both ran their heats in 52 seconds flat. Dayhoff ran in the low hurdles but did not succeed in qualifying for the semi-finals. The field was too fast .for Harry and, though he ran a game race, he"
was,"outclassed. In the 220- yard dash, Joseph again did him.self proud, finishing second and thu.A *iualifying for the semi-finals. In the field events all the"
men,
who,"practiced in the morning were elim- inated with the exception of Ha.slam,"
who,qualified for the finals. Trials in the broad
jump,were not held until the afternoon. Treadwell and
Wren,both entered the high
jump,"and made some fine jumps, but the field was a mighty classy one and they were eliminated. Wilsbach partici- pated In the trials of the shot-put and discus-throw but did not succeed in qualifying for the afternoon events. Treadwell also entered the discus but did not qualify. The team was entertained for din- ner by the"
Kappa,Alpha fraternity. They put up a mighty fine dinner for the team and entertained them In flro Htyle. Nothing seemed too
much,"trouble to them while looking afte,- the comfort of the team. In the afternoon the first final event in which Bucknell took part was the finals of the 4 40. in which both Joseph and"
Hahn,had qualified.
Hahn,drew position
number,4 while Joseph drew the extreme outside po- sition. In thf fight for the pole
Hahn,"was thrown and spiked by a fallen runner. Regaining himself at a ten- yard disadvantage, he succeeded In reaching the leaders before the sec- ond turn by an effort which"
made,him unable to place In the final sprint.
Harmer,of Delaware
won,"in 61 4-5 seconds, Joseph following him by 8 matter of Inches. >rurn to Page Three wife at the duor. Surprise was ex- of evenin.i pressed at the appearance preparation on the part of Mrs. Dav- i>^."
A,"second .-surprise soon came in the greeting of the guests present. The clever arrangements were moving in order and soon the chimo:^ sounded. As the guests moved into the dining room each took his place where he thought he belonged, which place he chose by selecting a sou- venir of the evening which he sup- posed suited."
Then,each read a cleverly written
name,card and if it suited the penson he remained where he was. If the
name,"card did not Piiit, the reader changed places witli the person to"
whom,"the verse al- luded in ""life occupation."""
When,"all had been rightfully as- signed tu his place, a most delightful dinner"
was,"served. Miss Davis helping in giving the family touch to the evening. The dinner ended with each receiving a remembrance souvenir of the event. After dinner the guests were enter- tained by Prof. Stewart, using his character sketches. The.-e were thor- oughly enjoyed by all. The plans of the evening were to"
commemorate,"the ending of Dr .Da- vis' twenty-fifth year on the teaching staff at Bucknell. * Dr. Davis,"
now,"head of the Bio- logical department, has done a serv- ice any"
man,can well be proud of in life.
He,is the

Perry Rogers *22, and Roy Land.s '22, represent- ing the Bucknellian, attended the semi-annual conference of the Inter- collegiate Newspaper Association of the Middle Atlantic States, held at Getty.sburg, last Friday and Saturday. This association includes weekly n.wspapers of nineteen colleges of Pennsylvania."
New,
York.,
New,"Jersey, Delaware and Maryland most of which were represented at this conference."
The,"business meeting, held Satur- day morning, was of keen Interest to anybody interested in collegiate newspaper work. Professor Sander;, of the Gettysburg faculty, gave a live wire talk on the opportunities and responsibilities of collegiate newspa- pers. Colletie journalism, he said, i.- a"
new,"thing, not found in European institutions, an outgrowth of Amer- ican democracy."
A,"collegiate news- paper, like any newspaper, is a shaper of public opinion. Just as Cleon was the most dangerous^"
man,"in Athens In the time of Aristotle, because he"
knew,
how,"to appeal to the superficial Impulses of the people, so the jour- nalist becomes dangerous"
when,he over-emphaslzefc the insigniflacnt and refuses to deal with the big construc- tional ideas of his time.
A,"collegi- ate newspaper must do more than report happenings, it must strive at dealing with big questions in a truly literary way. Election of officer? for the coming year was conducted, George Schuyler acting as chairman <f the nominat- InK committee. Richard Slocum of Swarthmore"
was,elected president;
Roy,
H.,"Landis, business manager of the Buknellian,"
was,elected treasurer of the association. The Bucknellian was hospitably received by her old rival. Every op- portunity was taken by the Gettys- burgians to show their guests a good time.
On,"Saturday afternoon the en- lire conference was conducted over the battlefield in automobiles. The fall conference will be held at Bucknell, probably the day of the Huknell-Lafayette game. The Buck- nellian is planning for a real live conference and will call upon the student body to help put it across. One ol the speakers during the Seventy nfth celebration of Com- j mencem' nt at Bucknell tJnlverslty will be General Tasker"
H.,"Bliss. General Bliss is an alumnus of Buck- nell wh.. has played an Important role in the military and diplomatic affairs <>f the I'nlt.d States, and hl.f return at this time with the matters which he will have to discuss. Is of the highest Interest to both alumni"
who,"will be here at the time and to the present undergrads. Fo^- thl.i reason a short sketch of his life is given li'i-e: General BHbs was born in Lewis- burg on December 31, 1853, the son of the Rev. George Ripley and Mary"
Ann,Bliss. His mother was the daught. r of a professor at the Uni- versity. He attended the
Academy,"for four years and then took two years' work at the l^niversity, leaving for"
W<,-t Point in 1871 and graduat- ing from that institution in 187.'^. Several years later he was an honor graduate of the U. S. Artillery School.
He was,married In 1882.
Upon,"his graduation from West Point. General BlLss was comml-i- i-ioned a HPcond lleutennat in the First ArtiUrey, and in five years he had become a first-lieutenant. In 1892 he was commissioned as capta'n of the commissary subsistence. Just before the outbreak of the Spanish- American"
War,"he was commissioned a major. Following the close of the war he was sent to Cuba to reorgan- ize the customs service, which duty he vcrfc-rmed in a highly efficient manner."
He,also helped to negotiate the treaty between the infant repub- lic and the United States.
m,"1899 he was commissioned lieu- tenant-colonel chief of the commis sarv of subsistence, and after holding the' post of Brigadier General of vol- unteers, was made Brigadier General in the Regular army in 1902."
He,served on several staffs and special missions at this time and

W.,"Rice, Nelson Davis, Jr.. and Harry V."
Thomas,started on a thret-day hike through the mountains. The object of the trip was to produce a
map,in survey outline which would some day
make,possible a bacteriollogical survey of White Deer creek. The party left Lewisburg at 6:25 a. m. and arrived f.t White Deer sta- tion where they started off on foot. Following a course almost due west they arrived at the intake of the *White Deer
Water,
Company,"and her.' were met by Mr. Huff, the care-taker of the"
dam,"and supply station. Mr. Huff proved an admirable guide and accompanied the party as far as Mile Run, at which site"
camp,'Goodland- er' is located. The streams and springs feeding White Deer were pointed out by Mr. Huff
who,"also gave valuable information as to the source of the streams, acid"
camp,"sites located upon them, which in "". bacteriological survey would prove to be valuable information. At"
camp,Goodlander the party had dinner and after bidding Mr. Huff farewell started out alone to trace
White,Deer to Its pource.
The,after- noon found the party will on its
way,"and at 4 p. m. they had reached Z'm- nierman's farm, which is located fourteen miles from the"
dam,and is the source of Sand Spring Run. one of the main trlbutarlts to White Deer Creek. Zimmerman'? farm Is :tJso 1400 feet higher than the dam. which proves that the party had an up-hill Job.

CLUBS,
GIVE,
CONCERT,Last
Monday,"night wltnes.scd one of the biggest treats which the students of Bucknell University havo been given in some time,"
when,the Girls' Glee Club and the Men^s Gldege Club gave a joint concert in
Com-,mencement Hall. The concert
was,scheduled for 8:15 and it began piomptly
on,scheduled time.
"Th""",opening
number,was
"""Come","Bucknell Warriors,"" sung by the two clubs in uni.son."
The,audience greeted this
number,with
much,applause.
The,"second number of the program was the *Gentian,"" sung by the Girl.s' flub. The girls appeared later in the 'Coppah \io..n,"" and did very well in both numbers. The Men's flub also appeared in two numbers, the *Martyrs of the Arnea."" and ""Ho, Gallant Sailors."" All the club"
num-,"bers and encores were very well re- ceived. The Girls' club had a double quar- tette, and the Men's club a slng!'^ quartette. Both organizations did fine work, giving a high type of"
mu-,sic well pre.sented. Each club had one soloist on the program. The Girls' club was rep- resented by Frances VanCleaf in two vocal solos: and the Men's club
was,"represented by Robert Hartz ,who played two violin solos. The"
work,"of both needs no comment, for It is well-known for its excellence at Bucknell."
Two,numbers remain to be
men-,tioned.
They,"are the scene from Carmen, as staged by Cecil Hazen and Caroline Hunt, and the cartooning by Finley Keech. These were the numbers that put the touches of"
humor,"Into the program The Bucknell net-men emergf-d from a conflict with the strong Swarthmore four with what was vir- tually a victory in the shape of a 3-1 tie. Swarthmore has one of the strongest teams in the country for an institution of its size and it cer- tainly was no disgrace to tie them. Swarthmore had an ace in Dudley, their first man. He has been defeat- ed only in the Princeton match thi.^ year."
Many,said he wa.s the best representative of collegiate tennis .seen here for a
number,of years. Both Lybarger and Gedrich played hard
men,"in singles and lost. In doubles. Lybarger and Gedrich could not seem to ""connect."" At one time they had their opponents 5-2 and lost the set, 7-5. Koch ran into .<<ome stiff (jpposition during the first .set of his ma*ch but tightened up and"
won,"the last two. Goho played his usual brand of con- servative tennis and after taking the first set, alternated with his man, winning two out of three. Captain Brandt and Koch played together in doubles and after a hard fight"
won,the match in straight sets. The next match will be with Sus- quehanna at Selinsgrove next Satur- day.
On,the following
Monday,the
New,"York trip will begin, which will include"

TENNIS,"For the first time in the past two years a really interested crowd at- tended the tennis match which wai played last Friday afternoon witli Swarthmore. The fact that tlie stu- dent body are behind their represent- atives even in the most minor of minor sports certainly shows a spirit worthy of commendation. It was an honor for our tennis team to tie Swarthniore because of the latter'.-' ^ast Kecord. They have defeated U. fit P., Lehigh, Army, and other large institutions of repute. The fact that"
we,were able to tie them in the re- cent match was in a large measure due to the support from the sidelines which shows that while our tracli and baseball teams are
away,we will support what we have and do it well.
ANNUAL,
SURVEY,IS
MADE,The cla.s.s in advance Bacteriology
made,its annual survey of Spruce
Run,"on Friday and Saturday. The work, though under the direct supervision of Prof. Rice, was done practically alone by class teams."
Th,".' class was organized into different groups, having a definite part of the arrangements for the trip to care for and see that all preparations pertain- ing to the departure were completed in time and order. The media group consisting of Harry Thomas, chairman in charg<<\ Miss Mackereth, Miss Dodson, Mr. Crowl, Mr. Schultz."
(Herman,"D.), Mr. T. A. Salaczynski. Mr. Roller, had charge of the preparation of all me- dia for the work in the field. The glass-ware group: Miss E. Weidmer. chairman, Miss"
Anna,F'air- child Miss Effie Miller and Miss
K.,"Giover had charge of the preparation and sterilization of all glassware needed in the field and by the media s;roup. Sustenance group; Miss C. Cas- ner, chairman, Mis.s Unger and Miss Swan, on whose shoulders rested the ""eats"" question both in the form of cold lunches and hot meals. Transportation: William Wallace Lewis, chairman. Stewardson. aide. . Hvating plant: Harold Miller, chairman,"
V.,"Evans, aide."
On,Friday morning the class left Lewisbiug at 6:30 and arrived at Spruce
Run,
Dam,"about 8 a. m. Here after noting the points of interest, the first samples were taken and the first plates poured. Here the party divided into throe divisions, two pushing up stream, one on either side, getting samples and one-third taking the truck and Ford.i on to camp. At noon the tliree groups united at the point where the pipe line crosse.^ Spjuce Run. The lunch was served, dfter which the party pushed on to Hagfrstown. At this point the final plates for the day were poured ami then began the tramp over the"
moun,tain through Black Bear
<<ap,"to Davis' camp, ""Hot D>g. '"
When,the highest point in the gap was reached those of the party
who,Hixti not y<<t had their fill of climbing- >>^ere taken to a point still higher where to a good advantage the sur- rounding country could be viewed Mud enjoyed. Ivheft
camp,was reached the sus- tenance committee proved their end of the preparations was fully taken care of.
The,following was served
"""Hot","dog,"" baked potatoes, frie.l ham, fried eggs, baked beans, bread uid butter, coffee. After each had vaHhed his eating utensils and rested I bit the Kir!;*, under the direction of lls/virgina Walton, chaperone of hP trip., and .Nelson Davis. Jr., with several other of the"
men,"as ""aides, went to the Forest House where prep arations had be.n"
made,for them to spend the nighf.
A,"wonderful inci- dent here occurred ""for those"
who,"remained at camp."" Bef.re the ,(de. ha.l reached"
ramp,"Nature began to show her sympathy U>i lliose wlio had been jraliaut and In bo doing drenched those ""poor babes In the wood. "" ""Hot Dog!"""
On,"Saturday morning a ""Whip- poor-Will "" sounded the rising note at 4 a. ni. All hands were on deck at one cabin by four-thirty, except Evans, and due to applied force, soon"
ALL,were busy in some duty or other. Davis soon had a roaring fire go- ing and
Thomas,soon had the
"""ham-","wliat-am"" sizzling. Soon after six the girls arrived at"
camp,"and breakfast, consisting of fried ham, fried potatoes, fried eggs, coffee, sassafras tea, bread and but- ter, wa.s served. Here it was noted that ail domestic talent was not con- fined to the Domestic Science depart- ment. Soon after breakfast the party broke"
camp,"for the completing of the bacteriological survey work. Follow- ing the old Culp railroad after cross- ing the mountain for setting-up ex- ercise, the party reached Spruce"
Run,.Shanty at the headwaters of Spruce
Run,"about ten o'clock. At this point the final plates were poured and all put in order for tlie ascent of San-i Mountain. With Miss Walton in the lead and .setting a goodly pace, the climb, very difficult at times, was"
made,with all reaching the top. Here a second dim!) was afforded those
who,still had the Inclination.
On,the top of Sand Mountain stands a steel towei used by the forest rangers as an out look post
when,on watch for fore;<t rtrvs. The ascent to>>the top is
made,by climbing a steel ladder and the girls proved equal to the task for their names appeared on the register which is found in the cupolo. This point was the greatest height to which some ambitions had gone but It was noticed that during the return to
camp,other heights had not yet been reached and friendly hands picked the dainty lady slippers and bestowed them to the rightful sex. At
camp,"a delightful lunch awaited the liungry crew. Here again baked pickles, fried beans and scrambl'-d potatoes with bread to"
dear,the
way,"and coffee to wash away the traces (if hunger, were thoroughly enjoyed by all. After duly putting all things In order the class started on its home- ward journey about 3:30 p. m. At the Forest Hou.se all were loaded into the Fords and truck and after a shouting farewell to those about, the jolly crowd rolled homeward. During the journey"
homeward,the truck needed more air and here again Miss Dodson supplied the needed ar- ticle with her un-tire-ing efforts.
Much,"might be said concerning undi- viduals but as Evans can vouch. ""It knocks the spots out of city life."" Under the able direction of Profes- sor ""Jack "" Rice and the efficient chaperoning of Miss Walton,"
whom,"the crowd vote on being real .sports, the trip was considered as a huge suc- cess, both in experience gained and fun enjoyed. Selah"

From,this point the party -brushed- tho.r

now,"and tlien into the val- ley for information regarding the .ourse of streams, the party forged ahead to Black Gap. where"
camp,was pitched for the night.
The,following morning found the party on its last lap and well on its
uay,
when,"the sun showed its tirst ravs over the mountain tops. At no'o<< the party had reached its des- tination at the springs of Tunis. Here the pedometers averaged nearly forty-ttve miles, which distance had been covered with sleeping and eat- ing e(iuipment. After resting a short time, the partv started on its"
homeward,"jour- nev."" arriving at Yankee"
Run,
Camp,"at ""the htad of the Fourteen Mile Nar- rows about two o'clock. At thin point the party was met by Harold Miller and were brought to Lewis- burg by Ford. The three days' tramp showed a registrv of approximately fifty mil'-s covered, which, according to Thomas. **with a ton on a man's back is no"
mean,"distance between two points. The weather was ideal and the in- formation gathered will prove valu- able in the future work of the Biolo- gy department, and especially so"

PRE-MED,
ELECTION,"Miss Edgetti brought out the lued of prayer in our daily lives, not only In time of trouble, but at all times. She said prayer should l)e the proct.-^s of talking over our affairs with God. and not mere begging or petitloninv for what"
we,"want, as so"
many,of u^ seem to think. She said
we,should not be dis- couraged if we do not get exactly what
we,"ask f<<)r ,l)ecause often th-' thing wef ask for Is not the real de sire of our hearts, but only a wsih on our lips, and therefore"
we,"do not get it. Besides. God is a loving Father, and"
many,things which
we,"ask for He ..iuinot give us."" becaut"" they are not best for us to have. Not only the practical, raaterlnl an.swer to prayer was given as th- reason for it, but also the spiritual good, th f strengthening fo our char- acter."

LEWISBUEO,
PENNSYLVANU,"<* .J The cast for the Senior class play, * Seven Keys to Baldpate,"" has been (hosen and the play is"
now,well under way. The play is a mystery farce and one of George
M.,"Cohan's r reatest stage successes. It consists ot two acts, every line of which is 'hrouded in mystery and plots and ""ounter-plots. Chairman"
H.,LeRoy Heller has teen working hard to
make,"this the best play ever given in Lewisburg by amateur talent. Because of the large amount of talent in the class of 21, both male and female, it is .sure to be a huge succeas. One of the most prominent features will be the uppearance of Miss .Martha Leiser in the lead. Miss Leiser will appear as ""Mary Norton,"" a newspaper report- < r; and tlie play will be centered on her and on"
H.,
LeRoy,Heller. These two prominent stage artists have ap- peared in the lead together in
many,plays during their four college yean^ and this will be their final play at Bucknell. .Miss Leiser's
home,is in Lewisburg nd she is a daughter of
Howard,Loiser.
Even,before entering Buck- nell and while still in high school ^he attracted great attention by her marvelous acting and pleased every- one with her great ability. During her college career she has taken prominent parts in practically all Frill and
Frown,and Cap and Dag- ger plays
and,
many,other plays that have been given In Lewisburg. This epring she had the honor of being chosen as
May,"Queen, an honor she also had while in high school."
H.,
LeRoy,"Heller, whose"
home,"is 5n Reading, has al.so attracted"
much,attention
by,his marvelous ability during his four years here. This is his fourth year as a
member,"of Cap and Dagger, In -which he took a prom- inent part, playing the lead in a great"
many,of that society's successful pro- ductions.
The,rest of the cast have appeared frequently in productions here and all possess ability to fulfill their parts in great style. This will be the last chance to see these art- ists together at Bucknell.
The,play is being directed by
"Hack""","Gibson, which further in- .=ures it as a success. It will be giv- en in"
Commencement,Hall. All seats will be reserved and will be placed on sale at Heiser's
Drug,"Store on Wednesday of this week. Seats will also be sold the evening of hte pre- sentation on the ""Hill."" starting at seven o'clock"
The,advertising Is out and the '* novel large posters are attracting
much,"attention. Special scenery is to be had for the production and this is being ob- tained from the Ameliagrain .studio of Philadelphia. The costumes and wigs are being obtained from the Charles D. Christy Co., of"
New,York City.
The,story begins in
New,"York City. William Hallowell Magee, a novelist, played by Heller, makes a bet that be can write a twenty-four thousand word story in twenty-four hours, providing he has absolute se- clusion."
The,friend with
whom,"he makes the bet, owns the Baldpate Inn, In-the mountains, and gives him the key to the inn, telling"
him,"it i^ the only key, and as the inn is un- occupied, he can find seclu.sion there."
Magee,"arrives at the'inn in the even- ing and finds the caretaker,"
who,ha.-i
made,arrangements for his coming.
He,proposes to start work
when,"he is interrupted by a crook,"
who,opens the door with a kep and puts some
money,"In the inn safe. After a .scuf- fle, Magee succeeds in locking him in"
a,room.
Th(c),next interruption is from a newspaper reporter and her ehaperone.

May,"I'Jth, wat a ital treat to all music Jovert. The orchestra consisted of twelve vlclins assisted by a viola, violin-cello, fiute and clarinet. ""Spanish Dances"" afforded a mcKt attiative introduction and the "" Un- tinii-htd"
"Symphony""",as a cloFing
number,was undoubtedly the finest production of the t-vening. Miss Arra- strong'a conducting and interpreta- tion
was,of the highest order. The difficult solo of Eloii^e Hill
was,ar- tistically rendered
and,most enthu- siastically received.
Norman,"Apple- ton's solo also was beautifully play- ed. Both had rich tone quality. Another feature of the program -huh *'Peer Gynt Suite."""
The,"lovely sub- dued ""Ase's Death"" being followed by the sprightly ""Amti's Dance"" made a most effective contra.st. The ensemble numbers were popular and the solos of"
Roy,"Stein and E^tht Fleming, assisted by all the violin in unison were splendidly done. Thf accompaniment of Miss Bergstretst and Miss Kathryn"
Wagner,"furni.'^h"" ed able background for the solois^ts"
Much,credit is due Miss Arm- strong for her untiring efforts and her marked accomplishment v.ith the orchestra. These concerts. Mke all the recitals of the School < Music are of the highest grade ai.u are gratefully enjoyed by a la^j-f portion of the student body.

who,have been attached to the faculty for fifty and forty years respectively. Seldom has the club lieen decked in such gala attire as it was on Tues- day evening.
The,huge Bucknell flag was hung at one end of the ball room
and,"an Aemrican flag at an- other, while garlands of pine and leaves were' used for further decor- ation. The tables were arranged in a hollow square, the toastmaster and speakers of the evening, with their wives, being seated at the head table. The color scheme of the tables was orange and blue, which was carried out by the use of orange and blue candles. At each plate was laid a white carnation and bouquet.^ of the carnations were also to be found on the tables. The blest^lng was asked by Rev. John T. Judd. Treasurer of the Uni- versity. Immediately following the blessing. Registrar Clark announced that"
two,of the college
women,would come to everyone present and secure their signature on souvenir programs for Dr. Martin and Dr. Bartol. Music was furnished during the ev- ening by a norchestra composed of Turn to Page Four Buei nell b!unked the Pittsburgh Collegians last Wednesday on the

who,"are to lead in a distinctly religiouif organization. Methods of work were suggested >>rJ discu.ssed, but the ;dta was made clear that methods in"

known,"to every Bucknell student as *Mac."" and dear to the heart and higrt tn the esteem of every Buck- nellian, paid a visit over the week end to Bucknell and to his"
Kappa,Signui fraternity brothers.
He,"was present at the track meet in the af- ternoon,"
when,he was warmly greeted by everyone and the student body showed their esteem for
him,in a rousing cheer.

CLEAN,
POLITICS?,
A,"great deal of hot air has been blowing around during the last few months about ""cleaning up college politic.-^."" The cla.ss of '23. first as usual in any"
new,
movement,ha.<
made,"a forward st.^p in this direc- tion. The-manner fo *23's last <^^lass election w.u epoc making. Last Thursday afternoon at 4.30 the Sophomore claas.s elected the editor and busine,>s"
manager,"of next year'.s L'agenda. offices which. In the opin- ion of many, are the most important in a college course. The only public announcement of this meeting was given at Chapel Thursday morning, at whi-h time, less than half the Sophomore"
men,are present.
No,notice whatsoever appeared on any of the bulletin board.s. The suppo.sition is that election was
managed,in this
way,"in order to eliminate the possi- bilitv of any framedup combination coming prepared to carry off the election. The point to be established in this inference, however is that no college r;roup had any informa- tion other than the chapel announce- ment. Whether the idea was ""clean politics"" or politics otherwise is a matter which everyone"
who,"is inter- ested must judge from the facts of the case. If the decision Is ""clean,"" well and sood. If it is ""otherwi.se"" some acti)n .should be taken in the matter of future elections."
A,good suggestion is a ruling which will require a three-day notice of any election and an announcement in both sections of chapel. A. Sophomore.

W.,"C. A., to dla- cu.s.s nujtual problems. Miss Burke said that the.se were a few of the questions that the In- dustrial girls asked the college girls. .She said both groups greatly enjoyed and profited by the contact with each other, and she found the Industrial girls clear thinking, eager and with serious purpose; not light minded or frivolous."
When,"the college girls asked their industrial friends their Idea of u good job. the answer was; Good surroundings, recreation room and .some say in the management. Pay was not once brought into the dis- cussion. The girls care more for be- ing treated like"
human,"beings than for the pay. As for tlielr attitude towards col- lege, most of them feel that the pre - cnt college sy.stem bars Industrial girls, and should be changed so as to include industrial and vocational subjects."

W^,39th St.
New,"York City. Advisory Deoartment. In order to accomplish the purpose of the.se articles more than tlie bar*' statement of historical dates is need- ed. Somethnig of the humorous, something of the personal element is needed to get real insight Into the early spirit of Bucknell. The ar- ticles printed are cho.sen with this object in mind. The first is written from investigation by a present stu- dent, the seocnd by tlie only living"
member,of the first cla.ss graduated from the college.
Ye,"Old Annals i leaf through the tjld annaJ.s of, the University of Lewisburg with a feeling of"
awe,"and respect, touched occasionally by a tingle of humor. The"
awe,and respect Is due no doubt to the picture gallery therein of the sturdy burghers
who,"laid the foun- dation of this university. As I write, the stern, .set face of one of the fathers of knowledge lies before"
me,and his eyes are glaring angrijy at
me,because he knows I
am,wondering whether barbers and lawn-mower were luxuries in his time. As for the
humor,"in the annals well, ligures"
AUE,humorous if
we,allow them to tell their tale. The worthy book slates that tuition in the collegiate department is. thirty dol- lars per year and room rent seven dollars and a half per year. 1
am,wondering if the professors of that period were retired bankers or train robbers.
Then,"again, student-s are admonished not to bring any pocket"
money,with them so that they
may,not be tempted to riotous living.
And,then to drive
home,"the Importance of proper morals, each student, whether tie will or no, was a"
member,"of the , Society of Moral and Religious In- (|uiry."" Our worthy Baptist found- ers were evidently conservatLsts in , religious matters. i But"
my,"purpose is to find out facts : and figures of the founding of our I university so I turn back to the first 'page of the annals and read: ""The I Northumberland Baptist Association i met in 1845 and resolved to found a high school for males, another for females, a college, and also a theo- logical institute."
The,"charter of the university at Lewisburg was signed on February 5, 1&46, by the governor of Pennsylvania. Stephen"
H.,"Taylor was elected principal of the school and on October 5 of the same year, classes were organized in the base- ment of the Baptist church until the completion of the building. The fac- ulty consisted of Stephen"
H.,"Taylor. A. M.. profes.sor of mathematics and natural philosophy; Rev. George R. Bliss, professor of Greek language and literature; Geofge"
H.,Ander.son. A. M.. professor of Latin language and literature; Isaac
N.,"Loomis,"
A,M.. principal of the Academy; Alfred Taylor. A.
M..,tutor of English lan- guage and elocution; and
Norman,"Ball, principal of the primary de- partment. In 1848 the academy building was completed and plans were"
made,"for the building of main college. In 1850-51. on the motion of Han. James Buchanan, afterward presi- dent of the United States, degrees were conferred upon the first class presented for graduation"
--,so- mi in number. At that time the attend- ance was as follows: College 61.
Academy,"117, Female Institute 48."
making,a total of 226. In 1851-5 2
Howard,Malcolm be-
came,"president upon the resignation of Dr. Taylor. Forty-five thousand dollars was raised for buildings and the Ladles' Institute was moved into the building at the corner of Second and St. Louis streets, with Miss Had- assah Scribner as principal. In 1854-55 the theological depart-"
ment,"was established and the first class, two In number, graduated from the institute."
REMINISCENCES,moved with
my,father to a point near Rus.selvllle. Here I becanje Interest- ed in the study of Latin. Later I studied Greek for several years under the direction of
my,"father, completing In this"
way,Xenophon'.j Anabasis and
much,of the
New,"Tes- tament. In 18,j4. having united with the Beulah Baptist church at the age of fiixteen, I attempted to preach in vai;ious places. In 1847 I noticed a movement had been for .some time on foot to establish the ""University at Lewisburg. "" I"
made,arrange- ments to go. and reached our Stat capital by rail. I remembered a part of a lesson in Olney's Geography lik-j this:
"""What","is a canal?"" Answer:"
"""A","canal is an artificial channel filled with water, for the easy, speedy and cheap transportation of good; from one section of the country to another."" I wanted to see a canal and sail on one; but a fre.shet had put the Susquehanna canal out of business and I had to take a stage and travel all night. In the fore- noon of the next day the driver stopped at the end of the old Market streei bridge and handed"
down,
my,"trunk. Not liking to leave it here as it was, I could but pick It up and walk across. I found the university in a brick church edifice on the sit of the present music hall. There were three rooms in the basement. In the largest one there were rows of plain red desks at which the students were seated."
On,"one aide the girls, and on the other side, the boys. But our seats faced different ways. If we looked around once in a while there was no"
harm,done. Talk about co- education being a tentative matter.
We,had it
away,back In 1847 and I was brought up to It and liked it. It was a happy day
when,the Acad-
emy,was finished and
many,of us took our desks on our heads and marched up to the hill the lids of the desks clapping us on our march. Still
we,had the girls on the other side and were proud to consider them our better half. Noble girls I believe them to be and felt that their influ- ence was salutory. They were forming a Freshman class
when,I arrived in Lewisburg and I was ascribed a place in it and
we,were Seniors all the
way,through college.' Doctor S.
W.,Taylor was a good and great man. His chair had formerly been mathematics and natural philosophy but he was at
home,"everywhere teaching us to demonstrate problems in geometry, unravallng the involved sentences of Livy, or scanning the odes of Horace."
He,had as a.s.sistants his gifted son Alfred and the gentlemanly I.
N.,Loomis. They were all highly re- gaidej. During
my,second ye^ar the facu'ty was reinforced by the com- ing of Professor Bliss to occupy the chilr of Greek language and litera- ture. Prof .G.
W.,Anderson that of that of Latin and Prof. C. S. James the chair of chemistry.
The,west wing was soon completed and
we,be- gan to feel that
we,were growing Im- portant.
Young,
men,today looking over the beautiful wooded slopes can scarcely picture the wild woods of that time and the boys at intermis- sion wading through the fallen leaves ana gathering into heaps the brush that cumbered the ground. After a time
we,were cheered by the coming of some phllo.sophical ap- paratus. Dr. Taylor used to take the telescope on his shoulders in the ev- ening and go up to the crest where the main edifice
now,stands and show us the wonders of the starry heavens. But 1851 came and seven young
men,graduated.
Commencement,Hall was the large upper room of the Academy.
We,"had a beautiful green arch sprung over the platform and a Latin verb ""Ducimus"" festooned above us f we said"
"""We","lead the way."" That is a day 1 shall never forget. The tender farewell remarks of Dr. Tay- lor"
--,his last official act in Lewis- burg
--,drew tears from every eye. Then the thoughts of parting from each other after such long and pleas- ant associations
moved,us. The

DANCE,"i Delta Sigma ""stepped out"" over | the week-end. Activities began on Friday evening with th>> formal at the Lewisburg club. About forty couples danced to the music furiiished by Al<\ander's orchestra, from 9. until 2. At 12 intermission was announced and .refreshments were served. For the remainder of the week-end canoeing, motoring and"
many,other diversions were in order. Delta Sig-
ma,and its guests had an enjoyable week-end. The Improvement on the tennis court of the
Kappa,"Sigs is progress- ing rapidly and Is nearing completion. The court had been too uneven and was not the best of courts, so it was decided to turn it north and south and"
make,"a good court out of it. The .site was -;i.i(leil :\;:J a founda- tion of red shale put in. Then a layer of cinders was added and the top layer of fine red clay has just been added. After rolling and the putting up of back-stops and sod- ding of the surroundings, a mighty fine court Is expected. i'AGh."

when,
we,umassed a greater
number,"of points and pushed on into the lead. Our victory was due to no individual star, but rather to a well-balanced team. All but two of the"

mudi,"credit i= due Editor Keech and his staff in present- j ing such a voluminous work, covering as it does every phase of the life on the 'Hni."" It is the very last word in college annuals for the year, and presents an appearance really dis- tinctive in character and of the neat- est kind of workmanship throughout the publication. Especially fine !.- the photo engraving work,"" which shows just that touch of the artistic that savors of the best. Th"" book i^ divided into twelve departments, each cne complete in itself and cover ing that particular phase of the in- terest of the students and classes, r-nd from cover to cover it is filled v.ith real ""flavor"" that makes the life at college seem"
more,"worth while. The cover of the book is of ir.M tation leather, with the words. ""L- ' Agenda. 1922."" neatly arranged nt the top. and with a design of the 6th [street enrtance to the campus"
em,f I bossed underneath in a circle at the 'center of the cover..
The,various headings of the drpartments wer?
drawn,"by Miss Myra Efflnger. 2'!. and the editor of the bonk, while the calendar drawings were executed by Carl Goerlitz, with"
much,credit to the standard of the art work of the pub llcatlon. One feature that is
new,and es- pecially worth mention is the
Cameo,"plate view section, covering eight pages near the front of Ihi book"
Many,
new,"photos of the campus and [surroundings are here depicted in the neatest possible manner, and Instead of the customary line, telling exactly what the particular scene is. there appears a verse of poetry or lines from some of the masters that seem especially papropriate for that scene, and which adds a touch of college spirit even to the view section. The arrangement of the classes Is Turn to Page Four Dickinson vs. Bucknell"
Down,at Carlisle the
home,"team succeeded in cashing in on a ba.se hit and an error during the first lim"" at bat, while Bucknell was retired in | 1, 2, 3 order. j But in the second inning. Orange and Blue"
men,dashed over the
home,plate for three tallies. Linker w^nt first on an error and Julian'.-^ single advanced him a base. With Harris on first thru an error things were ripe for Deitrlck and Jones singles. after Bunting and DeCoursey had been caught out. Dickinson scored once more

With,"this, the last i-wue of the Bucknellian for the college year of 1920 21, it siceniH appropriate for the"
new,
management,to say a few words *sith r;?speot to the policy and aims of the Hucknellian for the coming year.
The,paramount duty of any news paper is to collect and publi.sh news.
The,",-phere of the Bucltnellian In- dUitlew every college activity In which the student body as a whole is inter- v..sted"
We,"aim not only to report ac- HvitlGH but to give extended space to advaiT'e publicity. The fulfillment H)I thi.s aim depends upon the coop- eratiuu of every organization in .sub- mitting this ""advance dope"" to the ttditor. Extensive plans are"
now,under
way,whereby the Bucknelliar will he able to reach every colleg-- activity in a
much,more .satisfactory
way,than
we,have been able to do in the pafit. It will also b.-
made,ea.sy Tor any student to submit news dur- inB the co-ning year without taking a dry off to hunt the editor.
A,very important consideration to
any,"newspaper i.s Its ""politics.' A< a KUicilng hand to public opinion thj pr<<.'s wiplds a miphty power, for good ^n- for evil, depending upon its edi- tAirial policy or its ""politics."""
The,"politics of the Bucknellian. as stated in thi.^ years' L' Agenda, is ""a square d<<al for everybody."" With us this i<< not hot air, it means a determina-"
tkm,on the part of the editorial

dorms,"to the station. Moravian proved an easy victim for the local boys, losing by a 6-0 score. They were unable to annex a single match and the best thing they had were good courts. All of our team played good tennis and"
won,everything. The scores were. Singles Lybarger defeated Hoffman 6-2. 6-1. Gedrich defeated Williams 6-3. 6-2. Speare defeated Marks. 6-0. 6-0.
Koch,"defeated Minert 6.3, 6-4. Doubles Lybarger and Speare defeated Hoffman and Williams, 6-2. 4-6, 6-4. Gedrich and"
Koch,"defeated Marks and Minert 6-3, 6-2. Lehigh gave the Bucknell team a nice write-up In the school paper and mentioned the fact that Lehigh would have difficulty in beating Bucknell. The score was 5-1. with our net"
men,on the big end. Koch
was,the only
man,to lose. Lybarger played the highly reput ed Beck
who,is rated
among,the first ten
men,of Philadelphia on the courts. Gedrich and Speare both played well and won.
The,"scores were: Singles Lybarger defeated Beck 6-3. 0-6 Gedrich defeated Sparr. 6-4, 6-3. .Speare defeated Coel 6-3. 6-3."
Wentz,"defeated Koch 6-3. 2-6. Doubles Lybarger and Koch defeated Beck and Sparr. 6-3. 3-6, 7-5. Gedrich and Speare defeated Coe! and"
Wentz,6-3. 6-2. The strain of the Lehigh match proved too
much,for the local
men,"and the best they could do was to tif"" Lafayette on very poor courts. Mena. Lafayette's first man. exhib Ited a wonderful brand of tennis"
when,he defeated Lybarger 6-0. 6-1.
The,"scores were: Singles .M.Mia defeated Lybarger 6-0, 6-1."
Shumway,defeated Gedrich 6-3. 6-4 Speare defeated Mitchell 6-3. 6-2. Koch dpft'at^d Whalln 6-3. 3-6. 6-4 Doubles
Mena,and
Shumway,"defeated Ly barger and Koch 6-3. 6-3. Speare and Gedrich defeated Mitchell and Whalln. 10-S. 6-0. The completion of this trip leaves the tennis team undefeated, with a record of defeating Penn State, City (ollc;>;.> of .New York. Moravian, Le high. Susquehanna (two matches). and tleini? Swarthmore and Lafay- ette. It is very probable that Man- ager Sowers will arrange to play State College a return match on loca! courts on June 10th."

HOW,
OUR,
STATE,
CAPITOL,
WAS,
SAVED,
IN,1863
The,"8tudent.s of the Unlvernlty at Lewl.sbuiK ""were enrolled as Com- pany A, Twenty-eighth ReKJineut/ Pennsylvania Volunteer Mllltla, on the <<lxteenth day of June. 1863. and were mustered Into the service of ttic United States a.s such for the period during existing emergency from th'-' nineteenth day of June, 1S6:;. and they were honorably discharged at llurri.sburg. Pa.. July 27, 186:5."""
Thus,reads
my,discharge. But this enrollment and mustering In was ac- complished with some trouble. Gov- ernor Curtin and Secretary Stanton could not come to terms. Stanton did not wish to enroll any one for a longer period but Governor Curtin wished them mustered In for the ex- isting emergency. For
many,"days we camped on Capitol Hill at Har- risburg, until dissatisfaction existed"
among,"the members and several under various pretexts wanted to go home."""
W.,J. (Billy) Wolverton got
R.,A.
Townsend,to
mount,"a store- goods box and deliver an address. As his voice rolled over the ground-^ soldiers started up from every blade of grass, and before the address was completed Capitol Hill was well filled with those desiring to be mustered in. Townsend, on the shoulders o' some stalwart men, was paraded around the grounds, and these same"
men,wanted to take him
down,"town but by the intercession of Captain Jones, Townsend was released from his captors. Whether this demonstra- tion hud any effect upon the official.! I"
know,not; but after the lapse of thirty-seven years
my,
memory,"recall.i events thus: The address was de lievred about 9 a. m.; at 3 p. m. w(i were mustered Into the United Statej .service and received our equipments, and ut 5 p. m."
we,"marched across the bridge to Sporting Hill, where a con- flict took place and tiie Twenty- eighth Regiment was u participant."
Company,
A,"(Stiidents of the Unl veralty at Lewisburg) was detailed to proceed n(irth along the west bank of the Susquehanna toward.s the western end of the Pennsylvania Railroad bridge, and soon after leav Ing Sporting Hill they unconsciously ran into iniinent dangjer."
The,"Con federate officers, mentioned above, informed"
me,that they had a perfect
map,of the Susquehanna river from the Juniata down.
They,knew where there were fords between Harrisburg and the Pennsylvania railroad bridge.
Company,
A,"traversed this whole dis tance. While resting on the march, we were Informed that the Confed erate forces had left that position only a little while before our coming."
My,Southern friends informed me that they meditated a quick pa.ssage of the river
--,"hoped then to disperse the raw and unarmed troops, burn the capitul city iiuickly repa.ss the rivi.T and rejoin their army, but that com- ing of Union forces"
and,the supposi- tion that others would follow deterred them from the attempt.
Company,
A,comprised the only troops that pa-ssed along the route.
From,thei^e facts It Is beyond question that the students of the University at Lewi.-i- burg saved the State Capitol In June. 1863 I would like to find the place where
we,"halted and received the in- formation and mark it with an ap- propriate tablet bearing the Inscrlp tlon: ""Here the students of the Uni- versity at Lewisburg saved the State Capitol In 1863."""
